I will te rate once I have viewed them. REVISED Ok watching them and was good til I got to disc 4 episode 124 pixelating real bad and won't even play 125 and 126. Says disc error and it's not the DVD player.  Just quickly  checked other 3. Disc 5 and 7 are  bad 6  seams ok just quickly looking at it.
