300096,5,6300275035,"As a youth, I remember watching ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" (which, if I'm not mistaken, was later renamed ""The Wonderful World of Color"").  It was on every Sunday night and would feature cartoons, a serial program like ""Davie Crocket: King of the Wild Frontier"", or any variety of other Disney-worthy productions including a number of nature programs.  I believe it was on that TV show that I first saw ""The Living Desert"".  It won an Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary in 1953.

The photography is the key and the producers wanted us to understand that right from the beginning.  The introductary comments mention that the film is the result of hundreds of hours of patient work by wildlife photographers.  The ensuing glimpses of wildlife in the desert is fascinating.  We see scenes of survival, persistance, and, to put it delicately, the food chain in action.  Some of the shots, especially that of a particular bobcat, make one wonder if a little bit of help was arranged to create some of the scenes but it's still a very humorous sequence.  Typically, for a Disney production, much of the movie is instructive and informative.  Also typical for Disney, the movie will appeal to all ages.  Watching ""The Living Desert"" is certainly time well spent.",1167004800,6,1275,4.911214953271028
300097,5,6300275035,"Sometimes I love Disney, sometimes I wonder if they sit on their brains. This is one of the finest movie documentaries they ever produced and yet here it is 2006 well beyond when they started making DVDs and it is not on DVD. Do you see something wrong with that picture as I do? I saw this as a kid on the Wonderful World of Disney and I loved it. I was entertained and educated at the same time. The best way for kids to learn. Unfortunately I have not seen it since. I imagine some of those that have the Disney channel may have caught it at some point if it was televised again. I buy all the movies they made and ran on their TV series back in the 1960s, I can only hope they realize this classic should be put on DVD as well. If you get a chance to watch it on VHS or TV be sure to catch it. As old as it is it still very entertaining and informative.

Addendum: They finally released this with other specials from the Wonderful World of Disney. There are four volumes in the Walt Disney Legacy Collection. This is on Volume Two.",1150675200,4,1035,4.073529411764706
300098,5,6300275035,Walt Disney's Living Desert is the finest desert nature footage ever produced--the standard. Released in 1953 in full color it took 3 years to make. It has many fine points including a 2:25 breathtaking sequence in which a large female wasp subdues and paralyzes a tarantula with her stinger. Beautiful botanical time lapse photography is also featured. The Best Documentary Oscar was created for The Living Desert and it was the first recipient of the award. What more can I say---everyone young and old should have the opportunity to see this film.,1055548800,29,550,4.989130434782608

300145,5,6300275035,"Classic old narration style of Disney Nature. It's hard to claim candid photography when you follow a smake until he devours a mouse and gulps it down. Still, Disney did it great within limitations, maybe better that the Disney Nature films of today. I showed it to my class of 4th graders while studying the desert ecosystem and they loved it. It greatly improved their vocabulary on a post test as well. This is worth a couple bucks to rent and show.",1445644800,,452,4.524390243902439

300221,5,6300275035,"I just saw this for the first time, and WOW!  Why would I recommend this over 60 year old Disney production made back in 1953?  Because it is simply spectacular!  With its breathtaking beauty, high comedy, heart stopping drama, and almost unbelievable cinematography, it takes you into the life of the desert in ways I guarantee you haven't seen before.  It will alternately have you biting your knuckles, laughing hilariously, cheering for bugs, rats and spiders, and sighing at the beauty of it all.  I think this film stands as a masterpiece today, and an almost unbelievable achievement for sixty years ago.  Highly, highly recommended.",1413676800,,640,5.0476190476190474

300226,5,6300275035,"The scorpion dance is the best part. The movie starts out talking about how desolate and barren the desert is. Finally it shows it's not completely, well, deserted.

300227,5,6300275035,"Released in 1953, ""The Living Desert"" documents the lives of animals and plants in the Death Valley area.  Death Valley is a section of the Mojave Desert in eastern California, and it is the lowest and driest area in North America.

Never boring, this 69 minute film explores the ""grim desert drama"" of the diverse wildlife's struggle to survive. We are shown a battle between a rattlesnake and a red-tailed hawk (excellent), a fight between a tarantula and a very determined tarantula wasp (amazing), and a ... disagreement ... between a bobcat and a few wild boars (sort-of funny).  We also get to see the gymnastics of kangaroo rats, the ballet of a sidewinder snake, and the zaniness of a road runner.  There is also the mystery of the moving boulders and the power of a flash flood.

Interesting and informative, ""The Living Desert"" takes the audience through an apparent 48 hour period (though, in fact, the movie took 3 years to film).  The camera work here is outstanding ... truly.  The narration is also excellent.  Well written and witty throughout, it often instills human behaviors into that of animals and bugs .... always with humorous results.  The narrator was well chosen.  His intelligent yet kind voice (and personality) adds a friendly quality to the film.  Likewise, the background music is perfectly suited to the various activities of the wildlife.

Walt won the academy award for best documentary for this film.  In fact, ""The Living Desert"" was so good that the academy saw fit to create a new Oscar category to honor it (documentaries).

It should be noted that, thankfully, none of the cute animals in the movie get caught and eaten.  There are some close calls, but it is only the bad guys who ... bite the dust.",1395619200,3,1741,4.775919732441472

300262,4,6300275035,"With nature films like David Attenborough's around, you would think that a sixty-year old Disney film would look really primitive.  But the cinematography is surprisingly good, and my grandsons (age 4 to 11) LOVED this film and watched it over and over.  The narration is a little corny and saccharine, but the message about diversity of life in the American southwest desert is timeless.  This film (along with The Vanishing Prairie) made me choose a biology career.  It can still inspire.  (Don't expect high-def video though.)",1377216000,,529,5.104651162790698
