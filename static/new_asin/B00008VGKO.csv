7987183,4,B00008VGKO,"The C- is a grade I'm giving myself on Spanish Comprehension, and that's being generous. The documentary is in Spanish and is probably an excellent history lesson if you understand Spanish. It has early 1900's film and still pictures. I was interested in learning more about ""The Storm that Swept Mexico""after watching the PBS special.

There's also entertaining mariachi music with songs lamenting or celebrating the action on the screen. Sometimes through the songs, I can gain comprehension of the narration.

Hey, I bought this at an excellent price on Amazon and it got shipped quickly so I can't complain.

I would recommend if you're a C+ or better in the Spanish language, otherwise I highly recommend the PBS documentary, ""The Storm that Swept Mexico.""

For me, the verdict is still out on how good or bad was Pancho Villa. The PBS doc acknowledges he was bad but that he did a lot of good to help free Mexico of the crooked presidents and help the indigenous and the poor. In this one, I'm ""comprehending"" he was more bad than good. He opened up schools for children in Northern Mexico but he savagely looted from the rich.

Word from generations who lived back then was that when Pancho Villa and his bandits rode into town, you hid the women and girls.

He is ... a legend.

Should statues be put up of him? In the U.S.?  As far north as Minnesota?

Not for me to decide. I'm only a C- student in Spanish language comprehension.",1357171200,2,1440,4.6156862745098035
7987184,3,B00008VGKO,"This documentary looks like it would be really cool, and I am sure it is.  But the narrator's voice is overpowered by the background music.  Although I am not fluent in Spanish, I have taken many university classes taught only in Spanish and can easily follow spoken (textbook) Spanish.  But, as I just said, the background music overpowers the narrator's voice.  And on top of that, the narrator has a deep voice, which itself is hard to understand.  But if you are fluent in Spanish and can understand many types/accents of Spanish then you will probably do fine.  Every now and then I put the DVD in, turn up the volume, and hope that I can finally hear what the narrator is saying.",1252195200,5,685,4.528455284552845
7987185,5,B00008VGKO,"This documentary is based on historian Enrique Krauze's 1987 ""La Biografia del Poder,"" and is narrated by the author in a rapid, soft-spoken but pleasant voice. It was produced for Televisa as part of the Mexico Siglo XX series, and contains riveting archival footage of early 20th century history in Mexico, which was turbulent and full of violence. Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa (1878-1923) was a charismatic, complex character, who it is said was ""hated by thousands and loved by millions,"" and is sometimes called ""El Robin Hood Mexicano."" Few can agree on who and what Villa was, and even his supporters would say things like ""he is good at heart, but circumstances made him bad."" Was he a bad man with good motives...a good man with a very dark side? Only one thing is certain, he was to play a pivotal part in Mexico's history, and watching the film footage of him (as well as his contemporaries) is fascinating viewing.

There are marvelous scenes from the Raoul Walsh 1912 documentary ""The Life of Villa."" One can tell looking at either still photographs or film, that Villa loved the camera, and enjoyed being ""Superstar,"" and having a director follow him recording his every move. There is also the story of when General Pershing pursued Villa, after Villa's raid into New Mexico territory, and could not find him, admitting ""Villa is everywhere...and nowhere.""

Excellent for history buffs, students of Mexican culture, and those who appreciate archival films of the past, ""Pancho Villa: El Angel y el Fierro"" will interest many. Though the DVD box says ""color,"" except for a brief red flame superimposed over an eye, it is b&w, and most of the footage is in exceptional condition considering its age. No subtitles available. Total running time approximately 45 minutes.",1175644800,21,1777,4.97979797979798
