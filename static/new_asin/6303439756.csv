676575,2,6303439756,"Hardly the first time that a scifi concept proposed a society that was plugged into an alternate reality. But this low-budget flick is one that I typically point to whenever an argument of ""Who Beat The Matrix"" pops up - as the typical fanboy is too young to realize that Oshii's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avalon/dp/B0000D9PNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avalon</a>' was not nearly as innovative and creative as they would like to think.

Tells the story of a young woman, Judy, one of the social elites who is discovered to be a mind rebel. By way of a computer jack inserted in the back of the brain, she's constantly disengaging from their chosen InfiniSynth virtual realities - a computer program which keeps the populace mentally occupied and engaged since there's nothing to do in their protected and sterile underground shelter. She demands to be set free, unplugged from the program, to experience ""real life"" outside of their hermetically sealed civilization.

Her wish is granted.

Judy soon discovers that real life in a post-nuclear world is not nearly as liberating as she had envisioned. Beyond the desolate landscape there's virtually nothing left save the roving bands of cannibal mutants. Almost hunted into a dinner pot, her rescuer comes in the form of an early Bruce Campbell performance. Playing the character of Stover, he's one of the few normals - survivors who have preserved their humanity and scrounge a meager existence while hiding from the freaks.

While she explores a genuine human relationship not tied to her brainjack - life in the real world is unpredictably brutal. Soon their special together time is crashed in by the mutants. Worse, she discovers that the leader of the cannibal horde is her long-lost, thought to be dead, father. A dad who seems intent on reseeding the world with their hellish progeny - including having an incestuous relationship with his own daughter!

Yikes. El Slimebag.

No surprise - Stover heroically sacrifices himself to save Judy, who manages to make her way back to the enclave. Her extreme experiences - living free, finding real human love, captured, nearly raped by her own dad, and finally saved from the cannibals - have obviously changed her. But is it enough of a revelation? Too much of one? Once again she's given the choice between the InfiniSynth computer program and reality, what will she choose?

Did I mention this was produced by the same folks that publish legendary Fangoria Magazine? So note that bloody gore is abundant and freely flowing, especially if you're able to watch the uncut version of the flick.

S'okay. Middling interest. I'm not really into slasher/gore type flicks. But this B-movie touches upon several scifi themes and styles - making for an interesting blend of genres.

676578,1,6303439756,"This is the perfect example of a great idea ruined by the worst acting of all time. The female lead is so horrendous that any seriousness that the movie intends to convey (and there is a great deal) was lost. I was impressed by certain visuals, primarily the infinisynth sequence at the beginning of the movie, but there is so much cheesiness in terms of mere acting that this movie is impossible to watch from beginning to end. Seriously, I want my 3 dollars back. Someone trustworthy should make a remake of this garbage heap, as the story and concept itself have promise...",1311897600,,576,4.601941747572815
676579,3,6303439756,"THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS

If somebody came up to you and started describing a sci-fi film where people plug themselves in to a virtual reality through inputs located on the back of their neck, but then followed that up by saying that it wasn't The Matrix then you'd probably think that it was some sort of bad riddle. In retrospect, it probably is in a way but a little film called Mindwarp used this concept seven years before The Matrix did. While Mindwarp isn't nearly as flashy or anywhere near the same category of success as The Matrix (or as good), it can probably pass for one of those sci-fi films you catch sporadically during a fit of insomnia while flipping through channels during the infancy of the day and enjoying more than you thought you would.

The similarities to Total Recall will make themselves apparent right away, but Mindwarp doesn't take long to throw you into a post-apocalyptic world you'd expect to see The Road Warrior loitering around looking for an opportunity to relish what was thought to be a dried up natural resource. While Mindwarp can be considered a sci-fi film on the surface, it's most likely a horror film at its roots and that becomes apparent as soon as you realize who's a part of the cast. Bruce ""don't call me Ash"" Campbell plays the love interest for Marta Martin's Judy while The Tall Man himself, Angus Scrimm, portrays the villainous Seer. While the uniting of these two actors in one film is exciting to horror fans, aficionados may be disappointed when they realize that both Campbell and Scrimm basically have glorified cameos in the film. Neither of their parts seem very large once the film ends, but at least you get to see Campbell get infested by leeches and basically no-sell throwing up his intestines.

Mindwarp is gloriously grotesque, as well. It doesn't even try to shy away from blood or gore, which is fantastic for bloodthirsty horror fans. A perfect example is the meat grinding device the Seer uses as punishment to individuals who disobey him. The device is made from parts you'd find in a garbage dump along with a plethora of human skulls. After the unfortunate victim goes through the machine, their blood is spewed into a bathtub where the Crawlers, a deformed cannibalistic civilization that lives underground, drink the victim's blood. But with all the comparisons to horror come many of the same downfalls many films of the genre have. Mindwarp was made in the early 90's and the leftover cheese from the 80's makes its way into the film practically effortlessly. That means the few attempts at humor in the film will probably make you verbally groan. The acting is also over the top, Campbell and Scrimm have their moments but the wild card is Marta Martin. Her acting is really terrible early on in the film, but slowly gets more tolerable as the film progresses.

Although you'd probably expect more from a film starring legendary horror icons Bruce Campbell and Angus Scrimm, Mindwarp blends the horror, sci-fi, and thriller genres fairly well. The film still has enough cheese injected into it to make it feel like it was made in the eighties; when horror films were at their peak. So while the acting sometimes leaves something to be desired, the concept is surprisingly great and would even go on to influence sci-fi films you're probably more familiar with like The Matrix. Mindwarp is half Mad Max and half The Hills Have Eyes with a little bit of Total Recall thrown in for good measure. This quirky, blood-soaked post-apocalyptic gem is worth unearthing if you're a hardcore fan of horror or sci-fi cinema.",1301097600,3,3604,4.780096308186196
676580,3,6303439756,"I just caught this movie not too long ago and felt compelled to write a review here.  Originally I watched it for Bruce Campbell, the king of current B-movies and cult classics.  I have been a big fan of Bruce Campbell since his Evil Dead days even though his acting skills are limited and his movies outside of the Evil Dead series are subpar; his charisma and personality are the main draw.

Enter Mindwarp.  It is like an early low budget vision of The Matrix where Judy (Marta Alicia) manages to escape her computerized Utopia and enter the harshness of reality.  Well she didn't exactly escape, she rebelled and was kicked out.  Bruce Campbell plays Stover, a wanderer of the ""outworld"" who does all he can to survive, not disimilar to Mad Max.  Their paths cross and they spend some time together in the post apocalyptic wasteland.  To not spoil anything I won't get into the plot any further but will mention that the conflict in the film involves what are called ""crawlers"", a mutated breed of human that cannibilizes human flesh.

Bruce Campbell is not the star of the film but plays a secondary role to Marta Alicia's character.  I have never seen her in a movie before and now I know why, this is her only movie role.  Her acting may not be Oscar worthy but it's certainly better than a lot of what you see on television these days or in a high budget Michael Bay film.  She also happens to be very sexy but in a girl next door sort of way.  She isn't some playmate thrown into the role, she's an athletic, cute and smart actress who I wish I could have seen more of back in the 90's as a teenager.  Bruce Campbell is rather low key in this film and it is obvious this is not one of those B-movies specifically written for him to capitalize on his cult following.  His performance is one the best I have seen from him.  He is believable in his role and helps you ignore the somewhat distracting low budget.  I love Campbell when he is doing comedy but he comes across very well in this film by turning it down a notch.

The film is certainly limited in budget which may distract some but they did a very good job for what they had to work with.  There is plenty of gore in the film which may turn some off but it helps add a horror element to this Dark Science Fiction piece.  Most important is the story and the underlying themes.  You have what is perceived to be Heaven, the virtual world where Judy comes from and what is perceived to be hell, the underground world of where the Crawlers dwell.  Inbetween, where Bruce Campbell lives, is like a sort of purgatory.  What is of particular interest is how Judy feels trapped in her ""heaven"" and yearns to experience true reality while those in that reality dream of being in the virtual paradise where Judy comes from.  Those in Heaven are curious about hell and those in hell are curious about Heaven.  The grass is always greener on the other side.

It's worth a watch, you might like it.  Had this been given a higher budget the themes might have been able to be explored a bit more but as it is, it works well enough as a Dark Sci-Fi horror.",1247356800,2,3107,4.348958333333333
676750,3,6303439756,"This is a must-see for Bruce Campbell fans, and the premise is actually pretty promising. There are some great, weird scenes, and some fun special effects.

However, this has, quite possibly, one of the most drawn-out, poorly executed endings in the history of cinema. After having a relatively brisk pace throughout, the plot SLAMS to a halt after the ""shocking"" surprise is ""uncloaked,"" and we're forced to listen to heavy, slow, philosophical dialogue for what seems like foreeeeever.

So, like I said: Bruce Campbell fans, definitely check it out. Fans of cheesy 90's sci-fi... yes. Everybody else... probably not.",1421971200,3,618,5.232323232323233

It's a very competent little horror/sci-fi film that also features Angus Scrimm who once again chews the scenery with his devilish charm and haunting expressions. I think that most horror buffs should buy this just because it has Angus and Bruce in it but they will be pleasantly surprised to find that this movie is most interesting with a a very original story and nice twist ending with plenty of bloody moments to further cement it as a fun and underrated gem  :),1521504000,,621,4.594594594594595
