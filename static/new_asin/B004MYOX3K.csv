4433904,2,B004MYOX3K,"I'd like to preface this with, I am a Kathy Smith fan, she is down to earth & motivating, without being hyper, or cutesy.  This is a great video if you are already in great shape, like Kathy Smith is. I thought because this video is geared toward the aging crowd it would be suitable for the aging crowd. However, if you have injuries & or limited mobility like myself, this may be a tough video to follow. It is very fast paced. The weight lifting segments do not have modifications presented as an option as described in the product details. For instance, I can not do bent over rows, due to back issues, I was hoping she would provide a modification for this move, but unfortunately does not. I do not consider reducing the amount of weight as a modification or slowing down the move a modification, I would like body placement options as a modification. Core strengthening is mostly crunches on the floor, again, something I am not able to do, not only doctors orders, but physically painful. I am not putting this review up to debate others, I applaud those that can do this workout, I am just disappointed the item description was not what this video turned out to be, and hope to help others make an informed decision.",1307836800,141,1225,4.493273542600897
4433905,5,B004MYOX3K,"I absolutely love my Ageless DVD.  About six months ago I started going to the weight lifting classes at the gym.  They were fun, but most of the people in the class were 10-20 years younger than  I am.  I still feel the competitive need to keep up with the group.  Well after a few weeks, adding more weight, I hurt my back and had to stop for about 3 months.  That's when I started looking for something that I could do at home at my own pace.  Kathy's workout is just what I needed.  I really appreciated the introduction when Kathy talks about how important it is to add weight lifting to your routine.  I was always one that would shy away from them, thinking like everyone else that I didn't want to get big bulky muscles.  Well it's taken a while but I now finally get it and know the importance of keeping my body strong, especially as I get a bit older.  I love the different workouts.  Some days I do them all, but some days, well, its a bit harder to get motivated and doing just one segment still makes me feel good that I did get some exercise that day.  The best part is Kathy.  She is so positive and so motivating.  I really think she enjoys working out and her enthusiasm is contagious.  I'd certainly recommend this video to anyone who is interested in staying healthy and strong.",1307145600,13,1298,4.258196721311475
4433906,5,B004MYOX3K,"I've always been a fan of Kathy Smith, following her through the years as she helped layout each change in health and fitness of her generation. The variety of methods and topics throughout the years helped me stay fit and healthy as I aged. Now, Kathy brings a new attitude on aging. We no longer have to decay as we age. Instead, through strength training and a shift in mindset, aging is an active process, committing to a lifestyle of energy and health. We are no longer defined by our age; Kathy promotes an Ageless lifestyle. Just from the look of Kathy today, I wanted to see this DVD to possibly learn some of her secrets... Can you believe she's turning 60 this year?!

The DVD itself has a great set up for any age or level. With 4 different 15 minute workouts (Arms, Legs, Glutes, and Core), there is always different ways to workout, working as hard as you feel for that day. I like to do 2 of the workouts, switching up each day. On the days I feel particularly strong I'll try to complete 3. To end it all, I usually throw in the bonus stretching segment to help me cool down. There's plenty of content and its all very easy to customize.

The workouts themselves are very energetic and helpful. Kathy's brought her wonderful attitude of course, guiding you through each motion, offering tips to increase or decrease the lower of difficulty if you need to do so. Since the workouts are simple, all you need is a mat(or carpet) and some weights. As you adjust your difficulty level, you can control how heavy the weights you use are (I started with 3lbs, but now have moved up to using 5lbs). The movements themselves aren't overly challenging to accompany any age or difficulty level, but they provide a thorough and complete workout that has me feeling exhausted by in the end, in a good way.

Ageless with Kathy Smith is perfect for me as I want to stay focused on my health and fitness. Its nice to have someone who sees aging as a positive thing that is within our control. And you can never start too young, each day we age our body will decline if we don't pay attention to them. If you're looking for something a little more tuned to your lifestyle, without having to SHRED yourself or go through EXTREME workouts to do so, I definitely recommend picking up Staying Strong.",1304899200,83,2294,4.470167064439141
4433907,5,B004MYOX3K,"Kathy Smith provides a set of short workouts that can be combined together as an individual's need demands. She offers a lively pace, but it is quite adaptable for the beginner or less robust uses. It is a vigorous challenge for any male or female, but as stated it can be adapted easily. For instance, When the pace is faster than I could maintain, I simply did fewer movements, but stuck with the same action. If a particular movement was painful or difficult, as I have a bad left hip, I simple used a lighter movement in that spot. Most of the time, I kept up and worked up a sweat. That's good. The young and healthy user will find this challenging yet fun.

I'm 63 and still recovering from back surgery less than 6 months back. I've also had 2 heart attacks, the last 18 mo. ago. That proves this is a doable routine DVD set for all, but the younger and stronger and fitter people will surely easily maintain the pace that Kathy Smith offers. She is a peppy leader to follow, and her chat keeps the time lively as well. She is extremely encouraging to all participants, always suggesting smaller movements, or alternatives if her actions are too much for the day. Offers challenging add-ons for the very fittest exerciser.

Each of the 4 15-minute segments go quickly. Personally, I combined 2 then followed with the 12 minute stretching segment for a total of 42 minutes a day. A younger person likely could do all 4 segments followed by some stretching. The 4 options of arms, legs, glutes, and core are easily interchangeable and can be used in any order with a click of the remote.

The segments make use of a mat (I used the carpet), weights (Kathy used 5# & 8# while I only used 3#), cans of food also works, and the occasional use of a chair (I just used a dining table chair.) No fancy equipment needed. I was pleased to note that Kathy Smith's routines used basic movements that I was trained to use while having physical rehabilitation therapy after my heart attack and surgery. This is a solid program for strengthening, toning, and muscle building.

An exercise DVD my wife and I have added to our DOABLE routine list. Now if we could just find that ""FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH"" DVD and turn back time about 2 decades. :)
AGELESS with Kathy Smith is right on; any age, any level, very adaptable; and Kathy is such a cute, bubbly, energetic, encourager, on the screen.
Worth the DVD price. If I'd started younger, maybe I could have avoided that expensive operation.",1301788800,182,2475,4.517857142857143

8436328,2,B004MYOX3K,"The title of the DVD, ""Ageless with Kathy Smith"", implies that the workout is geared toward women who are a little older.  My wife (who is in her early 50s) tried this DVD and definitely does not recommend it for people with knee or hip problems.  One would think that since the DVD is targeted toward an older audience, the exercises would be more joint-friendly.  Instead, there are a lot of lunge and squat exercises, which are murder on the knee joints.  The arms and core workout sections are good.  Just be very wary of the leg and glute workouts if your joints are no longer those of a 25-year-old.",1517184000,,605,4.463636363636364
