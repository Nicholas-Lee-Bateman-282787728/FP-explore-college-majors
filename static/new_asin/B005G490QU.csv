4687270,5,B005G490QU,"I saw this on BBCA about a year ago and had to have it for myself so I could show my girlfriend. We both love trying new beer and wine and this DVD series got us more thirsty than ever. She also just came back from a trip to England so it was a nice nostalgia trip for her too. I highly recommend these very entertaining DVDs to anyone who loves beer and wine, top gear, or just wants to learn about something new while laughing the whole time. Great buy!",1379030400,,455,4.010989010989011
4687271,5,B005G490QU,"Oz and James are even better here than on their wine adventures.  I watched part of this on BBC America, but we really needed to own it.",1364083200,,136,4.037037037037037
4687272,5,B005G490QU,James May (and Oz Clark) make this group of DVD's a lot of fun to watch.  And I even learned a bit about wine and wine making.  But mostly it's just a great joy ride through various wine countries with two funny guys (sometimes unintentionally funny).,1360281600,,251,4.434782608695652
4687273,5,B005G490QU,This is probably one of the greatest TV shows I've ever seen.  Brilliant tour of the UK and truly informative whilst still be incredibly entertaining.  You'd be a fool not to buy this.,1330214400,4,184,4.545454545454546
4687274,5,B005G490QU,"I think the producers may have had May and Clarke ham it up a bit but other than that, great program. Very entertaining.",1323302400,2,120,4.260869565217392
8471076,5,B005G490QU,"Service to mankind? Knighthood? Some say not all just talk. Grab a cold one and watch two grown men drink alcohol.

James and Oz need to do another tour because just in the Midwest-region of the US alone... Over very many British-Style Ales are alive and well! Every day another new brew seems to appear and these are waiting our favorite drunken duo to come drink whilst a camera is pointed at them. These are of my favorite buffoons. Video treasure. Drink-formative Brit-tastic.",1486166400,,480,4.783132530120482
8471077,5,B005G490QU,A fun trip around Britain checking out all kinds of booze.,1472860800,,58,4.363636363636363
8471078,4,B005G490QU,James and Oz are a good pair on this adventure.,1467158400,,47,3.8
8471079,5,B005G490QU,I love it!,1465084800,,10,2.6666666666666665
8471080,4,B005G490QU,"James and oz Clarke make a interesting pair that is for sure.
I have always enjoyed James dry humor, and Oz adds his own style of flair to the show.
As far as learning about wine, there is certainly plenty of useful tid bits to pick up from their adventures.
Enjoyed the show thoroughly.",1457654400,,287,4.333333333333333
8471081,5,B005G490QU,What's not to like about a wine guy and a petrol head going around the UK drinking!,1434067200,,83,3.9411764705882355
8471082,5,B005G490QU,"Whats not to like, you get Oz and James wandering around getting drunk trying to find good alcohol.  I really like this series and hope there are more in the future.",1433894400,,165,4.32258064516129
8471083,5,B005G490QU,"Great chemistry between these two TV presenters who love food, drink and Britain.  Fun escapades as the 2 travel across England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales to find the drink that best represents Britain.",1418342400,,201,5.28125
8471084,5,B005G490QU,"One of the funniest shows that I have seen in a long time. Both wine adventures and this one. These guys are the perfect couple (if Mr May ever drops his aversion to hugging). But as a homebrewer myself I strongly disagree with Mr. May: Yes beer is not just a peoples drink anymore which people just drink. Great beers are well worthwhile to philosophize about.
But my biggest question: Will there ever be a 4th season? Maybe great micro brews in the US?",1417651200,,454,4.416666666666667
8471085,5,B005G490QU,"My DH and I thoroughly enjoy this video. For the two of us, it isn't a one and done viewing. We have watched it over and over and still laugh along with James and Oz as they travel through Great Britain (and a little beyond). My only complaint was that as the viewer I couldn't actually taste the ales, whisky and wines!",1390089600,2,320,4.17741935483871
