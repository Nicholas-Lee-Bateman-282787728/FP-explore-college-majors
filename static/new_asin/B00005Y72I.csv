1675505,4,B00005Y72I,"The TARDIS crew land on a giant craft under the Urbankan leader Monarch.  He and his two ministers, Enlightenment and Persuasion, are humanoids with green-brown frog-like complexion.  The Urbankans are going to settle Earth, as their irregular variable sun went nova.  However, as there are three billion Urbankans aboard, wherever they are, and three billion people on Earth, is it possible?  And in a surprise moment, after Tegan provides some sketches of current Earth fashions, Enlightenment and Persuasion turn themselves human, wearing clothes from Tegan's sketch!
Other humans onboard:  Bigon the Athenian philosopher, the Chinese Lin Futu, the Mayan Princess Villagra, and Kukurtji the Australian aborigine, as well as representatives of their tribe.  Bigon's a valuable ally, as he tells them the inside story of Monarch's plan.  However, if Bigon was rescued 100 generations ago, how can he survive for 2,500 years?  The answer comes in the cliffhanger of Episode 2.
I found some of Monarch's intentions disguised as messages that actually hold water.  He tells Adric that they are coming to save the Earthlings.  ""They war amongst themselves.  They make more weapons than food and two-thirds of them are starving.""  I don't know--with the sorry state of the world today, maybe Monarch's grand scheme would be the best for mankind.
The Doctor marvels at the instruments of Monarch's ship in child-like wonder, flicking buttons.  He's even polite to the monopticons, Monarch's black globular monitors, even making a pun:  ""Hello again.  You must be having a ball.""
Adric, not content to showing off--""...in the inner spiral arm of Galaxia Kyklos [Greek for the Milky Way],"" berates the grumpy Tegan, who keeps going on about the TARDIS missed Heathrow Airport and how she'll lose her job.  ""That's the trouble with women--mindless, impatient, and bossy.""  WHOA!  Tegan counters with ""You chauvinist!  I heard that.""  Adric:  ""You were meant to.""  Nyssa, also offended, happens to be reading Alfred North Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and shows Adric the book.  He backs off with, ""You're not a woman... You're a girl.""  Kids, stop fighting now!  And Nyssa, you're just amazing!
Tegan seems to have had a double serving of sour grapes in her breakfast cereal.  When asked how her ancient history is, she answers, ""Like I feel--awful.""  She's so high-strung and eager to get to the TARDIS, I thought, ""Just as well, whiny!  You're no fun anyway.""
Nyssa comes off best of the trio.  She not only tops Adric in scientific knowledge (bioengineering, cybernetics, biology concepts) she's more resourceful, well read, and more able to see the danger Monarch poses than Adric.
Many great lines also abound in this story.  Enlightenment describes the Doctor as ""too jocular, irresponsible.  Such a being prefers mental anarchy.  They call it freedom.""  Me too.  Monarch on Bigon's tendency to doubt: ""the greatest intellectual galvanizer.""  The Doctor teases the impatient Tegan by saying half a quote by Sir Francis Drake:  ""There's time enough to be at Terminal 3 and beat the Armada too.""  Bigon says, ""In a civilized world, there is no substitute for democracy.""  Well, ideally, yes.
Four To Doomsday was the Fifth Doctor's second televised adventure, but the first one made.  Having seen it so late after all the other Peter Davison stories, I was surprised and relieved that this story didn't disappoint.  Davison is really feeling fresh and cheerful here.",1027382400,,3467,5.2101449275362315
1675506,3,B00005Y72I,"Highly underrated, and deservedly so. It's filled with double entedres, OTT acting and dialogue, and unsual theatrical staging. But, that's why I enjoy it. Four to Doomsday is also a very odd piece if Who, even though it's presentation is totally straight forward. I feel this story helps flesh out Adric and Tegan's relationship. And Adric, annoying as he is, is not bad in this serial, still showing his immaturity and impressionability. The design of the spaceship is done very well, giving a feeling of a lot of space.
As said before, this one always seems to get lost in the shuffle. But if you're a non-discriminating Who fan, you might find enjoyment when Tegan can understand the dialect of an Aborigne taken from Earth over 25,000 years ago and believe her draftsman abiltiy, watch silly swordsplay(why is all JNT era swordfighting look like they're rehearsing it?) and Chinese Dragons, then this might be the Who serial for you...",1026172800,,940,4.918238993710692
1675507,3,B00005Y72I,"This show was originally broadcast January 18 1982 and is the second story in the Peter Davison incarnation of the role.
This is a more cerbral story for the Doctor and lays the foundation for a number of similar stories which occur throughout the fifth Doctor period.
As far as the plot goes the Doctor and his travelling companions who always seem to be wearing the same clothes land on a giant ship heading for Earth. They encounter a number of apparent earth people and a being called Monarch who periodically returns to Earth and brings technological progress with him each time.
Nothing is ever so simple and the Doctor unravels the riddle and resolves the situation.
In a way this story establishes more of a rift between the Doctor and each of his companions which had never been found in a Doctor Who story before. It is almost as if someone said 'what would happen if a regenerated Doctor did not like or get on with the companions he inherited?'. Tensions between them mount with Tegan particularly seen as a whingeing nag. The tensions would be ultimately be resolved but that is for a different story.
For many viewers, Tom Baker was the ultimate Doctor Who, and his replacement, the young ex-vet from 'All Creatures Great and Small' did not seem to fit the bill. The switch in emphasis of the stories is clear from the surreal Logopolis and this follows in that tradition. Clearly too, the targeted audience is no longer children but it is not clear who the audience that is being aimed for is.
The slow pace and the nature of the story means that this is not the most popular of the Davison years. On the other hand he had big shoes to fill and no matter what he did it was going to take some time before he made the role his own.",1025308800,2,1745,4.4733542319749215

1675563,5,B00005Y72I,"Some people suggest Doctor Who: Four to Doomsday was not one of Peter Davidson's best episodes but in my humble estimations it did not have to be.  First off I loved Peter Davidson even in this incarnation of our beloved Doctor Who.  However Peter Davidson was helped out by the Monopticans.  The omnipresent hovering supposedly all seeing black eyeballs that followed everyone wherever they went were a blast.  What made the Monopticans truly halarious was the toungue and cheek way the Doctor interacted with them.  Saying things like ""Oh there you are, well come along then!""

I enjoyed the discriptive names of the aliens.  I found Four to Doomsday interesting on many levels.  Being autistic myself I enjoyed that taken so much of the humor in this episode appeared only if you take everything literally.  I enjoyed how the aliens had an almost autistic take on their meeting with The Doctor and his cohorts.  I love how the aliens called the life support technology incumberances.  I love how the aliens dailed up an earth type oxygen atmosphere for his visiting guests as if he were ordering fish and chips at a local take away shoppe!  There was so much to love about Four to Doomsday that I could go on and on about.  the humor in Four to Doomsday was very subtle so its no wonder many might miss it.

Being autistic I get fascinated by the strangest things and for me the true objects that stole my fancy were the monopticans those black roving floating eyeballs.  I have a few top Doctor Who stories I love and this is definitely among my top ten most loved Doctor Who episodes of all time.",1404777600,,1601,4.607773851590106

This craft turns out to be the home of the alien Monarch who visits Earth on a regular basis to study it and collect specimens, and he is of course a threat to all humanity. Neither the Fifth Doctor, nor the new TARDIS team, has grown into their roles, nor come together yet in this episode. Everyone seems to just be running from scene to scene, and their lines don't seem to really be felt as much as just exclaimed. The Monarch isn't a very credible villain, and the best characters seem to be the earthlings previously taken from past visits, everything from ancient people onwards. This episode was from very early in the Fifth Doctor's run, and it really shows. Things get better from this point onwards as he and the TARDIS team begin working together better.",1377302400,,903,4.685534591194968
1675586,5,B00005Y72I,I got this for my husband for Christmas. He was thrilled! We are both total Whovians and have been slowly trading out his old VHS recordings of the original series episodes for DVDs over the last few years. This one has been tough to find so I was very pleased to suprise him with it. We have already seen it and loved it! It now has a permanent place in our ever growing Doctor Who collection.,1357171200,,394,4.197368421052632

1675588,3,B00005Y72I,A good story.  Peter Davidson does his normal excellent job of not exactly knowing what he is going to do until he does it.  Very good support from all the other actors.,1246665600,,169,4.25
1675589,4,B00005Y72I,"Like most classic Doctor Who stories I have seen them all about a dozen times.  ""Four to Doomsday"" is never one that I bring up in conversations about Doctor Who. Regardless of that, each time another DVD comes out from the classic era I scarf it up.

The one thing I liked about this story was that the special effects were a bit above par for the classic series and the sets were awesome.  On the one hand the story is typical Who fodder as it it focuses on a self-centered, patronizing, egotistical frogman called ""Monarch"" who thinks he's God and wants to take over the earth and turn everyone into obedient androids while harvesting earth's minerals for his own evil existence.  It is ingenious in that Monarch has been taking round trips around the universe for eons, snatching up representatives of the human race every few thousand years in the hopes of transplanting them back on earth under his watchful eye.  The Doctor, of course, sees through all of this and saves the day.

The story is important in that not only is it Peter Davison's first taped show (it was broadcast second) but it plants the seeds for the Davison era with his interaction with his companions and elements of action.

Where the DVD falls down is with the extras.  Since I have seen all these stories many times I look forward to the extras.  The extras include about a half-hour of raw video from Davison's first day of shooting, which got a bit redundant, a contempory TV interview with Davison in which he spends more time talking about his role on ""All Creatures Great and Small"" than as the Doctor, and a collection of promotional photographs.  But since 2-Entertain is getting these things out more quickly than Warner Brothers did, they may be spending less time producing the extras.

As a longtime fan of the classic series this is still another fine addition to my collection.",1239840000,8,1870,4.6534954407294835
1675590,4,B00005Y72I,"The Doctor fresh from his rest from his regenration and his escape from the clutches of the Master. Is taking Tegan home so she can catch her flight and go on with her life.

As for the other items in the dvd.  The commentary is rather good with the main cast and the very much in tune with the feel of it.  The clean up of the film is great and you get much of the detail from it.  Also the extras are few but worht it.  On a note that many of the older doctor who stories get digital effets and I thought this one should have gotten it as well but oh well I guess its the older titles they want to improve upon.

1675593,4,B00005Y72I,"Not good enough to get five stars, but still pretty damn good. I think Peter Davison's Doctor was even better in this one than in a lot of his other stories. Don't get me wrong. I liked Davison's Doctor, but in this one in particular, he's just great. Better than in his premiere story. I think the reason why I like him better in this one is because he reminds me of a younger and more energetic Tom Baker. Much as he did in ""Kinda"", ""The Visitation"", ""Earthshock"", and ""The Caves of Androzani"". The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver more in this one, which is a nice thing to see considering that not long from now we won't see it again until the 1996 TV movie. And when they started using it in the new series, they used it way too much.

I haven't seen this one in a while, but that's just because I watched it so much when I first got it on VHS. It is a good one. The story is great. So are all the cliffhangers in it. The special effects are reasonably good, the spaceship was nice looking - both inside and out, lots of excitement, the music was great, and so was the acting. I recommend this one to anyone who has an interest in ""Doctor Who"". Oh, and by the way, Nyssa collapses at the end leaving you hanging. Let me tell you why she collapsed so you won't have to see the next story, which is not yet on DVD. She was just suffering from extreme exhaustion. She'll be fine.",1233878400,11,1382,4.156716417910448

1675615,2,B00005Y72I,"Four to Doomsday was the very first episode that Davison filmed for the series. It was felt that they wanted him to be more at ease in the role when he shot Castrovalva so they mixed things up a bit and shot Four to Doomsday first. Nice idea but F.T.D. is an average Davison adventure at best. Worth getting to complete the collection but that's about it. I myself will be picking it up used as Amazon, in it's wisdom (?) decided to raise the price on the new disc while it sat in my saved section in the cart. Economic times being what they are, I deleted it and the War Machines for the same reason. I guess it really doesn't pay to keep things in the saved section of the cart! They just get more expensive and for a substandard ep like this or War Machines, it's just not even worth full price, ans especially not a raised one.",1233187200,4,831,4.167701863354037
1675616,4,B00005Y72I,"Though many criticize this story as being weak, it isn't that bad compared to what comes, and it is as good or better than many stories before.  While it isn't an exceptional story, it's good, solid serial adventure.  Much of the charm comes from good acting, an unusual story for Who, and excellent direction.  The corny component of repetitive dancing, over acting, and hysterics doesn't hurt it as much as the lack of such elements hurts dull Who stories before or since.  An emotional component is necessary when stories become a ""tale of two rooms"".

I loved seeing this again after 20 years.

The real treat for me was hearing the cast/crew commentary track.  Davison, Waterhouse, Fielding, and Sutton were a very good set of personalities to work together, and you can hear their ease and familiarity in the commentary.  They don't take the show seriously and it provides a warm commentary, similar to an afternoon in Davison's living room with old friends.  I love how these four seem to know so much about the show through all eras, including the recent series.  Though technical commentary is much more satisfying, such amiable commentary is a good second best.  John Black, the director, was on the track, but he was too often set back by the banter of the cast.  Blame throwing never showed up, unlike many commentaries during the Nathan-Turner era.

It's a pity the DVD production didn't include the familiar ""making of"" documentary included with many of the more recent DVDs.",1232755200,,1489,4.861111111111111
1675617,4,B00005Y72I,"Very little has been said about Four To Doomsday. Even the extras on this DVD release are slim. But if you are a fan of the chlostrophopic-trapped inside a spaceship story than Four to Doomsday is for you. In fact you could argue that the real stars of this episode are the sets. There is a nice mix of dark, shadowy hallways and vibrant colors throughout this story. The low, pulsating hum of deep space that permiate the backround noise in Four To Doomsday create an erie edge to this story that never lets up throughout the four episodes.
  As for the stars of the show,Peter Davison is still new to the role at this point and boy does it show. Only his second story Four To Doomsday was actualy filmed first which I belive to be a mistake in hindsight. Davison's performance has that feeling my way around quality to it which should be reserved for the first story of a new doctor. That being said it gives the doctor an extended feeling of ""newness"" left over from Castrovalva. Janet Feilding and Mathew Waterhouse are at thier series lows here. Not realy their fault though as they are forced to spill out mind numbingly dumd lines like, ""Could you pass the sodium chloride please""? and Tegan's ""too right this and too right that"". Sarah Sutton slowly starts to shine in this episode as her character becomes more entangled in the capture's web. An of course there are the Frogs: Monarch, Elightenment , and Persuation. Thank goodness the later two are only seen in frog form for one episode. These were not the worst monsters in the show's history but they certainly were not the best.
  I could ramble on about the rest of the faults with this episode but anyone who reads this review will already be well aware of them. The fact of the matter for me though is that I am glad they released this episode when they did. Most fans of the show probably had this episode pegged as one of the last to be released on DVD (just as it was on VHS). Kudos to the restoration team for dropping this slightly off centered ""GEM"" right in the middle. I have always had a fondness for this story because of it's ""Doctor Who-e-ness"". Cheesey aliens, colorful sets and costums, crazy, non-plausable story arc and dialog that would make william Shakesphere turn in his grave. If I could only have one Peter Davison episode for the rest of my life I would of course take Mawdryn Undead....but if I could have two I would take the little episode that almost could: Four To Doomsday.....Anybody could watch Caves of Andrazani.",1232409600,3,2512,4.5386313465783665
1675618,4,B00005Y72I,"""Four to Doomsday"" enjoys a reputation as one of the weakest of the 5th Doctor stories.  And while I would agree with that assessment, my overall fondness for Davison's portrayal means that it's still a fairly entertaining way of spending 90 minutes.

The Doctor and his full-house of companions, enroute to Heathrow to drop Teagan off at her job, materialize instead of a giant space ship 4 days from Earth.  The ship is populated by 3 frog-like humanoids (2 of which later shape-shift into human-types), plus an assortment  of what appear to be actual humans kidnapped from various times and places on Earth.  The Doctor's attempts to discover exactly what is happening, and save Earth from certain disaster make up the overall plot. Some of the content is pretty laughable (the famous cricket ball manouver, Teagan's bizarre attempts to fly the Tardis to earth and 'warn them' (does she REALLY think she can pilot the Tardis?),  and the 'recreationals' that stop the action dead on a frequent basis. But the acting is fine, (except for that delivered by a certain young male companion who shall remain nameless) the special effects well done (for the time and budget) and all told, it rates about a B- for entertainment value.

The real value on this disc comes in the extras.  I have always loved the commentaries offered by this foursome (Davison/Sutton/Fielding/Waterhouse. They seem to be having a wonderful time, and while Fielding's constant bitching about her hair gets tiresome after half a dozen listens,(she does this on EVERY disc)  the rest is highly entertaining.  Other worthwhile extras include an absolutely fascinating look at a recording session -- we spend 30 minutes watching Davison's very first  studio recording session (not counting the 2 minute change-over in Logopolis, of course), as the Doctor -- and come to understand how it can take several days to record ONE 24 minute episode. (""Can we do that again? Sorry, there was a boom in shot."")  Also entertaining is Davison's appearence on a talkshow, where we learn about his early years in the industry, and watch him make a milkshake.  More expendable extras include a photo-gallery and a very annoying music video of the title sequence.

If you're a fan who buys DVDs just for the main content, this one should probably not be high on your list.  But if you like the extras (I always go to them first thing), this is a must-have.",1231372800,3,2411,4.88943488943489
1675619,3,B00005Y72I,"First let me qualify that I loved the Peter Davison years (1981-84). The potentially disastrous transition from Tom Baker's longest running a 4th incarnation to Davison's Fifth. From the Doctor Who writer Terence Dudley who brought us such 80's plot train wrecks as the Black Orchid and the original Xmas special K9 & Co., we now welcome ""Four to Doomsday"" to DVD.  Dudley's writing is the least of this episode's problems, as it happens this was the first story arc that the ""new"" Doctor would film, although it would follow the excellent season premiere of Castrovalva, it was truly the story Davison would explore how he was intending to portray the character. For this reason, ""Four to Doomsday"" is weaker, but for the very same reason it is worth owning to watch this awkward transition period. For his charter season, Davison's Doctor is very much like William Hartnell's 1st Doctor, not to mention the entourage of companions that both Doctor's were afflicted.  The show's design and effects are quite neat, like the Doctor's spacewalk, the retro-pseudo-science helmets and the Monopitcon camera-critters.

The plot, if you can follow it between the Rave/World Music dance-offs, is something about a frogman Monarch, who has visited Earth 4 times, collecting people to make android replicas to distract him on his millennia-road trips. The Urbankans' leader, Monarch, is aided by his ministers Persuasion and Enlightenment. They are engaged in a overly-complex plan to loot raw materials needed to enable him to travel back in time confirming his belief in his own status as ""creator of the universe."" He intends to poison humanity, allowing him to use his androids as replacements on Earth. The Doctor ultimately uses this poison against the Monarch himself. Ultimately, the baddies plan never becomes clear, in spite of all the exposition.

The episode endings are weaker than the usual fare, the first part wraps with the appearance of android embodiments of companion Tegan's highly proficient ""new wave"" Earthling renderings, surprising, but hardly the point to wrap the show until next week! Counter to ""Who"" cliffhanger tradition, the Doctor actually doesn't any immediate threat until little over an hour in (crazy long by Who standards), and then it gets very BOND as the villain invites them to dine. But as if the apologize for this weakness, the closing moments of the story have Nyssa collapsing upon returning to the TARDIS, a cliffhanger leading to Nyssa being largely absent from the next story arc KINDA.

""Four to Doomsday"" Drinking game...drink each time .....

...the Doctor loses his Companions, Sonic ScrewDriver...his way.

...the dialogue unleashes some amazing double entendres ...like Adric's gem, ""He (The Doctor) knows I'm no good with my hands!"" and several from the Urbankans, like ""How can Earthlings have penetrated us?"" or ""Nyssa, relieve him"" and ""Is this one of your dropping times, Doctor?""

..the dialogue turns to heavy self-referencing exposition like Adric's non-stop rambling about the Timelords, TARDIS and anything else the Urbankans ""Wanted to Know, but Were Afraid to Ask.""

...the cameras cut back to a musical number.

...the action breaks for some Greco-Roman wrestling.",1227398400,7,3225,5.232558139534884
1675620,5,B00005Y72I,"This is one of my favorite Doctor Who stories. This was the first episode filmed with Peter Davison as the 5th Doctor, though it was his second one to be aired. Some of the critques of this story claim that the plot developes too slowly, I don't agree. Its true that apart from the 3rd episode cliff hanger and the last 7-8 minutes of episode four, there are not many action scenes. The first 2 cliff hangers reveal a new major revelation to the plot.

The Story takes place on an Urbankan ship which is led by Monarch. Where the story shines is in the strong roles of the Doctors 3 companions. Adric, Nyssa and Teagan worked together better than any other trio. Each has specific skills, Adric is a genious in math, while Nyssa has a background in biological engineering. Teagan is the only Earthling and is very strong willed, and a bit uncertain about the Doctor. She tends to set out on her own a lot and create a good amount of friction between her and the Doctor as well as Adric. She does not take everyone at face value as many earlier companions who just tagged along did. This helped to give this episode more bite.

Much of the show involves the Doctor and his 3 companions exploring the ship, often times seperate from each other so that by part 3, they all have a different opionion about Monarch's motives. The Doctor has to spend a great deal of time convincing Adric to help him instead of Monarch.

The inside of the Urbankan ship was designed very well and doesn't look that dated even today. The outside of the ship is not as convincing but is adequate and is only shown briefly.

Four leaders from ethnic earth Races are on the ship. Each Ethic group; Chinese, Greece, Australian Aboriginy and Myan, have a dance or entertainment showcased. These dances are well costumed and add even more richness to the splendid backdrop for the story.

Peter Davison plays the Doctor more on a even keel than Tom Baker's eccentric Doctor. One of the 5th Doctors strengths is he spends much more time planning things out and does not rush into action pre-maturely. He also relies more on his companions skills in science and math than did the 4th Doctor.

The first time I watched this episode I thought the ending was paced a bit fast with things wrapped up quickly and not totally explained, this happened commonly in Doctor Who, sometimes due to time constraints. Every show can be nit-picked. One thing I didn't like was when the Doctor went into a trance to conserve oxygen it seemed more like he was hyper-ventilating.
This is an episode that I never tire of watching.",1161043200,,2580,4.537634408602151
1675621,2,B00005Y72I,"This is a bad example of Peter Davison, and unfortunately, is the second(or rather first story as DW was sick and did not have dialogue through Castravalva).  It is also my first impression of this youth.  Although Peter Davison was potentially better than this, I was ruined to him when I saw this story for the first time in '82 or something. This story which is nothing more than a lot of dancing around and silly festival costumes(episodes 3 and 4 are nothing but a dance show and have no content of a story) has no action and little dialogue of any kind and what is there is bland and humorless. It also has little story except for a silly robot dressed like a human or something.  As usual the ""Three Stooges"" as I like to call them, bundle things up for the Doc and are not even funny doing it. When Romana left the show, it just got silly.  Nyssa and Adric pretend to be intellectuals but come off as idiots saying scientific gobledygook.  Adric is always saying(in every story) ""I could make this work, Nyssa."" And and Nyssa comes up with some strange word which she can't even say right, and I am saying ""who cares!"". Tegan is marginally better, and different from the Nyssa/Adric cardboard cutout, but just marginally. She herself is annoying, just not so annoying as the other clowns.  This show is called ""Four to Doomsday"" because the ""Fantastic Four"" from the TARDIS are the heros of the day, however I would have thought of a better title, leaving importance to the Cast of this Story rather than the Doctor and his Compainions.  Perhaps ""Androids of Earth"". ;/",1112918400,3,1577,4.551236749116608
1675622,2,B00005Y72I,"If your a big fan of the Peter Davison years there is a lot better stuff you can get. Only get this if your trying to complete your Peter Davison collection other wise don't get it .
Let me give a rundown of some of the problems. First off I've rarely seen an episode so obviously padded to fill time. There are alot of people just walking around in what looks to be an attempt to show movement so you won't notice nothing or very little is happening plot wise. There are the various cultural dances and displays they keep showing again and again and again in an attempt to have you not notice how slow the plot is going. Here is what I think happened Four till Doomsday had enough plot for two episodes the director do too format needed four episodes thus the endless walking around and cultural displays.
Other problems Adric is annoying you know the only Doctor Who's I have seen in years are the ones I own. And I have Adric only in the E-Space trillogy, I thought he did rather well in that and was suprised to read so many people thought he was annoying, all I can say is now I understand. Tegan acts like a panicky idiot the whole episode in a attempt to rachet up the tension. Nyssa she doesn't seem to have much to do.
In conclusion of the Peter Davison Doctor Who's I own I would highly recommend, Terminus,The Five Doctors, Resurrection of the Daleks and The Caves of Androzani. You can do a lot better than Four Till Doomsday, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that for all it's problems it's more enjoyable than not but only barely. This is weak tea people.",1077321600,3,1590,4.285714285714286
1675623,5,B00005Y72I,"I absolutely love this story. Tegan is a great companion, showing off those natural human traits many of us really tend to have. Poor Adric hadn't had decent writing since he was with Tom Baker's Doctor, and that is when Matthew Waterhouse showed great potential as Adric. Then everything changes, two girls come aboard and the Doctor regenerates. This is actually the first story to be taped (as the hair on everybody is much shorter) People say Tegan overreacted when she stole the TARDIS and was able to fly it out of the ship. But she wanted to warn Earth what was going to happen. Of course something happens to Nyssa and she always has to be rescued, this is why she isn't part of the next episode, Kinda. Adric's chauvinist remark and Tegans reaction, wonderfully acted out by Janet Fielding, was great. You could feel the tension between those two the most, and Nyssa did feel a bit upset as well, but being a more boring character than the high-strung Tegan, she doesn't say much. Peter Davison is one of the best as the Doctor, and it's great to see him in a more serious role than a drunk young vet in All Creatures Great and Small.",1054252800,2,1143,4.5

7956796,4,B00005Y72I,"Very good story line, but I thought Fielding's role was a little over the top. Sutton was good and Waterhouse was once again in over his head.",1494201600,,142,4.296296296296297

7956798,5,B00005Y72I,"Peter Davison had a huge task ahead of him taking over the role of the Doctor after Tom Baker filled the roll so well for seven years.  He was younger than his predecessor but had a different personality which is usually the way a new actor is brought into the role.  This episode was the third to air but was actually Peter Davison's first shot story in the role.  First time can be a little awkward as the actor is learning the character but Peter was solid to begin with and found some humor in the later part of his stint in the role.  I found this an enjoyable story, but certainly not the epic that Earthshock was.  Info text is always turned on when I watch to learn a little more about happenings of the time.",1480809600,,717,4.204379562043796

7956800,3,B00005Y72I,"Four to Doomsday is actually the first story Peter Davison filmed and it's a production that has some big problems: wooden guest acting, an unconvincing villain, and probably one of the most absurd portrayal of physics in all of Doctor Who. However, there's a godo mystery through the first two parts and it's good to see the Fifth Doctor get direct with Adric in a way he rarely did, and the resolution is fairly satisfying. As a whole, the story isn't dull or stupid, but it does have a camp feel that may actually make it more enjoyable for some fans.",1463011200,,554,4.4950495049504955
7956801,5,B00005Y72I,"A great one-off villain, great story, great character moments, and just enough creepiness that you want to watch the next episode as soon as the previous one ends.  I heard in an interview with Peter Davison that he filmed this before doing the Castrovalva story, so this is really his first acting as The Doctor.",1439337600,,313,4.6909090909090905
