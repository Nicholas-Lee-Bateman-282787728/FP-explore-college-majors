8196038,3,B000QFCD9A,"There are 4 DVDs, each with a single 1 hr episode. There is simply NO reason to do that except to try and justify charging a premium for this set. This only needed to be a 2 DVD set at half the price.",1397001600,,200,3.6744186046511627
8196039,5,B000QFCD9A,"This video is slow but the information that is presented is interesting especially the dvd entitled - Deadly Skys -it explains how objects such as meteors are passing close to earth and that its only a matter of time when we get hit  by the big one

their anology is we are in a cosmic shooting galley.

It shows the meteor that fell to earth in 1992 -this was captured on several video cameras and it is shown on this dvd -this dvd alone is worth the price of this set.",1342224000,,470,4.142857142857143
8196040,5,B000QFCD9A,"This is a PBS box set that came out around 1998. While the series is presented in a format that is more commonly found today, the shows are presented in a serious and thought provoking manner. Stacy Keach narrates a series of stories arranged by topic. While you may have heard of some of the stories before, they are presented in a more in-depth feature than many shows do presently. Some you may not have heard of at all. They are no less engrossing. Let me point out that this is not a disaster of the week type of clip show with short segments, it is similar to the History Channel's Wrath of God series about one in a life time disasters and how people were affected. The set includes:

EXTREMES: This set focuses on weather extremes on our planet; a man survives 2 avalanches in Utah, how rescue teams work (95% of avalanches are triggered by men with above average snow skills), management science of avalanche districts in Utah and Washington (forerunners of Discovery Channel shows about this topic), a French avalanche disaster in 1999, a 1910 train caught in an avalanche in Stevens Pass Washington; Heat extremes in Death Valley, CA (a precursor to shows like Discovery Channel's Raging Planet and History Channel's How the Earth Was Made), explaining geologic formations of how the region was made.

VOLCANIC KILLERS: Exploring Lake Nyos in West Africa (where carbon dioxide killed an entire village (see the National Geographic specials about the Killer Lake, that delves more deeply into this subject), 1,700 people died, Lake Kawa Ijan in Indonesia has poison gases, yet miners dig for sulfur with no protective gear for $2 a day to feed their families (this story was also featured in the more recent Human Planet on Discovery Channel), New Zealand's Tangiway disaster where a volcanic lake collapsed and overturned a train; Lahars (deadly mixture of pulverized rock, mud & water) destroy terrain and kill many at Mt. Saint Helen's in 1980, Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines (this has happened repeatedly, destroying 19 of 21 villages during a rainy season) along with floods. This is a heartbreaking episode as many villagers refuse to leave their homes, even after losing family members.

STORMS OF THE CENTURY: Cyclones- a little know March 12, 1993 storm killed more people than Hurricanes Hugo & Andrew combined - harrowing stories of Florida residents who braved land and sea disasters, the storm moved on to the Smoky Mountains where some teens on a survival trip with little provisions were hit by a very heavy blizzard in TN, prompting (at that time) the largest peacetime search and rescue attempt in US history, clouds covered over 200 miles that reached Nova Scotia, where a dramatic rescue attempt ended in tragedy, (not the perfect storm of 1991); the story of a 1953 UK & Holland storm disaster that was the UK's worst post war tragedy-1835 died in Holland when the dykes failed, over 2000 in the UK were lost. This is the most emotional episode of this box set.

DEADLY SKIES: Stories about the atmosphere including; lightning's deadly effects (a forerunner of Discovery Channel's Raging Planet series), scientists shoot rockets to gage phenomena, stories of people hit by lightning, NASA's ongoing battle with lightning in Florida, an Australian storm brings disastrous hail, and the damaging effects of space debris and meteors.

This set included many emotional tales and interesting facts. If you enjoy a more storied approach, this set is for you. Once again it is not a set of short disaster clips with some narration added. I think you will enjoy hearing about some little known events that many other shows have not featured.",1332547200,6,3664,4.912762520193861
8196041,5,B000QFCD9A,"Stacy Keech is great as the narrator for this series. Topical and not an extensive nor exhaustive delving into the subject matter it remains highly entertaining. (Even if sometimes the ""doom awaits"" tone is a bit overplayed.)

Readily accessable to most from grade-school age on up. Nice family enterainment.",1302912000,2,308,5.285714285714286
8196042,4,B000QFCD9A,"I loved this set! Edge of your seat weather excitement with enough facts to broaden your understanding of what you are seeing. If you liked Storm Stories, get this set. I also own much of D. Attenborough, but it's like apples to oranges to compare them. I would think that the title Savage Planet and individual dvd titles such as 'Deadly Skies' would be a hint.",1270339200,,362,4.5

  It was greatly inferior to those.  Perhaps I am spoiled.
  Good for a not to deep overview of storms volcanos etc.",1190851200,,377,7.674418604651163
