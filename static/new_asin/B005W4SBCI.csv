8487833,2,B005W4SBCI,"This is great relatively unknown film, a sophisticated comedy with great direction and performances, but the images on this dvd are fuzzy and unclear, not taken from the existing archival copies. I confess it is better than not seeing this film at all,  and I kept it, but regret its poor condition.",1489017600,,299,4.75
