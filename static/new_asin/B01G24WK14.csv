Let me say that when these arrived I was SUPER excited but once I started watching I realized I should have done better research into what exactly I was getting. The bulk of the footage is in-between clips of the hosts talking on stage during the live showing of clips. They then talk OVER the small clips that they actually do play. If you choose to watch the DVDs without their commentary it is literally the same thing except someone set the in-between clips and voiceover parts to mute. I'm not joking. It will play exactly the same with all the parts of them talking on stage, except it is now muted.

I was really disappointed in how short the clips are. I wanted a galaxy adventure of cringe and instead I got a guided  tour of the moments THEY thought were funny in clips of 2 - 3 minutes in length.",1491264000,2,971,4.329670329670329
