7894587,3,6305793867,"This flick was produced 1985,,,but the Wu Tang Clan DVD transfer is extremely, unbelievably and remarkably crappy.

Elton Chong performed brilliantly in this flick,,however, I'm not sure why they called this ""Shaolin Drunken Monkey"", since there's like no drunken monkey styles in it period. The fight scenes were greatly choreographed. This flick was interesting to watch from start to finished. I would definatly recommend it, but the copy I purchased was my worse experience. Therefore, this flick being a 4 star movie recieved only 3 stars

from me!!",1151712000,,554,5.284090909090909

7894589,5,6305793867,"This is a funny movie.  I think the humor is at least partially intentional.  The music is funny, the main characters are funny, the odd translations are funny, the shoe slaps are funny, the guy who bites a chicken's head off is funny, the guy who blows fire is funny, the mirrors on the guys chest are funny and ridiculous, the fan that flies and sound like a ufo is unexplicably funny.  I love the whistling theme music.  It has it all.  It follows the typical kung fu theme, guy wants to fight, finds teacher who teaches him to be humble and then to fight, he trains, he meets a girl, he beats the bad guy, all is well.",1132012800,,622,4.19327731092437
7894590,4,6305793867,"The Shaolin Drunk Monkey is a good kung-fu flic. I first watched it over at a friends house a few years back, I wasn't sure if I liked it at the time but I ended up buying it a couple of years later and I really enjoy it. It has some cheesey music and it does get alittle slow at times but for the most part it's pretty action packed and will keep you ethier laughing or cheering either way.",1107129600,,391,3.9
7894591,1,6305793867,"I have seen this movie and quite frankly I am extremely disappointed because there is absolutely no drunken monkey or even regular monkey boxing seen anywhere in this movie. I am a dedicated fan of Tai Shing Pek Kwar (i.e. Monkey Kung Fu) and so when I came across this movie I just had to buy it because I thought it had the drunken monkey technique but alas, that was not the case. Am extremely disappointed by this.",1090108800,3,418,4.371794871794871
7894592,2,6305793867,"A man named the Silver Eagle goes around fighting and killing off other kung-fu ""masters"" so he can become the best.  Eventually he kills the Shaolin Temple master, whose granddaughter and son (Mo) then try to take their revenge.  Mo meets an old beggar who teaches him to fight and who also teaches him humility.  Finally the beggar, the granddaughter, and Mo join together to do battle with the Silver Eagle.
  The fight scenes are okay, but this movie has nothing to do with the drunken monkey style, monkey style, or even drunken fist/boxing style.  I repeat, those styles are NOT in this movie, although (regular) monkey may be alluded to in a few scenes.  Personally, I got the movie because I'm interested in kung fu styles and drunken monkey is not in a lot of movies, so I was pretty disappointed when I watched the movie and found out it wasn't there.",1036195200,4,861,4.588235294117647
7894593,3,6305793867,"Elton Chong is great in this story of revenge and honor.  Chong plays a young man taken in by a Kung fu master after his family was killed.  Unable to learn kung fu due to the masters orders he is left to do the cleaning and cooking.  Harrassed by the other students he tries to learn kung fu in secret but is found out and sent away for punishment.  While away his school is attacked by the ""Silver Eagle"" (Han Ying) and his band of Lackey's.  On return from his punishment he finds his master dead, and all the students dead aswell.  In fear he runs away and tries to keep a low profile while at the same time trying to find the men responsible.  Due to pure chance he encounters a man who is skilled in the Arts of Shaolin Monkey kung fu.  After countless acts of begging the old man finally takes Chong as a student, puting him through rigurous, almost torturious training routines. Finally after some time he feels ready, and him and his teacher journey out to find the Deadly ""Silver Eagle.""  Finally the 3 men meat in what becomes a spectacular display of martial arts.  One of the most memorable end fights.  the ""Silver Eagle"" is top notch as he takes on the two heroes.  Who's kung fu is superior?  At first I didnt' think this was as good as I do now, but i've seen the light.",965088000,8,1287,4.246913580246914
