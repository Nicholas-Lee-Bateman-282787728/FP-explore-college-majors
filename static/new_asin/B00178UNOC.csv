8265418,5,B00178UNOC,"What a CLASSIC anime I grew up on and owned a few times in my past years. Problem!? I couldn't find it anywhere. No store. No Digital. Let's try Amazon. Boom! Of course they have it! The DVD came in a pretty time efficient manner, plus it was in great condition. Absolutely ZERO complaints here. The movie still a semi-slept on classic anime movie.
