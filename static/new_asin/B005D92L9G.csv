8466420,5,B005D92L9G,"They really don't make them this good anymore.  Little bear combines good storytelling with a pinch of whimsy.  The characters have real conversations using real words unlike so many insipid modern cartoons. Instead of ""were going to use our imaginations today kids!!"" the creators  depict a young bear with a vivid imagination of his own, inspiring imaginative play without ever using the word. Little bear is one of few kids shows I don't hesitate to allow my children to watch, as there is never any questionable content or (passive) aggressive behaviour to emulate. It is really sweet to hear my kids repeating and re-enacting the shows on their own, they absolutely love it.",1456272000,,679,4.991150442477876

8466422,5,B005D92L9G,"I have 3 little girls, and any busy mom knows there are times you just have to put them in front of the TV. Little Bear is, by far, the sweetest, calmest, least annoying-sounding cartoon we've experienced. The characters are precious, the background music is pleasant, and there's lots of fodder for the imagination. My kids--and both parents--love this show.
PS- She won't admit it, but my 9-year-old can still be captured under Little Bear's spell.",1452470400,,450,4.934210526315789

8466425,4,B005D92L9G,"My children (4 and 2 YO) enjoy watching this DVD when they're tired or calming down for the night (or nap). If I want them to sit still and thoroughly enjoy what they're watching though, this is not the DVD to do that. What I mean is, they have to be tired or settling down in order for this DVD to keep their attention. If they're wide awake and ready for fun, this is not the best option.
Personally, I think Little Bear is cute.",1427241600,,431,4.08235294117647
8466426,5,B005D92L9G,"We are beyond happy with this dvd. The selected stories are wonderful, and they keep my child calm. They don't encourage hyper activity. It is lengthy, a lus while I am cleaning. My son does not get a lot of TV time. When he does, I feel safe letting him watch Little Bear.",1426204800,,273,4.169811320754717
