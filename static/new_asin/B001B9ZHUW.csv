Simone has been at one of the top Brazilian singers for years. Her style is called MPB (Brazilian Popular Music, although she also has in her repertoire a number of great sambas. MPB is uses suave and romantic melody, typical from Brazil, where the music lyrics are real poetry.

Zelia is not new in the music scene either, and although she has less time on the road, her voice, compositions and style really complements Simones'.

They play with a large band and the show is really great to watch and hear!",1261353600,,598,4.36936936936937
