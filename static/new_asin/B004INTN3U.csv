This last one was just awful. The animation is new, the characters have totally new personalities, very grown up themed...not the same show at all. I think they had a nice awkward show the first two rounds, tried too hard and failed. Did I mention there are no giants?

So if you want your kid thinking about crushes and such (the characters are 7), learning to use boys like doormats, asking who lady gaga is, and why the fda would put painkillers in our cereal, then by all means...watch it.",1458604800,2,748,4.533333333333333

We parents liked this one too! Funny!  They need to MAKE MORE and put them all on one disc though!",1378166400,,235,4.222222222222222
8430980,2,B004INTN3U,"Our family have enjoyed the first two DVD's from the Junior's Giants collection and purchased this one for our six year old son.  My husband and I were a little disappointed in that they introduced girlfriend / boyfriend material  which up till now hasn't been included in the series.  Nikko professes his feelings to Cecila which she in response takes advantage of to manipulate him to be her personal servant.  Loved the other two, but this one I won't be recommending for those with youngsters.",1376697600,3,497,4.811764705882353
8430981,5,B004INTN3U,"Excellent DVD. We've added this DVD to our son's Junior Giants collection. He loves the entire collection.
He sings along to the songs and watches it over and over.",1356652800,,164,4.689655172413793
8430982,4,B004INTN3U,"I love the Juniors Giants series--and so do my kids (young and old).  They make all of us laugh, and the message is always clear and right on target.",1335398400,,149,4.137931034482759
