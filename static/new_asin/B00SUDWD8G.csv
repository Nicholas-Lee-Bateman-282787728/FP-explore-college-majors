8699332,1,B00SUDWD8G,"It was bad in so many ways. One way in which it was bad is that there is absolutely no character development. We neither know any of the characters and therefore don't care what happens to them. We don't understand who these subjects are, who the authority figures are, what is the nature of the threat to Earth, what were the monster thingys. To much video disturbance jump scares - lazy writing and lazy making a movie. The director, and I guess all involved, made no effort, whatsoever, to get the audience to care and/or invest in this (for lack of a better term) story.",1527379200,,574,4.476190476190476
8699333,1,B00SUDWD8G,"This one is a very fragile idea, with a seemingly complicated plot that could be executed phenomenally.

This film failed miserably.

Using the framing device of a cable news expose', we're told of a CIA program using people with psychic abilities of some sort being teleported to alternate ""planes of existence"" to stop evil inhuman creatures from trying to invade our plane of existence. We follow a mission that ended in abysmal failure and led to the entire program's cancellation, via camera footage taken by the psychic teens themselves and in the facility from the handlers.

Right away the first failing of the film is how it actually handles the alternate planes of existence and how to put the people in them. They don't do anything original or interesting; the teens go to sleep with electrodes on their head, and basically ""dream"" everything.

Almost to a person, the acting is among the absolute worst I've ever seen, even reaching the level of middle schoolers sight-reading Shakespeare in first year English. EVERYONE is at their absolute worst, delivering lines like they're reading them for the first time ever and essentially guessing as to the context or tone of them.

there are two of CIA handlers voices, Alpha and Delta. The voice of Delta is literally someone putting on the most cartoonishly over the top ""redneck"" accent they can muster while still sounding serious, and Alpha sounds like a 15 year old reading lines from an NPC in a poorly written RPG game.

Speaking of NPCs in poorly written RPG games, at one point for seemingly no reason at all, we get an audio clip of a ""resident mortician"" from the alternate plane, and to call what he did ""acting"" is to call smeared fish guts baked into concrete by the sun ""gourmet sushi"".

Apparently drawing their inspiration from Vincent Price, they give a painfully bland monologue describing some manner of creature eating corpses in a funeral home with the sort of purple prose of a drunken teenager mockingly imitating Edgar Allen Poe. It is the epitome of every bad ""creepy sinister old man"" NPC voice in every poorly written computer RPG voiced by one of the production assistants with no acting experience at all.

Virtually every aspect of this short, short film is an abject failure. The story is incoherent and constantly interrupted by Beavis and Butthead (Alpha and Delta) droning moronically like pubescent teenagers trying to scare children with deep, ultra serious voices. All the video footage is heavily grained and distorted, the CG effects for the monsters literally look like they were made in MS Paint, and the sound mixing is some of the absolute worst of any movie I've ever heard, with some characters sounding like they have microphones, and others not. Some lines are barely audible, then other lines, usually curse words, are ear-splittingly loud, sometimes in the same sentence.

Nothing in this film went right. The writing, the acting, the visual effects, even the most basic stuff like sound. All of it failed abysmally, to such a colossal degree that, seeing positive reviews of this film on other sites, praising the visual effects, of all things, genuinely makes me think those reviews are planted by the filmmakers. And I have almost never come across a movie review I have suspected of being a fake.",1517702400,,3308,4.913978494623656
8699334,2,B00SUDWD8G,"I liked the story , but it was layed out terribly. too much static , not scary , not a thriller , only got to 10min.",1508544000,,116,3.5
8699335,3,B00SUDWD8G,"The manner in which it is filmed, with all the flickering and flashing which I suppose is to set the stage, didn't do anything for me but give me a headache.  It made it very difficult to watch.  With that said, from the beginning of the film it was an easy guess as to the fate of the main characters.  There were a few surprises in route to their fate, though.  For the Found Footage genre, it wasn't bad and I liked the originality of the story and the whole concept.  The acting wasn't bad, either.  It was just overdone flickering, flashing, and scrambled footage that kept me from rating at four stars.  It was just too much.  It happened in nearly every scene.  I can understand using it for dramatic effect, but it was just too much of a good thing.  I need to go take some Tylenol now.",1506556800,,794,4.233333333333333
8699336,1,B00SUDWD8G,"I really wanted it to start making sense.  The premise is interesting, but it never rose to any real sense of dread or concern for the characters.  No pathos.

The camera work was bad, even for something in the FF genre.  It's super annoying when you know that the group is heading towards something, but the person whose POV is showing has his back to it.  I understand why it would be done that way, but it just didn't work here.",1505433600,,431,4.271604938271605

8699338,1,B00SUDWD8G,"I could not even finish this movie. I love bad, low-budget B-movies, but this isn't even up to that quality. The idea was original and should have been a easy win, but the production quality, sound (like it was literally hard to hear most of the dialogue), and acting were horrible.",1505088000,,282,4.549019607843137
8699339,4,B00SUDWD8G,"A quick-little film that brings the viewer straight to the point. No beating around the bush on this one like in so many other horror films that try to be to artsy. Nocturne Six has a special type of creature in there for us horror nuts, one that I will always remember, maybe too much for my own good. I have watched this movie several times already and find I pick up on small things that I did not the very first or second time. Definitely not worth a two star as this film falls into such categories for myself as one of those unusual horrors that will allow you to always remember that one type of creature.",1468281600,2,612,4.194915254237288
8699340,4,B00SUDWD8G,"Although low-budget in scale, this horror flick was actually pretty effective. There are some decent scares in here and the production quality is impressive. A nice twist on the found-footage sci-fi genre, and a cool way to spend a dark and stormy night. Definitely worth a look!",1460505600,2,279,4.957446808510638
8699341,1,B00SUDWD8G,"Was poorly directed, acted, and besides some outdoor sets, most looked terribly put together.  (Let's put a conference table in one room and bare mattresses in empty rooms and then we gave up kind of vibe). This film made me angry for its lack of effort and realization..falls real flat!!",1442361600,3,288,4.76
