7898057,2,6305911657,"2000 (NOT 2013)  Blaxploitation genre no budget video, bad acting. Somewhat violent crime film, certainly NOT ""romance"" as slotted by Amazon. Music is great if you skip the dialog.",1483574400,,180,5.206896551724138
7898058,1,6305911657,"Mickey and Sonya rob a bank with the assistance of two other girls. Two of them are killed, But the cops make a mistake and think that three of them died instead. Now, They're after only one suspect. Sonya sets Mickey up to take the fall for the crime and years after she gets out of prison, Mickey goes looking for revenge against her former friend. This is too bad to be true. The guns look very unreal, There's no gunfire to be seen when the guns are fired, And there's no sound effects to be heard when people are hit. Not to mention, The acting is very atrocious and the action scenes in this movie are piss poor. All copies of this movie need to be buried somewhere and never dug up. Definitely not worth viewing under any circumstances. Hope this review helped, And you can bet, That i'm out.",1135641600,6,799,4.298013245033113
7898059,1,6305911657,"I agree with Rickie Burney it looked an alright movie but I aint at all. Its supposedly about renegade women but their guns look like ray guns but painted black. The acting is one of the worse Ive seen for a York Entertainment film, people get shot then they drop to the floor after a period of time u can hear the caps of the guns go off. When they hold up the restaurant its just chaos.
BEWARE Stay away from this title",1033862400,,421,4.0843373493975905

  The plot, which is another con of the movie, is about two New York women named Mickey and Sonya you plan to rob a bank with two recruits.  They rob the bank successfully, but not without two killed and another injured. Mickey and Sonya, the only survivors, head back home for sanctuary. The two make the perfect getaway, but little does Mickey know that Sonya plots to double-cross her. Sonya gets away while Mickey serves time in prison.  Sonya will soon realize that Mickey will be back to get payback, leading to a final showdown.
  Seems as if it is a good movie, but trust me when I say that it isn't.  The acting is horrible and they put no emotion into their lines. At times, they try to tell jokes, but they are not funny at all due to the flatness of their voice.
  The bank robberies are not action packed or suspenseful at all.  The guns look like they came from the toy store and they sound more like a cap gun than a real gun. The police squad seems unconvincing and there were only four officers.  None of them were in uniform and they were driving in a regular car. Now this is a sign of amateurish work.  During the robbery only one car showed up to catch the four. Normally, the bank is surrounded by cops. This is another sign of an amateurish work.
  So in conclusion, I suggest you don't rent or buy this. This will be a waste of your 90 minutes. The only way you will want to see this is if you are a fan of cheap, tedious, and unrealistic urban action flicks.",995932800,3,1697,4.229813664596273
