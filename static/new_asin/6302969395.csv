532475,5,6302969395,"There is so much to recommend in ""Spirit of the Beehive"" that it is hard for a reviewer to know where to begin.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the cinematography and the performance delivered by the lead actress are among the best ever filmed.  I also enjoyed the musical score, which was largely delivered with a single woodwind, but its simplicity only enhanced its impact.  Some viewers may find it difficult to watch in part because of its almost oppressive atmosphere and in part because little is overtly explained about the characters or their situation.  The latter is because it is a portrayal of life under the rule of Franco, filmed in 1973 while Franco was still alive.  The vaugeness helped keep the censors from blacklisting the film, but it looses none of its power despite its caution.  In watching this film, one is drawn into the lonely plight of the main character, and its only through great effort that a viewer can keep from reaching out to hold her.  Descriptions cannot do it justice, however.  I can only recommned that you see it, and then only when you are in a mood where your mind can be open and your heart needs touching.",1009152000,19,1159,4.619512195121951
532476,2,6302969395,"I viewed this movie in my Honors Spanish III class and was incredibly disturbed by this movie.  The whole entire time that I watched it, I was creeped out and felt very eerie.  I do think, however, that the movie did a wonderful job in portraying just how violent and horrific Franco's Spain was at the time of the Spanish Civil War and the effects that it had the Spaniards.  This movie was full of symbolism and deep meanings that I knew were there, but couldn't quite understand, but that is probably because I'm only 16 years old and not able to comprehend some of lives' truths very deeply.  Though the cinematography and acting was EXCELLENT, the movie as a whole left me feeling very unsettled and disturbed.",990576000,15,715,4.5625
532477,5,6302969395,"The other reviewers have prety much covered the angles to this story so there is not much to add. I'd just like to center on Anna. Both child actresses are very good but Anna Torrent is unforgetable. The capturing of the imagination of two children is a profound piece of work as accomplished by the director. Take a look at the cover of little Anna, those eyes , once you've seen the movie Anna will be with you forever, and that is a good thing. We remember the innocence of youth and most of us would love to capture the essence of that purity. A conscienceness that is unpolluted. Such was the case with Anna until she sees a haunting image that moves her so as to seek  in her own imagination that image that so impressed her. As adults we do the same. The images burned in our conscienceness is what possess us to seek everything we desire. Just like little Anna we imagine what we want. The movie is very good and unique. When Anna whispers to her sister on screen you want to whisper back to her, I love you Anna. I left this movie on after viewing it wondering what ever became of Anna Torrent. I can still hear Anna whispering her innocent questions. I still wonder about Anna, I wonder if she maintained her childhood innocence, I can still here her whispering, she is burned forever in my mind. You go away from the movie remembering your own childhood, and it seems so long ago, until you here Anna whispering that it wasn't that long ago when questions in the dark were part of going to bed. Thanks for the memories Anna. I think young children, those not impressioned yet, would really like this story. Highly recommended for those young at heart, who remember or want to remember their youth. It transcends language barriers, a parent can read the dialogue but a child knows.",982627200,12,1791,4.443768996960486

532479,5,6302969395,"In Castile on the eve of the Second World War a traveling show brings a movie to town. Ana Torrent plays a little girl (also named Ana) who sees Boris Karloff's ""Frankenstein"" and is convinced the monster is real.  She ends up befriending a wounded fugitive, believing him to be the monster.  Victor Erice's haunting film is obviously a political statement on life in Spain during Franco's reign, but it functions even better as testimony to the power of a child's imagination and the fatal loss of innocence that invariable comes to us all.  Not a film for children, who will neither recognize nor appreciate the warning, but for those of us who will always cherish the children we once were, and the world in which we wanted to live.  ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" is a film to treasure forever.",977961600,7,795,4.617021276595745

Hope I haven't made this  sound too dreary -- this is one of the most transcendent film experiences  you are ever likely to have & I don't think there's another film I know  that I can recommend to absolutely ANYONE as wholeheartedly.

532539,5,6302969395,A beautifully filmed heartwarming story set in Post War Spain. When a young child's curiosity is nurtured by an older siblings imaginative tales the results are a damaging encounter scaring the younger child forever. A sensitively crafted film embracing the lonelyness of a small community with just enough space to satisfy an innocent curiosity in an unanticipated manner.

532540,4,6302969395,"Many people comment on the religious or political focus of the film. I was most interested in the way the family is portrayed through the lens of the children. All the emotions one feels while watching the family seem magnified and somewhat mysterious, much in the way a real child might experience their own family, especially in confusing times, or in times of distress. Ana finds a photograph of her mother where someone has written, ""to my dear misanthrope."" The mother writes to an old lover, suggesting that their ability to truly feel may be disappearing just like everyone else. The father keeps strange hours, brewing something unidentified alone in his office, pacing the floor, writing quickly. He stares at everything intensely, but with a faraway, somewhat cold look.

On my second viewing, I was disturbed to find themes of child abuse. The little girl's father reminds them after mushroom hunting they ""must not tell their mother."" The meaning is unclear. He is promising to take them to a mountain with many mushrooms. This could be a reward for keeping a promise, or simply that he does not want the mother to know they went there. When Ana's sister plays hurt, Ana whispers to her, ""It's ok, he's gone now."" Since there is only one male character in the house, I assume she is reassuring her sister that their father is gone. The father also has a mainly loveless relationship with his wife. He stands over her in bed once while she is fake sleeping (implications here are unclear too).

I tried to find other's views on this more family drama orientated take of the film, but had trouble finding ones.

I can see this being a film that increases the viewer's understanding each time it is watched. It's true that the images stay with you for a long period after.",1401321600,,1781,4.720257234726688

One of the few videos in my collection that received a critics' rating of 100 from Rotten Tomatoes.  Don't expect fast action or gunfights, even though it's set during the Spanish Civil War.  A deliberative pace, gorgeous cinematography, will make you wish you could see it on a big screen (maybe you can, with Blu-ray and a room-sized monitor).

532581,5,6302969395,"It is amazing what ""Spirit of the Beehive"" accomplishes merely with the power of suggestion.  Start with the colors: this film is a wonderful example of the use of a restricted palette.  Everything in the Castilian landscape and the village is subdued, austere, yet warm---all tans, ochres, and muted reds.

The film is set in Spain in 1940, at the tail end of the Spanish Civil War, but all that is entirely peripheral to the story.  There is a family of four: Fernando, Teresa, Isabel, and Ana.  There is a hint that something may be amiss in the marraige of Fernando and Teresa.  But the two small girls, Isabel and Ana, are a tight pair that share secrets and fantasies.  They are also quite free to explore their impulses; they set off unaccompanied by adults, their tiny figures poignant and vulnerable with red matching schoolbags.

Older sister Isabel likes to tease young Ana by playing on her imagination and provoking her fears.  After the two girls have seen a screening of the film ""Frankenstein"" in the local town hall, Isabel tells Ana that the spirit of the dead monster can still be summoned by soft whispers.  The two sisters enlarge the fantasy by visiting an abandoned, tomb-like sheepfold set beside a dank, old well.

Later, a young Republican soldier plummets from a train and finds temporary shelter in the sheepfold.  Ana, in her suggestive state, believes that he is a spirit that has come to her, and she brings him a coat and a watch.  After the soldier is killed by fascists, Ana runs away from home and towards her fantasy world, spending a night alone in the wilderness before being rescued.

This film has a few pagan images-- a black cat, girls jumping over bonfires--balanced against the religious icons and paintings of the family home.  It is a movie about endangered innocence, but the danger always is kept vague and amorphous.  ""Spirit of the Beehive"" shares these characteristics with films like ""The Innocents"" (based on Henry James ""Turn of the Screw""), and ""Night of the Hunter"".

Ana Torrent is beguiling and luminous as the young child, ""Ana"", and because of her this film is unforgettable.",1357776000,5,2135,4.7896174863387975

532583,5,6302969395,"The title is not as quite as apt a summary metaphor as one would wish, but that is a quibble; the film itself is a treasure, a beautiful, colorful Spanish film from 1972 set in 1940 Spain that I had not heard of before. Bergmann would have loved it, I bet.
Two children, Ana and Isabel are profoundly moved by a screening of the original Frankenstein movie in their small village.  Their imagination blends with reality in what might be the most exquisitely delicate and loving film any human can make.  I'd compare it to the recent, Hollywood movie The Fall which is also gorgeous beyond belief, and that I show at the drop of a hat to anyone who visits, but this film says more about the imagination be focusing on the girls' faces than The Fall accomplishes by fleshing them out.

532584,5,6302969395,"This movie is slow-paced which fits in with the rural context.
The cinematography is indeed special and beautiful.
The setting is a rural spanish village, in 1940, with barely any concrete impact from outside the village. The main characters are two young sisters, Isabel and Ana.

The child-perspective is exceptionally well evoked.
There is not much music in the movie which has a powerful effect.
Almost all scenes end with a fade-out, and this creates the feel of a series of impressions.
There is not much of a story; in the first 20 minutes one experiences barely a story or direction. This does not disturb at all, it creates a certain tension.

In most scenes there is a sort of `leaving things and happenings without concrete or clear meaning': things and happenings seem to be left to themselves. In combination with the child-perspective this is quite powerful.
This leaving things to themselves also creates a mysterious atmosphere, an `unheimlichkeit', an atmosphere that somehow becomes charged.
The theme of death is repeatedly present, in various ways.
The mother of the girls has little contact with them; she appears unhappy, passive, possibly traumatized. The father of the girls has a couple of times proper contact with the girls.

I do not know much of Spanish politics and history and I am convinced that this movie is a pearl without reading/experiencing political-historical symbolism in(to) it.

The movie is well-proportioned, with few exaggerations or artificial input.
The acting of the sisters, especially of Ana, is amazing, powerful.

All in all, this is an exceptional good movie, proportionate and subtle, a veritable artistic achievement, with beautiful images and a powerful evocation of the life-world of the child.

Thank you Victor Erice for this contribution.",1348617600,4,1799,5.2076124567474045
532585,4,6302969395,"Victor Erice's debut as a filmmaker back in 1973 was truly an auspicious one with The Spirit of the Beehive. The Spanish film covers in a subtle but yet effective manner the social turmoil of the time with the characters in the story especially when it comes to Ana portrayed by Ana Torrent who at the time was a brilliant child actress with her wide mysterious eyes and countenance of intrigue. You can also appreciate her in another film she was in as a child called Cria Cuervos and later as an adult in Alejandro Amenabar's Tesis.

From the beginning you sense the distant harmony between the wife and husband where the wife writes letters that'll never be mailed and the husband puts up barriers by being absorbed in his work on the beehives. You get a feel of the desolate location of the seemingly disregarded house where the family lives.

Then the story of the two little sisters starts to take over. We have Ana and Isabel who go to the local hall of the small town to watch Hollywood's 1930's interpretation of Frankenstein on a film reel. You could see the children are captivated by the story of the monster particularly Ana who has questions about it even when she's still watching the movie. Isabel being the more menacing one of the two starts to invent stories to her sister about the monster at hand suggesting that she has even seen one in an abandoned small house near a well. Needless to say, Ana begins to explore the area and finds one day an adult's footprint on the ground leaving her to wonder even more about what her sister told her. Isabel in the meantime begins to play dirty tricks on her sister even playing dead at one point where Ana is deeply startled and begins to pull away from her.

What we see next is a fugitive soldier found by Ana in the abandoned house who later gets found and killed by Franco officers.  Ana develops an innocent but wordless rapport with the man that began from the first encounter with each other. In a symbolic way, you can say that by Ana giving him an apple for him to eat in that first instance when they met is her representation against fascism.

When the father is called to identify the man's body, he is puzzled as to why the man has his musical watch and coat. At breakfast, he takes out his watch and observes his daughters and solely by body language is able to tell Ana is the guilty one.  But he waits until he catches Ana at the abandoned house looking for the man. Ana is startled by her father's presence and runs away. This is where a pivotal change happens in Ana's psyche. This is where she imagines herself in a scene similar to the Frankenstein movie where the little girl meets the monster for the first time. After Ana is found, she doesn't eat or sleep and won't speak to anyone. Her sister comes to make amends with her in the room where Ana is finally getting some sleep. It seems the runaway incident of Ana is pulling the family closer together because even the wife begins to show some affection and care for her husband.

At the very end of the movie, Ana walks to her window at night and hears a train in the far distance and prays to the soul of the monster letting him know she is there.",1343520000,2,3185,4.388135593220339
532586,5,6302969395,"WOW - I can't be-LEEV how many folks get this movie wrong or just get nothing. Some comments make me think the setting might not be clear - this powerful movie takes place immediately AFTER the bloody Spanish Civil War and this family was on the losing side. Dictator Franco has taken over and they have moved from the big city to this middle-of-nowhere village in a desperate attempt to find a safe haven. They are lucky to still have their skins and the enforced quietude is the whole point - the situation is monstrous and BOTH little girls are reacting to that.

This movie is about the characters - it's an interior movie, about people's insides, no big explosions except emotional ones. The ""whispering"" scenes between the two sisters alone have more juice than most Hollywood schlockbusters. Have we lost the ability to empathize with vivid, living characters onscreen? Check it again folks!",1341187200,2,898,4.8311688311688314
532587,4,6302969395,"The Spirit Of The Beehive is an excellent and realistic portrait of childhood, with less Malickian mysticism and more realism; in that the `realism' of a child is a different mysticism than 'adult' mysticism; or perhaps enchantment is a better term. That term also explains Ana's ideals about life, and why she stares at her father's glass beehive relentlessly, for she sees an order in it that is absent in her existence. This metaphor is far more cogent and powerful than the facile political connotations impugned. In fact, one can even argue that Ana's ordered home (replete with honeycomb shaped windows) and home life are manifestations of the beehive she loves, and, just as we view her with intent, so does she view and imbue the bees' lives. The outside world- politicized or not, by comparison, is no beehive, and things need to be ordered, by force, or by suppression- the elision of the drowning scene in Frankenstein is a good illustration of this for the diegesis of the film is her perspective, and she would likely close her eyes to that scene anyway, which is why the actual film also elides the dream sequence of Ana and the monster, as its hands seem to move to grab her.

  Watching films from certain periods in one's life, for the first time, is an odd experience, for often it is as if one is backfilling one's own past, altering it subtly as if one had experienced the recent past as a decades' old memory, as if it had been there all along. Throughout Erice's film, I had images and emotions of what my own existence in 1973, the year of the The Spirit Of The Beehive's release, was but, alack, in real life, I am an Isabel, not an Ana, thus I can discern the real from the irreal. On the positive side, when I state that Victor Erice's debut film is a cinema masterpiece and classic, you can rest assured that it is. Really.",1340236800,2,1850,4.532934131736527
532588,5,6302969395,"I chanced across Spirit of the Beehive in a 100 best foreign language film list and made it a mind to watch it just after seeing one screenshot.
This highly under-rated and lesser known film is a masterpiece of Victor Erice that chronicles a few days in the lives of two girls in a small town in Spain. They see Frankenstein in a traveling road show and the younger sister is unable to come to terms with the confusing ideals of good and evil she has seen on screen. We see the girls through each others' eyes and then contrast it with their parents who seem to have lives that are clearly tainted by something from their histories.
Shot beautifully, each frame is mesmerizing. The child actors are so natural, occasionally through the movie one has flashbacks of scenes from their own childhood.
A metaphor for General Franco's unending regime, the film works even as a beautiful story of childhood.
If I had to write that list, I would include this in the top 10.",1322870400,,965,4.52
532589,4,6302969395,"I suspect you have to watch this film on the big screen to get the intended impact. Watching it on a laptop, as I did, the sensory immersion you need (like the spellbound response of the children watching ""Frankenstein"" in the film) is hard to achieve and sustain. The narratives of the film are multiple and mostly implied - viewers are left to connect a lot of the dots and to fill in many, many blanks. This mimics, maybe, the way we all watched movies made for adults when we were as young as the young sisters in the film.

The film seems intent on portraying the experience of isolation (emotional and geographical) and a near total enervation. The adults in the film seem to be sleep walking, seemingly in shock and apparently stunned by untold losses in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. It's important to remember, too, that Franco was still in power when the film was made - the exuberance of Spanish cinema that we know now was only a dream of a possible future. As in the film and literature that emerges during most repressive regimes (Iran today, for example), this film articulates its ideas by way of considerable indirection. Its being held in high regard as an international classic is due in part to that achievement.

Anyway, best advice: watch this film on the largest screen you can find and be prepared for an experience a lot like watching fascinating formations of clouds drift overhead in a summer sky. If you need more action and a stronger storyline than that, you may find this film too meditative.",1275177600,4,1533,4.611721611721611

Too long a preface to the main moment, the appearance of the wounded soldier. No connection between Frankenstein, the beehive the mother's lost love and the murder.  Everyone walks in slow motion and speaks in whispers without actually moving their lips.  It is bad for a movie to leave the viewer saying, so what?",1253836800,2,449,4.506172839506172
532616,5,6302969395,"Some films are just so amazing that one cannot put into words just how truly remarkable the film really is.  `El Espiritu de la Colmena' is one of those films.  There are few words spoken throughout the film, but the rich imagery and the delicate handling of the childlike revelations are so full of life and meaning that words become obsolete.

So, much like the film, I'll try and expose depth in this review without the use of too many words.

The film takes place in the early 1940's when two young girls living in a small Spanish village attend a showing of James Whale's 1931 classic horror film `Frankenstein'.  Upon leaving the showing young Ana is visibly affected by what she has witnessed, but just how or why is rather ambiguous.  She becomes obsessed with finding the monster, a creature her sister Isabel has sworn is still alive and living close by.  The film shifts focus between reality and fantasy as Ana searches outwardly as well as internally for Frankenstein.

Shortly after watching this film I sat down to watch another foreign masterpiece entitled `Ivan's Childhood' and both films are very similar in structure and even meaning.  Both use visual's over dialog to propel the films core, both balancing reality and fantasy in order to build two sides to a very complex and moving story.

Using the awe-inspiring Ana Torrent (merely six-years-old) as his star, director Victor Erice did his film a major service for it is this young girl who really sells this film for the audience.  Not only is she adorable (she looks almost identical to my daughter, so maybe I'm a tad partial) but her otherworldly stare and her ambiguous nature makes for so many beautiful moments of sincere emotional humanity within the films frames.  She captures the childlike innocence, naivety and wonderment that is so essential to propelling the films central focus.  She embodies this young girl by refraining from acting and just simply `being'.

The film is one that may be hard to read and it may require multiple viewings to truly understand what all this film has to say.  What is so mesmerizing about this film is that it can be taken many different ways (as can the meaning behind the films title, which is pure genius if you ask me) and so the films interpretation is pretty open ended.  A film like this can be enjoyed and contemplated and discussed for all eternity for there is no right or wrong answer when considering the films overall meaning.  What this film is for me can be totally removed from what it is to you, but in the end as long as it becomes something then it has done its job.

It is rare to find a film so poetically fascinating in a sea full of depressingly mundane cinematic endeavors.  This has been heralded as the best film to come out of Spain, and personally I'd take it a step further.

This is one of the best films to come out of anywhere.",1240272000,7,2880,4.620825147347741
532617,5,6302969395,"The first question that comes to my mind, and this movie provokes lots of them, would be, how different would the film be if young Ana had seen another  movie than James Whale's Frankenstein? Clearly, the choice of the movie is of vital importance.

The movie does not offer easy answers, though it's highly suggestive. There are many lengthy sequences with few or no words spoken, which helps to emphasize the isolation of the two young sisters , and also the divide between their parents. Scenes such as the two young girls exploring an empty building in the middle of a vast field are almost hypnotic. The music is used to powerful effect, with sad little melodies played on the flute and the piano.

The silence that hangs heavily over all the characters seems implicitly part of the legacy of the Spanish Civil War, which has only ended recently. There is no overt political commentary, but symbols and cryptic actions by the characters hint at depths of meaning. The film can be taken simply as an exploration of a child's world of fantasy, and attempting to make sense of the adult world around her, but the Spanish Civil War connection is still significant, if not obvious. One of the first images in the movie is of the Falange symbol of the yoke and arrows painted on the wall of a building, and there is a photograph of Franco in the school room. The man who jumps off a train and hides in the old barn is presumably an escaped Loyalist prisoner. Some viewers have pointed out that the mother writes to an unknown man in what is a refugee camp in France, where many Loyalists ended up imprisoned by the Franco regime after the war. The father listens to some unknown radio broadcast, that could be war news from England , since the time is 1940, and Hitler is now waging all out conquest of Europe.

The significance of Frankenstein is the most accessible imagery for the non-Spanish viewer. We see the villagers excitedly asking the travelling movie showman about what picture he is going to present, and he says it's a wonderful picture. American viewers familiar with the James Whale classic must find it odd to see the so familiar images of Edward Van Sloan introducing the film in dubbed Spanish, and little Marilyn Harris inviting Karloff's Monster to play with her, also in someone else's voice speaking Spanish. The magic of the scene still works beautifully, and the audience of mainly children is enrapt. Director Erice speaks on the DVD extra disc about the never to be recaptured moment of young Ana Torrent's authentic reaction to the scene of the Monster and the little girl, and it is truly a stunning moment that is one of the most memorable in the picture.

There are some very disturbing moments in this picture, including older sister Isabel's near strangling of the family's pet cat, and her cruel prank played on her naive litle sister. But that last mentioned scene is one of the most important in the movie, however difficult to watch.

This film demands patience on the part of the viewer and can be frustrating in that it offers few answers. It's an experience that is highly unusual, rather than a typical movie to watch for entertainment. I find echoes in it of both Whistle Down the Wind and To Kill A Mockingbird, as well as Frankenstein, of course. It's a film that almost demands to be watched many times.

One final note: the featurette on the making of the film, and the re-visiting of the scenes, and the showing of the movie to the residents of the town where it was filmed twenty-five years earlier, are enchanting. The lovely Ana Torrent, shown as a beautiful woman in her mid- thirties, walks around the house, the field, the school room, and watches herself as a child. An unexpectedly amusing moment occurs when Teresa Gimpera reminisces about the child Ana being "" kind of a pain"" one day, as they were filming the scene of the mother brushing Ana's hair.

This movie will not appeal to everyone, but for those touched by it, it is unforgettable.",1236729600,4,3998,4.652974504249292
532618,5,6302969395,"Every once in a while I stumble upon a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece of childhood set in Franco's Spain in 1940.  There are political allusions and asides that somehow escaped Franco's censors, or maybe they were indulged.  It matters not because the bleak landscape surrounding the house with its honeycombed windows and its honey colored light says more than words could.

I would compare this favorably with two other masterpieces of childhood, the French films, Jeux interdits (Forbidden Games) (1952), and Ponette (1996)  What is explored in all three of these films is the reality of childhood that we have forgotten, the intensity of first knowledge, of things experienced for the first time, the wonder and the horror that such experiences may contain.  But more than that there is the unconditioned sense of life that the child experiences.  When Ana sees the fugitive (from Franco, one imagines) who has injured his leg jumping off the train, she immediately knows what is essential in this situation.  The man is hurt.  He is hungry.  He needs help.  She gives him an apple from her lunch pail, which he eagerly devours.  Although she has been scared by a Frankenstein movie and her sister's pretence of death and gloved hands around her face, she is not afraid.

This is the most laconic of films.  Almost everything is done with the camera and the events.  The children laugh and play and watch the world with wonder.  They say a few words, direct and to the point.  Six year old Ana (Ana Torrent) has dark eyes as big as saucers which she trains on the world as if to bore into the very nature of existence.  Her older sister Isabel's eyes sometimes form slits of mischief or delight as she tests reality or teases her sister.

The pace of the film is deliberately slow.  The essay by famed Spanish film expert Paul Julian Smith contained in the booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection two-disc set includes Smith's remark that when the film was first shown in San Sebastian in 1973 where it won the main prize, ""Some of the audience, restless at the film's slow pace, even booed.""

There is a technique in the theater, not so much observed today, that also works well in movies.  Slow it down, begin with everyday, mundane events, and play them long like honey slowly oozing, so much the better to contrast with the events to come, and give those events the contrast they deserve as they have in real life.  Director Victor Erice does this to fine effect.  How drawn out seem the lessons at school, and how tedious.  But such is the life of a child when every day is a little eternity, where so much happens that when the lights go out, the child falls into a deep, dreamless sleep for many hours at a stretch.  We have forgotten this world of the child, but Erice reminds us.

I was not restless because, although the pace is indeed slow, the cinematography by Luis Cuadrado and the terse silent events of innocence set against the background of the late Spanish Civil War portended events to come.  Just what those events might be it was impossible to guess; however it was clear there would be no compromise with audience expectations or any catering to any sort of correctness, political or otherwise.  And this is part of what makes a great film.

Character, story, suspense, an important theme, beautiful visuals, truth--artistic truth of course, psychological human truth--and attention to detail: these are also what make a great film.  And they are all here in El espritu de la colmena.

Erice plays with our emotions of course.  We are nearly terrified that something is going to happen to these beautiful little girls, and indeed once or twice it appears that our worst fears are realized.  Are they or are they not?

It is said that Ana was traumatized by viewing the Frankenstein movie and by her sister's horrid joke, and then by the blood she sees in the old building by the well where the fugitive had rested.  But I think it would be better to say that Ana was challenged by new-found knowledge of the ever close proximity of death, and in reaction she ran away into her own world to find an answer.  Notice how the scene from James Wales' Frankenstein in which the monster kneels beside the water with the little girl is repeated in Ana's fantasy, and how she looks at the monster with big, wide-open, questioning, waiting eyes.  What is life, and what is death?  And, know this: I will always live in fear and dread if I do not know what they are and if cannot face them.

When she encounters the Frankenstein monster at the water's edge she has only her beauty to protect her.  But that beauty resides in our head--in Frankenstein's head--and so she is safe.  This is part of the deep psychology of the film, wondrously achieved, perhaps part by art and part by happenstance.

I believe that is what Ana experienced in her mind.  But we do not know.  We do not know the mind of the child.  And we have forgotten what it is to be a child.  Erice's masterpiece helps us to remember.

There is a documentary about the film on the second disc with interviews with Erice and with Angel Fernandez Santos who worked with Erice on the script, and others.  We see Ana Torrent all grown up, which is what I most wanted to see.  And we learn how the film was made.  A masterpiece, it is my belief, whether it is in cinema or literature, in chess or music, or in some other art form always brings together unconscious elements that fuse with conscious intent.  It is only later that we recognize what happened.",1208563200,14,5545,4.611848825331972
532619,3,6302969395,"I should start by saying that before seeing this film I knew nothing about Spanish cinema. And now that I have seen it I feel I know even less. I bought the DVD (a mistake) because I respect the Criterion Collection and the blurb on the back of the box made it sound interesting (also I had a discount coupon burning a hole in my pocket). There is no point in giving away the plot - which is quite sparse. The acting by the two little girls is very good. Audiences should be warned that there is an unpleasant scene involving a house cat. I don't know how many million people were killed in the Spanish Civil War; not a single one of those deaths upsets me because they are just abstractions. But when you hurt a cat you stroke my fur the wrong way. The movie takes place after this war and references to it are indirect and (to an ignorant foreigner like me) rather obscure. I have read some of the other reviews here and it amazes me that some people love this film. I suppose with love there are no explanations. If you still are thinking about seeing this film, rent it but don't buy it. I hope that you can find meanings in it which are apparently beyond my simple view.",1205452800,9,1175,4.226666666666667
532620,3,6302969395,"Sorry, I bought this and tried to appreciate it.  The Spirit of the Beehive is widely regarded as a supreme classic in Spanish film literature.  Plus I love Criterion films, but this time I just couldn't catch the significance.
It's set in Spain 1940, where a young girl watches the classic movie Frankenstein and becomes entranced by the memory of it.  And, uh well, that's pretty much it.  The narrative simmers around her outlook and imagination as that character is engrained deeply in her mind.
This movie is beautifully shot, but there just isn't much going on.  I really like slow paced movies, but I need a little something to hold my interest.  This movie takes place after the country's devastating civil war, which I tried to factor in.
Overall, this is a unique film that will require some patience.  Any comments or insight anyone has will be greatly appreciated.",1202515200,17,876,4.8
532621,4,6302969395,"""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973), an impressive cinematic debut by Victor Erice is a poignant study of a human isolation and fragile innocence. It is also about power of film, and its ability to affect and even change a life of a child. While watching the film, we can relieve our own childhood movie experiences and our own fascination and readiness for miracle to happen. At the same time, ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" is a thoughtful commentary on the tragedy of Spanish Civil War. Eight-year-old Ana Torrent gives an unforgettable performance as Ana, a lonely, quiet, dreamy little girl with wide-open dark sad eyes who enters the world of fantasy when she sees the famous 1931 film ""Frankenstein"". Ana becomes obsessed with Boris Karloff's good -bad monster, is convinced that he actually exists, and tries to find him. As her obsession grows, the world of her imagination becomes more and more real for her and most of the film's events take place inside her mind. ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" may be one of few most haunting films about childhood ever made, and it stands very close to Rene Clement's ""Forbidden Games"" (1951) - another disturbing exploration of the war and how it affects the gentlest, the weakest, and the most innocent - the children.

532622,4,6302969395,"I find it hard to make a coherent description of this movie because it operates in such an offbeat and allusive way. What is it? A supernatural story? An exercise in cinematography? A potpourri of suggestive ideas? As one reviewer suggests, a cry against tyranny?

Having just seen it, and reflecting a little, I think the ""cry against tyranny"" has a lot to do with it. That title, that scene-setting in a bee-keeper's world: the opening scenes where Fernando examines his little creatures and transfers a comb from one position to another: what an apt metaphor for undiluted power.  With the honeycomb-patterned windows in the house, and - there's no other word, ""honey""-colored stone of the buildings, we never forget that all the little busy-ness of our daily life may be subject to forces outside our control, either human or - perhaps - deeper or higher. Incidentally, on the ""beehive"" theme, isn't the scene of the children flocking in groups into the door of the big rectangular school irresistibly reminiscent of bees returning to the hive?

But I am left with questions. Did Ana really see Frankenstein's monster (= a spook movie?) or was it all fantasy?- the latter, I think. And what no-one else seems to have mentioned, was the fugitive sheltering in the old building Laura's lover, escaped and trying to return to see her? She  certainly had to exert tremendous self-control after his death, though there is admittedly no indication that she got to see the body. But she burned the letter she was going to send...or was that just a realization that ancient fantasies are not good to hold on to, after Ana's disaster?

Much to ponder.",1194048000,10,1646,4.843416370106762
532623,5,6302969395,"Many first time viewers of The Spirit of the Beehive will watch it and go ""huh?""  As a result, they may decide that art film (or international film) is beyond them OR that it is a bad film. Neither is true if some basic preparations are made. Not everyone comes ready made to understand a great work of art -- nor should we feel guilty because we aren't. Some simple backgrounding can make all the difference.

Several specific simple preparations can help. (1)Read up a little on the Spanish Civil War. This can help set the time and place of the film. Even a skimming of Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls could help adjust one's mind. (2) Watch Whale's film ""Frankenstein."" This can set a psychological context. Ana, as a little girl, is growing into an awareness of her Self and her world -- so too is Frankenstein's monster. It also helps set a literal context -- how else can one understand the relationship between the monster and Ana in Beehive if one doesn't understand the incident in ""Frankenstein"" between the monster and the little girl he accidentally kills. (3) Re-read a traditional fairy tale or two (not Disney, try Hans Christian Andersen or the Brothers Grimm). This will help establish the ""once upon a time-ish"" way of thinking of Beehive. Remember how often the children in fairy tales are abandoned -- one or both of their parents are dead, the remaining parent is often separated from their own children either because s/he is preoccupied with putting food on the table or is lost in memories of the past. Think too of the relationship between siblings in fairy tales -- while the older sister in Beehive is not quite the ugly stepsister of narrative fame, she is not above the (fairly normal) petty torture of her little sister. (4) Look at a few of Vermeer's paintings and read a bit about his use of light. This can help one ""get"" the visual aesthetic that Beehive captures. (5) Read a few reviews. Don't assume they are right (or wrong) -- read them to get a sense of what to look for in the film and what others have appreciated (or not) about Beehive.

Finally, there is one other very important strategy to appreciate Beehive -- watch it more than once. Even a popcorn flick takes more than one viewing to catch the subtle details. So why feel we must ""get"" a more demanding film in one sitting. Watch it the first time for a general sense of what is going on (or, in the case of Beehive, a general sense of bafflement). Try to figure out who is who (printing out a cast list from IMDB helps!) Then watch it again. The storyline starts to make more sense and the dreaminess seems to have more purpose. Like the honey hidden away in the comb of a real beehive, the sweetness of the film emerges and one realizes that this poetic journey into awareness really does offer us something for understanding ourselves and our world more fully.

532669,5,6302969395,"""The Spirit of the Beehive"" is a film that was long considered one of (if not the) finest Spanish film. It's now presented in a gorgeous transfer by The Criterion Collection, which seems to only improve each year in quality and quantity. It's an odd film, that some call disturbing. It's not disturbing, at least to me, but it does have a few thought-provoking and haunting images occupying it. I think what Spirit of the Beehive does best is that it showcases truly one of the finest performances I've ever seen by an adolescent. A performance that ranks right up there with Jean-Pierre Leaud from The 400 Blows, although the child in that film and the child in this one are quite different. I don't know the young actresses name, but she's amazing. The movie's opening credits feature children's drawings, before giving us the title card ""Once Upon a Time..."" In a small Mexican village, the movie 'Frankenstein' is being shown and the entire town is enthralled by the movie. Two particular kids find the movie particularly good, two sisters named Ana and Isabel. During the movie Ana poses a question to Isabel, regarding one of the most famous scenes in the movie. Why did Frankenstein kill the girl? And why was Frankenstein, as a result, killed? Isabel doesn't know, so she instead tells Ana that the monster is not dead at all, but living in an abandoned farmhouse-type thing that sits in the middle of a field. Ana begins frequenting this place, believing that Frankenstein actually lives there...Who knows? Maybe she's right. A lot of people mention the overtones of war in the film and things like that, but whether you've caught those or not is irrelevant. The movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking. Some of the images in the film are bound to stay with you for days. I guess I should add that the ""beehive"" works into the title, because the girls' father works around beehives. Sorry about the chronology of the review, but anyway...The movie has some beautiful shots (one of the most haunting one is of Frankenstein and Ana, the other is the final shot of the film), a haunting musical score;

All of which are equally important in creating the mood and atmosphere of this film. Foreign film/Criterion Collection lovers. See this movie.

532670,5,6302969395,"I am Spanish and I do beleive this is one of the geatest films in the history of Spanish cinema. I won't repeat the reasons given by reviewers here and elsewhere. So I'll come to the point. I eagerly awaited the Criterion edition to give away my old DVD copy released in Spain by Manga films. After all Criterion has gained an oustanding reputation for the great care they take in their editions. Well, their transfer looks certainly better than the one in the Spanish release, everything bathed in a warm honey colour. A bit grainy at times, the grain may be present in the negative. But the aspect ratio looked wrong to me and when I compared it with my Spanish edition I realized the picture has been zoomed to fill as much as possible the widesreen, with unnecesary loss of picture information at the top and the bottom. I wonder why even Criterion is so afraid of having black bars at the left and right of the screen. It may seem a small point, but in a film like this one the whole frame should be respected. I can't imagine Erice approving this compromise. But even if he did, it was wrong. The framing looks much better in my old copy. Now I cannot give it away. And in my rating I must drop a star just for that. Shame.",1160265600,70,1229,4.301724137931035
532671,5,6302969395,"One of the most recent additions to my film collection is Vctor Erice's Espritu de la colmena (The spirit of the Beehive), made in 1973 in Spain.  Franco's dictatorship was in its waning years - but the censorship the Generalissimo had fostered still remained in effect - many directors of the day had to fight to have their films shown.  If they portrayed anything that had to do with the Spanish Civil War - especially showing the Resistance in a favorable light - they had to do it metaphorically.  Some films were cut to ribbons by the censors, some were delayed almost indefinitely - and some never saw the light of day (or the dark of a cinema, if you like).

Erice's first feature is set in 1940, and shows a Spain still reeling from the pain of the civil war.  Set in a small village on the Castilian plain, the film speaks volumes about both the physical and psychological damage done by the conflict.  The village is seen to be quite run down - the family at the center of the story lives in relative comfort in a large old manor house, but it, too, is in a state of neglect and disrepair.  While quite spacious compared to the homes of their neighbors, the rooms are shown to contain little furniture - and the one meal we see the family sharing, a breakfast, is a sparse one.

The members of the family seem to exist in their own isolated orbits - coming close to each other at times, but never really connecting.  The two young sisters - Ana (Ana Torrent) and Isabel (Isabel Tellera) - share more of a bond than the parents have with each other, or with their children.  The girls' father (portrayed by popular Spanish actor Fernando Fernn Gmez) is a beekeeper - the first time we see him in the film, he's tending the hives, dressed in his protective gear, looking a bit like a space explorer.  Their mother (Teresa Gimpera) writes letters to an unnamed man - from the address seen on an envelope in one scene, a refugee from the fighting living in a camp in France.  We never learn if he is a former lover, a relative, or just an old friend caught up in forces over which he has little control - but from the frequency of her letters to him, and the emotional depth of the words she writes (which we hear in a voice-over), it's obvious this is a person about whom she cares a great deal, and whose absence torments her.

The girls are the real focus of the story - especially the youngest, Ana.  She appears to be around 6 years old - at that age when the fantasies of childhood are about to be pushed aside by the realities of life, a time of difficult transition for a child.  She still accepts everything she sees as being real - fiction is an unknown concept to her.  A travelling cinema comes to town, setting up in the town hall - it's clearly something that has happened before, and we see the children gather around the van, before the dust has even settled, clamoring to know what film will be shown.

On this occasion, it happens to be James Whale's 1931 classic version of Frankenstein.  Ana and Isabel are among the children and adults who crowd into the makeshift theatre to see the film.  Ana is captivated by the entire spectacle - and as I mentioned, she's at the age when everything she sees on the screen is as real to her as what she sees on the street everyday.  Ana Torrent, the young actress who portrays Ana in the film, had never seen Frankenstein before - and in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film, we see her face in the dark, illuminated only by the light reflecting from the screen, as she reacts, honestly and openly, eyes wide in wonder, not acting, to the story before her.  At one point, she leans over to her sister Isabel and asks, `Why did the monster kill the little girl?  Why did they kill the monster?'

Isabel tells her later, as the girls lie in their beds, awaiting sleep, that `it's all make-believe - nothing in the movies is real'.  Ana's not buying it.  Still obsessed with the experience and story of the film, she later listens intently to a story Isabel tells her of a spirit that lives nearby, in an abandoned barn.  Isabel warns Ana that the spirit will only appear when called by someone with a pure heart, who believes it is real.  Ana returns to the barn several times, calling `It's me - Ana', to no avail.  After a few visits, she arrives at the barn to find it occupied - a wounded freedom fighter, on the run from Franco's guard, has taken shelter there.  When he awakens with a start, hearing a noise, he immediately draws his pistol - seeing that it's Ana, he relaxes.  Ana is either determined that this man is the spirit she has been seeking, or simply decides to make him into the spirit, and befriends him - she offers him an apple, and later sneaks out of her house with her father's jacket, to keep the man warm at night, inadvertently neglecting to remove her father's pocket watch before handing it over to him.

Ana's vision of this man as her own manifestation of the spirit is shattered when he is caught by Franco's police and killed.  Her father is called to the makeshift morgue - once again, using the town hall, returning to the scene of the film that affected Ana so much - to view the body.  The police captain has found the pocket watch on the dead man, and has connected it to Ana's father - he's obviously been brought in for questioning, probably a common practice in a society under the shadow of Franco's paranoia.  His assurances that he didn't know the man, or how his jacket and watch came to be in his possession, are evidently taken as truth, and he is allowed to take his property and go home.  When he confronts Ana with the watch, simply by opening it at the breakfast table and allowing the chiming mechanism to sound, it's pretty apparent from her facial expression that she knows something about it.  He later follows her to the barn - she doesn't know that the man has been captured and killed - and when her father attempts to talk with her there, she runs from him.  Her failure to return home prompts a search party made up of villagers scouring the woods and countryside at night, carrying lanterns - a striking visual reminder of the scene in Whale's Frankenstein when the villagers searched for the monster carrying torches.

Ana is found sleeping in the ruins of an old castle, and brought home, obviously traumatized.  As we see her sleeping in the room she shares with Isabel, we notice that Isabel's bed has been stripped of its linen - perhaps a sign that Isabel, being a couple of years older, is now in her own room, having `grown up' sufficiently in the eyes of her parents to warrant this `promotion'.  Ana's experiences have left her changed - but how much is unclear.  The border she has crossed - or is beginning to take the first steps in crossing, at least - is one that is not skipped over in the course of a day or two.  It's something that takes years to accomplish.  As the film ends, we see her poignantly calling out to her spirit once more, `It's me - Ana'.

The cinematography in this film is astonishingly beautiful - Lus Cuadrado worked miracles, not just in his camera angles and framing, but in capturing the honey-colored light that is so essential in conveying the feeling and atmosphere of this film.  In the documentary The footprints of a spirit - one of the several fine extras included in Criterion's new DVD release of the film - director Vctor Erice and his co-screenwriter Angel Fernndez Santos, speak of their original intended storyline, and how they wound up discarding the opening scenes - they said that once they started filming, they realized that the opening, looking back from the present to the time depicted in the body of the film, was a drag on the overall effect.  It's an interesting look into the creative process.

As it turned out, the film is as close to perfect as cinema can get.  Criterion has done a masterful job in restoring and packaging it for re-release.  Since I've never had the opportunity to see this work in a theatre on the big screen, I have nothing with which to compare it - but I can say that this is one of the most beautifully filmed, moving cinematic creations I've ever experienced.",1159833600,21,8202,4.436

532673,4,6302969395,"This film is based on some interesting phenomenon that occurred during a specific historical time in Spain, just prior to World War II. The beginning scene is idyllic and peaceful, where Fernando is tending beehives. The fact that there is no musical accompaniment, just the sounds of nature and life makes the film more unique, a tad eerie and very remarkable, creating emotional expectations and a depth that is subtle but very intense. The best acting is by Ana, a young girl about 6 years of age. She is perfectly cast in her role. Her innocence and charm are real and natural. Everyone who views her will return to aspects of their own childhood on certain levels. The innocent times when, no matter what happened, life was good, the world was new, exciting and filled with first discoveries. In this film ... one comes to expect ... a certain awakening or shocking event ... something surprising with a huge emotional impact ... coming out of the clear blue.

The family lives in a two story stone villa that looks almost like a mansion except for the stones which look hewn from the local soil, despite the large iron gate, there is an earthiness to the building. It has an overly large foyer ... The second level is where the family lives. Ana and her sister, Isabel who is about 10 or 11 years old share a bedroom which has single twin beds in a lovely room furnished with antiques. Fernando has a study, there is no electricity, he uses oil lamps and candles. He has marvelous big wooden bookcases and a huge desk where he writes poetic lyrical verse about his beehives which he lovingly tends. The beehive may be the metaphor for their lives in a subtle sort of way.

The camera slowly rolls over stone buildings and dirt roads in the nearby village where one building is used as a movie theater. There is excitement in the air when an old truck pulls up which delivers this weeks film. Inside, adults set up wooden chairs, outside the children excitedly ask the driver whether the film is good. He reassures them, it is the best. The camera is used effectively to film the faces of many villagers of different ages ... people who work hard, they are simple but dignified, ready to view the film of the week, one of the few sources of entertainment in the town. As the film starts, there is an introduction by an announcer who advocates the miraculous discoveries of science and compares that with the creation of life by God. Yet in this film, a scientist did just that, brought to life a man-like creature he had made. Ana is fascinated by the monster, who is given a flower by a littl girl in the film but we learn later, the monster named Frankenstein killed the girl. Ana puzzles over why he did this as clearly the little girl liked him as she handed him the freshly picked flowers in her hand.

At bed time Ana can not get the film out of her mind and discusses Frankenstein and his behavior with Isabel. Isabel fabricates a story that satisfies Ana by stating Frankenstein is a spirit who can take on a body if human beings pray and sincerely believe in him, somehow twisting their religious beliefs to make this seem plausbible. Only those who truly have faith can do this. From this point forward, Ana wants to conjure up a spirit with a body and Isabel takes her to an abandoned old stone building far out in the fields, telling her a spirit lives there who might appear in bodily form if Ana believes strongly enough in him. Ana is shown to visit this farmhouse often ... alone ... looking down the well and walking around the building ... Until one day, she does find a man inside the building - fulfilling Isabel's story ... What happens afterwards,for good or bad needs to be viewed to be appreciated. The artistry and beauty of the film are beyond word descriptions at this point.

On some levels the family seems disconnected, the children do not often interact with the parents, surprisingly not even with the mother which seems unnatural. There are scenes where the family is eating and amazingly everyone at the table is silent, except for the sounds of eating. The sisters giggle and communicate with smiles and body language as children often do. Isabel pulls a trick on Ana pertaining to Frankenstein. It is heart-stopping and gut-wrenching but just what children often do. Amazing but the parents are nowhere nearby when this occurs.

Sadly, at times the creative subtle artistic approach obscures the intentions of the director; they are totally lost on the viewer ... Fernando, the father takes the girls on an outing to pick mushroom, he points out which are edible and which ones are poisonous. Toward the end, the whole town gets involved in the actions related to something that happens to Ana ... I will leave the reader to ponder what that might be hopefully there is enough information in this review to entice the reader to want to view this film. This is a highly recommended film, somewhat more complicated than it should be however appreciation for its beauty grows on the viewer long after it is viewed.

If you love the type of European cinema which is slow, dark, and sinister, then you'll like this. If you prefer something more lively, you won't.",1090886400,10,242,4.260869565217392
532675,3,6302969395,"This movie is trying to convey something deep and I believe its hidden in there somewhere amongst the symbolism and seemingly unconnected dream-like sequences.  But for the effort to delve to that meaning with a lack of a clear-cut story:  much is required and little is gained.  With that said this movie has its merits.
Shot in 1973, it has been garnered with a host of film festival awards the world over from Paris to Chicago to London.  I suppose the Brits got it right in awarding ""The Spirit of the Beehive,"" with Best Photography, for that's one thing Victor Erice nails...beautiful thought-provoking, mood enhancing cinematography.  It has been called the best Spanish film ever made by the NYT and I think that's throwing away the honey with the beehive.  Almodovar's ""All About My Mother,"" Leon's ""Monday in the Sun,"" or Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou,"" or ""Land Without Bread,"" all come to mind topping ""Spirit,"" for Espana's top celluloid honors.
The thin story-line here sounds compelling enough.  Two young girls see the movie Frankenstein on the first day of WWII in an isolated Spanish village.  Ana, a role wonderfully played by an enchanting young girl (actress Ana Torrent) becomes increasingly isolated and sets about to discover a real-life Frankenstein.  Parallel's to Mary Shelley's story are threaded through the film ending in a non-conclusive dream sequence.  Giving credit to the director, we are left with a compelling sense of isolation, a sense of the war's creeping into a remote Spanish village, and a sense that it matters what happens to the main character Ana.  But what we don't get is storytelling.  Pseudo-events are loosely connected together without any drama, suspense, or continuity.  Think...""Thin Red Line,"" meets Ingmar Bergman in Spanish.
There are images that are left with you...the cruel and equally isolated sister Isabel putting a strangle hold on a black cat, Ana's father working the beehive while capturing compelling poetry about the bees work and how it relates to the human experience.  I wouldn't dissuade you from watching this film if you are a fan of all cinema foreign or Spanish flicks, but for the average viewer out there...save the cinematography, this one's slow.",1050105600,16,2227,5.082417582417582
532676,5,6302969395,"The opening scenes present each character in their private world.  Laura, the mother, is writing a letter to a lover who may or not be merely imagined. This is her fiction.
 Fernando attends his bees and in the privacy of his library meditates on the nature of existence using the beehive and the industrious workings of the bees within as a metaphor for civilization. The slightest change upsets the bees work...and being 1943 great changes have altered the fabric of life in Spain. We glimpse Fernando's state of mind by reading his accounts of the bees daily activity and for him lifes once rich rituals it is clear have now been reduced to pointlessness and sadness.
For Laura these changes Spain has gone through have forever altered the way she sees life. She feels life can no longer be embraced and lived to the fullest as it once could.

  The structure of society which would have given the parents some sense of purpose and significance has collapsed.  And the way they sleepwalk through their lives leaves the children feeling like orphans. The only example they have of what life is is learned at school and in the movie theatre. The girls are particularly moved by a showing of the classic Frankenstein. For them this large melancholy figure seems strangely familiar. What they cannot fathom is why the friendly beast kills the little girl in the movie. The youngest girls mind will not be put to rest until she finds her answer.
The movie's haunting scenes which veer between carefree innocence and haunting confrontation with stark reality are perfectly complimented by the Luis de Pablo soundtrack. One of the strangest most disturbing melodies is played by Laura herself. And throughout the film director Victor Erice's camera will on occasion come to rest on one of the mansion's paintings which depict man as a hopelessly lost creature among forces that are beyond his comprehension.  The childrens imaginations are haunted by a world beyond their comprehension and so are the adult imaginations and so is the viewers. Victor Erice presents each life as a separate narrative and the narrative lines do not overlap. The films stark strategy emphasizes the lack of cohesion in Spanish life. Each character is lost within themselves. Poetic and stark and yet beautiful as the best Spanish poetry.",1043452800,45,2313,4.930591259640103
532677,5,6302969395,"'Spirit Of The Beehive', which begins 'Once upon a time...', uses children's drawings in its opening credits, anticipating the film's key scenes, spaces and motifs.  This alerts us to the child's-eye view the film will largely take, focusing on two young sisters in s small Spanish village, Segovia, in 1940.  They live in a vast, decaying mansion with their parents (a solitary, obsessive beekeeper, and a mother dreaming of her exiled lover), and servants.  When James Whale's 'Frankenstein' is shown in the village hall, the younger sister, Ana, is particularly haunted by the scene in which the monster plays with a little girl by the side of a lake, throwing floating daisies onto the water.  Her sister tells her that the monster didn't die in the film, but that his spirit lurks around an nearby abandoned outhouse, beside a well in an arid plain. Spotting a large footstep in the area, Ana prepares herself to meet the spirit.
Victor Erice's film, often conidered the greatest ever made in Spain, is at once ascetic and sensual.  It is ascetic in its evocation of a depleted Spain, one year after the bloody trauma of the Civil War, a place heavy with silences and suppressed emotions, parched, peeling buildings surrounded by dusty streets and outlying areas as dully stagnant as this new way of life, former granduer a dessicated memory.  The film is sensual in the way this world is seen, coloured and re-imagined by the two young heroines, especially intense, dark, bow-legged Ana.  The house they live in, like the beehive their father tends (grilled like a honeycomb, glowing with an amber light), is a silent, claustrophobic, ill-lit mansion, stripped of its personal decor, the kind of haunted house pregnant with silent screasm we find in late Bergman (e.g. 'Cries and Whispers').  But while their exhausted, experience-reeling parents give up, the girls explore its mysteries like the innocent heroines of Gothic fiction or fairy tales.  There is very little dialogue in the film, limited to the remnants of civilisation (school) or the elegiac confessions of letters and diaries - much of 'Spirit' is choreographed around brooding, pregnant, enigmatic rituals.
In a film haunted by ghosts and the charred traces of a vanished way of life, even the characters, in their movements and silences, move around familiar spaces like phantoms.  The two great unspoken voids of the film - the Civil War and Franco - are only indirectly alluded to, and yet they shape this world, they are the spirit of this beehive.  A necessarily symbolic and allusive work (made under the Fascists, its strategies, allegories and even style recall Eastern European films made under similar totalitarian regimes), metaphors work in complex, shifting patterns, in once sense, connecting characters in unexpected ways (trains, watches, monsters etc.), they are a further grid constricting these dead characters.  On another, they magic another reality, of spirits, ghosts, memories, shadows beyond the reach of a spirit-destroying regime that would burn all records of alternative possibilities and realities.  Even if it achieved nothing else - and 'Spirit' is one of the most potent, quietly stunning and moving films in all cinema - then Erice's movie would be precious for rescuing 'Frankenstein' from camp, and restoring its austere beauty.",1019433600,105,3337,5.157407407407407

7833977,5,6302969395,"Made at the height of the Franco regime, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE has been read an an allegory of the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath, concentrating particularly on the destruction wrought amongst those who served in it and their families.

Even for those viewers unacquainted with Spanish history, the film is pregnant with meaning.  For those interested in the use of intertexts, director Victor Erice's direct quotation from James Whale's seminal FRANKENSTEIN (1931) introduces us to the idea of spirits and human (re) creation that dominates the narrative.  Little Ana (Ana Torrent) is duped by her sister Isabel (Isabel Tellera) into believing that there lurks a spirit close by their isolated farmhouse who can be conjured up simply by wishing for its presence.  Ana encounters a military deserter and believes that he is the spirit.  Her discovery transports her into a dream-world where she re-enacts the famous sequence from Whale's film where the monster meets the young girl.  In SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE the monster (Jos Villasante) does not kill Ana, but leaves her unable (or perhaps) unwilling to separate fantasy from ""reality.""  Through such strategies director Erice forces to question our ontologies; do we really know what being ""human"" is, and can we separate this state of being from our imagination?

This theme acquires a religious dimension through repeated shots of Jesus Christ surrounded by the Apostles and a human skull.  In Christianity we are taught to place our trust in the Holy Spirit, but how do we know that this is a ""good"" spirit, as opposed to the ""evil"" spirit conjured up in Ana's mind.  Erice leaves us with no answer.

From thence it is but a short thematic step to reflect on Ana's father Don Fernando (Fernando Fernn Gmez) and his tendency to write his scientific discoveries about his beehives in a journal, in a manner similar to Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein in Whale's film.  Does Don Fernando like to consider himself a Creator, performing experiments with bees rather than human beings?  Or are they linked in some way?  Erice emphasizes the parallels through shots of the patterned windows of Don Fernando's house, which are shaped much the same as the honeycombs in his beehives.

The film's narrative unfolds slowly, with plenty of static shots in which characters move in and out of the frame.  Light is an important element of the mise-en-scene, with our attention focused deliberately on the two little girls' faces, as well as those of their parents.  This visual strategy once again forces us to reflect on what separates human beings from other species, spirits as well as bees.

THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE is a highly complex work, whose sophisticated visual style and structure warrants repeated viewings.  A true classic of European cinema.",1448928000,3,2806,5.021598272138229
