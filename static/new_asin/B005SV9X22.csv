4887216,5,B005SV9X22,"This concert is incredible. It only proves that the Lady is a real artist, and one who is not going anywhere for a long time. You could liken her to being as big as Elvis, if not bigger already. And if not, then she will be.

Her theatrics are brilliant and she sounds utterly amazing live. The best artist around today, and the most talented artist to have come out of the music industry in the past 20 years.

This DVD is well worth every penny, and will serve as a memory for one of the biggest and greatest tours in music history: The Monster Ball.",1320710400,15,552,4.19811320754717
4887217,1,B005SV9X22,"I'm sorry, but this dvd isn't that great. She is a lot better live, but the way this is shot is just so disappointing.",1320192000,17,118,3.9583333333333335
4887218,4,B005SV9X22,"This is a great capture of the two year long, Monster Ball Tour.
I'm not going to ""compare"" Lady Gaga to her peers but I would like to say, what I feel makes her stand-out is her ability to connect with her audience.  She does this by sharing stories and humanizing herself throughout the show.  This rare ability puts Lady Gaga at a level all her own.  She reminds us that shes a human being just like everyone in the crowd and that even when no one else believed in her, she believed in herself.  The other aspect that makes Lady Gaga standout from her peers is her technical talent....she CAN REALLY SING!  Her voice is powerful and emotive. She also plays the piano amongst other instruments.  Gaga is a musicians musician and a pop star rolled into one.

Anyway, this show is half Broadway, half rock show, and a whole lot of entertaining.  Several interludes are cut from the show and my personal thought is that maybe getting the rights to the samples used in those interludes were too expensive.  The opening track, containing samples of ""Finally"" by Cece Peniston, was really awesome and I was sad not to see it.  I'm taking off one star because I don't like a show to be altered or not fully captured when a dvd is released.

Overall, great show.  If you missed it, definitely go see her live when you can.",1319760000,73,1316,4.4375
4887219,5,B005SV9X22,"I too saw her show live twice and watched this on HBO.  I wasn't expecting the magic of the live show to come across on TV but it actually did!  Which once again proves what a stellar performing artist she is.  The odd fashion choices and other dichotomous behavior aside, this woman is incredibly talented and will have a long career in any kind of music she chooses whether it be pop or jazz.  I applaud her politics and hope more will listen to her message of love, compassion and understanding for all.",1319760000,110,506,4.408602150537634

4887236,5,B005SV9X22,"Four years later and I still enjoy this concert. Lady Gaga is great and the songs rock. So why buy the DVD instead of just downloading the songs?

Three reasons:
1) The costuming and staging are incredible and worth seeing.
2) The energy of the crowd is fun (the beginning is really cool; you can just FEEL the excitement)
3) The back up dancers! They are astoundingly talented and go full out for the entire concert.",1479427200,3,417,4.4868421052631575

4887273,5,B005SV9X22,"I saw this show.  The sound system was so loud, but clear.  I am aware that the Union requires a short break each hour and if you watch closely, she does talk a lot between a few songs

I know this is because her band and dancers need rest time.

Also, the real show was almost 3 hours.  We went to a local bar after the show and they all looked at us like the show rattled them, too!

Lastly, when she says the best part of the show is going home to sleep, she was right.  Apparently, 500 fans were outside her apartment but went to a hotel instead.  I don't blame her.",1422316800,,570,3.93859649122807

4887278,5,B005SV9X22,"Like reviewer K.K. before me, I'm also in my early 60's, straight, though LGBT friendly, and I adored Lady Gaga after watching this video. I've seen almost every act -- from the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Queen, Led Zeppelin, etc. -- and Lady Gaga is right up there with them all in this performance. I became a fan after borrowing a copy from my local library and purchased it on Amazon recently.

To me, Lady Gaga is a blend of Cher, Freddy Mercury, and maybe a little Jerry Lee Lewis, (as she plays piano AND electric guitar with her spike heels in the show), plus she can dance and sing like a 'Broadway Baby'. I saw her live this summer for her ArtRAVE tour and she sang and danced her heart out for two hours nearly nonstop, and she never lip-synched a note.

What I liked most about her is her interaction with her audience. She takes time to read letters from the crowd, and wears their gifts of clothing, plus spends time giving inspirational pep talks to those rejected for being ""Born This Way.""

Lady Gaga is a humble superstar. I expect great things from her, and this DVD is a great introduction to her many talents.",1418860800,2,1128,4.4396135265700485
4887279,5,B005SV9X22,"I wasn't sure if I'd get into this DVD. I'm in my mid 60's and I'm a straight man. Many of her fans are Homosexual, but believe me, you don't have to be to enjoy this Super Star. Lady Gaga is like the new and improved combination of Beth Midler, Cher and Madonna all rolled into one AMAZING PERFORMER!!  Her singing voice is absolutely Beautiful and she has the sexiness of Beth Midler, the flamboyance of Cher and the body Madonna would kill for and to top it off, she could out sing any of them!! I enjoyed ALL her songs and her lyric's. I'm Hooked on Gaga! I STILL have a high respect for the 3 women I compared her to and think that each one of them is a major talent, but after seeing Lady Gaga, she made me one of her Monster's!! She stands alone, What a BEAUTIFUL Talent!!",1417651200,9,779,4.125

This performance at Madison Square Garden was an absolute bore where she's more concerned about costumes than performance. She has already turned into Cher and at so young an age!  I just read an article that sums it up perfectly for me: ""At the most base level, without any of the accoutrements, Lady Gaga is an accomplished, capable, and passionate performer. Somehow however, that very rare fact has been lost, and possibly suffocated, beneath a menagerie of wigs and the oiled, fetishized bodies of her many dancers.""",1400630400,,679,4.794871794871795

4887311,5,B005SV9X22,Yes I like Lady Gaga but that wasn't the reason I gave it a five star. The beginning of the show was a bit slow but it picked up very well. She really entertains not just with music but with an on stage performance. She even got me interested in the songs I didn't care too much for. The imagination behind each performance was just brilliant. It was so good I want to see her live on her next tour.,1378857600,,399,4.0
4887312,5,B005SV9X22,"I bought this DVD out of chance because I had recently bought Lady Gaga's latest single 'Applause'. Taking a instant liking to the track, I later proceeded to buy her debut album ""The Fame"", her follow up EP ""The Fame Monster"" as well as, her most current full album release ""Born This Way"". Being a casual music lover, I always like the sense of expanding on songs by seeing them performed in a stage show. To me, it gives the song new life. Anyway, with that in mind, and having become addicted to the songs on each of the 3 albums, I bought the DVD. I have to say, to have not been a fan of Lady Gaga before purchasing 'Applause', I was immensely impressed with her capabilities. The show is captivating beginning to end and I won't spoil that by rambling off on any details and specifics. If you like pop music and concerts, this DVD is for you. All I'll say is, you WILL NOT be disappointed!",1378512000,4,896,4.3076923076923075

4887318,4,B005SV9X22,"There isn't much to say about Lady Gaga that hasn't been said already, but die-hard fans and new-comers alike to New York's avant-garde pop sensation will be pleased with HBO's treatment of The Monster Ball, Gaga's second world tour. It's campy, it's flashy, it will make you want to dance and it will make you understand why Gaga has taken the world by storm. You might think you've heard Paparazzi on the radio 500 times by now, but it's certainly a fresh experience at The Monster Ball, where she sings it as she's devoured by a giant light-up angler fish while wearing a dress that's half Wizard of Oz, half origami and 100% sparkly...seriously. Even Gaga's lesser known (but still fantastic) songs are treated with all the glamour and energy of her A-listers. ""Teeth"" is extended into a 10 minute raise-the-roof sing/scream-along, and So Happy I Could Die is performed in a dress that's...well...alive. The Monster Ball is one of those ""see-it-for-yourself"" experiences that a review can't do justice to.
As far as the Blu-ray transfer, both the video and audio are well up to par with what is expected. Expect to be able to count every sequin on-screen, or see every fiber in Gaga's radiant wigs.
I only deducted a star because this isn't exactly the completely concert. Gaga's actual tour was enhanced by primarily black-and-white interludes made by the photo-artists at SHOWSTUDIO. And boy, were they something. The starting interlude, a dramatic black-and-white countdown set to ""Finally,"" was probably the moment everyone remembers from their trip to The Monster Ball. HBO decides to cut most of these interludes and drastically shorten the others. ""Dance in the Dark,"" the intro song, is also shortened. This is acceptable for TV broadcast where time is a concern, but don't cheat people paying for the DVD or BD out of the full experience. They had the full footage available and decided not to lengthen the concert for home video release. This, in my opinion, is unforgivably lazy.
Other than the unfortunate editing, Monster Ball diehards will love revisiting Gaga's most famous tour to date.",1370995200,5,2106,4.985795454545454

She was doing a song called Boys Boys Boys ( I think) and there was a bunch of gay dances that made me uncomfortable to watch. Also, Lady Gaga went off on rants about gay people and a gay unicorn and I had to turn down the volunme for fear my neighbors might hear the gay rants and get the wrong idea about me.

First -- the people at HBO did a great job in editing the material -- the performance moves - it is dynamic, with great sound and color.  Their use of black and white for the interspersed black stage scenes was clever.  I have never really listened to Lady Gaga before this DVD.  Some of her music seems very good and her staging was great.  My only complaint is that this blu ray disk does not support ""resume play"".  Thus if you put the disk on stop or want to watch the program over several nights it will start over from the beginning -- this is a very irritating feature of many blu ray disks.",1337817600,5,691,4.157894736842105
4887353,1,B005SV9X22,"I'm more of a casual fan of a couple Lady Gaga songs ... I've never seen her live, so this HBO special is as close as I've gotten.  After watching it, I wouldn't bother going to one of her concerts.  She talks WAY too much throughout the show.  A story here and there is ok, often even appreciated.  But Lady Gaga goes on and on and on throughout the show, to the point of making me wish she would just shut up and get on with the concert.  The show itself loses something in the process of over-explaining everything.  I kept thinking, ""Please, let your songs speak for themselves!""  Pop stars, or any creative types, who can simply present their work and get a message across without all the exhaustive talking and explaining have something that Lady Gaga clearly lacks.  I found all the useless chatting a little amateurish.

Also, why on earth does she have to scream SO much?  By the third or fourth (or fifth or sixth) time, I was like, really?  The constant pleading for the audience to dance and scream and put their arms (or paws .. haha) up got annoying too.  Again, I think Lady Gaga would greatly benefit by limiting certain aspects of her live performance.

I wasn't a fan of her story concept either.  It was a take on the Wizard of Oz, with Gaga and her friends being lost and trying to find the Monster Ball.  It came off as way too silly and cheesy for my tastes. I especially hated it when she had her dancers asking where they were, saying they were lost, etc, etc.  Again, she did this a lot, and it got really annoying in repetition.  Maybe Gaga just isn't appealing to adults - I can see how a 12-yr-old might like this, but it's not for me.

All that being said, if you're a fan of her hits, you'll find most of them here, including Just Dance, Paparazzi, Poker Face, Bad Romance, and Born this way.  Some of the costumes are fun too - I especially liked her giant, moving white outfit for So Happy I could Die. It had these interesting wing-like things that opened and closed, creating a cool image.  Other costumes, like all the see-through rubber, was just cheap looking and pointless.

As for the dancing, Lady Gaga should leave that to her backup crew.  Let's face it - the girl doesn't have the moves.  She'd be better off letting her dancers do the cool choreography.  At points, it seemed like she was really struggling, and she just looked awkward next to professional dancers.

Overall, it seems Lady Gaga is genuinely trying really hard.  That's the problem with the live show, however - it should flow naturally and not be so forced.",1336176000,5,2568,4.433760683760684

However I have to admit that this was a bit of a disappointment especially considering some of the other blu ray releases by female artists in 2011. Three things about this that were disappointing to me were: The production value was missing  something--I really expected the scale to be larger and the design and costumes to just overall be more beautiful. The music seemed to be more centered around two dueling 80s guitars rather than driving dance beats, and above all I grew tired of Gaga screaming not only at the audience but me at home. So overall a bit of a let down.  I did enjoy Adele, Britney and Taylor Swifts blu ray releases in 2011 more by comparison.",1332201600,5,770,4.485714285714286

4887386,2,B005SV9X22,"Let me just tell you what it was that I did not like about this concert, she talked too much. It seemed that she had a long story almost after every song she performed. The costumes were ridiculous, what else can we expect from her. But some of the performances I must admit were fun to watch. I would have enjoyed this DVD if it wasn't for those long speeches she gave, some that had no relevance to the show. I get that fans that look up to her might enjoy hearing that stuff, but I just have to say that not everyone is interested in hearing a whole book on her adventures in Madison Square Garden. The only speech I remember, and did not mind was her sharing how she used to visit the arena and now is performing in it. The rest of it, I completely forgot and should have probably just fast forwarded through it.",1324080000,4,816,4.170886075949367

One of the things I didn't like from the editing is that they did not include the interludes. Those were essential to the show and it should have been included. One thing that I can agree on she does talk alot and reminds me of a church. But I like it. If you haven't seen her life then this DVD can work for you.",1323734400,2,424,3.941860465116279

I think her talent for writing is brillant. I love a singer that never says anything straight out but rather has people always wondering ""wow I wonder what this song means now""?

I saw her perform on this tour live twice. Two back to back nights. It was Fantastic! Her performance skills were jaw droppingly amazing! Her outfits awsome as usual and music track was great. She even features a song only able to be heard during her monster ball tour and nowhere else.

I give this concert dvd one star due to the way it was filmed. GOD AWFUL!!!!! Throught the entire dvd they were always focusing on the audience. Who wants to look at an audience while watching a concert dvd, especially knowing that it is Lady Gaga. We all want to see her outrageous outfits and how she performs. Let me say again I saw her perform live twice and the dvd shows no justice to her live performances. You hear more fan screams then her actually singing.

Even at 1080i, this is one beautiful picture! And I own many blu ray concerts and this ranks up there as the best. With all the different, brilliant colors there is no smearing or bleeding of the colors whatsoever. It is outrageously pretty to just look at!
The sound is presented in 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Tru HD and is very impressive in the bass and surround sound envelopement.
If you own a blu ray player and like Lady Gaga, do your eyes and ears a favor and get this on blu ray instead of DVD. You will not be disappointed.
Or like me, become a new fan with this brilliant looking treat.

4887396,5,B005SV9X22,"""The Monster Ball Tour"" by Lady Gaga is an entertaining dvd that features many of her greatest songs.  This collection shows Lady Gaga musically pouring her heart out in the songs with compelling artistic effect.  My two favorite songs in this dvd are ""So Happy I Could Die"" and ""Born This Way"".  In ""So Happy I Could Die"" she is wearing what appears to be an angel-themed costume.  Please understand that I intend to live a long and happy life. However, this concert performance of ""So Happy I Could Die"" resonated with me because the implied meaning appears to be about always finding ways to always look for happiness and have fun. ""Born This Way"" is her last performance on this dvd that sends a message of believing in one's own beauty.  I am glad that she chose ""Born This Way"" as the last track for her dvd concert performance.  This is because I definitely needed to be reminded of  the underlying message from ""Born This Way.""  I also like the bonus features included. For example, she is seen meeting  one  of her mentors backstage (Liza Minnelli).  The meeting proves to sentimental and uplifting as Liza Minnelli encourages Lady Gaga to continue going after her dreams.  In the bonus features, Lady Gaga is also seen embracing and appreciating two among many of her biggest fans.

4887402,2,B005SV9X22,"I went to this concert because all the hype around her, the concert estarts very promising, specially with all her fans screaming like little gils hitting puberty, anyway, she starst the show and while she's NO dancer, she makes the best out of her dance numbers, she plays the piano and she can sing, that's undenianble, but my complaint is that she talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, for a moment I thought I was in mass, listening to a sermon from the priest, she talks about the misunderstood (like her) the miscasts (like her) the ""poor girl bullied in school"" and how, in her concert all the freaks are free and they can be whatever they can be or want to be....
waht kind of message is that ? is she a proffesional victim now ???
this concert lacks energy, positive energy and her speeches are far too pointless and boring.
if you like her music, the best thing you can do is buy her singles, because she can barely dance and you won't be interrupted by her annoying screams, or yelling of the name of the city where she is performing every 10 minutes....",1322524800,10,1078,4.422110552763819

Perhaps Lady GaGa is a transvestite and we are all being deceived. I have seen pictures on the internet of what looked like male parts. I'm positive if the pictures are on the internet they must be true, :-) .  An operation would account for the missing parts of recent pictures, but when I look at the face I can't help to think it's really a man, i.e. ""Dude GaGa"", LOL.",1322265600,4,493,4.030612244897959
4887405,3,B005SV9X22,"Hardcore obsessive fans will like this, but the rest of you may be bored.  I had never seen a Lady Gaga show before and I had always thought of her as a talented artist and assumed that she was a fantastic performer with never-ending energy.  After watching this I discovered that she can't dance.  She's got a great voice.  She's a talented musician with some pretty far out costumes, however this show was on the dull side.  I guess I'm not as big of a Lady Gaga fan as I thought.  I know that the hard cord fans will be upset as they look up to her as if she were gospel and tend to be touchy if you discover you don't care for her.  They get very emotional and hormonal.  She's preachy in this show about being who you are which is fantastic, but I don't need to be coached up.  She shouts at the top of her lunges when she's speaking and its like nails on a chalkboard.  The music live was blander than the studio versions played on the radio and I watched this with a killer sound system.  I realized after watching this that she's successful because she's got a legion of followers that have low self esteem and need her to prop them up.  I get that, but I found her show to be mildly entertaining.  This isn't bad, but I expected something extraordinary from someone that is put on such a high pedestal.  Those same people will turn against her in the end as she ages.  The show is overrated.  Buy her album instead if you haven't already, but pick up the ""The Fame"" as the ""Born This Way"" album only has a few standout great tracks.  The rest is noise.",1322179200,,1561,4.202020202020202

4887407,3,B005SV9X22,"Ok.. to try to give this a fair review... we need to go back and look at the work of one Louise Ciccione born this way if you will in Bay City Michigan in 1958  if you have never heard of her you seriously need to look her up-in short all of this so music, dance moves, costume and hair trends, concert production, sex, controversial videos ,books and shock value -hell you name it- this has been covered originally at least 30 YEARS ago. So the question is weather or not the above artist being Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta is a legit artist/performer , tribute act, or plain copy cat riding off of other peoples success, genius and originality. If i really need to give evidence of what I am talking about I will name a few instances; for example: In Book form: Sex, In Live Performance on Award Show: MTV 1984 - Like a Virgin, Controversial Videos (just 2 named here) Justify My Love, Like a Prayer. Concert(s) (name em but I will just list 2 of the real thin here- no paws raised, so super fans just a Blond with an ambition to have a real FU attitude) The Blond Ambition Tour and The Girlie Show. Now the Media Appearances,Media shows (yep and some topless appearances at that) and everything else should be well known by now-forget about the media attention, rumors, scandals, controversies ect ect- they are legend now- been there and shes done it all-...Now If you have seen any of Madonna Louise Ciccones Concerts and then you the Monster Ball (if you have then you will know exactly what I am talking about/ for those who don't know-go ask some one about Madonna or better yet Google her name) How can you not come up with anything but an artist that is deliberately copying (and no this is no tribute act here..trying to image herself into a artist who has done all of this 30 years ago and still going strong. There is a difference of incorporating  musical influences and straight out being a tribute band or copying an artist.. (Prime Examples of this would be Jeff Lynne/ELO being influenced by the Beatles- Alan Parsons and Pink Floyd- The artist manages to capture their OWN Sound while their influences in their music showed through but copying or imitating  not a chance they found their own persona's- and there in lies the problem here.) Now to this performance itself (putting this in to cliff notes version) Production- been there and done that much better, Performance: talking way to much- I know its important to reach out to fans-but she over killed this and it did not seemed sincere-even so way over kill. Letting the Fans Know that they were in MSG, 5th sold out more than the F Bombs were said in Scarface... the Dancing - been there done that- The talking and lack of original production (see Sticky N Sweet and Confessions on a Dance Floor tours among others) makes The Monsters Ball lackluster performance from a woman who-if really with her beautiful voice, musical talent ( yep she can play the Keys and Bass) could really be something special instead of a clone of an Icon. There is no problem paying homage to your mentors and hero just be original while doing it and Lady Gaga if she put the effort in to it could just might pull it off..

I liked the below stage cuts but felt they took away from the onstage spectacle. I'd have preferred they'd been kept as a bonus feature. Maybe the DVD/Blu-Ray will be different. And I enjoy Gaga's music and her passion but sometimes she gets too ""preachy"" for her causes. I wasn't paying to listen to a sermon, I wanted to see her perform. She can be an activist all she wants on her own time, and I'd wholeheartedly support her there. Bottom line, the DVD/Blu-Ray will be well worth it, I don't doubt, but I'd probably skip over her speeches.",1321056000,7,804,4.513698630136986

When she finally played arenas with this tour, I found myself being less attracted to her. I was one of few that didn't fall for her whole ""I was bullied in highschool,"" ""I felt like a freak,"" and ""monster-like"" shpiel. Regardless of me not liking her as much, I attended one of the last shows of the Monster Ball Tour but unfortunately I found my phone to be more entertaining throughout it. Her show, which would have normally lasted an hour and half, managed to surpass the 2 hour mark because she would NOT SHUT THE HELL UP! I love when artists interact with their audience but she completely overdid it. Her show, which started as a theater show when the tour first kicked off, failed to translate into a bigger-venue show even with the huge budged. The show was very bland, uninspiring, and blas.

One of the main things that took away from the show was the too-obvious black&white-to-color film shots which were very&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madonna-Truth-or-Dare/dp/0784010501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madonna - Truth or Dare</a>. There are already way too many comparisons to Madonna so why do what's already been done? Gaga keeps pushing the limits but not always in a good way.

This was one of those shows where it would have been better to catch it live as it didn't translate too well on the screen. The directing for this dvd was horrid, unfocused, and headache-y. I cannot comprehend how the show managed to win an Emmy for Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special.

She constantly pumps up the audience and tells them to dance. The setlist is great! She performs all of the hits, along with the non-singles from both The Fame, and The Fame Monster. The show is basically like a broadway play, with Gaga and her friends trying to make it to The Monster Ball. The Costumes are Amazing, and there is plenty of them too! ;) The Bonus Features are A Photo Gallery, An Acapella Version of Born This Way, and Behind the Scenes Content!

SO IF YOUR READY TO HAVE SOME FUN THEN GET YOURS PAWS ON THIS DVD CUZ YOU WERE BORN THIS WAY!",1320796800,10,711,4.469230769230769

8485552,3,B005SV9X22,Lady Gaga Monster Ball Tour at Madison Square Garden is advertised as a Blu-ray + Audio CD . It did not contain an Audio CD when I purchased it. So I am returning it; the price is too high for just a Blu Ray concert.,1511481600,,216,3.8222222222222224
