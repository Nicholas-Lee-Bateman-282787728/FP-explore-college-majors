8359007,5,B002A6H70I,"I watched many of these Will Hay films when I was a nipper, and that's a few years or so ago now! I certainly enjoyed them then, and in watching them all again I have enjoyed them all over again.

I got this boxset as a Christmas pressie, and quite frankly it is one of the best Christmas pressies I have ever received, because I have got so much out of it! I still laugh heartily at the surprisingly fresh humour and one-liners that flow from all the films herein on this boxset.

Will Hay generally seems to be forgotten, when we think in terms of Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, the Marx Brothers and Charlie Chaplin, to name but a few of the great comedy stars and acts that were global stars all those years ago. Will Hay was very much a British star, and much loved at the time. But, as mentioned, he seems largely forgotten even by a chunk of the British public which is a great shame as personally I think he (aided by some others) was a comedy genius of the first order. When you watch these movies, you will hopefully, as I have been, be struck by the genuinely funny dialogue that exists between Will Hay's usually pompous and incompetent characters he plays, and the other characters, often Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt, who were two actors who appeared alongside Will Hay in many of these movies. The cheekiness and impishness of these two actors in many of these films will have you laughing, and the comedy in them for me is as relevant and as funny now, as they were when they were made all those years ago.

You get nine movies, and each movie is on its own disc, which is a nice touch I think. Not all Will Hay's films are here, but this is the best starting place if you want a good overview of Will Hay's career. There are no extras or filmographies or anything else, but this isn't so bad, and there are books about Will Hay and you can of course check him out online. A surprisingly talented and intellectual man all around.

My favourite films on the boxset are 'Good Morning Boys', 'Oh, Mr Porter' and 'Where There's a Will'. These for me represent Will Hay's comedic genius at their best, and are showcases for his talent and his ability to make people laugh. And they still are funny after all these years.",1370563200,3,2240,4.351674641148326
8359008,5,B002A6H70I,"I watched some of these shows many years ago and having the chance to watch the complete series I bought them all.  I don't think I have ever laughed so much, but you have to be very quick to pick up on the British humour, comments and quips.  I can recommend this collection to anyone and believe me you will not be disappointed.",1346544000,3,330,4.222222222222222
8359009,5,B002A6H70I,"When are such wonderful DVD collections going to be available for Region 1 players? Too often, the best of English or British classics are only formatted for region 2.",1343952000,3,167,4.793103448275862
8359010,4,B002A6H70I,"Will Hay was to England what Will Rogers was to America. Hay is long neglected here in the States, as a result his films are not as readily available as ther are in Europe. This box set contains some of his best films, and all are complete. The transfers seem to be from 16mm Original prints, and are a bit grainy but sharp. Get yourself a Multi Region DVD player and enjoy some dry Brit humor.",1341792000,4,394,4.197368421052632
