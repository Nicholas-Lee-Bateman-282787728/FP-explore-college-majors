2675244,3,B000JLIYRQ,"I doubt that many people went to see Kolberg on it's original release; most Germans were busy trying to survive and going to the cinema was not a top priority when the film was released on January 30th 1945, the anniversary of the 'Machtergreifung'. Troops in the besieged town of La Rochelle, France, were treated to a screening because a copy of the  film was parachuted in to raise their morale.
Goebbel's tampering with production of this film is highly evident. There are some good scenes but much of the film consists of heavy handed, morale boosting rhetoric, understandable on it's release but totally lost on modern day viewers. It remains, however, a curious period piece. Heinrich George is, as usual, excellent in the role he takes, in this case Nettlebeck, a local brewer who takes on the task of building a strong defence of the town, despite the incompetence of the local military commander Loucadou, played by Paul Wegner. Substitute the French for the Soviets and turn the clock back to the Wars Of Liberation and you have a film to motivate the German population against invasion. The only problem is that it was released too late!

As regards print quality, the slightly washed out Agfacolour in no way detracts from the viewing of this film. It is an excellent print, bearing in mind it's age and rarity. IHF have,as usual, done a fantastic job in print restoration. An enjoyable viewing experience as regards print quality though slightly boring as regard the plot.",1399939200,,1486,4.846456692913386

As i watched the Film on the german tv (ZDF 1976 ) and arte (2005) the quality was much more better, I don't no where IHF got this Film but maybe they will be asked the BUNDESFILMARCHIV for a better copy. Nice historic story but thats all. If you like to see real films with ns-propaganda look THE CHORAL VON LEUTHEN ,THE ROTHSHILDS or JEW SUESS.

2675247,3,B000JLIYRQ,"Reasonably good--for a propaganda film. . .

The strength of the movie is in the character of the mayor of Kolberg though his hysterical daughter and caricaturized son nearly undo his acting.

Not at all as bad as i would have expected from Goebel.",1344038400,,248,4.613636363636363
2675248,3,B000JLIYRQ,"To the foregoing reviews I would only add that Kolberg was and is in eastern Pomerania (Hinterpommern) and not East Prussia.  It is - at this moment in history -under Polish rule as a result of the ethnic cleansing of 1945. The Prussian queen (Luise) depicted was and is highly regarded by the Prussians both for her steadfastness against the French and her refusal to accede to her husband's Calvinism.

The Prussian officer who organizes the defense of the town gives a speech in the city square, towards the end of the film.  You will note that as he does so his voice changes - into that of Hitler.  Audiences of the time would certainly have noticed this.

The film was a pet project of Josef Goebbels, who diverted significant resources and thousands of troops (as extras) to its making.  One wonders what Gneisenau would have said about such trading of lives for glitz.

The modern battle of Kolberg, at the close of World War II, was a bloody and pitiless affair fought out, ironically enough, not only between German defenders and Russian attackers, but between Frenchmen on the German side (Waffen-SS Division Charlemagne) and Germans (Communists) on the Soviet side.

Since it accomplished nothing other than a weakening of the war effort, I would not rate this highly as propaganda, certainly not as highly as, say, Sieg im Westen or Alexander Nevsky.",1289433600,20,1363,4.819742489270387
2675249,4,B000JLIYRQ,"Dieser in Deutschland leider nicht kommerziell vertreibbare Film kann nun hier in deutscher Sprache mit englischen Untertiteln und digital remastered erworben werden. Er hat eine gute Qualitt und ist fr die damalige Zeit sehr aufwendig produziert. Amerikaner scheinen kein Problem damit zu haben, dass es ein sogenannter Durchhaltefilm der Nazis war. In der heutigen Zeit lassen wir uns ja auch nicht mehr von solchen Werken beeinflussen...auerdem kann man auch berall etwas hineininterpretieren, wenn man es mchte, ich kann den Film ohne Gefahr fr Leib und Seele empfehlen.",1211760000,35,574,5.609195402298851
2675250,2,B000JLIYRQ,"Made towards the end of the Second World War, ""Kolberg"" is a great eample of how Nazi cinema never really recovered from the exodus of stellar directorial, acting and production personnel upon Hitler's ascent to power in 1933.
Directed by the infamous Veit Harlan -who also helmed the vicious anti-semitic propaganda ""Jud Suss"" (1940)- ""Kolberg"" tells of the eponymous town valiant defence against Napoleon's army in 1806. The chilling overtones to the story clearly mark it as National Socialist propaganda.  For instance, the film labours the need of citizens to fight when they are threatened, and makes a triumph of the eventual accptance by Gneissenau that death is better than surrender.
Unforunately, these are the most interesting elements of the film. Generally the direction is lacklustre, the large cast sparsely used, and the battles over too fleetingly to really make any claim to being a war epic. Heinrich George's performance is the stuff of steely resolve one would expect, but the romantic elements are not handled well either by Harlan or the actors (including the generic stoic Aryan character played by Kristina Soderbaum, who was also cast in the superior ""Ohm Kruger (1941)).
Harlan's film only seems to spring into life when dealing with the wholesale destruction of Kolberg, filming the collapsing buildings with gusto. German audiences of the time knew all too well about destruction, but few ever saw the finished film, as it was released as the Nazis were on the verge of defeat. In reality, they didn't miss very much.",1204588800,6,1547,5.1146245059288535
2675251,4,B000JLIYRQ,"Kolberg comes under the notion of what I call classy propaganda.  Make no mistake, this film was a Nazi production. As such its interesting to see how they use history to make their point.  Kolberg was an actual town in what use to be East Prussia.  The film takes place just after the epic defeats of Jena-Auerstadt which saw the complete defeat of the old Prussian army by Napolean in October 1807.  There is a preamble dated later in 1813 in which Gneisenau, one of the great Prussian army reformers of the period has a spirited discussion with King Fredrich William III of Prussia.  The King is shown representing the elitest interests of Prussia, and is hesitant to declare a renewed war against Napolean who has just suffered his great defeat in Russia (1812).  Gneisenau argues that the King should lead his people, and rise the peasants as well as the nobility against the French.  F.W. III is relectant as he is more fearful of social unrest against established order, than of Napoleonic domination!  These were critical issues of the time in Prussia, which the movie uses as clever propaganda to urge the German viewers of 1945 to rise up in the same way and support the Nazis, i.e. Hitler!  This subtle distortion of German history makes for interesting play in the movie, which will use the same themes throughout.

The scene then changes back to Kolberg in 1807 with a Prussia still reeling from recent defeats.  The town is issued an ultimatum by the French to surrender, as most of the other fortified towns of Prussia had already.  Nettlebeck, the burgermeister of the town urges resistance and forms a local defense to resist the French.  This goes against the local garrison commander, who in typical old Prussian army style would rather surrender to Napolean than see the common people resist against him.  The film portrays the clash between Nettlebeck and the old Prussian commander with obvious overtones of the Nazi's appeal to eliminate such class distinctions.  Interesting stuff.  This is a propaganda film with some interesting character development and social/historical issues.

There is also reference to a Major Von Schill who rises to the defense of Kolberg as well.  Schill actually belongs to a slightly later period when Prussia thought of rising with Austria in 1809 when the later declared war against Napolean again. Many Prussian officers wanted F.W III to support Austria.  The king declined as he did not think the country ready to ally against the French.  Events were to prove him correct as Austria was crushed at Wagram in 1809, but the reverberations of these events in Prussia saw some like Major Von Schill take things into their own hands.  Schill was crushed by the French later that year, but the movie combines his actions with Kolberg.  Another historical inaccuracy, but interesting none the less.

Eventually the film shows the arrogant French move against the heroic town of Kolberg.  Napolean and his marshalls are shown in amusing caricatures of galic arrogance!  Funny stuff.  Although there is one accurate scene which has Napolean visiting the tomb of Frederick The Great and claiming if he were still alive they would not be there.  Quite true, and L'emporeur actual did say that. Marshall Mortier, one of Napolean's relatively competant generals conducted the actual siege of the town.

The battle scenes are a bit exaggerated as Kolberg suddenly seems to have legions of Prussian defenders to rain destruction down upon the French assault columes.  Again, this is slanted.  Portray the French as stupid and arrogant, the Prussians as noble and heroic!  Thats part of the fun of films like this, to see where the history becomes propaganda!  Still, the movie does not go too far off in comparison to more recent epics like Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"".

Kolberg resists against the fire and storm of French bombardment and the obvious comparisons to the allied bombing of Germany at that time is apparent.

There is an interesting scene showing a portrayal of the Queen of Prussia who is seen by the female heroine in the film.  The Queen, a celebrated beauty of the time, is shown as almost angelic!  What were the Nazi producers thinking here!  Napolean claimed her to be the only real man in Prussia at the time. Certainly she had more spirit than her weak husband.

Towards the end the film mentions the Treaty of Tilsit which saw a peace concluded bwtween the three emperors, F.W III of Prussia, Tsar Alexander III of Russia and Napolean.  Kolberg is still shown repulsing every French effort to take it, until suddenly the French decide to simply stop attacking because of the terms of the treaty.  This comes across as a miracle in the film, and no doubt the German audiance of the time was intended to see it that way.  By 1945 Nazi Germany needed a miracle in order to survive!

The film pays no attention to the fact that in 1807 the Tsar of Russia came to the assistence of Prussia, and fought two bloody battles at Eylau and Friedland against Napolean.  Nazi propaganda would not like to portray the Russians as helpful in any way!

Kolberg is an unususal work.  It combines history with propaganda in interesting way.  We know this is a Nazi production, yet there is a surprising amount of subtlety here.  Cinema students of propaganda can get a lot out of this film, but it is also worthwhile to those interested in the period it portrays, as well as the techniques of the film itself.  The DVD could use a documentry to explain a lot of these issues, and to describe the major efforts that were made to pruduce it.  Troops and material were used to make this film, which certainly were needed elsewhere!  Kolberg can be seen in several different ways.  As Nazi propaganda, as heroic resistance against tyranny (a bit ironic) and as just a good 1940s era foreign film.  Anyway the viewer wishes to see the film, they should find it worthwhile.",1191456000,53,5918,4.808910891089109
2675252,5,B000JLIYRQ,This is an excellent Napoleonic film about a Prussian town called Kolberg which resists the French even after The Prussian army is defeated at Jena and Austerdadt. Superb acting and superb battle scenes are in this film. Even though this is a nazi propaganda film their is no anti-semitism in the film. This movie is a must see.,1177891200,12,328,4.672413793103448

8151608,5,B000JLIYRQ,"A fascinating movie,commissioned by Hitlers Minister of Propaganda,Josef Goebbels,utilizing thousands of active German soldiers as extras,and only completed in a race against time,in the closing weeks of the Second World War! It tells the true story of the near miraculous defence of Kolberg in an earlier century,and it was intended to inspire the German people to even greater efforts as the Allied ring closed around the Third Reich in 1944-5.. Goebbels involvement with the film was intense,the resources that went into making it,particularly some of the speeches and dialogue which form part of the script,were clearly written by Goebbels himself,he identifies with the hero,who actually looks like him,or how he wanted himself to be seen,and it is on record that he wanted the film to be regarded by future generations of Germans as a personal epitaph.
For History and Movie buffs,this is a unique, must have collectible.  Do not be put off by the fact that the spoken language is German,the subtitles are excellent,and work well.",1498089600,2,1036,5.240963855421687
8151609,5,B000JLIYRQ,"Definitely an ""epic"" film.  Coming out of the WW II Nazi Propaganda Ministry with the backing of Josef Goebbels, the film utilized a tremendous amount of resources better used for the war effort.  German soldiers, large quantities of supplies, such as explosives, were diverted into the making of the film.

The film itself is stunning in its depiction of the classic battle/siege of the Napoleonic Wars.  Recreated period uniforms and equipment add to the presentation of stoic German townspeople, farmers and others in resisting the determined Napoleon and his army.  The acting style may off put some as being over the top and driven by modern motives, but it seems to be in keeping with other, non-German, productions.  The film, at this point in time, is mainly for history and film buffs.",1471910400,3,794,4.9772727272727275
8151610,5,B000JLIYRQ,An extremely interesting movie with great staging on the epic scale of War and Peace .Gustav Diessl gives a convincing performance and it was interesting to see him after I had watched him in the German version of L'Atlantide,1446249600,,225,4.794871794871795

8151613,5,B000JLIYRQ,I had read about this film in high school. Now I own it. This was the masterpiece of Joseph Gobbels  and Nazi film making. It is a very good film and worth viewing. Well acted and written. It was being filmed during the last years of WWII. It gives a German view of war and the push for victory. A quality production.,1433289600,2,317,4.112903225806452
8151614,4,B000JLIYRQ,"A Very Representative Epic,which mirrored the desperation of the Time in Which it was released; As the Last Motion Picture the Third Reich  put out,it was intended to Rally the German People to 'Continue to fight to the End Against Overwhelming odds', Which was depicted in the Film,set During the Time of Napoleon; It brings forth the Legends Surrounding Prussian heroes such as Gneisenau and von Schill, Who rallied A Small Town to Unite against the  French Grand Army,and to Endure the relentless Assaults by their Artillery; It is possible,Historical Facts were Indeed Manipulated for the Purpose of Propaganda.
The Film itself is Historically Signifigant,Due to the Fact that Several Whermacht Divisions,which were Needed more on Germany's Battlefields,were Tied up to Provide Extras for this Film;It's been Said that There were Actual Casualties(Accidental) in the Making of some of the Battle Scenes; Once they were Evacuated,Filming resumed Like nothing had happened; A testament to the Indifference the Nazis displayed to the Price of Their War.
Now,as for this Presentation,IHF Did A very good job in restoring the Quality of the film,Which is Pretty Much Shunned in Germany,Along with all other reminders of the Reich which was Intended to Last 1,000 Years; However,there is One inaccuracy of the Description on the DVD Case: It says the Film is 'Laced with Anti-Christian Symbolism and National Socialist Ideology'; Through Careful Study of the Film,I Have found No References to Christianity,For or Against; And,As many people know, the root of National Socialism was Anti-
semitism, and There were No References to Judaism,For or Against; The only Common Thread was The Unification of the Germanic Peoples Against A Superior Enemy, in Both 1813,and 1945.",1424131200,4,1768,5.333333333333333
8151615,4,B000JLIYRQ,"The story behind KOLBERG is a fascinating one. In 1943 when the tide of World War II began to turn against Nazi Germany, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels conceived the idea of a massive historical spectacle that would inspire the citizens of Germany to support the Nazis and fight to the bitter end. He chose an actual incident during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807 when the small city of Kolberg in East Prussia held out against French troops despite overwhelming odds. To helm this project, he chose Veit Harlan who had won Nazi approval by directing the notoriously anti-semitic JUD SUSS back in 1940. No expense was to be spared (the film wound up costing 8 million German marks making it the most expensive movie ever produced in Germany). In order to recreate this siege, sets were built, actual locations were used, and divisions of German soldiers were diverted from the various fronts to portray Napoleon's soldiers. This action inadvertently saved many lives and probably weakened German resistance.

The effect of all this expenditure and effort is clearly evident in the finished film. KOLBERG looks glorious especially as it was it shot in Agfacolor (Germany's version of Technicolor). The sheer number of extras used is a sight to behold most notably in the battle sequences in the second half of the movie. The performances are surprisingly good with Heinrich George as Nettlebeck, the Kolberg mayor, a real standout. It's also a rare opportunity to see one of German silent cinema's greatest actors, Paul Wegener who played THE GOLEM back in 1920, in one of his last roles as the incompetent town commander. His voice sounds exactly as I had imagined it. But Goebbels miscalculated. The movie took well over a year to shoot and Germany's fortunes declined faster than anticipated. When Goebbels saw the finished film, he was taken aback. The destruction of the town was too much like the real thing. Despite inserting speeches of holding out to the last man, the tone of the movie was too depressing and the film was never released publicly until after the war was over.

For years KOLBERG was available only in a truncated, washed out version with poor sound which is how I first saw it. I still have the old IHF video cassette. This newly restored DVD (also from IHF - International Historic Films) is a revelation. The colors are vibrant, the quality of the overall print is vastly improved but short of a true restoration, and the sound is a lot less harsh (it was probably never great to begin with). There are also greatly improved subtitles which are easy to read. Reportedly there is an archival print in storage with the F. W. Murnau Foundation but that print was not used here. KOLBERG gives us an insight into the German mentality of the time which is to obey without question even if it means extreme suffering and ultimately death. After 70 years it remains a fascinating artifact that is not any more heavy-handed than most American World War II films of the time and it still manages to impress with its attention to historical detail, its sheer size, and its sincere and committed performances.",1423008000,12,3126,4.841121495327103
8151616,5,B000JLIYRQ,"I am a big Napoleonic Wars history buff so I ordered this video to see what the Nazi representations of that time were like. I got far more than I expected. The whole movie focuses around the town of Kolberg which during Napoleon's smashing of Prussia in 1806 was one of the only Prussian strongholds to last the entire war. The film is not as far fetched as one would think (especially when comparing it to movies like ""Fury"") most of the characters are based on real people. There are however numerous signs of subliminal messages entered into the German audience at the time that WWII enthusiasts will pick up on immediately. Some examples:

1. Myth -The German populace (of 1813) marching singing patriotic German tunes to rise against their French oppressors. Gneisenau then tells King Frederick Wilhelm III to put every German under arms to defeat the French. Reason- Russians are invading and quick in 1944 so the Nazis want the Germans to unite to fight back. The real story in 1813 was that the Prussians were forced to conscript most of their recruits and many wanted to be rid of the French and were not pro-German per se.

2. Gneisenau in the film is portrayed as a young man in his 20s trying to fight the invaders. In reality he was in his mid 40s although he was adamant about repulsing the French.

3. Napoleon's troops abandon the siege thanks to the heroism of the German people. In reality peace was signed and the siege was called off.

4. During the siege of 1806 in the movie no mention is made of the Russian army. In reality it was the Russians that prevented Kolburg from falling since Napoleon and his best troops and commanders were battling them in Poland.

5. All the ""bad"" guys in the movie are portrayed as capitalistic, ""enlightened"" and ""new age."" ie not very Nazi...

Thankfully many of these points are made in the commentary which was overwhelmingly accurate. On top of all that the movie was pretty entertaining.",1416182400,5,1949,4.6347826086956525
