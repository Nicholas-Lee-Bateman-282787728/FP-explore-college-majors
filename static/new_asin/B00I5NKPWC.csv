6251444,5,B00I5NKPWC,I just received the blu-ray and cd package from Joe's web store yesterday. I listened to the blu-ray last night and it is fantastic. I already own all of Beth and Joe's albums together and this live performance is even better than the studio recording. Great job on the mixing and video. I hope to see them in person one day if they ever perform near where I live. I have seen Beth in a small setting near Washington DC and she was terrific. I'll be watching this many more times and listening to the cd on my ipod.  Don't hesitate to buy this live performance.,1395360000,9,561,4.2924528301886795

6251450,1,B00I5NKPWC,"I ordered this because the description said it was a BluRay, DVD and CD combo pack but only a DVD showed up and it was a gift. What a rip off.

6251451,5,B00I5NKPWC,GREAT SOUNDS!,1480291200,,13,6.0
6251452,4,B00I5NKPWC,"This is mainly a Beth Hart concert with Joe Bonamassa clearly in a supporting role only. As a result, it's not what I kind of expected...a Joe Bonamassa concert with Beth Hart as a guest vocalist on maybe two thirds of the songs. Joe only sings one on this disc. And that's fine, it's just that I'm a Joe B. fan more than a Beth Hart fan. Beth is a vocal powerhouse and a tremendous talent---no question there--but some of the numbers here are pretty boring, with a couple of them actually really hokey, like organ grinder music, complete with an accordion...ugh...one of the worst musical instruments ever invented...lol! I prefer full on blues rock with Joe tearing it up on guitar, and while his does not quite possess vocal chops on a par with Hart, his own concert DVDs like Red Rocks and Live At The Greek are more my style. Don't get me wrong, Joe gets plenty of spotlight on guitar here, featuring a solo on...well...ALMOST every song.

The music showcased on this DVD is more varied than what Joe delivers on his own aforementioned DVDs, so I suppose most people like that, but I'm more narrow-minded...lol!

Still, a great performance...Beth Hart does indeed knock it out of the park, so if you're a Beth fan, this disc is for you.",1479513600,8,1241,4.560538116591928

6251458,1,B00I5NKPWC,"This review is for the crime film ""To Love and Die in Amsterdam: and not the concert. Amazon in it infinite wisdom and reliance on computers have lumped the reviews together. I apologize to the fans of the concert.

In this MOVIE a crude US NARC teams up with an Interpol agent to tackle the heroin use in Amsterdam. While they are there they undercover a new drug made from fluid from the adrenaline gland from people scared and then subsequently killed. I liked the concept but the acting was bad. Cliche lines were spoken badly and with accents. The soundtrack was way too loud. The gunfire noise didn't come close to matching what was on the screen. Our US agent reads from a journal and it was horrible.

6251492,5,B00I5NKPWC,"ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!
This concert is an absolute MUST HAVE for every Blues fan or in fact anyone who appreciates great music and two performers who are at their artistic peak.
Supported superbly by a great band which includes Mr Anton Fig on drums , Carmine Rojas on bass plus a great horn section led by Lee Thornburg Beth Hart leads from the front with powerhouse vocals with the incredible Joe Bonamassa on lead guitar taking us on a musical journey covering some of the great blues standards plus some original songs by Beth.
The concert opens with the anthem Amsterdam Amsterdam! which is merely a prelude to what is to come.
Then Joe and Beth get the show rolling with a fantastic rendition of Them there Eyes , followed by the classic Sinner's Prayer a song where Beth's voice soars but then again there are many highlights to come including Can't let go , the Etta James penned Rhymes(Love that!) For my Friend(Blues/Rock at their finest) followed by the Melody Gardot classic Your Heart is as black as Night a song that Beth covers beautifully.
Throughout the show the musicianship continues to shine , of course Joe is arguably the best guitarist in the world right now and together with the driving bass of Carmine Rojas and the awesome drumming of Anton Fig we have a very accomplished rythym section.
Beth has a solo spot where she performs a great version of the Tom Waits song Chocolate Jesus which is a crowd favourite followed by her self penned Baddest Blues which is a great song which was inspired by Beth's mother and Anton Fig.
The remainder of the show really rocks with songs like Seesaw and Miss Lady the standouts.
Special mention must go to another Melody Gardot penned tune If I tell you I love you i'm lyin.
and the Al Kooper classic More than you will ever know a song dating way back to the very first Blood. Sweat & Tears album.
The encore is great as well with Beth belting out a great rendition of Nutbush City Limits and ending the show with yet another Etta James classic I'd rather go Blind.
All in all this concert either on Blue Ray or DVD is one of the best ever recorded especially when the band rehearsed for only three days and Anton Fig was only present on the last day.
A fantastic concert and if you are a lover of great artists like Beth and Joe together with a brilliant backing band(Horns and all!) then you WILL love this - in fact just buy it and you simply will not regret it!",1428537600,,2430,4.475225225225225

6251497,4,B00I5NKPWC,"One of my ""dream"" live concerts is with these two performing together but I'm still waiting for them to show up to my area of the big mud ball at the same time. I love both of their solo stuff and their two albums recorded together spend a LOT of time reverberating throughout our house and cars. I bought Beth Hart's ""Live at Paradiso"" recorded a few years back in Amsterdam and was blown away, and the three times I've seen Joe live are all ""live music highlights"" (first time he was a pudgy long haired young kid on a side stage at a festival and I became an instant fan). With all of that background I purchased this DVD expecting to be blown away one more time. First time through I admit I was pretty disappointed but I have now watched it in part or whole about a dozen times, and it is a very strong concert and very much worth owning.

But I'm still not blown away.",1424217600,2,874,4.171597633136095

6251528,5,B00I5NKPWC,"If youve read Boomerocity for very long at all then you, a) already know that Im a HUGE fan of both Beth Hart (see the Boomerocity interview with her here) as well as of Joe Bonamassa.  Suffice it to say, my opinion of either of them hasn't changed with the dual CD/DVD release of Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa Live In Amsterdam.

The recently GRAMMY nominated Hart and Bonamassa,  will deliver Beth Hart & Joe Bonamassa  Live In Amsterdam (2DVD/Blu-ray/2CD)  their first jointly recorded live offering. Beths amazingly powerful voices and Bonamassas legendary guitar abilities make this offering a true audio/visual treat. Recorded live at the historic Koninklijk Theater Carr in Amsterdam, the smokin hot performance blows you away with their performances of songs from the duo's 2011 debut album Don't Explain and the follow-up to it, Seesaw.  Youll hear incredible live performances of songs originally made famous by artists such as Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Billie Holiday, Tom Waits, Ray Charles, Donnie Hathaway, Lucinda Williams, Bill Withers, Delaney & Bonnie, Buddy Miles, Tina Turner, Slackwax, Melody Gardot, Nina Simone, and more.

This project was born from what Hart, Bonamassa, and Bonamassa's long-time producer Kevin Shirley call a ""crazy idea"" to record a catalog of songs in a way that recalls the days when a band recorded live in the studio with little or no overdubs; the days when the vocalist was happy when a take was done regardless of personal performance.

""What we're trying to capture is an era of reaction and spontaneity  something that was a great inspiration for me as a budding musician,"" explained Bonamassa. ""It's a bygone era in lieu of modern times and digital studio manipulation. We wanted to do the exact opposite of that for this live concert. There were no nets and what you hear is what was sung and played that night.""

Both Hart and Bonamassa were heavily influenced by these songs and the artists who originally performed them. ""We're doing these amazing cover songs and in doing them, and what's so great about doing them, is that it shows part of what excited us and made us want to become artists when we were young and just starting out,"" said Hart. ""You can see that a lot of this was an influence with me, and Joe, and the other musicians, you can hear it in the way everyone plays and performs. This was music that they loved, that touched them. And when you do covers, you get to make them personal. That was part of the goal  to make it like it's your story too. Otherwise how does it come across sincere? I think that's one of the challenges and it's very fulfilling if we feel like we're doing that."" The one-two punch of Hart's powerhouse vocals and Bonamassa's blistering solos both honors and reinvents the original recordings. Featuring 22 songs and over two hours of bonus and behind-the-scenes footage, the sonic pairing that critics everywhere are calling a ""match made in heaven"" are backed by the same world class band that kept the grooves going on both albums: Anton Fig (drums, percussion), Carmine Rojas (bass), Blondie Chaplin (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), Arlan Schierbaum (keyboards). This time out, their mighty sound is augmented by a horn section, with Lee Thornburg (trumpet and percussion), Ron Dziubla (saxophone and percussion), and Carlos Perez Alfonso (trombone and percussion).

Boomerocity favorites from this package are:

 The fun, crowd-pleasing Amsterdam, Amsterdam.  This tune gets in your head and won't let go.  The word fun comes to mind and you certainly get a sense that that is exactly what is taking place both on stage and in the audience.
 The bluesy and mournful I Love You More Than Youll Ever Know generated an infinite number of slaps on the repeat button. Beths voice is especially amazing as is Joes blistering guitar work.  Id almost say that this tune is worth the price of the entire package but Im saving that comment for . . .
 Id Rather Go Blind.  Ill say it right here and now:  Since we no longer have the great Etta James with us any longer, I can say with absolutely NO reservations that Beth Hart owns this classic.  The bar is sufficiently high enough that I doubt anyone else will ever be able to take this song away for her and call it theirs like Beth has.  Yeah, shes that great!

6251532,5,B00I5NKPWC,Joe rocks and Beth is one of the best vocalist of all time. Together they are phenomenal! I've seen them both individually but tough to see them together so I'll have to settle for the DVD until that day comes.,1402099200,,210,4.275
6251533,3,B00I5NKPWC,"This concert is literally Beth Hart's show. Joe professionally and politely accompanies Beth's strong vocals as she dominates the stage. I screened this DVD for several of my Blues/Rock loving friends,and the consensus was,""it's not a concert that will keep the attention of Joe's guitar virtuoso-loving followers.""",1401926400,2,315,5.723404255319149

6251536,2,B00I5NKPWC,"This DVD is all about Beth Hart, who IMHO is okay, but not even in the same league as Bonamassa. You get one tune w Bonamassa playing upfront, (hence the cover photo), on all the others tunes/songs it's the Beth Hart show, with Bonamassa in the background, - literally.

Disappointing doesn't quite cover it.",1401667200,4,308,4.703703703703703
6251537,5,B00I5NKPWC,"Beth is the most amazing soulful and passionate singer that I've seen and herd in a long, long, time. The band Joe put together for her is just killer. You can tell he's just loving it and having a great time hanging out in the back ground just playing his guitar with so much love for what he was born to do.

The lighting, picture and sound are absolutely superb!!! The ""Caveman"" Kevin Shirley's producing is impeccably masterful. How I would love to work and learn from this man, one of my all time hero producer's. I would cut his lawn for him for life if he would let me in his studio to watch & learn, since he's just 45 minutes away from me where I live in Long Beach California.

I'm hoping that some day that J & R Adventures will give us L.A. fans a chance to witness a live performance of this incredible dream band and not have to paddle across the Atlantic Ocean to catch a show. Bravo to all who were part of this amazing production, roadies, Soundman, lighting, guitar tech, drum tech road managers and Roy the Executive producer.

Peace-Love,

6251540,5,B00I5NKPWC,"These two perform well together, just no way around it. Beth Hart has an awesome voice that just grabs you and won't let go. Joe Bonamassa plays backup to her without overshadowing her but shines with his own brilliance at the appropriate time. A very good selection of songs that aren't so popular that everyone's done them and it seems too familiar but not so obscure you've never heard them before.",1400630400,,401,4.661971830985915

6251543,5,B00I5NKPWC,"This is a fantastic show, Joe and Beth Hart complement one another completely. I have the DVD with Joe B. at the Beacon Theather in New York and Beth sings a couple of songs on that one. On this new DVD she sings several songs that she wrote herself and many others too. This was a fabulous show, and of course, Joe is smokin' hot on the many guitars he uses for this show. I highly recommend this DVD , you won't be disappointed!",1399852800,,430,4.130952380952381

6251550,5,B00I5NKPWC,"Is there anything this guy touches that doesn't turn to gold? There just aren't enough accolades to go around. JB just might be the best rock and roll blues guitarist alive today. And Beth Hart...holy smoking hot sultry voice and performance. She is outstanding here. The band is tight and the songs showcase both of their abilities.

Quality wise it doesn't get much better. As usual for JB the sound and video are fantastic. HD audio gets 4.75 stars. Just a smidge low on Beth's voice for the first few tracks but really I'm stretching looking for anything wrong.

6251564,3,B00I5NKPWC,"Great music and musicianship; however, I found the performance almost unwatchable.  it's not just Beth's shaking and shimmying on stage during extended instrumental solos.  Take note of how many times the musicians appear to be playing to and smiling at the camera -- not the audience.  The visuals on the whole have a contrived feel and do not capture the ""live experience"" to the same extent as the two Royal Albert performances and the Beacon Theater concerts.",1397692800,2,463,4.987012987012987

6251567,5,B00I5NKPWC,"I picked up the Blu-Ray of Beth Hart & Joe Bonamassa Live in Amsterdam at Joes concert last Friday.  I am a huge fan of both artists, and I have both of their studio collaboration albums.  The short version of the review is that fans of their studio work with absolutely dig this.  If this is you, stop reading.  Put it in your cart and make the purchase.

Those of you still with me want a little more detail.  The concert on the DVD is one of five nights that Beth, Joe, and their amazing band played in Europe last year.  If you have Joes Tour de Force collection, you will be familiar with the rest of the musicians (except for Blondie Chapman on Rhythm Guitar, all of these cats appeared on at least one of the Tour de Force shows).  The performances are all top notch including Anton Fig on Drums, Arlan Shierbaum on Keys, and Carmine Rojas on Bass.  Lee Thornburg leads a great three-piece horn section to round things out.  Shierbaum reprises his bit from the Hammersmith Apollo show where he climbs up on top of his organ during one of his solos.  The horn section often dances when they are not playing.  There is plenty to see while you listen to the amazing music.  In total, the show is just under two hours long, and they hit most of the songs from the two studio albums.  The two items not from the studio recordings are Joes one lead vocal track Someday After Awhile Youll Be Sorry and Baddest Blues from Beths last solo album.  It is all great stuff.

But wait!  Theres more.  There are two lengthy bonus features with behind the scenes and interviews.  I loved these because it gives a glimpse of who these master musicians are.  It makes the experience much more personal than just watching the concert.  Whereas the Tour de Force bonus features were about Joe, these features are about how Joe yielded center stage to one of the most undiscovered singers in Beth Hart.  In turn, you hear Beth talk about how touched she was when she saw that her name was first on the mock-up for their first album cover.  I was a huge fan before, but Beth and Joe are rising toward the top of my favorite artists of all time.  In addition, there is a video from one of the other shows for Someday After Awhile Youll Be Sorry.  It features interesting split screen views showing multiple musicians at the same time.  Finally, there is a slideshow of photos that lasts about four or five minutes.  It adds up to the geek fans dream.  This is the apex (for now) of the Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa collaboration.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Repeat.  You won't be sorry.",1396828800,20,2562,4.385106382978724
6251568,5,B00I5NKPWC,"For me Joe Bonamassa isn't the guitar God he is to so many, I like him a lot, but I can't elevate him to Gary Moore status... but I'm getting off subject. What I do love about Joe is that he is adventurous , he is a super talented young man with the keys to the candy store and tries exciting projects and films them for those of us not lucky enough to be in the small live audience.  Just like his previous series of releases for his Tour De Force, this concert is filmed and presented as well as any hundred million dollar Hollywood motion picture, its just class and all of it first!  The bonus features are also heavy and there is a luxurious booklet that comes with it.  These are things major studios all skip to make more profit!

Now lets get to the program.  Joe's singing is his biggest blind spot for me in his talent arsenal, and this is obvious when he has a guest like Paul Rodgers sing and Joe just plays... so when Joe decided to work with Beth Hart I was thrilled.  I've been one of the few fans of hers in the US for many many years and even have a copy of one of her DVDs in PAL because it's not available over here.  As Beth says, this isn't her doing her show (she is a fabulous songwriter and performer) it is her being an R&B diva much like Tina Turner and Joe assuming the role of axeman band leader ala Ike Turner (with more chops to be sure).  The end result is true music, not computer manufactured sampled garbage, but fabulous singing, playing and goodness.... I wish young people would watch this and see what they are missing today!

If you like great , real , organic music.... Rock n Roll, Blues, Swing, R&B all mixed into a magical night..... order now!  Goodness knows I can't imagine Walmart or Target carrying this and where else can you buy music anymore?

HIGHEST RATING.... highly recommended, first class from performance to presentation.",1396569600,4,1879,4.3247863247863245
6251569,5,B00I5NKPWC,"Those familiar with Joe B's ""Live from Beacon Theatre"" on disc might remember Beth Hart who comes out and does a couple numbers with Joe and wows the crowd.  She gets full-on headliner treatment here with Joe and some of his usual companions backing her up.  Joe get plenty of licks in, but make no mistake, this is Ms. Hart's show.  And she won't let you down.

Hart is at her best when she takes on smoldering songs like ""Close To My Fire"" which really got my attention.  Ron Dziubla's sexy bass sax helps as well.  Melody Gardot's ""Your Heart is as Black as Night"" is another sultry show stopper, and seemed very personal from Hart's delivery.  Hart mentions Billy Holliday and drummer Anton Fig before she just kills ""Baddest Blues.""  Another well sung song is the sad ""Strange Fruit"" made famous by Nina Simone.  Bonamassa is at his best here with a beautiful lead-in and finishes with a mournful, dynamic solo.  Whew!  I also liked ""If I Tell You I Love You,"" another Gardot song which Hart plays with as a French cabaret singer.

There's little fault to be found but I thought some of the mood changing songs (""Chocolate Jesus,"" ""See Saw"" and ""Nutbush City Limits"") just seemed extrinsic.  Overall this is a near perfect concert, especially if you love the blues.  Hart and Bonamassa are a perfect match.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Like most concerts, it is film in relative low light but the camera does a good job with the detail and color.  I could actually read the brand name of Joe's watch.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise well done.  He horn section appears on the right and when they are featured, show up in the right surround channel.  Other instruments are properly aligned as well.  Well done.  Extras include ""The Making of: Live in Amsterdam,"" another take of ""Someday After Awhile,"" a photo collection and other short piece called ""Up, Down, All Around: Behind The See Saw.""  The set list is noted in Amazon's description.",1396569600,8,2015,4.614084507042254
6251570,4,B00I5NKPWC,Great concert.  Bonamassa and a great band combined with Beth Hart and a nice variety of songs.  The special features are also worth watching.,1396310400,,142,4.875
6251571,4,B00I5NKPWC,"i thought the show was ok...sound was great, editing was great, musicians were great...that being said, it was a little awkward watching beth stand around and shake and shimmy...i guess i am used to her also playing her keyboard (and occasionally a guitar) and not being stuck as the nominal ""girl singer"" who has an amazing voice, but doesnt have much to do whilst the men do their solos...that is really my only criticism...i am so used to her pounding her keyboard, and occasionally just standing and singing that it felt off...but, since everything else is great...you will just have to see for yourself...while i have enormous appreciation for their talent, i will say that the beth hart joe bonamassa albums ""dont explain,see-saw, and now live in amsterdam"" are not my favourite...but it is more to do with the song choice then the talent",1395792000,,844,4.868055555555555

6251573,5,B00I5NKPWC,"One hell of a show! Jubilant, exuberant, sensational! This is one of two gigs performed at the Royal Carr Theater Amsterdam in June 2013 in which this ensemble blew the roof off.  Lee Thornburg describes it on the bonus disc, ""It's a stomp and soul review like the old days.""  It is clear from the included interviews that Joe Bonamassa does not want to be ""one dimensional"" as he describes it and very much enjoys branching out into new genres. His side projects afford him the opportunity to do just that. His collaboration with Beth Hart is a powerful and dazzling one. The setlist includes soul, blues, rock, swing, americana and jazz.

Beth Hart's performance, stage presence and vocal prowess are nothing less than stunning. She brings a rock sensibility to the songs yet can also conjure the spirits of Etta James and Billie Holiday.  In addition she demonstrates here that she is reminiscent of the powerful female performers from the 60's and 70's such as Tina Turner and Janis Joplin. Joe Bonamassa's guitar is exquisite. The entire band is superb and creates the atmosphere and vibe of the evening. Paying homage to classic songs and musicians that have come before them, everyone on stage is having fun and smiling throughout the concert. The momentum builds until some of the most astonishing performances of the night are saved for the end: Strange Fruit, Miss Lady, I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know, Nutbush City Limits and I'd Rather Go Blind. All songs are from Beth and Joe's collaboration albums Don't Explain and SeeSaw with two exceptions: Beth performs her song Baddest Blues and Joe performs Someday After Awhile (You'll be Sorry).

Tasteful lighting is used. The sound is excellent. It is well filmed, directed and edited - no annoying rapid cuts in editing that can detract from the performance. Plenty of camera angles and close-ups of all the musicians including Joe's guitar skills.

There are generous amounts of extras (approximately 2 hours) including two documentaries with behind the scenes footage, interviews, rehearsals and the making of the concert film. It is nice to hear the admiration everyone has for each other and how grateful they are to be a part of this project. There is also an alternate version of Someday After Awhile and a photo section.

Beth Hart (vocals, piano), Joe Bonamassa (guitar, vocals), Anton Fig (drums, percussion), Carmine Rojas (bass), Blondie Chaplin (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), Arlan Schierbaum (keyboards), Lee Thornburg (trumpet and percussion), Ron Dziubla (saxophone and percussion), and Carlos Perez Alfonso (trombone and percussion).

This is one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The passion of Beth and the skill of Joe combined is like adding fuel to a fire. Very highly recommended!",1395446400,31,2777,5.021739130434782
