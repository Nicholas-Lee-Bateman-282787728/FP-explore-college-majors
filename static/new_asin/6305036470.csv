953872,3,6305036470,"....I think the first two DVD compilations are a bit better.  The first 15 minutes or so are amazingly unfunny.  However, once you hit the ""It's Great!"" sketch, things improve dramatically.  Also, some of the dialogue is difficult to catch, as these ladies tend to speak quickly, and with a British accent.  I would recommend the earlier releases over this one or ""Living In a Material World"" which was released at the same time as this one.",1065484800,6,441,4.688311688311688
953873,3,6305036470,"This video is drawn from the first shows the brilliant British comedy team French and Saunders did for the BBC--and it's much less polished, and much louder and in-your-face, than their later work. As such its not quite as good--but still, these were the skits that first introduced me to French and Saunders (years before the world had heard of them through ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS and THE VICAR OF DIBLEY) and made me fall in love with them. If you ever hear someone saying a propos of nothing, in a loud accusatory voice, ""She can't DRAW FINGERS!"" you'll know they've seen the famous skit they do here sending up the performance artists Gilbert and George--for one of their performance art pieces, French at one point is chained to a wall and has a wrecking ball smash into her (Here's Saunders on the event in retrospect: ""It was colossal, really, but I could never do it again..."") This show also features their great parody of ballet-dancers, where they explain what's the proper age to have your hair stapled in a bun to your head (""The best part of being a prima ballerina,"" Saunders explains, ""is having a pudding named after you""). The bits with them as loud overweight men are pretty obnoxious and dislikable, but this gives you a chance to see these two masters of comedy in utero.",1011571200,3,1289,4.682819383259912
953874,5,6305036470,"Yes,I bought this tape on Dawn French's strength alone...She's every bit as funny as any Jim Carrey and Gorgeous to boot. I first noticed her incredible chameleon-like comedic talent on the BBC series ""Murder most horrid"".And on this tape she is,again,in fine form...changing from girl to dirty old man to Elizabeth Taylor...She knows her craft...very well. She deserves more recognition here in the states...buy this tape and you'll see!",1008028800,,438,5.36231884057971
953875,5,6305036470,"Just wanted to say how much I enjoy watching these French and
Saunders videos.
These are quite obviously two of the brightest people on the planet.
Just such funny concepts with such a poignant ring of truth.
Thank Heaven above for such hilarity !
So talented......so creative....sooooooo funny.
It's the perfect antidote for what ails you.",1003363200,2,340,5.089285714285714

7881293,5,6305036470,"These gals ARE Absolutely Fabulous filling time till Joana Lumley comes along.  Jennifer Saunders & Dawn French ""F&S"" are a very talented duo and if you love AbFab, this is a MUST as are all their French & Saunders ""F&S"" comedy acts to compliment AbFab so you can see where Dawn French's role on AbFab orginated from!

7881295,1,6305036470,"This is the worst dvd I have ever purchased, I love Dawn French and most bbc movies but this is a jumbled mess of nonsense, wasted money.",1405123200,,137,4.111111111111111
7881296,4,6305036470,"I bought this DVD because my wife and I enjoy Dawn French in the Vicar of Dibley, and they advertised these DVDs on the Vicar of Dibley DVDs.  They are pretty funny and I would recommend them if you like Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, or British humor in general.  Two caveats though.  First, there are no subtitles on the DVD.  Our 50-year-old hearing is not as good as it used to be and especially with non-American accents, we like to have the subtitles on the screen to help us with the dialog.  No luck here.  Second, some of the humor, just like in the Vicar of Dibley, refers to British people that are unfamiliar to most Americans, politicians and such.  So some of the humor goes right over our heads.  That aside, the DVD is an enjoyable watch.",1253923200,3,755,4.420289855072464
7881297,2,6305036470,I am a French and Saunders fan and this recording of various TV shows they did in Britain is very amusing.  I received it quickly after ordering it through Anazon.  Can't think of any problems.,1231372800,,193,4.485714285714286
7881298,1,6305036470,"I love Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, but I guess an entire tape of them together, well, I just couldn't take it.  I think they're were certain parts that were OK, but on the whole it was awful.",1231286400,2,198,4.2105263157894735
7881299,4,6305036470,"These are the two funniest people ever.  However, this DVD is from an early, formative time and the material is little uneven. That said, it's still French and Saunders, and there's nothing better.",1175040000,3,197,4.96969696969697
7881300,5,6305036470,"i too think this is a great F&S DVD. this doesn't have any real movie parodies which may explain others' less-than-positive reactions, but you won't miss them at all. (the exception is an absolutely fantastic rip of the piano, and there are some parodies of movie stars inc. jennifer as a great loopy liza minelli and a short bit w/ dawn as elizabeth taylor on cat on a hot tin roof). there are some really classic moments here, inc. a series of sketches where the two are schoolgirls, some of the best living room sketches, and some great 80's parodies inc. a kid's TV show called ""it's great!"" and a pet shop boys and bangles parody. there are some misses, like the bits w/ the two lechers gets a bit old, but overall this is a very worthwhile collection.",1140566400,2,757,4.453237410071942
