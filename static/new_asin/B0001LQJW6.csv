8410239,5,B0001LQJW6,"Very interesting, poignant, and often fun. Hearing Life Magazine photographers, who have taken some of the most influential photographs of our time, tell their stories about the photographs and about themselves is fascinating. Sometimes you can see their deep emotional connection to the pictures, other times you laugh at their anecdotes. Overall, worth watching for anyone.",1176163200,6,375,5.714285714285714
