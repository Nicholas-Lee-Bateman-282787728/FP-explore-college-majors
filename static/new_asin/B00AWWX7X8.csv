5524801,4,B00AWWX7X8,"I never saw this series back in UK when I was a kid. Wish I had, it looks good after all these years, storylines taken from events of the time, narrated by the ""Newspaper Editor"" it tells of the Sheriff of Tombstone doing what Sheriffs do, and doing it well.
The actors look like they believe the parts they are playing, and enjoying it.
I haven't watched the full season yet, but already hope TMG release the rest. Though I am still waiting for Bronco, Sugarfoot, Colt 45 Black Saddle then I may be satisfied.
I loved settling in on the sofa with my toy gun, snuggled into my Dads big chest and helping those cowboys, so these DVDs are not only entertaining, they bring back good memories of me and Dad spending some time together, [and he looked like John Wayne]",1365379200,13,764,4.387323943661972
5524802,5,B00AWWX7X8,"Couldn't wait to get this DVD set in the player.  The picture is pristine and the show and quality is top notch.  I look forward to Season 2.  The price is right which makes it an ideal buy.  I don't know how many seasons the show was on TV but I will buy all seasons.  I was a teenager during the time Tombstone Territory appeared on TV so I missed out on it doing other things but appreciate the opportunity to see it in glorious black and white rather than the ""snowy"" screen available during those early TV years.",1365379200,5,517,4.181818181818182
5524803,5,B00AWWX7X8,"This was my favorite western as a child and I have searched for quality DVD versions to watch it again. This is the DVD set that I and so many other fans have been looking for! They have obviously been copied from the film masters, as advertised. They may actually appear better on today's televisions which can render film images with higher resolution than the televisions and broadcast capabilities of the 1950s, when the show was broadcast. The images are crisp and with no defects. I hope the vendor will make the other two seasons available so I can complete my collection and enjoy all these classic episodes. The writing and the acting are superb and the stories are timeless. The show was filmed in the 1950s but has withstood the test of time surprisingly well.",1365033600,23,771,4.676470588235294
5524804,5,B00AWWX7X8,"Love this show, it was one of the best westerns ever on TV and the closing song was the added bonus that made it unforgettable. I watched this show every week as a kid and looked forward to the end when the song came on. I would have to place it in the top 5 of all time best western theme songs. I also have the complete set but will definitely be buying this release and hopefully the rest of the seasons. I highly reccommend this series, 2 great leads with some great guest stars and a fantastic closing song.",1364342400,15,512,4.13
5524805,5,B00AWWX7X8,"This was my favorite series from the fifties,but Pat Conway, though an excellent actor is a forgotten man. I have always enjoyed Westerns and the interactions of Clay Hollister (Conway) and the editor of the Tombstone Epitaph Harris Claiborne(Richard Eastham) were fun and heartfelt. The stories are as fresh today as they were in the fifties. Both men could act,something that was missing in a lot of westerns at the time. Being a horsemen myself it is a pleasure to see that Pat Conway was an excellent horseman riding easy and bold in the saddle. His intense style worked well as the young, incorruptible and fast gun sheriff of Tombstone and Eastham as the mellow  editor who gives him advice. You can see many of the stock western badmen in these episodes Robert Foulk, Myron Healy and John Doucette as well as a heartbreakingly young and beautiful Dyan Cannon in ""the Injury"" (unfortunately not on season 1) the series also has the usual locations for a fifties series, Iverson Ranch, Bronson Caves, and Melody Ranch.
A must for fans of classic westerns. I for one am glad to see Pat Conway and Richard Eastham walk the streets of Tombstone again.

Just got the remastered copy. Well worth the money. Very clear and excellent editing. When Timeless Media said ""pristine"" they meant it. I have the eBay copies which are good but it is a pleasure to watch the pilot episode ""Gunslinger from Gayleville"" without the hops and skips of the poor editing from KXTX . Everything is sharp and in focus. Clay Hollister Lives!  One can only hope Timeless will release the remaining two years.",1361836800,47,1587,4.763636363636364

And a bit more mature in  it's approach than the allegedly-adult (but definetly-juvenile) ""LIFE AND LEGEND OF WYATT EARP""  The only ""flaw"" to this series is the somewhat corny  theme-song.  but then again, you might like it.  Produced by the same people who gave us ""Bat Masterson"", I believe that you will find this series to possess the same high-quality in story and production-value.  And BECAUSE this film is coming to you DIRECTLY from AMAZON, you can.be assured that it will arrive on time and in better condition than the dvds that you buy in most stores.

5524819,5,B00AWWX7X8,"I have always been a fan of 50's TV.
It's too bad so many of those shows,
were lost because no one at the time had the foresight to preserve most of these historic gems for future generation . Fortunetly a few of them did survive
And thanks to Timeless Media Group
Many of them are still available to watch
and enjoy again.
For me some of the best shows of the era. Were made by ZIV television .
Tombstone Territory was among the best
of them. Unfortunately you can only find the 1st season. But a complete 91 episode set comprising all 3 seasons of the series was issued through Walmart .
Earlier this year. But they got snapped up
Before anyone had a chance to buy them.
Walmart has no plans to restock them.
And if you try to buy it on eBay, You'll pay 100.00 bucks or more, for what Walmart sold for 20.00 . So all of you who loved this great old serise, Please pettion Timeless Media Group to re-issue the
Complete  91 episode set , And urge
Amazon to aquire it.",1405641600,,967,4.171122994652406
5524820,5,B00AWWX7X8,"This has to be my favorite television western, and I've seen just about all of them from the '50's and '60's. I was very young when it aired, and did not recall any of the episodes, but the theme song could never be forgotten. I was able to get the limited release of the entire series over the past Christmas season and have seen just about all of the episodes. It's a magnificent series. Pat Conway was born to play the role, and Richard Eastham is just as impressive. Their chemistry on screen is the glue that holds your attention throughout. The quality of the prints is exceptional. Sharp contrast, almost pristine, nothing washed out, unlike The Tall Man collection. Each episode looks like it was filmed yesterday. A word about the directors. Keep an eye out for the episodes directed by Walter Doniger. What a talented filmmaker, the way he so effectively positions the players and props to creates multiple levels of perspective that add great depth to the scenes he films. Just wonderful. William Conrad also directed a number of the episodes. I cannot recommend this series highly enough.",1398816000,2,1100,4.7643979057591626
5524821,4,B00AWWX7X8,"I had not heard of this program, and was thrilled to uncover a modest treasure.  There are much better TV westerns from the period, but if you are like me and want to not have to see Bonanza, Big Valley, Gunsmoke and the others over and over, it's fun to watch something new.  The characters, sets, and stories are all pretty much standard fare from the period, but that's probably what draws you to the TV Western.  The theme song is nightmarishly catchy and simple.  I really don't like it, but find myself humming it every once in a while.  Pat Conway as the sheriff comes off as a Captain America type - which adds to the fun.  Enjoy.",1396569600,,638,4.319327731092437
5524822,4,B00AWWX7X8,"I didn't follow this series regularly when I was a kid. It was a ZIV production and I always thought of them as a second tier production company. But having bought season one, filling out my western DVD collection, I am finding that I'm very much enjoying these episodes. On a par with the Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and I hold that series in high regard. Picture and sound quality are very good. About half way through the episodes and will be on the look out for season two, if and when.",1395532800,,492,4.24468085106383

5524828,5,B00AWWX7X8,"Didn't expect much above average but the videos are first class. Not the third generation schlok VHS dubs you get from some sets. Just like they were broadcast yesterday. And that theme song with every episode-'Whistle Me Back...'-makes it perfect. Takes me back to those days when I sprawled in front of a 17"" BW tv to watch those old westerns of yesteryear. Waiting for Seasons 2 and 3. Don't make us wait too long! Now if they can just do the same for 'Science Fiction Theater'! Yeah!",1388707200,,487,4.545454545454546
5524829,5,B00AWWX7X8,"I went to the local Wal-Mart to purchase what I thought was the first season of Tombstone Territory. Much to my surprise, it was the complete series from MGM/TMG for only $19.96. Yes, I was happy. There are 91 episodes on ten discs and each has the programs listed on it. I've looked at random episodes and they appear from very good to excellent in quality.

I remember this program from my youth, especially the theme song. The episodes I've watched so far were made very well with thoughtful stories and good acting. Pat Conway plays a no-nonsense sheriff and a man of action. Having each program based on an article from the ""Tombstone Epitaph"" newspaper (and narrated by its editor, played by Richard Eastham)  only makes them more interesting. Also, this series was made to be as authentic as possible with historians used to verify facts. Tombstone Territory is not as well known as some of the other TV westerns. However, I've found it to be just as good. A real nice addition to my classic TV collection!",1387065600,3,1013,4.653631284916201

I was just a babe when these first aired but I'm enjoying them now that I know of them and have them.  Good stories and though it's not historically accurate all of the time - So What?!!  Enjoyable stories just the same.  I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Westerns and this series will be a great addition in anyone's collection; right along with Cheyenne, Have Gun Will Travel,  Rawhide and the other western I received with Tombstone Territory, Yancy Derringer (see my review for that).",1386460800,,631,4.589285714285714

5524833,5,B00AWWX7X8,I wondered if this series would ever make it to DVD...Loved it as a girl and am glad it is now available. If you like the old westerns - you will love this one. Now waiting for the rest of the series to come out on DVD. Great video.,1382054400,2,232,3.7551020408163267
5524834,5,B00AWWX7X8,"Tombstone Territory is great TV series. I remember reading review on this show some time ago and I agree with that writer Pat Conway is great actor and  it is unfortunate that he is a forgoten man, because he is a good actor and without him in the lead role I do not think the show would have been as great.

I notice that the show ran for three season. As soon as the other two seasons are released, I will  buy the DVD's and I think  that other fans of the show will do like wise.

One seperate matter I notice that Warner Brothers have released the first season of Sugarfoot, I would like to purchase this show but Warner Brother's(WB) do not ship to Australia. If Amazon is able to secure this show at around the same price as WB's sells it for I will purchase this TV series also.

5524840,2,B00AWWX7X8,"let me start by saying i'm a collector of tv westerns. my goal is to have all of them especially 1st episodes.
this show is not very good. weak story lines and not many big name guest stars, and a very bad theme song.
Pat Conway is a real life rancher who is a good horseman and roper with a fast draw. as an actor he over acts to the point of
looking stiff. with bend arms and his hands inches from his guns at all times he looks robotic. they had a historian to verify the
accuracy of the show, but it takes place from 1881-86 but no mention of the earps and clay hollister was not the sheriff.

Well, I can report that the picture quality is excellent and it is clear that the re-mastering/restoration of these old black and white episodes has done a very good job - so, potential buyers will certainly not be disappointed in that regard.  I do like the male narrator voice that chimes in at various times during each episode saying things like ""Tombstone 1889"" and then you get the normal dialogue between the actors - highly recommended for Western fans.",1370995200,3,663,4.756521739130434

5524855,5,B00AWWX7X8,"I was absolutely flabbergasted to find that Tombstone Territory [season one] had been released on DVD. Airing from 1957-60, this ZIV production pretty much was lost in the shuffle of TV westerns that flooded the airwaves. After 2 seasons in primetime, a third season aired in syndication, and then the town too tough to die lived on in re-runs until B&W shows were dropped by most stations.
Up until now, the only episodes available were bootleg copies, most in very very poor condition. Now with this release it looks like they were made yesterday. Timeless has dipped into the MGM library for almost pristine prints.
Have Gun had Palladin, Gunsmoke had Matt/Kitty/Chester and Doc, Bonanza had the ""boys"", Big Valley had Victoria.......Tombstone had excitement, stories and Zivs moody background music. The lead, Pat Conway as Sheriff Clay Hollister, is an underrated actor. Plus he looked good. Wearing a gun on both hips, black hat, black boots and string tie set him apart from most of the 1950's oaters.
I would have lost my house on a bet that this show would be out on DVD. I beg you to buy this show because not only will you love it, but maybe there is hope that Timeless will continue with seasons 2 and 3. Then, after the Rough Riders is released on DVD, I can die happy.",1365984000,17,1282,4.676991150442478
