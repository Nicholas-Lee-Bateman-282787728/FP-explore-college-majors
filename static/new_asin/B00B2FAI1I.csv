8561407,5,B00B2FAI1I,I love Eric Roberts. He is a great actor and he played his part like a champ,1472860800,,76,3.5294117647058822
8561408,5,B00B2FAI1I,"Talk about a movie with twists & turns. I love Eric Roberts and the rest of the cast was great. It takes place inside a Church, so that turns out to be a shocker. Follow the movie and see how things change from Police work to a man of God trying to help others. But, some people don't want help, preferring revenge. I only wish Eric had a bigger role, but just the same, I really enjoyed the movie. I wasn't sure just how it would end, but alas, it's good! An inspiring movie.",1414368000,,476,4.074468085106383
8561409,5,B00B2FAI1I,One of the best movies on FORGIVENESS I have ever seen!  Excellent MINISTRY TOOL!  Perhaps a little slow moving and intense for younger ones.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BE SHOWN TO ADULT BIBLE STUDY GROUPS EVERYWHERE!,1378771200,2,214,4.888888888888889
