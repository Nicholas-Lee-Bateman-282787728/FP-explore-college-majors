3482501,5,B001B43IVW,I really enjoyed watching this mini-series. It reminds me some of the great McCleod's Daughters. This show is really too short and could be continued into a really good series.,1246233600,3,176,4.9
3482502,5,B001B43IVW,"Very fast shipping, great price for the shows. I am a huge Mcleods daughters  fan and I was recommended this series It has more than meet my expectations. You will not be dissapointed in this seller or the show",1240790400,6,210,4.384615384615385
3482503,5,B001B43IVW,"simply put just watch or rent it, it is worth your time. If you are like me, it can not be made into a regular show soon enough. If you love McLeod's Daughter you will love this!",1235779200,9,178,3.8378378378378377
3482504,5,B001B43IVW,"I stumbled upon this series in late 2008 in the new releases section on Amazon.  The two user reviews here convinced me that this would be a perfect birthday gift for a friend of mine - and it absolutely was.  After she enjoyed the series, she let me borrow it.

The actors are excellent as is the story.  The 6 episode story arch is paced perfectly, each building on the prior installment.  After watching one episode, I couldn't wait to watch more.  My only regret was that I wanted the series to continue (it wraps up perfectly, while still leaving room for future installments).

Since borrowing the set that I bought as a birthday gift, I have purchased my own copy of the set, and given yet another one as a Christmas present.  I'm a bit surprised that this series hasn't gotten more attention - again, I stumbled on it by accident.  The quality, in every respect, makes this set more like a six hour feature film than a television mini-series.  It captures the beauty, lonelyness and isolation of life in a very accurate way that I think most people can relate to.

I hope this gets aired on PBS at some point because this quality series deserves a much larger audience.  I'd sure love to see another 6 episodes.",1235433600,30,1219,4.490909090909091
3482505,5,B001B43IVW,"Excellent story of Aussie vets living in the rain shadow during a drought.  Australia - where the men are men and the women go make some tea.  Well worth watching, even so.  Almost makes me want to move back downunder.",1235433600,3,218,4.4
3482506,5,B001B43IVW,Rain Shadow is an excellent drama about two very strong women who learn to live and work together.,1233014400,,98,4.5
3482507,5,B001B43IVW,"Six episodes are not enough.  It's that good. The views of the rain shadow country alone make the viewer desire to experience the ruggedness, even overcome the hardships.  This Australian drama was filmed in southern Australia, rain shadow country. A rain shadow is an arid region on the lee side of mountains allowing little rain to cross, like Nevada. It creates a setting as tough, as desperate, and as determined as the veterinarian Kate McDonald living in fictional Paringa.

Dr. Kate (widowed 10 years) is played by Rachel Ward. Ward turns from her more recent directing and writing activities to lead the cast with her superb acting portrayal of a woman who has taken charge of her life caught up in extreme harshness located an arid region and a struggling community.  Driving into Paringa, is the newest arrival in a long string of attempts to secure an assistant, in the person of Dr. Jill Blake (Victoria Thaine).  Her own extraordinary performance adds to the off-again, on-again, personal and professional relationship between the two vets that have a community animal health situation to deal with as well as their own secret lives.  It's a powerful combination as intriguing as the interacting lives of the rest of Paringa's citizens.

Move aside, James Herriot, make room, as Rain Shadow has rekindled interest in a country veterinarian's life.  Dr. Jill is new, not nearly as tough as Dr. Kate McDonald--YET! And the viewer is as confused about the history and personality exchanges of Paringa as Jill. The community seems to have it's own definitions for integrity and law. For example Larry Riley's (Gary Sweet) unexplained wealth in a struggling location. And, why were so many other newly arriving vet assistants driven off so fast?

This is a contemporary wild country, gritty, survival-of-the-fittest story; not altogether unlike some old tales of the US Wild West. Rain Shadow is gripping drama that, although it ends satisfactorily, it leaves itself open for a reunion and an additional series. Hopefully writers Tony Morphett and Jimmy Thomson will comply.  I for one would like to spend another six hours with the lady vets' adventures.

Viewing ladies will like the assertiveness (to the point of big, bad, boldness) of the pair of female Paringa vets. Men will wonder if they would have the fortitude to stick it out, like the courageous young and old men of the Rain Shadow. At what lengths would you go? At what point of endurance would you fold it in? IN REALITY, how much longer can you wait to see this stunning story of those determined to live through the drought, persevere, and conquer the outback?

Each of the 6 episodes of Rain Shadow is equal to a 5-star movie.",1222992000,54,2703,4.916483516483517

3482554,2,B001B43IVW,"only got through the first 3 disks with much effort and patience......very slow moving and very little plot, very little character building. if you have been spoiled by McCleods Daughters as I have been then don't waste your time with this.",1411257600,,240,4.878048780487805

3482557,4,B001B43IVW,"Excellent, atmospheric series (I'm a veterinarian - they got one major medical element wrong, but oh well)... fantastic score by Aussie group ""The Audreys"" (album Between Last Night and Us). Yes, some edging-to-melodrama in some of the ancillary characters but definitely enjoyable watching - unlike other reviewers we loved the pacing and the centrality of the countryside. 2 main characters excellent.",1373328000,,403,5.622950819672131
3482578,5,B001B43IVW,One of my most fav actors does a great job in this series-I am hoping for a series two. lesson learned about sheep farming in Australia.,1372464000,,136,4.269230769230769
3482579,3,B001B43IVW,The pace of the series was slow and a little boring. There were several mysterious aspects that could have been played up a little more.,1367020800,,136,4.48
3482580,5,B001B43IVW,I enjoyed watching Rain Shadow.  It focuses on the rural life and the struggles ensued there.  Also the struggles of the veterinarians trying to helping other farmers survive in rugged conditions.,1366934400,,196,5.290322580645161
3482581,5,B001B43IVW,I enjoyed thi series about two women in the outback of Australia! Very Good Movie Set.! Give it a Try!,1366156800,,102,4.15

3482583,5,B001B43IVW,"This drama centres on two strong women. They are vets in the Australian outback who face drought, complex human relationships and sick animals. It's wonderful to see a full six-episode series focus on the interactions and actions of two female leads - played superbly by Rachel Ward and Victoria Thaine. It took the first episode to tune my ear to the Ozzie accent, but, once tuned, I rather enjoyed the twang. If you're looking for an unusual story line set over six episodes, this series is for you.",1356566400,2,501,4.704545454545454
3482584,5,B001B43IVW,"Personally I highly enjoyed Rain Shadow and have actually watched all the episodes twice.  It is about a young female vet that goes out to a small remote town in Australia to serve an apprenticeship with a local, hard nose, female vet.  The ranches in the area are on the dry side of the mountains (e.g. rain shadow) an experiencing a long term draught.  While the entire series is slow paced, I found the DVD did an amazing job in developing the characters and depicting what a tremedous struggle it is for the local ranchers and their families.  Not everyone will enjoy this series, but all I can say is I did.  I think anyone that is interested in ranching, especially in arid areas, will enjoy Rain Shadow.",1355875200,2,710,4.515625
3482585,4,B001B43IVW,"This was a pretty good movie.  Some of it was lame.  I guess I was wanting it to be as good as Mcleod's
Daughters and it is not.  But I love any movie set in Australia.",1354060800,,168,3.611111111111111
3482586,5,B001B43IVW,Interesting series about life in the Australian countryside. Makes you appreciate your own life style. Life is difficult in these parts where rain is rare.,1345766400,,155,5.24
3482587,2,B001B43IVW,ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I COULDN'T FINISH WATCHING THE SERIES. I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND TO WATCH. THEY COULDN'T FINISH EITHER.  I SENT IT BACK AS A TRADE IN.,1345507200,,152,3.75
3482608,5,B001B43IVW,"Borrowed this from the library several months ago.  Enjoyed it very much, especially the music.  Bought the DVD for my sister who was recovering from surgery and also the group's CD because we enjoyed the music so much.",1345420800,,219,4.7368421052631575
3482609,5,B001B43IVW,This is a series that I did not want to end.  I hope there will be a Series Two released soon.  Rachel Ward is her usual marvelous actress and the supporting role by Victoria Thaine was excellent.  This is about the hardship of a Vet in the Australian outback whose hard attitude makes it difficult for any assistant to stay on and work with her.  When a new assistant comes from the city she is determined to stay and begins to love the work in the outback and understand the situation.  Hoping for Series Two soon!,1330992000,3,516,4.333333333333333

3482613,5,B001B43IVW,"I'll never move to Australia because it's the closest thing to living in the middle of the Sahara desert; sounds like real fun, huh.  Nevertheless, the complex story line, interesting characters and videography makes this excellent entertainment; probably could've withstood about Six Series of Rain Shadows.  Sure hope someone wakes up and creates more series.",1298678400,2,361,5.545454545454546

3482616,4,B001B43IVW,"I very much enjoyed viewing this character study of the growing relationship between the two main characters.  The Aussie landscape is beautifully shot. The shot of a car driving on the long, long Aussie roads was a bit overdone...should have had a little more variety on that one, but that is a minor flaw.  Buy it and enjoy.

8281882,5,B001B43IVW,"This is my all-time favorite mini-series.  It's hard to believe the characters in the story are actors!  They absolutely become and LIVE the people they portray.  I've never been so ""attached"" to ALL the members of a cast.  The portrayal of life in southern Australia as both magnificent and desperate is altogether convincing.  The scenery is both beautiful and solemn. As an animal lover, the story has special significance to me. I watch ""series one""  at least once a year and always wonder why there is no ""series 2,3,4 etc"". I thought maybe Netflix just doesn't carry it, but I can't find it anywhere.  I wonder what happened?  If you really enjoy getting engrossed in a story and it's characters, be sure to watch this series!",1448409600,3,732,4.753968253968254
