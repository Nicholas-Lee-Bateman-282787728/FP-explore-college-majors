It's been a while since I've last seen it, but just seeing the cover again already has me humming the carefree opening, and remembering the many scenes of suspense and heroism, and all the extremely memorable characters.

I simply cannot recommend this show highly enough, it's a true masterpiece that takes you on the most amazing adventure dedicated to animation, and offers the most fulfilling ending I've ever seen.",1319414400,,530,5.080459770114943

Plot: Mankind was facing the fires of extinction. Super-magnetic weapons, far more destructive than atomic weapons, caused half the world to be wiped out in an instant. The Earth was seized by great tectonic upheavals. Its axis was twisted. The five continents were ripped completely apart and sank into the sea...
Twenty years later, life exists on only a few remaining islands. One of these islands is `Remnant Island', where a boy named Conan lives with his grandfather as the only two survivors on the island. They think they might be the only two humans still alive in the world, until a girl named Lana turns up unconscious on the beach. Lana is being chased by the huge technological city of Industria, and they soon capture her again. Conan is determined to get her back, and sets off on the adventure of a lifetime.

There aren't any true anime fans who haven't at least heard of the great works of Hayao Miyazaki. That's because his films have such pure, three dimensional characters and situations, and such innovative and unique fantasy settings, that they've practically become the prime example of what anime is, or at least what anime should be. His films have set the criterion for existing trends in the industry, and started several new ones. He is considered a master of storytelling, not just in the anime world, but in all of filmmaking. So where did it all start? Where did this amazing artist's creative vision first show itself? For the answer, look no further than Future Boy Conan, which is the first series Miyazaki ever directed. Because this series reaches such a level of excellence, suspense, and fun, it's soon apparent that only Miyazaki could have directed it.

By this point, it hopefully goes without saying that this series is, in every way, an excellent experience. When you aren't having great fun watching this adventure unfold, you're cringing on the edge of your seat in suspense. The plot work is excellent, excellently combining the fun with the serious and symbolic for a multi-layered story that anyone can enjoy a part of. At the end, this series is ultimately a cautionary disutopian sci-fi tale (funny, so are later Miyazaki films Nausicaa and Laputa), but you couldn't tell it from other parts of the series, which often times appears as more of a fun adventure between two friends, with even a slight fantasy trend. That's what makes the storyline not only work for anime, Miyazaki, and sci-fi fans, but for anybody who can enjoy real storytelling. Because right as the series has been going one direction for long enough, it won't fail to change course at the drop of a hat (or episode ^_^), while keeping the same amazing characters.

Which brings us to the characters of Future Boy Conan. They're some of the most amazing, memorable characters I've ever seen in an anime. That's because they never fall flat, ever. Even though they're all formed from some of the most fundamental archetypes of storytelling, you're always discovering new layers of all the characters, regardless of how major they are, or whether they are good or bad. This is because, even though they are based off fundamental archetypes, they are all identified as human characters, and humans aren't in black and white. That's why, every time you think you've figured a character out from front to back, they'll do something that, although unexpected, somehow fits with the character's personality. This, along with the engaging plot, makes for an amazingly fun, watchable show that you'll want to watch at an amazing speed.",1296518400,3,3636,4.870759289176091
