I am lucky, I have a Grad Prix level teacher who took clinics with Mary Wanless, and first suggested the book from her. But basically, this book will help you at minimum to better communicate with your trainer.
Another aspect, is why not to benefit from somebody's knowledge and skills instead of spending years of practicing wrong riding.
Most of the DVDs and books concentrate on training the horse, not training the rider. This DVDs will help you improve your position on the horse. Wary Wanless somehow has an ability to really explain how to ride properly, use the examples that will help you feel what you need to feel in your body when you ride.",1446595200,,752,4.5777777777777775
