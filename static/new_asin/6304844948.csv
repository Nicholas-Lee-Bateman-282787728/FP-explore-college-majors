933564,3,6304844948,"I was so excited when this movie came out. I like the big ideas we see in science fiction, and I wanted to find something great in Ripley's clone. I'd been disappointed by Alien 3 (or, Alien3), and I knew that the idea for this movie was to go with the weird and wonderful (and successful) kinds of concepts that were in Dark Horse Comics' Aliens books at the time, and also to give fans a rip-roaring ride of Aliens-loose-on-a-spaceship with military members, mad scientists, a synthetic with a mission, creepy mercenaries--an adventurous tone bringing the series back to the blockbuster thrills of Aliens.

But the movie does not click. In Alien 3, especially its superior Special Edition, we see a lot of humanity, however bleak, and the horror of a new, much faster and more vicious Giger Xenomorph. We meet Dillon, a noble man with a criminal past who approaches all problems from a no-nonsense, religious perspective. His beliefs don't stop him from kicking serious butt when necessary. Even Clemens, Andrews, Morse and a few others hold a viewer's interest. But Alien: Resurrection is every bit as bleak, hopeless, gloomy and depressing as its predecessor, yet this time there's no humanity or characterization to be found anywhere, except maybe in Call, the android who understands the threat the Xenomorphs pose. The Ripley clone is actually kind of a muttering Bride of Frankenstein. We care about Ripley, but that doesn't guarantee we'll accept her staggeringly uninteresting clone. The real Ripley's sacrifice in Alien 3 only prolonged the birth of a new Alien Queen. Anyone who's seen this movie knows how the long-awaited Queen makes the one in AVP look worthy of Cameron's original. The ""Newborn"" human-Xeno mix is hideous and pathetic and has a baby-poop-yellow color that ruins anything outstanding about the creature design (and there isn't much). Gore is in abundance, fast but still gratuitous. The mercenaries are drab and evil; who cares if they live or die? Who needs all the one-liners in this misguided attempt to restart a film franchise? When the Ripley clone, #8, discovers the seven failures that preceded her, she shows Ellen Ripley style emotion. This scene could have been iconic, but nothing is explored. Gigeresque horrors are done away with through the use of a flamethrower. When I tuck myself in bed every night, I ask the Almighty to please make sure there's never another flamethrower used in an Alien film. When I watched Prometheus I thought Janek should have just shoot a giant flamethrower at the Juggernaut heading for Earth. Star Wars has its lightsabers, and Alien has its flamethrowers. I can't believe someone didn't cremate Shaw's dissected corpse in Alien: Covenant. Lazy writing!

Alien: Resurrection will probably entertain you in some ways. A few of the Alien scenes are memorable. The Queen is horrible, and might have been downright hellish if not for the arrival of the ridiculous Newborn. The Ripley clone has some good scenes, as does Call. But the atmosphere of this movie is heartless. Alien fans loved the casts of the first two films, and many liked the misfits of Alien 3 in spite of themselves. Alien: Resurrection looks like a science-fiction epic but feels like an absurd European art movie combining with a pointless American sci-fi horror vehicle that should go straight to home video. It is the work of a fine director, talented writers, a solid cast, but it never ""feels"" right. I have watched Alien 3 (both versions) dozens of times but nothing induces me to revisit A:R in the hopes I'll finally like it, finally find something intriguing in it. Twenty years after first seeing it, I like it less than ever.

The only way an Alien movie is ever going to work again is with a cast that viewers care about. I like Shaw (written out like Newt and Hicks in A3), David/Walter, Janek and Tennessee in the new Scott prequels. Covenant almost made me miss the Last Engineer from Prometheus, a pasty-looking baldy-headed ""god"" who acted like a rampaging King Kong in a pressure suit.

A final note:  There is no male protagonist whatsoever in this movie. The Ripley clone and Call are so ambiguous, we don't cheer for them as we have for Ripley or Vasquez. Every character in this fourth Alien installment is either rotten, evil, or empty. I seriously believe this affected the box office returns on a movie that looked to be a return to form.",1503014400,,4406,4.885026737967914

933636,2,6304844948,"In the future cloning might work this way, but for now it's impossible to use a host animal's blood to clone a parasite (with different DNA) living inside the host.  The process does also not result in a clone having the memories of the host.  But that's the premise of this film and the conceit used to ""resurrect"" Ripley (and the alien living inside her) after she self-immolated in Alien3.  It's two hundred years later, but the tech hasn't changed much and people seem to be as stupid as ever, sticking their heads into holes and walking around blind corners. In light of Prometheus and Covenant, though, it is interesting to note the android Call's unilateral secret mission to seek out and destroy the cloning program, a future foil to David, who created his own breeding program to perfect the xenomorph.  When Ripley asks her why she's doing this, Call says somewhat sheepishly that is how she was programmed.  In other words, at one end we have a rogue android who perfects a parasite designed to kill humans, and at the other a rogue android dedicated to saving humans from this same parasite.",1496275200,,1103,4.694300518134715

933707,3,6304844948,"A good example of great ideas executed poorly.

The plot was definitely there, equal amounts of humor, action, and horror that made James Cameron's Aliens the classic it is today. It even had really fresh and interesting ideas at many point, particularly with Sigourney Weaver's character and her hive-mind connection to the Aliens themselves.

Unfortunately, a lot of moments felt rushed or out of place. Halfway through the movie, I forgot what the plot even was until I was conveniently reminded a scene later, as if they knew that was going to happen. The acting in this movie range from meh to decent. Wynona Ryder's character seems....well.....out of character, and you'll understand why three-quarters of the way in. Weaver herself did well as usual and her portrayal of the Ripley clone was refreshingly frightening in the beginning, humorous, and utterly badass. She was one of this movie's highlights. The Aliens themselves were also handled well. I could just see that this movie was actively trying to be better than it was. It was noticeable with every line of weak dialogue. So, yeah, I give it 3.5 stars for it's potential and what entertainment it did offer.

But wait, there's a monster on the escape spacehip! One last battle, monster flung into space, the end.

Fun if you enjoy seeing gore and slime, which is enough for some folks. Sigourney Weaver always a treat. Hybrid monster doesn't look that frightening.",1488326400,2,615,4.913461538461538

If you're like me and loved the visual style of City of Lost Children (also directed by Jeunet), and you like the Alien series in general, this film will please you. One thing that separates this movie from the other Alien movies (aside from the visual style) is that this movie kind of gives the aliens a bit of intelligence so that they aren't just brainless killing machines that love to breed.",1487376000,3,600,4.504587155963303

The first thing I love about this movie is you get to see how intelligent the Xenomorphs (Aliens) are when they kill one of their own to escape and then use a torture devise on one of the guards.
The part of the movie I dislike, I was hoping they would close the Ripley chapter, but alas they did not
The acting in this movie is on point, really enjoyed the bond that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Call (Winona Ryder) form, and I for one enjoyed Ron Perlman in this movie alot.
This movie does not give you the claustraphobic terror of Alien, or Alien3 but not the thrill ride of Aliens either, I enjoyed the darkness of this movie and the way they give you a glimpse of what Weyland-Yutani is up too as far as experimenting with the Xenomorphs.

934169,5,6304844948,"This movie gets a bad rap! I know Joss Whedon hates it, but it's almost certainly more interesting than a faithful take on his script. Whedon has done some great stuff- I like Firefly and the first Avengers movie quite a lot- but his mannered, joke-heavy style of dialogue would crash and burn a movie like this had it been directed the way he wanted.

Instead of a Whedon movie, we get something far more bizarre and fascinating. Back from the dead through the miracle of cloning, Ripley's DNA has been mingled with that of the xenomorph, which, are, as usual, being studied for their scientific and military potential against all common sense, she is now stronger, stranger and far more callous. This is a phenomenal role for Sigourney Weaver and a genuinely original take on a character that could have become rote and boring.

The crew of bandits who come to the ship to sell, uh, materials to the scientists, are much more recognizable as Whedon characters, but are plenty dark enough to fit the moral ambiguity of the film and not seem jokey and one-note. Ron Perlman is pretty great.

Also it's really great to look at.",1468540800,,1126,4.648241206030151

I didn't like Alien Resurrection when I saw it in the theater because for me, the Alien franchise means leap out of you rip your face off loved ones dying in agony mind-splitting terror, not jokes written in by the creator - God Bless Him - of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which I loved (all seven seasons of it).  It just didn't work to have a wry comedian write a vicious soul-ripper movie, is all.  Now these many years later, though, I already know it's tongue in cheek (until Ripley pulls it out that is), so I can enjoy Ron Perleman looking in at the flames engulfing Ripley Attempts 01-07 and commenting, 'What a waste of good ammo. Must be a chick thing.""  Watch this as terror - humor, and you'll enjoy it.",1465603200,,889,4.3053892215568865

934255,3,6304844948,"I've watched this movie 3-4 times over the years and just got done re-watching it in a kind of Alien movie watching binge. On the whole, I still love the original Alien series, but if this ends up being the final installment I would have to consider it a disappointment.

Alien I and II are undoubtedly two of the best sci-fi films ever made, the 3rd installment was a pretty huge disappointment and was seemingly the end of a trilogy. In Alien: Resurrection Ripley is basically recreated in a petrie dish to battle the aliens one more time, but with a twist. I won't spoil it any further but the storyline is a real reach in terms of believeability, even for science fiction.

So, what's wrong with this movie? For the most part, it is the premise itself along with the excessive gore and lack of character development. The screenplay itself is not all that bad. In fact, it resembles the attitude of Aliens much more than Alien 3, due to its inclusion of some well-written one-liners and moving the plot (as it is) along at a pretty steady pace. For the most part, the acting is excellent. Pretty much everyone brought their A game to their respective characters. The special effects were also significantly better than Alien 3, with the possible exception of some underwater scenes.

The key thing missing in this film, especially as opposed to the first two, is... Hope. It is a bummer of a movie with humanity being just as much the enemy as the aliens, perhaps even more so. It leads to what has to logically be a depressing ending, which is pretty evident from the start. The horror moments are mostly reduced to pure gore this time around and there are few, legitimate ""scary"" moments that were the hallmark of the original film.

I would also be remiss in not mentioning the annoying number of continuity errors that pop-up throughout the film. Characters are alive, then dead, then alive, then dead again. In general, this movie got a quite sloppy editing job that did not seem to get fixed in the DVD or various Blu-Ray editions. I am not the kind of person who puts movies under a microscope in regards to little things like continuity errors, but in this movie it got to the point of being quite annoying.

All in all, it's an entertaining movie, but definitely not up to the standards of the original movie and its sequel. If you've seen the first 3 movies and were hoping to find some kind of closure in the story line, you won't find it here and considering how much backstory there is to this picture I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch this movie without having seen the original three.",1464393600,,2608,4.564102564102564

934452,5,6304844948,"Some time after Alien Resurrection was released in 1997, I watched it with some trepidation, having been scarred by the horribleness of Alien 3. Now, in 2015, I re-watched the fourth film and found it much better than I remembered (in part because I recall what a big star Winona Ryder was at one point in time - nostalgia!!).

While this film is marred somewhat by the comic book character-ness of the gang of six mercenaries that enter the film, as well as the weird-for-the-sake-of-being stylishness of the crew of doctors in the film, the writers do interesting things with the concept of genetic modification, and mess around with the plot, fairly torturing our gang of six with all sorts of attack/trap permutations. There's a wild suicide scene at the end too when a doomed human does something totally insane, and the new Ellen Ripley is also amazing as she doesn't yet know whether she wants to be bad, or simply badaas.

The opening scene is grotesquely cool, there's the computer Father (as opposed to Mother in the original), acid blood, the doctor's crazy face-off with the alien, wheel chair acid, and the crazy escape pod slaughter. Elgyn's new aashole, and repeated lines like ""I don't trust anyone!"" Funny ""souvenir"" gag, horrible vacuum cleaner death. ""Earth, man - what a spit hole!"" There's grotesque chamber of horrors scene that must be seen to be believed, and great innovation in the underwater scene. Wow! Cool facehugger attack, and the scene where the alien turns the tables with the deep freeze gas blast button. The plot of the film is very similar also to the middle part of Star Wars, when the dwindling crew is racing to escape the Death Star. ""I thought you were dead!"" ""Yeah, I get that a lot."" Especially in a film about resurrections, I guess!! Ron Perlman gives another man a kiss at the end - crazy! The film is grotesque and gory with lots of gore and guts and freakishness with about 20 graphic killings. Great creature effects, though - conventional xenomorphs, another queen mother, and a totally new alien!

It's interesting how every other Alien film follows the fame formula of sorts: odd-numbered films involve a single xenomorph and a motley gang of unarmed misfits, while even-numbered films involve multiple aliens, trained military personnel and tons of artillery (AND flamethrowers!!).

The DVD I saw had hardly any bonus features - a trailer of 1:20, and a ""featurette"" that mostly contained scenes from the film and was really just an extended trailer (4:00).

Incidentally, I understand that there are alternate versions of the Alien Resurrection DVD out there, including one with a second, longer cut of the film that shows the crew landing in a ruined future Paris at the end of the film, as well as a two-hour ""Making Of..."" documentary, that would probably be cool to watch too...",1449360000,,2838,4.855371900826446

934510,2,6304844948,"""Alien"" will always have a special place in my heart, simply because it was the first ""R"" rated movie I saw in theaters.....and it scared the hell out of me. I was way too young to watch that first film!! ""Aliens"" was a groundbreaking sequel, in some ways, it's almost as great as the original film. While not a huge success, and it does have it's flaws, I still enjoy ""Alien 3"". It tries to recapture the creeping terror of the first film, and while not always successful, it still has it's moments.

""Alien: Resurrection"", the 4th installment in the series....the installment that burned, buried and sprinkles salt over what could've been a lasting franchise. Where Ripley was once a strong character, someone to root for, with ""Resurrection"" she's turned into a joke. Her strength, now more physical than mental, is played as a punchline. The Alien creature, once a symbol of mindless aggression and something to be feared is turned into a slimy messy, pumpkin-headed creature that's badly in need of Kleenex. And, what may be most criminal, a fantastic cast is completely wasted; Sigourney Weaver, Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman. Also wedged in here is Winona Ryder who is simply toxic in every scene she appears.

Joss Whedon's overly complicated script turns is just a mess. A Ripley clone, space pirates, medical experiments. It's all a convoluted mess and takes the long route in getting a group of people trapped in a ship with some Aliens. The movie is dull, the F/X are awful, and the entire plot just makes no sense.

I highly recommend the first two films in this franchise, and if you want more, give part 3 a spin. But I highly recommend you stay away from this stinker.",1446768000,,1679,4.723549488054608

He definitely has a different style, especially the visual stuff that leans heavily towards the organic - but his style is just to quirky for the alien franchise - in my opinion.  Winona Ryder is horribly miscast.  I've never been a fan of her ""acting"" but damn, she can't even make a convincing android, and that's saying something.  The guy in the wheelchair, can't remember his name but he is probably one of the oddest-looking / acting guys you're likely to see in an alien movie & he just feels totally out of place.  He's in a few other of Jeunet's movies so I guess he is a favorite.  Both him and Ron Pearlman were in City of Lost Children.  Anyway, the movie's not all bad, there are some very cool things going on.

Some of the ideas in the movie are REALLY strange, and I won't lie, is the reason I've given such a good rating. No spoilers here, but they create a new type of alien that is supposed to be humanlike. They introduce a Ripley that is not quite....Ripley. And my favorite part, they attempt to link Ripley to the Aliens. I think Joss Whedon and the writers tried to take the story in a very interesting direction, but it wasn't fully fleshed out for whatever reason (it was early in Joss' career, or the producers hamstrung it, or they ran out of time, who knows).

934709,3,6304844948,"""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997) takes place 200 years after the episodes of ""Alien 3"". Lieutenant Ripley is dead. Using her alien-contaminated DNA, a team of scientists decide to create a Ripley clone in an attempt to reconstruct the alien species. After cloning a near perfect impregnated Ripley, they extract the alien from inside her for studying and decide to keep the Ripley clone for further testing. The new Ripley has several unusual characteristics; abnormal strength, concentrated acid for blood, and she appears to have a close kinship to her alien offspring. The aliens, on the other hand, are kept within securely built confinements, constantly being scrutinized by the scientists. These new breed of aliens are more intelligent and when left alone, they execute their escape plan. It is up to Ripley and the crew of the newly arrived ""Betty"", which includes Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) and the fearless Johner (Ron Pearlman), to try to destroy the blood-thirsty predators that are roaming within the ship.

Despite having a silly plot, the special effects and performances in ""Resurrection"" are what saves this from being a total failure. Sigourney Weaver is exceptionally good although her Ripley this time around is a completely different heroine than in the previous films and it should be stated, the film suffers when Weaver is not on screen. The film delivers the gory goods but at times, the film is too gruesome. Unlike the first and second installments, which features one or two truly grisly scenes and chooses to give us heart-pounding action in place of the gore, this one has one too many gory deaths on display. It is overdone to an extent that it begins to resemble an alien slasher film and nothing more. This is a shame because there is far more depth to Scott's ""Alien"" and  Cameron's ""Aliens""; it was not just about the carnage. The special effects are state-of-the-art and the aliens themselves are impressive, especially the ""Queen"" but it becomes clear that at this point the series has run out of good ideas. There are also too many head scratching scenes that look haphazardly edited and somewhat out of place and the forced humor becomes distracting.

""Alien - Resurrection"" is slick but it remains greatly inferior to the first 2 films. The debate can continue which is better, ""Alien 3"" or ""Resurrection"" (my pick is ""Alien 3"" - Expanded Cut but only by a hair)  however ""Resurrection"" moves at a much faster pace but despite a high body count and numerous slimy beasts parading before our eyes, nothing can mask the films flaws. Overall, it is a silly movie. For Sci-Fi fans, I recommend getting the Alien box sets -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Anthology/dp/B001AQO3QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Anthology</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Quadrilogy/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Quadrilogy</a>. I have the ""Quadrilogy"" set and all films (including ""Resurrection"") are given impeccable treatment in picture and sound. You also get the Theatrical cut along with the Directors cut and a whole assortment of extras.

934900,4,6304844948,"Nothing very special about this compared to the average decent sci-fi film save that, once more, we get a chance to spend time with Sigourney Weaver. The cast includes the stereotypical bunch of bad guys, who are semi-good guys here because they are opposed to the
stereotypical Mad Scientists working for the Government.. These Mad Scientists, of course, are fanatically devoted to anything that will harm Humanity and put the Government in a  position to beat up on the rest of the Universe. The actors here do throw themselves into doing what the stereotypes demand they do...the result being unoriginal  but almost non-stop action. There is a new look on at least one of the monsters but that is about all the change in them  from the way they  appeared in the three earlier pictures.
On the other hand, if the other three films in the series have not been seen in a sufficiently long time period, there is  plenty of action to keep  you watching, as well as changes in Weaver's role which you will find interesting. All in all, a watchable film with no message but one that will probably fulfill the need for a couple of hours of no-think, knockabout, action and another look at Sigourney Weaver winding up her run as SuperWoman.",1410307200,,1234,4.689814814814815

The characters were stock. The character of Ripley acted as if she were channelling a homicidal verison of Capt. Jack Sparrow!  My group in college named the Ripley character from the Aliens movie Rambolina and we watched it probably every weekend for a whole semester and that was the VHS verison; yes, I'm that old.  I like Ron Perlman but couldn't care that much about his character; seen that same character in a dozen movies.  Basically the director, producer, actors, and special effects crew phoned this verison of the movie in.  Forgive me but if they did not stop with this movie, they should have.  If they did, good!

935098,3,6304844948,"Alien: Resurrection (1997). 20th Century Fox. Rated ""R"". Running Time: One Hour, 48 mins.
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Written by Joss Whedon, based upon the characters by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett.
This is the fourth movie of the series.

Sigourney Weaver returns as ""Ripley"". She also served as co-producer. Tom Woodruff Jr. returns as the lead alien.

On the medical research vessel, USM Auriga, are 42 enlisted crew members with 7 science officers. Beyond the doors with security guards is someone in an upright tube. It is a naked woman. It is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Dr. Gediman (Brad Dourif) says she is perfect. On the operating table, they make an incision to remove the small Alien out of her. The Alien is still, but able to move its mouth. The Alien is extracted. They call the Alien their ""host"". When Dr. Gediman asks ""What about her. Can we keep her alive""?, Dr. Wren (J.E. Freeman) says to sew her up.  It seems they care more about the Alien than they do Ripley.
  They put Ripley in a deep chamber to sleep and she is in a silk cocoon. When she awakes, she easily breaks the cocoon and notices a number 8 on her arm.  The doctor examines her and Ripley finds him repulsive. She attempts to fight back. They shock her with a prod and hand-cuff her. She is put through psychological tests. She has the memories of Ripley. This Ripley was made from blood samples found at the Fiorina. They cloned her. Ripley has extra-strength and is good with a basketball.  The Alien has survived and has grown quickly. It is a bigger genetic crossing. It is the Queen. It won't stay in that tank for too much longer.

Also in the cast: Gary Dourdan, Michael Wincott, Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, Winona Ryder, Raymond Cruz.

Language in English. Subtitles in English and Spanish.

935102,4,6304844948,"I really love this movie even with its flaws. That doesn't mean it deserves 5 stars. Honestly I love anything with Sigourney weaver in it she just brings ridiculous amounts of magic to any movie. if she was not in this movie I prob wouldn't bother watching it. She is the main character tho so its hard not to have her in it. This is favouritism I know but its how I am. This movie is very colourful, packed full of action and has some really brilliant ideas.

I was fine with this until I heard the aliens ""Growling"", what? who the hell's idea was that? they sounded like a bunch of lions, I just cant deal with that. But there are new insights to their characters. I read the book before I saw the movie and it was really cool to have an idea of what was going on between those three aliens before they escaped and started the chaos that follows. but they growled..sigh just no that's not cool at all I think it took the ""scary"" part of them.

the cast is fairly good I enjoyed watching them die but was a bit disappointed when one was killed off really early. Some death scenes are really good I have to say its very entertaining.

This is a very good movie with some very good ideas, some bad ones but mostly very good. I won't spoil the ending its quite freaky and gross. This blu ray movie is worth having in anyone's dvd collection. I would recommend buying the box set though.",1398297600,,1384,4.234848484848484

935153,4,6304844948,"Ok, so the Alien series is awesome. Fantastic scary creature created by a gifted artist that lurks in the shadow before pummeling a bit of your face off with a second mouth- what a great idea. The art, the haunting atmosphere, the daunting music, and a female lead that is tough and only gets tougher.
So here's the fourth and final movie of the Alien franchise- and yes, there is a reason I do not acknowledge the AVP series. If you think that is an acceptable Alien movie, stop reading. We're not really ever going to get along. Anyway, Resurrection is near and dear to my heart for one purpose- I couldn't get over it when it was released. Weaver is much older but still playing this character that has been a part of her psyche for 19 years, and I respect that. Especially when she's bringing a different viewpoint this time. And watching her punk out now Hellboy and SOA hall of famer Ron Perlman is just good stuff.
Let's be serious- this is out there. There are a multitude of ""uhhh, why?"" moments and things that are not necessary and overly cheesy. You can tell immediately that this is a 90's film- the finesse of the original film isn't here. But I can't let this go, especially with such a pretty, glossy alien to look at.",1392681600,,1234,4.416666666666667

935155,5,6304844948,"Unconventional in relationship to what had gone before it that is; not in terms of the overall structure of the plot, which is, as many people have noted, very much conventional.
The problem people have with this movie is that it is radically different from Alien and Aliens, the two films before that were of excellent quality. Alien 3 was botched, though that wasn't so much the director's fault as the absurd circumstances he had to work under.
Realistically, if you follow the plot arch from Alien to Aliens to Alien 3, how could this film have had a significantly different plot structure and still contained the Ripley character? The director did what he could with the film, given the constraints with which he had to work. This film could have been improved somewhat, but not without setting itself up for a sequel, which, as we see, never materialized.
When I first watched this film in 1997, I was somewhat disappointed by it. Returning to it now in 2014, I appreciate it much more. When we see the utter monstrosities that have been foisted on other 'sequels' from film franchises from the 80s-Star Wars and Indiana Jones come to mind-this film sparkles by comparison.",1391558400,2,1179,4.784313725490196

935245,5,6304844948,"I don't own this DVD but I have seen this movie on cable a few times, most recently on ShowTime or the IFC channel.

I liked it although I'm not sure I totally understood everything. I would probably have to watch it a few more times to completely understand all the subtle details.

The movie has a sort of semi realistic feeling, perhaps because the director is French. The French have a way of making strange subjects seem somewhat believable.

To me the movie is worth watching just for the scene in the laboratory where they show the results of genetic experimentation run amok.

Genetic engineering seems to be the underlying theme in the movie but as I said some of that escaped my understanding.

There's some other good parts like an underwater battle with the aliens. The creatures can swim which I didn't realize.

Sigourney Weaver still looks good.

I like Ron Perlman also. He appears in an episode of a TV show called Masters Of Horror where his daughter goes into some sort of fertility clinic. That TV show was directed by John Carpenter.

935338,1,6304844948,"Wow. This was, in some ways, even worse than Alien 3 and that's almost an achievement in itself. I don't want to spoil anything, but if the government of Earth is as dumb as it was in the movie then the alien deserves to eat us all. Also, the characters were a mishmosh of all the worst of Joss Whedon's usual gimmicks, creating quirkly, but completely unsympathetic characters. It was actually a relief when they shuffled off the screen just because it was one less annoying cliche to grate on one's nerves. Even Ripley herself went from being an interesting and complex (for horror movies anyway) character to a two dimensional special effect.  I think it would have been better if they had let the Alien series die with some dignity instead of making Alien 3 and this horrible film, but I guess they were chasing the almighty dollar. There have been 6 movies in the series but so far the only good ones are Alien, Aliens, and AvP (which was more good-ish).",1382140800,5,959,4.543352601156069

935340,4,6304844948,"Alien Resurrection is one of my two favorites out of the Alien series. I really like human-alien hybrid that Sigourney Weaver plays in this movie. It's Ripley with a twist. Winona Rider does a good job in a supporting role in this film.
The corporation is up to it's old tricks in this movie. The potential for profit overrides the fact that they are dealing with an alien species that has a predatory nature and needs humans as host for their embryos. This is a recipe for disaster and eventually the aliens get loose and gain control of the ship which is headed back for earth. The humans have to make a last stand to keep this species from reaching planet earth and causing devastation.
I can't quite give Alien Resurrection a 5 star rating because of the cartoon-like quality of filming the alien species swimming in water in pursuit of the humans combatting them. That shot comes off as cheap and should have been handled much better.
Sigourney Weaver as the human-alien hybrid carries this film well. One of the most compelling scenes of the film is all of the previous hybrid versions the corporation scientists collected and housed. One of the hybrids that resembled the human Ripley more so obviously suffered but was kept alive. Overall Alien Resurrection was a pretty good film.",1376438400,,1289,4.733333333333333

935342,5,6304844948,"I've read in other places that this movie is a send-up of the previous Alien films.
We've got the very dim, faithless view of humanity. There are caricatures of the scruffy badasses we've seen before (their swearing and the amount of it sounds unnatural and ridiculous). The medical / science team is a caricature of what's come before.
The humor is like what you'd find in Tales From The Crypt. Regular people may not have known that this movie is meant to be funny. And it is darkly funny - parts of it make me laugh out loud.
Audiences may not have known what to make of this movie, may not have understood where it was coming from. There may have been no explanation beforehand.
Perhaps many viewers could not relate to Sigourney Weaver's character as a monster. But I enjoy this new Ripley. I can relate to her well.
In the end, it's almost as if the movie's producers wished to ruin this series.
Alien Resurrection is a curious film that can be hard to like, but I find plenty in it to enjoy. There are scenes I can watch again and again.",1373587200,,1044,4.38659793814433

935344,2,6304844948,"Alien Resurrection, this movie is not the best film in comparison to its predecessors, but I will give it credit for trying to breathe life back into the ALIEN franchise since the underrated release of ALIEN 3 in 1992. I saw this movie in theatres in 1997 and was impressed by the special effects and the revival of the alien creature using CGI, but that is where my awe ended. The writer of the script Joss Whedon, was extremely unhappy with the final film, also producers David Giler and Walter Hill objected to this film even being made, believing that it would ruin the franchise. Also, the director chose a ""dark comedy"" theme for the film which gives it a bizarre feel. In general, the story is very thin and the characters are very comic book-like. ALIEN 3 wrapped up the series to where this film had to find ways to cheat. The ""B"" team cast was not as  good the first 3 films were. Essentially in story, you have the Poseidon Adventure in outer space with aliens, with the ""disabled"" ship and underwater sequences. In hindsight after seeing the array of AVP sequels that followed, Alien Resurrection marked the final ""honest"" attempt to continue the franchise of films, though the year 1997 certainly marked the beginning of the end for the series as a whole. It is a dark movie with a bizarre out-of-place feel and it is sometimes overly gross and gory. The film is a constant parody of itself and the franchise and is riddled with poorly placed dark humor and one liners.

Though I give it a strong criticism, the movie is watchable and many people actually do like the film (I would not say this film is a step up from ALIEN 3 at all). It is often attached to ALIEN Blu-ray and DVD compilations that include the first 3 films. Watch the film for the sake of watching it. It isn't a masterpiece, but it also isn't unwatchable like the films that follow it. You'll either love it or hate it.",1372636800,,1901,4.475504322766571

Ripley is cloned. This clone has inherited some of the Alien's DNA. The result is a Super Human Ripley - Ripley 2.0 This one has super strength, enhanced senses, rapid healing, acid blood, and telepathy.

Like the other Alien chapters this has humans obsessed with capturing and controlling the aliens. A military. who's training doesn't even remotely prepare them to combat the Aliens. Civilian characters, who's bad-ass attitudes and survival instincts allow a few to survive.

The cloned Aliens also result in a new breed of Alien. All things considered. This is a strong addition to the Alien series",1368576000,,653,5.1415094339622645
935412,4,6304844948,This collector's edition actually had changes to the storyline and special FX that I won't go into because it was such a surprise to see.  This longer version had a lot more detail that made the story more enjoyable than the theatrical release.  I enjoyed the behind the scenes disc as well.

935413,4,6304844948,"This is the Alien movie where they try to have it both ways.  The Aliens are supposedly gone or hiding on a planet no one knows about, so some military scientists just happen to get a hold of some of Ripley's blood to clone her and a queen.  When and where did they get her 200-year-old blood?  AND!  The queen they get has no ability to lay eggs, now that she has a womb.  So where did the eggs come from that they use on the kidnapped humans in stasis?  Leftover from Easter?

This bizarre movie starts with a visual bug joke then rapidly alternates between horror and humor (plus a grotesque kissing scene behind glass that defies classification).  Some of the actors were more of a hindrance than a help (notably Dan Hedaya and J.E. Freeman).  Brad Dourif was a bad joke.  Winona Ryder was awkward.  Ron Perlman was Ron Perlman: loud and gruff.  Some of the dialog didn't make sense (particularly the reference to a toaster oven).  But at least they have the new and improved Ripley #8 to add a jolt to the humdrum photocopy feel of the plot.

I like this movie because it's still about the Aliens and after all, that's all it was ever about: Ripley and the Aliens.  (They can use that title for another sequel as far as I'm concerned.)",1367539200,,1240,4.37719298245614

935415,1,6304844948,"This Sci-Fi video was one of the worst I have even seen. The story, the actors, the robots as well as the heroes/ heroines and villains looked like a BAD Sophomoric High School play.  I am not normally a Sci-Fi fan, but the cover artwork looked interesting so I rented this video as a fluke. Here is a small list of the very noticeable flaws.
1)The ratings are almost equal in each of the 1 to 5 ratings. This tell you geeks, freaks and nerds were undecided.
2)In 2532 it seemed strange to see normal cars parked on the road..in a fog?
3)As with all scenes the images are smeared and shown in a fog
4)A very old, used  LP powered fork lift in 2532?
5)The two 1970-80 Datsun or Isuzu pickup trucks in the store room. I guess its true Japanese cars last a long time!
6)The padded folding room dividers served as walls, entry ways and even as elevators.
7) The Robots could not used any ""explosive device or weapon to even hurt people"" but could use a Star Wars"" sword?
8)For some reason whenever the guns fired the sound level drops at least 30db so it could just barely be heard
9)Having ordinary garage doors (to the outside?) 83 floor below ground
10)When ever anyone shots at any of the ""monsters"" (who all look alike regardless of size, they have to be seen in a fog and when fired on or ""stabbed"" you can never see the impact or the shooter in the same shot. There for they were likely modified cheap Mattel toys.
11)I also like the ""advance Robot factory"" made up of junk from a 50's machine shop.
12)The 83 story decent took a simulated 2 minutes to get to the bottom but at the end of the movie when only 19seconds remained till the nuclear bomb went off, it only took 2 or 3 seconds to reach the top and enter the `Trash can spaceship helicopter"" both of these time warps designed to save film
13)I really like the ending which showed our heroine protecting herself from 2532 air pollution by wearing only a pair of small Speedo swim goggles.
14)The one saving grace, and high point of this super low budget, made directly for video release, was the ""Pandora Machine"" production logo, which was a topless Oriental woman, also in a of fog.
This is a great movie to rent for a sleepless night. The sound automatically turns all but off during shooting and jet take off times and is so boring you might only stay awake to see if the play the Pandora logo again slowly at the end. LOL",1367366400,,2388,4.328125

935472,3,6304844948,"...I had to get this one to add to the ""Alien"" collection. However, I would not have bought it if I did not have the others. ""Alien Resurrection"" is a pretty average movie that relies more on grotesque imagery rather than on its slightly above average story. Essentially, it is the same story as ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien,"" but with a few different characters and ending.
Weaver, as always in her roles, does an amazing job with her character. However, I think the finished product as a whole is below her ability. I'm sure, on paper, this movie looked a lot better and would like to think that was what led to Weaver's decision to participate in the movie. Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast (save Ryder) does a great job with their characters and are enjoyable to watch, but, in my opinion, there seems to be some biological inconsistencies in the story even with the suspension of disbelief that left me feeling that this movie was simply an okay addition to the collection.",1360713600,2,977,4.588571428571429
935473,3,6304844948,"What do you do when your main character is dead and you are out of originality? Start cloning, of course! ALIEN RESURRECTION marks the unfortunate return of Lieutenant Ellen Ripley; Unfortunate, in this case, because of the ridiculous direction in which the filmmakers have taken the character, and the poor scripting that makes her a shell of her former self. 200 years after sacrificing herself to protect the human race from utter annihilation, Ripley has been cloned with unexpected results: The DNA of the Queen Alien that she is harboring within her has fused with her own. Military scientists have successfully managed to remove the Queen while keeping both alive, but it isn't long before a new breed of aliens are unleashed upon the vessel. Like AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS and DEEP BLUE SEA, ALIEN RESURRECTION was tailored specifically for the MTV Generation. Acclaimed director Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives us a flashy, gore-filled spectacle, but one that is agonizingly boring and entirely without substance. RESURRECTION pastes together bits and pieces from the previous films without achieving a single success of its own. It just goes to show that the series should have died with Ripley at the end of the third film.

Just one of many complaints, but why did he need to do that again?  Seems like he could have just unbuckled himself and grabbed the ladder.

935602,4,6304844948,"Being a huge Whedonite, I find it almost tratorious to have a lot of unabashed like for ALIEN RESURRECTION. The lone script credit on this film is still given to Whedon, and on the special edition of this film, you get to read the entire film script as written by Whedon, and you see how different it was. Some of his ideas were used, and many weren't. Many bits of trivia about the film float around on the internet and largely, they focus on what the film could have been. Chow Yun-Fat as Christie? How AWESOME would that have been? I like Gary Dourdan and all, but it's Chow Yun-Fat, man! And yes, the whole idea of the hybrid that was put forth in this film is nothing like what Whedon had written.

All these things that, if a studio like Fox could allow themselves to put more faith in a genius like Joss Whedon, we might have seen (and had this film been made post-AVENGERS, we'd definitely see it) but I still can't get myself to the point where I don't like this film. It's a hell of a ride, and has some incredibly strong momentum with a whole new and fresh take on the character of Ellen Ripley. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a very good job of creating a vision unlike any of the other three ALIEN films (which is something that seems to be very unique about the ALIEN quadrilogy; every director from Ridley Scott to James Cameron to David Fincher to Jeunet all made their own film with their own style), and the actors from Weaver to Ryder (in possibly her last good role prior to her bit parts in STAR TREK and BLACK SWAN) to Ron Perlman to great character actors like Michael Wincott to Dan Hedaya to Brad Dourif to J.E. Freeman to Leland Orser to Raymond Cruz... everything works and it works well.

Like Jeunet's sensibilities, and even like Whedon's, everything's a little off-center. The scenes of action and suspense in this film are there (particularly in the film's centerpiece of the underwater cafeteria they need to swim through), but they're almost secondary to the film's ideas and its characters, and that's where the film shines brightest. And the actual concept and look of the xenomorph/human hybrid is very compelling and I thought worked very well.

ALIENS, to me, was the peak of this quadrilogy, and no, it doesn't get any better, but after the messianic misfire of ALIEN 3, ALIEN RESURRECTION is pretty darn awesome, even if it doesn't have Chow Yun-Fat.",1341878400,,2383,4.55011655011655

Apone (with a beautiful grin, and cigar in his fingers), ""Bay 12, please.""  Alien 3 may have lacked the overall power of the first two, but there we see a truly grief-stricken Ripley, one ready at last to give her own life.

What makes Resurrection pay off for me is Sigourney Weaver's acting.  This Ripley is a trip!  She speaks in a sly, wink-wink manner, but can as easily rip your head off.  Her senses are heightened, and she tears it up on the court.  This hybrid Ripley, part-human/part-alien, has red acid for blood, already sees the impending doom, and seems rather amused by it all.

935658,4,6304844948,"J.R., and G.H.--what you both are forgetting is that A: the Alien Queen laid an egg aboard The Sulaco's Escape Ship at the end of 'ALIENS' (where she stowed away), and Ripley was impregnated during hyper-sleep after blowing the Queen out of the airlock (didn't you pay attention to the intro of 'Alien 3'?). The Alien Queens most important instinct is the continuation of it's species. Ripley's blood samples were then taken from Fiorina 151 ('The Prison Planet') at the END of Alien 3 for use by Weyland Yutani-the mega-corporation that eventually corners the market of just about everything on earth-including (of course) bio-weapons research. Since the 'Derelict Ship' and 'Hadley's Hope' on LV-426 were both destroyed by the fusion reactor 's HUGE nuclear explosion, the only way WY could pursue this species was THROUGH the cloning process which had been almost perfected. REMEMBER--Weyland Yutani has been pursuing this alien organism since Ridley Scott's first (and BEST) film in the series, disregarding any and all human life to get it. It means Trillions of dollars to them. 'Alien Resurrection' is NOT a bad movie--matter of fact, it holds it's own as a 4th installment. Not only that, but it is VERY relevant in today's society...we are currently using hormones to make bigger, fatter, cows for both milk production, and of course-fatter juicier steaks, also to grow chickens faster and 'plumper' and to make them lay eggs faster (a popular urban myth about Kentucky Fried Chicken comes to mind-that their chickens are actually genetically GROWN rather than hatched from eggs for FASTER reproduction and larger plumper chickens--thus the company was forced to call itself 'KFC' since it was not using 'real' natural chickens. The company was not allowed to use the word 'Chicken' anymore in it's ad campaign's-lol!), and of course our recent success at cloning sheep (and who KNOWS what else goes on behind Government lab doors). Thus cloning the impregnated Ripley (with a QUEEN alien) was THE only way for WY to FINALLY get it's hands on the alien organism-with a Queen, they could then get all the eggs they could want. Plus this was a great way to FINALLY bring the species to earth (in a much more believable scenario than AVP:Requiem (Read: AVP: 90210). So that's that guys. An IMPREGNATED Ripley's blood WOULD reproduce Ripley WITH embryo intact. When a woman is pregnant the embryo is VERY MUCH a part of her. And we are talking WAAAAAYYY in the future here gentlemen--who's to say how advanced the genetic reproduction process has become? As for Sigourney Weaver's accepting a 'huge paycheck' for reprising Ellen Ripley--let's see you guys turn down a multi-million dollar check to play a role in a film!!! I highly DOUBT you would. Does that make Ms. Weaver a bad person? NOT. And Weaver is NOT reprising her 'Ellen Ripley' role anyway! She is playing a HYBRID CLONE who was intended to be destroyed by the Med Chief--but was spared due to her progress and interesting DNA (as I said earlier-the process was NEARLY perfected-see the first 7 attempts at Ripley's clone for proof of this). Weaver's performance is FABULOUS (as usual) in her strange and subtle looks and gestures-as well as her new found empathy for this creature who she now shares genes with. As far as the rest of the film goes, it is imaginative, well acted, pretty large in scope, and the FX are top notch. And the 'Aliens' themselves are the closest in looks to Giger's original Alien (which was built to the most realistic and accurate specs out of ALL the films in this series--full body suit sculpted by creator H.R. Giger himself, and mechanical nightmarish head by Carlo Rambaldi). Kudos once again to Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis for their work in 'Alien: Resurrection')! Thank goodness for them keeping the translucent domes again! Fincher knew that really works much better than an Alien without the dome (as in Cameron's Epic sequel and in AVP:Requiem--the Alien without it's dome is BLASPHEMY in any Giger fans opinion)! So there you have it. I really hate when some folks refuse to suspend their disbelief a bit when it comes to celluloid-especially Sci-Fi and Horror. Films are made for our ENJOYMENT and films like THIS are made for the rush of adrenaline we feel when shocked or scared. To 'nitpick' a film like this is downright silly in the first place...and to create things that are obvious baloney just to 'hate on it' because you didn't like it is pointless.

This movie was just horrible. SO bad. I could go on at length about the problems with it, but one of my biggest ones was the DE-volution of the alien. Spoiler below:

That's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking. Because everything they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from it. And people assume that if I hated it then they'd changed the script...but it wasn't so much they changed it, they executed it in such a ghastly fashion they rendered it unwatchable."" - Joss Whedon on Alien: Resurrection

This was Whedon's response to accusations that Jean Pierre-Jeunet deviated from the screenplay he had written. These accusations were brought forth by the fact that Whedon expressed his displeasure in the film. In reality he was upset with the fact that he had written the screenplay with a tongue in cheek tone, but in the end the director opted to play the film straight. The result became part of the inspiration for my favorite show from Whedon: Firefly. Needless to say that has gained more acclaim and a greater fan following than Alien: Resurrection.

Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), having died at the end of Alien3, has been cloned by the corporation 200 years after her death. She's become a blend of alien and human, the soldier that they have been looking for. In turn they have also created new aliens, but when they escape from their holding pin it is up to the alien hybrid Ripley to help a mercenary crew escape from the Auriga ship they are being held captive on.

Honestly, I don't get all the hate for Alien: Resurrection. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a great movie but I did enjoy it more than Alien3 and people seem to enjoy that movie much more than this. That's something I've never been quite able to grasp. For me, anytime Ron Perlman is involved in a flick I stand up and take notice, and he does a great job at adding levity to the proceedings here. Sigourney Weaver also seems to be having more fun than she has the entire series as well. She's able to play around with the character she created in the first Alien and evolve, since she's a hybrid, into a somewhat ambiguous character.

While Jean Pierre-Jeunet did not completely keep to Whedon's script he still seems to be having fun with the movie. For a guy who codirected flicks like Amelie and Delicatessen, he keeps something of that French tongue in cheek spirit. I think that we as Americans sometimes can't exactly see that for what it is. At the same time though, do we really want that from our Alien movies? Alien and Aliens were brilliant pieces of work that didn't rely on levity in their proceedings, but Alien3 was so dark that it might have required such levity. Either way I think this is still the last decent flick in the series.

Looking back on the series I think Alien3 is the weakest link, unfortunately I seem to be in the minority. Alien3 had the benefit of being directed largely by future Oscar nominee David Fincher; whereas Alien: Resurrection was directed by Jean Pierre-Jeunet, who had not directed a flick alone or in English prior to this film (he required a translator on site in order to communicate with the cast). Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon, Perlman, Weaver, and Alien newbie Winona Ryder among a largely entertaining cast help make this film a lot more fun than people like to admit. I recommend this over Alien3, but then again I would recommend all of the Alien flicks to first time watchers. Even at its worst, it's better than most Science Fiction series.

But it is a whole lot better than either of the Alien v Predator movies, both of which were truly atrocious. I know, I feel like I'm saying Star Wars Episode I is better than the 2008 Clone Wars movie, but I digress...

Alien: Resurrection is either worth a rental or just worth putting up with in your Alien Anthology set -- watch it once, shrug it off, move on, but do watch it. It's flawed, to be sure, but it's not That Bad. If nothing else, watch it as a double feature with one of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's earlier films (especially City of Lost Children or Delicatessen) to compare a pure Jeunet film with one made in Hollywood conditions.

A4 has a fairly unique (for the film series) visual style, with washed out and harsh greens, browns, golds.
""Firefly"" fans and Whedonistas will probably see in the held back and not-very-inspiring crew of the Betty a prototype for the ""Firefly"" crew.
The tone is confused, wavering between grotesque surrealism, violent horror, overzealous/awkwardly hyper action movie and comic book caper, and flat-falling attempts at dark humor. Oh, well.

The film-makers decided for some reason that quadrupling the amount of slime and KY jelly covering the Aliens, and showing more acid and guts and gore of all kinds was the way to go. In their obsession with cheap horror movie tricks and cliches, they lost sight of character, even in the creatures. The Queen is back, only to look ridiculous in mammalian pregnancy, and the Newborn (the Jar Jar of the Alien series?) had potential, but mostly doesn't work, ultimately and ignominiously getting sucked out of the airlock as if the film-makers just gave up on him when they excised writer Joss Whedon's earlier ending.

Winona Ryder makes a valiant -but losing- struggle of giving Call character. She does have moments, but not many. The new Ripley -- now a part-Alien hybrid-- is a very fascinating character that is ultimately under-explored here. The rest of the human characters are just very broad stereotypes that no amount of stunt-casting can save. And the language....sometimes I don't mind cursing, which can have a dramatic function, but here it's over-the-top, clumsy, and immature.

The action varies wildly from some okay setpieces to some ridiculously unbelievable sequences. The practical creature effects are okay, but the CGI versions of the Aliens --beautiful as they look-- are painfully obvious to today's eyes. John Frizzell's (yeah, I know, Who?!!!) score is just lazy and uninspired horror-action music. (Even so, his idiot underwater suspense cue got used in two or three dozen trailers of the 1998-2004 period, for typically unfathomable Hollywood reasons.)

Also comes with intriguing open ending that could have led to a better second half to this story, exploring Ripley 8 and Call and Earth a bit more.
OK, it's not great, but if you haven't seen it yet (esp. if you've suffered either or both [!] AvP movies), give this one a viewing, imagine how cool it could have been had they tried harder, then move on.",1319414400,,3170,4.904850746268656
935686,2,6304844948,"With the self-sacrifice of Ripley in Alien 3, the Alien series could have just ended right there with two classic films and a good but troubled third installment. But what do you know? It seems that 200 years after the events of the previous film, they managed to make a clone of Ripley from blood samples that were taken before she died. But why bother with the cloning process when there is barely anything worthwhile in this film?

First off, did I already mention that Ripley is not in this film? Yes, Sigourney Weaver is part of the cast, but now her character has alien DNA that gives her certain traits shared by the aliens that her previous incarnation has been fighting off. Then we have a crew of scientists and other ship members that are poorly developed, most notably being the miscast Winona Ryder. Even the all bald males on the prison planet in Alien 3 had more depth to their characters! These are nothing more than your typical cardboard cutouts given their stereotypical role.

The script is rather cliche and tired if anything. Joss Whedon takes the screenwriting responsibilities rather than director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is well known for screenwriting the rest of his works. We could tell what was going to happen from a mile away, further eliminating any aspect of suspense. It comes to the point that we don't care that the characters are getting killed. It just comes to show that paper thin personalities blend well with predictable deaths.

Alien 3 really depressed me;
Almost every character that fought to survive in the second movie die

brainless, foul-mouthed prisoners that I personally didn't care for, the F-
word is practically butchered, and I personally wanted to see them
develop on Ripley and the queen more...
I actually enjoyed this movie.
1. There was a lot of action (mainly gun fights with the alien creatures)!
2. Most of the actors were great with their characters. Most of them...
3. I personally liked that they added Winona Ryder, Micheal Wincott,
Ron Perlman, and other great actors into the ALIEN universe.
4. The scene when Ripley was looking at her early clones in the tubes
was a very powerful and emotional part of the movie!
5. Ripley may not have had all her memories intact, but she still proved
to be a strong individual!
6. It was cool how she had also had the strength, agility, and speed of an
alien! As well as the acid blood of one...
7. Joss Whedon did a great job with restoring the ALIEN universe to it's true
roots with his script!

What I didn't like was:
1. Most of the restored footage in the special edition made the movie weird.
2. I didn't understand most of what the newborn alien was about...
3. Ron Perlman was a great edition to the cast, but his character was a little
weird!
4. Micheal Wincott's character: Elgyn was killed off too soon!

Giving her fast healing capabilities and super-human strength the Ripley of before is now supercharged and a formidable adversary to any alien she may encounter.

`Alien Resurrection' is set 200 years after `Alien 3', but not much has changed. The company (in a new guise) wants the alien for military purposes and Ripley wants to stop that from happening, only this time she as split loyalties dues to her genetic mutation. Winona Rider is a member of a smuggling crew caught up in the melee and whilst she is ok in this film, her elfin image doesn't really sit with a hardened sci-fi action film.

The direction is pretty good and Weaver is as good as she has ever been. She has a darker streak in this film and it suits her. The alien effects are also still good and in this film we see the aliens swim, as well as meeting a new incarnation that I won't say more about here to maintain the surprise.

All in all this is a decent sequel in the series and I enjoy it at least as much as `Alien 3' but, like that film, it never matches the creepiness of `Alien' or the action of `Aliens'. Still, this is well worth watching if you have seen the rest and makes for a fairly decent sci-fi film.

935690,5,6304844948,"The reviewers are pretty hard on this one.  I think it offers the series new life, with a fertile battery of new ideas and possibilities of plot development, with new characters and an implied political configuration.  Plus, the story works extremely well and the gore is kept to a minimum though enough new meat is dished up to satisfy those who hunger for imagined violence.

200 years after the demise of Ripley, she is cloned from the blood sample that was obtained when the addict doctor discovered she was ""infected"" in the third film.  However, it is Ripley with a difference:  her dna has been mixed with that of the alien queen, producing a mysterious hybrid of super strength whose own blood is acid but whose mind is largely human.  She wakes on board a military research ship, administered by a group of sociopaths and secret from whatever political authorities there are on Earth.  The arrival of the Betty, a mercenary ship bearing the research meat, brings a mix of criminals and an idealist who is thinking of the good of mankind, or so we would think.  Of course, the alien life bursts out of its constraints and wreaks havoc, made infinitely worse by the human evil on board the ship.

I enjoyed the theme of the film:  evolution, with the creation of an array of hybrids between alien and human.  Their variations represent potential evolutionary futures.  After all, the key is survival.  Another theme is the balance between loyalty and ideals.  Will the humans stick together and survive?  Will the new Ripley chose aliens over humans?  What will the robot operatives - another evolutionary line possibility - add to the mix?  Does the future belong to the mercenaries?  To the political order on Earth?  To the corporations?

REcommended as one of the best of the series.  It is by far the richest in terms of concept, very fun food for the imagination, which is one of the strongest arguments in favor of hard scifi.  There are many wonderful details, such as the Ripley clone discovery of a robot: she is unsurprised, stating that only a robot could be so humane and ethical.

Aliens are being implanted in hosts with the hope of keeping the young aliens alive and bringing them to their full nastiness. There is a reverence in the air as they go about their business; do they fully understand what they are dealing with? Perhaps. Big science has come a long way in a few hundred years. The arrogance you see now? Nothing compared to what's coming.

Apparently not, because they've had the rather dubious idea of splicing the genes of now-dead Ellen Ripley with alien DNA. A tough woman and a tough monster; a very nasty surprise awaits them. And then there's the fully grown alien in the cargo hold of the freighter that is transporting them. ""She'll breed, you'll die."" That's all Ripley knows for certain.

Because Ripley doesn't fully understand what she is. Born only days ago, she only knows a desire to kill. She has some of Ripley's memories, but there are gaps. As those gaps fill, there's bound to be repercussions, if Ripley takes up her old mission of exterminating what she now is.

Alien Resurrection is much more of a commentary on a not-so-distant future than the previous movies. That might make it a bit of a disappointment, though there's still plenty of action.

lesberotic - definitely a winner - go to imdb and check out the images of sigourney weaver leaning over winona ryder and holding her by the jaw...nice bit of tension here.

that alone would make the 5 stars for me.  but beyond this...

philosophical - once again ripley is back and sufficiently bad-ass.  this continues the theme in the series of perceptions of good and evil and also deepens the well of character development of ripley and her relationships.  while the movies started out much more subtly, this one leads you to much more direct and obvious questions regarding which ""aliens"" are good and which are bad (aliens vs. humans) by presenting ripley as a a genetic half alien half human and by presenting call as synthetic - both of whom demonstrate more feeling, deeper connections, and moral conflict than any of the pure human or alien characters.  it calls into question the motivation and feeling of ripley as a mother to her alien offspring...  this brings obvious philosophical fodder about the impact of identity and feelings of duty or purpose and how these things play into choices and interactions, human nature, good vs. evil, etc.

935759,2,6304844948,"Greed.  'Twas the only reason to make this mockery of the storied Alien franchise.  ""Let's throw something together and link it to 'Alien',"" studio executives must have been saying, ""and soak up as much doe as we can until word-of-mouth kills it.""  And therefore ALIEN: RESURRECTION was made, with a disinterested Sigourney Weaver and enough nonsense to overrun a lunatic asylum--and a howler for an ending only too appropriate (the monster gets flushed away).

Following the last noble installment, it is now, like, 100, or 200, or something-hundred, years later; there is no Ripley--but there is a clone of her, merged with some DNA from the queen alien herself.  So now Ripley is this ticked off superhuman with a perpetual smirk suggesting Weaver was under the impression ALIEN: RESURRECTION wasn't a serious offering, but satire.  If only it had been.  Of course, the alien itself has been cloned, and scientists are now breeding it as the ultimate military weapon--all under the foolish notion they can ""control"" this pesky acid-bleeder.  A band of (yawn) smugglers comes aboard, the alien runs amuck, most of the snide military folks get their comeuppance, Weaver looks bored, then the nonsense ending.  There.  Just saved you some green.

Yes, there is a supporting cast; it looks just as ambivalent as this film's star.  Winona Ryder wanders about with an irritatingly confused expression; she only changes it when she encounters Ripley, changing to an expression of wanton desire (if she and Weaver had liplocked maybe they could have salvaged some of this turkey).  Brad Dourif is his usual creepy self, name me a movie Dan Hedaya has not been in, and Ron Perlman looks like the poster boy for halitosis.  ALIEN: RESURRECTION is just awful, and in no way should be associated with the other three remarkable predecessors.

935760,4,6304844948,"I purchased this item (and the entire series) as a Collector's Edition because I was hesitant to buy the Quadrilogy (due to the rumored compression errors).

I'm rating this 4 out of 5 stars because of the packaging, which is a flimsy digipak.

A cardboard flap on the right holds the booklet inside the inner sleeve.  The discs themselves snap into plastic cases glued to the back of the cardboard sleeve, which folds up like a letter that slides into the main case.

The biggest annoyance to the packaging is that the back of each sleeve is covered in a piece of artwork printed on a flimsy sheet of paper that's glued to the back of the it and held in place by a gob of adhesive.  This actually came off when I tried to pull the DVD sleeve out.

As for playback, it wasn't flawless (to my immediate dismay).  After 53:32, disc 7 skipped while playing the Special Edition of the movie.  The DVD continued to spin in my player until I hit stop.  I then re-loaded the disc and selected the same scene (""Ripley Comes Through""), let it play up to the same point, and never encountered the problem again.  I actually played the scene three additional times without it skipping so I suspect it has something to do with how the DVD was mastered, because it seems like there's a slight jump at 53:33.

I hadn't seen this movie in a long time and it was better than I remembered, especially with the new 8 minutes of additional footage (which contains an alternate opening sequence and ending).

Disc Two seemed to play fine, as I watched about 6 of the documentaries.  My favorite was ""In The Zone:  The Basketball Scene.""

Not only did Ripley die, but the driving concerns of the series that were set up in the first film had been addressed.  So there was nowhere to go but in a radically new direction, and that's what Jean-Pierre Jeunet did.  While the first films used the aliens and the technological context in which they appeared to address the question what makes us specifically human, this new contribution to the series is more interested in the question of a possible ""post-human"" future.

In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;the enemy was not really the monster.  The monster's unique method of reproduction merely served to highlight the ""human condition"": that we are vulnerable, that our bodies are ill-equipped for survival except in the most congenial of circumstances, that they are subject to violation by organic and inorganic forces outside of us.  The idea of being ""violated"" through the mouth and ""impregnated"" by a monster is horrible, but that possibility serves to highlight our dependency upon science and technology in order to stay alive (even her on Earth), and our increasing ""alienation"" through technology from the natural world and from the evolutionary struggle for survival.  Ash (the robot scientist) and Mother (the artificially intelligent computer that kept them alive and gave instructions) and the Company (that treats human life as expendible) were the real enemies of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>.  Ripley was a hero because she didn't think scientific fact and material gain trump human empathy (her concern for a cat) and human interests.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;takes the same ideas and the same basic storyline and expands it: more military, more weapons, a girl and a sensitive soldier instead of a cat, but ends on a familiar note.  Ripley ejects the threat out of the airlock and is able to escape with her body and her principles intact.  This relatively optimistic resolution of both the first and the second film is what Fincher's third film rejected, by impregnating Ripley and killing off the girl and the boyfriend during the opening credits.  This time the issue is raised onto a theological plane and the question is whether we can find meaning in a universe where not only are there alien forces beyond our control that can destroy us but that, as a general rule even if there are exceptions, we humans either can't seem to help ourselves or don't much care as we harm others for our own gain.  Ripley seems to find meaning in her final act of destroying the alien and herself, thus saving humanity from the careless greed that would use such a monster without regard to the human consequences.  With that act, while not all questions the series raises are completely resolved, the series seems to reach a logical end, having adressed gender, reproduction, humanity, science, technology, war, all in the context of defining the human over and against those alien forces that threaten constantly to overwhelm humanity.

With Alien Resurrection, the series starts again, but in a new direction.  Sigourney Weaver is no longer playing Ripley, but an Alien/Human cloned hybrid who somehow remembers something of her former incarnation but no longer possesses the same kind of horror of the alien.  In fact what horrifies her most are images of her own creation, visions of the technological process that brought her into being.  Whereas the first three films aimed for a certain kind of realism, Alien Resurrection verges on the surrealistic nightmare landscape of Jeunet's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-City-of-Lost-Children/dp/B00000K3TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The City of Lost Children</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delicatessen/dp/B000934FC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delicatessen</a>.  What we see may seem silly or strange or skewed, but I think that is because we are intended to get a skewed, or post-human, vision of the human attempt to control the monster, that would seem strange and absurd through the eyes of the no-longer quite human Ripley and the android Call (Winona Rider).

Admittedly, this is a brief and undeveloped defense of the film - and in this brief form it is probably guilty of over-intellectualizing the films, and ""forgetting"" that the primary appeal of these films is not ""intellectual"" but visceral -- but I hope it suggests another perspective: that rather than think Alien Resurrection is a failure because it doesn't live up to the terms of the series as Ridley Scott set them up, we should consider the possibility that a ""resurrection"" of the series may require a reworking of its basic assumptions and style.  I admit to being heavily influenced in my opinions about this film by Stephen Mulhall's excellent little book On Film - while I disagree with some details of his account, I think his general approach to thinking about the Alien series as a whole is quite intelligent and compelling.)",1245801600,104,5560,5.881987577639752
935813,2,6304844948,"Resurrection? Why, what's the point?, what's the logic? what's the reason?, what's the meaning? Why?

These are questions that should have been asked before Fox greenlighted Joss Whedon's piece of work, ""Alien Resurrection"". This film is a failure on so many levels it's almost unbelievable.

After the troubled production (and obnoxious, studio-meddling) of Alien 3, you would think that someone would just have enough brains to leave it be. Just let it end on a relatively good film (who's only flaw was the studio's editing after Fincher's walkout). But no, they just couldn't leave it alone, the resurrection of this franchise has absolutely no logic behind it. How could this film possibly succeed? Someone should have said.

Let me begin my walkthrough of this horrible injustice. The beginning problem was Joss Whedon's script. Who on earth said ""Hey! let's have the buffy the vampire guy write our new Alien movie!"", And then the next big question is: Who agreed to it? The funny thing about it is that Joss has apparently escaped all retribution for this movie by stating that they filmed his perfectly good script wrong. But this argument doesn't hold up when you know the contents of the actual script, in fact, the resulting film did the original script justice (maybe even improvement).

The film starts off with no setting, and no backround. Where are we now? Why is this ship here? Who are these people? What is the universe's current conidition? Are questions that are never fully or satisfactorily answered. In fact the film is so restricted by it's limited scope that it doesn't even seem to know the answers to these questions. It just makes a large amount of excuses to get both weapons and aliens into the picture, and let me tell you their excuses involve, cloning, evil governments and pirates or ""mercenaries"" or whatever they called them (they seemed like pirates to me). Where these people came from, and why are they pirates are questions that no attempt was ever made to answer.

The biggest of the script's issues are the mind-numbingly wide plot holes that cause the entire film's premise to crumble. The excuses used to drag our battle-wearly Ripley out from the grave is so clearly ridiculous they really can't fool even the most unsrutinizing audience.

The foolishly ignorant use of science is used repeteadly throughout the film, most evident in the arrival of the ""Newborn"" (highly original name, aint it). Apparently, (SPOILERS) Since a group of scientists removed an Alien queen out of a cloned Ripley (not like that even makes sense to begin with), the queen apparently takes on human traits, such as a human reproductive system, resulting in the birth of an alien-human hybrid. The hybrid kills the queen and then identifies with Ripley as her mother (which also, doesn't make any sense). The original Whedon-design of the newborn was so ridiculous that it had to be redesigned into a better (but still awful) combination which is somewhere between the hunchback of notre-dame and casper the friendly ghost. (NOTE: All this info is thrown at you within a 4 to 5 minute period towards the end of the movie).
(SPOILERS END)

So at about this point I was asking, why? what kind of plot device is this. Randomly thrown in, it doesn't help or move the story along just simply makes it more inconceivable than it was to begin with.

So aside from Whedon's completely non-plausible script, the entire air of the story itself was a major problem. It successfully rips all terror and dark intensity from itself, only to replace it with what can best be described as swashbuckling campiness. Scenes with humorous intent were thrown here and there with no particular meaning, although the ending result was not humorous at all. There is no substance, not even one original piece worth noting, the entire film reeks of the staleness of it's own concept.

None of the acting was really worth mentioning, almost all of the performances felt weak and contrived, none of the characters had any depth or soul to them. Even Ripley has been leached of all her relatability, replaced with weird alien-hybrid version of herself that really leaves no character relatibilty in the film at all, they all just seem like disconnected people that we just don't know or care about.

As I wrap up here, I will say this, if you are dying for some alien action, this will not satisfy you no matter HOW desperate you are. In fact you would be better off watching AVP, which, regardless of how weak a film it was, was WAY better than this crap.

Alien Resurection could have been a great movie if it wasn't for, the sloppy script, almost comic inspired gory deaths, glossy cinematograpy, bogus computer animation, and bad acting which just ruin this movie.

The fact I bought it last after the last ""Alien vs Predator - Requiem"" doesn't mean it is worse. This movie has one thing going for it, Sigourney Weaver. If it wasn't for her acting this movie would have no draw at all. Mediocre story, mundane acting from the rest the cast, and less than inspiring sets, effects, and music makes it one to slip into the player when you have watched ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Predator"", ""Predator 2"", and ""Alien vs Predator"" many, many times and need a change. If you enjoyed this you really aren't seeing enough good movies but maybe you will enjoy ""Alien vs Predator - Requiem"".

Plot: Mad scientists clone Ripley to get the alien that was inside of her from the previous episode on the maximum security prison. Later on Ripley stumbles upon a sick experiment to breed aliens with humans.

Opinion: At least Alien 3 had a chance to be great. This movie was dead once the plot unfolded within the first ten minutes. Sigourney Weaver telegraphs her performance in, and the rest of the cast does the same. Wynonna Ryder unconvincingly plays an android that was sent on the ship to protect the gung-ho crew aboard and supposedly destroy Ripley. The special efforts are the only thing this movie has going for it. Whereas Alien and Aliens had more of a story plus great special effects and chills going for it. Alien Resurrection plays like one of those campy B-movies of the 80s. Mindless action sequences, asinine plots and plotholes, corny one-liners and leaps in logic. Why would anyone clone someone to get an alien? The last 20 minutes with the alien/human spawn with an attachment to Ripley comes off a pathetic attempt to tug at the heartstrings with all the subtleties of a sledgehammer.

935878,2,6304844948,"To put the following in perspective, I consider the first movie (Alien) to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made. The sequel (Aliens) was a well-crafted action-adventure film that is excellent for what it is, and Alien 3 was a failed ""art film"" that left a bad taste in my mouth for aesthetic AND cinematic reasons.

Until recently, I'd avoided seeing Alien Resurrection (hereafter ""A-Res"") because of the overwhelmingly negative feedback from ""professional"" reviews and friends alike. However, a newer friend of mine who worships all things Joss Whedon (the guy wrote the screenplay) insisted that A-Res was a ""misunderstood masterpiece"" that needed to be viewed as a campy, self-parodying dark comedy. She also warned me that this intent was largely undermined by a director who chose to ignore Whedon's vision and play the movie fairly straight-faced and serious, the result being that much (though not all) of the allegedly-intended effect was lost. Despite that, my friend said, with some creative thinking you could still see what Whedon was going for, and it was worth the effort.

With that in mind, she loaned me a copy, and I attempted to suspend prejudice and watch it with as close to an open mind as possible.

Alas, that didn't work, and even early on it seemed as if the movie was daring me to find any redemptive qualities in it. Mission: failure.

This film is a mess on so many levels. The direction/cinematography was at best lackluster, and the performances unmemorable. Notably, Sigourney Weaver is blatantly collecting a paycheck by just being there, and Brad Dourif (who usually turns in solid ""crazy"" performances) seemed to phone this one in as well. The film trades the tense horror of the first film and the action of the second for a gore factor that was as unnecessary as it was unconvincing. As to the last, the special effects were one of the weakest aspects in this, especially the ""new"" elements to the alien species' mythology. My friend insists that the effects were intentionally ""so bad they're good"" but honestly, I don't see that, and don't buy her defense.

One of the biggest weaknesses in the whole thing was Whedon's screenplay. The film begins with a central premise: in the future, scientists can clone Ripley back into existence (which I have no technical problem with) and that somehow this clone will have an alien queen inside her (which I have a huge problem with). That just strikes me as lazy script-writing, especially if anyone is familiar with William Gibson's proposed (and wisely rejected) screenplay for Alien 3 which has a suspiciously similar element at its center. Even putting aside a fatally flawed premise, the overall story was so lame it would need a wheelchair to get around, and conspicuously missing were any type of dialogue ""zingers"" that would indicate this was somehow the ""dark comedy"" my friend suggested.

If A-Res *is* a ""dark comedy"" it can only be by sheer accident, much in the way people consider Battlefield Earth or Manos: The Hands Of Fate to be ""comedies."" Personally, I have a soft spot for such ""so bad it's good"" offerings, but this one was ""so bad it's embarrassing."" Others might be more forgiving and might get some chuckles out of the sheer awfulness of it all, which in all honesty is the only way I can see this being enjoyed.

935954,4,6304844948,"I enjoyed Alien Resurrection for everything it was worth. It was good space opera in the old tradition of space pirates. I gave it 4 stars for special effects and an original plot (please read on). This movie was obviously not as good as Alien or Aliens but was far more enjoyable than Alien 3.

Although this film was made against the better judgment of the original studio writers, the studio brought in an excellent young writer who thoughtfully developed the script and dealt with the issue of resurrecting Ripley. In order for the film to not appear like just another knock off they also brought in French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN) for his original visual style and other wonderful French artists and technicians who had worked with Jean-Pierre on prior films.

The underwater scenes brought an entirely new dimension to the Alien as an aquatic film creature. Between the underwater use of a full body Alien garment for the actor to wear during close ups and great animation effects the water medium was entirely new and worked very successfully for the Alien.

I also enjoyed seeing Ripley getting a chance to use her brawn as well as her brain in dealing with her human shipmates and the creatures. If you felt badly for Ripley during the first three films, Alien Resurrection allows her to out perform humans and Aliens with the best attributes of both.

I also found very plausible the sci-fi concept of cloning Ripley and having her recall her former memories as a benefit of genetic linking with the Alien blood line. This clarifies the original films ""survivor"" concept for the creature which could arguably recall every battle and war ever waged by predecessors in order to follow only winning strategies in the future.

I definitely reckon the third movie was my favourite, but I'm still kinda disappointed about Resurrection.

I'm still in two minds about it. I really think they should have ended it with Aliens 3 - I won't go into how they brought back Ripley, but I think, personally, that it was a cop out, and seemed too easy. I'm still not sure I understand how the alien came back either, it just seemed too easy.

Apart from that, the rest of the movie was great. That's my main gripe with the movie. I still didn't like Ripley's character in this - I didn't like her in the first movie either, but her character was developed in two and three. In this, they seem to have reverted her back to her original portrayal. Although my heart did go out to her at the end. Wow. What an ending.

The cast in this was excellent. Winona Ryder was an excellent casting choice, as was Ron Perlman (my birthday twin), and although it bugged me for ages where I knew Michael Wincott from (Robin Hood Princes of Thieves people), he was brilliant too, if not a little cocky.

This has some of the best scenes in all of the movies. Ron Perlman hanging just by his legs on a ladder - ouch. And the underwater scenes, in which all actors were alleged to have trouble (including Winona, who has a fear of water), were just amazing. I was holding my breath quite a lot. For some reason, gimme water in a movie, and I love it. But I hate being in it myself. (I must have drowned in a previous life.)

Apart from the disappointment of the way Ripley was brought back, I still did enjoy Resurrection, although it did dampen my excitement a little bit. They could have found a better way to bring her back, or not done the movie at all. My favourites of the Alien series has been part 3 and this, and I'd definitely rewatch those two. This was made in 1997, surely it's time to revisit it? Would Sigourney Weaver come back now? I doubt it! It's a very open ending as well, which left me not feeling empty, but relatively satisfied.

ALIEN RESURRECTION has a host of great lines, many of them containing words that makes it impossible to repeat here. But you have to love an exchange like:

Johner: So, I hear you, like, ran into these things before?
Ripley: Yeah.
Johner: What did you do?
Ripley: I died.

Or when Ripley is talking to someone who has had one of the aliens implanted in his chest for gestation:

Purvis: WHAT'S [expletive deleted] INSIDE ME?
Ripley: There's a monster in your chest. These guys hijacked your ship, and they sold your cryo-tube to this... human, and he put an alien inside of you. It's a really nasty one. And in a few hours, it's gonna burst its way through your rib cage, and you're gonna die. Any questions?
Purvis: Who are you?
Ripley: I'm the monster's mother.

Or this great line:

Distephano: I thought you were dead!
Ripley: Yeah, I get that a lot.

This was a good movie -- but the writers missed a great opportunity to present science fiction with a way-things-ought-to-be theme. Life as it SHOULD and OUGHT to be.
These alien creatures attack and begin killing members of the crew on a space ship, along with some guests in transit and Officer Ripley. Ripley takes charge, and leads everyone in the effort to simply kill these creatures. In the end Ripley and her gang of cowboys prevailed, and all the creatures were dead (or are they?).
The writers overlooked an excellent chance to demonstrate how life SHOULD be. When Ripley and her compatriots were first attacked, they should have asked themselves, ""Why do these creatures hate us?"" And then they should have spent a significant amount of time examining their own behavior, to determine what faults or misdeeds of theirs had provoked the creatures to attack and kill them. Next, Ripley and her bunch should have sought to form a coalition of some sort, dealing with a space equivalent of the United Nations, to pass resolutions against the creatures' violent behavior -- not against the creatures themselves, mind you, but only condemning their behavior. Then, they should have sent inspectors to the creatures, to monitor compliance with the resolutions. If the creatures had continued killing then, by golly, they could have given those inspectors more time.
THAT is how this story should have played out -- with the creatures living according to their own cultural/religious rules, and everyone else having to accommodate the fact that the creatures simply are going to kill/terrorize people from time to time. That is the creatures' culture, and it was up to the others to understand, appreciate and accept that culture. The sad fact is, Ripley and her people did not make enough of an effort to appease these creatures. They showed absolutely NO signs of tolerance, diversity, inclusion or compassion. Well, that's not wholly true. That character portrayed by Brad Dorff was extremely compassionate in his last scene toward the end of the movie, praising the creature as ""beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"" just before the thing bit off his head.

If you've watched the first three you have to see this one.

You might have to remind yourself that James Cameron also created the movie Titanic (which I think breaks any cred he had as a director).

Where the 2nd ""Aliens"" movie is slow moving and puts more focus on suspense, this movie is action packed.  It's very visually pleasing and looks great on an DVD with HDMI upscaling.  ""Resurrection"" features a screen play by Joss Whedon (of Firefly fame) and includes Winona Ryder as a very hot looking robot.  Sigourney Weaver is very entertaining to watch and her character, Ellen Ripley, is intriguing and has a different ""alien-like"" quality to her.  Before where she was a pretty weak pilot she is now a rough neck.

I must say that this movie is full of tension; it hardly ever lets up (much like the second film). But it's clearly the creepiest, weirdest, goriest, and nastiest of the franchise. It's overkill. There's no solid story, and it's all becoming too familiar in its endless variations of the tired 'escape the monsters' formula. I am surprised at how many people give this movie four or five stars. It's not worthy.

Ripley's manicure manages to stay nice all through the harrowing ordeals. Not a crack or a chip. I nearly laugh when they show closeup shots of her hands. Didn't the director or any of the cast or crew notice this during the rushes?

But how about that disturbing, gruesome, gutwrenching scene before the end? Too much. (Shudder.) I'd rather watch ""Sophie's Choice"".

Of all the Alien films, I always gravitate back to the first, the original suspense-filled monster movie that created the whole egg/facehugger/birth/acid blood/alien concepts.

It is fairly brilliant, frightening, and purposely slow in building its tension to a wonderful climax.

Mixing Whedon's trademark creativity with Jeunet's vibrant style seems like the perfect remedy for those who disliked ""Alien3.""  Unfortunately, it's not.  Written shortly before he created ""Buffy,"" Whedon's script reads like a comic book, sorely lacking the structure of the series' previous entries.  It's in Jeunet's directing where the film really plummets, though.  The actors seem to have had little guidance (Jeunet didn't speak a word of English at the time the film was made), the performances are over-the-top to the point of being cartoonish, and Jeunet's style is all about in-your-face grotesque imagery.

Here's the story: 200 years after ""Alien3,"" a group of military scientists have successfully cloned Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and extracted the baby alien queen from within her.  Also, they've experimented by combining her human blood with alien blood.  The result is a far more out-there, carefree, bizarre Ripley, devoid of the humanity that made the character so appealing in the other films.  That's not to say that this new Ripley isn't appealing.  On the contrary, she's quite fun, thanks to an enthusiastic and oddball performance by Weaver.  The supporting cast includes Winona Ryder, who shines as a determined young space pirate with a secret, Ron Perlman, future ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-S-I/dp/B00008972G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.S.I.</a>"" star Gary Dourdan, Dan Hedaya, and Brad Dourif, who is creepy as usual.

Comparing these films, Ridley Scott's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>"" and Fincher's ""Alien3"" are the suspense-based, claustrophobic, ""nowhere to run"" entries in the series, while James Cameron's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>"" and this movie are the action-packed, shoot 'em up entries.  Jeunet knows how to direct a sci-fi film, and it would appear he knows how to direct an action film as well (his style is actually similar to scribe Joss Whedon's in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B000Q9IZ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>"").  Unfortunately, he has no idea how to direct an ""Alien"" film.  It's this disregard for the previous films that makes ""Alien: Resurrection"" seem like your everyday sci-fi thriller.

As this is the most recent of the solo ""Alien"" films (excluding Paul W.S. Anderson's foolish ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVP-Alien-vs-Predator/dp/B000AP04P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a>""), it has some more bombastic visual effects than its predecessors.  However, they aren't always better - in fact, these are the weakest effects of the series.  Granted, there are some highlights, such as the utterly horrifying, foul alien hybrid (and his stomach-churning demise), or any scene featuring the alien queen.  But there's frequent use of CGI, and part of what made the titular beasts so frightening in the earlier movies was the realism that came with using a guy in a suit.  That realism is lost through this film's CGI effects, and with it dies much of the terror contained in the previous films.

So who's to blame for this movie's many problems?  Many a finger points to Joss Whedon.  Whedon has defended himself by saying that though not much from his original screenplay was changed, the finished film follows it very loosely: actors speak the lines wrong, scenes are filmed wrong, everything looks wrong.  Even a glance through Whedon's script proves that, in the hands of the right director, it could've been a decent film.  Regardless, it's too much like an action comic and not enough like an ""Alien"" movie.

However, most of the blame should go to the director.  In the introduction to his ""special edition"" cut of the film presented in the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Quadrilogy/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Quadrilogy</a>"" boxset, Jean-Pierre Jeunet says that he is extremely proud of the movie in any form.  Sadly, there's nothing to be proud of here; truthfully, this film is a disgrace.  How odd that the director who brought us ""Amelie,"" one of the best and most refreshing films ever made, should be responsible for such a turgid movie as this.  And turgid it is: ""Alien: Resurrection"" is unquestionably the worst of the ""Alien"" movies.  It's a cartoon version of the ""Alien"" saga, filled with drifting actors and a shoestring plot.  It's gross, frequently confusing, and just plain weird (take, for example, a scene in which Ripley apparently has sex with an alien).

At its end, ""Alien: Resurrection"" is a perfect example of what happens when foolish studios keep series going after they've run their course.  ""Alien3"" would have been a fitting close for what may be the greatest science fiction series of all time, but instead we're left with this stupid, dull mess of a film.  It's ironic that through ""Alien: Resurrection,"" the title a reference to what execs planned to do the saga after its near-death through ""Alien3,"" the powers that be unwittingly killed off the series.  Ten years after the film's release, there's been no ""Alien 5,"" and with the overwhelmingly-negative response to Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Alien vs. Predator,"" it seems likely that the ""Alien"" saga, at least on its own, has reached its end.",1181779200,2,6198,6.257950530035336
936048,4,6304844948,"When ""Alien 3"" was released to theaters with lackluster results, it left both the studio and fans wondering if there was any need for further installments in the franchise or had it simply run its course.  After 5 years of wondering whether we had seen the last of those nasty creatures known simply as `aliens', 20th Century Fox released what they hoped would be their redemption for the failure of their previous effort with the appropriately titled ""Alien: Resurrection"".

""Alien: Resurrection"" picks up approximately 200 years after the events of ""Alien 3"" a group of scientists have found a way to clone Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and successfully remove the Queen that had been inside of her.  But this clone Ripley isn't exactly the Ripley we remember, during the cloning process her DNA became spliced with that of the alien's, leaving Ripley with the ability to sense their presence and also giving her enhanced strength and stamina.  When a team of smugglers come aboard carrying human cargo to be used to breed new aliens, they quickly discover that the creatures are far more dangerous than they expected, and much smarter too (thanks to Ripley's DNA).  In no time at all, the aliens have found a way to get loose aboard the space ship, and not surprisingly, they make quick work of most of the crew, save for a few who managed to survive along with the smugglers and Ripley.  Now Ripley must decide whether to save herself or fall back into her old habits and destroy the aliens that have plagued her for years and years.

After ""Alien 3"" brought the franchise to its knees, this fourth installment allowed the `Alien' saga to once again stand tall and become a film series that 20th Century Fox could once again be proud of.  ""Alien: Resurrection"" brought back the horror and ominous atmosphere that Ridley Scott had used so successfully in ""Alien"", and packed exhilarating action sequences that reminds you of the glory days of James Cameron's ""Aliens"", all wrapped up together with a very strong, well-written script that tied up the series nicely and left fans with a satisfying movie experience that allowed them to forget about the less-than-stellar ""Alien 3"".  I was happy that the creative team behind ""Alien: Resurrection"" decided to incorporate story elements that occurred in ""Alien 3"" rather than ignoring the film altogether like some franchises do with lackluster installments.  Of course that may have been a decision heavily backed by the studio in an attempt to save face for their tampering with the previous movie, but that's just my assumption.

The cast was comprised of great actors who all turned in excellent performances, Michael Wincott, Winona Ryder, and Ron Perlman were by far the biggest standouts as far as the new members to the franchise are concerned.  Of course, the biggest star of the movie was Sigourney Weaver, who was having much more fun here than she did in ""Alien 3"", and her performance was evidence of that, as she appeared to breathe new life into her character Ripley.  I believe she truly enjoyed getting to play the much darker side of the character, a side that had not been seen in any of the previous installments, and made the movie even more enjoyable, since you never knew for sure what Ripley was going to do from one moment to the next.

The special effects were the best in the franchise, and the decision to use CGI at times to create the aliens was nice, giving them much more fluidity and freedom to their actions.  But even with all the great CGI work, the practical effects employed in this movie, and throughout this entire franchise for that matter, is by far some of the best in all of Hollywood, and should be held as the standard for what all other monster movies should aspire to.

If you were one of the many fans that was disappointed, and perhaps disillusioned with the franchise by ""Alien 3"", then you should definitely give ""Alien: Resurrection"" a look, as it will quickly redeem the series in anyone's eyes, and it serves as an excellent ending (at least so far) to a terrific science-fiction/horror franchise that spanned almost 20 years.

""Alien: Resurrection"" is rated R for violence and language.",1181347200,,4187,4.817294281729428

I remember being very excited when this came out for two reasons. I love the Alien movies and this is the first one I got to see in the theaters. It was very well done all around IMO. The acting was great as usual and the special efects were outstanding for the day. Even in 10 years it amaing how much CG has improved. This was a great movie then and even better now with this release. While not a directors cut it adds more depth to the film and the ending gives a much better finale than the orriginal ending.

936052,4,6304844948,"I'm somewhat new to the Alien series.  Since I wasn't even born before the first movie made its appearance in the 1970s I was too young even after Alien Resurrection hit theaters in 1997.  I did see bits of the movies since they represent an epitome of science fiction filming, but still a child until the late 1990s (I was born in 1985) I didn't care to see something so graphic and horror-based.  I had recently purchased the second film Aliens and was impressed by how convincingly Weaver portrayed Ripley, and how interesting the plot line was (I happen to find the first film eerie, but a little boring at first).  The third feature, Alien 3, was definitely scary, but was my least favorite.  Alien Resurrection is one of the best in the movies.  The film has great effects (for its time), and once again Weaver portrays a believable character--in an interesting sense, the mutant alien (part original Alien and part Ripley) almost comes off a little sympathetic in the final look between Ripley's character and said beast, with its sad eyes looking at its mother.  Definitely one of the better Alien movies, although I doubt it completely takes the top spot from Aliens.",1178323200,,1176,4.735294117647059
936053,3,6304844948,"Alien Resurrection is surely not the best in the Alien series, but I don't think it's the worst either.  Most will disagree, but I find it to be a much better sequel than Alien3. In Alien 3 nothing happens. I like that it picks up right where the second left off, but the characters she encounters this time around are all disposable, except the doctor, and they kill him off way too early. What was the point of that? The third is the worst in the series.

At least Resurrection pushed the mythology further and had far better characters and situations: 200 years in the future, more Aliens than in 3, having an infected person join their party (which was stupid of them but still keeps things interesting) the room with all of Ripley's failed clones and how they continued to progress cloning her was by far one of the creepiest parts of the entire series. Not only that but they never make mention of Earth as far as I can remember in the first 3 movies, but not only do they make mention of it in this one, but we finally get to see what's become of it in this future, which I can see why that would bother some fans, ruining the mystery, but after that many movies over that many years, it seemed like the right thing to do, to finally answer that curiousity.

Ripley's character I find a lot more complex in this installment. There's so much more history behind this movie than in the others, so there's a lot more to draw from, and she has an attitude like she's seen it all before and Aliens have become her life now. I thought about that partway through watching this one, how everytime she wakes up in between each movie, it just keeps escalating and she even makes the statement herself that no matter how bad the dreams are, she doesn't fear them anymore because everytime she wakes up, its always worse. That's by far one of my favorite lines of hers throughout the franchise. What a terrible life she lives. And how ironic is it that she was the one who never wanted to let them back onto the ship in the first movie. I really do like her character in this movie, she's the most developed than in any other Alien. I just don't understand why everyone's so down on Resurrection.",1175385600,2,2191,4.378378378378378

Turns out, much better than expected. I was never bored, which is unusual for me and action movies.

And I found it funny, well acted, beautiful visually, and with fresh ideas, surprisingly.

Winona Ryder is lovely, and Sigourney was no less hot for being 47 when she made it.

The creatures looked totally real, even when they had to be CG. I liked how they finally moved away from the silly humanoid body the original alien had. Ridley Scott said in the commentary to the first one that it was humanoid because it was adaptive to the host, but it feels like a justification for the fact that it was either that or stop-motion, which would have looked even worse. (See Robocop II.) And of course there was the final creature, which looked even more different, I liked it.",1162512000,5,939,4.538461538461538
936137,2,6304844948,"In 1979 Ridley Scott released Alien, one of the most elegantly crafted Sci-Fi Horror films ever made.  Working closely with a number of visual artists (most famously H.R. Giger), Scott managed to put together a work that seethes with moody atmosphere and would become a essential classic.  Everything here works: the cinematography is beautiful, the story's pacing deliberate, Jerry Goldsmith's score is haunting and gorgeous(easily one of the film's best qualities), the suspense and mystery of it all... hell, when I watch the film I'm struck by how lonely and horrifying space must be even without merciless killing machines on the loose.  Other films in the genre have nothing on Alien in terms of setting a mood, the creepiness and isolation are so palpable.  The creature effects are simple and the quick glimpses, close shots and lighting make it frightening, human-in-a-latex-suit though they may be.  Of course the effects aren't up to the level we've come to expect in  a post The Abyss/Jurassic Park/Lord of the Rings world, but I'd argue Alien's strengths far outweigh it's weaknesses, and that modern Sci-Fi/fantasy blockbusters can't really say that.  Big budgets don't always make for a good film.  Which brings me, finally, to Alien Resurrection, a movie that couldn't possibly be less true to it's roots.

Aside from the inclusion of the series' main character and actress, 1997's Alien Resurrection looks and feels like the latest Sci-Fi Channel high budget TV series, and anyone with a smattering of taste will recognize this as a bad thing.  Far removed from the quiet tension and human drama of Alien,  Resurrection is a brainlessly slick action movie from the start; a fact proven time and time again by lame one-liners: ""Earth man.  What a s##thole,"" and the cheesy fight scenes everyone seems to get involved in.  The lush production, light years ahead of what was possible for a low-budget film in 1979, does nothing to keep Resurrection from resembling just about every other modern-day John Carpenteresque space ""thriller.""  Visual and script cliches abound here and the special effects do  not pick up the slack.  True, the alien design has evolved beyond simple rubber suits, but at this point they are no more mysterious than the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park, and they certainly aren't scary any more; they barely qualify as gross.  Perhaps all of this is what you expect when effects are taken out of the hands of artists and placed into the hands of computer technicians.  Not to say that there isn't an art to creating computer graphics, but... well I'll save that argument for another time.  That comment aside, a good portion of the cg, especially in the underwater scenes is sub par anyway, and few things kill a modern day Sci-Fi movie faster than poorly done computer animation.

Speaking of mediocrity, the poorly designed ""new"" Alien creature at the end (humorously enough, a man in a rubber suit) resembles the titular character from the movie Pumpkinhead a little too much for it's own good.  All of this is nitpicking though.  The real heart breaker here is that Resurrection's director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, has made some very very good films in France (Amelie, City of Lost Children) and certainly his particular visual style is evident the lighting and in his casting choices.  But in this instance he seemed to have tried very hard to make an ""American"" style movie, commenting negatively on the state of affairs in Hollywood today.  His other movies are great.  The other Alien movies are great.  This movie is disposable.  Bottom line, see it if you like cheap action, but don't waste money on it.",1162252800,5,3647,4.995033112582782
936138,2,6304844948,"Every Alien installment has had a new director at the helm, also bringing about a new style for the series. While Ridley Scott made a more clastrophobic sci-fi horror, James Cameron went all out and made a big combat movie and David Fincher made a more bleaker film which looked better and more ""arty"". After that film's failure, people thought the series was doomed and wrote it off until a 4th Alien film was announced with Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the helm, director of Delicatessen, City of Lost Children and the later film Amelie. So is it good? Heh...nope. Is there any redeeming quality to it at all? Well let's just say this: you know the film's in trouble when you actually have to think what was good about it.

200 years after the events of Alien3, the ship Auriga has been secretly cloning Lieutenant Ripley who died with an Alien queen inside her. Well after several failures, they finally successfully cloned her, who happens to be carrying an Alien queen. Using live people for guinea pigs, they get them ""impregnated"" with the alien. But of course aliens don't like being caged so they manage to escape so it's up to Ripley and the crew of the ship Betty to get out of the ship.

One thing that was always great about this series was its emphasis on the presence of the aliens rather than full blown shots, which then helped the film when there wasn't any gore, allowing your imagination to go into overdrive. That all changed with this film since people are dispatched in really gruesome ways including one alien who has an unfortunate encounter involving a window. Instead of being a great sci-fi horror film, it turned into a generic splatterhouse movie. While it is a new direction, the over-the-topness of it just kills it.

The set design and the look of the film though was starting to get better, relying on dim corridors and small lighting, much like the first film. And an action scene involving an underwater set is quite thrilling and the aliens certainly never looked better. But ultimately these are kind of superficial since a great scary experience like Alien or a blast like Aliens is sorely missing here. And while she is a cutie, Winona Ryder was severely miscast here.

Should you watch it? Oh man I have no clue what to say. I guess it's for curiousity purposes only but don't think you're going to see an Alien/Aliens experience here. It's not even an Alien3.",1156636800,6,2394,4.652482269503546

936220,5,6304844948,"I'm not typically a horror fan, and I enjoy the Alien series mostly for the science fiction, so the somewhat gory nature of some parts of this film (A:R) did nothing for me.

The film had quite a lot of good action, some morbid humor, and quite a lot of gore. Spoilers below.

I'll summarize the film in one paragraph (spoilers): Ripley gets cloned into being again 200 years after she died by a military that wants the aliens inside her. Ripley has inhuman strength and acidic blood because of some alien DNA that remained inside her. The aliens get loose and many people die. The alien queen gives birth to a human-xenomorph hybrid, which kills the queen because it believes Ripley to be its mother. Ripley kills the baby hybrid on the way to earth, where she and the android Call discuss what will happen next sitting side by side surveying a desolate earth.

Many people criticize A:R on specific points, almost all with an eye towards the first two alien films, which I think is somewhat of a disservice to this film. In its own way, it is as deserving of praise. Why? One person in the GREAT extra disc of A:R noted that the Alien films were special because they were not just sequels, but that they were the individual expressions of each of the  directors. Viewed as a WHOLE SET, the series is astoundingly consistent, consistently well-done, and a legitimate tour de force.

I can say this because, like many people, I had tended to like the first 2 movies because they were more ""mainstream"" in terms of how the directors portrayed the story, but I found out by rewatching the next two films that they were just as good (in a different way), and sometimes just as emotionally wrenching (e.g. the scene in A:R with that cripple hanging on for dear life to the ladder rung as he was slowly dragged lower by the combined weight of his dying friend and an Alien was extremely emotional and well done)

Some points before I go:

- Like many others, I believe the addition of the hybrid ""baby"" was a mistake, but there was some emotional tug there at the end when Ripley had to say sorry for killing it. In fact, unlike the death of Newt, who died offscreen, the death of that abomination was somewhat affecting even, since it was crying out for its mother in the end!

- The extra DVD in this collector's edition is a must have. I was more interested in this extra DVD than I was of the extra DVDs of the first 2 alien films, not only because of the bittersweet tang that you could see in the eyes of the creators when they realized that their work was not being universally appreciated, but because there are some jewels here showing some of the scenes they shot, including the terrific underwater fight scene (where the actors had to overcome claustrophobia, possible drowning, and REALLY nasty water - the water was used continuously for weeks and people were inadvertantly peeing in it - for the weeks it took to get that scene done), and the basketball scene (where Ripley did a real-life basketball ""miracle"". Seeing these behind the scenes episodes make you appreciate the actual movie a heck of a lot more!

- I believe the producers ended this movie with a future Alien 5 in mind. Just watch the end scene and you can almost envision an earth-based Alien 5, with soldiers hunting Ripley and Call and the others. I hope they do this. AvP was a REAL mess on almost all counts (with almost no artistic value), and it's sad that there will be an AvP 2 and perhaps never an Alien 5

In the end, I encourage you to open your eyes to other ways of SEEING the Alien universe beyond the somewhat straight-forward perceptions of the first 2 Alien films. There is a dark beauty there, perhaps one more rewarding than first perceived.",1142208000,3,3736,4.5051698670605616

The story of Ripley being half alien is a very interesting thing. She can use their own techniques against them, and does. The Xenomorphs themselves looked fantastic, they look even better than they do in Alien vs. Predator; they are very detailed in this movie.

I don't have much to say, but I do have to say that I did like this movie. It had the horror element and a few other ingredients I felt that were missing from Alien 3. I like this flick; it's a ok in my book.",1139875200,2,740,4.2785714285714285

Running Time:  109 minutes

Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and gore, some grotesque images, and for language.

""Alien: Resurrection"" continues the story of Ellen Ripley after her sacrifice at the end of the third movie. While this fourth film functions in some respect as something of an addendum, it does do what the otherwise excellent third ""Alien"" flick did not: expands upon the aliens biology and psychology and gives us some interesting new insights into the creature.  It has been nearly 200 years since Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) sacrificed herself on the prison planet Fiorina 161. In this space-set adventure she's resurrected by a group of scientists (among them Brad Dourif) and the military, headed up by General Perez (Dan Hedaya). The idea behind her resurrection is to use alien D.N.A in her blood to create an Alien Queen and a new Army of alien soldiers. Naturally, this plan backfires and the aliens are loosed just as a team of pirates (among them Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder) attacks and boards the ship.

On completion of this movie, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet rightly paid homage to ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott and the alien designer H.R Giger, saying that they were the original artists and those that follow are just artisans. That is a very true sentiment, as alot of the story and character elements in this one are borrowed or are least familiar from previous instalments. There the tough grunts (the pirates in this picture equivalent to the Marines from ""Aliens""), ambiguous characters with hidden agendas or motives, and the onrunning theme of the humans out to exploit the deadly aliens for their own purposes. Unlike the previous three movies, this film is set near Earth, providing the basis for the film's finale.  Performances are good enough for this kind of fare but Ripley, predictably, has the most interesting and best-developed role. The combination of both human and alien D.N.A in her blood has gifted her with some unusual abilities, bleeding acid blood and being able to scale walls with ease. This in turn renders makes Ripley's relationship to the aliens far more intimate than previously envisaged and comes up with a few unexpected surprises.

Elsewhere, Brad Dourif makes a creepy impression as one of the scientists, communicating very well his characters obsessed fascination and awe of the aliens. However, Dan Hedaya should have perhaps been used more as General Perez, Perlman and Michael Wincott are unmemorable, and Winona Ryder fails to exploit fully the dramatic opportunities in her role.  Visually, the film is impressive. Like David Fincher and Ridley Scott before him, Jeunet has an eye for the gloomy and portentous and it shows here. The set designs, with their colours of rust, red and brown are beautifully reminiscent of the prison from the third film whilst creating a feel unique to the picture. The special effects here are a welcome mix of traditional and CGi, although neither is overused to detrimental effect.  There are some interesting and memorable moments to behold here. The first is the scene where a scientist eyes up an alien in the laboratory and the camera pans back to reveal the Alien Queen in all her glory. It is a frightening moment and suggestive of the horror of the experiments. There is also an inventive action scene where the aliens are fought underwater. The finale is strangely moving, as is the last scene (a slow-moving coda) on Earth.  ""Alien: Resurrection"" is not too bad an effort and does expand on the themes of the first two films in ways that the third film did not.",1135987200,2,3782,5.011164274322169
936223,1,6304844948,"All right, 1 star is probably slightly harsh, but 2 seems a little generous, so whatever.  To be blunt, 'Alien Resurrection' has a multitude of problems.  First of all, where are the damn aliens?  This movie has nowhere near enough alien action.  It is an 'Alien' movie, right?  Next, the new, semi-evil whacked out half-alien clone Ripley- not cool.  Ripley wasn't exactly lovable before, but she was a good enough action hero.  Also, all the other characters except for Ron Perlman- also not cool.  They get real bad, from the irritating dork captain of the ship to the inexplicable Winona Ryder android.  And the human-alien at the end? Holy frickin hell!  My friend who saw it before told me all about how ridiculous it was, so that when it actually showed up I was slightly underwhelmed.  It is, nevertheless, terrible,  and I can't imagine how shocked and disturbed I would've been upon seeing had I not know anything before hand.  However, the way it gets wasted is absolutely classic.

Still, it all comes down to the lack of aliens and action.  The aliens are still very cool no doubt about it, and they look good here, but they just don't do anything.  In fact, nobody does anything in this movie, and, to the best of my recollection, nothing ever actually occurrs either.  They just sat around, and eventually were wet for a while, and then there was a silly alien and than it's over.  Again, the only high point is Ron Perlman, who always amuses me.  Definitely the worst of the series.  AvP was silly, of course, but whaddya expect.  Not great, but at least mediocre and way more entertaining than this.  And I think 'Alien 3' to be slightly underrated.  It's pretty screwed up, but it's got some neat stuff and I actually like some of the characters. (Though it did commit the utterly unpardonable sin of killing off Newt and Hicks between sequels.  Ugh, I'll never get over that.)  But whatever, this review is about 'Alien Resurrection', and 'Alien Resurrection' is very bad.  The End.

It's now another 200 years later after the last Alien flick, and even though Ripley is dead, that won't stop Hollywood, who simply clone her and send her onto a ship that has helpfully scooped up some Aliens in order to, yes, study them because of their value.

Value, indeed.  Soon the ship is populated with some more Marine grunts, Ripley, Winona, and idiot scientists.  The aliens are kept in captivity until the laws of movie physics dictate that they'll escape through ingenious use of acid blood, and before you know it, we have a blood-acid-milky fluid-bath on our hands that begs for a gigantic yawn.

The movie looks great, though.  Really great.  The effects are fantastic, but as usual, we see way too much of the aliens.  We see way too much of anything, and it becomes clear that everyone will die, so why care about the characters?  They exist to be chopped up, have their heads split open, burnt, blown up, etc, etc, with lots of gore and head-crushing violence that employed an army of effects people, and to what end?  The only survivors ensure this is a nice, PC-ending, and of course we have more sequel set-up action.  Hello, Alien v Predator and the inevitable Alien 5.

They won't be able to touch the original, nor Aliens, which still blows this one away.  Also, to gripe, the technology and the logic do not make any sense...too many holes concerning the time, the aliens themselves, etc.  How come 500 or so years later after Alien, the same things are happening?  There have bene no improvements in technology?  The same evil corporations run the universe?  The movie is a brain-dead festival for film theorists and popcorn fans, but it's unnecessary, and it's a shame.  Boooooring.  Nice DVD though, 80,000 extras to ensure the movie was way more trouble than it was worth.

But I gripe.  It is a decent enough popcorn flick and it's dark, sinister (and very, very violent) eye candy, but it can't hold a candle to any of its predecessors.  So there, good enough fare on a slow night (preferably with a six-pack).

Recommended for completists, of course, but really, just buy the full box set, soon to be re-released with 10 more discs of extra material.",1135036800,3,2399,4.741545893719807
936225,4,6304844948,"This is a bad news, good news review.  First let's get the bad news out of the way -- this is yet another Ripley chases or is chased by aliens all over a ship.  No sexy tee shirts this time, but once again Sigourney Weaver proves that acting still is an important part of good horror.  And that's all the bad part there is, actually.  And what would you watch an Alien film for anyway except the alien chasing... and the tee shirts, of course.  On the good side is the remarkable fact that, despite four films that are much the same in their basics, once again, the writers have managed to pull an original plot out of thin air.  This amazes me.  How many series go to 4 films and manage to be different each time?  Maybe StarTrek, and that's about it.

Having fought the aliens, slept for 50 years only to wake up and fight the aliens, only to crash on a prison planet fight the aliens and get obliterated.  Ripley now gets to be cloned and, you guessed it, fight the aliens.  This time, though, it's not Ripley that the secret military project wants, but the alien queen that seems to prefer Ripley as a host.  Once the queen is removed, Ripley is allowed to live in almost an offhand manner.  This, as we all know is not the best strategy with Ripley, especially since a little bit of the queen's genetic matter has gotten mixed in with our favorite space girl and she has become much meaner and leaner.

Along comes a space pirate with a load of folks in suspended animation to be used as alien flowerpots, and the story is off and running.  The crew of the ship, which includes Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman of all people, barely misses a beat before the aliens the military are intent on training manage to escape and start trying to turn the experimental station into a fast food franchise.  Ripley, complete with super strength and acid blood goes into action.  As you can expect, survivors are few.

Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley in an entirely different way, deftly bringing out the little characteristics that mark her as part alien.  She's quieter, with carefully studied movements and a thin veneer of social skills over a very violent core.  Perlman plays Johner, a crew member so obnoxious that you almost have to love him.  Ryder is a little too timid in her part, especially since her real initial reason for joining the space pirate crew is to get as Ripley and kill her.  Of course nothing turns out quite as planned.  But in the claustrophobic spaces of the ship the tension keeps everything working, and the film is definitely worth seeing.  Even if it is just for the final scene on Earth.",1134518400,,2610,4.469344608879493
936226,3,6304844948,"I was very relieved, that Alien 4 did not become the second disappointment in the Alien series. The plot itself is acceptable, although creating another story on Lt. Ripley again was unnecessary. I think they should have thought of something else, but okay. The acting of the cast is quite well, but I
really didn't see the point of having Winona Ryder there. A rough and tough science fiction movie is no place for an adorable little girl. However the movie looks very exciting. The aliens seem to have picked up their scaryness of the second movie again, which was something that was lost in Alien 3.
Alien 4 cannot touch Alien nor Aliens, but if you enjoyed those
2 movies, you will enjoy this one as well. (SARR)",1131840000,2,716,4.558139534883721
936227,3,6304844948,"Sitting down for my first viewing of ""Alien: Resurrection,"" I was honestly expecting the worst movie of all time. From the way fans treat it and from the way critics bashed it when it came out, you would think this film is the cinematic equivalent to dog poop. Well, it's not a perfect film, and it's obviously the weakest link in the series (until, that is, ""Alien Vs. Predator,"" but that's a different rant), but it still carries some redeeming values and attempts to do something different than the original trilogy, all the while, managing to be entertaining.

Sigourney Weaver is back, but not to play Ripley. Here, she plays a clone of Ripley. 200 years after her death, the military has resurrected her (after many failed attempts) and the Alien-Queen inside of her, thinking they can train the creature to use to their advantage. Somehow, Ripley's clone seemingly remembers everything about the Aliens, and no one believes her when she tells them they are doomed. Thus, carnage ensues. ""Alien: Resurrection"" is surely the nastiest and goriest of all the movies, and the special effects surely deliver. The film itself is gorgeous, with breathtaking cinematography (check out the underwater scenes), and on a technical aspect, this movie is a winner. The story, however, leaves much to be desired. There are parts of this movie where I honestly had no idea what was going on. There are literally holes in this movie, it seems. The cast is great though, aside from Winona Ryder's usual wooden acting, genre favorites Brad Dourif (Chucky!) and Ron Pearlman (""Hellboy"") show up and steal the show.

 If you can get past the many plot holes (how can Ripley pull a face hugger off of herself, when it was impossible before?), it's a rather entertaining sci-fi/horror flick. If you are expecting the likes of James Cameron and Ridley Scott, then you will sadly be disappointed. ""Alien: Resurrection"" has more similarities with David Fincher's ""Alien 3."" Perhaps this flawed franchise would have survived better if they had stuck with one director? Who knows. But just give this movie a fair chance. I did, and I was pretty satisfied.",1128643200,3,2134,4.9222222222222225
936228,2,6304844948,"I have always been a big fan of the Alien quadrilogy.  Actually, make that the trilogy.  This 4th installment really seems tacked on to the first three, and should have been left in some writer's mind, not on the movie screen.  It really brings none of the originality that the first three enjoyed.  I would recommend renting this one only so that you've seen the complete set - otherwise, standing alone, it rates only as a passable alien/sci-fi movie.  That they brought Ripley back from blood found on the Alien3 planet is really an insult to the audience - she went out with a bang and proved her character in the first three, this movie just regurgitates a successful idea in the name of making some extra bucks for the studio.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125792000,12,986,4.45
936287,2,6304844948,"This movie plays more like a comic book than anything else.

The ONLY redeeming quality is the aliens themselves. So, if you're into special effects, watch it only for that.

Poor story, weak acting and lack of direction make this a waste. The only one of the alien series I found to be worse was Alien vs. Predator... they really should be ashamed of themselves. Neither this one nor vs. predator even have 'B' movie quality.",1125705600,10,426,4.592105263157895

Starring Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, Brad Dourif and written by Joss Whedon.  What more could you want?

Well, extras would have been nice.  Besides a 3 minute featurette, there is nothing else.  I would suggest checking out the collector's edition unless you just want the bare bones.  That's the ONLY reason I took away the star - because of the disc, not the film.",1124755200,,584,4.78
936289,3,6304844948,"I've watched every Alien movie and the first two were fantastic and the third was good. When ""Alien : Resurrection"" came out, I was expecting a great end to the Alien Saga. However, I found myself rather disappointed. Sigourney Weaver is certainly not at her best in this movie and at times the storyline was kind of lame. Allow me to elaborate...

Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago in ""Alien 3,"" as you probably know. In this movie she is brought back from the dead through the miracle of cloning. After many failed attempts at recreating Ripley, the scientists aboard some spacestation or ship (I can't recall), finally manage to successfully clone her. However, she is more aggressive and has great physical strength, possibly due to the fact that Ripley's clone contains Alien D.N.A , which is quite an interesting concept. Of course, the deep space facility is soon (predictably) overrun with Aliens. What ensues is much enjoyable human carnage and some inspired action scenes, including an underwater chase by a group of irate Aliens. To you this may sound pretty appealing, and alot of it is, but where this film fails is the overall execution...

I realise the director of this movie was different, so he had his own ideas for the Alien Saga. One thing that one must always recall in the Aliens Saga is the atmosphere created by the directors: in every movie, except this one, landscapes, spaceships, spacestations and planets are dark, dingy, dirty and foreboding. Weather and atmosphere add to the Alien experience. Although Jean-Pierre Jeunet has created a dark and somewhat dirty atmosphere in certain instances, he fails to create a true feeling of unrelenting and constant fear. It's quite difficult to explain, but I wasn't that scared in this movie. During the swim chase I definitely was, so points to ""Alien : Resurrection"" for that, but in most other instances, you just won't feel that afraid. This film loses the key fear factor evident in other Alien movies, which is a pity for fans of the Saga.

The ending is where this movie really falls. In my opinion, it was just kinda lame and well, rather funny I suppose. It was just hard to take it seriously I suppose, so the ending detracted heavily from the movie. In movies I consider the beginning, storyline and ending to be the key building blocks for a movie. The beginning was good, storyline pretty interesting, but the ending was literally laughable. It just seemed a little absurd in my opinion.

Overall, ""Alien : Resurrection,"" gets 3/5. It just doesn't come near the first two movies and is beaten by the third. I must admit that it must be terribly difficult to be the director to finish off a legendary Saga, but unfortunately Jean-Pierre Jeunet has managed a very average ending to an outstanding Journey of Sci-Fi and Horror. It's rated 18, but it may as well be 13. If you like your Sci-Fi rough, scary, tumultuos and full of adrenaline pumping action, this movie will no doubt disappoint you. This movie is for hardcore fans only...",1124150400,3,3017,4.796153846153846
936290,3,6304844948,"This movie was OK. It was my least favorite of the four Alien films  and of course was not nearly as good as the two Predator films or AVP, but it wasn't all that bad. I mean, there were some fights worth seeing, and a few funny moments. It was cool seeing the whole crew kill all the Aliens and then rocket back to Earth for a happy life there, and I liked the iron determination of all the heroes. Plus, there were some gory parts worth seeing, too. However, there was just not enough of a plot, graphics, or special effects for it to be in my top movies. But it wasn't bad.

936291,5,6304844948,"In 1979, director Ridley Scott gave us the film, ALIEN, the scariest film in all of Science Fiction history. In 1986, director James Cameron had directed the sequel entitled, ALIENS, where it became an even bigger success than the first film. In 1992, director David Fincher had directed, ALIEN 3, the least popular film in the whole series. But now, in 1997, director Jean-Pierre Jaunet had given us: ALIEN RESURRECTION, the fourth installment to the ALIEN series.

  200 years ago, Ellen Ripley had died, after being impregnated with an Alien queen inside of her. But, 200 years later, doctors have taken some blood samples from Ripley's blood, where she died, and decided to clone her. The first seven times where a disaster, but on the eighth try, the clone came out absolutely perfect. Their plan was to clone her with a clone of the alien queen inside her, take out the alien, grow it and give it some sort of drug that will cause the Alien Queen to develop a human reproductive system. Instead of the Alien Queen laying eggs, where the face hugger inside implants the alien, the alien can mate with other Aliens, and reproduce naturally. RIPLEY (again played by Sigourney Weaver) is now a clone, who has been mixed with some of the Alien's DNA, giving her some of the creature's characteristics, as their acid burning blood, their speed, their sense of smell, everything. But Ripley has her own human characteristics, as well as her memories from the first three films. which is why she still remains a good character. Among Ripley's doctors are DR. MASON WREN (played by J.E. Freeman) and DR. JONATHAN GEDIMAN (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky), who are among the plot, involving the Alien Queen. Running the ship is GENERAL MARTIN PEREZ (played by Dan Hedaya).

  On their way to the ship holding Ripley, is a band of smugglers, containing bodies of people. These bodies are being used to make other Aliens aboard. The smugglers are known as VREISS (played by Dominique Pinon), CHRISTY (played by Gary Dourdan), JOHNAR (played by Ron Pearlman), HILLARD (played by Kim Flowers), CALL (played by Winona Ryder), and ELGYN (played by Michael Wincott). They have no idea of what these bodies are being used for.

  They arrive at the ship. Call goes to kill Ripley, thinking she still has the Alien inside of her. They talk briefly, and Call leaves. She is captured by the guards of the ship, where her and her crew are in trouble for Call. But the Aliens bust out of their cell and roam around, killing off most of the ship's guards, and General Perez. The only ones left are Ripley, Call, Johnar, Elgyn, Hillard, Wren, Christy, and Vreiss. Ripley joins them to help them escape. Along the way, after distrusting Ripley at first, Call becomes friends Ripley, and during that time, Elgyn, Hillard, and Christy are killed. Wren turns on them and shoots Call. But Call survives, for she is...an android. She helps them along the way, where Wren is killed. Ripley is captured by the Queen, where the Queen mates with Ripley. The queen gives birth to a baby, half alien-like, half human-like. Ripley escapes and enters the smuggler's ship. She begins helping them drive, as Call closes the hatch. Realizing how long she is taking, Ripley goes back to check. The alien baby has Call trapped. Ripley distracts the alien away from Call. She cuts her hand and throws her acid blood on the window, where it burns a hole right through it. The alien is ripped to shreds, where Ripley, Call, Vreiss, and Johnar return to earth, safely.

  I thought there was no need for a fourth installment, since it should have been left at Ripley's death in ALIEN 3. But this sequel was one hell of an improvement of ALIEN 3. Don't get me wrong, ALIEN 3 was a killer sequel, but it was depressing when we had to watch Ripley plummet to her death. ALIEN RESURRECTION saved us from our sadness.",1118102400,3,3881,4.707964601769912
936292,1,6304844948,"This is hands down the worst movie and biggest disappointment I have ever seen. I love the first three Alien movies (yes, I even appreciated the third one), but this movie left such a bad taste in my mouth I actually left the theater in search of a breath mint. Perhaps it just had too much to live up to?

The sad thing is I highly respect the director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, also known for `The City of Lost Children' and `Amelie' (two movies that I love). This movie was just soooooooo out-there for me, it was just too much. It was literally `The City of Lost Children' meets `Alien', which is not a good combination. Alien Resurrection was too artsy where the previous movies in the trilogy were anything but (well, the third one a little more than the other two). It lacked that realism that the previous films had. That realism was the driving momentum that the previous films flourished on, in which scared the audience...this one just didn't have that. The acting was bland, emotionless and I did not feel any connection to any of the characters. The plot was dull, slow and way too predictable. The visuals were mediocre and those even slacked towards the end. I found myself laughing several times by the time the movie ended. Come on now...the alien gets sucked out of a hole into space...talk about anticlimactic. *sigh* This movie was created to make money.

936293,5,6304844948,"This is one of those movies that should have been much better than it should have been. It featured a script from one of my favorite creative artists, Joss Whedon of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE and ANGEL fame, direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director of A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, AMELIE, and CITY OF LOST CHILDREN), and reprises the greatest female action hero in movie history: Ellen Ripley. Or at least her clone. In 1997 when this was released Whedon was not yet known for what he would achieve with BUFFY on television nor Jeunet for what he would do with AMELIE and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, but in retrospect the film on paper seems utterly ideal. First, you had the matching of Whedon with Ripley. More than any other recent American screen writer, Joss Whedon feels at home with strong female characters. He was, after all, the one who created in Buffy the supreme female action hero of our time (and set the stage for a host of imitators such as Max Guevera on DARK ANGEL and Sydney Bristow in ALIAS). Who better to write the screenplay for the fourth film in the ALIEN sequence? Unfortunately, although no other writers are credited, his script was extensively rewritten during production. Whedon has since disavowed his involvement with the film, and refused to be involved with the commentaries for the ALIEN boxed set.

One would have to agree with Whedon that the final outcome is not that great. One can often glimpse great potential in the film, but there is also a feeling that much of it was made on the fly, and that it is the victim of constant compromises. We know, for instance, that dozens of scenes had to be modified or altered for financial or other considerations. One also wonders to what extent Jeunet was the right person for the director's position. I have to confess to not being one of his fans. I loved AMELIE, but as I've seen his other films, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that while he possesses an extraordinary eye and can produce films that are wondrous to look at, he is seriously challenged by narrative. CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a haunting film to watch, but the story really isn't worth discussing. A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is one of the most incoherent major releases of the past couple of decades, despite being exquisitely beautiful in very nearly every frame. Even AMELIE succeeds more as something to look at than as a story to follow. This is not a good combo for a writer like Whedon who is obsessed with narrative. They do not play off one another's strengths. My own suspicion is that the final film is a result of the wrong director for the wrong set up financially-minded producers to produce a screenplay that didn't mesh with the strengths of either the director or the producers. But the brute fact is that the film was severely under-budgeted (it was made for between $50 and $60 million, which was not much even in 1996-97 for a major science-fiction film), and too many compromises had to be made, especially considering that much of the budget had to go for salary.

Nonetheless, there are still many memorable moments in the movie, and all in all I'm glad it was made rather than not made. I do wish a different director had been involved, someone who understood narrative and was good at exposition. But what we have is often interesting. Ripley is simply the best female movie action hero ever, and anytime we get to see Sigourney Weaver reprise the role is something to be grateful for (there have been rumors on and off over the past few years that we might see one more ALIEN film). In this film she is a clone, and a disturbed clone at that. She is simultaneously world-weary and psychotic. She's been stripped of the compassion that was found in the first films, the intense passion for life. Only gradually does she regain some of her humanity in the course of the film. I liked Winona Ryder's turn as the android Annalee Call (which creates an odd conflict in Ripley, who has a history with androids), and many of the other characters as well. The cast wasn't the problem with the film. The problem with the film is the sense that everything is being done on the cheap.

Many Whedonesque touches survive in the dialogue. Before getting the chance to do BUFFY on TV, Whedon worked extensively as a script doctor, his job being to add sparkle and one liners to otherwise moribund scripts. It isn't an accident that BUFFY has perhaps more great one liners of any show in the history of American TV. The guy can write a great line. So, ALIEN RESURRECTION has a host of great lines, many of them containing words that makes it impossible to repeat here. But you have to love an exchange like:

Johner: So, I hear you, like, ran into these things before?

Ripley: Yeah.

Johner: What did you do?

Ripley: I died.

Or when Ripley is talking to someone who has had one of the aliens implanted in his chest for gestation:

Purvis: WHAT'S [expletive deleted] INSIDE ME?

Ripley: There's a monster in your chest. These guys hijacked your ship, and they sold your cryotube to this... human, and he put an alien inside of you. It's a really nasty one. And in a few hours, it's gonna burst its way through your rib cage, and you're gonna die. Any questions?

Purvis: Who are you?

Ripley: I'm the monster's mother.

Or this great line:

Distephano: I thought you were dead!

Ripley: Yeah, I get that a lot.

There is a lot of great talk like this in the film. Unfortunately, the talk is a whole lot better than the sets and the action. Throughout there is a sense of lack, as if things are not quite finished, or not sufficiently developed. All in all, it is better than nothing, and I think over the next few decades I'll go back to this from time to time, but it is always going to be more of a could-have-been than anything else.

The previews to this film when it first came out did provide one of the great comic moments of my life. I was sitting in the theater with the woman I was dating at the time, an utterly brilliant and astonishingly cute anthropology Ph. D. student at the University of Chicago (today graduated and teaching in a Midwestern university). I was trying to explain to her who Dan Hedaya was, developing my theory that for many years there was a secret contract somewhere that determined that he had to appear in every other film made in Hollywood, and had mentioned several of his roles, none of which struck home. In exasperation I said, ""I swear, the guy is in everything!"" At which point the lights went down and the previews began, the first of which was for ALIEN RESURRECTION and which began with a shot of Dan Hedaya. I elbowed her and said, ""That's Dan Hedaya!"" ""Oh,"" she said, ""he's in everything!"" Just a perfect moment.",1109980800,7,6712,4.552238805970149

Alien: Resurrection has the playful dark fantasy touch that seems so antithetical to the grim reality that defines the first two movies but is what makes the films of Terry Gilliam and Jeunet so tasty.

The standard Alien and space special effects are in play here. The music has a tendency to get in the way of scenes instead of enhancing them. There's a nice mixed group of engaging characters in the smugglers (the lovers, the horny foul mouthed tough guy, the brainy soft hearted wheelchair bound guy, the calm leader, the one with a secret) and the obsessed to the point of arrogant blindness doctors. Over all, the idea of a hybrid Ripley/Alien is an interesting one and makes for a decent center to a good fun action film.

Chapter 1: Main Titles

This is the orginial, alternate opening of Alien Resurrection. This opening is also longer than the theatrical opening.

Chapter 3: Born Again

This extended scene shows Ripley trying to get away from the scientists when they remove the Alien Queen embryo.

Chapter 6: Memories

This extended scene shows Ripley having memeories about the girl in the picture a woman is showing her. It also shows added dialogue between Ripley and a scientist.

Chapter 7: The Betty

This extended scene has added dialogue between Elgyn and his co-pilot. It also shows Vriess joking around with Call.

Chapter 9: The Deal

This extended scene shows added dialogue between General Perez and Elgyn.

Chapter 21: ""He's got one inside of him.""

This scene has additional dialogue between Ripley and the crew.

Chapter 22: A Trap

This scene shows additional dialogue between Ripley and Call.

Chapter 24: Connecting at the Chapel

This extended scene has added dialogue between Ripley, Call, and everyone else about their ""disposable"" weapons before they make their plunge their weapons.

Chapter 31: ""I'm a stranger here myself.""

This is the alternate ending for Alien Resurrection, and it shows Ripley, Call, Vriess, and Johner landing on post-apyopaltic Earth.

936341,2,6304844948,"My title may seem slightly paradoxical in the wake of AVP and after Alien 3, but AVP doesn't count and Alien 3 was actually a decent, underrated film: Alien Ressurection is not.

First of all, this film should never have been made.  The Alien series was quite rightly a trilogy, not a tetrology or quadrilogy or whatever they're calling it.  The series was neatly wrapped up and there was no reason to bring it back, certainly not for this mess.  The strong protagonist from the first 3, Ellen Ripley, is not back.  Instead we have a cloned version fond of snippy, out-of place dialogue.  Instead of a strong supporting cast we have cariactures like ""The noble black man who heroically but rashly gives his life"" (however this character can be seen in Alien and Alien 3 as well, played by Yaphet Kotto and Charles S. Dutton, respectively), the muscle man Johnner (although I must be honest, he was clearly the most interesting and likeable character) and a thoroughly awful Winona Ryder, acting poorly in every scene requiring the slightest hint of emotion.

The characters who get the worst treatment are the aliens.  Originally a menacing jet-black insect-like creature that was not a creature to be trifled with, we now have these poorly-animated (although admittedly better than in Alien 3) boring animals that don't evoke any interest.  The new alien introduced in the latter half of the film is grotesque but little else.

There are a few positives: Ron Perlman's character Johnner is fun, the underwater sequence is handled quite well as long as you're able to beleive that all the characters could hold their breath for 2 minutes plus.  One scene features a character yelling another character's name in warning, at which point he looks up, knowing the end has come.  But when I'm naming individual scenes as a movie's high point, you know things aren't going well.

As far as the new edition versus the theatrical release, there's very little new material, and most of it inconsequential.  However, while the new title sequence is still a little disgusting, it's better than the ""mass of goo"" title sequence in the original

936342,4,6304844948,"I'm the biggest sucker for B rated films. The only part of the film I found emotionally disturbing was when the new and improved resurrected Ripley enters the room of horrors. A room full of failed experiments that eventually led to a success. That being, herself. I was really hoping, much like how the character Duncan Idaho in the Dune series, began to ""remember"" memories, that Ripley too would do the same. Perhaps in the sequel. When the spaceship crashed into the Earth, I was a bit surprised there was anything left. Not sure why they didn't just drop the ship into the Sun. Ripley's new blood, part human, part Alien, was quite interesting. I was also surprised how cunning and intelligent the Alien creatures were themselves. Killing one of their own in order to escape. With all the movie francises moving towards ""Blah vs Blah2"", I wouldn't mind seeing Alien vs The Borg. Alien blood would be interesting to deal with with synthetic implants. The next movie should feature the Alien homeworld, which would likely be absolutely ""alien"" to anything we know of. How did these buggers get on that ship in Alien the original anyways? These guys would be good to put up against the replicators in Stargate-SG1. We're sending out broadcasts into the void hoping the Vulcans will come and notice us.

""I can get you off, maybe not of the ship, but I can get you off.""

The bad, what I didn't like was the stupidity of the pirate captain who gets it early on, and the wussiness of Christie who gets a little acid on his face so commits suicide. Oh and aliens dodging bullets. That annoyed me a little.

The Ugly part was the stupid alien/human hybrid at the end, an extremyl violent tempermental babay looking for a mommy in ripley.

936365,3,6304844948,"Some people think that ""Alien 3"" is the worst movie in the series. Others think that ""Alien Resurrection"" is the worst. I think that ""Resurrection"" is slightly better than ""Alien 3"", but I also think that we all agree that both ""Resurrection"" and ""Alien 3"" aren't even close to the level of excellency of the first two movies.

 Anyway, ""Alien Resurrection"" does have interesting things: the atmosphere is dark and it's very stylish. Finally we can see a pretty face in the series, Winona Ryder plays a supporting role in this movie. Also, ""Resurrection"" has scenes packed with bullets, explosions and action.

 However, ""Alien Resurrection"" also has low points. Yes, Winona appears here, but her acting talent is kinda wasted. Some plot twists feel very forced, and the movie has its share of grotesque and pointless scenes. But all those things are OK, however, the thing that I can't forgive as a fan of the series is the humanoid Alien creature, that thing is so grotesque and infamous that the damn thing makes that the final scenes look like an ultra-cheap horror movie.

 In the final countdown ""Alien Resurrection"" still is good enough to score a solid 3 stars rating in my scale, but to be honest I would recommend you only the first two movies, ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"".",1091750400,,1276,4.80365296803653
936366,3,6304844948,"I'm inspired to write a review because the debate about the quality of the third and fourth Alien installments is quite rabid. My recommendation, first of all, is to watch Alien3 again. Better yet, get the new DVD and watch both versions. It seems that some people can't understand how an Alien movie could be so gloomy and pessimistic... which is really a bizarre opinion. IT IS AN ALIEN MOVIE, NOT 'EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.'
With that said, unlike many other folks who hold Fincher's film in high esteem, I don't hate Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection. The visuals are spectacular. The environments are very well done, very spooky. In my opinion, this is where Aliens, under action guru Jim Cameron, lacked. Though HR Giger was not involved with this project, Jeunet has an appreciation of his art, as demonstrated in the ""viper pit"" scene.
The performances are well executed, even Winona Ryder, whom I love to hate. Resurrection, though last on my list as far as the Alien movies, is not a bad film. It's certainly a step up from most of the movies out there today.
Now to the bad: I suspect that Gillis and Woodruff try too hard to make the Alien their own. Giger did not approve of the new look. The excess slime and the brown colour looks like ""s#$*"" (his words). It's basically on of Spielberg's Raptors, but with a phallic head.
Jeunet's odd sense of humour is out of place in an Alien movie, in my opinion. Then again, I say this as someone who loved the doom and gloom of Alien3.
While the idea of greedy corporates cloning Ripley for their own purposes does make for an interesting story, I suspect that it reflects how the greedy suits at Fox want to cash in on this series as much as possible! Though, thankfully, with somewhat artistically respectable results.
Best to worst in my view: Alien, Alien3, Aliens, Alien Resurrection. But the bottom of the barrel here is still better than most of what's playing right now.",1090281600,11,1938,4.669590643274854
936367,1,6304844948,"No stars for this film, it flat out suuuux. It was an embarrasment. No wonder talented screen writer Joss Whedon cried when he saw the finished film. Bad acting, bad costumes, bad set design, rediculous ending, bad CGI. Bad bad bad. The alternate opening and ending on the other version of the film provided here are even worse, a total joke. The  film makers should be ashamed of themselves. This film is a total embarrasment.",1085702400,5,427,4.693333333333333
936368,4,6304844948,"I already reviewed the original version of this film back in September (i.e., not perfect, but a decent sequel and enjoyable ""popcorn"" flick). So these comments here are specific to the ""new"" revised Collector's Edition, which was part of the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" version.
If you want to own this movie, definitely go for this new version. I was on the fence about this for a long while...did I really need to spend money AGAIN for a DVD? (And what's with that? How many times do greedy movie studios need to dive into our wallets?) Because I've been ripped off and bought ""new collector's"" or ""Special Edition"" versions of films that were frankly...not special.
This version of ""Alien Resurrection"" is a happy exception to that experience. This is an excellent set, affordably priced, beautifully and artistically packaged and most importantly, it has really significant and worthwhile additions that -- if you like this movie at all to begin with -- you will definitely want to own.
Although director Jeunet is very defensive about the idea that this is NOT a ""director's cut"" and he thought the movie was fine the way it was...after seeing the NEW extended version, I totally disagree! The restored footage -- about 10 minutes or so -- dramatically improves and clarifies the story and fills in some confusing details that were very vague in the original.
There is a greatly improved title sequence involving an insect loose in a space shuttle that is leaps and bounds better than the original titles (kind of a ""morphing"" sequence showing Ripley's failed clones). It is unfinished, so the little insect looks very much like a video game character, but the overall concept and direction is fresh, humorous and just plain better than the original.
There is more clarity and information about the minor characters, especially the pirate crew of ""The Betty"". Just the retention of a few lines, or brief shots, can make all the difference in a film...for example, in this version (as in the original Joss Whedon script) it is clear that crippled mechanic Vriess (Dominique Pinon) is in love with Call (Winona Ryder), a situation that was barely hinted at in the original film. Ditto for the sexy relationship between Captain Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and his pilot (Kim Flowers) -- barely acknowledged in the original film, here more time is spent showing that they are clearly longtime lovers...which in turn explains her great distress at his later death.
There is a scene that references Ripley's relationship with the late Newt (from Aliens 2), more time spent on Ripley's psychological state. And a lot more kinkiness in the relationship between Ripley and the alien creatures...it appears to be more graphic sexually at any rate.
Best, I think, is the revised ending that shows ""The Betty"" landing on earth...this is far more satisfying that just showing Ripley and Call in the window of the ship, merely saying ""Oh, look out there, we're on earth"". We actually see a run down future city (Paris, perhaps, in a nod to Jeunet?) and a planet whose ecosystem looks pretty drained. It's definitely cartharctic. Plus it more clearly sets up a potential sequel featuring aliens loose on earth. You know how one ALWAYS gets away...
BTW: I disagree with those viewers who feel that the Auriga ""crashes"" into the earth and causes the death of 10 million or so humans. I think it's clear that the Auriga blows up in the atmosphere. I figure that would be a problem in and of itself, but it's not the same as ""crash landing"". Neither does ""The Betty"" crash land...which is clearer in this new version, as we can see that the whole crew has survived without injury.
Surprisingly, this all makes for a superior movie and one I wish had been shown in the theatres in the first place...I think it would have overcome some of the fan displeasure that greeted the last two sequels in the series. It's not the original...it's not the excellent 2nd film...but it's a decent movie and it's better now. Watch it in this new version before you dismiss it out of hand.",1084838400,3,4046,4.83982683982684
936369,4,6304844948,"Alien Resurrection seems to have suffered unjustly at the hands of critics and fans. By no means as bad as Alien 3, this installment has many things to recommend it.
As noted in another user review, I think the reason that it was so badly recieved is that it did not take itself quite as seriously as the previous films and refused to reach the heights of pomposity and high-seriousness that 1, 2 and 3 seemed to insist upon. The combination of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Gallic irony and Joss 'Buffy' Whedon's one-liner laden script was perhaps just a too much for the die-hard anoraks out there.
Resurrection is not without its faults but it does hold up as a good popcorn movie with some impressive concepts behind it. Signourney Weaver's reinvention of Ripley is nicely done, making her intriguing and menacing all at once. I'd love to see more of this new, improved Ripley sometime. Perhaps the weakpoint is Winona Ryder as Call. We never really seem to care for her underdeveloped character and the relationship between her and Ripley (which should be a key one) never really seems to gel.
The Alien itself is much more impressive in this film, compared to the anaemic, dog-Alien for 3 and this film does pack a lot in the way of genuine chills and spills.
The main reasons this perfectly fine sf horror movie did not receive the recognition it deserved can, I think, be summarised as follows:
1. It was perhaps too cerebral and thoughtful a film after the travesty of 3. The franchise perhaps was more in need of a Aliens-style high-octane romp to fully revive the interest of fans and critics.
2. The slightly playful and ironic approach of the script and direction perhaps alienated (sic) the franchise's hardcore following.
3. Too much momentum was lost after the dismal third installment. Ideally, Resurrection should have been followed almost immediately by another film, one with perhaps more of an action bent to it.
All in all, I would rate this film highly as it combines intellligent and intriguing sf with genuine horror chills and a nice undercurrent of irony and detachment.",1083456000,2,2088,4.802777777777778
936370,4,6304844948,"Alien 4 has garnered some rotten reviews. Unfairly so.  I suspect that one of the reasons why many people dismiss this film is that it simply doesn't take itself as seriously as either the brilliant but rather po-faced Aliens 2 and the atmospheric and even more po-faced Aliens 3. There's more comedy, more snappy one-liners and a cinematic dexterity that seems to come so easily to French filmmakers such as Marc Caro, Luc Besson, Jean-Jacques Beneix to name a few. This was perhaps what made people turn their noses up at Fifth Element; they were peeved that Besson had not quite been reverential and serious enough.
And indeed at times the tone in Aliens-the Resurrection veers towards light-heartedness (even flippancy), but there's also breathtaking action scenes, stunning photography and a climax that kicks bottom, although not perhaps on the scale of the James Cameron masterpiece. The aliens are there, present and correct (they're back and this time they're really upset!)and there are loads of genetic experiments-gone-wrong to make you go: ""OOOh! Urrgh! Look at That one!"". The film's main weakness is some of the acting performances. Some of the thespians were perhaps chosen more on the strengths of their looks rather than acting ability, but for every Winona Ryder there's a J.E.Freeman who is once again typecast as the Dickensian bad guy, but does it brilliantly as usual. Sigourney is looking a wee bit tired (I don't think she'll be back for the fifth) but does the Ripley thing with the required - if uninspired - gutsiness. To sum up, Aliens 4 doesn't quite reach the heights of Aliens 2 - what can? - but is nevertheless miles better than Aliens 3. (Someone should talk to Paul Veerhoven about doing no. 5.) Good fun.

This is the first Alien flick I've seen that didn't scare me. I had seen ""Aliens"" first and even though it was more of an action movie, it was still scary. Then I saw ""Alien 3"" when I was 10; I came out of the theater trembling, maybe the theater was cold. Soon after that, I saw the first film ""Alien"" and realized old movies can be scary, too.

Then I saw ""Resurrection"" and all I did was laugh. ""Resurrection"" is ok, but it just isn't what i would call an alien film. Three stars because it made me laugh.",1078444800,3,636,4.0
936373,3,6304844948,"Easily the weakest of the ""Alien"" films, this fourth entry seemed like a quick way to earn a few more dollars off a franchise that had already been put to rest. I have never been a big fan of ""Resurrection"" but it wouldn't have made sense not to release it with the other three films when the time came for the ""Alien Quadrilogy"". Like the other films, you get two versions- the original theatrical release and a brand-new special edition.
""Resurrection"" never quite added up to me. They had more or less ended the series succesfully with ""Alien 3"" but for some reason, they decided they needed to bring Ripley back once again. This time, she has been cloned by a team of government scientists and military personel to bring life back to the species that she wiped out in the last movie. For added plot, a team of ""space pirates"" sell the human crew of a ship that they seized to the scientists so that they can use them as bait. The Aliens end up getting loose and killing anyone in their path as the humans try to escape. It's all been done before though and much better too.
Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and writer Joss Whedon try their hardest but this sequel just isn't necessary at all. The two most sypmathetic characters in the film are emotionless creatures and the remaining ones are either too macho or too cowardly to be even the slightest bit likeable. Jeunet's attempt to give the film a feel similiar to his European work just doesn't play right as part of the series. Where the first film was scary, the second was thrilling, and the third was bleak, this one is just weird. We have all these deformed Ripley clones in a lab, a bunch of really strange characters, and an anti-climatic moment in which Ripley makes love with her Alien child. What? ""Resurrection"" does provide one real cool scene in which the human survivors are being chased by the Aliens underwater but after that, it just goes back to being strange for the sake of being strange.
The longer special edition version has a couple of extended sequences as well as an alternate opening and ending for the film. As director Jeunet points out in his intro to it, this is not a ""director's cut"" as he was content with the original cut of the film. It's just a longer and somewhat different version of the same movie. Nothing put back in really saves it from being a disaster though there is one scene where the Ripley clone attempts unsuccesfully to remember Newt from ""Aliens"" that is somewhat neat for series fans. The featurettes on the second disc go into extensive detail about the making of the film but since I really didn't care for the movie, they weren't that insightful to me with the exception of the concluding one where people involved with the franchise discuss what a fifth film might be like.
If you enjoyed ""Resurrection"" then this is actually a really good special edition. The DVD itself is packed with so much added bonus features that you will probably enjoy but as a die-hard ""Alien"" fan, I never liked this fourth movie. Thumbs down to the film, thumbs up to the DVD.",1078099200,4,3067,4.557971014492754
936374,3,6304844948,"This movie could have been great - it had the budget and the talent, but somehow it came together as a thrill-ride for 14-year-olds..  If you let Joss Wheland of Buffy fame write a real sci-fi movie for adults... then the project fails.  He's a brilliant lightweight.  This film proves it.
Flaws include:
1) A happy ending for most flicks does not include crashing a giant spaceship into South America. It's a sour note to kill 10M people on the ground. Really.
2) Most of the characters here are all moving cardboard cutouts. They have no backstory or context outside the movie.  Without more personity, no matter how good it is, it's still not very good.. E.G. Tomb Raider.. There's just no life behind the eyes of these people and no deep dialogue.
3) There's basically too much physical plot going on.  Too much running around - through the ship & back again with no setup & no context.  There's little planning.  There's a lot of running & shooting.  Less would have been more here, and being disoriented and lost in the ship-laberynthe added nothing.
The aliens themselves have (amazingly) become commonplace and hum-drum. Sure they're dangerous but they're not smart and they've run out of surprises. Instead of oozing slime with great menace they've become walking geysers of slippery goo. Scary!
I have to say though, the child-hybrid monster was very disturbing.  It was un-nerving to look at in the way that the original alien was 25 years ago.  Maybe it can have it's own series on the WB.
On a sad note, to have spent that much $ without a big box office return means the franchise has probably run out of steam.  C'est la vie.  It was fun, but without Jim Cameron working on it it's time has past.",1077667200,9,1711,4.629139072847682

And by some genetic miracle the queen inside of her was cloned as well, yeah that makes perfect sense.  But...but...they couldn't totally separate the queen and Ripley DNA.  Woah, so now we have TWO mutant clones.  Surely madness will ensue from this.  I as well as many people didn't really like the amount of sci-fi in this movie, really breaking down the alien and seeing every single part of it lit perfectly.  Then naturally, the alien drones are super-intelligent and naturally escape from their captivity and proceed to take over the whole ship.  Oh yeah, and Winona Ryder is some really pissy negative android who hates herself.  And a lot of really irritating characters are the crew that brought over the humans for the eggs laid by the queen to impregnate.  As I said, much goes wrong.  One thing I've noticed about all the Alien movies is the token black guy.  Sometimes there's more than one, but the black guy never lives to see the end.  Anyway, what is there to like about this movie?  I really don't know, you get to see really bad digital effects(by anyone's standards), really REALLY cliched characters badly acted, Sigourney Weaver mating with an alien, the queen giving birth to Ripley's love-child hideous white thing that...just...wow), Ripley having to kill said love-child really really gruesomely, and the tease for ""Alien 5.""

936408,4,6304844948,"Not unlike ""Alien 3,"" when I went and watched ""Alien Resurrection"" in the theater my initial impression of the movie wasn't any different than my initial impression of ""Alien 3;"" what were they thinking.  As a whole, the critics and the fans pretty much panned ""Alien Resurrection.""  Since that time, I'd never even considered purchasing ""Alien 3"" or ""Alien Resurrection,"" in essence discounting them from the series.  Given this recent release of all four movies on DVD with Director's and Special Edition cuts and a rekindled interest in giving these movies one more chance I decided to purchase them and I would have to say that after watching both of them again I'm happy I gave them a second chance.
I think what pretty much blew it for both ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection"" was that they were both seemingly complete departures from the first two exceptional movies and that the direction these movies took just turned the fans off of them.  With ""Alien Resurrection"" I would still say that it is probably the worst of the four movies but it still, in my opinion, garners four stars for its originality and the way in which they brought Ripley back.
Overall, the script is extremely creative and for the better part of the movie, the suspense/action factors are there; where this movie falls somewhat flat on its face is the ending and the extraordinarily odd turn for the alien queen.  Contrary to that fall off in the conclusion, the scene with everybody trying to escape through a flooded kitchen has to be one of the best action sequences I've ever seen in a film!
For her part, Sigourney Weaver does an exceptional job of reinventing Ripley for this script.  The cast of supporting actors is pretty impressive as well, from Winona Ryder to Ron Perlman, this movie has the talent that, for the better part, overcomes the ending of the movie.
This is the only movie that Jean-Pierre Jeunet has directed and I would have to say that this French director did a great job with the overall setup and feel of the movie.  Again, it's just the ending that disappoints and whether he as the director had much influence as far as that's concerned, I kind of doubt it.  The score for the film matches every scene quite deftly, greatly enhancing the overall feel of the movie.
The Premise:
It is over two hundred years since the events of ""Alien 3"" in which Ripley sacrificed herself in opposition of allowing the alien queen growing in her chest making it into the hands of the ""Company.""  Although it's not clearly defined within the movie, the military organization that seems to run everything now has procured a DNA sample of Ripley's and cloned her, alien queen included.
This military organization has cloned Ripley and her ""baby"" so that they could do everything that Ripley tried to prevent the ""company"" from doing in her time.  Along with an alien queen being cloned, the general leading the operation has hired the crew of the Betty, which is an unregistered crew of space pirates, to procure for him people who were in hyper sleep so that he can use them to create more aliens...
What follows from there is a good movie where Ripley, the space pirate crew and some of the remaining military personnel go through the motions of trying to stay alive long enough to get off the ship that is now full of aliens who are on the loose.
I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the series, despite the abominable ending of the movie.  {ssintrepid}

936409,3,6304844948,"It's tough to raise people from the dead. To paraphrase Robin Williams from Aladdin, it's creepy and no one likes to do it. Except in science fiction and horror movies. The fourth film in the series takes a cheeky attitude, a dark sense of humor and runs with it. In Alien Resurrection everyone is dysfunctional and humanity has become the worst of the lot.
The company is gone. It's now replaced with a mysterious arm of the military that is doing the research necessary to bring back the Alien. The downside is that they also bring back Ripley. She's considered nothing more than a ""meat byproduct"" by some of the command staff. Evidently, their DNA became mingled during the process so there's a bit of Alien in Ripley. She's a very different creature from the original model. The Aliens evidently have racial memory and one of the advantages of this is that Ripley remembers much of what happened to her and her former life.
A spaceship arrives with unwilling volunteers to help continue the Alien species. These black market traders are only in it for the money until they become potential prey as well.
Like most of the stuff written by Joss Whedon, you'll either love the film or hate it. Many of the human characters are repulsive while the nonhuman display more humanity and compassion. The special edition included opens with an unfinished CGI sequence that would have set the tone for the film even better and, yes, clued in the audience not to expect Alien, Aliens or Alien 3. Like the previous films, Alien Resurrection is a unique vision. The dark humor that runs at the heart of this film will turn folks off who expect Scott's horror film, Cameron's Terminator in space or Fincher's dark, nililistic view of the prison planet.
The film does suffer from a number of flaws. Some of the roles are miscast and sometimes the humor is at the expense of good storytelling but, on the whole. Alien Resurrection has a number of things to recommend it.
I found the additions improved both the characterizations and the action for the most part. The original ending was far superior to the shorter version that appeared in the theatrical cut. While the differences here between the theatrical version and special edition aren't as dramatic as Aliens, the lost characters moments and bits of dialogue do make the characters a bit closer to you and I in their humanity.
Love them or hate them, all the sequels to Alien are unique stylistically and thematically. The directors and writers working on them tried to always come up with something different. They weren't always successful at making a great movie but each one is different enough to make them all very interesting and quite enjoyable on their own.",1073865600,,2712,4.772340425531915

It is a great movie, though some people may say not. Most critics rated this pretty poorly, for no reason. You may think this movie will be bad because it may seem like an attempt to revive the series and it is, but it's a good one. With a perfect mix of well choreographed action and black comedy Alien: Resurrection is a definate buy. The only downside is that those weirdoes who think Aliens, not Alien3, was the best in the series will probably not like it because there's no cute and cuddly marines in it.

Alien Resurrection was just meant to be a fun action movie. If you want something as high class as Cameron's Aliens, get ready for Alien 5.

The worst aspect, though, would have to be the characterization.  Unlike the first three movies, in which the interplay of the characters supplemented their struggle against the aliens, the characters in Resurrection are two-dimensional, crude, and wholly unlikeable.  I wanted all of them to die; everything about them is underdeveloped and unsophisticated.
If you're feeling self-sadistic, you should watch this film together with Jason X and then down a bottle of aspirin.",1069372800,3,664,5.427184466019417
936446,5,6304844948,"This was a good movie -- but the writers missed a great opportunity to present science fiction with a way-things-ought-to-be theme.  Life as it SHOULD and OUGHT to be.
These alien creatures attack and begin killing members of the crew on a space ship, along with some guests in transit and Officer Ripley.  Ripley takes charge, and leads everyone in the effort to simply kill these creatures.  In the end Ripley and her gang of cowboys prevailed, and all the creatures were dead.
The writers overlooked an excellent chance to demonstrate how life SHOULD be.  When Ripley and her compatriots were first attacked, they should have asked themselves, ""Why do these creatures hate us?""  And then they should have spent a significant amount of time examining their own behavior, to determine what faults or misdeeds of theirs had provoked the creatures to attack and kill them.  Next, Ripley and her bunch should have sought to form a coalition of some sort, dealing with a space equivalent of the United Nations, to pass resolutions against the creatures' violent behavior -- not against the creatures themselves, mind you, but only condemning their behavior.  Then, they should have sent inspectors to the creatures, to monitor compliance with the resolutions.  If the creatures had continued killing then, by golly, they could have given those inspectors more time.
THAT is how this story should have played out -- with the creatures living according to their own cultural/religious rules, and everyone else having to accommodate the fact that the creatures simply are going to kill/terrorize people from time to time.  That is the creatures' culture, and it was up to the others to understand, appreciate and accept that culture.  The sad fact is, Ripley and her people did not make enough of an effort to appease these creatures.  They showed absolutely NO signs of tolerance, diversity, inclusion or compassion.  Well, that's not wholly true.  That character portrayed by Brad Dorff was extremely compassionate in his last scene toward the end of the movie, praising the creature as ""beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"" just before the thing bit off his head.",1067299200,,2156,5.090909090909091
936447,3,6304844948,"The accelerating level of greed of the Fox studios can be measured by the number of years between Aliens installments - 7 years between the first two, 6 years between the second and third, and 5 years between the third and this final (?) installments.  But I digress . . .
As with the second installment, this one has an action movie feel and a tinge of humor that you would expect from a French director.  The plot starts out as believable as any of the other films - the ""Company"" has taken a sample of the deceased Ripley's blood to genetically engineer a clone - Ripley + new alien queen.  From the opening credits and a later sequence, it takes the Company many, many tries - but eventually they accomplish their goal.  However, as it turns out, the new ""Ripley"" is 99% human/1% alien, and the new alien queen is 99% alien/1% human.  As with all the installments, there is a great ensemble cast - including Winona Rider as a rogue android, playing upon Ripley's hate/love relationship with androids from the first two films.  However, ultimately the film takes a plot turn that is all too frequent in sequels where there is a lack of creativity - too many bad guys (e.g.,'Batman & Robin' (a/k/a 'Batman On Ice').  Namely, the abrupt birth of the human-alien hybrid in the last quarter of the film comes across as quite contrived (both in terms of special effects and plot) and ultimately betrays the film, and for that matter, the franchise.
The producers could have used the genetic engineering topic to create a much more subtle, but effective, ending involving Ripley's character and divided loyalties, but they missed the opportunity.  For that matter, they could have let the original director of 'Alien 3' make the movie he wanted to make (i.e., something not done in either of the first two installments - aliens on Earth), as the first two directors were permitted to do.  In any case, 'Alien Resurrection' is nothing more than an average action/sci-fi flick.",1066608000,,1972,4.709302325581396
936448,2,6304844948,"Alien Resurrection is the latest of the Alien sequels.  The film was intended to resurrect not only the character of Ripley but also the series, which took a major bashing with Aliens 3.  Aliens 3 was a total let down, a true bomb that left us unsatisfied at best.  Especially for those of us who love the first two.  Now, there's Alien Resurrection, and it turned the Alien series from something of a let down to a complete joke.
Let's see, where should I begin?  Let me start with bashing Ripley's character.  In a way, I can't blame the director of this film for wanting her character brought back, since she IS the Alien series to begin with.  And Aliens 3 ruined it by haivng  her chararacter die in the end, making another sequel with Ripley practically impossible.  But leave it to sleezy hollywood to turn the impossible possibe, even when they should leave it be.  Ripley comes back, cloned, only she's half Alien.  So her blood is acid.  Excuse me, how does a species that originates from another planet intersect, from a genetic point of view, with a human being?  Answer: it can't, but this is sleezy hollywood.
Let's talk about the other characters.  In short they are a bunch of buffoons.  Space mercs or pirates (I don't really remember because this film never had my attention) that find themselves on a military ship with genetically altered Ripley and her children, which turn out to be her anvil-headed, slimey buddies: the aliens.  Irony?  No, just another typical cheezy hollywood horror movie follow up sequel.  So these other characters, who serve no real point other than future victims, try to escape from this ship that starts to crawl with aliens.
All these characters, none of them, do we really give a hoot for.  Ripley included.  We don't like them, they are annoying half the time, or they have no depth.  Winona Ryder is the stupidest of characters because she does little to contribute and just gets in the way most of the time.  Her character does not intrigue me, it's boring, and her lines are lame.  While Ripley has hardly any emotions, is super strong, and just makes a bunch of one liners.  This isn't the Ripley we know and love, this is somebody or something else occupying Ripley's body and therefore we don't recognize Ripley in this clone.  And Ripley, as stated earlier, is the series.
There is little to no suspense.  Most of what one could consider suspense is so predictable, you know what's going to happen prior to it happening.  Such as the alien coming up from the floor or having them escape at that is so easily detectable by anyone who has seen enough horror films or at least seen the other three in the series.  This film does not scare me, the plot does not intrigue me, my attention span will span else where.  This is a horrid film that attracts people to it just simply because it is part of the Alien series, which was made by the first two films.
Not to mention a pathetic ending with Ripley and one of her mutant offspring.  By far the corniest part of this entire film was the end.  The sign of a terrible movie is a pathetic twist in the end and the attempt to create sympathy towards a character we never felt anything from.  We don't sympathize with Ripley like we did when she was stranded with a bunch of marines in a bunker in Aliens.  Or when she's the only one coming to her senses as her entire crew gets wiped out in Alien.  In Resurrection, we simply don't give a hoot about anybody in that film because no character development is attempted.  So without good characters, a film such as this hoped to survive by either wowing us with special effects or corny twists, neither of which wowed me.
If you are or were hoping for another good Alien(s) movie, you'll go wrong if you think this one is it.  This movie is the joke of the entire Alien Series.  It has no suspense, no character development, and a pathetic plot that hoped to wow you with corny twists.  Alien Resurrection fails to resurrect the series.  They should've left it alone.
Grade: C-",1066348800,2,4026,4.53120665742025
936449,4,6304844948,"No, it can't possibly live up to the first film which is a horror classic (more so than a sci fi film) and which re-set the look of most of the sci-fi movies for the following 20 years...changing the whole ""2001-Space Oydessy"" look of bright white/high tech to grubby and industrial. And it's not the stylish James Cameron thriller that the second film was. (Or the huge downer of the third film...let's just mutually forget that one.)
But try as I did to sneer, I had a good time watching this in the theater back in '97, and have seen it a couple of times on the tube since. I always get caught up in the action and the perennial appeal of the Ripley character and find I am having fun and two hours disappear.
Sigourney Weaver is just astonishingly good in this where you might expect her to have just phoned in an appearance. She looks amazing for how long has passed since the first film (18 years), and in this alien-hybrid form is seductive and threatening at the same time. You just can't take your eyes off of her!
Unfortunately, the filmakers didn't quite digest this, so they dragged in tiny cute Winona Ryder as the obligatory android-who-more-human-than-the-humans. Winona just doesn't look or feel right for this kind of adventure/action film and she slows things down. She isn't a good foil for Ripley, and her doll-like features and heavy eye-make up seem odd in a sci-fi universe where everything is so relentless gritty.
Much of the fun and good lines come from a grubby band of space smugglers (Michael Wincott {The Crow}, Gary Dourdan {CSI}, Ron Perelman {Beauty&Beast}, etc.) who bring a cargo load of cryo-sleeping  tourists onboard to become alien snack food. This is a nice change from all the typical military stuff, but by the time we get a handle on who's-who amongst the crew of the pirate ship, they are quickly being gobbled up by the aliens themselves. So not much character development goes on.
Some jibes I can't resist....
1. The big medical ship where the action takes place is said to be in ""unregulated space"" at the beginning of the film. Then, when the aliens escape and the ship set to blow up, we are told it will crash into earth in THREE HOURS. 250 years in the future and we have only explored space in less than a three hour radius around earth? Also, when we see the CGI shots of the space crafts, they are apparently orbiting a planet with moons that looks much like Jupiter.
2. How can a clone retain detailed memories of the organism it was cloned from? How can a clone retain a PARASITE from the organism it was cloned from? Wouldn't this be like cloning someone and having them appear wearing the clothes they were in when they were cloned? This really doesn't make a lick of sense.
3. Why is the Auriga medical research lab so vast...and the Betty freighter so tiny (appearing to be about the size of our current space shuttles) that it can easily fit inside? Isn't that illogical? Wouldn't a space freighter have to be really big to economically haul things around the solar system? And a medical lab could fit into an ordinary office building?
4. Why IS everything so grubby? Don't they have soap or Formula 409? Why are all the hairdoes, clothing, music, TV, video games etc. the same as what we would find today? (The filmakers are not having one iota of fun here inventing anything futuristic, even though the action takes place more than 250 years in the future.) There is an amusing bit where some of the space smugglers are watching the home shopping network, but nothing satirical is implied here and it goes nowhere (except what great reception they get !).
Alright, I'll stop now. Despite this, and the feeling that you have seen everything from the monsters, the sets, etc. before...this is movie still has fun and a few good scares in it and a very enjoyable reprise by Signourney Weaver.

My only, small, complain is that after 200 years the technology hasn't progressed at all (perhaps, like Star Trek, human civilization has reached a state of high but static technological development). I believe that there is still life for a sequel to this series. In all four movies no explanation or reference of any kind was given regarding the alien ship and it's origin from where the eggs were found.

Her Ellen Ripley (cloned this time) is strong yet sympathetic (the latter quality shown in her feelings for her cloned ""sisters"" and her own alien ""offspring"").  Joss Whedon's script allows Weaver and Ron Perlman to exchange some interesting banter and sling zingers to other cast members as well.

Now I know how Joss got the idea to resurrect Buffy in the dark season six episodes.  Ellen Ripley had been been cloned with the alien queen still inside of her, so they took out the clone and killed it.  Which is probably the most disturbing thing I have seen.  For a sec there, I thought the baby bastard was going to attack the scientists or something.  But no such luck.  Well, the special effect aliens were great.  Nuff said.

A later hybrid creature is just stupid looking -- basically a big skeleton with sad, puppy dog eyes.
The best reason to watch this movie is Weaver, who does marvels with her role. She brings a distinctly feral attitude to the character, and the light in her eyes and the grin on her face can be downright unnerving at times.
As for Winona Ryder -- let's face it. Shoplifter, sure. Space pirate and terrorist? Not a chance. From beginning to end, she remains unconvincing. The rest of the cast are two-dimensional at best.

Aliens was clearly the peak of this franchise.  While I enjoyed Alien, and found it's impact more profound, it was hard to beat the fun+message of James Cameron's version.
Alien 3 was disappointing for what might have been.  You just can't take Sigourney Weaver, a ""Future Corporation is Very Bad"" theme, and a bunch of scary monsters and stir them up in a prison without at least trying to make some sort of point.  Alien 3 was about nothing.
I was entirely hopeful that Alien Resurrection would at least advance the series in a logical direction; 1) Alien/Human interaction in Exploration, 2) Alien/Human interaction in Human Colony, 3) Alien/Human interaction in Human Homeworld - something like the reverse of the Smallpox virus in the Americas.  Alas - it was not to be.
Admittedly, I fell asleep several times during the viewing of this atrocity.  And yet I found that I had missed virtually none of the plot: Bunch of miscreants running around a futuristic set with lots of monsters.

936493,4,6304844948,"First, I have to explain why Alien Resurrection is actually a very good movie, with a very well-written script that was unfairly thrashed by the director as much as by critics. Then I will lay to rest some of the perceived scientific ""errors"" that people see in this movie.

Let's get one thing straight. There's a difference between a GOOD movie and a WELL-DONE movie. Good movies are defined by having well-written scripts, well-plotted stories, and emotionally driven scenes and themes. Alien Resurrection has all of these. The script is a shining example of Joss Whedon's infinite brilliance, both comedically and dramatically. We are never allowed to forget that Ripley is going through some serious personal issues regarding her identity, her allegiance, and her former life. The problem with this movie is that it is not well-done. The director took the script, cut out the best parts, wiped his butt with whatever was left, and put the result on film. The Aliens look like giant computer-generated turds, the Alien eggs look like turds, the Alien nest looks like a huge bowl of turds, the walls everywhere else look like someone smeared turds all over them, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet simply doesn't understand the concept of ""restraint,"" as we are repeatedly given ""too much g0dd@mn information."" I mean, the guy insisted that the Hybrid alien have -visible external genitalia- for God's sake. He could learn a lot from David Fincher, the director of Alien 3, who clearly knew when to hold back (Newt's autopsy) and when to paint the walls red (deaths of random characters that we don't give a crap about). Anyway, the bottom line is that this is a very good movie wrapped in an unpleasant package.

Now, for the technical stuff. The science here is not as impossible as some of the other reviewers would have you believe. First of all, particularly intense memories, such as those of the first three Alien movies, can be stored by the human brain in RNA form. These can later be incorporated into your actual genome, which is why there's the ""falling through space"" dream (which I've never experienced) and the ""running in slow motion"" dream (which I have). This explains why Ripley would remember parts of her past life. Second, I do not believe that the alien queen was the result of the cloning process; they never actually say that it is, and it seems much more logical that they would implant a new bugger. Come on, do you really think that after 200 years, they'd be unable to find another planet with aliens on it? That would explain why the aliens of this movie look different from those of the previous movies. Third, there are metals that resist acid, so the surgery is hardly impossible...

Overall, the complaints against this movie are extremely minor, and it is sad that so many people cannot see how great it is.",1049068800,3,2833,4.813141683778234
936494,4,6304844948,"In the depths of space, mankind is oftentimes found probing oddities they don't understand and doing what man does best; playing the role of deity and thinking that this will never cause any sort of problem for them in the longrun. Its also been a longstanding idea in the Alien series, showing mankind's ignorance when thinking in terms of discovery and destructive power. This once again is flaunted here, leading to a military project that has decidedly unadvised intentions, namely using the Xeno as a piece of weaponry. In order to acomplish this a scientific team takes a little taste of Ripley remains left behind of a certain prison planet, pull out a little genetic sampling from those droplets of blood that weren't baked away in the inferno-conclusion to the 3rd piece, and then start cloning her and the Queen Xeno cargo her belly was carrying. All this goes pretty well, constructing a genetic breed of human looking Ripley (with alien features) and a Queen that was kicking it in her belly, and the testing truly begins. Enter a band of space ""pirates"" out to make a few dollars with some cargo that the station needs, the breathing kind that can carry a little packet of love in its stomach, and you have a problem that, doubtlessly, gets out of hand.
In many rights, Aliens Resurrection did so many things in a wondrous way and yet, with the touch of a little storyline blundering and the genetic misfit it decides to parade around at the end, managed to fail. Its a sad thing, too, because the front half of the movie, except for the fact that we once again are bound to the hip of Ripley, is really good. The experimentation with the Alien shows that it is smarter than humans give it credit it for, as is shown in their ability in former movies to cut the lights to buildings, and even shows a somewhat mean streak in their ways of playing. When everything goes from bad to worse, the aliens swarming looks great with their glistening Xeno skins and their ability to maim, and the panic ensuing becomes something of a grandiose nightmare. This ends, however, when the Ripley factor of the movie becomes a stumbling block because, well, she's kind of dead, and the alien experiment comes to a somewhat bumbling head.
For someone with an open mind and that can stomach a good movie with a questionable ending, then this is something that you might want to look into. It isn't really the best of the Alien creations, though, and isn't one that I like to hold up high as a movie for everyone. Even fans of the Xeno, knowing the wondrous plots laid aside in Dark Horse presentations, understand that the experimental route could have gone in a better direction. That said, there are still Aliens herein and there is still dying, and the Xenos get a little of the respect they deserve in an interestingly horrific underwater scene and in the experimental phases they go through. So, watchers be warned that this is a mixed bag of events.",1047772800,12,2950,4.6316793893129775

936547,1,6304844948,"Ya know, it's almost like the writers from the Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street got together to make an unnecessary 4th installment to a perfectly good trilogy. I'm not even sure why I went to see this movie, other than I had been a fan for so long. ... Ripley died rather horribly, and anyone who sees someone fall into a pit of molten lava (or lead if you like) while an alien bursts out of that same persons chest, it stands to reason they've been well and thoroughly killed. But through the amazing, and poorly portrayed, miracle of cloning (not to mention financial backing from the Hollywood garbage factory) Ripley has returned. Ah science, what can't it do in the hands of poor writing? But she's a lot more animal like in her behavior, and doesn't play well with others. Enter a team of morons whose only real purpose in the film is to run away screaming from the aliens who kill them in increasingly elaborate ways, which ultimately begs the viewer to ask themselves this question: How long has this been on? Ah, but a story is not complete without a plot twist or two, and they add so much dimension to a story; or so I used to think. Winona Ryder is an Android, and so those big wet eyes are in fact the work of an engineer .... She's an Android with feelings though, and in an attempt at character development, akin to a child writing Shakespeare with a broken crayon, She must overcome her debilitating alienation (no pun intended) from her crew of moron/alien chew toys. The crowning achievement is the cross breeding of an alien with a human, once again provided through the miracle of scientific ignorance. Strangely enough, this new uber-alien enjoys all the benefits, and none of the weaknesses of human or alien. ...By the end you'll want those 90 or so minutes of your life back, but Movie Theaters don't give refunds.
  This movie is terrible. It has no redeeming qualities what so ever, and ruins whatever value the other 3 movies might have. Avoid at all costs.",1035244800,4,1997,4.544444444444444
936548,1,6304844948,"To say this is a good or bad movie depends on the criteria on which you judge it. As a brainless action/horror move, it works. As a sequel to a legendary series, it is one of the biggest disappointments in film history.
I got the whole Alien series in one set even though I really only wanted the first two. Hey it was cheaper. And I was surprised that when I watched the third film how much more I liked it. So I was feeling brave and watched Resurrection. You see I had seen it in the theater and almost walked out I was so disgusted. In those two hours I could have been doing something more fun, like carving bars of soap in to little funny shapes. ... Seeing it again reminded me of what I was missing. A lot of nothing and a lot of soap carving.
This movie has all the ingredients but has forgotten the recipe. A sequel should improve on or at least be as good as the movie(s) that have come before it. This is not easy and rarely ever happens. But that does not stop filmmakers from trying. There is a good cast, good enough effects, and lots of money involved. But what the 4th film does not have is a decent story. There is no character depth or development, no reason to care if they live or die. And if I don't care about what is going on, than why bother seeing it? The plot is equally thin. So they cloned Ripley for the alien. Most people with any sense would think that messing with things that bleed acid and bite off heads is a bad idea. And why would her DNA have anything to do with the alien's? They are two separate species after all. The answer is; because they want to make a quick box office buck. Or what about her memory? Why would a clone remember anything? That could have been an interesting subplot to the film. If I pay to see a movie, I expect it not to insult my intelligence. The rest of the movie is so lacking in sense that it's practically brain dead. Anyone who stayed awake in science class could see the logical holes in this movie...
Okay so ignore the flat characters, non-existent story and moronic plot. ...what does it offer? I wish I could say there was a single point where I was surprised or startled. If it looks like they should not go in there, than they will probably get attacked. Sure enough that is what happens. Surprise, surprise. The effects are a mixed bag; the CGI stuff looks good except it looks like CGI and the alien puppets look good except they look like puppets. There really is nothing here that we have not already seen in better films. The action is not as fast and furious as Aliens, nor is there any suspense or mystery like Alien. And the series did not end gracefully like in Alien3. I was not impressed with the acting. Most everyone dies, so they never really need to portray an interesting character. Weaver could have practically phoned in her lines. Granted they mutated Ripley, but it's a tired last-ditch effort for a character that we already knew everything about almost ten years ago. The other equally capable actors are given little to work with. That's a shame since there is some real talent in this film. At least the filmmakers did sort of try to give us a few new things. But did we really want to see a Queen pregnant? Was any of the silly stuff with the ""Newborn"" needed? ... More like a zombie than a phoenix, it has come back to remind us how much better the first two films are.
Someone once said; ""They do not make B movies anymore, they just give them multimillion dollar budgets and call them A movies"". This is not far from the truth. By now we understand the alien concept, we know how it works, the formula is used up. The only thing left to show are people getting their heads bit off. And how much of that have we already seen? Time to move on. ...I would avoid this film at all costs. ... There is little to look at on the DVD. The others have some interesting ""making of"" features, even with some cool behind the scenes footage and cast and crew interviews. There is nothing like that, just the theater trailer and a feeble attempt at a ""making of"" that is hardly worth watching. But if you should see it, then be prepared. ...

936551,3,6304844948,"So, basically, after Ripley died they cloned her (still with an alien inside), took out the alien, then decided that they might as well keep the Ripley clone, because, you know, why not? Alrighty, that's the storyline done with, now onto the gooey alien killing bits.
Maybe people who are not fans of the original Alien movies should see this film. They might enjoy it more. After all there are lots of exploding alien special effects, a few nice one-liners and dirty-looking metal spaceship corridors in profusion (why don't people ever decorate their spaceships?). However if you're a fan you could be disappointed.
Probably the best part of this movie is the relationship between Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Call (Winona Ryder). They really knock sparks off of each other; perhaps most of the chemistry seems to come from Weaver but it's pretty good anyway. Enigmatic super-Ripley is a force to be reckoned with, and Ryder is an interesting choice - pixie-ish and a little creepy, really.
In the end, it's a no-brainer. Some of the scenes are interesting individually - but to be honest the entire movie doesn't stay in your head for too long after you watch it.

936553,4,6304844948,"Many people think that Alien Resurrection is the worst of the series. After all, just what did they do here? A comical romp through the Aliens theme park? This film runs like a comic book even more so than the other three and presents a massive challenge to the viewer, especially to the fan of the series, many of whom were disappointed by this fourth installment. This review is intended as a defense, in the hope that frowners may want to screen it again. It contains many spoilers for those who have not seen it.
First of all, Resurrection IS the weakest of the four, but in company so strong, that is not much of an insult. You have to give it up to the series for continually daring to do something different with each film, something that no other franchise can claim. And this certainly aids the continuity of the series, rather than detracting from it. Ripley gets closer and closer to the beast, each step leading her into darker and more psychologically terrifying places.
Resurrection is the most comical, tongue in cheek, seeming almost to mock the entire series; but simultaneously it is the most grotesque and emotionally twisted, besting even David Cronenburg's films in terms of intimately disturbing horror scenes. The mother theme reaches what must be its peak here, with the amazing near-end birthing scene and Ripley's symbolic vacuum killing of her child, the abortion to end all abortions. Also taken to new levels is the hallmark distrust of humanity, particularly that of men. Surving are a male who can only be described as a likeable neanderthal, a disabled human essentially fused with a machine, and the two lead protagonists, both of whom are female, non-human, and who show by far the most compassion in the film. Important also are the series' issues of trust, immediacy, loneliness, and sacrifice, which are not forgotten here. Resurrection brings self-confrontation to the forefront (as it would tend to, one imagines).
Essentially, with a story as surprisingly inexhaustable as Dan O' Bannon's original Alien concept, it would be a waste to try and rehash old formulas to bring in sales, and I think it is wonderful that the producers of the films were able to keep it fresh. I was initially shocked at what appeared to be a horrible irreverence toward the mastery of the first three  films (yes, THREE, don't tell me I have to write a defense of Alien3 as well) but cooled off after opening night, thought about the continuing story, watched it again, and was mesmerized. How about it? Rent the DVD, turn it up loud and watch the amazing stock of stars and character actors keep this series up there at the TOP of the sci-fi jungle (mythological sci-fi western operas nonwithstanding).",1029369600,2,2721,4.826552462526767
936604,2,6304844948,"When I sat down in the movie theater, I was expecting to see the next great sci-fi/horror film. What I, and everyone else in the theater viewed was something entirely different. Saved only by the excellent special effects and cunning action sequences, this movie was nearly a waste of admission. The plot was a real reacher even though it used the familiar 'trapped on an infested spaceship' story line.
Ripley's death at the end of Alien 3 was a very important event, and the introduction of a Ripley clone in 'Resurrection' seemed to take away some of that importance. Everything that Ripley had fought and died for turned out to be pointless.
The soundtrack was not anything like the first 3 movies. The new music hurt the atmosphere of this film greatly. Needless to say, this is the only Alien soundtrack I don't (and won't) own.
This movie makes me miss the days of the original trilogy and just goes to show that even the greatest of all time can be subjected to bad sequels. To sum it up in two phrases: 1)Don't fix it if it ain't broke. 2)Stop kicking the dead horse-it won't get up.",1029369600,,1092,4.548223350253807
936605,2,6304844948,"After the Alien series was nearly ruined by the dreadful Alien 3, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet tried to breathe new life into the series as he takes the helm in Alien Resurrection, the fourth film in the long running series.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, looking badass as possible) is resurrected hundreds of years into the future through cloning techniques, and so had the Alien queen she was impregnated with in Alien 3.  But through a mishap in the experiment, she has gained some special abilities, and a bad attitude.  A ship of space pirates soon arrives, and of course we all know what happens next.  Weaver, as usual, is great in her role, but the rest of the cast is so-so.  Winona Ryder's talent is wasted in her role, and her ""relationship"" with Ripley isn't very convincing.  Ron Pearlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, and Dan Hedaya were good choices, though it would have been nice to see Wincott in the movie for longer than he was.  Now onto the Aliens themselves: we get to see some of the Aliens in CGI effect, and it looks a lot better than it did in Alien 3, but for some reason, they just don't feel creepy anymore, they're just not scary like they were in the first two films.  Not to mention that the ""Newborn"" Alien, a hybrid of the Alien and human chromosomes, is a disappointment as well, and the hokey ending seals up this package.  But there are a few good points: the direction is nicely done, it seems Jeunet tried to reproduce Ridley Scott's claustrophobic feel to the film, and he nearly succeds, and the special effects used when the Newborn is dispatched are nice touches as well.  All in all, Alien Resurrection isn't as bad as Alien 3 was, but with another film rumored to be in the works, all the credibility and innovation the series once had is quickly fading.",1026432000,,1797,4.5875

Jean-Pierre Jeunet is to the ""Alien"" movies, what Richard Pryor was to the ""Superman"" movies  - It may have seemed like a mistake at the time, but upon seeing the final product, I think we all agree that both were excellent decisions that brought new life to a tired franchise.

Of course it requires a stretch of the imagination, you fools, it's NOT REAL.
Anyway, as for the movie itself, I thought it was quite good and a big improvemnt over the highly dissapointing Alien 3.  The plot is that Riply has been cloned, 200 years after she dies, in a plan to resurrect the alien species for miltary study.  Of course all hell breaks loose when the aliens break out of their holding cells with a nice crew of hardass criminals to chase around.  The acting is fine and the set is awesome in a dark, Nine Inch Nails video sort of way, but what I liked most was how the film really put the spotlight on the aliens.  Here we're shown their true intelligence, particularly in their initial escape from their captures, and also treated to an impressive display of hydrodynamic grace.  The queen alien is here too, but only briefly, due to the fact she is turned on by the grotesque hybrid Riply-alien, quite a disgusting looking monster.  The new addition is all fine and good but I would have rather seen the queen in action, walking around and opening a can of whoop-a in all her new CGI glory.

That's the only real good idea of this movie, because from that point on it gets really stupid.
Sigourney Weaver's acting seems incrediably forced (it was rumored she wanted no part in the 4th installment but was persuaded by a large sum of money-10+ million) as does all the rest of the acting. Character development is poor and the range of characters is weird. If its its own movie its okay, but compared to the other Alien movies its a waste of time and money.

Sigourney Weaver is excellent in this one, building on her character with the premise that she's cloned from her original self. Most critics moaned about Winona Ryder being ""out of place"" but I think she does really well considering she's in unfamiliar territory. Also, there's a nice ensemble of hardass mecenaries to get picked off by the aliens one by one.

And yes this film wasn't exactley The Piano but it was a good film. It really showed off the aliens intelligence, however, the were very poorly designed in this film, being very abstract from H.R. Gigers origional design. But the film was riddled with highs and lows. For the lows the top of my list was the special effects. I can't emphasize who poor CGI can look when done improperly, as done in this film, if 95% of all onscreen aliens weren't CGI this film would have been much better, The aliens were cartoons panted into live action, it was like big grotesque Roger Rabbits walking around. Instead of spending millions of bucks on CGI why not guys in suits? It worked in the two most successful films within the franchise. The other two beefs with this film are Winona Ryder (AKA Call) and the Newborn (AKA The worst looking monster ever to curse the silver screen) both were mistakes in ever since of the word, Winona Ryder sold this film in no way, the directors attempts at having her give a nervous glance when someone say something in order to foreshadow something she completely misses her mark and doesn't sell it at all. I swear the Olsen twins would have been better suited for the part. Now we come to the Newborn, this atrocity, has to be one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen, and not the good disgusting either. First it killed the queen, and there was no retaliation by the drones in the hive, then it went on a kill crazy rampage for no apparent reason. I found the design poor H.R. Giger was quoted as saying ""That looks like ...."", and he was not incorrect. However, I feel the good in this film out weighs the bad. This is by far the most visually stunning alien film, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet gave this film great style. The film had a great DP, Darius Kondjis work is the stuff of legends nowadays. A great set design, second only to Alien in the franchise.

With my two younger sisters beside me we sat through one Alien after the other, and they seemed to like this one the most. One of them said it tied with Alien's as her favorite.
Ripley is back for her fourth and final time as a cloned alien cross-breed. When a group of merceneries arrives at her station with people/lab mice meant for harvesting aliens, Ripley develop's a relationship with Wynona Ryder.
The special effects are great, great, great, but the final bow was taken with Alien's. Alien 3 made sure of that. Unfortunately if a sequel(3) before a sequel (Res) is terrible, then you are likely not to be in tune with the character during the last installment.
I did feel sympathy for Ripley, and her offspring. I even felt sorry for the queen Alien. But, sorrow doesn't always comply with a story. The acting on all counts was pretty good. There really wasn't a terrible acting job in the whole film.",1013385600,,1227,4.602739726027397

It inspired me to watch the other 3 films again. And then I realised how much it ruins the entire trilogy that comes before it. The first three had original storylines, great sets, superb acting, action, some humour and were of a high standard. The first three movies came to a convincing end in Alien 3 after the action of Aliens and the horror of Alien. I love those films. This movie does not really convey any of the strengths of the first 3 films. I believe the storyline for Resurrection is workable and actually very good, and could have been a worthy sequel. But it isnt, it is poorly done. It just looks like a comic movie compared to the others, from looks to feel to acting.

After his first two masterpieces, the City of Lost Children and Delicatessen, he got his chance to come to Hollywood and direct.  But an Alien film?  He must have been a fan, that is the only excuse....
I cannot in good conscious recommend this movie to any Jeunet fans out there.  As this is not the product of him, but more likely inept film-editors and producers.  It is utterly and completely lacking of the fairy tale-esque brightness he usually brings to his films. If you're a fan of his, you will be disappointed.  Stylistically, it is sub-par compared to his other films, especially the magnificent new Amelie.  Storywise, it was written by the exec. producer to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer tv series, need I say more?  Acting wise, Jeunet regulars Pinon and Perlman give decent performances,  as does Weaver to an extent.  Ryder and the rest of the cast are disappointing, but there obviously wasn't much to work with.
I decided to give it 2 stars instead of one because Jeunet took a dead series and gave it cpr for a brief shimmering moment, but that light faded very early on.  Better than the rest of the dismal Alien movies though.... : )",1010102400,3,1238,4.5565610859728505

Ron Perlman had the absolutely worst lines, yet he managed to create a memorable, convincing character out of such unpromising material.  That's a credit both to his acting prowess and to the direction.  The latter has a twisted, creepy feel so reminiscent of David Cronenberg that DC and Jeunet must be soul mates.  Still, one has to wonder why Jeunet didn't insist on improvements to the screenplay, so my compliments to him have to be somewhat backhanded.
If you're expecting the film to hit the heights of the first two, you'll be disappointed.

The scene where she uses the flame thrower to put them out of their misery was the most chilling.

However a prerequisite of any sequels ought to be that production standards are either maintained or surpassed. While there is no shortage of stars in this picture, acting talent is lacking in a couple of them. The three main females have acting ability, beauty, and sexiness, but sadly none has all three at the same time. Ron Perlman makes a good baddie, but why does Hollywood almost always portray people with facial disfigurement as evil? Think back to Phantom Of The Opera, Frankenstein, right through to the Batman films and you'll get my point. This is counterbalanced somewhat by the use of a strong wheelchair-bound character, although  sadly he is only present sporadically throughout the movie. The wheelchair is one of the best special effects used here, with the remainder being of poor quality or, in the case of the Alien creature, overexposed and overused. The menace and hence the appeal of the Alien is diminished y our clear views of it, and it looks like something a fan knocked up in a couple of days.

Suddenly Ripley is living again and the ""cloned"" Ripley has super powers. The script is assembled with judicious use of the ""Cut & Paste"" feature (literally, several lines are _from_ Aliens, and the end is the same as Alien and Aliens). Gone is any spark of inginuity or creativity.
In fairness, there are some cool scenes (I always liked the underwater sequence, though many think it wooden) and Winnona Ryder and Sigourney Weaver turn in decent performances, but it has all become painting by numbers.

MY REVIEW:
""If you think this is a fourth installment of the ALIEN series, you are correct.  The only thing I'm going to point out, is that it is a spoof-like adventure movie.  The acting was bad, the alien effects were bad, the story sucks and watching it can annoy you, especially listening to WINONA RYDER being foul at the mouth.  ALIEN 4 should've been much more adventrous, scary, good with effects (like ALIENS), and better with the way RIPLEY came back.  If there is a fifth ALIEN movie, let's hope it is a good one like the first two.
Now let's talk about the end- IT IS HORRIBLE. [....]  Well, I think this about raps up my review. ALIEN RESURRECTION is a waste of time, and is just an odd way to continue the ALIEN movies.

936782,2,6304844948,"My title says it all.  The movie had very good concepts, but managed to spoil every one by trying to rush the movie along its two hour time track.  Yes, it had weapons, fighting, blood, and aliens creeping up on people, but it lacked the depth that made the first three alien movies so good.  It tried too hard to take bits and pieces that fall into the standard alien look-and-feel and cobbled them together into a 4th movie.  Little or no character development, and no time was invested in developing a background that could snare the interest of a new generation of movie goers.  In other words no passion.
Yes, I include the 3rd movie in the list of good ones.  The focus of the 3rd was not action (which dissapointed many) but tragety, hardship, and perseverence instead.  I think it conveyed those concepts successfully, and provided excellent acting.  It also gave people who loved the first two a sense of finality, which really makes the 4th film hard to like.

This is by far junk meant to cash in on a franchise that should have died with the original Ripley in the lead foundry at the end of Alien 3. Honestly folks, lets chat about how bad the concept was.
The bad guy corporation was able to recover enough DNA from the burning lead to develop both a Ridley and an Alien. Okay whatever. Then pixie Ryder turns out to be a super android-great.
There are so many ways that this sucks, and I think there is no finer pair of SCI FI movies outside Star War and Empire than Alien and Aliens.

936784,1,6304844948,"I'm sorry, but I grew up with the Alien series from the time I was little.  When I was 8, a friend brought over ""Aliens"" and we watched it with a large group of friends.  I was hooked from then on, and have always held an affinity for the series.  ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", and ""Alien 3"" were all superb instances of sci-fi horror, made even better if one has read the comic series produced by Dark Horse (which I have).  ""Alien Resurrection"", however, takes all that made this series good and throws it away.
""Alien Resurrection"" is quite possibly the poorest movie I have seen, a fact that is made worse by the superb quality of the previous three (though some may disagree on the quality of ""Alien 3"").  The characters aren't interesting, the Aliens aren't really all that creepy, and the ""new"" Ripley is just dumb. My biggest complaint of all, and many purists would agree, is that they constantly show the Aliens moving around the ship.  What made the first three films great is the fact that you really didn't know where the Aliens were until the big climax at the end.  This film traipses the Aliens across the screen for what seems like forever, ruining the suspense of the unknown.  How can something surprise you if you know where it is?
I won't say this film doesn't have its good moments; the scene as the soldiers attempt to evacuate their doomed ship is particularly well-done.  The evil scientist's fate in the hive is particularly nice too, despite the idiocy of the altered hive-queen that follows.
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who loved the first films.  Instead I would say to read the excellent comic series and buy the first films.  ""Alien Resurrection"" is a waste.",992390400,4,1691,4.622073578595318
936785,5,6304844948,"I have to admit to being stupefied by the level of hostility aimed at Alien Resurrection in some of these reviews.  True, there were flaws, but in my opinion the bonuses so greatly outweighed them that I was able to forgive them for the most part.  Oddly enough, it seems to me that with just a little more attention the plot problems could have been easily solved--why put the crew of the Betty in a situation where they are able to sneak weapons aboard a military vehicle in spite of being searched by both man and machine?  Why introduce a character whose shooting skills are superhuman--better in my view not to put the characters in situations where that kind of escape is needed (like avoiding Rambo-esque characters need to avoid outrunning machinegun bullets, one of my pet peeves).  And why have the bad science--acid eating through inert glass, the entire ""genetic memory"" bit is completely bogus (knowing how to fly a spaceship is not contained within one's DNA!), it is very questionable as to whether Ripley's blood sample would contain any alien DNA, and a vaccum strong enough to suck a very large object through a tiny hole is not strong enough to suck out all the air in the compartment, killing those left behind?
In spite of these crudities, though, there was much to recommend in Alien Resurrection. In general I'm not a fan of sequels--in fact I hated Aliens (Alien 2)--because all too often they simply rehash the same story, the same characters both good and bad, the same sets and special effects, etc.  But Alien Resurrection twists the Alien series in a unique way.  We get plenty of the familiar but updated superbly--the alien is back, redesigned to move somewhat differently and a bit sleeker, the face-huggers and chestburster make cameos, the queen returns with a much more terrifying mouth, and of course Ripley is back again, this time as a human/alien hybrid, colder, less compassionate and more distant, much harder to empathise with.  Special effects are more than superb, as is a consistent hallmark of the series.  The new creature, and the hybrids 1-7 (the most harrowing scene in the film!) are spectacularly monstrous.  The crew of the Betty, especially Winona Ryder as the new empathetic character Annalee Call, Ron Perlman as Crewman Johner, Dominique Pinon as the wheelchair-bound Chief Mechanic Vriess, and a very brief appearance by Michael Wincott (who recently stole the show as Gary Soneji in Along Came a Spider), are a superbly cast lot of misfits seemingly as alien as the creatures themselves.  The film revels in the quirky, too; with the casting of Dan Hedaya as General Perez, in the camera shot down the throat of a ""cannon-fodder"" character, and in Brad Dourif's eerie mugging with the alien.  Some viewers might well have found these touches distracting, but they gave a real sense of individuality from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Some critics have decried the film as simply a chase through empty rooms in which aliens occassionally pop up, but it was so much more than that--the film was an exploration of the interplay of relationships between characters, and between characters and aliens, which was far more than just kill or be killed.  It has always been noteworthy that the Corporation is as inhuman as the creatures; but now the creatures are more human, with jealousies, erotic drives, planning, revenge, teamwork, murder, and natural childbirth(!); while the humans are more physically alien than ever before.  Ultimately it is probably that Alien Resurrection delivered something unexpected, with subtleties beyond the typical Hollywood sequel fare, that has led to the number of unfavorable reviews.  But for me, it was not only the best of the series (at least since the first) but unquestionably one of the best horror films yet made.  Most highly recommended.",992131200,5,3837,4.971875

And that's kinda too bad as I would have liked to see the sequel to this one. Alien 3 trashed the series and like the title promises, I think Alien Ressurection did a pretty good job of creating something new out of the wreckage that was Alien 3.  If you loved the first two movies and hoped to see a replay. You are going on an entirely different ride.  Alien 3 was a cynical take on the saga that was brooding and dark but without the heart of the first two films. While the first two films leave us with hope for the future. Alien 3 left us with nothing but emptiness and a cheap death for Ripley.  Alien 4 says, ""Hey, this series can never be the same now. But it was rife with great ideas when it was destroyed. Lets take what's left, let our imaginations run wild and explore every possibility.""  To appreciate Alien Ressurection you have to have at least a remote appreciation of the modern comic book and japanese anime. Alien Ressurection invests heavily in these two traditions by building bigger than life characters with simple motivations and complex personal histories. The characters are the kind comic people like. Mercenaries with guns and gravely voices, Evil genetic scientists, pretty female androids, and a genetically-engineered Ripley built with alien DNA. Everyone is tough. Everyone has an edge or an angle. The film is one story but plays out like several issues of a comic. It starts with one neat idea, then plays it out building to a big climactic revelation that leads you on to new territory you look forward to exploring.  This movie is eye and mind candy and if your sci fi lovin' personality falls under my umbrella.

936788,1,6304844948,"Despite what most people have said, the fourth installment in the Aliens saga did managed to elicit strong feelings from me - namely bordeom. I could have easily (and in retrospect should have) got up and walked away after about the fiftieth time someone sprouted the now-typical action movie dialogue that is supposed to be witty or profound or something but means absolutely nothing, i.e: ""You find this funny don't you?"" ""I find a lot of things funny now, but I don't think they are."" Get back to me if you figure out what that means.  It's this ridiculous predictability of the absurd that flows throughout the entire film, like a strange sort of harmony. Perhaps if you were one of the movie's titular aliens and had never seen an action flick before, you might be saying things like ""They're going underwater. Oh-no, the aliens can swim TOO! Who'd have thought?"" or ""The hatch won't close. Yikes, there's an alien ON THE SHIP! I never would have guessed!"", but I don't think so.  Confounding this, I couldn't for the life of me figure out who I was to root for: the impossibly slimy alien puppets/poorly rendered CG images, or the murderous, foul-mouthed, lecherous band of grimy space-pirate-trucker guys. It doesn't help the fact that Sigourney Weaver's character, the one person you could ALWAYS root for in at least the first two movies, spends half the film sniffing people and mumbling, and the other half making love to alien warriors. Hey, great.  But the worst part of it all was that the filmmakers assumed the viewer would have the intelligence of, say, a post-it note. Every stereotype was shoved blatantly down the viewer's throat, just in case they couldn't figure it out themselves: he's walking down a silent hallway for about a half an hour; its scary, get it? They're playing god, so they're being killed, get it? This mentality sort of sums up the entire yawn-inducing ordeal. It's an Aliens movie, so its good, get it?

This movie disgraces the Alien franchise. The plot is horrible.  Ripley should have stayed dead.  Alien 3 should have brought closure to this series before they could screw it up more, but it is too late.  With no relevance to any of the previous Alien movies, this seems more along the lines of a poor side-story or an 'original adventure' than an actual sequel to one of Science Fiction's greatest.  The Aliens do not resemble ANYTHING similar to what they looked like in the previous movies, poorly explained by the rather lame idea of a combination of Alien and Human genes.  These creatures are more along the lines of 'Dinaliens' (Combo of Dinosaur and Alien), as they walk like and nearly look like the dreaded Velociraptors from another classic, Jurassic Park.  The roaring of the beasts is also clearly out of character of the aliens, as they wre more well known for their hissing and frightening screeching.  The movie gets steadily worse, as one of the scariest creatures in Sci Fi history, the Alien Queen herself, is shown as a horrible cross breed of human and alien genes, with a new method of 'birthing' aliens.  You'll see what I mean, and probably turn the movie off by that time.  The final creature is even worse.  My recommendation is to not buy this movie.  And if you feel you must see it, turn it off about an hour and 20 minutes in so you miss the worst parts.

That movie's nihilistic deconstructionist view of life ruined everything that had been built by the first two films (I couldn't help but think that Frank Miller had a part in the movie's creation). After the dismal ALIEN 3, I was hoping for a better movie in ALIEN RESURRECTION and wasn't too disappointed. I knew that as part of the plot, Ripley had been cloned and unlike some, was not upset by that. Ripley is one tough cookie and though she died a hero's death in ALIEN 3, it's nice to see her get another chance.
I thoroughly enjoyed ALIEN RESURRECTION until the last twenty minutes of the film. Granted the plot was true to the formula of a usual Hollywood sci-fi action flick. Nevertheless, there is a lot that made this film better than the last Alien film. Ripley's back with Alien DNA that gives her some very useful gifts, there are a few interesting twists (what is Winona Ryder's character hiding), and we get to see the Aliens swimming underwater. However, the last twenty minutes of the film ruined all the good points of the movie. I won't give the ending away, but those last twenty minutes turned the film into a live action cartoon. I guess the writers got lazy at the end, giving their job to the special effects people and this is the sfx team's way of getting back (movie- making fact: one great way to ruin any movie is to have cheesy effects, unless of course you're making a cheesy movie).
Overall, ALIEN RESURRECTION is a decent sci-fi film. As part of the Alien franchise, it doesn't compare to the first two films, but brings some hope back into the series after the bleak ALIEN 3.",987120000,5,1640,4.525252525252525

936862,1,6304844948,"I'm a sci-fi fan and have seen all the alien movies yet made.  This one is even worse then the previous one, Alien 3.  It seems that after watching the first two alien films that the producers have run out of ideas.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the only reason that people keep coming to see these films.  Don't get me wrong, I like Alien and Aliens, but these films go way downhill in quality after the second film.  It seems that they keep trying to bring Ripley back, eventhough she is killed in the third film.  This movie series is like a nightmare that won't end.  It starts out scary, but like all nightmares, it should end. Instead we are force fed more of these gruesome flicks like Jason and Freddy Kruger, Michael Miers, etc.  Just end the damn series and get on with something else. Getting away from that analogy, I don't understand this preoccupation with english speaking accents. Why do all the actors except Ripley, have to speak with an english accent.  It sounds so corney, since the first two movies have no- one with an accent. NO offense to english people intended!  Other then that, this movie is a continuation of an old, overused plot, with little or no thrill like the first or second movies.  I just don't find this movie scary, its just guts and gore something that would make you sick to your stomach, not scared. And like Alien 3, Alien Resurrection does not have anything in comon with Alien and Aliens, it just flat out sucks.

However, after a poor third outing, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet directs an appropriately dark and somewhat eerie set design. And while the script has a creative premise, the script fails to develop characters or plot points, and fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion. Winona Ryder is completely wasted as an android aboard the ill-fated spacecraft, though Weaver is still effective as a cloned Ripley. But of course, the main attraction is the aliens themselves.

The cloning story was a good idea, and Sigourney Weaver gives a superb performance as the now slightly twisted Ripley, but I don't know why Winona Ryder is in this one.  Someone screwed up the aliens' look, now they are somewhat cartoonish, like some sort of videogame. Someone at the movie theater laughed when the hybrid was shown near the end and it maked me wonder if someone at Fox payed close attention before releasing this one.

This time around, its 200 years later. The Military resurrects the long dead Ripley from blood samples they retrived from the prison planet of Alien 3(a little hard to belive since she was burned in the furnace at the end). Anyways the decide to resurrect her to get the alien from her. They start their own race of the aliens. Soon they escape and the people of the ship have to run for their lives, including visitors from another ship thats docked their. Good entry, yet lacks some true alien fun. I can't say i loved Winona Ryder in this movie. Maybe if they make Alien 5 it will be better. Rated R for violence, language, alien gore, and some brief nudity.",973728000,,916,4.3313953488372094
936963,1,6304844948,"Of the four Alien films, this one has to be the scum on the base of the barrel.  Apparently, it isn't enough that the story has very little to do  with the Alien mythology, but the director also tries to poke fun at the  legacy of the series ... and fails.  For some reason, it just doesn't feel  right to try to make a pastiche of what has become legend among  movie-goers, and try to include that pastiche in with the regular series.  It's too much like a slap iin the face.
Furthermore, the movie is riddled  with inaccuracies.  How could scienctists clone Ripley ALONG WITH the alien  inside of her?  The alien and Ripley are two separate life-forms, and  without both strands of DNA, it would only be scientifically possible to  clone one of them, not the both of them together.  How can Ripley tear out  an alien tongue if the aliens have acid for blood?  And the whole  mother/baby alien bit is too much to accept; even if science could develop  one clone inside another from a single strand of DNA, it's too implausible  to think that the human clone could pass along some of her traits to the  ""offspring.""  Nothing adds up, and very little makes any  sense.
And even if you could ignore all that, what about the acting?  The  actors all play stereotypical characters, except for Winona Ryder, who  plays her usual, whiny, stock character, and I kept thinking that if there  were anyone not suited to be in an Alien film, she's the one.  Still, I  have to admit, Sigourney Weaver plays a different sort of Ripley, which  shows off a bit more of her range, and I was pretty impressed with her  naive, bad-attitude self.  Unfortunately, that's the only bright spot. The  other three films focus so much on the characteristics that set the human  race apart from the aliens, and that gives the movies a touch of depth.  Resurrection misses that point entirely. I guess having a clone and a robot  as the main characters detracts too much from that theme.
I can't even  say much for the action sequences, which are supposed to be so much  different from anything else on the screen. Ooh, an underwater scene. (Seen  it.) Aliens popping out of floors. (Deja vu!) Big guns and bad-asses.  (Yawn.) And instead of trying to actually scare us with the aliens, the  director uses buckets and buckets of blood that are supposed to provide us  with the horror. Remember how claustrophobic the first movie was? How about  the sense of helplessness in the second movie, or the desperation in the  third? THAT's horror. It gets under your skin, not all over your  clothes.
Each of the Alien movies set out to reset the standard of movies  of its type, and each one -- including Alien 3 -- did so. Resurrection is  just a hodgepodge of the main elements of the previous films, but done much  less successfully than the others. Even if you don't compare this movie to  the other three, it's still a failure, because it's nearly impossible to  care for any of the characters.  No one acts human, and only half of them  ARE human.
Do yourself a favor: if you love the Alien series, skip this  one. Play the Highlander 2 game and pretend like it doesn't even exist.",968284800,19,3154,4.5213523131672595

But  overall, ""Alien Resurrection"" is an exercise in ponderous style  that ultimately doesn't even seem too stylish.  Darius Khondji's studied,  heavily textured cinematography is stunning, and certainly a technical  marvel, but it makes the whole movie seem as though it's been preserved in  amber.  This leaden artificiality-- which goes for Jeunet's direction as a  whole-- leaves the film with little emotional force and, after a point,  little point in continuing. Sure, since Ripley's dead anyway, this film is  freed by the ""alienation effect"" from having to be true to its  predecessors, and it seems to be trying to function like a Greek satyr play  to the serious trilogy it follows. The over-the-top performances from  Hedaya and Freeman give the film some sparks of pleasure; but the pirate  crew is almost universally unendurable, as is the poor schmuck with an  alien fetus inside him.  And what in the name of god is the subtext in  nuking subSaharan Africa?:  it would seem that keeping the aliens from  landing on earth has cost a couple of billion lives anyway.  Perhaps  ""Alien Resurrection"" is trying to be a live-action anime film,  but that is hardly a worthy idea to follow the greatness of  ""Alien"" and  ""Aliens.""  One has to respect the fact  that Hollywood itself respected the series enough to recruit artists like  Jeunet and Khondji to work on this project; but for whatever reasons, the  results are considerably less than one would hope for.",966297600,2,1610,5.015209125475285

The actors curiously talked like they thought they were making a  prison film or perhaps a low-budget Mexican western.  Clint Eastwood extras  would be embarrassed to say some of the lines.
Winona Ryder is horribly  miscast and looks and sounds stupid, although her voice is kind of amusing,  especially if you like to hear her say ""f---.""  (I kinda like it.)  Sig  Weaver is semi-interesting in a bloodless and buff sort of way; but the  rest of this dreary, low-brow space shoot `em up with monsters, is a yawn.  If you get off on gross biological freaks in formaldehyde, however, or like  to pucker up to T Rex teeth dripping acid, or go for that special feel of  flesh being ripped, etc., this might be for you.
Absolutely worst line  (but funny as twice-removed accidental humor) is Ron Perlman's comment  (after Weaver burns and blows away the grotesque embryos and her own  twisted, misshapen clone)  ""Must be a chick thing.""
Banal observation:  you'd think after all the years in space, evolving away from mother earth,  there would be some advance in degenerate habits; but no, these space  terrorists still smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey-and I'M SURE basketball  with metal nets will still be played on playgrounds orbiting around  Jupiter.
Banal observation number two: with all that fire power, you'd  think they'd blow holes in the ship and lose all the air.  Alas,  no.
There's a special place in hell for people who produce movies like  this.  In it they are fastened into seats with their eye lids propped open,  forced to watch their creations for eternity.

Sure, in this movie, the acting is better, the special effects are better, and there are plenty of guns and  fights and neat action sequences.

Also, compared  to Aliens, this aliens are nothing.  In the superior second film of the  series, the marines would spray an Alien with 15 shots or so, most of which  would bounce off, and maybe one would break the things carapace. Then, the  marine would be splattered with blood and burn.  In this film, 1 bullet  fired from underwater is enough to take down an alien, and in a scene where  a guy is splattered in the face with acid, it looks incredibly painful, but  takes away only a few layers of skin before it stops.
The  ""Newborn"" at the end is incredibly dumb -- it looked ling a  fleshy kangaroo alien, and it served no real purpose.
There's all kinds  of impossible bullet physics used, as well as contradictions to the earlier  films -- the Weyland-Yutani company from 1-3, is now the Weyland-Utanic  company, now defunct, for example.
Weaver's acting is appropriately  chilling and well done, but Ryder is very underused, and Christie's demise  is completely unnecessary -- plus, why would it necessarily kill him to  fall 30 feet into the water?

Enter Lt. Ellen Ripley. The brave  heroine we  all admired for her unwillingness to conform to the evils of mainstream  society and corporate cunning is  stuck with a band of mercenaries on a  military ship bound for earth.

The military team has secretly made a deal with the  mercenaries to spawn these creatures on a mass level. The film begins to  take on its familiar feel when the plan goes awry and the mercenaries are  left with no choice but to fend off  the creatures who are killing everyone  on the ship one by one.

Fittingly Ripley and Call show the most human character  despite their strange background. Most of the other characters are nothing  more than bait for the Aliens. Dominique Pinon as the crippled pirate is an  exception.
Being there are few surprises, this film works better as a  Sci-fi/horror adventure film. The story itself is worthy and interesting  but underdeveloped. Too much time is spent on the gory attacks. There are  too many unnecessary characters as well.
The production design and  special effects are first rate. The Alien effects by Alec Gillis and Tom  Woodruff Jr. are among the film's biggest problems. Their Alien creatures  lack all of the creepy and elegant work that H.R Giger and Stan Winston so  vividly created on the first two films.  Way too much slime and gore is  thrown at the audience here. The grotesque newborn alien is bizarre and  very slimy.
Alien Resurrection is certainly a strange entry of the Alien  films. Certainly not nearly as good as the first two, but it does work  better than Alien 3. The open and ambiguous ending does allow for another  film.  If so.. H.R. Giger and a great story are mandatory for it to work.",953856000,11,1953,4.875

If you missed the last one (almost the entire viewing public did), all you really need to know is that the perpetually soggy-haired Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died,  taking her toothy little friends with her. Now, 200 years later, the big  bad mama of sci-fi is actually a clone of the original.
Ripley II, we  soon find out, is really a half-breed-that's right, she's part alien-and  the madman science guys have ordered some fresh homo sapiens for more  experiments of the chest-popping variety. Oh, it's yucky, but in a good  way.
The story is one-note, horrific actually, but what did you expect.  Everyone gets trapped in the spaceship and spend most of the movie being  chased down eerie corridors or, most impressively, through a long,  underwater storage tank, where bullets travel more slowly and the aliens  swim like Mark Spitz.

As with my review of Alien 3, the  good first: the effects are awesome. The aliens look great, much, much  better than they did in Alien 3. Seeing them swim was like a dream come  true for me, as I always wondered what they look like in water. Aside from  that one scene in Aliens, I never saw this until now. Also, a lot of times  the sets look really cool (as always). This is actually a great movie  visually.
Now the bad: the characters, amusing and entertaining as they  may be, are stupid. Ripley is for the most part devoid of humanity, which  made me very sad. Also, almost the entire last quarter of the movie is  ridiculous. What happened? It wasn't spectacular before that, but it got  really bad at the end.

What I hated most about this sequel was the  mutilation of the Aliens. They are what draws people to the films, they are  completely menacing and terrifying. The one in Alien 3 personified this  completely but in this one the Aliens are slow and hardly ever move!  What was the meaning behind that (bad script, director are my answers). it  is just sad watching this movie, because i was watching the whole franchise  sink down the toilet. I do know that an Alien 5 is being written and has  the go-ahead to be made and from what I heard about the script I think I'm  better off watching my toilet function.

That's very bad for this franchise because that was its  hook.  The aliens in this 4th film were very unengaging and unfrightening.  Indeed, it appears now that with each sequel we get to see what new neat-o  cool thing they can do (so, in this one, we get to see the cute alien swim  underwater; maybe in the next film we can see it swing around via jungle  vines).  I feel like they have been reduced to being acts in a circus.  It  seems like the writers are struggling to find new things to do with the  aliens.
You will not get anything more out of this film than the first 3  films.  Everything in this one seems watered down.  The thrill and suspense  is gone.  The franchise has been run dry.  They need to just leave it  alone.  It's now getting tacky.  An undignified way for this solid  franchise to go.

I enjoyed the scenes where they were studying the aliens and I  enjoyed the concept of the alien mutations (both in the aliens and in  Ripley.)

I did find the half man/alien creature a bit of a  disappointment, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.  My favorite scene was  when Ron Perlman hangs upside down from the ladder and shoots the alien  coming up the ladder, then swings himself up only to to react in fear to a  spider in a web.  Before Resurrection came out I was hoping they would do a  sequel in which the aliens were being studied in a lab.  If another Alien  movie is done, I hope it deals with their planet of origin.  My suggestion:  humanoid bings on another planet developed the aliens as a sort of  bio-weapon (just like the Company wants to do by capturing one of them)  that goes awry and wipes out the cretors.

However there is one  stupid technical bug in this movie. The research vessel travels from  Jupiter to Earth only 2 hours. It means in the best case of shortest  possible distance it has speed 90000 km/s at least (in the worst case it is  130000). The ship was not moving before aliens escaped and acceleration  required to gain this speed simply squashes anything on the ship even the  ship itself.

Probably the most ludicrous part of  the movie was the ""richochet""  scene where one of the  guns-for-hire shoots his pistol in the air to hit the marine below (  totally out of place in the ALIENS universe ). It's saving grace was the  way the movie potrays the ALIENS, in that even though a threat to humanity  and must be exterminated, they still hold a loathsome beauty and grace that  man can only pervert and never perfect.

We knew a bunch of people would get stuck on a space station with some nasty aliens, most of them will die, a couple of survivors will get out, end of story.  Lots of drippy goopy  stuff, aliens jump out from behind (or above) characters, an excess of  blood-n-guts, etc.  No surprises here.  But...
I am not sure why people  are slamming this movie so hard.  Could it maybe, just maybe, be that BOTH  the leads are female, and that the core issues of the movie (behind the  usual slime-n-gymnastics-n- explosions formula) are things like integrity  and self-determination -- for female characters?  Maybe the  (stereotypically, according to the movie industry) youthful, almost  exclusively male audience for SF/action/thrillers just can't relate -- to  the malfeasance of medical professionals, the abuse of women's reproductive  capacity, the threat of secret weapons development, you know, totally  irrelevant non-issues :-)
What I wasn't expecting and what impressed me  was Sigourney Weaver's acting.  I have found her pretty wooden in other  films, including the first 3 Aliens.  In this one she really seemed to get  into the alien-ness of her part.  Even her facial features were subtly made  up to emphasize her odd bone structure -- her skinniness and this subtly  reptilian facial cast made her, imho, pretty spooky, and she managed to act  up to it without (most of the time) overacting.  In motion, facial  expression, body language, she never let down the role, and I appreciate  that.
The ""evil scientist"" theme (or the ""massive  irresponsibility of military research"" theme) is something else no one  mentions.  For my money, the mad scientists in this movie were all too  real.  We know these people.  They work at Los Alamos, at Lockheed, at  Morton Thiokol.  They love the engines of mass destruction that they build,  one suspects, with the same sick fascination the last surviving fictional  scientist shows for the next-generation alien.  There's more than a little  social commentary going on here.  Heavy handed, yes, but hey, this isn't  ""Forbidden Sun"" -- it's not even in the running for Most  Brainless SF Movie of All Time.  Not even in the minor leagues.
For me  the crux of the movie is Ripley's destruction of the lab where her failed  clones are preserved (dead, or more horribly, still living).  And my  interpretation of the opening voice-over is that, yes, there are monsters.  The real monsters on this station are the humans.  Space pirates selling  frozen bodies to the ghoul scientists who need alien-fodder -- the hideous,  suffering abortions in the lab -- how much more monstrous do you need to  get?
The script wavers unsuccessfully between high-school (well maybe  undergrad) humour and occasional moments of strong genuine feeling.  I wish  it had stuck to the dark-n-gloomy myself, the humour seemed  misplaced.
About Winona the less said the better.  Convincing neither as  a human being nor as an android.  What was she doing in this movie?  Was  Daryl Hannah not available or what [sorry, couldn't resist]...
Point I  have the most trouble with:  ditching the space craft into earth's  atmosphere.  If it hit about where you would think it hit from the  ""orbital picture"", the loss of life would be in the hundreds of  millions;  yet this goes by as an unquestioned plot mechanism;  not even  one of the characters has the grace to mention how many people are about to  experience the equivalent of several Hiroshimas.  I mind this a lot more  than I mind the amazing lung capacity of all those people swimming through  the flooded kitchen :-)  if you want a more realistic dive movie, watch the  director's cut of The Abyss.

Let's face it,  folks. This isn't PBS touchy-feely save-the-whales for college credit  stuff, it's sci-fi/horror entertainment. I wasn't interested in timing how  long everyone was underwater, and the fact that the Aliens still looked the  same as in the past three episodes didn't bother me (why the hell should  they look any different?) and as far as drool and gore go, isn't this part  and parcel of the unique ""charm"" of these creatures?
Comparison with the previous three episodes is unfair, as they all stand  on their own. Suspense, action, and even dark-side quasi interaction and  involvement with the species are represented separately in the first three,  and this one brings these elements together with another twist or two added  on for good measure. It took a couple of viewings of Alien III to  ""get"" it and I believe it is better in many ways than the  previous two. I believe that those who so dislike Resurrection will find  this to be a similar situation.
The only thing I really take issue with  is the mis-casting of Winona Rider. As good as actress as she is, I just  couldn't get into her playing the part here. Of course, this is only a  personal opinion (as is the balance of this review), but it appears that  this opinion is shared by most of us.
As far as sequels go, as mentioned  it opened the door for at least another. However, did anyone notice in  Preditor II the ""Preditor"" skull collection? Sure enough, one of  those belonged to one of the ""Alien"" series creatures. There are  a series of ""Alien"" novels published, and several of these deal  with Preditors and Aliens...seems to me that this is the wave of the future  if the series continues. I hope it does. And they do end up running amock  on Earth. Cool!",928195200,,1948,4.678466076696165
937487,2,6304844948,"Upon hearing that another sequel to Alien was being made, I did not know whether to be optimistict or petrified. By killing all of the Aliens survivers off in Alien3, the series was ruined for me. Dispite that, I  still payed $7 to see Resurrection. I should have saved my time and money  because this movie was a complete waste. Resurrection is basicly a retread  of the first 2 movies with cloning as the plot point used to bring Weaver,  the star, back. Because we already know what the nature of the aliens is,  they are no longer frightening as they were in ""Alien"". We know  they have 2 sets of teeth and like to drip goo all over. This movie also  was not as action packed as ""Aliens"". Not one time was I on the  edge of my seat with my heart pounding so hard I thought everyone around me  could hear it. Even the underwater chase seemed slow and dull compared to  ""Aliens"". This movie also lacked interesting characters that we  could sympathize with and cheer for. W.Ryder's character was underdeveloped and her story was never fleshed out. Also, Ryder was a very poor choice for this role. The 2  stars had absolutely no chemistry. My biggest gripe with this movie were  the enormous inconsistencies in the story. Sometimes there would be acid  for blood then other times, like the alien tongue scene, there would be  none. Where did the eggs come from? Swimming underwater for more than 3  minutes? I don't think so. Was this movie supposed to be a comedy or was  that just a accident??? If you want horror, rent Alien. If you want action  rent Aliens. If you want to see a good movie, stay far away from this load  of garbage.",926467200,9,1638,4.436241610738255
937488,4,6304844948,"I saw this movie in the theatre, and I don't regret doing so for a second.  I've been a long-time fan of the Alien movie series, and I must say, I've immensely enjoyed all 4, even the third.  While Resurrection doesn't come  close to the quality of Aliens (the 2nd film), it has some good points.  Fast plot, humour, cool effects.  The addition of Winona Ryder is  excellent.  Overall, decent film.",923529600,,398,4.52112676056338
937489,4,6304844948,This ALIEN movie is a definite winner. The character of rippley is packed with attitude.  WEAVER is finaly let loose to do what she allways does with a twist.rippley is no longer totaly human. SHES GOT A BUG UP HER A**!,923184000,,219,4.341463414634147

7878129,3,6304844948,"I loved Alien and Aliens. Didn't much like Alien III,  and I like Resurrection even less.  I thought that Gary Dourdan did a decent job with his poorly written character. However, and quite sadly, there wasn't much dimension to any of the characters in the story. The cartoonish personalities of the ship's crew and superhero-ish capabilities of the merchants and Ripley were clownish and absurd. It was obvious that Signourney Weaver couldn't properly dribble a ball. So why put her in such a ridiculous situation? Just do something more convincing. My son showed better dribbling skills when he was a toddler than Weaver demonstrated in the movie. Ron Pearlman's character just sucked in every imaginable way. The ship's general reminded me of Daffy Duck. The scenes with the alien erotica, Weaver hound dog sniffing the air, and her so-called alien death stare were completely laughable. While I respect the importance of the first two Alien productions to the sci-fi genre, I feel that this one basically screwed the franchise.",1525910400,,1031,5.094674556213017

7878137,1,6304844948,"Not  being  satisfied  with  Ripley's  decision  to  kill  herself  at  the  end  of  Alien 3,  the  company  decides  to  remake  her.  Clone  her  I  guess.  &  holds  her  like  a  prisoner  until  her  memory  is  fully  restored  like.  The  question  is,  are  they  just  using  her  to  capture  the  alien,  or  do  they  really  care  about  Ripley's  well  being,  &  what  she  stands  for?  The  answer  is  no.  Prisoners  are  being  delivered  to  the  station  to  receive  a  harsh  death  penalty  for  their  crimes,  to  create  a  horde  of  aliens  which  run  amok  on  the  huge  space  ship  forcing  what's  left  of  the  crew  to  retreat.  This  is  most  definitely  what  I'd  call  a  Sci Fi  movie.  We  get  to  see  unfinished  half  human  half  aliens  glass  barrier  containers  in  a  lab,  A  project  by  the  evil  looking  scientists  which  never  got  finished,  those  things  were  even  uglier  then  the  aliens  themselves.  None  of  the  Japanese  scientists  ever  really  cared  about  what  happened  to  the  crew.  Just  about  themselves.  &  I  enjoyed  watching  those  creepy  looking  dudes  die  finally......
The  movie  isn't  that  bad,  except  for  parts  like  this,  when  this  one  guy  finds  out  he  has  an  alien  inside  of  him,  he  moves  around  a  little  too  much  when  the  alien  is  starting  to  burst  out  of  him,  &  didn't  act  like  he  was  in  that  much  pain.  The  first  movie  Alien  starring  John Hurt, Tom Skerrit, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, &  Sigourney Weaver,  I  thought  that  was  a  scary  movie.  This  movie  is  so  horrible  its  even  hard  to  believe  its  part  of  the  alien  series.
If  it  was  worth  something  at  all,  I'd  like  to  see  this  one  end  where  Ripley  finally  gets  returned  to  company  Headquarters  from  movie  Aliens,  where  I  knew  she  would  have  gone  if  she'd  hadn't  died  in  alien  3.  Its  odd  how  she  never  reunited  with  her  cat  Jones y....
&  it  would  have  been  a  good  ending  to  this  movie.  All  they  do  is  arrive  on  planet  earth  to  witness  the  sunrise.  Sigourney  Weaver  &  Ron Pearlman  were  the  only  actors  I  cared  for.  Its  not  all  that  scarier,  just  more  freakier  &  weirder  then  the  others.  I  mean  if  know  anything  here,  let  me  at  least  say  that  the  Marines  in  aliens  did  a  heck  of  a  lot  better  against  the  aliens.  Victory  prevails  as  usual  in  this  movie.  So  what???  The  plots  in  this  final  sequel  are  ridiculous.....",1515801600,,2600,4.38780487804878
