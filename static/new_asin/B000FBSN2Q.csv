2712864,3,B000FBSN2Q,There's not much to say about this flick other that the fact that it started out as a comedy and remained so throughout the whole movie. There were a few good fight scenes but you could still get a laugh out of almost every one of them! Gordon Liu was the only believable actor in the this flick as someone who didn't know what was going on. This movie is not to be taken seriously but still good to watch! Spend as little money on this as possible. Just because it was made by Run Run Shaw doesn't make it a good movie.,1247356800,,520,4.058252427184466

At the same time scaming the shaolin monks which is Gordon Liu character and avoiding the police and the villian Johnny Wang who is also trying to find this treasure. There are a few good fight scenes in this movie one being the scene between Gordon Lui and Wilson Tung, the star in this movie is the woman fighter who plays Johnny Wangs daugter she is great with the double blades. This is Alexander Fu Shengs first film after recovering from 2 broken legs so you can see his fights are limited.",1219708800,,656,4.429752066115703

8163636,3,B000FBSN2Q,"Dubbed in Mandarin with English subtitles.  This movie doesn't have a strong plot, but has a little humor and excellent fight scenes.  The plot is just a Shaolin monk is visiting all the clan on his way to the Temple.  However, each time visits a clan, the clan chief is killed.  One of the major clan chiefs who is the actual killer is going around claiming that the monk is killing everyone for the treasure at the temple.  So, all the clans, one by one tries to kill the monk as they are all greedy for the treasure, only to find that the monk is super skilled at kung-fu.  In one of the fights, the monk is hurt, but two scoundrels offered to help as they were once greedy, but wants to do good now.  Fight scenes include a female fighter who is super flexible and offers some of the best fights in the movie.",1501200000,,813,4.2064516129032254

8163638,1,B000FBSN2Q,"I skipped the middle hour of the movie because up to that point, the movie was that stupid and that unfunny. There was occasionally good fight scenes, but the plot was poor and most of the actors just showed up to collect their paycheck as opposed to entertaining the audience.",1497657600,,277,4.56
8163639,5,B000FBSN2Q,"The Shaw Brothers machine cranks out another kung fu classic which is one for different reasons. This one ranks highly among those with a healthy injection of comedy. This film was directed by Lia Chia Yung. While his category isn't nearly as large as his more famous brother Lia Chia Liang, he did helm movies such as Odd Couple, Fists & Guts, He Has Nothing But Kung Fu & Dirty Kung Fu. The US title for this one is Master of Disaster which is a bit nonsensical when you actually watch this.

The plot revolves around two con men (Fu Sheng & his real life brother Chang Chan Peng) who puts their heads together to get their hands on a treasure map. Word is the treasure is housed in a temple tied to revered monk Wu Song (Gordon Liu). Also hot on their trail is Lord Mo (Wang Lung Wei) & his mute deadly sister (Yang Ching Ching) as well as a bumbling police chief (Tu Shiao Ming). Also in this is the director himself in a cameo role & Wilson Tong.

Fu Sheng lights up the screen in his 1st performance after breaking his leg in the film Heroes Shed No Tears. Seems like he didn't lose all that in way of his kung fu skills, but his comedic prowess was turned way up a notch. His younger brother did favorably well in his film debut with both his comedy & martial arts. Gordon Liu does well, not 36th Chamber or 8 Diagram Pole Fighter-like but good enough. Wang Lung Wei was his usual badass & ruthless self. Yang Ching Ching kinda stole the show with her amazing double sword skills. While Tu Shiao Ming didn't do a great deal of fighting, his comedic role fitted him perfectly in this.

Overall, this one delivers on story, comedy & action! I put this right up there with any early Jackie Chan films & the same breath as I would put another great movie with a similar blend, The Loot. Just turn off your brain, sit back & enjoy this 100+ minutes of pure entertainment!",1494633600,,1873,4.285310734463277
