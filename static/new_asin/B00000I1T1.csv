7909504,5,B00000I1T1,I really enjoyed this Zatoichi adventure. Not just because of the swordwork which is great in all of them but because of the intricate storytelling and plot in this one which was really incredible. I loved the gambling scene in the beginning of this one and how the story unfolded after that was great. I own quite a few of these films and have yet to be dissapointed in any one of them.

7909505,4,B00000I1T1,"Another in a fine series of Shintaro Katsu films.  If you are a fan of any  of his previous Blind Swordsman series, you will love this one just the  same.
After watching two or three of the series, I have wanted to get  the whole series.  If possible you should try to get the special that has  all the videos for a discounted price since it is a bulk purchase.
If you  are a first time Blind Swordsman viewer, i advise renting any of the series  from Blockbuster to see if you like it before you spent a larger amount  purchasing something you might not like.",960940800,,560,4.2075471698113205
