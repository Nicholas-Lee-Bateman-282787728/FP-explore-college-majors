6589844,5,B00MN9PQ7I,"One great TV show.
But why did they not give us season 14 the way it should be.. ?They are leaving the one that is a mess out.
Why did they not redo it the right way?  And then move on to 15....",1413417600,,194,3.511627906976744
6589845,5,B00MN9PQ7I,"The 14th season ended with the departure of long-time series regular, Jerry Orbach and his character Detective Lennie Briscoe. Filling in his place as was Detective Joe Fontana played by Dennis Farina(former Chicago Police officer, if i may add). This season we see the detectives take on cases ranging from Abu Ghraib to flu shot shortages to a train accident. Another fun fact, season 15 has the most changes taking place throughout the season. A few episodes in and Elizabeth Rhom departs from the cast(with ADA Southerlyn leaving the audience surprised with a revelation no one could have seen coming[that is unless if you've seen it on youtube. If you haven't, then DON'T!]). She is replaced with Alex Borgia played by Annie Parise. But it doesn't end there. After Detective Green is injured(i.e. Jesse Martin takes leave to film Rent) Detective Nick Falco becomes Fontana's temporary partner while while Green recovers(i.e. while Martin films Rent). Also to note: this is Eric Overmeyer's last season as an executive producer as well Nick Santora's first and last(if you're into knowing whose responsible for making this season great). Also the episode ""Tombstone"" crosses over with the Law & Order: Trial By Jury episode ""Skeleton""(which is not included on in this DVD set. But buying Trial By Jury is totally worth it).
Any and every fan should buy season 15 because the quality, the writing and even the acting is top notch. And fans of the Sopranos, if you haven't noticed any yet, you will notice some familiar names and faces. Between 16 and 15, this one is better quality-wise.",1411171200,12,1590,4.981203007518797

6589859,4,B00MN9PQ7I,"I like this show, but I miss Angie Harmon. It was nice to have a prosecutor on the conservative side, though I guess you'll do that with Fred Dalton Thompson. Sam Watterson's character was a liberal, and Elizabeth Rohm's character is actually more liberal.
