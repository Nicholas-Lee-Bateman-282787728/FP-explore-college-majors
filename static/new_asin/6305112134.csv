Carry On Behind (1975) was the last good Carry On film but it bombed at the box office charts as did Carry On England (1976) which is understandable as its absolutley dreadful. Times were changing and the saucy seaside postcard humour was now considered old fashioned, especially as the smutty Confessions Of A... series were scoring high in the Box Office ratings.
In one last blatant attempt to revive the series, Producer of the series, Peter Rodgers and Director, Gerald Thomas, turned to the subject of the French soft-porn film series, Emanuelle. A lot of the regulars such as Hattie Jaques, Charles Hawtrey and Barbara Windsor had left the series some years before whilst the late, great Sid James, died in 1976 therefore leaving a big gap in the series that couldn't and never will be filled. The regulars that are present for this final instalment of the series are the outrageously camp, Kenneth Williams, the ever reliable, Joan Sims, as well as Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth and Jack Douglas (who became a regular in the series in the early seventies) and they all look a noticeably lot older. Suzanne Danielle is in the title role as the promiscuous Emmanuelle and is engaging in her role but not even having the sheer brilliance of Kenneth Williams camp humour manages to save this completley awful film. Interest wanes after just fiften minutes as the film just falls flat with no sense of direction. The capable cast all struggle against a script that is completley full of juvenile smut and jokes that all had been heard countless times in previous entries. The only scene that raises a laugh is where the gang are all discussing their most amorous experiences. Joan Sims recalls hers being in a laundrette where she meets a man who she is immediatley attracted to. They then use their laundry to act out their sexual fantasies. This scene is played out to perfection and you really have to see it to understand what I mean. But one good scene is hardly enough reason to watch this!
The film was an unsurprsing flop at cinemas and it served as the final nail in the coffin. This film was one that barley anybody had seen until it was released on video in the early 1990's, whilst on t.v it has only been shown late at night. An absolute mess  and one that is best forgotten.",990921600,3,2377,4.686602870813397
7883139,2,6305112134,"This is the last ever Carry On to be made and unfortunately it came at a time when the Carry On style was deeply unfashionable. The saucy innuendos of the aerlier movies was now considered old fashioned and comedy in 1978  consisted of full-on explicit sex jokes and four-letter words. This Carry  On has swearing and sex jokes, but it's so embarrasing to watch, not to  mention miserably unfunny, that it didn't seem worth making. Nevertheless,  Kenneth Williams' performance is stunning as the camp foreign ambassador  and Suznne Danielle is undeniably ravishing in the title role.",961459200,2,583,5.03125
7883140,4,6305112134,"Like fish and chips, ""Carry On"" films were a British institution of their day and are still loved today. This final entry (1978) has been more underrated than many of the others which is a pity because it's a  great romp. The only real demerit is that sadly, many well known cast  members weren't around for this one such as Hawtrey, Jaques and Conner but  the stars that were involved have put their best foot forward and delivered  great entertainment. Suzanne Dannielle is perfect as the sex-obsessed  Emmanuelle because she has the charm, beauty and sense of fun which are  essential to the character. Kenneth Williams is imaginably hilarious as her  fitness freak husband. A memorable scene in the film is when the  servants(Sims, Connor and Butterworth) describe their most unusual sexual  experiences. The films ending is also priceless. Like the other Carry On's  it's as corny and ridiculous as can be, but that's what we've come to love  about the series isn't it?",959212800,2,974,4.878048780487805
7883141,4,6305112134,"""Carry On Emmanuelle"" (GB 1978) is  not the best of the Carry On series (in fact it was the last) but there are many funny moments. Carry On king Kenneth Williams plays a French ambassador living in London, and when  his wife Emmanuelle (Suzanne Danielle) comes to stay, it's not just the  ambassador falling at her gorgeous feet! Everyone is in a sticky situation  after Emmanuelle's visit, and after she's seduced nearly every important  man in England! Although the acting has a lot to be desired, ""Carry On  Emmanuelle"" will look good in any collection of timeless British  comedy. (P.S. The title was originally spelt with a double 'n' in the  middle: ""Carry On Emmannuelle"")",923702400,3,680,4.852173913043479
