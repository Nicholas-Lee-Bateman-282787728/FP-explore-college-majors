7902251,5,1933919841,"Overview,

Tim Staples gives a talk about how he ended leaving ministry as a Baptist preacher and became Catholic.
The video is a live recording in a church setting , where Staples discusses his early life, his wayward years, his return to his home and Church in the Assembly of God.
To progress his education and to attain some discipline he joined the Marine Corps (he mentions an education is required to could become a preacher in the AOG church).
Staples discusses his constant sparring with a Catholic Sergeant Doula.
As he describes him, ""a catholic who could argue with me Biblically .. I was drooling"".
He then discusses how he left the Marine Corp but had an armful of content from Doula.
He tried to disprove or find error in the Catholic Church and what he learned from Doula, he describes how he felt he needed to go to Jimmy Swaggerts bible school to get the Catholic stuff out of his head.

A very entertaining, humorous and riveting talk.

The bad of this video-

The opening sequence and ending credits as well as menus do look very basic and a little cheesy. However, this is not a Hollywood blockbuster or a production by the History channel so that can be forgiven.

The talk is way too short. Not short meaning I felt short-changed by the talk, or I expected to get x amount of content but got half that. No, short as in , I wanted to hear more. A few times he said in his speech he said he hadnt got the time to go into things,
I wish he did, I wish there were multiple discs. I enjoyed what I got I wanted to hear more stories, more of the sparring with various characters,

The good- I watched this video 4 times on Sunday, 'nuf said.
I watched it without a break. When it finished , I started it again.

I would say however, from the speech,  Sergeant Doula didn't get enough credit. The title ""Jimmy Swaggert made me Catholic"" definitely grabs your attention more then ""Sergeant Doula from Okinawa made me Catholic""

The most enjoyable parts of this is how he describes the theological duals he had with his Sergeant. How he ended up defending the Catholic Church where he did not want to, how he started preaching Catholic teaching in a Assembly of God church, and the church went silent.

I really enjoyed this and am looking forward to watching it again..... this is a very enjoyable insight into how a person switches from thinking all catholics are pagans into becoming one himself.",1323043200,23,2413,4.488584474885845
