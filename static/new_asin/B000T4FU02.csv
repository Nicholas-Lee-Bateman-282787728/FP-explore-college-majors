8207805,5,B000T4FU02,"""Death Sentence"" (originally a 1972 Movie of the Week entitled ""After the Trial"") also stars Cloris Leachman and Laurence Luckinbill. Nick Nolte is the young man on trial for the murder of his wife, and Leachman is a bored housewife who's thrilled to have been picked to be on the jury (""I think this is the first time I've ever felt like a full-fledged member of this community!"").

Her excitement turns to fear, however, when the unfolding evidence begins to indicate that someone close to her may have actually committed the murder. The suspense culminates in a middle-of-the-night confrontation during a raging thunderstorm.

This film is a good example of the ""suspense"" genre of TV movie, with some genuinely suspenseful moments. It's solidly acted and scripted. ""Death Sentence"" is diverting for an evening's entertainment.",1337385600,,830,5.186567164179104
