8634150,4,B00HQ15P60,"Wilderness Survival Fires by the Global Survival Institute in Ohio has lots of good information and demos on starting fires and on various fire lays for various purposes.  I found it most informative and helpful.  With the following additions, this could be an excellent teaching aid.

I do think their tinder using mostly dry grass needs more discussion, to include inner bark of dead trees or down limbs, feather down, char clothe, shavings of dry wood, and 00000 steel wool.

They jump too fast in the size of their kindling.  Breaking off last years dead growth will make much smaller and drier tinder and is  available in most areas most of the year.  They show 2d year growth twigs which will work if very dry and the tinder is plentiful and good and very dry.  Smaller kindling leads to better fire starting success.

Their fire lays are of good variety, and well done.  The information on how to lay them and to use them is good.  I would have liked to see the reflective fire with the fire lit from the front of the reflector.  They do not discuss adding tinfoil or space blankets to increase the reflective heat to the leanto.  I also would have liked more discussion of the council fire lay for campfire programs as opposed to just a platform fire lay to keep the base of your fire out of the melting snow.

I think the Dakota fire holes are too destructive to the environment to be taught in today's world, leading to erosion.

There is an excellent discussion of the fiction bow method of starting a fire.  There are other friction methods that could be included such as the hand bow or the various bamboo or canoe type of friction apparatus which can be used on other hard woods.

They do discuss various flints on the market and their honest opinion of them.  This is helpful.  They also discuss the Orion Flare which is very useful for bugout bags and emergency quick fire starting.  Also batteries and lenses make a good source of energy (heat) for fire starting, and were not mentioned.

Overall a good fire starting program with the above cravats.",1396137600,,2066,4.574931880108992
