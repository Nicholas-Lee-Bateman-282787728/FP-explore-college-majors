7985325,5,B00008MJ34,First and foremost I like to say I'm a Sienna Guillory fan so my review will be kind of bias. With that being said Superstition is a type of movie you would enjoy if you like murder mysteries and don't mind the British accent. This is a pal DVD and will require a region free DVD player or software to convert to region 1 if you live in the US because it's set in region 2 and won't play properly in american region 1 DVD players. the weird part is after seeing this film I remember seeing it on TV a couple of years ago but the DVD is only in Region 2 which is a little weird but hey I enjoyed it.,1408838400,,598,3.869918699186992
