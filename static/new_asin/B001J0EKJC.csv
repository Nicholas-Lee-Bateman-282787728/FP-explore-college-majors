8311619,5,B001J0EKJC,"Very interesting DVD.  Not only aspiring knife-makers, but also general knife enthusiasts will appreciate this video, made by a master blade-maker, to better understand how these knives that fascinate us so much are really made!",1405814400,,228,5.514285714285714
8311620,5,B001J0EKJC,"This is a lengthy video on how to make one of the most difficult knives out there. I am a knife collector, not a knifemaker. I like the Loveless style knives and bought this to see what makes them so expensive. Once you see how much work it takes, you will appreciate why they are so much. Steve Johnson makes it look really easy, but making a subhilt fighter is hard work. The video is over 3 hours long and takes up 2 disks. The producer told me at a knife show that he actually had almost 40 hours of footage that he had to edit down to the 3.5hrs of the DVD. So that shows how much time a subhilt takes to make. I enjoyed the video enough to watch it two or three times.",1384387200,2,674,3.963235294117647
