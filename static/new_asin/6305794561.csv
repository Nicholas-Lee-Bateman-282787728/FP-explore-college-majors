8215613,2,6305794561,This movie is hilarious. Sort of like Shaolin Chasity Kung fu. These 18 bronzegirl are guardians of the Temple & Must defend it at all cost. The funny part is that some of them are bronzeboys. & The gold paint looks like it's comming off on some of them. There is a part where they stand on each others shoulders and go around clanging people in the head with their heads. The sound effects sound like a Huge Liberty bell ringing whenever they hit someone. Funny stuff. No where near a classic but entertaining.,1005782400,,511,4.446808510638298
