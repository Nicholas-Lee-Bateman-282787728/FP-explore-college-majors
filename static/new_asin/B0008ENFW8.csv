2258264,2,B0008ENFW8,"While I can't say I hated this film, I can't say that I particularly liked it either.  As someone who spent most of his 20s and early 30s in the theater, I had great expectations of seeing something that I could relate to and that would leave me feeling inspired.  However, the world of this film is so formulaic and unrealistic that it makes it nearly impossible to translate it's message into the real world.

In the real world we actually have to work day jobs to make a living, community theater is mostly performed in tiny black boxes with virtually no budget and the actors are not classically trained and spouting memorized soliloquays for every occasion.

The relationships in the film were equally unrealistic.  It portrays community theater actors as these magical pixie folk who, again, don't need to sleep at night or work for a living because they are ""artists"".  They are all wacky and zany and immediately accept this man, with no experience and no talent who scores the lead in their play, as one of the family.  Other than the assigned villain of the piece, noone has an inflated ego and they are all divinely talented.  Even the utterly untalented Peter becomes an amazing actor overnight merely because the canned plot requires it.

Sure, it's only a movie.  But this one stretched my suspension of disbelief to the limits.  I found it to be saccharine and about as relevant as a Hallmark card.",1122249600,4,1413,4.680161943319838
2258265,4,B0008ENFW8,"BIGGER THAN THE SKY has the feel of an Indie that was made out of a lot of love and commitment from all concerned.  That's a good thing, but at the beginning of this little film the viewer  questions whether or not the actors can make the story fly - and if you actually want to take the trip with them. But stick it out because a sound film well made rewards the hesitation. It is a 'little man finds his way' tale that makes good sense and provides good entertainment.

Peter Rooker (Marcus Thomas) is in a depressed slump after his girlfriend has dumped him.  He is a 'cellophane man' computer artist, living the solitary life, noticed by no one, longing for a feeling of belonging.  The place is Portland, Oregon.  Peter notes the posting of auditions for a Portland Community Theater production of 'Cyrano de Bergerac' and slowly decides to attempt a moment of belonging by auditioning for the play: if he could just land a small part at least he'd belong.

At the auditions he meets the warmly friendly theatrical group: Michael (John Corbett) who is a fine actor with no sense of future, Grace (Amy Smart) a pretty young sprite and competent trouper, director Edwina (Clare Higgins) who is a true theater person preferring to unmask the real Cyrano rather than hide him behind the infamous nose, sassy costumer Mrs. Keene (Patty Duke), and theater founder and advisor Kippy (Alan Corduner) who has retired from the theater due to his progressive cancer.

To everyone's surprise, especially Peter's, Peter lands the title role of Cyrano while Michael becomes Christian and Grace becomes Roxanne.  Edwina's faith in the audition honesty of Peter has bolstered her own commitment to her dreams and she works with the cast to mold this very inexperienced (read lousy) actor into the tough role of Cyrano.  Peter finds joy in the camaraderie of the actors, and for the first time in his life he becomes a social person.  As the play is rehearsed Peter and Michael and Grace become a misguided trio - Peter does not understand the promiscuous life of the actors - and when Peter loses his job because of his increased involvement in the theater, he is informed that Edwina is forced to replace him with a seasoned actor Ken Zorbell (Sean Astin) at the 13th hour.

As good comedies go there are unexpected turns of events at every level of the remaining time until the opening night and the ending results in the personal growth of each of the actors and company.  There are some well-drawn performances from John Corbett, Amy Smart, Clare Higgins, Patty Duke (in two roles), Alan Corduner, and ultimately Marcus Taylor (he is so convincingly an untrained actor at the beginning of the film that the audience will think he is wholly without talent!).  Director Al Corley keeps the community theater magic alive and Rodney Patrick Vaccaro's script is sparkled by incidental quotes from Rostand's play. And to sum up the final product of the film in Cyrano's word, it has 'panache'.  Not a great film, but a warm little story that examines the lonely lives of people who need the stage of a community theater to find themselves.

2258266,4,B0008ENFW8,Enjoyable. Will most appeal to those who like to root for underdogs. Marcus Thomas is convincing as a untalented novice.  One of his best moments comes in a scene with Sean Astin. Patty Duke will double your pleasure. Film also pays tribute to those for whom theater is a labor of love.,1120608000,2,286,4.5
2258267,5,B0008ENFW8,"This DVD is worth having in your collection for one reason ~ a chance to see PATTY DUKE in a dual role!  While the film itself was released to limited areas, all the critics were unanimous in their praise for Duke.  It seems a shame that a rare talent such as hers is not utilized in today's theatrical releases.  The movie depicts a young man's journey to find himself and he lands an acting job in a local Theatrecompany.  He meets several interesting characters and two of them are played by PATTY DUKE ~ Duke's real life sonSean Astin also plays a role in this film.  ""Bigger Than the Sky"" is a DVD worth having in your collection if you are a fan of the theater ~ and a fanof fine acting.",1112918400,8,693,4.21969696969697

2258279,5,B0008ENFW8,"A lonely guy whose girlfriend has just dumped him decides to audition for a chorus role in a local community theatre production of  ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and is unexpectedly cast in the lead in this charming film about actors who love the craft but will never make it in the big time.

John Corbett and John Astin (pre-Lord of the Rings) have excellent supporting roles, respectively, as a good actor who just cannot make it outside of the small city, and a pompous entitled amateur who will be a familiar type to anyone who has ever done community theatre.  Patty Duke (John Astin's mom) also has a wonderful cameo-type part as the irascible assistant director/stage manager/costume mistress that every community theatre has and cannot do without.

Just an enjoyable, fun movie for all of us who love community theatre.  I loved it.",1398556800,,832,4.830985915492958
2258280,5,B0008ENFW8,"In my humble opinion, Cyrano de Bergerac is the best play ever written. Anything a person may desire in a story can be found in this masterpiece. Bigger Than The Sky is a fitting, gentle and sensitive tribute to Cyrano while being set in modern times. It is inspiring and wonderful to experience as is the play it is based upon. I do not know why this film was not a major film of its day but I feel truly sorry for anyone who did not see it for they missed an awesome story awesomely acted. This is a must see film for lovers of Cyrano, romance in its highest sense or just lovers of a funny and inspiring tale. My only disappointment is that the film did not use the Brian Hooker translation (the original is in French) but one of the lesser known translations. The Hooker translation was made for American audiences and is more meaningful and easier on the ear to American viewers. This does not in the least detract from this marvelous film or my recommendation of it.",1394236800,,972,4.346153846153846
2258281,5,B0008ENFW8,"This is an absolutely wonderfully played movie. You won't know anyone who has ever seen this movie but after you watch it, you won't know why.",1386460800,,142,4.5
2258282,5,B0008ENFW8,"I highly recommend this film; in particular, to anyone who has participated in community theater!

It beautifully sums up the personal growth, appreciation of great literature, relationship-building, and downright silliness and shenanigans embodied by the experience of theater from behind the curtain. The personalities of the main characters are three-dimensional, with all of their wonderful personal attributes and foibles evident. The magic is in the way they all interact with each other in such a plausible, entertaining (and perhaps even thought-provoking) way. And yet, they still have their personal mysteries as well. I especially appreciated the portrayal of the way in which each person interprets a work of great literature in their own unique way.

A great film for teachers of literature and theater to recommend to their students! I found myself inspired to go back and read Cyrano and then see it on the stage again.",1376352000,,934,5.346938775510204
2258283,5,B0008ENFW8,We really enjoyed this movie. Had heard a lot about it and were not disappointed. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well.,1369440000,,134,4.4

2258285,4,B0008ENFW8,"This modest film was an unexpectedly moving  and well crafted surprise.  Colorful without being self consciously so, the troupe (with the exception of one particularly narcissistic attention seeker played hilariously by the actor-formerly-known-as-Samwise-Gamchee) draws new life and energy into the protagonist's tame and predictable routine.",1360454400,,343,6.6
2258286,5,B0008ENFW8,"I had no expectations about this movie and ended up totally falling in love with it.  Each actor played his/her role to perfection!

2258287,5,B0008ENFW8,"I don't know why the film is titled as it is, or why the description summary of the film is so lacking; the only thing I do know for sure is that this film is so much greater than anything I've seen in a long, long time. It's unpredictable in many ways and that's what I love about it. And it's believable. I don't want to give away any spoilers except to say that ""Bigger Than the Sky"" is charming, innocent, witty, sad, celebratory and whimsical while managing to capture how people can care about each other in any situation, without egos spoiling the love. And make no mistake, this IS a love story, just not the kind most of us are used to viewing.",1350864000,2,653,4.232
2258308,5,B0008ENFW8,Theatre is really fabulous in this great film ! All performers are interesting in their roles. My personal favorite is the talented Patty Duke in two roles !Take a chance on this one.,1332288000,2,183,4.575757575757576
2258309,4,B0008ENFW8,"This is a decent flick about community theater that is a little more down to earth than Waiting for Guffman. However, Bigger than the Sky is very campy and a little contrived at times especially with the dynamics of some of the relationships between the characters. Despite its shortcomings, Bigger than the Sky does show a good amount of humanity through its characters and plot development while enjoying all the excessive drama of a play within a play. For anyone who has felt like an outsider looking for a group of outsiders to fit in with, this might be an entertaining movie for you to relate to.",1329004800,,603,4.644859813084112
2258310,5,B0008ENFW8,"If you have never experienced community  theater,  this show is excellent to watch. Or if you have acting experience this show is also a must see.

 Recently , I had my first role in a play.  After the play was over,  a friend suggested watching  ""Bigger than the Sky"".  This movie  describes  very well what  community theater is like for a first time actor.",1325894400,,359,4.453125
2258311,5,B0008ENFW8,"When a novice actor joins a little theatre to meet people, he finds more there than just a line or two. Little theatre people become like family. Peter just can't act. Even with help, he just can't. After his part of Cyrano is given to another, he stays in the production, despite the ""enormous turd"" who takes his role. On opening night, the ""star"" is missing and Peter takes the role at the last moment and finds that he can do the role and wins a standing ovation, and long-lasting friendships.",1275955200,,497,4.472527472527473
2258312,4,B0008ENFW8,"I enjoyed the contrast of corporate life with entertainment values. A theater doing ""Cyrano"" is a bit more of a challenge than I would be willing to face in my personal life, but if offers plenty of surprises for a guy who always seems to read like he is reading. There is such a difference between the printed word and what goes on on stage, and hardly anyone can believe than an outsider to the whole culture of theater will pick it all up by opening night. Sean Austin and Patty Duke were the only names I recognized at the beginning. By the end of the film, I was only sure of 7 characters' names for the cast list, but by going back to the beginning of the story, it was easy to fill in my number 8, a boss at work who prizes team efforts.

Our society pays people to work, but it is not very clear about what is going to happen to those who quit to take part in things that happen in their hearts. At some point, another job might come along, but the chaos that is possible for people who really don't know what to expect probably deserves to be a much larger part of our culture, because that seems to be the direction we keep heading in spite of any attempts to smooth things out.",1239235200,,1188,4.142857142857143
2258313,4,B0008ENFW8,"I agree whole heartedly with the first review. A mixture of sweetness, hilarity, charm and wit, go into this familial theater film. As an actor involved with both community and professional theater, I related so well to the characters in this film. The egos, the artistry, the search for meaning, the sex; well, its all true. We've all felt the monotony of a meaningless job, but how many of us to take action and change our lives. This movie is inspires the courage to do just that. Lots of fun!",1176076800,,496,4.522222222222222
2258314,3,B0008ENFW8,"I have been involved in small-town community theatres for 26 years and I LOVED this movie, as did my teenage son who watched it with me.  We were able to correspond nearly every character to someone we knew from our own theatre experience and laughed until we cried at some of the antics. It's a little sentimental and is not the belly-laughing spoof of ""Waiting for Guffman"". It's more aligned with ""A Midwinter's Tale"" by Kenneth Branagh.  But it is DEFINITELY worth a look.",1175644800,,476,4.654761904761905
2258315,3,B0008ENFW8,"While discussing this earnestly contrived comedic melodrama that he scripts and in part produces, Michigan playwright Rodney Vaccaro states that the scenario results from a reaction to the ""9-11"" occurrences, and that his intention here is to create a romantic detailing of events that will provide a storyline antithetical to the violence that marbles our lives, while including his fondness for community based non-professional theatre as apt background for the narrative.  Peter Rucker (Marcus Thomas), a graphic designer with a marked personality deficit, is attempting to reconstitute his life after his girl friend has left him, doing so primarily through reading of self-help books, but is additionally attracted by a community theatre near to his place of employment that is advertising its auditions for Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, and since Peter's freshly imposed solitude has resulted in a surfeit of free time during his evenings, he determines to try out for a small part in the classic play.  Although totally lacking stage experience, or even middling innate Thespic ability, the play's director has ""seen something"" in him and Peter is unaccountably selected, not simply as a member of the cast, but as Cyrano, the lead!  Another member of the cast, Mike Degan (John Corbett), a very much experienced player, designates himself as Peter's mentor both during and between rehearsals; however, when Rucker begins to dally with Degan's former lover Grace (Amy Smart), the play's Roxanne, partly due to Mike's urging, the latter begins to resent his protg, weakening their bond, and this, in addition to unforeseen difficulties in mounting the production, must be rectified before the looming opening night performance.  Unfortunately, the film itself has troubles as well, and they are but seldom solved.  First-time director Al Corley permits the action to meander, with fifth-billed Thomas, fresh-faced but largely unskilled, a less than engaging Peter Rucker who is, near the film's end, abruptly replaced by first-billed Corbett as linchpin of the story, ratified by his ongoing connections with all of the other principals.  Although Peter is found to be completely inadequate as the featured performer, he quaintly is called upon to save the production after a newly appointed Cyrano becomes unavailable, an unconvincing gambit for one who, in reality, is only suitable for tech support or as a supernumerary.  In spite of these factors that weaken the piece's credibility it, ostensibly shot in Portland, Oregon, provides a pleasing quality of fellowship evidenced within its small community theatre group, and it treats of many standard stage related elements, both technical and non.  The film's most striking sequence is a splendidly realised ending that obviously was in the van of Vaccaro's creative impulses here, its preceding scenes for the most part subsequently crafted.  Originally named CAUGHT IN THE ACT, the production had to relinquish that title as it had been allocated elsewhere.  Although its box office take was low, a genuine affection for theatre is communicated throughout, and there is some rewarding conceptualization within Vaccaro's often literate screenplay, such as when the play's director, played by Clare Higgins, insists upon eschewing the work's customary emphasis upon Cyrano's proboscis in favour of an examination of his marrow.  Even though Corbett is given a misguided rant in one scene against the plays of Shakespeare, he handily wins acting honours.  Other meritable turns are to be enjoyed from the perfectly cast Higgins and her countryman Allan Corduner, who is given free rein. Patty Duke enjoys herself in a dual role, and Smart, who as an actress is an attractive young blonde, also enjoys herself.  In sum, then, this is a blemished but yet pleasing tribute to all community theatre associations that, in words from Rostand, ""work without one thought of gain or fame.""",1153180800,,3946,5.355411954765751
2258316,4,B0008ENFW8,"Actor Al Corley directed this film about community theatre.  Corley produced ""Drowning Mona"" with Bette Midler & Danny DeVito.  Marcus Thomas who stars here as Peter Rooker played Midler's son in that film.  Even though Thomas has acted in other films such as the street hustler in ""Noel"" with Susan Sarandon, his inexperience is SO convincing that you fully expect this to be his first film.  The community theatre is producing ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and the director Edwina wants to get to the ""inner Cyrano"" and decides to produce it without a nose.  Edwina is played by Clare Higgins who starred in a couple horror flicks in the 80s (""Hellraiser"" & ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"") as well as in ""Stage Beauties"" with Billy Crudup.  She believes in Rooker until his inexperience seems to make him unable to produce a good performance.  John Corbett who shined in TV's ""Northern Exposure"" and as the romantic lead in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" plays Michael, the semi-professional local theatre star whose Bohemian lifestyle leaves him living for the theatre.  Amy Smart who shined in ""Scotland PA,"" the tragicomedy adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" and also played with Ashton Kutcher in ""Butterfly Effect"" and with Owen Wilson & Ben Stiller in ""Starsky & Hutch"" does a great job as the local ingenue Grace who plays Roxanne in the local Cyrano production.  Both Michael & Peter fall for Grace and vie for her affections.  Michael lives with the former artistic director of the theatre named Kippy who now is dying of cancer.  Kippy is played by Alan Corduner who was in ""DeLovely"" & ""Vera Drake"" in 2004 and seems to have pearls of wisdom before he dies.  His memorial where his ashes are scattered in the theatre is an unusual moment.  Greg Germann who was Fish on the Ally McBeal TV show plays Peter's boss and is less than understanding about Peter's newfound interest in theatre.  Oscar winner Patty Duke (""The Miracle Worker"" from 1962) plays two roles, Mrs. Keene the stage manager who is a retiring spinsterish woman and Earline who is the flashy push-up bra costumer.  It's a fun dual role.  Her real-life son Sean Astin who assumed legendary status as Samwise Gamgee in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy plays Ken Zorbell, the know-it-all actor who replaces Peter.  When Duke locks Astin in the closet thus assuring Peter's opening night understudy performance, it's a rare mother-son scene.  I enjoyed this show.  It's a sweet domestic comedy with a great ensemble cast.  It gives a great sense of how theatre people revel in the magic of performance.  Enjoy!",1127088000,10,2568,4.884526558891455
2258317,4,B0008ENFW8,"Do you love ""Cyrano De Bergerac""?  Are you a fan of community theatre?  Has your life been a little dull lately?  Then you might want to check out this little movie about a man whose job, love life and personality are dull and uninteresting, until, on a whim, he tries out for a community theatre production of ""Cyrano"", and through a strange turn of events, ends up as the lead, beating out the much more obvious choice of the character played by John Corbett.  What follows are a lot of small bits that slowly add up to a whole:  a shy, dull man being urged to let his true nature out; an actress being pursued by the same quiet man and the wilder actor she used to date; the previous director of the theatre, and his passionate attitude towards life and death; a very strange pair of twin sisters, both played by Patty Duke (!), who couldn't be more different; a flamboyant, hammy actor played by Sean Astin (coincidentally, Patty Duke's son); and the whole threadbare but sincere passion for acting that infuses the whole company.  It's slow going for a bit - after all, the main character starts out as dull as dishwater, but he has to, for his character arc to work.  I found it had a sweet, offbeat charm, though.
