8685106,5,B000NVYRY6,This movies is Great! I watched it in Guadalajara on Labor Day Weekend 2006 when it was released to the theaters in Mexico with three of my best friends...we were all 30 at that time and it was funny to watch stuff we were going thru at our first existentialist crisis. Good Message delivered in a funny and smart way.,1173398400,,318,4.316666666666666
