8282275,2,B001B8ZLEU,"I had ordered some motivational speaker tapes and I thought that this was a motivational speaker dvd. This dvd was so worldly to me. I can pretty much tell (So I think) if someone has fasted for days before they delivered the message that you assume that God gave them to give to the people. It was so dry and so much of what we are not doing, etc., I felt that it was no anointing and it bored me so much, that I will either give it to the Good Will, or throw it away. I was very much disappointed. No power! I would not recommend it to anyone.",1399593600,,545,3.963636363636364
