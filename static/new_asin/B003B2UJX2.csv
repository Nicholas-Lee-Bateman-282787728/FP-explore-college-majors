8393366,5,B003B2UJX2,"Very crisp DVD transfer of one of the Garland TV shows I had not seen. There's rarely a dud in Garland's one-season TV series, with fabulous guest stars and beautifully designed for B&W registry.",1385337600,,195,4.764705882352941
8393367,4,B003B2UJX2,It took me a long time to find the Judy Garland Show on DVD but the wait was worth it. Seeing the old (B&W) shows (each one an hour) makes me wonder why they don't have professional variety shows any more. It's much better than talent competitions.,1379203200,,248,4.297872340425532
8393368,5,B003B2UJX2,"Following the release of ""The Judy Garland Show: Part 3"" on DVD comes Part 4. Infinity, the company releasing the episodes, should be applauded for their quick output of these discs and for the flawless presentation of these shows, all of which are over 40 years old. In this superb single disc collection comes two more episodes from the beloved variety series that originally aired on CBS in the 1963-1964 TV season. This set features episode #16 recorded December 13, 1963 and televised January 2, 1964. This show features the marvelous singer and entertainer Ethel Merman. The second episode was taped December 20, 1963 and broadcast on January 9, 1964 and features Vic Damone and Chita Rivera.  Songs from ""Gypsy"", ""West Side Story"", and ""Porgy and Bess"" are featured in these vintage shows. Unfortunately, there are no bonus features. ""The Judy Garland Show: Part 4"" drops in stores April 27, 2010. Enjoy some of the best television work ever made available on DVD.",1268006400,8,971,4.957055214723926
