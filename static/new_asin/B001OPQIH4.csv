3731470,5,B001OPQIH4,"Well, initially, when my friend got on me about watching this series, and I heard what it was about, I was a little skeptical about trying it out. I did the research on the series, and found out that it was adapted from a Japanese adult (hentai) video game on the computer. I wanted to start out this review by saying that there is very minimal adult material in this series. There's a bunch of fan service, but close to no nudity.
In Shuffle! the main character, Rin Tsuchimi is put in a situation (which you'll see as the series develops) where he must decide upon the girl he really loves. You'll meet some real over-the-top characters as it starts up.
They did a really good job with drawing the characters and environment; I was actually quite surprised. The theme song is rather catchy, in my opinion (coming from a person who normally detests that type of music). The dialog really isn't all that bad; there's a few corny jokes by today's standards, but I think it actually complements the series nicely. The actual story of it, without spoiling anything, was overall moving. There were a couple moments where I feel that it was a little too dramatic when I look at the series overall, but it was well done nonetheless.
All in all, I can't say there's too much wrong with this series at all, and it's definitely in my favorite pile. If you're a fan of cute girls, comedy, and school time drama, I'd recommend this to you.",1257724800,3,1428,4.496153846153846
3731471,3,B001OPQIH4,"Shuffle is a fairly standard harem comedy that is not ground breaking, yet is rather entertaining nontheless. It has decent characters and a rather good plotline.",1242000000,4,162,5.269230769230769
3731472,2,B001OPQIH4,"Speaking as a fan of the harem genre, I went into this show expecting nothing more than fun and entertaining antics with fanservice sprinkles. Unfortunately, upon finishing the first disc, I was filled with... well, nothing. The characters were cut-outs of the usual archetypes, and the comedy ranged from slightly amusing to lame and even to downright annoying. First, we have the token gals; Kaede the 60s housewife who lives to pamper Rin, Asa the energetic childhood friend, Sia the spunky fashionable girl, Primula the kid character, and Nerine the ""too shy"" girl who can sing well. All of these characters fail to impress or even in being anything distinguishable from the rest. It's comedic tropes depend largely on idiotic fanboys pestering the girls and hating Rin for being their center of attention. This just makes for situations that are beyond predictable and unfunny. Maybe if watching dense idiots do dense and idiotic things gets your funny bone, then you'll find it to be okay.
Another detriment to the first half of this series is the writing in the dialogue. With lines like ""Is it okay if I fall even more in love with you?"" and ""I'll have lots of babies for you, Rin!"" you may find yourself rolling your eyes and reaching for the stop button. And no, these are not the worst lines I could find, there are plenty more of the like, these are just the first two that came to mind. There are also many lack-luster and downright gut-churning confessions along way shrouded in scenarios such as 'girl trips and falls on guy' and 'young girl needs a bra, lets take Rin along for bra shopping' that are sure to get your gag reflex going, or just bore the hell out of you, whichever one comes first. Ultimately, the first half of the series is little more than the usual harem antics, just a lot more boring.
Its not until the second half of this series when things start to get interesting. Yes, if you could stomach your way through the first half, then strap yourself in, turn off the lights, and prepare yourself for one of the most unintentionally hilarious melodramatic farces you will ever see! The series takes a 180 and immediately turns a once pointless character into a plot-device (and then back to pointless), adds 'ghosts from the past' to another, and gives psychiatric problems to others. These twists come out of nowhere, and there are multiple times when the characters spend a majority of an episode sitting around blaming themselves for other peoples' problems. One character gets handed a murderous psychosis right out of left field. I guess the makers saw When They Cry and tried to mimick it last second, because this psychosis has no justifiable explanation and in the end, it just goes away, poof. This segment also features a laser-guided exacto-knife. Yes, watch this far and you can see how a simple exacto-knife can transcend the laws of physics.
The one redeeming quality to this farce is that a winner is indeed chosen; unfortunately, this leads into yet another off the wall life-or-death plot twist that plays through with the most nonsensical explanations, reasons, and resolutions. Yes indeed, what started as a lame excuse for a romantic comedy turned into a hilarious melodramatic farce that is sure to have you in tears of laughter. In fact, the characterization and plot are so weak in the first half that you can probably watch the first 2 episodes and then spare yourself the gag-inducing 3-10 episodes and just skip ahead to episode 11 (I believe is when it 'tries to be serious') and not miss much of anything. If you're up for it, I guarantee you will be entertained by how terrible the drama is done in this show, a 'How NOT to do' guide for making a romantic comedy/harem.",1241308800,8,3731,4.750385208012327
3731473,4,B001OPQIH4,"Qualifier:  I have only watched up through disk 4.  So far Shuffle is silly but surprisingly funny.  A couple times early on I almost turned it off only to find myself laughing out loud a few minutes later.  There are many adult references and some nudity so not for little kids but in all it's a lot of harmless fun.

If you want action, this is not the series for you.  If you want a good laugh, this just may do the trick.",1233446400,16,425,4.0602409638554215
3731474,5,B001OPQIH4,"i personally love romance anime, but there is also some comedy within it.  if that is what you are looking for look no further.  my heart really went out to each of the characters in the series. if you are looking for more anime like this i would suggest girls bravo, maburaho.  i wish they could have had a second season or maybe even a third; i know i would defiantly buy it.",1289520000,,377,4.136986301369863
3731475,5,B001OPQIH4,"I can't really comment on the DVD box set, but I would just like to say a little something for the series it's self. I've seen it in it's entirety subtitled and it's surprisingly good. It starts out as your typical romantic 'harem comedy' (main male character surounded by a bevy of beauties vying for his love resulting in frequent humorous situations) and for a while this proves to be true and appears to be less plot/character driven and more driven by the attraction of the beautiful girls. There's a 'magical girl' element to it as well, but this isn't explored in quite as much detail as other series of it's kind. But appearances are truly decieving with Shuffle!, the real selling point of this show are the characters. While many do fall into typical character molds you might see in other harem comedies, they are still carried out very well ad evolve over the course of the show. Not only are they beautifully drawn, but for the most part each one has a distinct, unique and likeable personality. I normally don't get overly attached to the characters in this type of series, but it was hard not to with this one. On top of this, towords the end the series begins to diverge from the predictable path you believe it to be going (and most other series in the genre would have gone) and begins to take a slightly more dramatic turn. The plot gains significant substance and explores darker emotional content that was largely unexpected. All this being said for the most part it is relatively 'innocent' compared to simmilar titles. I was surprised at the 'mature content' warning on it for the longest strech of the series really (it's mostly in the second half or so this starts to really become noticable), but don't get me wrong, the place it does end up in does require some mature context (I'd say 18 is an apropriate age range for it, maybe a mature 16). There is indeed a plethora of panty shots, usually managed to be kept in context however, and cleavage and towords the end there is some mild nudity (not full frontal), but this is managed to be kept in context as well for the most part and still feels largely innocent, it's a far cry from going out of their way to come up with an unrealistic boob flash. What really warrents the mature content warning though in my opinion is some of the depictions of events in the past that crop up near the end as well as were the series goes just before it's finish (don't worry though, the ending is still a light and happy one really.). That baing said again, all that is really done to enhance the plot which is made fairly gripping by the inclusion of it, it merely requires a mature understanding of the content (which is not actually sexual as you might think given the initial appeal of the series.).
I strongly recommend this to any fans of romance and comming of age anime. If you have trouble with it in the beginning thinking it's mostly fluf, hang in there, about a 3rd of the  way through you ought to have trouble taking your eyes off it. I innitially felt it was just another pretty girl fluff story and considered not continuing (despite expecting this when I went into it), the art was pretty enough to keep me going and I began to get very attached to the characters and even a little choked up during scenes in the second half or so to my embarassment.",1285804800,,3332,4.471264367816092
3731476,4,B001OPQIH4,"First, the first half of the series might have been suitable for older children and teens if not for the opening, closing and commercial break markers, and is still probably fine for mid to upper teens. Some of the subject matter on relationships may not be so suitable for immature teens. Note also, some of the subject matter may be disturbing to some parents, especially toward the end and at the ending of the series, which gets a little dark in parts.
Before getting into the sticking points, I'll say it's a pretty good series for mature audiences. (Due to conceptual content). I think it was worth the time to watch.
Despite there being magic in the setting and series, it's mostly played down and uncommon. The setting is modern day high school students stuff. The story is fairly standard One Boy, Four (plus) girls chasing him to be his girlfriend/wife type romantic comedy, at least to start with. The second half shifts to a lot of serious moments about the meaning of relationships and where to draw the line between friendships and competition (teen angst type stuff, but handled more maturely than most). Pulling the ""there's a second person inside of me"" trick twice seemed a bit flat. The final ""choice"" becomes predictable by (or before) 2/3 through the series, but seeing how he finally gets there and what he does about it keeps it interesting. Overall I'd call it above average, with excellent writing in the area of relationships and the dumb things some people do in or for them. The comedy drops off to a large extent in the second half of the series and it leans more toward a romantic drama. Personally I found this a little disappointing, but it didn't hurt the series overall. I'd say it was probably worth the money.",1284768000,,1745,4.687296416938111
3731477,5,B001OPQIH4,"Ok I just got this box set in the mail and I watched four episodes so far. And OMG, this series is sooo great! And I will tell you why:

The GOOD:
The storyline is so AWESOME. I didn't no how it would turn out until I watched the series (sometimes you hear of a good story plot for a movie but then when seeing it, it is not what you expected), but I'm so glad to say the story works GREAT. This anime features alot of atmosphere and has a good activity level. The characters are pretty awesome and *adorable (I also love the English voice overs). They have alot of qualities you will be attracted to. I found myself attached to certain characters for different reasons.
The comedy in this anime is so great actually. I'm not usually a fan of comedy in anime, but this comedy FITS perfect and is REALLY funny. I really am already getting attached to this anime because the elements are really well balanced. There are also some scenes of innocent adult ""moments,"" lol and they are *terrific....

The BAD:
<None>",1280448000,,1011,4.372340425531915
3731478,3,B001OPQIH4,"I admit it, I've played the H-game on which this is based. Honestly, its nothing special, just an ordinary H-game with a fairly interesting twist. Gods and demons are not only real in this world, they're running around on Earth and nobody seems to mind. Not only that but two princesses of the two races are in the same class. Still not enough? They both consider themselves betrothed to the same guy and he doesn't remember having met either of them. He also has a childhood friend, Kaede, a regular friend, Asa, and later on he meets Primula who fills the typical roles not already filled by the others. Oh, plus shes neither human, god nor demon.

But on to the anime. It has the same characters and for the most part, they're recognizable as their game counterparts, so I won't waste words summing it up again. Its probably nothing you haven't seen before. One guy inexplicably has girls who are way out of his league willing to give their souls for him, he mostly ignores them and they take that to mean they should try harder. You know, just like reality. Its like Tenchi Muyo!, without the cool sci-fi adventures or fresh for the time characters. Rin, the guy, is no Tenchi. While Tenchi is slapstick with a jumbo side of hero when needed, Rin is just kind of...there. Hes definitely an everyman, but thats all he is. Harem comedies work best when the guy is something above that or is driven. Tenchi is in line for the throne of a benevolent galactic empire, Negi Springfield is a wizard. Even Keitarou from Love Hina is at least determined. Rin is just there for the girls to desire and he isn't much of a character on his own.

Theres one character I really need to mention, but doing so will need spoilers. So, spoilers ahead. If you don't want them, just suffice it to say theres a severe downer arc (a downer arc is the point at which a normally upbeat series becomes depressing or dark) and skip to the next big space.

Still here? Neat. The anime's treatment of Kaede is really a mistake. Kaede has it bad for Rin because, after all, this is a harem anime and she is his childhood friend/sort-of-sister. Like I said, I've played the game and even if you choose another girl, Kaede is just kind of disappointed but still very sweet. She remains Rin's friend even if shes not his girlfriend. Its a bit cliche but thats okay because harem anime is built on cliches. Pick any girl from a modern harem manga and you could trace her personality type back to an eerily similar character from the 90s or even further. Going back to Tenchi Muyo!, in a lot of ways, Kaede is like Sasami. At least for a while.

In I think episode 22 or so, we start to see that things aren't quite right with her. She has dreams and flashbacks of strange things. As Rin's attention goes to another girl and even further from her, she changes. In the game, shes always the same person. In the anime, she goes violently insane. In some scenes, she reminds me of Rena from some of the Rena-did-it episodes of Higurashi. Twists are one thing, but Kaede seems like shes a gimmick shy of becoming a Batman villain. Its very abrupt, too. Literally, one episode has Rin on a date and the next has him dealing with an unstable Kaede. Its really weird they would put this kind of thing in a series thats so light-hearted almost throughout and its a little disturbing if you're not ready for it. It was also a huge letdown for me since I was rooting for her to bag Rin back when she was, you know, not nuts.

Okay, now that thats out of the way, heres more review for everyone. There is a pretty good amount of ero fan service here, but only a little plot-related fan service unless you're pulling for the right girl to end up with Rin. Thats one big plus to this series: unlike a lot of harem stories, this one ends with Rin choosing who he wants to be with. No cop out harem 'ending', no run off into the sunset leaving things unresolved crap. This anime doesn't just have an ending, it has a conclusion. So if you're tired of harem stories ending without resolving anything and are hesitant to try a new one, don't worry, Shuffle! has you covered. Plus some of the girls not chosen enter into relationships of their own, so its probably not a total loss for your girl of choice.

Should you buy it? Well, the simple answer is yes but if you already have a lot of other harem anime or don't love the genre, you could probably go ahead and skip Shuffle!. It doesn't blaze many trails and whats new may or may not be something you'll enjoy. Its a quality show, dubbed well, nothing really wrong with it. I watched it and liked it, but I found it for cheap. I didn't like the downer arc even for a downer arc, but you might. So, yeah, its not the worst thing you could spend your money on.",1277251200,4,4765,4.366403607666291
3731479,5,B001OPQIH4,"A truly delightful romance comedy/drama series. Rin has the luck/misfortune of being the object of affection for a bevy of cute girls. It is definitely a cut above your standard harem type anime, with good voice acting and over all decent animation. Although it is not overly sexual, it does have some very brief topless nudity. So if you have younger children and would prefer them to see violence and brutality instead of a minimum of cartoon nudity then it's best if you don't let them watch this heart warming story of undying friendship and true love.",1272240000,,556,4.742268041237113
3731480,5,B001OPQIH4,"Let me just start off and say that I am very, very hard to please when it comes to television shows. Furthermore, I am a huge anime fan and look for the same in them. Shuffle has got to be one of my favorite animes I have ever had the pleasure to watch. You honestly become friends with the characters and get to know them personally. Each character differs in their own way and it is so neat to see how they interact with one another. The only thing I was extremely upset about was that it only had 24 episodes! Something like this, in my opinion, should have many seasons. I don't understand how terrible shows on T.V. now have 100+ episodes, and something like this fails to have 30. To make a long story short, you need to see this! Any anime fan would love this and I could say that I would have paid more for it. In addition, I watched all 24 episodes in one sitting. I COULDN'T STOP WATCHING!

Overall: 9/10 A
Faults: Should be longer / more episodes.",1271462400,5,958,4.206521739130435
3731481,5,B001OPQIH4,"I've watched a lot of Anime lately.  I have always liked the action/adventure type anime, but this is one of the first ones I've watched that wasn't really focused on any sort of action.  I checked it out mainly because I was tired of my daughter making me watch iCarly all the time and since we like watching TV together I set off in search of some Anime shows she might like.

I'd intended to watch just one or two episodes to see if it was too violent or suggestive. She's 10, so I have to be careful what she watches. I ended up watching the whole series while I was at work over the last week or so. I'm not afraid to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I won't mind watching it again with her. I wasn't really concerned with the brief scenes of nudity in this series. It wasn't anything more than a flash here and there which I can stomach. We've watched Ranma 1/2 for a long time so I'm used to the cultural differences. I wouldn't suggest it for young children, but with supervision, I don't think there's anything too racy. They see worse just turning on the TV these days.

I have to say after watching shows like this that I can see why so many people enjoy Anime. The concepts aren't dumbed down because it's a cartoon.  So many American cartoons seem to think that children aren't capable of understanding subtlety. This series does not. The characters are deeply flawed in their own respects and make mistakes. Even Rin isn't perfect. I have to agree with most--I would have liked to have seen a longer story. But honestly, I think this is a story you could return to a year later and still have material to cover.  Plus I like the idea of telling a story from start to finish and not killing the characters over changing writers and new creative directions that happens in American series TV.

I really enjoyed this show, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something different from the standard faire. It was an enjoyable experience.  Funimation has a knack for bringing us good stuff.",1264723200,2,2012,4.418918918918919
3731482,5,B001OPQIH4,"I have to admit though, the only decent part of this series is the first disc because its silly and light hearted. Everything after that is all drama and a little to emotional than I thought. I didn't expect this anime to be this emotional or this dramatical and that caught me off guard. I don't have to go into detail, the past reviews already did this.

This is a good anime though and I didn't expect it. If you don't like emotional anime though, this might not be for you, but its still really good. Its not corny, its not lame and I don't think I have found a stupid part in this entire series after watching it.

This is for mature audiences only though. There are many scenes where the girls are dressed extremely skimply, shower scenes and you do get to see nipples (Sia, Keade, Asa-Sempai(I think)). If I heard correctly though, Shuffle! was a hentai game made into an anime, so its expected to have adult themes. Primula also does a lot of sex jokes to. This is kinda expected considering she is loli and in a lot of the anime and video games that has loli, their sense of humor is sexual, aggressive and very suggestive.

I honestly can't say anything bad about this anime because I enjoyed it. However like I mentioned before, everything past CD2 in this complete series gets very emotional and dramatic which caught me off guard. And the girls are hot, but its anime and its expected. Any anime that I enjoy will get 5 stars, and I enjoyed this one.",1261353600,,1463,4.391143911439114
3731483,5,B001OPQIH4,"Beautiful high school girls, a clueless but likeable guy, magic, angst, and quite a bit of fan service - Shuffle! is a fine example of the harem genre in anime.  Who would guess this anime, with its tender moments and sweet-natured plot, originated as an eroge (erotic dating game).  There may be some people who approach this series expecting (or fearing) the same content as the game, including the game's multiple alternate endings and pornographic scenes.  Wrong.  While the anime does take every available opportunity to flash panties and a few breasts, the series stays cleaner than your average primetime drama (think Desperate Housewives).  It's not for the under-13 set but those who enjoyed Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo will also love Shuffle!.

One thing to expect from this series is great voice acting from Jerry Jewell (well-known as Kyo from Fruits Basket) and Monica Rial (too many memorable roles to mention) as well as Funimation regulars Carrie Savage, Caitlin Glass, and Cherami Leigh, among others.

In short, there really isn't any reason to not give this anime a try.  You can even watch free episodes on Funimation's website to see if you like it before you buy it.",1259452800,,1186,4.924623115577889
8331038,5,B001OPQIH4,I enjoyed watching this anime series.  The story was excellent and it had a little drama.  I recommend this to all who love anime.,1454284800,,130,4.375
8331039,5,B001OPQIH4,"One of my favorite anime series, hands down. Don't know if this would still be available, but if you find it, buy it! Missed out on other series for that same reason. Wait too long and it won't be available on DVD anymore. :(",1404691200,,225,4.136363636363637
8331040,4,B001OPQIH4,"Over the summer, I decided before going to college was to look for a harem series on Netflex and watch the dub. This series is known for having a good English dub despite how most people always say the Japanese version is better. This claim is false because not only is the dub better, some things are changed to make thing easier. Its already stupid when the main guy Rin and one of his love interest is also named Rin so they changed her name to Nerine, and that sounds way better.

The story as mentioned is about an ordinary high school student Rin who as normal as he is and then suddenly God and Satan's child come to him and want to marry him because of something he did for them in the past. Their fathers encourage the battle for Rin's heart (and he's not too amused at this).

I like this harem series because there is so much character development within the episodes given. Each girl has their own arc so they're not being overshadowed by the other and all have an equal chance of getting Rin EXCEPT Primula (and this is because she has the body of a little girl and not wanting to go the controversial route in the anime, Primula is kept as a little sister despite having an arc midway through the season.) Each girl is shown to have strengths and weaknesses and all of them have issues that you wouldn't think this series would touch on.

Of course, everyone knows this series for the box cutter scene that a lot of people blow out of proportion and try to put this anime in School Days category.

That's the problem of this anime. Out of all the girls in the harem, I really hate Kaede. Now I already spoke in my Baka to the Test review that I have a strong hate for yandere characters given how much they can get away with despite them physically or emotionally hurting the people they claim to love. A lot of people feel sorry for what Kaede has to go through as the series goes on, but I honestly could not sympathize with Kaede. This jealousy she has for the girl that Rin has his sights on comes out of nowhere. She didn't show signs of this insanity when the other girls are around, so for her to flip out on this particular girl just seem to be her lashing out at the fact that she lost the guy she loved despite being there from the beginning. Plus given her backstory, I don't feel bad for her at all when she's the reason for the box cutter scene and I just see her whining during her arc when she needs to get over herself. I know this sounds harsh, but this is how I honestly feel about Kaede and I feel like her arc while it brought tension was just there to add a yandere given that not a lot of harem series actually have a yandere that actively tries to attack the competition and its played seriously (School Days doesn't count). I think the worse part is how Rin and the girl he likes are blamed for her craziness (I admit Rin is at fault for not paying attention to her mental health but she's been fine ever since her breakdown so how was he supposed to know she would crack again and only Primula watched it happen. Then the girl is blamed because she stole Rin away (and Kaede says she did) when Rin never even liked Kaede and even though she knew Kaede had feelings for Rin, all was fair in love and war and the other girls slowly gave up when they realized that Rin liked this girl.)

Beside my ranting, I think the missed opportunity was not expanding on the world of Shuffle. Shuffle is a world where demons, Gods and humans live in harmony and beside the Primula and Nerine arc (they share it), the Heaven/Hell is never touched upon and its just a waste given how all the girls seems to have some sort of magical power never touched on.

So overall I give the anime an 8/10 because of the unnecessary yandere arc (though I admit that during the breakdown, the English dub nailed Kaede's insanity perfectly and I give props for that) and not expanding on the magic world.",1362009600,2,3912,4.272604588394062
8331041,5,B001OPQIH4,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508

Shuffle is a drama where Rin, a highschool student living a normal life with his longtime friend, suddenly becomes every girls attention. Shuffle! Is one of my favorite dramas, up there with Clannad and Angel Beats. It keeps you locked in. The first half of the season sets you up and the second half, thats where things get interesting. This show is mainly drama but is very comical as well. You become attached to these characters as you progress though the show. Funny scenarios keep you coming back and wanting more. The drawing is a little outdated (2005) but is unique and it looks great on DVD. The soundtrack is well done and fits the scenes perfectly. This Box Set includes 24 episodes on 4 disks.

But most people who are going to watch this kind of anime aren't looking to find a tryly wonderful male character.  This kind on anime is about the girls and Shuffle delivers a solid group of girls who are different enough to be memorable even while they all fix into neat little cliche packages.

There are some scenes with fan service, but honestly its much less than other series I've watched.  There is nothing to put this series into my top 10, but I won't be relegating it to my circular file anytime soon.  If you like harem anime, this is a good one to purchase, otherwise I'd advise looking for other series.",1308700800,,783,4.328767123287672
8331046,5,B001OPQIH4,"A perplexing and heartfelt look into how our relationships affect everyone around us; even those we never expected. Behind the scantly-clad women and gratuitous fan-service lies an endearing tale of painful regret, violent longing, true friendship, and what it means to sincerely love someone.",1296691200,,293,5.681818181818182
8331047,5,B001OPQIH4,"I originally skipped over buying Shuffle! when it came out, based upon watching a trailer for it on other Funimation titles. Seriously, it looked like the entire premise was fan service, with ""All the panties! All the embarrassing moments!"" being key elements hyped in the trailer.

Having watched it through, though, the story isn't just fan service, although there is a lot in it. Maybe it's to get us men to consider it watching it, despite its dealing with complex relations and character development.

It is not as emotional as, say, Kanon, but it has many serious moments. And you do get to find out why the characters are the way they are... Well, I guess you don't find out WHY Rin is as nice as he is, but you do get to see the problems it causes, and just how far he's willing to go to help those he holds dear to him.

Is it a ""must own""? If you're a fan of Kanon, Clannad, Air, Chobits, and similar titles, probably. But, if fan service is all you're looking for, this is a rather expensive series for the amount you'd get.",1292198400,,1035,4.380208333333333
