8210425,2,B000TR5QB2,"Barbara Kopple's 1998 documentary on filmmaker Woody Allen's 1996 tour of Europe with his New Orleans Jazz Band (reputedly eighteen concerts, and seven countries, in twenty-three days), Wild Man Blues, is one of the most pointless, dull, and utterly inert documentaries I've ever seen. I've long been a fan of Allen's films, and even his worst films (see The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion) are a cut or three above their typical Hollywood counterparts. And Kopple is a noted documentarian of quality- see Harlan County, USA. But, this film is nothing but a manifest ploy to rehabilitate the man's image after his 1991 scandal of splitting up with actress Mia Farrow and shacking up with her daughter.

  Documentaries are supposed to enlighten and give insight into their subject matter. This film does not, even at a bloated hour and forty-five minutes in length. This could have been cut to an hour, with ease, had most of the execrable jazz been cut. It's not that the music is so bad as the fact that Allen and his compatriots are so utterly meager. Without Allen, the rest of the musicians could never have gotten a gig at a bar mitzvah.

  But, the real problem with Wild Man Blues is that Allen is never allowed to display his wit and intellect. There are a few good Vaudevillean one liners (a lady says to Allen, `You are so intelligent;' and he replies, `Well, yes. It is a burden, though, sometimes. With this much intelligence comes great responsibility. You know. It's lonely at the top.'), but mostly endless scenes of Allen blowing on his clarinet, making nice with Soon-Yi in their chi-chi hotel digs, hobnobbing with sycophantic mayors of European cities who give him the keys to their respective cities, and a number of oddball scenes that serve no purpose in the narrative- such as a French fan who disbelieves Allen has any prowess as a musician, only to- after the show, become a true convert. I mean, did the filmmaker- Kopple, really believe the viewer would be surprised or enlightened that the man had changed his opinion? There are about two minutes devoted to the scandal, an equal amount of time on Allen discussing his films, but absolutely nada on Allen's career in stand up comedy, early television, much less his day to day life before and during celebrity. So, again, what was the point for this film, save to burnish Allen's reputation as a human being?

  Perhaps that is good enough to carry a film if it provides a modicum of the other qualities previously mentioned. But, Wild Man Blues does not. Even for Allen fans who define the original intent of the term as fanatic, this film is something of coitus sans ejaculation. Nowhere do we get a glimpse of Allen unguarded; do we really believe that he and Soon-Yi in white robes, eating a gourmet Spanish breakfast, is a revelation of any sort? Of course, that question would be better addressed to director Kopple, who made a highly regarded Oscar winning1976 documentary called Harlan County U.S.A., about a miner's strike- as well as many others, but in this film seems to be on cruise control.

  At best, Wild Man Blues is a competent little film- a travelogue with a celebrity, but not one which will leave a lasting impression to the uninterested observer, even if it does, occasionally appeal to the architecture lover out there. There are no great techniques nor style explored- the way an Errol Morris or Ken Burns documentary is manifestly theirs. Thus, this film is recommended only for Allen fans who desire to have the man's whole oeuvre- as director, writer, actor, or what not. And, yes, I am one of those people. But, for the rest of you, go watch Another Woman or Stardust Memories. Trust me on that!",1282694400,2,3700,4.737169517884914
8210426,4,B000TR5QB2,"Wild Man Blues is a documentary about Woody Allen and his Dixieland jazz band. They play at a club in New York every Monday, but someone got the bright idea to do a European tour, and make a documentary about it!?!?! Whoever that was, was brilliant; I can say without the slightest trace of irony.

-----------------
Woody Allen: With intelligence comes great responsibility.
===========

European audiences love all of his films, not just the ones that are popular here in the U.S. Throughout his European Tour he was besieged by fans, and they came to the concerts to see the comedian, the auteur, but they politely listened to his music. They enjoyed the music. Many thought that he played better than they expected. He loved the music, and his sincerity won them over.

-----------------
Woody Allen: The Europeans like pictures that drone on, and I'm good at making pictures that drone on.
===========

The band gets to tour Europe and draws large crowds, but the audience is there to see Woody Allen, movie star, comedian, and director. There is some tension with the band. Woody Allen doesn't really talk to them much, except through the banjo player, the band leader. Though the audience might be coming to see Woody, he is just the clarinet player. He would prefer to just play the music, but the audience expects him to say something, so he gives a little introduction before each show. Woody does seem to be at least as good as the rest of the band when it comes to Dixieland jazz, and they are a very good Dixieland jazz band.

-----------------
{On why he likes playing blues} Woody Allen: There's nothing there between you and the pure feeling of playing. There's no cerebral part to it.
===========

At one point Woody needs a new reed or maybe his clarinet needs some work. His sound is dead as a doornail. He even says, hey, my sound is dead as a doornail. He plays a great solo, though. A blues where the dead as a doornail sound works to his advantage. It is uncanny. There is another scene where Woody visits the Selmer clarinet factory. He is playing a metal clarinet, and it sounds fantastic. He wants to buy it, but incredibly, the Selmer people say that it is a rare instrument that they no longer manufacture, and it is not for sale. Not even for Woody.

-----------------
Woody Allen: I'm appropriately animate for a human being in the context in which I exist.
===========

Wild Man Blues shows us that Woody is a cranky old man, constantly kvetching--a hypochondriac, even. He is anything but a wild man, except that he is married to Soon Yi, a much younger woman who is the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow. Besides the man and his music, Wild Man Blues also reveals his relationship with Soon Yi. Maybe you hated Woody Allen over this, or maybe you thought he was a lucky guy, but after watching WMB you just might find yourself feeling sorry for the guy, a poor old man being bossed around by a young dragon lady in training.

-----------------
Woody Allen: This is Soon-Yi Previn, the notorious Soon-Yi Previn.
===========

In a revealing scene Woody tells Soon Yi that even Soon Yi and her chronologically challenged friends would find Annie Hall amusing. She responds that she tried to watch Interiors when she was nine but found it tedious, and her favorite Woody Allen film was Manhattan. She never saw Annie Hall, though she had met Dianne Keaton personally. On a side note, Soon Yi appeared in a Thanksgiving scene in Hannah and Her Sisters.

Near the end there's a scene with Woody and his parents. He gives the awards he has accrued on his European tour to his father, who takes them, but is not overly impressed with any of it. His mother seems friendly enough, but he accuses her of raising him improperly. He accuses her of being a bad mother, never supporting what he was trying to do: sequestering himself in his room, practicing the clarinet, listening to the radio, writing comedy bits. He was preparing himself for a life in show biz, but they probably would have been happier had he opted for a sedate life as a pharmacist. His mother confesses that she was hoping both he and his brother Chris would settle down with nice Jewish girls.

Bottom line is that Wild Man Blues is a rare opportunity to see what Woody Allen is really like, and hear some great music. He's not as funny in person as he is in the movies. Or he is more like Interiors than Annie Hall.

-----------------
Woody Allen: They won't pay ten cents to see one of my movies, but passing in a gondola, they love it.

Top Ten Films of Mia Farrow (with fun facts and trivia courtesy of imdb dot com):

1.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>&nbsp;(1968) Directed by Roman Polanski, whose pregnant wife actress Sharon Tate was murdered in 1969 by Charles Manson and his followers, who titled their death spree ""Helter Skelter"" after the 1968 song by The Beatles, one of whose members, 'John Lennon,' would one day live (and in 1980 be murdered) in the Manhattan apartment building called The Dakota - where Rosemary's Baby had been filmed. The Dakota Building on Manhattan's Upper West Side was renamed The Bramford for the film. It was on the set of this film that Mia Farrow received divorce papers from then-husband Frank Sinatra.

2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Gatsby/dp/B0000AUHQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Gatsby</a>&nbsp;(1974) Originally, Truman Capote was the screenwriter, and his draft included making Nick a homosexual and Jordan Baker a vindictive lesbian. Capote was fired, and Francis Ford Coppola finished his draft in three weeks. Francis Ford Coppola lived in ""West Egg,"" aka Great Neck, former home of F. Scott Fitzgerald, at the time of writing the screenplay for ""The Great Gatsby."" The rights for the novel were purchased by producer Robert Evans in 1971 so that his wife at the time, Ali MacGraw, could play the part of Daisy. A shooting script wasn't ready yet, and MacGraw agreed to star in The Getaway (1972) as filler. During the production of The Getaway (1972) MacGraw fell in love with co-star Steve McQueen and left Evans for him. Mia Farrow was then picked to play Daisy. Mia Farrow was pregnant during filming and the director filmed around that by including close up shots of Farrow, and having her wear a lot of flowing costumes.

3.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Midsummer-Night-s-Sex-Comedy/dp/B00005O06K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy</a>&nbsp;(1982) Woody Allen wrote the role of Ariel for Diane Keaton, but she couldn't take the part because she was busy promoting her film Reds (1981) and preparing for Alan Parker's Shoot the Moon (1982). The first time Woody Allen appeared in one of his own films as part of an ensemble cast. Prior to this, he was either the main character or not in the film at all. The first time Mia Farrow appeared in a Woody Allen film. Woody Allen wrote the screenplay in 2 weeks.

4.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zelig/dp/B00005O06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zelig</a>&nbsp;(1983) To create authenticity, the production used actual lenses, cameras and sound equipment from the 1920s, and used the exact same lighting that would have been done. In addition, 'Gordon Willis' took the exposed negatives to the shower, and stomped on them. In order to help create the look of genuine footage from the 1930s, DuArt, the lab that handled processing, called some of their experienced technicians (who were experienced with processing techniques of the 1930s) out of retirement.

5.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadway-Danny-Rose/dp/B00005O06I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadway Danny Rose</a>&nbsp;(1984) The reason Mia Farrow wears sunglasses most of the film is that Woody Allen did not feel she could pass herself as a tough Italian ""broad"", so he had her wear the sunglasses most of the film to hide her eyes, making her seem more sultry and mysterious. The only time she removes the sunglasses is when her character is supposed to be more vulnerable.

6.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Purple-Rose-of-Cairo/dp/B00005O06L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Purple Rose of Cairo</a>&nbsp;(1985) Woody Allen has said more than once that this is his favorite of the movies he's made. After this film was previewed, word got back to Woody Allen that if he just changed his ending, he could have a big hit. Allen declined, saying that the ending is one of the reasons he made the film. In an interview in Esquire, Woody Allen was asked why he didn't make a happy ending to the film. Allen replied, ""That *was* the happy ending.""

7.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters/dp/B00005O06J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>&nbsp;(1986) Many of Hannah's scenes were filmed in Mia Farrow's actual apartment. Allen said that Farrow once had the eerie experience of turning on the TV to a chance broadcast of the movie thus viewing her own apartment on TV while she was sitting in it. According to USA Today, upon the film's original release, a movement was afoot to try to make Allen's script the first screenplay to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The poem Eliot gives Lee which contains the line ""nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"", is the poem ""somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond"", by e.e. cummings. The book of poems by e.e. cummings is entitled ?Complete Poems 1913 ? 1962?, and the poem ?Somewhere? is on page 366. With a box office gross of over $40 million, this film represented Woody Allen's most financially successful film until Match Point (2005) in 2005. Four of Mia Farrow's real-life children appear in this film. Two appear as Hannah's son and daughter in the movie, while the other two (including Soon-Yi Previn, who Woody Allen would eventually marry in 1997) appear as young guests in the Thanksgiving scenes.

8.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radio-Days/dp/B00005O06M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radio Days</a>&nbsp;(1987) This is the only Woody Allen film in which both of his frequent collaborators and longtime companions Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton appear.

9.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/September/dp/B00005AUJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">September</a>&nbsp;(1987) Director Woody Allen cast and shot this film twice, without telling the original cast. Woody Allen decided to make the film for two main reasons. One was because he had always wanted to do a ""chamber piece"", a film with a small cast (there are only six principal characters, and only nine in the entire film) in a single location. The other was for the location itself, Mia Farrow's Connecticut country house, which inspired Woody Allen to write the screenplay with the intention that it would be shot at the house. Unfortunately, by the time Allen finished the screenplay, it was winter and the location was unusable for a movie so firmly planted in September. The entire movie (which takes place in Vermont) was shot on a single soundstage at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. According to Mia Farrow's autobiography ""What Falls Away"", Woody Allen filmed two or three versions of every scene, took all of the footage into the editing suite, cut the film together and then decided that he hated it. He then rewrote the entire script, fired and recast virtually every major part, and re-filmed the entire thing. This meant that he doubled his production costs and came in well behind schedule. Allen was reportedly keen to do it all again

10.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Husbands-and-Wives/dp/B000062XE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Husbands and Wives</a>&nbsp;(1992) Hoping to piggyback on the scandal surrounding Woody Allen's break-up with Mia Farrow, TriStar opened the film on 865 screens, the largest amount ever given over to a Woody Allen picture. They were rewarded with an opening weekend of $3.52 million, the biggest ever for an Allen film. Woody Allen said in an interview that the reason he shot the film the way he did was that he wanted to break the usual rules of filmmaking. He cut scenes right in the middle of dialog, he used hand held cameras for no particular reason and did not care if he showed the side or the back of a performer's head during a scene. Allen said for this reason, he felt this film was one of his best. Sydney Pollack stated that although he liked working on the film, he did not like the character he played. Contrary to general perception, Mia Farrow's role is not autobiographical. Indeed, Woody Allen originally wrote the Judy Davis part with the idea of Farrow playing it. Farrow chose to take on the role of Gabe's wife instead as it meant less shooting time for her.

Woody Allen goes to the confessional and says ""Father, I have sinned. I am an elderly man, and yet, every night I am making love to a woman one third my age.""

8210428,4,B000TR5QB2,"If you're a fan of both New Orleans jazz and/or the movies of Woody Allen, Wild Man Blues is a must buy.  This documentary is interesting in that it gives us a glimpse into Woody in an unfamiliar setting.  Here, Woody abandoned his beloved Manhattan for Europe.  Also, his focus here is on playing traditional jazz (as opposed to the psychoanalysis, self-doubt, and relationships with women found in most of his movies).

The more things change, however, the more they stay the same.  As we watch Woody trot across Europe with his band, we see the line between Woody Allen the clarinetist and the protagonists in his movies blur before our very eyes.  All of the doubts, fears, guilt, wit, and desire of his characters display themselves here in many subtle and not-so-subtle ways.  Woody the musician is essentially the same character as Alvie Singer (Annie Hall), Isaac Davis (Manhattan), and Mickey Sachs (Hannah and her Sisters), and the other memorable characters from Woody's classic films.

From a musical standpoint, the film is interesting in its unevenness.  Woody's usually-no-better-than-average clarinet playing is juxtaposed with outstanding playing by some of NYC's best jazz musicians. (Cynthia Sayer, Eddy Davis, John Gill, etc.) This juxtaposition leads to performances by the band that go from weak (Paris) to spotty (Spain) to brilliant (London).  The uneven nature of the musical performances leads Woody to make many hilarious comments that would make his best protagonists proud.

I would recommend this movie to any of the countless fans of Woody's movies.  Watching Wild Man Blues will amplify, augment, and deepen one's understanding and appreciation of those classic Allen protagonists.  Once you watch it, you'll probably want to pop in your Annie Hall DVD immediately.  Even if (like me) you've seen it many times before, you'll have a whole new perspective on that great movie after you've seen Wild Man Blues.",1215648000,16,1940,5.156549520766773
8210429,4,B000TR5QB2,"I'm not a Woody Allen guy. I've only seen one of his movies, and although I enjoyed it, I wasn't hooked. Then came Wild Man Blues, a documentary about Woody's private side on a blues tour throughout Europe. Allen, who is a superb clarinet player, charms us with his fast-firing wit and keeps us rocking as he and his New Orleans Jazz band tickle our musical funny bones in one European country after another.

A very funny film that shows just how Allen is truly a comedic genius, be it in his films or in reality.",1213574400,7,514,4.354166666666667
8210430,5,B000TR5QB2,"I LOVE this documentary of Woody Allen's tour as a Clarinetist with his small band through Europe. To see him as a musician is a delight (especially if you have a heart for Dixieland tunes) but what makes it precious are all the glimpses ""behind"" the scenes and just to be able to accompany him visually on his journey. You'll get a good idea of the human being called Woody Allen who just can't stop cracking jokes even when it's more than obvious than he's not enjoying all of the aspects of his journey himself - and the scene with his parents in the end is the highlight of all...more won't be said! Go and watch this if you are a Woody Allen fan like me! You certainly won't be disappointed!",1210204800,9,696,4.320610687022901
