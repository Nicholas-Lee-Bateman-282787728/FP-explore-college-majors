939371,2,6304917317,"This anime series for me seemed to start off on a bad note.  Every second that passed all I could think of was how horrible this show was compared to The Slayers.  I watched the full tape and just couldn't get into it.  Good  anime shows distort your sense of time and make you think the video you  just watched only took 10 mintues to watch.  This video made me think about  what else I could be doing.  The show did have its strong points.  However,  I just couldn't get into liking the main character in a story.  Which is a  very big requirment to me.  The main character seemed to be even more  irritating then Akane Tendou.  And Akane is a very, very, hard person to  surpass.  The secondary character was extremely annoying.  A little perfect  goody-goody airhead.
The only reason that this film didn't get a 1 star  from me was the dog that appeared that tried to eat off the secondary  characters hand.  Now maybe if this had gone more the slapstick comedy  route it would have worked.  But it combined into something trying to be  serious and funny at the same time.  This can be successful such is the  case for: The Slayers, Ranma 1/2, Birdy, Phantom Quest, and Blue Seed.  But  here it tried to combine to many different elements into one story.
My  personal recomendation on this movie is that I think some will like it and  I think most will not. I have nothing aganist serious Anime, but when it  tries to be so many different things all at the same time it just looses  any charm.  Don't pick this movie up.  Go for The Slayers if you like the  sorcery anime.  And if you're done with The Slayers this is not the place  to look for a replacement.",947894400,4,1663,4.313725490196078
939461,4,6304917317,"This dvd have an adventure that started out as a comedy and then turn into more of a drama toward the end. It even cause me to tears up about what happened at the end - the true story of the remaining characters. I was a bit disappointed when I found out that Ruin Explorer, which advertisted heavily on the earlier ADV dvds were a short story but this made more than use up for it! I gave it only a four star because there are not a lot of reference material in this short sequel like what the heck is specific kind of magic? and how is it releated to the other specific kinds of magic. There is more examples but I don't want to spoil the surprise!  Also I would have liked to know what of the curse on the main character - did she accepted it or went back to her mentor to resolve it?",1202256000,,787,3.981012658227848
939462,4,6304917317,"O.K., here's the story: it's set in a fantasy world where adventurers go exploring ruins searching for treasure and any magical items they can find. If this sounds like any D&D game you played, don't let that throw you off. This has enough action and comedy to satisfy most. I mean, it's not DRAGON HALF, but then few shows are.
Our protagonist is Ihrie, a tomboyish sword fighter who due to a curse inflicted on her years ago is unable to use magic, at least not without a price. (You find out exactly what the curse is in episode 2. Let's just say it's simular to Ranma Soutome's.) To make up for this short coming, she brings with her Fam, a ditzy wiggen (half human, half cat creature) who draws her power from the spirits but often blunders in all things, including magic preforming. They are on a quest for the fabeled Ultimate Power, which could supposedly grant the lucky finder whatever s/he desiers. Ihrie and Fam soon run into another team of ruin explorers-Ragna, another sorceress who has a secret phobia of mice, and her arrogant swordsman partner, who start off as rivals but eventually form an uneasy alliance with our heroines. They are joined by a slimey merchant/con artist, and Lyle, a former prince whose kingdom was wiped out by an evil wizard and who has embarked on a quest for revenge.
The only thing that knocks this down by one star is the ending. Read no further if you hate spoilers. Well, lets just say that I thought Ihrie was supposed to be the main hero, but in the final battle she ultimately didn't seem to really do anything useful, despite her efforts. Also, I wasn't really clear exactly on whether she ever got her curse removed or not.
Anyway, this one is highly recommended.",1084147200,8,1715,4.571428571428571
939463,4,6304917317,"Ruin Explores is a very short, 2 hour long, 4-part series that contains everything necessary for a great story.  All of the characters are basic, but well developed for the story-line.  Nothing is missing, no questions unanswered.
The story goes as this, six companions are in search of the Great-Power, all for their own reasons.  Selfish, greedy, personal or for a kingdom.  All of the reasons are described in some way or another.  I don't want to give anything away.  Then comes the ""bad-guy"", with reasons of his own.  A big fight and then the end.
This anime is the reason why animes are fun.  It contains a great story that could never really be done with real people, or atleast as fun, well developed characters, Fast-paced as far as anime is concerned, good animation, very good English-Dub for us non-Japanese speaking people, and good sound.
Not a lot of extras, but this doesn't really matter to me.
The only complaint is the ending, it feels as if this series could go on, the further adventures of the Ruin Explorers.

939464,5,6304917317,"Isn't it amazing how an anime can be so similar to the Slayers series, yet still be so completely different hurts?  With such crazy antics and super deformed modes from Dragonhalf, this anime can prove to be an hour ((or more)) of sheer delight or extreme boredom ((to those of us with lives and no sense of humour)).  Ruin Explorers is a cheerful combination of The Slayers, Dragonhalf, and somewhat like the Record of LoDoss War.  Anyone who likes decent halfwitted anime comedies about a tom-boy sorceres who turns into a cute little mouse will absolutely adore this anime.  Cheers!",1009497600,5,585,4.82
939465,4,6304917317,"Ruin Explorers, a.k.a. Fam & Ihrie, is the story of two adventurers pillaging the ruins of an ancient civilization for the ""Ultimate Power"". Though this could easily be bad from the start, the slapstick humor and goofy characters are surprisingly entertaining. The 4 episode series only begins to falter when the heroines and their rivals get caught up in someone else's quest for the Ultimate Power. Unlike Nadia where there is plenty of time to explore the Nautilus' goal and how the main characters fit into it, the shift of focus is too quick and just doesn't come off right. The music, performed by the Versailles Chamber Orchestra, is above average. The English dub is quality stuff; Jessica Calvello's Fam is superb. The Japanese track is equally as enjoyable and both audio tracks are Dolby Digital 2 channel. The menus are pleasant to look at and browse. A small cell gallery is included as an extra. The strength of the duo of Fam and Ihrie really outshines this 4 episode OAV series, and would be great material for a TV show. I give this disk 4 stars for the strength of the first few episodes and the quality DVD. For a fantasy fan there is a lot to like about Fam and Ihrie, others may find the story not quite enough.",1008720000,4,1232,4.579185520361991
939466,4,6304917317,"...Though short, this series was far from lacking a good storyline or character development.  In fact, this series houses two of my all-time favorite anime characters: Fam and Lyle.  And though this will never be my favorite anime series, it will certainly always rank pretty high on my charts.  This was a joy to watch, and I've seen this series many times over.  It had an endearing, bittersweet story, plenty of action, romance, and even a few comical moments.  And the animation isn't anything to be sneezed at, either!  And for you bishonen lovers out there, check out Lyle!  With a well though-out and drawn-out plot, with interesting characters and cool animation to boot....",994723200,3,682,4.9298245614035086
939467,2,6304917317,"Is there anything good to say about this anime?  Well... I can't think of anything right now.  All the characters were very flat and two-dimensional.  The story was choppy, the dialogue was dull, and the animation was mediocre at best.  I think this anime was supposed to be humorous, but it even fails at that.  I am a fan of this genre of anime, but I would strongly recommend against anyone adding this particular title to his or her collection.",993859200,,448,4.55
939468,5,6304917317,"This is one great show! It's not a movie (I thought it was). It's a short OAV -- it has 4 episodes. The quality of the artwork is awesome. I really like the dubbing. It's really good. The fighting scenes are cool, and the magic spells are amazing to look at. Since the length of ""Ruin Explorers"" isn't that long, the story don't have much depth. But that doesn't matter, it's a great show to watch. You won't get bored watching this. It's pretty funny at times too!",984441600,3,465,4.295454545454546
939469,4,6304917317,"If you're looking for a laugh, if you're looking to cry, if you're juss looking for some highly framed animation, then this mini series is for you.  It has a deep plot and while at that, the humor isn't left out.  This is the type of anime youd watch over and over. The one thing this DVD is missing, is more characters.  More is better, specially in anime.  But that's not biggie.  This quality movie replaces the flaw.  It has a more than average ""extras"" section compared to most otehr anime DVD's.  A must have for anyone trying to add to their anime library.",983318400,2,563,4.355769230769231
939470,3,6304917317,"Here we have your standard fantasy treasure hunt, complete with cat-girl and spunky herioine. The animation is pretty good, the visuals bright, and the slapstick blah. The main problem with it is that there is nothing in it I hadn't seen before. The characters are borrowed from series such as The Slayers, the magic is no more impressive than, say, Lodoss War, and the plot is right out of a hack fantasy novel. If it took all of the standard elements and tried to do something new and interesting with them, I'd rate it higher, but overall, this is an example of a decently done anime title that seems eerily familiar.",981244800,2,620,4.594594594594595
7879360,5,6304917317,"A great movie, I would say appropriate for audiences that you normally allow to watch a PG-13 movie (I watched it with my 9 and 11 year old children). Swearing, and some romantic discussion, but no nudity or sex. Violence of a level appropriate to a fantasy adventure, but not excessive or gory. Less a series, and more of a movie split into 4 parts. An excellent story, with great character development and acting. I would love to see more stories from this world.",1506729600,,465,4.5476190476190474

7879364,5,6304917317,"I started watching anime with Akira, so I'm not an old school fan of anime, so I'm coming to this review as a fan of many works from the 1990's.  Anyway, Ruin Explorers is compared to a lot of shows, but ultimately this is an OAV so the scope is not going to be as amazing as Slayers for instance.  On the other hand, being an OAV it had a lot of attention paid to solid animation and it has a nice story line to it, that is short but enjoyable.  The two main characters are lovable but certainly full of comic relief in their own right, and they do a good job to keep the show interesting.  At the end of the day, if you're looking to check out something new, or rather a little old in this case, I don't think you can go wrong with picking this up.  The DVD version (I originally watched it on VHS) is crisp, and to me, I honestly see it as a classic.  I hope you enjoy it!",1334102400,,875,3.9152542372881354
7879365,5,6304917317,This is a great forgotten fantasy story similar to Slayers or Rune Soldier. My only complaint is that I wish there were more. I love this show. What's even better was that I was ready to pay $20 to $30 for it but I got it cheaper than any of my other anime to date. It cost me $3 with shipping.,1294876800,,294,3.8360655737704916

7879367,4,6304917317,"I've wanted to watch this anime ever since reading a review at [...] The anime follows the lead characters, Fam, a slightly naive cat-girl wiccan who uses spirits to perform magic, and Ihrie, a sorcerer who has to use a sword most of the time for a rather humorous reason, as they search for ""The Ultimate Power,"" a magic that enables the user to do anything.  Along the way, they run into Lyle, a prince who has lost his kingdom, Miguel, a swordsman who is both amazingly powerful and tremendously stupid, Rasha, a sorceress who is relatively talented but quite vain, and Galuff, a merchant who will stab his comrades in the back if it gives him a bigger cut. The group is threatened by Ruguduroll, a wizard who destroyed Lyle's kingdom.

The anime is a nice treat for fantasy fans and has characters that I honestly found quite likable and a plot that moves with a good pace.  Because of its length, don't expect the deepest characterizations and there is a love triangle that is pointless but the plot and what you do see of the characters is fun enough to make up for this.  If you want a nice, cute, fun series that has enough tension and action to entertain young viewers or if you don't want to commit to a long expensive series like ""Slayers,"" this is the perfect show to add to your collection.",1258848000,,1303,4.46218487394958
7879368,5,6304917317,"This is an underappreciated gem-Fam and Ihrie are 2 Ruin Hunters looking for treasure in abandoned ruins (get it?-hince the title), it's only 6 episodes but packs a lot into them-the story has a few problems and the characters are very well realized. This version has remastered video and audio in 5.1 ac3 which really adds to the enjoyment. Very well done.",1231372800,,357,4.774193548387097
7879369,5,6304917317,"In fact, I'll go one further and say that in this viewer's opinion, it's the very best one out there. I am a born sucker for fantasy anime and have watched a great many in my time. Slayers, Dragon Half, Rune Soldier, Record of Lodoss War, Legend of Crystania, Sorcerer Hunters, Gokudo... all of these are amazing shows in their own right, and all contribute something unique to the genre. So what makes this 4-episode OVA so special? In a nutshell, Ruin Explorers distills the very best of what fantasy anime has to offer into an extremely memorable production with no apparent flaws.

The characters of Ruin Explorers are easily one of its best selling points. Ihrie, a warrior/magician with a short fuse and a serious handicap in the shape of a curse, is my favorite character from this show, and one of my favorite anime characters, period. Many others express a preference for her ditzy magician partner, Fam, or the determined prince, Lyle, which is very understandable. Rasha and Miguel are also very fun, reminiscient of Nagha (Slayers) and Louie (Rune Soldier); and the greedy merchant Galuff and his Muttley-lookalike dog Gil are great, too. On a darker note, Ruguderall is a heckuva villian who is just as bad as he looks. This entire crew was brought to life through exceptional performances by the dub and sub actors alike and through great work by the animators.

One of the key strengths of this cast is how very UN-heroic they are for the most part, especially starting out. Having goofy or slightly selfish fantasy characters is certainly nothing new, but rarely do you see characters who are at once so likeable and yet so TOTALLY in it for the money, riches, and power! Fam and Ihrie are basically glorified temple-robbers, the same goes for Miguel and Rasha, and Galuff's greed needs little commentary. What keeps these people so endearing despite their mercenary motives is the personal loyalty that they exhibit toward one another. Above all else, Ruin Explorers is a show about friendship and how far these characters will go to help one another. It's that nobler aspect of their personalities that eventually helps them to end the show as true heroes.

The short length (4 episodes) of this anime has been alternately accepted or grumbled about, but I view it as another strength. Time and time again, I am amazed at how ""tight"" and entertaining a story Ruin Explorers manages to present in such a short space. When you have time to waste, you often will--this anime's time was at a premium, so it takes advantage of every single second to develop character and plot at a pace that is always fast-moving but that almost never seems rushed. As with other, similarly short shows (such as FLCL), this thing's brevity also carries the benefit of not giving its creators time to screw up. You can't afford a bad or ""slow"" episode when you only have four to work with.

Let's see, what else? The animation quality is high overall; not the very best out there, but quite well-done considering its age (roughly Lodoss War quality). The music is appropriate throughout, and the main vocal theme, ""Magical Beat,"" is really good. If you were to force me at gunpoint to name a flaw for Ruin Explorers, it would be that it's not terribly innovative--the kinds of fantasy characters you see here are well-established ""types""; same goes for the plot. Again, though, rarely has that ""standard fare"" tasted so darn good. :)

Overall, I can't recommend Ruin Explorers enough, especially to fans of the fantasy genre. You will have to look very far to find two hours and $10-25 dollars better spent.",1228521600,,3603,4.79549114331723
