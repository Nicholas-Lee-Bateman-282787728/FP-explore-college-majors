I have been wondering what they are, but she never explained until I saw this video!  One thing that amazed me, even at being over the age of ten, was that segment with the punch and the water.  The first time I saw it, my mouth dropped open so much, my jaw almost hit the floor!  lol.  And, I love the shadow puppet sequence she does with Lamb Chop, and her animal noises.  The songs are wonderful, and the humour is just as awesome!  Totally recommend this video to add to your Shari Lewis collection!",1315612800,,657,4.241935483870968
