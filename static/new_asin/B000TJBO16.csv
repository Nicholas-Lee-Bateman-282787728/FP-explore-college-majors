""Brooklyn Rules"" is a ho-hum ""Goodfellas"" knock-off about three lifelong buddies (Freddie Prinze Jr., Scott Caan and Jerry Ferrara) and their involvement with the mafia.  After a brief prologue set in 1974, the film moves quickly ahead to 1985, where Mikey, Carmine and Bobby, now in their 20's, are attempting to make their way in a world where a mob boss by the name of Caesar Manganaro (Alec Baldwin) rules the streets with an iron fist.  Mikey, the film's narrator, is the one most torn between loyalty to the neighborhood and his pals and a desire to experience life beyond this old familiar corner of Brooklyn. Carmine is the hard-nosed tough guy who wants nothing more than to be a card-carrying member of the Manganaro clan.

Written by Terence Winter and directed by Michael Corrente, the film indulges in just about every mob-movie clich one could possibly imagine, topped off by corny narration and banal wise-guy dialogue done in barely comprehensible dese-dem-dose accents.  The movie earns a few points for at least trying to create a morally complex character in Mikey (though heavily borrowed from Michael Corleone), but the cliched storytelling, lackluster performances and dull writing rob the film of most of its impact.  There's a decided lack of energy and urgency in the direction as well, making ""Brooklyn Rules"" a very minor addition to the mob movie genre indeed.",1204416000,9,1395,5.017316017316017
2903627,5,B000TJBO16,"Though I won't  do a recap as previous reviewers have already done so, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that especially appeals to fans of the crime genre.  Terrence Winter has done fantastic work in the Sopranos writing many of the best episodes throughout the seasons that include ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""Army of One,""  and ""Unidentified Black Males"" to name a few.  Fans of the Sopranos will fall in love again with the style of dialogue- a masterful balance that examines the meaning of tragedy, betrayal, and friendship.  The direction is compelling and the different pieces of the cinematography, score, acting, and script blend beautifully.  I suggest buy the dvd, tell your friends, as this may become the next american gangster cult classic.

2903629,5,B000TJBO16,"After watching Sopranos, The Shield and Six Feet Under, I was in a quandary about what to watch. Frequently, I make my trip to the video store only to return that same movie unviewed completely because it was so bad...But, not this movie. I wasn't disappointed at the payoff. This film had a broader message than simply being a mob story, it was about friendship, love and commitment. I really loved the film and I am a female if that makes any difference.",1191110400,,456,4.506024096385542
2903630,4,B000TJBO16,"This story starts off with three young boys in a Brooklyn church in 1974. The three friends; Carmine, Michael, and Bobby are played by Scott Caan, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jerry ""Turtle"" Ferrara. At the 3 minute mark Alec Baldwin enters the movie, and immediately beats up a guy, and throws him down the stairs. Later on he is introduced as Caesar, a captain in the Gambino Family. Alec's performance is  top notch in this movie, as one minute he comes across as a ferocious murdering  grizzly bear, and the next minute, he's as warm and protecting as a loving big brother. Before the boys even reach their teens they become immune to the violence and crime filled neighborhood they live in. One day on the way home they come upon a car on the shore with a ""wacked"" man in the front seat. One  boy takes the dead man's cigarette lighter, one boy takes a gun out of the glove compartment, and one boy takes a puppy. No further comment is made about the situation.

The movie then fast forwards to 1985, with Michael attending Columbia University, Bobby going nowhere fast, but thinking about taking the Postal exam, and Carmine trying to buddy up to the Mafia, and pulling off a few ""strong-arm""  jobs. This story really isn't a ""Mafia movie"", but the Mafia is always lurking on  the periphery. There are a number of good quotes that epitomize the ""flavor"" of Brooklyn: ""You invent a better mousetrap here, you get a mousetrap stuck up you're a**!"" ""There's a big difference between fear and respect!""

This movie is really about a coming of age of three lifetime buddies in Brooklyn. Being that my family is originally from Brooklyn, I can state un-categorically, that the director of this movie has the accents and mannerisms  and swagger down pat!",1190851200,6,1747,4.64935064935065
2903631,5,B000TJBO16,An amazing piece of filmaking and a must see.  The performance of a lifetime for all three main actors.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD,1190246400,4,141,4.185185185185185
2903632,5,B000TJBO16,"I was completely blown-away by ""Brooklyn Rules,"" which is an Oscar caliber, skillful blending of a solid character drama with an in-your-face mob-actioner.  Purportedly inspired by real life circumstances for writer Terry Winter (of the ""Sopranos"" fame), one can only hope that Mr. Winter fictionalized at least portions of it, or hope that the statute of limitations on prior bad acts has since expired.  While audiences can always expect a solid performance from Alec Baldwin, I was especially impressed with the acting of Freddie Prinze, Jr., whose previous work in films such as ""Scoobie-Doo"" did not suggest the level of intensity, conflict and color that he shows throughout ""BROOKLYN RULES.""  Tech credits -- from music to cinematography -- are tops, making this film one of the best indie films in years, perhaps of all time.  This is a must-buy collectible movie, that merits repeat viewings, with new dimensions revealed each time.  Director Michael Corrente is one of the best in the industry, and ""BROOKLYN RULES"" proves it beyond any doubt.",1187654400,11,1053,5.170588235294118
2903633,5,B000TJBO16,"""Brooklyn Rules,"" written by Sopranos' writer Terrence Winter, and directed by Michael Corrente, is a masterpiece in it's own right. Semi-based on the true life story of three friends from Brooklyn, NY, this picture shows the world the true meaning of friendship, struggle, and love that is almost untouchable by any other movie I have ever seen. It is brilliantly written and acted out. The stars, Scott Caan, Freddie Prince, Jr., and Jerry Ferrara capture the true culture of Brooklyn and what it means to be from the neighborhood. The supporting cast is AMAZING (Chris Caldovino's portrayal of Philly Cabrese is GREAT)! Everyone MUST see ""Brooklyn Rules"".",1186704000,7,658,5.158878504672897
2903634,4,B000TJBO16,What a movie! It is like a Bronx Tale meets Stand By Me. A Romeo & Juliet/West Side Story combo. From The streets of Brooklyn to the streets of Manhattan. Three friends follow their dream. One follows the path of the street; the wannabe gangster. Another follows the path of the streets via college. And one lost soul is just happy to be the blue collar regular guy. A love story; a story about friendship and loyalty. Freddie Prinze Jr. is fantastic; as is Mena Suvari. Scott Caan reminds us so much of his father in this role. Jerry Ferrara's break out big screen role. Michael Corrente outdid himself with this masterpiece. He has Alec Baldwin back in another good role. And check out the non-speaking doorman; his expressions are priceless. A must see film!,1166745600,9,761,4.644444444444445

Instead , it is a story about how working-class people have to face real life and can get drawn into things that are involuntary.  The story never ""goes  Hollywood""  where the characters are expendable  and care nothing about life. Gangs are part of the movie ; but it's about people. I say it's a really good movie, perhaps a bit on the exaggerated side ; but  not offensively fictional.  When I saw so many  Catholic symbols I figured it would come at Christ with a machete; but it refrained for some reason. It's entertaining and worth your time.",1370649600,,638,4.592920353982301

2903679,4,B000TJBO16,"I enjoyed this movie because of it's very unique approach.
It's a buddy flick, because the main characters (3 italian kids)
have been friends since childhood running in the mean streets
of Brooklyn in the 70's. As they grow up into young men
in the mid 80's, one, Mikey (Freddie Prinze Jr.), pursues
college life with hopes of someday getting out of the
neighborhood and seeing the wider world, but he still remains
loyal to his buds and his upbringing as well.
Another, Carmine (Scott Caan), who is the stereotypical cocky,
extremely vain, bravado-ladened ""Guido"" who we all know
and love with aspirations for the mob life he witnesses & admires
from his childhood idol, a mobster named Ceasar, played well
by Alec Baldwin. The other friend is Bobby (Jerry Ferrara),
who isn't that bright, but he has a heart of gold and is
often the buffer between the other two stronger personalities
of Mikey and Carmine.
This is where the coming-of-age story and the mob flick merge.
As anybody who follows mob history on A&E or The Bio Channel knows,
the mid 80's were a very very volatile time in NYC Mob History
with the vicious mob wars, takeovers and rises to power
of people like John Gotti, etc.
As the guys go about they're lives, they are invitably drawn in
and sucked up into this world because of their friend
Carmine's affiliations. Without giving too much of the story away,
some calamity and tragedy happens in the life of the friends
as well as the neighborhood which changes all parties concerned
to their foundations. The guys have to grow up real quick
and make some serious life choices which will either make
or break them, to become the men that they wish to be!
A story of great comraderie, loyalties, the love of true freinds
and making some life-altering choices.
Very well written and executed by the ensemble cast of both
widely known and local New York theatre actors,
and directed with great care by Michael Corrente,
one of the true life friends that this story was based on.
It's entertaining and worth 4 stars in my book!",1238025600,,2040,4.669444444444444
2903680,5,B000TJBO16,"When you look at the cast of this film, it's hard to believe how little media exposure it received. I hadn't heard of it until I saw it on the Vine newsletter, and I'm a fan of Prinze Jr. and Alec Baldwin's so I thought I would give it a go. The additional cast of Jay Ferrara and Scott Caan would only make this film more enjoyable and enthralling.

The story is set around 3 very close friends. Bobby (The Sweetheart), Carmine (The Vain One) and Michael (The Smart One). One day after skipping church as kids, they discover the body of a man who has been executed in a mob hit. They look around the scene, Carmine kept a lighter and a pack of cigarettes he found, Michael kept the gun he found and Bobby kept a puppy he found. These objects were the representative objects of what these children are to be like in their adult lives.

Fast forward to the mid 80s and the boys have all grown up. Michael (Prinze Jr.) is in college and looking to become a lawyer, Bobby (Jay Ferrara) is looking to marry his girlfriend of two years, and just keeping out of trouble and Carmine (Scott Caan) has become involved in the mob. This is where the boys start to clash on many things, whilst still remaining very close to each other. Michael wants to improve his life by going to college whilst Carmine seems to like the tough guy attitude that comes with being involved with the mob and is staying put. Bobby, well Bobby is just the joke of the group. Still the sweet guy who has good intentions all round. These changes in personality lead to a lot of trouble brewing around the trio, which eventually draws them all into it. This is mainly focused around Carmines massive admiration for mob king Caesar (Alec Baldwin) and a little scuffle they get in at a restaurant one night.

There was quite a bit wrong with this film, but it was all cancelled out by the utterly fantastic acting by the majority involved. Let's get the bad things out of the way first so we can discuss the greatness of the acting front men. Seeing as this was set in the mid 1980s, it was a wholly unconvincing setting as apart from the odd 80s car and the odd person in stereotypical 80s gear, it just didn't feel like the 80s. Also the relationship between Michael and his love interest, Ellen (Mena Suvari) was the most unconvincing thing I've ever seen on screen, and I've seen Godzilla. In fact the chemistry between the two was so non-existent, I found myself becoming exhausted by the two being on screen.

Now the acting is something truly superb and really made this movie worthy of my time and effort. The accents weren't brilliant and at times I felt like they were a bit too exaggerated, I know it's set in Brooklyn and the characters are Italian American but I just found myself not fully buying into the accents. The film felt like a compilation of all the decent emotional bits from my favourite mob movies; but the way it was done is by no means a bad thing. The intimidating and awesome rare appearances by Alec Baldwins character just reminded me why I was still watching this film. It's a mob movie without the over the top offensive language or the extreme violence. It still depicts that but in a more casual way without it being labelled as self censorship.

It's overall a good and enjoyable film, the friendship of the three is actually quite loveable and you can relate to the friendship they have by friendships you have in the way you would lovingly mock your best friend or become over protective of them if they're attacked by an outsider. The best parts of the movie are Prinze Jr. And Baldwin, without them, I doubt this film would be just as good.",1237852800,2,3644,4.432835820895522
2903681,3,B000TJBO16,"This comes from one of the writers of 'The Sopranos,' and it shows. There are real quality lines & a lot of things we've seen before. The performances lift it a little, though, as they are the strongest thing here.

Alec Baldwin follows his great turn in 'The Departed' with another strong turn. This is pretty good entertainment, nothing great.

2903682,3,B000TJBO16,"This run-of-the-mill mob-wars centred movie is about as formulaic and predictable as it possible to be without actually being a complete copy of something else. ""Brooklyn Rules"" uses a standard mix of foul language, NY American-Italian patois, stock shock scenes of gratuitous violence, tacky casual sex scenes and formulaic black humour to re-tell every other coming-of-age-in-Brooklyn/escape-versus-stay-true-to-your-roots tale that has ever been told. Even its setting in the 1980s feels like nothing more that a cheap trick to make the production appeal to those of an age to be nostalgic for those years.

So, if you have a hankering to be reminded of such things as Cabbage Patch Dolls, Atari computers and assassination attempts on the Pope, and have never seen a mob movie before, this film may just be the ticket. Anyone else, however, will probably feel that they've seen it all before somewhere. And mostly better done.",1216771200,,930,5.283783783783784

writing and directing are great. Just a terrific movie. I wasn't surprised by the killing of one of the friends but it kinda made the movie sad but
