Thank you for the CD version.  It should last a longer time.",1478908800,,208,3.9285714285714284
8147140,5,B000IONF5K,I like this DVD.  Not alot of chit chat like some of them and there is concern that you are lifting with the proper form so as to avoid injury.  I recommend it for those starting out or at any level.,1196208000,5,199,3.8292682926829267
