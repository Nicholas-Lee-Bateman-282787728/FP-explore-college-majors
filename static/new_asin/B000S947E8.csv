8204827,5,B000S947E8,This Canadian series is an absolute must-see! I am showing it to my French students so that they can learn about the diversity in Canada and the dynamics and make up of a Canadian family. I highly recommend this series!!,1321920000,,220,4.525
8204828,5,B000S947E8,"...and maybe about la langue franaise as practiced in Qubec. The version I saw had standard ""Metro"" French subtitles for the Qc. French, on TV5Monde, which I have to admit did vary a lot from the French spoken in the show. I have ordered my dvd now that I know it is out, I don't know whether or what kind of subtitles are available but the show is so funny I have to have it, & my tape is missing. Each episode, Dominique ""explains"" the strange customs of Quebec to another immigrant, framing the show's theme for that ep. It is a gem of human understanding and self-deprecating humor. Too bad there was just one season, but it was golden.",1292630400,,640,4.341666666666667
8204829,5,B000S947E8,"We saw several episodes of this remarkable show recently in Rome, broadcast over a French channel. It was shown with French subtitles, which helped me understand it. (It's not that I am a purist about the language, it's that my comprehension of any form of spoken French is weaker than my ability to understand written French.) I hope this show may soon be broadcast in America with English subtitles, so even those with no French at all can enjoy it! A superficial description makes the series sound like an artificial and ""politically-correct"" concept -- focusing as it does on a family that is maximally racially and culturally mixed -- but in fact it is a natural-feeling and often hilarious human drama.  Beautifully written, it's acted with seemingly effortless finesse.  We fell in love with it.",1196640000,,802,4.933333333333334
