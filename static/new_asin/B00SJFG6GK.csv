I could have done without the narrator's sometimes silly ""pretend"" voicing of some of the animals thoughts, but this was a minor complaint.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the DVD.  I also have a lot of respect for the sanctuary volunteers and got to watch as they explained exactly how they help heal their charges (very interesting).",1433289600,,610,4.716981132075472
