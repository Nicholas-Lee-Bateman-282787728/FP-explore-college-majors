2179243,5,B00069A5E6,MY two year old son loves this cd. I love it for the fact that it is Winnie the Pooh plus the added bonus of teaching friendship and sharing.  Highly recommended for your young ones.,1128902400,6,182,4.2
2179244,5,B00069A5E6,My 1 and 3 year old watch this over and over again.  They enjoy it and the best part is that the dvd will play and start over on it's own.  That means I don't have to mash play every time they want to watch it again and again.,1126051200,10,226,3.5918367346938775

2179246,5,B00069A5E6,"My son and daughter are in their early twenties. They grew up watching the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh on the Disney channel and loved every episode, movie, book, etc. I bought one of these Growing up DVD's for them as a fun Christmas gift and they loved it. They remembered just about every episode they've ever seen in detail, so I have tried to buy as many of these collections as I could find (we now have 5 of 6 that I know of).  I don't think these old cartoons are played any more, which is a shame for this next generation. We all love the Pooh stories. No, they aren't educational in that they don't teach ABCs ( the Pooh friends can't spell - that's what makes it so funny) and they don't teach math (the animals can't really count either - again funny).  But they teach good moral values and how to be a good friend,  which is hard to find these days.  I don't think these shows are for toddlers, who wouldn't understand the social interactions and nuances anyway.  Thank you A.A. Milne and Disney for giving my kids (and me) these wonderful little friends to enjoy and share with their families some day.",1423094400,2,1122,4.349282296650718
2179247,5,B00069A5E6,I grew up watching this cartoon on Saturday mornings. I'm glad that I can buy some of the episodes on these dvds. I have always liked winnie the pooh and probably will continue to like it.,1369353600,,188,4.25
2179248,5,B00069A5E6,My 3.5 year old loves this Winnie the Pooh video. It's a great addition to our childs large video collection.,1365897600,,109,4.5
2179249,5,B00069A5E6,Packaging like new and the disk was also. We love Pooh and this one just help complete the collection. Will purchase from you again. B,1361750400,,134,4.4
2179250,5,B00069A5E6,"Nothing in this video to worry a young one but has a good lesson included in it.
Who doesn't remember and love the Winnie the Pooh series?  Silly Old Bear!!!",1355097600,,157,4.233333333333333
2179251,3,B00069A5E6,I didn't like the used dvd because it froze up alot. My 2 year old twins cried everytime it froze up.,1345334400,,101,3.857142857142857
2179252,5,B00069A5E6,"I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it! I didn't think that it was a bad price for 4 episodes of winnie the pooh. The only disapointing thing I found was that it does not have the orginal theme song, but over all its a really really good deal and very cute!",1328918400,,266,3.9444444444444446
2179253,5,B00069A5E6,"I was very pleased with the condition of this DVD.  Very happy with the purchase, it plays great.  Thank you!",1276300800,,109,4.4
2179254,2,B00069A5E6,The video is very cute about how to treat friends.  I bought for my four year old grandson but my eight year old grandson enjoys too.,1264982400,,133,4.115384615384615
2179255,5,B00069A5E6,"My preschooler has loved Winnie the Pooh since she was a baby, and I've been collecting the Pooh DVDs, not just the full-length movies, but also the Growing Up with Winnie the Pooh series. The animation is vibrant and the stories all have wonderful messages about friendship and loyalty. In ""Friends Forever"", there are four episodes: ""Goodbye Mr Pooh!"" has Pooh changing goodbyes into happy returns, in ""Where Oh Where Has My Piglet Gone"", Pooh frantically searches for Piglet, in ""Fish Out of Water"", something fishy seems to be going on when fish fall from the sky and Eeyore finds himself airborne, and in ""Pooh Skies"" , Pooh is concerned that he's damaged the sky.

There really is nothing to offend in these stories - the language is clean and the themes conveyed are universal. A perfect series for young children.",1249171200,9,821,4.822695035460993

8040572,2,B00069A5E6,"I'm really not so much a fan of this one. It's so hard to get the good Pooh films/episodes if you don't live in the UK, with the international licensing agreements (they won't sell them to you from Britain if you have a U.S. address). And lots of the best ones are now only available on VHS; we have no system in the house that will play VHS. So I have a few long Pooh movies that I really love for my kids, but I was looking for a collection of shorter episodes that would be a more appropriate length for my littlest and not scary or super-action-packed: I like the old episodes you can sometimes view on YouTube. This really wasn't what I was after! The episodes are a little shorter, and they are about ""nice"" principles, but they aren't interesting and are slow-paced (that's coming from a mama who is paranoid of fast-paced for little ones!). They seem to just wander along, sort of disorganized and repetitive and cheesy (and not in a nice engaging way like Pooh himself). I don't think they really hold attention well. They feel aimless, thrown together under the ""Pooh"" name to put something new out on the market. At least there is definitely no questionable material in them. And that is definitely worth something!",1489017600,,1226,4.527027027027027
8040573,4,B00069A5E6,Gift for our grandson! Arrived in timely fashion! He was so excited!,1488758400,,68,4.75
8040574,5,B00069A5E6,The cartoon was. Delightful to watch and the Grandchildren were fully involved. This is a wnderful educational tool and very entertaining.,1475884800,,138,5.619047619047619
8040575,5,B00069A5E6,Fun to watch. Kids loved the trout story line.,1472601600,,46,4.222222222222222
8040576,2,B00069A5E6,"We enjoy the classic Pooh stories, and don't mind the Disney 60's adaptation.  But these...these stories are ridiculous nonsense. They're not anything like the clever, fun stories of old!  I know they're just for toddlers, but it almost pains me to expose her to such silly foolishness without even a meaningful moral or message to underpin it. Such a disappointment.",1456876800,,367,5.1
