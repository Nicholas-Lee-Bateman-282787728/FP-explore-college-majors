5362157,4,B009S7JGR4,"I have given these episodes from yesteryear only 4 stars as the sound is clear enough but no attempt has been made to improve picture quality.  I remember the opening sequence featured Jace Pearson (Willard Parker) who incidently appears to start of out of step to the music but quickly corrects his step before being joined by his partner Clay Morgan (Harry Laughter) and other Texas Rangers as he walked towards the camera, the opposite happened prior to the closing credits when again as the rangers walked towards the camera the rangers started to ""peel off"" until Jace Pearson was left alone glancing left and right then at the camera.  However this later closing sequence only appears on 1 episode The Steel Trap.
Having been a fan of this show and not having seen it on tv since the late 50's adding this volume to my ""classic"" collection was a must and I can recommend this to anyone who put this tv classic on thier must watch list way back when.

I don't think this show has been on television since it went off the air in the 1950's.  I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!.  I was expecting to see real bad programs from aging, on the contrary they were good.  I am pleased, thanks Amazon.",1439683200,2,353,4.223880597014926

5362166,3,B009S7JGR4,This series dates back to my childhood and brings back strong memories of coming home from school to watch the Texas Rangers especially the opening credits and tune.

5362167,5,B009S7JGR4,"I am thoroughly enjoying this compilation, which provides a welcome return to the early years of my own childhood - while the images are a mite murky (probably about as they looked on the old b/w set we had at the time), I am impressed with the overall production quality and the moral substance of these programs - can't wait to get more of these if they are available.",1377475200,4,370,4.3768115942028984
