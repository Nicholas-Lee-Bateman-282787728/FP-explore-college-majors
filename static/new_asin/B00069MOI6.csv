2179286,5,B00069MOI6,"My mother, who was a young woman living in England during WW2, frequently discussed this wartime film with me, as one of her personal favorites. She WAS one of those women who worked in the shipyards as a welder when there was a serious shortage of men, who were off fighting the war. The film has always intrigued me but I was unable to view it, not being commercially available until recently. My mother is now deceased but having viewed the film, I can see why she had always regarded it as a classic. It is a film I have repeatedly viewed and I have grown to love it as much as she had.",1404432000,4,590,4.184210526315789

2179292,4,B00069MOI6,"""Millions Like us"" is a low key British film which gives a real feel for the trials and tribulations of the home front in England during World War 2. There is an authenticity which is rare. The film follows the experiences of a cross section of girls who contribute to the war effort by working in a munitions factory.  The film is strongest in its documentary aspects and Patricia Roc, a pretty English favourite of the time, though not much of an actress, is appealing in the simplicity of her role as the shy Celia. The weakest link is the unsubtle acting of Anne Crawford as the rich girl ""who learns her place"" as a working girl.

The supporting cast are outstanding, particularly Megs Jenkins as a practical and warm friend to Celia, Eric Portman as the foreman, though his diction is as unintelligible as ever, and Moore Marriott as Celia's widowed father. A very young Gordon Jackson plays the gauche Scottish airman who marries Celia. The film has one of the most moving endings of any film of the period and typically without histrionics. It may move you to tears.

The print of the film is generally poor but in an odd way, it adds to the authenticity of the film.  There are no extras.",1308182400,4,1197,4.527777777777778
2179293,4,B00069MOI6,"Patricia Roc stars in this quietly powerful British wartime drama, which follows the lives of several young women working in a munitions factory during WW2.  Crafted by the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat (the ""St. Trinian's"" films), 1943's MILLIONS LIKE US was originally intended as a straightforward documentary, however the decision was eventually made to embellish the hours of real footage which had already been shot with a dramatic storyline.

Celia Crowson (Patricia Roc) stuns her entire family when she announces plans to leave home and enlist for war-work.  Joining thousands of other girls at a munitions factory in the countryside, Celia soon becomes a well-regarded member of the team, and later falls in love with young RAF flyer Fred Blake (a boyish, ruddy-faced Gordon Jackson); though as the war in Europe rages on, Celia and Fred's marriage will have tough challenges.

MILLIONS LIKE US had the distinction of being filmed and released during the war itself.  As a result, the overall flavour and feel of the piece is much more authentic and the film, I'm sure, was warmly-embraced by the audiences of the day, who could more than readily relate to the dramas taking place onscreen.  Very little (if nothing) of the story is forced or melodramatic - though the temptation was definitely there - and it's a credit to the filmmakers that this never happened.

Patricia Roc, a favourite of British audiences, is lovely and understated in the lead role of Celia; and Gordon Jackson affectively downplays his shy RAF flyer.  The supporting cast includes familiar faces like Eric Portman, Anne Crawford (as a snooty society girl who eventually proves her mettle in the factory), and the beautifully-stoic Megs Jenkins.  There are some haunting shots throughout the film (planes flying over the darkened Bristol Hippodrome) and also charming scenes with the factory girls (their first night, bunking at the factory hostel, plays like something out of ""Stage Door"").  Highly recommended.",1305244800,6,2008,5.169753086419753
2179294,4,B00069MOI6,"This film was made during the war and like many movies of the time it was meant to increase support for the war effort with the overriding theme of ""everybody doing their part.""

2179301,4,B00069MOI6,"Becoming aware of the world as I did during WWII, the impact of the war on people's lives was ""normal"" to me. But aside from Rosie the Riveter, and for the blacks who found new employment opportunities in the war industries, WWII for Americans was mostly for the young and recently young men, and for the women who had to worry about them (though everybody suffered through the rationing system). The situation in England was more profound, as the early years of the war put the country in a desperate situation, requiring mobilization of a very large fraction of the population. I have always liked English movies of that period, as the sense of a great need for common effort up and down the status ladder nearly always shows through - though of course nearly all movies made during that period were propaganda to a certain extent (as were American movies, and even American soap operas were enlisted in the cause, especially to make factory work acceptable to respectable women). Millions Like Us was certainly propaganda for the cause, but it did not spare the grief. Neither the lower-class nor the upper class working woman achieve their goals (the new husband of the first is killed over Germany, the factory manager the rebuffs the romantic interest of the second), and the factory work is anything but glamorous. So if the movie  was propaganda, it was honest propaganda. The scenes of the huge factory, the workers being treated at mealtimes to wholesome
entertainment and group singing, and the everyday problems of life in wartime feature a gritty realism. It takes seriously troubled times to bring a shared sense of responsibility to a whole people, and Millions Like Us provides a glimpse of a successful social response to such times.",1437609600,3,1750,4.87248322147651

8040643,5,B00069MOI6,"I loved this movie!  The only difficulty with it is having to listen carefully to make out the dialogue in the midst of strong British accents (English, Scottish, Welch).

In Millions Like Us Patricia Roc plays Cecilia, a young woman living at home with her father and sisters.  Her mother has passed away but this an otherwise ordinary middle class English home in the early 1940s.  Her brother Tom has been called up into the Army service and is away.  The threat of Hitler looms on the radio.  Her Dad fought the Germans in WW I and in addition to his job he drills with the Home Guard three nights per week.  We are shown the ordinary travails of this familys life.  Cecilia (Patricia Roc) has two sisters:  one is married with several children and the other is very interested in boys.  Cecilia though prettiest is shy but not afraid of boys.  She is chaste.  She is humble.  She dreams of meeting a nice boy some day; someone whom she can love and who will love her.  Someone in a word she might marry.

War breaks out.  Cecilia, called up into the womens service, finds her self placed in factory work, the last thing she wanted to do.  She works with thousands of other mostly younger women in a great factory making parts for airplanes.  The women live in a dormitory two to a room.  (cf Kurosawas The Most Beautiful in which a similar experience of work and living is described for young Japanese women during WWII.) One day nearby RAF (Royal Air Force) trainees are given a tour of the factory.  The desire of young women for the love and companionship of young men is described beautifully along with the longing of young men for young women.  The tender workings of love begin for Cecilia and Fred, a young Scottish Sergeant being trained to be a Navigator on board an English Bomber.  Love and life run their course.

The beauty of this movie is its honest description of the simplicity of human life.  We have a very simple British family.  In the midst of and despite scarcity, dislocation and the suffering of war on the home front loves seeds are planted and grow.

British World War II movies were made during a time when that country was in the midst of a life and death struggle.  180,000 civilians died in German bombing of English cities.  There is therefore a seriousness and an earnestness about these British movies that is yet lighthearted.  Life must go on.  English men and women had to live each day never knowing whether they would lose the war or whether they would even survive it.  This created a very strong and positive spirit.  One in which life was deeply affirmed.  This movie expresses that spirit.",1525478400,,2638,4.54468085106383
8040644,5,B00069MOI6,"You can't give Patricia Roc anything less than 5 stars.  It was also pleasant to see Irene Handl.  Wartime propaganda.  My Dad was in the 10th Mountain Division; they suffered 10% casualties.  I don't know the percent of wounded except that he was one of them.  He died in 1973 at 48 years.  Supposedly the war made sense to him, probably because of propaganda movies like this one?  My Vietnam era generation are a little more skeptical.  For thirty years it seemed obvious the communists won World War Two.  For a couple of years now, I realized Jews conceived and implemented communism.  That means for all their crying, the Jews won World War Two.  Here in America, Jews control both parties.  I'll leave it to the Europeans to figure out who controls your governments.  The only people fighting the communists/Jews in World War Two were the Germans.",1501632000,,854,4.727891156462585
8040645,5,B00069MOI6,"Very interesting movie, if not somewhat predictable. I've not seen a war time movie with anything like this scenario before.

8040646,5,B00069MOI6,"This movie was great! On every level, it was characterized as truly representative of Britain at home during the war years. The factory scenes and the stories of the workers lives, the music, the filming and acting, the directing, everything was truly heroic and richly rewarding. The two army chaps who kept turning up and making comments were a clever addition, as were the rich characterizations of Teresa Roc's family and friends in the film. I'm just so glad I didn't miss this one.",1498608000,,487,4.809523809523809
8040647,5,B00069MOI6,Good World War 2 film on the home front in England.,1487030400,,51,3.727272727272727
8040648,4,B00069MOI6,"""Millions Like Us"" is a black and white movie made in England during World War II. It is essentially a sort of morale-boosting propaganda film, highlighting the contributions of everyday women from throughout the UK, from all walks of life and social classes, who were 'called up' and put to work serving the war industries.

The movie begins with brief samplings of what a few women's lives were like before the war, then shows their experiences being recruited, trained, and serving. The movie, although its message is serious, also includes a healthy dose of human comedy, e.g. the misadventures of an elderly father of multiple women who are all away serving their country, as he tries to be a home maker on his own and still serve as a 'lights out!' air raid warden.

A couple of the women have wartime romances, and there is some tragedy mixed in.

Of particular value to war history buffs is the fact that much of the movie was filmed in actual places, so a couple women who work in a huge aircraft parts factory are shown in the real places along side real workers. The movie is renowned as being an accurate depiction of what it was like to work in such places, from the morale boosting, to rotating shifts, to the air raid bunkers inside the factories yet only a few steps from the machines so minimum time would be wasted going to and fro during the raids, to the music played over loudspeakers to signal and motivate (Raymond Scott's ""Powerhouse"" was played, and I wonder if they got the idea from the pre-war Looney Tunes cartoons).

Overall, an enjoyable and informative bit of historical drama.",1473379200,3,1609,4.654929577464789
