8250991,4,B0013HA82O,"I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews here, and I go with the consensus and rate it somewhere between three and four stars. My four stars are mostly for historic significance. As with many celebrity bio documentaries this one is a little erratic and choppy. But Elisabeth Furtwanglers comments are fascinating and the video snippets of Furtwangler in rehearsal are most welcome. Also of interest are readings from Furtwanglers writings on music, interpretation and other topics. An additional, happy, surprise is the sampling, far too fleeting, we hear of Furtwangler's compositions. Though far from perfect, this DVD adds to the legacy of an artist whose star continues to burn ever brighter in the conducting pantheon.",1448236800,,729,5.1344537815126055
8250992,3,B0013HA82O,This interesting documentary has some fascinating insights into the art of Wilhelm Furtwangler. It is well worth having if you are a Furtwangler enthusiast. The .mp3 files of his lectures and rehearsals are a great bonus. I found there to be a few too many long close-ups of Elizabeth's face. It would have been nice to know who the people were in the footage of the informal concert at her house. The excerpts of WF conducting Don Giovanni and rehearsing Schubert's Unfinished were beautifully restored. The footage of anonymous couples kissing did not add much to the content.,1261699200,3,578,4.908163265306122
8250993,4,B0013HA82O,"This film presents the story of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, arguably the greatest conductor of the 20th century, as told mainly through interviews with his widow Elisabeth. She shares personal memories, anecdotes, letters and photos in this short, 70-minute documentary.

The strength of the movie is clearly just the fact that this is Furtw&auml;ngler's wife, telling a story that no one else could tell. A narrator gives background information and reads from Furtw&auml;ngler's writings about how he reacted to various aspects of his career -- such as starting a career in conducting when he really just wanted to be a composer. There is some nice footage of Furtw&auml;ngler conducting in rehearsal and concert.

Elisabeth Furtw&auml;ngler does talk about her husband's well-known womanizing and illegitimate children, and she also talks about his decision to stay in Germany despite the Nazi regime taking power in 1933. While the film is not a whitewash of Furtw&auml;ngler, it certainly presents him in a positive light overall. It is nice to get a feeling for his personal attitudes and characteristics through his wife's eyes.

On the other hand, the absence of any details whatsoever on the years under the Nazi regime is a big hole in the film and its most obvious shortcoming. Who better than his wife could have given us a picture of the man's personal attitudes and reactions to life under the Nazis?

The film does provide a great service by getting interviews with Furtw&auml;ngler's wife recorded for posterity. This is a personal story only she can tell, and I'm grateful the film was made.

But in the end, it is a flawed work as well. The filmmakers don't really succeed in creating a compelling narrative that would be of significance to anyone who is not already a fan of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler and who does not know the basics of his life already. So you might consider rental options instead of a purchase straightaway.

Note that the DVD has no video extras -- total run time is 70 minutes. However, it does contain quite a collection of MP3 files on the disc of interviews, rehearsals etc with Furtw&auml;ngler (in German). The MP3s are not accessible through the DVD menu. To see them, put the DVD in your computer and look at the disc in Windows Explorer or the equivalent on a Mac. From there you can copy to your hard disc using drag-and-drop.

I would also highly recommend two films that deal more with the ""dark side"" of Furtw&auml;ngler's collaboration with the Nazi regime, still without condemning the man:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reichsorchester-The-Berlin-Philharmonic/dp/B0012K53UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reichsorchester: The Berlin Philharmonic</a>&nbsp;and the fictional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Sides/dp/B0001DCR0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Sides</a>.",1245974400,10,2920,5.65296803652968
8250994,4,B0013HA82O,"Esta produccin es muy buena desde el punto de vista testimonial, pero se torna en ocasiones montona, pues es sobreabundante en este aspecto; sin embargo, en ella escasean las imgenes del gran director de la Berliner Philharmoniker. En ocasiones se abruma al espectador con prolongadas imgenes del Berln de hoy. De todas formas, es muy valioso desde el punto de vista de conocer al Furtwngler de carne y hueso ms all del estricto y metdico Director de Orquesta.",1221436800,4,460,4.910256410256411
8250995,4,B0013HA82O,"I found this personal account by Elisabeth Furtwangeler of how she met Furtwangler, how he wooed her, and how she fell in love with him very fascinating. She met him after he had fathered several illegitimate children. But this seems to have not deterred her. She refused his early advances, but in time was overcome by his personality. She defends Furtwangler's decision to stay in Germany during the war (WW2). What is not clear to me is her relationship to the Nazi party and Nazi movement. She does not say much about her discomfort with the state of Germany under Nazism. Her account of Furtwangler's death is also quite interesting. I would highly recommend this video to anyone interested in Furtwangler.",1216252800,13,711,4.884297520661157
