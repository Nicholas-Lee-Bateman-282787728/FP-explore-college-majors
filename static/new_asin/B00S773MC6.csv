Normally you expect anime like this from Japan, but he Malaysian are obviously entering the arena and will give the Japanese a run for their money. The animation is top notch, the story was excellent, and the voice work well done if a little over the top. Be warned though: this is a movie with an alternate Earth in which the time line changes with the 1899 Martian Invasion of Great Britain as portrayed in H.G. Wells book ""The War of the Worlds"". The opening scene of the move begins with a tripod attack in Leeds that ends with the Martians succumbing to earth's bacteria as in the original novel. In no way is this movie related to the 1953 classic, or the 2005 reboot. It is a film entirely on its own. Without revealing too much about the film itself, I hope there is a sequel so that we can take the fight to the Martians!

If people are concerned whether or not it will play on their DVD, I was able to get my DVD to play it in North America.",1496016000,,1002,4.191709844559585
