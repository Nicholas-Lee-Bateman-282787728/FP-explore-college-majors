1923786,5,B0000DBJ8M,"Absolutely beautiful stories, when I was a child, we only had one of these episodes on tape, and the quality has deteriorated significantly.  Now all three on one DVD, with high quality audio and video, is a true Christmas present.  Perfect for fans of the show, or animal lovers.",1158105600,5,280,4.6938775510204085
1923787,5,B0000DBJ8M,"Lassie's Christmas Stories is a successful compilation of three episodes in Timmy times. As all Lassie's Tales, these are a message of love, pity and share with some funny moments. It would be a wonderful Christmas Gift.",1123372800,4,220,4.972972972972973
1923788,5,B0000DBJ8M,"You won't be disappointed with these holiday episodes from ""Lassie."" The picture quality and soundtrack are excellent. All episodes are in b/w. None of the episodes appear on any other dvd collection to my knowledge.

In episode 1 (1958), Lassie undergoes delicate surgery in the Martin kitchen on Christmas Eve after being hit by a car. Friends and neighbors gather in the farmyard to express their best wishes. Lovely carols from the Les Baxter Choir provide the background music throughout the episode.

In episode 2 (1960), the Martins provide a Merry Christmas for a poor, California-bound family living in a tool shed while their car is being repaired.

In episode 3 (1961), the Martins are paid a visit by their old friends Pearly Mae Yochim and her young son Billy Joe. Pearly Mae and Billy Joe have faced some very painful days since last seeing the Martins but a wonderful surprise for Billy Joe is discovered on the Martin doorstep Christmas morning.

All episodes star Lockhart, Reilly, and Provost. Ellen Corby (best remembered perhaps as the grandmother in ""The Waltons"") appears as Pearly Mae Yochim in the third episode. These are delightful tales and even Scrooge's heart would warm to their charm. A wonderful addition to your Christmas dvd collection!",1121731200,17,1270,5.033333333333333
1923789,5,B0000DBJ8M,"They don't make 'em like this anymore: three heartwarming LASSIE Christmas stories featuring the Martin family. In the first one, Lassie is struck by a truck while saving a three-year-old girl. When she needs expert surgery, the Martins attempt to contact a research veterinarian who can do the job. Interspersed with beautiful Christmas carols by the Les Baxter Choir. The second story has Timmy and Lassie helping a boy and girl who are on the run with their destitute father. In the third episode, the Martins' old friends the Yochims spend Christmas Eve with the family. Son Billy Joe, Lassie and Timmy rescue a man trapped under an overturned sleigh...and Billy Joe suddenly believes the man is Santa Claus. All great stuff.

I met Jon Provost at a Nostalgia convention in Maryland a few years back and he is one incredible, nice, down to earth great guy.  Kleenex when I think of this show, my life back then coming from a broken home, and all my dog and this show meant to me.

1923811,5,B0000DBJ8M,"A perect gift for my daughter. She is 35 years old now but used to watch Lassie as a child. She was always so worried about Lassie. She would come crying to me about Lassie in the abandoned mine or the river. I would say "" Remember Lassie always gets home ok"". She never stopped fretting over Lassies safety. What a hoot to give this DVD to her this last Christmas.",1365465600,,365,4.154929577464789
1923812,3,B0000DBJ8M,"I have this collection on VHS.  It's good -- especially the one where Lassie has surgery; but for a show that spanned approximately 19 years on TV, I don't think just 3 Christmas episodes is enough of a 'collection'.  More Christmas episodes, please.  In fact, publish the complete Lassie series.",1363564800,,296,4.88

1923822,3,B0000DBJ8M,"I only gave this three stars -- usually most of my reviews have five --- because there are only three Lassie Christmas shows on this disc!  I read the review before I purchased because I love Lassie as well as Christmas -- the three shows are very good, but I wish there were more!  Not bad for the price, but still leaves one wanting to see more Lassie Christmas shows!  I see that there are very few Lassie episodes released on DVD -- some on VCR - individual shows.  Hope the powers that be read this review and decide to release more Lassie - Christmas and otherwise!  It was just a wonderful show - warm, human, simple, which always left one happy at the end (as a child I used to put my hand up to the television screen to ""shake"" Lassie's extended paw at the end of each episode). We need to see this wonderful show again, especially in this day and age.",1295222400,3,861,4.225609756097561

1923824,5,B0000DBJ8M,"One of my professional quests over the years has been to watch all the available ""Christmas movies"" and ""Christmas TV specials"" available on DVD, although I started this back when I was collecting them on VHS video tape.

As you might expect, if you enjoy a good Christmas tale, there's a swamp of bad DVDs every year for each gem that surfaces. And this three-episode set of ""Lassie"" Christmas classics from 1958, 1960 and 1961 is a true gem!

A lot of ""classic TV on DVD"" from this era is released in slap-dash fashion, often in tough-to-watch prints with fuzzy sound. In this case, Sony plays a role and all three episodes are as crisp and clear as when we first saw these episodes half a century ago.

Sure, there are stereotypes here. Sure, this is an idealized view of rural America. And, sure, Lassie performs more miraculous tricks in half an hour than most dogs could hope to perform in a year. (In one case, Lassie helps to move a heavy, overturned sleigh to save a man's life.) But none of these are reasons to avoid these classic tales. In fact, peering back into these episodes is a glimpse back into the idealized images a lot of us held back in that era--like the idea that neighbors ought to help each other and even lend a hand when down-on-their-luck strangers pass through town.

The Santa Claus episode from 1961 is my favorite in this set, closely followed by the story of a talented veterinarian who saves Lassie's life--all because of the connective power of modern radio!

I can heartily recommend this set, among the many we've seen this year.",1261440000,7,1568,4.585714285714285
1923825,5,B0000DBJ8M,"I grew up with Lassie and I made sure my kids did too. Now I have my grandchildren watching. It's family entertainment at it's best. You never worry if something inappropriate will be sneaked in ... you don't HAVE to watch it with the kids, you just want to. There is a lesson of love in each episode of Lassie. What more could we want for our young people?",1253059200,13,357,4.188405797101449
