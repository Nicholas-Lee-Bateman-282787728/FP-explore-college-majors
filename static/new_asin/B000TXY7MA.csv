8211373,1,B000TXY7MA,"I still have no idea what I am looking at in this ""Early Vaudeville"" DVD.  It looks as if the characters are modern and are pretending that they are back in the early 1900s.  Then on the DVD cover it says ""these films seek to recreate the atmosphere of a theatre performance.""  Recreate?  Recreate!  This is a presentation of the ""Historical Archive"" so I thought we were talking about legitimate Vaudeville performances.... apparently not, these are re-creations.",1355616000,3,464,4.974025974025974
8211374,5,B000TXY7MA,"As a variety entertainer this was a great find to see some of what my predecessors at work.  While the dog and pony shows haven't changed much over the years, watching what was considered titillating to the old time burlesque compared to the modern counterparts is great.  I do recommend picking out a good CD to play while watching since obviously these are all old silents and no soundtrack was added.",1276387200,5,403,4.661971830985915
8211375,5,B000TXY7MA,"They were both ""borrowed"" and never returned! This is a MUST for people interested in vaudeville!!!!",1270944000,5,100,5.3125
8211376,5,B000TXY7MA,"In the late 1890s, nickelodeons began popping up by the thousand all over the United States. These tiny movie houses showed what were essentially film clips by today's standards. The customer base was primarily working poor and transplanted Europeans, for in their infancy, the movies (and those who attended them) were considered d&eacute;class&eacute; by genteel society. Immigrants (especially those who didn't speak English), found these flickering moving images helpful in learning the ways of America.

Early film vignettes were quite diverse-- circus and other parades, winter sports, skyscraper construction, street urchin gymnasts, open air markets, pushcart peddlers, panoramic cityline vistas or candid ground-level shots of a busy street were all subjects of pioneer cameramen. (For such examples, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NEW-YORK-CITY-NY-45-VERY-EARLY-FILMS-FROM-1898-1905/dp/B000KI0ZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NEW YORK CITY NY - 45 VERY EARLY FILMS FROM 1898-1905</a>.) The movies weren't always direct-from-life or meant to be educational. Some were simply for fun, as this unusual collection of vaudeville performances demonstrates.

The DVD program is divided into seven categories: Animal Acts, Burlesque, Comic Sketches, Dance, Dramatic, Physical Culture and Tableau (there's only one of these). A title and date precedes each segment. There is no audio track. Video quality on some films is grainy and a bit blurred; others are badly degraded-- about what you'd expect from century old nitrate stock and paper prints. Projection speed is off, so the disc is best viewed on a PC DVD player (like InterVideo) with playback set at 70% of normal. At this speed, running time is considerably over 2 hours.
