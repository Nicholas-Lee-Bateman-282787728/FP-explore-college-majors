5146102,4,B008BJU1YM,My brother and I would go to the video rental store and rent this movie over and over.  It was a staple in our movie rotation.  Funny and Campy I suggest this movie.  Cheesy narration is great.,1354752000,,193,4.162162162162162

8526616,1,B008BJU1YM,"One star is very generous for thjis poor excuse for a movie. I was around for the first run episodes of Rocky & Bullwinkle, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, and Fractured Fairy Tales. I really enjoyed these and especially Boris and Natasha. And I have really enjoyed Sally Kellerman in many of her film roles. But this film is so bad it has nothing to recommend it. It really deserved negative stars.",1495756800,,390,4.507042253521127
8526617,5,B008BJU1YM,"A Very Funny Movie.

For anyone that grew up in the Era it
is worth the Money and Time to Watch it.

It showed up right when Amazon said it would.",1490227200,,146,3.6774193548387095
8526618,2,B008BJU1YM,"Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale were two of my favorite characters from the old ""Bullwinkle and Rocky"" Show.
They were perfect subjects for a full  feature film.
Unfortunately, this was a flop.
Sally Kellerman and Dave Thomas were excellent choices for the lead characters, but they could not rise above a terrible script and horrible screenplay. Their talents were wasted
 The great one-liners, the double entendre, the sinister smirks and giggles from the cartoon characters were all lacking.
 The plot about a time turning microchip might have worked, but it was bogged down by less than subtle twists that merely added length to the film, making it more of a chore to watch it to then end than a pleasure.
There were a few brief glimpses at what might have been, especially with the narrator's commentary adding some sense of continuity from the old cartoon. Even that wasn't used often enough to be effective.
The film was cluttered with too much unnecessary garbage merely for the sake of padding the film.
Some day, someone might come up with a proper vehicle for Pottsylvania's two most famous spies. Until then, only the most diehard Rocky and Bullwinkle fans should watch this.
Such a pity.",1420329600,2,1201,4.906403940886699

8526621,5,B008BJU1YM,I recommmend watching this after watching all 5 seasons of the original Rocky and Bullwinkle series but before the The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle movie,1382227200,,157,5.076923076923077
8526622,5,B008BJU1YM,"I think this is a fun, dumb movie, which it should be since it mirrors the cartoon characters.  I enjoy watching it. Who doesn't love Boris and Natasha?",1375228800,,152,4.428571428571429
8526623,4,B008BJU1YM,"This movie is one of my childhood favorites. The Boris and Natasha characters from Rocky and Bullwinkle shine here in live action the narrator, if you're familiar with Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, does not disappoint, either.",1362441600,,227,5.333333333333333
