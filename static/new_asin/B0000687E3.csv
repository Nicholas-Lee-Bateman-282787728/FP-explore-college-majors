1723279,5,B0000687E3,"I have the revised edition of this set and it was money well spent. The Stero-optical Process is always fun but the most overlooked quality of these gems is how they really get inside of you. Some call these cheesy and some are but cartoons like ""Somewhere in Dreamland,"" ""Play Safe,"" and ""The Little Dutch Mill"" are impossible to watch without tearing up. Now DISNEY cartoons are cheesy! They're just pointless romping and frollicing through daisies. These Fleischer shorts have morals and messages that really get to you.",1125014400,20,523,4.954545454545454
1723280,4,B0000687E3,"These are wonderful cartoons that I grew up with as a child and I'm only 25. It's amazing how cartoons nowadays have become so self indulgent and garish. It seems that the majority of these newer animated series have lost perspective of it's target audience and have been putting out mellowdramatic garbage since the  mid-nineties. I think children of this generation would appreciate something lighthearted and refreshing like a collection of Fleischer cartoons.

There is one little flaw to this specific collection, though. In the middle of the first DVD it continues to play the same episode  repeatedly... and from what I've read here in these previous  reviews it's not only my DVD. Granted, it's not that big of a deal. All you have to do is return to the menu and select the next episode to play. Glitches and all, I think it's worth having these great cartoons on DVD.",1099526400,15,877,4.788079470198675
1723281,5,B0000687E3,"This 2 disc DVD set features all but one of the ""Color Classics"" that were released by Paramount Pictures in the 30s and 40s.  These cartoons were originally shown in theaters between features.  In the 50s through the 70s, these cartoons were shown on TV.  In the 80s and 90s, with the cartoons in the public domain, they were put on VHS and sold cheaply by various companies.  Now they are available on DVD.
As all of these cartoons are in the public domain, and these prints are made from the best available copies, these prints have faded, scratches and in some cases poor soundtracks.  However being the only DVD release of all but one of the ""Color Classics"" makes this a well worthwhile buy.
The DVD has audio commentary for some cartoons, one with a commentary by Betty Boop herself.  There is also an artwork gallery showing some original conceptual sketches for certain cartoons.  Some prints of cartoons have been digitally enhanced, and some of these prints are the best quality that I have seen thus far, or at least until the original studio makes prints from the original negatives.
It's a worthwhile buy to relieve your childhood.",1087948800,30,1145,4.723618090452261
1723282,3,B0000687E3,"Despite ""OK"" video quality and rather vanilla audio commentaries, this is the only DVD I know of that took the effort to preserve these rare master works. Good for kids or animation collectors.

1723283,4,B0000687E3,"Republic Entertainment should be indicted for cultural crimes since they refuse to release first-generation prints of Max and Dave Fleischer's ""Color Classics"" series. As a result of this neglect, VCI and Kit Parker Films have compiled ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" - a fine collection of public-domain Fleischer cartoons from 1934 to 1941. Most of the ""Color Classics"" are represented in this two-DVD set, with the print quality ranging from excellent to poor. The series contains several Fleischer gems, including Betty Boop's ""Poor Cinderella"" (1934), ""The Kids in the Shoe"" (1935), ""The Cobweb Hotel"" (1936), ""All's Fair at the Fair"" (1938) and ""Ants in the Plants"" (1940). Though influenced by the success of Disney's ""Silly Symphonies,"" the Fleischer spirit is evident in many ""Color Classics,"" particularly the lesser-known entries such as ""Chicken Ala King"" (1936), ""A Car-Tune Portrait"" (1936) and ""Hold It!"" (1937). The DVD set also features two Oscar-nominated shorts, ""Educated Fish"" (1937) and ""Hunky and Spunky"" (1938), which are enjoyable but do not represent the Fleischers' best work. Until Republic gets its act together, ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" will remain the definitive ""Color Classics"" collection and is highly recommended to aficionados of vintage animation.",1055548800,121,1277,5.6217616580310885
1723284,5,B0000687E3,"These cartoons are not restored in any real sense, and a few are pretty rough - to the point of being unwatchable. One has the audio and video out of sync by two seconds. I wish Greedy Humpty Dumpty was in better shape, which is near the top of my list of Fleisher cartoons. My copy snags on disk 1, item 7, and I have to go back to the menu to prompt it along. Fans of Fleischer will nevertheless embrace this collection and thank the producers for making available in any form what we would not otherwise have. I enjoyed the audio commentary provided by the producers. Fleischer videos and DVDs come and go, and I suspect it will just be a question of time before Republic or someone invests the money to fully restore the Color Classics - probably not in my lifetime, though. My children, as well as I, love this DVD collection. Although the price is a little steep, it's still a good value for 4.5 hours of Fleischer magic!",1037059200,14,927,4.333333333333333
1723285,4,B0000687E3,"This collection represents a quest to track down every one of the 36 Fleischer Studios `Color Classics' cartoon series. There are 35 of them  on these two disks. One of the `Color Classics', ""Time For Love"" has only survived in a single black and white print found in Europe (this was seven years ago and a color version has since turned up).  The only `Color Classics' cartoon not included is ""Tears Of An Onion"" which is explained as not being here because ""it is under copyright and therefore not in `public domain'"" This explains a lot because obviously Jerry Beck and company are on a budget.  Despite the poor condition of some of the prints included here, there are two processes that I know of that are used to transfer film to video and/or digital; one is a frame-by-frame reader that takes the image directly off of the film for maximum clarity and color but it is a tedious process and is costly.  Look at the excellent Disney collection of `Silly Symphonies' if you want to see how it should be done.  The second process which seems to be used by all other DVD/VHS collections of cartoons I've seen, including this one, is projecting the film onto a reader screen that will inevitably shave a little off the top, bottom and sides of the image and loses some image and color integrity.  The result is one we cartoon affectionados are becoming used to in VHS and DVD collections, kinda dark and kinda fuzzy and it makes you wish you could have been there at the theater at the time.  But for now this is all we're going to get.  I've watched this one several times now anyway though.

1723286,5,B0000687E3,"""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is a 2-disk set featuring over 30 Technicolor animated shorts by Max Fleischer.  The DVD mainly collects the ""Color Classics"" series, which were produced to showcase the Fleischer's ""Stero-optical Process,"" whereby the animators placed cells over three-dimensional backgrounds to create the illusion of depth.
The cartoons have undergone both digital picture and sound restoration, and the disk is packed with bonus features.  Included are commentary by animation historian Jerry Beck, production artwork still frame gallery, a documentary about the Fleischer studio including excerpts from additional Color Classics cartoons.  Also, a separate Mono audio track is available, preserving the sound as originally presented.
Highlights of the set include ""Greedy Humpty Dumpty,"" ""The Cobweb Hotel,"" ""Ants In The Plants,"" ""Dancing On The Moon,"" ""Hold It,"" ""An Elephant Never Forgets,"" and ""Small Fry"" and ""The Fresh Vegetable Mystery."" Betty Boop appears in ""Poor Cinderella"" and Grampy shows up for ""Christmas Comes But Once a Year.""  Also included are two Academy Award Cartoon Short Subject nominees - ""Educated Fish"" (1937) and ""Hunky and Spunky"" (1938).  Of course, ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is also included.
The Fleischer studios have not been treated well by DVD.  Let's hope ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is the start of a new trend.",1021939200,92,1357,5.627450980392157

Though the restoration isn't perfect in some of the cartoons, I greatly appriecate Jerry Beck and VCI's intiative in releasing these Fleischer classics (and shame on those holding the rights for ""Tears of an onion"" for not letting us see it in this collection!). These cartoons, showing a very different, sometimes dark and sinister, and always more surreal approach than the Disney cartoons makes me wonder if the Fleischers (also the creators of POPEYE, SUPERAMN, and BETTY BOOP)were ahead of their time and maybe that's way they were economically unsucceful and lost theit studio (who after being taken over by Paramount did nice cartoons, but without the special quality the Fleischer's kind had) . And speaking of BETTY BOOP: She appears in this collection in her only colored film, and I only wish someone (Jerry again?) would initiate a full and hopefully best restoration possible of Betty's cartoons, for the antic cartoons afectioniados and for those not knowing that Betty was a film star way before her merchandising present era.",1320364800,3,1169,5.062176165803109

 I loved the set and what they did to try to cleanup the POPEYES and this

The Fleischer studios Color Classics are excellent short animated films. The simple stories are memorable and the animation is unique. The characters are made to be rather cute and the rotoscope backgrounds are an unusual touch. These films do not get the credit they deserve, but here they are to be rediscovered.

Somewhere in Dreamland is an obvious standout. Two desperately poor children walk home to find a meager dinner of bread and coffee. They go to bed and dream of a world of undulating sweets and happiness. When they wake, they find that the neighborhood has gathered a collection of goodies for them to enjoy.

Play Safe is a sweet little story about a curious little boy and the dog that protects him. When the boy wanders away from the yard, it is up to the dog to save him.

Christmas Comes But Once a Year features a group of orphans in the poorhouse who have very little for Christmas. A local man dresses us as Santa Claus and makes all sorts of creative toys from odds and ends for the children.

In Little Lamby, a wolf comes to town and sets his sights on a tasty young lamb. He lures it to him by holding a ""cutest baby"" contest among all of the animals. Little do they know that the winner will become his dinner.

The Fresh Vegetable Mystery is very well done; the baby carrots turn up missing and some mischievious creatures do all they can to prevent them from being found.

Several rare cartoons are found in the Lost Episodes feature, a short documentary about the Fleischer cartoons and the making of this DVD set. The Kids in the Shoe is included here, a great short about the woman who lived in the shoe. She puts the children to bed and goes off to take her nap, and the kids wake up to play some great jazz.

Overall, this is a great set. The picture quality isn't always amazing, but all of the cartoons are watchable and appropriate for all ages.",1228608000,6,2215,4.398533007334963
1723416,3,B0000687E3,"Popping this DVD into your player and starting it up leads to a bit of an initial disappointment when you figure out that the video quality is a Grade D relative to the Grade A transfers in the Disney Silly Symphony sets.  That being said, the video quality issues do not appear to be a result of laziness but longstanding neglect in the original films.  So, while the video quality is lacking, it is an understandable evil.  The video commentaries make up for the video issues and the subject matter itself is charming and engaging.  Ultimately, if you are purchasing this for your kids, they won't give a damn about the video quality or commentaries and will focus on the content, which is excellent.",1224201600,9,702,4.637096774193548
1723417,4,B0000687E3,"An excellent compilation of Fleischer's early color work which once and for all proves his pre-eminence as the greatest early American animator. The sophistication, the sly politics and the wonderful use of new technologies
make his competitors seem much less important than revisionist Disney historians would have us believe.
Sadly, the only thing missing with this dvd treat is a hard copy of some sort - at least a list of titles would help! Nada; niente; rien. For those of us who have spent fortunes on the wonderfully restored Looney Tunes dvd sets, the lack of extras here is a little tragic.
Fleischer fans will thrill to this dvd notwithstanding.",1221091200,,656,4.972727272727273
1723418,2,B0000687E3,"There is no mistake this is a great collection of classics cartoons by Max Fleischer. But it would have been great if they were restored digitally as Disney did with their Silly Symphonies. Some of the cartoons are blurry in some parts or too dark to the point that you don't know what is on screen. I wish this would have been explained in another review before I bought this set! The funny thing is that there's a docummentary that explains why a cartoon is missing and why the others are in so bad shape. If you like Max Fleischer, try the Popeye sets instead.",1220140800,8,563,4.371428571428571
1723419,5,B0000687E3,"Long before the rise of the Disney empire, animation had Max Fleischer and his whimsical illustrators producing some of the best cartoon shorts of all time. This collection contains most of them. It acts as a dipstick of American history. Innocence, whimsy, charm and naivity are clearly brought to life, with a depth not seen since.

I remember watching these gems early in the morning with my mother describing the time period to me. The 1930s come to life with singing, dancing and hope that was needed at the time. Compared to everything that followed, it seemed to lack something. Children of all ages would appreciate this magical world that seems to be alive without modern CGI effects.",1194220800,2,693,4.872881355932203

40 years after...the tears still flow.

1723421,4,B0000687E3,"The Max Fleischer Color Classics were Fleischer's attempt to make similar cartoons to what Disney was doing with Silly Symphonies. In retrospect it seems like a mistake, since they were not as unaccustomed to doing soft fluffy harmless characters like Disney did. It's interesting to see how they handled similar subject matter differently.

These are classic cartoons, but I was a little disappointed because of the technical glitches. One major problem was that on one of the best cartoons on the set, ""An Elephant Never Forgets"", the audio is a little out of sync which is highly annoying. And you do have to hit the menu button a lot.

The video quality is OK but it is all taken from public domain sources so if you have these cartoons on other public domain releases there won't be much improvement there. The audio commentary and art extras are nice. I would have liked to have seen more stressing the differences between Disney and Fleischer.",1184544000,2,950,4.822085889570552

It is great to learn the reason behind why the quality of the shorts are the way they are presented in this set but it is really sad and unfortunate.
