3851109,5,B00264H4EI,I bought this for my 6 year old who absolutely loves Vendetta - Unique and fun. Wish they'd make more.,1294444800,,102,4.15

3851111,5,B00264H4EI,"Making Fiends is the story of two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, and the terrified people of the town of Clamburg. It is unclear exactly how old Vendetta and Charlotte are, though I would guess between 8 and 10 years of age. Vendetta has set herself up as the tyrant-mistress of Clamburg through her strange talent for creating ""fiends""..., vicious monsters of various shapes and sizes whose sole purpose is to carry out Vendetta's will.  To say that Vendetta is mean and nasty is an understatement. She is a cold blooded evil little girl who delights in the horror and suffering and demise of anyone who annoys her.  She laughs and cheers at the notion of others being mutilated or devoured whole by her fiends. The only comparison I can think of , is the evil fairy godmother Maleficent from Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  it's not clear if the ""fiends"" Vendetta makes are created via magic or science, or a little of both.., but she crafts them like a chef creating a dish from various ingredients.

Charlotte is a new adorable little girl in Clamburg who moved into a house with her Grandmother.  Charlotte is not merely the exact opposite of Vendetta, Charlotte has a love and joy for life and for playing and making friends that goes over the top, capped off with a very simple and childish innocence that blinds her completely to any bad or evil intent from others.  This makes her totally fearless of Vendetta and of Vendetta's ""fiends"".  Charlotte meets Vendetta and tries to be friendly to her.  Vendetta is outraged at her lack of fear and tries hard to force Charlotte into being like the other citizens of Clamburg who cower in fear of her and obey her every command.  But Vendetta fails miserably.  Every attempt to frighten and coerce Charlotte ends up with Charlotte misunderstanding Vendetta's intent..., thinking that Vendetta is merely trying to play with her.

This resistance by Charlotte infuriates Vendetta who sics various types of vicious frightening fiends against her in the hope of either driving Charlotte away, or actually ending her existence..., neither of which happens.  The fiends that Vendetta sends to attack Charlotte do not ..., because Charlotte is so charming and loving and friendly that the fiends themselves are won-over by her exuberant personality..., and she often ends up making pets of the fiends.

This is a very clever animated series that has a creative hand-drawn style of animation with simple but stark colors that produces an overall ""storybook"" effect which is very appealing to watch.  The humor comes from the clash of personalities between Vendetta and Charlotte , usually with Vendetta getting the worst of it. This series is as fun for adults as it is for kids, and this is what tends to make an animated series rise above and beyond others. There is a message..., a lesson that can be learned from Making Fiends..., and perhaps it is that the biggest hearts win in the end, or, perhaps that ""evil"" only holds influence over those who allow it to.

This set comes with two DVDs's in a single case.  The video and audio were perfect.  I highly recommend this set to everyone of all ages.

3851112,5,B00264H4EI,"Love, love, love this show! Both simple and sophisticated, Making Fiends is a scream. I love the characters, the catchy little songs, and the quirky humor (anyone for an onion treat?) I especially love that both heroine and villian are female characters.

The animation has a pleasing simplicity on the surface, which complements beautifully the varied use of background textures. Amy Winfrey (""Charlotte"") and Aglaia Mortcheva (""Vendetta"") are fabulous as the polar-opposite little girls, as are the other talented people who lend their voices to the show. Ego Plum's music is perfect at capturing both Charlotte's cheeriness and Vendetta's comical malevolence.

Yes, Making Fiends is a little dark in places, but not much more so than an episode of the original ""Addams Family"". Any real mayhem is mostly only hinted at, and never comes to pass. (The episodes invariably end up with a happy resolution for sunny Charlotte, and a frustrating failure for plotting Vendetta). One of the darkest episodes ends (spoiler ahead!) with teacher Mr. Milk giving up his own potential happiness to keep Charlotte safe.

It is probably best to check out Making Fiends first for yourself - as of this post it is still running on Nickelodeon on the weekends. It might not be appropriate for younger children, but older kids - and their parents - will definitey enjoy it.",1273881600,4,1357,5.076233183856503
3851113,5,B00264H4EI,"My 10 yr old daughter loves this show, what's more I love to watch it with her. It's become our show to watch together when ever we can find it, which is not to often. It is a little dark for a children's cartoon and probably not ideal for younger kids.",1272931200,,253,3.980392156862745
3851114,5,B00264H4EI,"My son just grajuated from 3rd grade and just LOVES cartoons (nicktoons
network is his favorite channel.)  Out of all of those cartoons MAKING
FIENDS is his favorite show - likes it more than his PS2!!!  WARNING:
DO NOT BUY FOR AGES 1 DAY TO 8 1/2 - TALKS ABOUT REAL KILLING,GUNS, AND WORST OF ALL ADULT WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1246233600,,322,4.5344827586206895
3851115,4,B00264H4EI,"Season 1 of ""Making Fiends"" is on DVD, finally!

After being a faithful fan of the show, collecting the webshow DVDs, entering an art contest and even talking to Amy Winfrey, the creator, herself, I couldn't be happier that a TV show was being made!

18 episodes of sublime humor, good and unique coloring/animation, and hilarious voice acting are included on these 2 discs.  It's labeled as ""Season 1"" here, and these are all the TV episodes created thus far.

An entire season 2 of 7 episodes has been written, and will be put into production if the show gets popular enough.  As the #1 Nicktoons Network show, it's getting there!  But we need to write to Nickelodeon and buy the merchandise in order to keep the show going!

Back to the DVD...  2 disc set, not bad at all.  Good menus and packaging from what I see.

Two downsides, though:
#1- No bonus features.  At least they could've included the 3-minute ""Making Making Fiends"" documentary that aired on Nickelodeon in 2007 and maybe the webseries.
#2- WAY too expensive.  If it had a lot of bonus features, maybe the price would fit.  But ""The Fairly OddParents!: Season 1"" has the same amount of episodes and is a lot cheaper.

Either way, I'll be picking this set up for sure!",1241395200,14,1236,4.5590909090909095
3851136,5,B00264H4EI,"This was a truly entertaining series from start to finish, sadly cut down before it could even reach its prime.
Nickelodeon did a great injustice by punting this to the wayside, but thankfully, they at least had the courtesy to release the complete series on DVD. If you're tired of the crap the station is airing nowadays (ever since Legend of Korra ended), this is something that'll truly perk you up. Give it a try.",1421884800,,418,4.586666666666667

I wasn't sure it was appropriate for my 8 year old who is scared by Scooby Doo Monsters. We found that she loved it!!

It may not be appropriate for all children that age, and certainly not for younger kids. But We LOVE IT!! My daughter and I quote Charlotte & Vendetta to each other:)
