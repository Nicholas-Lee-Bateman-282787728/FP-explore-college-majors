3704484,3,B001MZ2OO2,"The step workout seem pretty good, but its way too fast and not well coordinated. I have always worked-out at home, I have tons of workout dvd and since I work long hours, I found this works best for me. Ive never had a problem following the instructors from dvd, not even Billy blank Tae boo!! (he gets crazy sometime with em workout video!! lol).. my favoriates are Debbie Siebers' from Slim in six, jane fonda, her step dvd and ab video (excellent for weight loss and staying in shape) and cathe Friedrich just to name a few. Kim's incorporates good steps on her dvd, however, its hard to follow even if you are not a beginner...its taking me sometime to follow her steps and the pace it self its way to fast. Even in the stretch part is the pace its crazy...its hard to catch up or make out the steps...Hopefully this gets better as I become more familiar with the workout...but if you are press for time and you need to squeeze in a 1hr workout before or after work, I'm not sure this is best. I need to be able to follow and know what I am doing...I think Kims dvd makes it difficult for one to follow up, maybe if she went at a slower pace and took the time to demonstrate the steps...dont get me wrong, its not like her dvd is advance for me its NOT!! I've done WAAAAAY tougher workouts than this, its just that she waay to face!! like come on, I didn't even get that last step..can you slow down a little bit!! LOL I don't know, like I said, never had the issue before and I been working out at home with dvds for years...Try Jane fonda steps and ab workouts! its the best, the bad thing is that it only comes in VHS!!",1242691200,3,1627,4.1847133757961785
3704485,4,B001MZ2OO2,"I was a little hesitant to buy the Fit In Your Jeans By Friday DVD series, but now that I did, I am not disappointed.  I am reviewing the ""cardio step"" DVD here:

I am NOT someone who's usually coordinated enough to do ""routine/choreographed"" type workouts.  I was horrible at anything involving dance moves or cheerleading in high school.  I figured this step routine looked like a lot of fun, but I figured I'd probably get totally lost.  I am so happy to say that was not the case.  Kim goes over each step in each combination enough times that it makes it easy to follow.

The music and setting is nice and not overbearing at all.  The total workout is around 50 minutes long, and I was shocked when I realized I was doing the cool down and had done the whole thing.  This workout is literally SO FUN that I didn't look at the clock once to think ""Is this over yet?""

Best part is, while it is fun, I do feel like it's a fairly decent cardio workout.  I know it got my blood pumping and my heart rate up.  I worked up a really good sweat.

All you need is a step and a little bit of space in your home (not a whole lot of space is even needed.)  This DVD is a really fun way to get some cardio exercise into your day.",1241395200,6,1221,4.054393305439331

3704487,4,B001MZ2OO2,I got the abs sculpt DVD and I loved it - decided to get this one too.  This is not as intense as the other one but its way more fun because you are dancing and doing moves that focus on your butt which is my biggest problem area. I love using minimal equipment but all you need is literally a step.,1240185600,11,299,3.8225806451612905
3704488,5,B001MZ2OO2,"First and foremost: These reviews are about products and how beneficial they are, please don't rate these reviews based on how you feel about Kim, even if you haven't used the DVD.

Anyway. In my opinion, these are fun DVD's that get the job done. It really does remind me of the old school 80's workout videos, but this is distinctly modern and gives you a killer workout. It was a plus to me that Kim could look glamourous even as she's sweating and getting fit. It serves as inspiration lol.

Overall, I give this 5 stars because it was challenging, fun and inspirational, which is what we would all like.",1240099200,34,608,4.468468468468468

3704492,5,B001MZ2OO2,I'm not a big fan of KK but have to admit the girls ass is amazing so I figured I'd give his a try. To my surprise it was awesome! Great workout! It is a mix of cardio and lower body toning. My husband noticed results after about a month of doing this work out he said my legs and booty have some definition to them again. There's noticing better than my husband noticing the goodies again.,1367020800,2,390,4.077922077922078

3704494,1,B001MZ2OO2,"Hate to admit it but I really like her workouts with jennifer. HOWEVER THIS DVD SUCKS. It's actually hilarious how poorly put together it is... No time to learn steps and  annoying voice overs that they tried to save the video with. the other two DVDs are great, you get what you're looking for. NOT THIS ONE!",1365465600,,309,4.421052631578948
3704495,5,B001MZ2OO2,"I'm a bit of a step aerobics addict, and I have about 6 DVDs that I really like and alternate between. However, in recent weeks, I've really been favoring this one.
Why? Because it's fun! It's a really fun routine to do, and it's a fantastic workout.

Many other reviewers criticize the cueing in this video, and rightfully so. Cues are often a second or two later than they probably should be, and she often incorporates new moves into the routine before breaking them down for you. This makes the first and second time you go through this DVD a bit challenging. But once you've done it a few times, it becomes easy to follow. And because I enjoyed the workout so much, I unintentionally memorized the majority of the routine after 5-6 workouts.

Let me break it down for you:

Warm Up: The Warm up is a fun step routine, with a little stretching and a few squats in between the stepping

Combination 1: A less intense routine than the other two; It's not too difficult to follow once you've done it once before. My only gripe with this combination is that she replaces a three-leg repeater with what she calls a 'sassy repeater' and is constantly telling you to ""Woo!"" when you do it. I ignore this direction.

Combination 2: A more intense routine that works the booty; Sometimes, I feel like she builds this one too slowly. There are also some fast lunges in this routine that require some balance.

Combination 3: A very fun and intense routine; This is my favorite combination. Tiny complaint: There is a box step in this routine, and it took me a long time to feel comfortable doing it on the step. If you're not comfortable with it, you could easily replace it with a basic step.

Bonus Combination: In this section, you merely run through the 3 complete combinations in succession (3 times). It really gets the heart pumping!

Cool Down: Insufficient, like the majority of workout DVD cooldowns. She goes almost immediately into stretching, instead of gradually bringing down your heart rate first. I usually pause the DVD here and do my favorite cooldown (which I learned form a Cathe Friedrich Step Aerobics video) then hit play and do the stretch with them.

Bottom line - I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in step aerobics, with the caveat that you should be a little patient the first time through.",1356998400,2,2327,4.628640776699029
3704496,5,B001MZ2OO2,"This is one of my favorite workouts! I like to do this one when I want a light, fun, and semi challenging workout. This is a workout that one can't get bored of doing. It's very energetic and quite refreshing!",1356048000,,209,4.25
3704497,1,B001MZ2OO2,"Very disappointed, the video goes extremely fast, I couldn't keep up with it and every time she gave an instruction for a new ""combination"" she was ahead like three steps, so sad because I loved the other two videos",1348185600,,215,4.538461538461538
3704498,5,B001MZ2OO2,"Kim is probably the best sexy women in USA, therefore every girl & every women should watch films with Kim.
In my opinion....
It is only suggestion...",1335225600,,150,4.592592592592593
3704499,5,B001MZ2OO2,"I don't follow news or tabloids, but this video allows me to do a great workout in the comfort of my own home. In the first couple weeks, along with my new diet-I've lost 6 lbs. I'm starting to feel like a Kardashian! Love, love, love! And I haven't even worked up to completing the whole DVD in one setting yet! I just pop it in before work in the morning!",1327449600,,357,4.042253521126761
3704500,5,B001MZ2OO2,"This is a good work out. The choreography is some what difficult, which surprised me since its Kim Kardashian. I'm a big Kardashian fan, so I was happy to find out that it is actually a good work out- I was kind of skeptical.",1323388800,,225,4.136363636363637
3704501,4,B001MZ2OO2,"This isn't the type of workout that I would normally do--not only because of the celebrity instructor, Kim Kardashian, but also because I do usually do step (I actually don't own a full-sized step, so I had to substitute the top portion of my Firm Fanny Lifter).  However, I saw this DVD in the library and was curious about it, so I decided to borrow it.

Although Kim does lead this workout, it was choreographed by veteran fitness instructor Patrick Goudeau.  However, Patrick never actually appears; instead, Kim is featured with two background exercisers in an apartment-like studio setting.  Most of Kim's cuing is performed via voiceover, but she breaks in with live instruction as well.  She does not cue right or left, instead expecting the viewer to keep track of which side is up next at any given time.

The Main Menu offers the following options (approximate times added by me):
*Warm-Up (7 minutes)
*Combination 1 (7.5 minutes)
*Combination 2 (9 minutes)
*Combination 3 (10 minutes)
*BONUS Combination (5 minutes)
*Cool-Down (3 minutes)
*Bonus Features (Series Introduction--Interview with Kim--Behind the Scenes--Meet the Trainer)

Here are my brief breakdowns of the segments:

WARM-UP--Kim gets the heart pumping right away with many classic step moves, including basic step, knee ups, and corner steps.

COMBO 1--This combo includes a rock step to each side, a mambo over the top of the step, a cha-cha-cha/straddle step, and a three-knee repeater adding a fun little ""woo"" turn away from the step.

COMBO 2--I found this combo to have the easiest choreography.  It starts with a fun L-step/punch off the side of the step, the goes to a ""walk the plank"" on the step and lunges off the step, ending with a double knee.  For the final two repetitions, Kim does Combos 1 & 2 together.

COMBO 3--This section contains simple moves such as hamstring curls, knee ups, and kicks, but Kim adds A LOT of directional changes, making the choreography more complicated.  She concludes by running through Combos 2 and 3 together three times.

BONUS--For the Bonus, Kim performs all three Combos together from beginning to end three times through.

COOL-DOWN--This brief segment is a combination of some flowing movements and then a few held stretches for the hip flexors and hamstrings.

I would rate this as a low intermediate step workout.  Because I am not really used to step (and am not particularly good with choreography overall!), I found the choreography to be fairly tricky, but I am guessing that those with more step experience will have no problems here.  In the end, someone who likes Kim and is looking for a fun step workout definitely might enjoy this DVD.",1312761600,6,2678,4.950782997762864
3704502,1,B001MZ2OO2,"I got about five minutes into this the first time I used it. The workout is a good one, but the trainer doesn't explain what the moves are much or how to do them very well, and a lot of them are squat-based or involve you pointing your head somewhere other than the TV. I kept having to swivel my head back and forth from the TV to me and kept missing changes or not performing some of the exercises right because I couldn't see everything that was going on.

I think you'd probably have to watch this entire tape before you tried doing ANYTHING, and that involves more sitting, which is what I'm trying to get away from doing.",1303603200,3,627,4.225
3704503,1,B001MZ2OO2,"I purchased all three of Kim Kardashian's Fit In Your Jeans by Friday DVD's.  To my surprise, I really enjoyed both the Abs Body Sculpt and the Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt.  I thought both were done well with Jennifer Garaldi as the trainer.  Nothing was too hard to do but I really felt the workouts the next day.  The only one out of the three Fit In Your Jeans by Friday DVD's that I truly didn't like was the Butt Blasting Cardio Step.  Kim IS the trainer in this DVD and does NOT do a good job.  There were no real instructions, Kim and the two exercisers just jump in and do their thing and you're supposed to follow.  After trying the other two DVD's in the series, I was excited to work out with the Butt Blasting Cardio Step DVD because I enjoy doing step cardio workouts but this particular DVD I felt it was a total waste of money!  I have some other step cardio workouts (although somewhat old) they are very effective and at least walk you through the moves.  I highly recommend purchasing both the Abs Body Sculpt and the Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt but don't waste your money on the Butt Blasting Cardio Step.  Patrick Goudeau isn't even in the DVD to work out with you.",1297641600,15,1181,4.3031674208144794
3704504,1,B001MZ2OO2,"Anyone who has taken a step class would be very annoyed with this video.  The steps are pretty basic but she does a horrible job calling them out.  It's a voice over and she call them as they are doing it on the video, leaving no time to prepare yourself for what's next. Nothing is done in eight counts so in order to follow and keep up you must memorize it. The only way you will break a sweat from this video is if your heat is cranked.  Bottom line, don't waste your time or money.",1296432000,3,485,4.03125

3704507,5,B001MZ2OO2,"I did not take this DVD seriously when I brought it, just thought is was going to be Kim looking cute making you envy her.... Was I wrong. This (the entire series) was a great set of workouts. I found I needed heavier weights but it is great for people just starting to work out or for people who are just trying to maintain, Even good for teens who need to get started working out. Very instrucational also. The entire series is worth a buy",1289347200,3,441,4.2
3704508,4,B001MZ2OO2,"My fitness level right now is Advanced Beginner, and this was the perfect intensity for me (maximal challenge, but still doable).  The choreography is creative, very very fun, and not very hard to follow.  The exception is a ""box step"" on the step that seems needlessly injury-prone (I just do a regular basic step instead...doesn't change the intensity at all).  But this video is VERY poorly cued...Kim cues 1/2 beat too late through the entire video.  She doesn't demonstrate the moves before you do them either, but I managed to follow 90% the first time through anyway (and got a great workout).  After two or three times doing the video, explanation of the moves is not an issue.  Kim's personality is very uninspiring (and I disagree with the review that said it is not fair to give a rating based on that...instructor personality and attitude is a huge factor in whether you stick with a particular routine).  Overall very good, and I expect to enjoy this routine for a long time and do it often.",1288742400,4,1004,4.702857142857143

3704511,2,B001MZ2OO2,I didn't think there were too many instructions on how to do the moves. I didn't like that you have to use a step. I don't want to have to buy something else along with the DVD. Thank goodness I just rented it!,1281916800,,210,3.9069767441860463
3704512,4,B001MZ2OO2,"I've had the entire DVD set for about 3 months now; and I also just got done reading the 1 and 2 star reviews of this DVD.  It is true, sometimes the voice over does not give you enough warning to do the next move, but if you do this work out long enough (which for me took 1 week) you will memorize the entire work out and it will be fun and worth it!  If you give up too quickly, you won't be satisfied. In the beginning I was a little frustrated, but you can and will memorize it! With any step class you need to take time to recognize the steps and get it right.  I gave this 4 stars only because I think the cool down is a little rushed...other than that, I have lost weight and sculpted my body thanks to all 3 of these DVDs.",1277337600,2,731,3.86
3704513,5,B001MZ2OO2,"This is a really, really great cardio workout!

3704515,1,B001MZ2OO2,"This has got to be BY FAR the WORST exercise video EVER! I got this after purchasing a step. I had a couple of DVDs already but wanted to switch up my routines. The ONLY reason I got this was because on the back it mentioned Patrick Goudeau as an instructor of some sort. I LOVE his step routines so thought I would like this one too. WRONG! First of all, she's narrating most of the video. You hear her talking but when they show her, her lips aren't moving. SECOND.. she goes into moves with no warning or instruction on how to do the moves until she's well into them. This routine was just a MESS! I didn't get 5 mins into before I got frustrated and yanked the DVD out of my player. DO NOT waste your money. Get Kathy Smith, Denise Austin or Patrick Goudeau's REAL step workouts, REAL fitness instructors.",1270684800,7,809,4.259740259740259
3704516,3,B001MZ2OO2,"I've done a lot of step classes before (love them!), and was able to learn all of the routines on this DVD in about 2 or 3 viewings - might have done it faster if the cuing was better.  I would probably rate the three routines as beginner - intermediate levels in terms of the step difficulty and the workout you can get out of it.  I get pretty warm by the end of the ""bonus"" combination (which is the first 3 combinations done all in a row), but I don't break out in a sweat.

I've gone through the workout a couple dozen times as of this review, and I tend to use the DVD more as a reminder than a leader - I add my own flourishes to the steps when I get bored with the first combination, or pick up the pace when Kim is introducing the next step pattern. So I don't notice some of the DVD's shortcomings as much as I use to, and the cuing isn't as misleading once you know the steps.  I really do enjoy the workout on the DVD, Kim's a fun personality and the 3 combinations flow together well.  Put two risers on your step, add a bit more bounce to your movement, and you can get a pretty good cardio workout of of it.

As others have pointed out, the cuing is pretty bad in places - sometimes Kim is already started on the combination as the voice-over instruction (Kim's voice) is just telling you to start.  It was a little distracting the first time when Kim's voice is heard but her lips aren't moving, lol.  I suspect Kim hasn't lead a workout before (but the red head behind her might have?) and that she's being cued off screen by Patrick Goudeau (the trainer).  In other words, don't expect a 100% professional presentation.  The music is pretty soft, and I didn't see a way to turn off the voice-over instructions, either.  I kind of get the impression that this was a vanity moment for Kim.

I probably wouldn't have purchased this DVD by itself, but it was a good buy with the other two - and like I said, with a bit of improvisation, it's still a fun workout! :)",1269129600,3,1979,4.165354330708661

You get a great sweat going and it is more fun that a normal step workout at the gym. Plus I don;t have to drive or stop off at the gym. I can just come home get into my gym clothing and workout!

I don't consider myself a beginner stepper but the step routine is difficult to follow. There is no tuturial or help section or anything like that to show you the moves, plus the camera angle changes very frequently so I am never sure where to look on the screen to see what her feet are doing. The cueing is quite poor and sometimes her voice-over doesnt match up with what her feet are doing which really bothers me. I am planning on trying all of the dvd's a couple more times and hopefully I'll eventually be able to get the routine down and add a couple more stars to my review",1250985600,8,710,4.266666666666667

Now i just need a step equipment and i can't wait to start the workouts. The combinations doesn't seem so difficult (i'm a dancer so that's not nothing new to me) but i believe they will do good for my figure. Sometimes Kim's voice is little anoing but you can get use to it. What matters is that i like Kim's body and i love that this is very modern and fun workout.
As i said can't wait to have my equipment and start the workout!",1247961600,,616,4.133333333333334
3704522,1,B001MZ2OO2,This DVD is not worth the money. First of all it is misleading to tell people they can be in their jeans in a week.  The cueing is off and I think DVD's that have trained professionals with degrees and/or certifications offer a safer workout.  There is a lot more to teaching physical fitness than looking good. No celebrity status can take the place of a degree in exercise physiology.,1246752000,,386,4.5
3704523,4,B001MZ2OO2,"I just received this DVD a few days ago and have already done it twice. I was looking for a really good cardio video that involved stepping since it burns more calories than traditional aerobics and it's a lot more fun too. The DVD itself is really good regardless of any preconceived notions one may have of Kim. I got a really good sweat and it's a perfect length. The only complaint I have it the queing, it could definitely be better. I know that eventually I will get the hang of it because I've been working out long enough to catch on pretty quickly. However for someone who may be new to working out or stepping it can be a bit discouraging not being able to get the moves down quicker,  and the fact that Kim does not indicate which leg to use or she tends to already be in the move when she cues for it does not help matters any. Other than that it's a good legit workout for the masses.",1244073600,2,897,4.155172413793103

3704525,1,B001MZ2OO2,This has to be the wrost workout video I have ever bought.  The video is hard to follow and even harder considering Kim has pretaped her voice so she is not talking most of the time through out the video.  Every once in awhile she chimes in with words of encouragment.  The other videos of hers are better because she is followind along with her trainer.  I would not recommend this video for anyone.,1243728000,4,400,4.364864864864865

3704527,4,B001MZ2OO2,"I really loved this video! i have never done step aerbics in my life so i was a bit behind during the dvd, but it was fun none the less. the only thing i would change is the pace- so that the moves could be learned and then move on to a higher speed.",1243296000,2,250,3.6481481481481484
3704528,3,B001MZ2OO2,"I purchased this product because I am physically shaped like Ms. Kardashian and I believed that this workout dvd would help me to keep my shape.  Needless to say, I watched the dvd before I actually attempted and was disappointed.  Then I actually worked out with the dvd and realized that the cueing was terrible.  I am not a beginner stepper nor am I considered an advanced stepper but the cueing and moves did not allow me to have a good workout.",1243123200,18,449,4.451219512195122

Its pretty good but she does a voice over which is a little lame.... But guess she can't workout and talk at the same time :)",1508803200,,164,3.8529411764705883

8322663,2,B001MZ2OO2,"This is the first DVD I've done in Kim's 'Fit In Your Jeans by Friday' series. It's highly stylised and aesthetically gorgeous, but the workout itself was extremely disappointing. I appreciate the ambition behind it (it's NOT a walk in the park!), but the complicated footwork and absence of any cueing whatsoever detract from the home exerciser getting a good workout. The choreography is so complicated that it's stressful just trying to keep up -- making it impossible to get into it. Ultimately, it's Kim's vanity project. Keep up if you can, but Kim's done nothing to help you get there. Kim's good looks are motivational, but I'm happy to give this workout to my sister as it's not a useful tool for beginner/intermediate exercisers.

If you're a professional dancer who picks up choreography with exceptional ease, knock yourself out...otherwise, not recommended.",1394323200,4,870,5.126760563380282
