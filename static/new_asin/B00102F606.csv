8236608,5,B00102F606,"The homes, gardens and the genuine people who own them are very entertaining and informative.  I've watched these DVDs several times already and will watch them many more times.  While there isn't much that I can use in my Zone 4 High Desert garden, getting a view of some of the best gardens in the world is wonderful.",1354406400,,319,4.482758620689655

8236610,5,B00102F606,"I purchased the 6 DVD ""Great Gardens of England Collection"". I watched some of it and was totally delighted. What an exquisite collection! I decided to order another to give as a gift. In my haste I inadvertently ordered the 4 disc set (Great Gardens of England, Gardeners Views). It is the same as the first four DVDs in the other collection and costs less. It plainly says ""4 DVD Set"". They do have the same photo on the front which did add to the confusion. This was my mistake, however. Both are wonderful collections, but who doesn't want more of a good thing?:-) Just be careful that you click on the set that you really want!",1329868800,8,632,4.410256410256411
8236611,5,B00102F606,"This affordable DVD collection of half-hour segments is an absolute delight for lovers of gardens and nature alike.  The gardens, flowers, and scenery are exquisite.  The photography is first-rate--almost high definition at times--,and the musical accompaniment gently caresses the ear.  What makes these videos more meaningful is the fact that the owners of the gardens themselves provide the commentary and thus speak from actual experience about the  design and care of the gardens.  The infinite variety and beauty of the flowers make you appreciate the wisdom of God's creative work.  Whether you actively watch it or simply have the videos play as beautiful background images, the experience is extremely pleasurable and soothing, especially in our critical and stressful times.",1315785600,24,784,5.546218487394958
8236612,5,B00102F606,"Splendid, simply splendid!  These are the gardens and homes you just dream about. I wish I could have even a portion of just one of them. This series will inspire you, relax you and just make you happy that it is possible to create such works of art. Love it!",1297987200,13,259,4.18
8236613,5,B00102F606,Well worth the money.  Very beautiful and relaxing.  I never tire of watching them (all four discs) !!!,1273795200,15,103,4.666666666666667
