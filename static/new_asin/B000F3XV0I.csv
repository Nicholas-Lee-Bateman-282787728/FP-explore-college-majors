8117036,5,B000F3XV0I,"This short release plus the book GEODIVERSITY (see my review)would make a nice combo to introduce a fairly recent approach to protecting geologically unique landforms for geoscientific, geotourism, and educational purposes. If you can't get to the book, this DVD will provide American preservationists with the bare bones 'visuals' of the whats and whys of geoheritage protection.
As the population of the U.S. soars, this geoheritage option will start looking appealing to American planners, environmental geologists and land conservationsists (who've attempted to focus on protecting biodiversity).",1174608000,3,600,5.988372093023256
