1408028,5,B00005957B,"The TV series is incredible!  They have been threatening to put it out in the US for awhile now, and I have been waiting patiently...

This is a very surreal and silly show about two room-mates, their ridiculous acquaintances, and (to a very minor degree) the sexual tension between them.  Many scenes are spoofs from movies, TV shows and video games... which makes it a pop culture junkies dream.

Hopefully enough people will see these good reviews and raise a stink and get it produced in the US.  If not, you could always try to download them and watch them, but as always consistent recording quality is a problem.",1147132800,6,619,4.6422018348623855
1408029,5,B00005957B,"Ah the good old days. When Friday nights in front of the telly was Friends, Smack the Pony and Spaced.

One of the funniest, most inventive programmes on TV, it spawned the legend that is Simon Pegg and his Shaun of the Dead....but it is Spaced that rocket fuelled him there in the first place.

Full of movie satire and punnage and rich in wit and stupidity, this forerunner for such diverse shows as The League of Gentlemen, Will & Grace and My Family was simply at the top of it's game way before anyone else.

I hope that you, my American cadets, will soon get to experience lift off.",1138924800,8,588,4.327272727272727

The writing is very good, and the acting is top notch.  Pegg is so awesome, and his castmates deliver, bigtime!
The storyline takes you on some great ""twists"" ;-) & turns.
The SFX, lighting and camera work are really good considering their budget wasn't a blank check.

The setting isn't pretty(wasnt meant to be), but it grows on you quickly.

There is something for everyone in this series... action, drama, laughable tears, dogs, guns, and hijinx - often.  :-)

It's a little pricey, but it's worth it as it's one of the best UK sitcoms? ever imho.
Wish it had more episodes, but they always disc' the GOOD ones don't they?

1408308,4,B00005957B,"I just finished watching the entire series via net flix streaming...  It is so demented and amusing, I couldn't stop watching. (Who needs sleep anyway?!?!)

This show follows the misadventures of a bunch of 20-somethings and their completely blitzed-out-drunk landlady, Marsha.  Tim, an aspiring comic book artist, and Daisy, an aspiring writer (complete with typewriter), move into her flat under the guise of being a couple. Tim's best friend Mike wants to be in the army, but got kicked out after trying to invade Paris with a military tank. By himself. Daisy's best friend Twist is ""in fashion"" - so she dresses quite colorfully and quirky. Marsha's other tenant, Brian, is an artist whose subjects are ""pain"", ""fear"", and ""suffering"".

They laze around the house, they get a dog, they go to clubs... they basically avoid their chosen professions... all to hilarious results.

I'm just bummed they stopped at those two seasons. There was so much to explore with the characters. Would Daisy and Tim actually have ended up together? Twist and Brian? Or Marsha and Brian? Or how about Mike and Tim? Would any of them have succeeded as artists/writers? In any event, they made a wonderful, quirky family.

Edgar Wright Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson have a good chemistry that is akin to a basketball team that is in the zone, they might not have the best players, but they share the ball, with the objective to score, the best way possible. Even though it is only 14 episodes total, these are quick short films. I would say that ""Community"" is an American version of ""Spaced"" in fact I'm suprised there haven't been any ""Spaced"" references on the show, I digress. The only drawback to ""Spaced""? Honestly the title ""Spaced"", and thats allright. I don't know what the bbc does in financing their shows, everyone involved in the making of this series, looks like they had a blast. Kudos to everyone involved, also what is really cool, is that you catch ""Spaced"" alumni in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". In all honesty with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" they are extended episodes of ""Spaced"" I don't mean that as an insult.",1333238400,,1023,4.417989417989418
1408310,4,B00005957B,"The box set is a must have for the Pegg / Frost die hard fan set. The first 2 episodes will have you reaching for the remote to fast forward to the next episode. DON'T! Yes, the first 2 are painfully slow, and at times, not funny. Yet, part way through the 3rd you will be rewarded! From then on, the series is tremendous.

Brian is played by Mark Heap from the Brit series Green Wing (he played Dr. Alan Statham). Brian keeps stealing scene after scene. Heap brings forth his talent of physical and bizarre humour that you don't really see in North American shows.

Mike who is played by Nick Frost, is the other scene stealer. Only when he has a larger part (half way through episode 3) does the series really jump. You'll love him in the Paintball and the Robot Wars episodes. Amazing that Heap and Frost are both cast as supporting characters, yet they really carry the scenes.

As typical of a Simon Pegg story, the attentive viewer is rewarded with inside, background gags and references. When you watch the series again and again, you'll understand.",1332288000,,1056,4.518324607329843

1408312,5,B00005957B,"This show is littered with quirky, witty, pop culture filled references and jokes, in a good way! Each character is very well rounded, even in their flaws. I found it almost hard to hate some of them.. almost. It was written by, created by, and starred Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson.

The humour is off the wall. Very cleanly and brilliantly done, never going for the cheap laugh.
The way I like to explain it, most of the time there's a build up you don't see coming then *BAM* joke right there. You're left asking yourself how you didn't see it until it's there. Perfectly executed!

I will admit that at first I didn't enjoy either of the two characters by themselves or together. Overtime you warm up to them after seeing how they function. Daisy has the annoying traits of not being able to focus (sit down and do some work!) or being alone. Both of which drive Tim insane. Tim is very, single minded. He's the typical guy personality. Doesn't worry about too much, doesn't understand women, plays lots of video games and loses himself in those worlds. Over time the all the characters grow and begin to become more independent but still closely relying on each other.

Now I can imagine that many people have seen this or it would simply attracted fans of the Pegg and Frost combo and while I don't disagree it's appealing factor, it might not be quote what you're expecting. It's slightly different from what they are known for (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, etc) although still in the same general genre; quirky, witty, etc. If that's the only reason you plan to see it, it makes me more than a little sad. Their characters friendship is one to remember but I hope it's not the only thing.

This series as a whole is very short, which is upsetting. 14 episodes total split between two series (UK talk for ""seasons""), 7 episodes a piece.

This series is definitely worth taking the time to see.

Recommended: If you love semi-nerdy, quirky, wittiness. Enjoying British humour is a plus.",1331078400,,1995,4.589887640449438
1408313,4,B00005957B,"Daisy Steiner (Jessica Stevenson) and Tim Bisley (Simon Pegg) pose as a ""professional couple"" in order to rent a flat in suburban London.

While the writing partnership of Pegg and Stevenson leaves an indelible mark on the series, Spaced also forms the genesis of the unholy alliance between Pegg, Nick Frost, Edgar Wright and Nira Park that subsequently gave us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz-and-Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B000PE0I5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;and it is fascinating to see the origins of Wright's distinctive directorial style. On the surface, Spaced is a fairly conventional sit-com following the relationships between Tim and Daisy and their friends and acquaintances and follows the format of such offerings as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B002CYIR0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frasier/dp/B002D3ZJD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frasier</a>. Barely beneath the surface, however, is a strong surreal undercurrent which allows the series to explore and parody a host of pop-culture memes, to play fast and loose with the character traits of the protagonists and to stretch the bounds of reality.

Some of these pop-culture refs are explicitly presented and Ep 2.3 includes a glorious homage to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Flew-Over-The-Cuckoo-s-Nest/dp/B00004CX8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</a>&nbsp;(and also has a take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B00028493E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>). Many, however, are either less overt and/or more ""poppy"" so unless you are watching carefully or if you know nothing of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Menace/dp/B00005MFPJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Menace</a>/Jar-Jar schism much will pass you by. While this gives the series some considerable rewatch potential, it also closes some of the comedy off from less culturally aware viewers and dates the series somewhat.

The performances are hugely enjoyable: the ""will they won't they?"" relationship between Pegg and Stevenson is obviously grounded in a close off-screen friendship and drives the plot. Nick Frost is a little over the top as a gun-mad army-barmy type (chucked out of the TA's after he stole a tank and tried to invade Paris), but considering that he took the role with no acting experience and solely on the basis of his friendship with Frost, I suppose he can be forgiven. Mark Heap is, as ever, truly excellent as a struggling avant garde artist and Deakin does the permantly wine-soaked landlady Marsha to perfection. The series is also supported by several not-quite-cameos from such comedy luminares as Peter Seraphinowicz, Bill Bailey, Reece Shearsmith, Kevin Eldon and the like.

This set consists of three wellpacked discs, the first two of which comprise the 14 episodes (two series) and includes an extensive set of out-takes, unused scenes, commentaries, character & cast bios and the like. The third disc is primarily taken up with a two hour documentary on the series so there's plenty to look at.

Overall, Spaced is an interesting and important episode in the history of the Britcom - typical Channel 4 stuff - eclectic, superior, quirky and (most importantly) funny. If it has any faults it is perhaps that it is just a little bit elitist - you really have to be in on the joke to fully appreciate the content - but this shouldn't put you off. Try it - you'll like it

Tim: So what happened last night then?
Daisy: Well we went to see an interesting piece of contemporary theatre, drank an enormous amount of free wine, ate our body-weight in Twiglets and you punched an artist in the face.

Daisy: Why not?

1408314,5,B00005957B,"Of all the shows I've ever watched on television, this show speaks to me as if it were WRITTEN for me. The first series aired in the UK in 1999, right around the time I had turned 30. The Nineties were nearly over, and my Twenties were behind me. All those things I loved in my youth, such as Star Wars, comics, and other such items of geekness, were being pushed to the back of my mind as it had become time to ""grow up"".

Watching this show reminded me that I wasn't alone in the need to cling on to those things that made me who I am. In my mind, ""Spaced"" is the archetype of ""geek cool"". It's a British program that, apart from a few minor idiosyncracies, translates perfectly to an American audience. It's references are not at all subtle and as you watch it, you really seem to get into the heads of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Jessica Stevenson (now Hynes). All their hang ups about ""adulthood"" are there on the screen in spades. It's not completely about ""growing up"" but moreso about friendships and embracing the mundane day to day toils of life as they come.

The characters are rich and well fleshed out within the first series. There are so many memorable moments that I couldn't nearly mention them all here. Having seen Shawn Of The Dead before Spaced, I can certainly see how Pegg and Wright's collaborative relationship developed. It's great to watch Shawn AFTER Spaced and get all the little references and nods to this great series. I even see some similar references filtered into Hot Fuzz.

I was so thankful that this show finally saw it's US DVD release in 2008. The extras are fantastic and the ""Skip To The End"" documentary is a real treat. It gives you an in-depth look into the making of the show, and also what made it so great. It is an ORIGINAL show. ""Coupling"", while funny (Patrick and Jeff mainly), is basically ""Friends"" with a British accent.

If you loved ""Shawn Of The Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", or more US fare such as ""Clerks"" (Kevin Smith's sole true contribution to film)...this is the show for you.",1325116800,,2034,4.459677419354839

Unlike their feature films, the writing here includes Jessica Hines (nee Stevenson) which adds a level of depth and even crass humor missing from the movies.

The DVD's include an extensive documentary on the show, commentaries from the cast and crew, as well as newly recorded ones with the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith. There is even a special subtitle track called the HOMAGE METER that lets you know which movies and TV shows they are spoofing on screen.

So since those two films are a creation of Wright/Pegg/Frost, and Spaced is work of Wright/Pegg/Frost, I was hoping for something as hilarious and witty as Shaun and Fuzz from this show, but the wit, fun and humor just is not there.  Pegg and Frost are fine, but ALL the other characters were horrible, especially the morose downstairs neighbor, Brian (Mark Heap).  Every time he's on-screen, the show just dies.  And the female lead, Daisy (Jessica Stevenson Hynes), is another show-killer.  Just could not stand her.  Honestly, I just don't know why this show is getting such rave reviews on Amazon.

Best DVD purchase ever.  I love this show.  I can watch it over and over and over and laugh out loud with every viewing.  This show is so well written I consider the writers of Seinfeld a distant second.  If I ever hear that they are trying to make an American version of this show I may have to pull a Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back on them and go try to shut it down.

I was not disappointed I laughed so hard I could barely breath and I only laugh that hard unless something is really, really funny.  One of the main reasons I like the show is because it throws so many pop refrencenes at you so many their is actualy a subtitle option that tells you which refrence it is.  Like in one episode a guy is being ambushed boy a pack of teenagers one is at the front and a bunch flank him from the side he says ""clever boy"" a refrence to Jurassic Park (1993).

This series doesn't follow the normal television formula and when you hear Simon, Jess and Edgar talk on the commentary track you find out why.  The BBC Network wanted something new and didn't bother to get involved in the process.  Why can't more television be like that.  I loved all the characters but the one character that was fun to watch was Tyres the bike messenger.

The only bad comment I can make on the series is its only 14 epsiodes.  Every fan of the show wanted more SPACED.

1408421,5,B00005957B,"Before the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost juggernaut started rolling through all of our lives with Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, they did this two-series sitcom that somehow managed to slip through the cracks, at least here in the States. This is a land of cracks though: look at the Grand Canyon. This show is just as brilliant, perhaps even moreso, than those movies and needs to be watched by all fans of British comedy, the above mentioned movies or anyone who is pushing 30 or so and loves great comedy. I say anyone who is pushing 30 because so much of it centers around the daily struggle of life; i.e. the universal fight between dreams and bills. Yet it brilliantly highlights the beauty that can be found in between the big moments, the heavy issues, the days of desperation. It is a very creatively directed, fast-paced, innovative, and astoundingly hilarious show. It is one of those shows that you buy, put on, sit down on the couch and the next thing you know it is 4AM because you could not stop watching.

And by the way, Yanks, British comedies have a long standing tradition of running for just two seasons. It is sometimes frustrating when you just don't want the show to end but it guarantees that they will never ""jump the shark"" and remain works of art instead of money-making drivel.",1248998400,,1299,4.575107296137339

Although there were only two seasons, 'Spaced' was a hilarious show that featured an amazingly talented cast: Jessica Hynes, Nick Frost, Julia Deakin, Mark Heap -- these fabulous actors and actresses all contributed to the hysterical absurdity and humor that is 'Spaced'. Edgar Wright, the same director of 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', two of Pegg's other films, is also the director for the series. The cinematography really adds to the show with all of the fast-paced cutaways and fantasy scenes, and you can see the similarities between Wright's movies and the show. There are tons of Sci-Fi movie references as well, and it's fun to try and figure out which movie they're from. 'Spaced' is a must-have for any Simon Pegg fan. On an interesting note, the series was filmed in 1999 and ran until 2001, and predates 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' by several years.

I thought it was the most funny, honest, accurate portrait of my generation living in Britain at that time. It's well acted, cleverly shot and just about every scene has some homage to the writer's favourite sci-fi and horror flicks. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in my opinion are not nearly as good. I saw myself and my friends in these characters and more than once I was laughing and cringing with embarrasement at the same time, thinking ""god, is this really how we look when we go dancing???"" Err, I hate to say it, but yes, we really did look that ridiculous!!",1225584000,,665,4.459016393442623
1408499,5,B00005957B,"Spaced was a UK sitcom that ran for two seasons in 1999 and 2001 and was tremendously critically acclaimed at the time. The creative team subsequently moved into cinema, creating the hit movies Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and the forthcoming The World Ends, but Spaced remains by far their funniest and most rewarding work.

The series opens with aspiring comic book artist Tim Bisley (Simon Pegg) and workshy writer Daisy Steiner (Jessica Stephenson) both having to find a new place to live. Randomly bumping into one another in the local cafe, they decide to fake being a couple to rent a surprisingly cheap flat in London. The rest of the regular cast is rounded off by their landlady Marsha (a wine-swigging, ex-groupie single mum), Tim's best friend Mike (a failed soldier with a weapons fixation), Daisy's best friend Twist (who Tim sums up as being a ""bit like Cordelia from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and latterly its spin-off series Angel, which is set in LA,"") and Brian, the mildly pretentious artist (specialities: anger, pain, fear and aggression) who rents Marsh's basement flat.

It's a pretty traditional sitcom set-up, but Spaced differs from the average sitcom in two important respects. First, it is directed, shot and edited much more like a movie, with fast-cuts, segues, occasionally impressive special effects and the use of real locations (a nightclub sequence is actually filmed in a proper nightclub, for example, rather than a lame set). Secondly, the series is absolutely overflowing with movie, TV and comic references, some verbal, others visual, some subtle and some pretty outrageous. The DVDs come equipped with a 'homage-o-metre' which tracks these references as they fly past. The homage-o-metre almost explodes during Season 2 when Robot Wars, Fight Club (""No-one talks about Robot Club!"") and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are all heavily referenced in just one episode.

What makes Spaced special is the way these elements are combined with some excellent writing and acting, particularly from Pegg and Stephenson as the leads and the brilliant Mark Heap as Brian (who went on from Spaced to win acclaim in a number of other Channel 4 comedy shows, most notably Green Wing). The comedic situations are also hilarious, such as Tim getting loaded on cheap speed and playing Resident Evil 2 for 12 hours straight, leading to him visualising the world as if a zombie apocalypse is taking place (this was the inspiration for Shaun of the Dead), or the gang's attempts to gatecrash their teenage neighbours' party turning into a Close Encounters of the Third Kind homage. There's also plenty of cameos from other comedians, with Little Britain's David Walliams playing transsexual artist Vulva and The Office's Ricky Gervais putting in a cameo as a slimy newspaper worker, whilst the irrepressible Bill Bailey steals every scene he's in as Tim's comic shop boss Bilbo Bagshot (who retains mild guilt about once punching his dad in the face for saying Hawk the Slayer was rubbish, instead of suggesting they watch Krull and compare the two).

The two seasons are linked by ongoing story arcs, although these are fairly low-key. Daisy and Tim having to fake being in a relationship to appease Marsha is a point revisited several times (leading to awkwardness when both end up in other relationships), whilst Mike is battling to be readmitted to the Territorial Army, having been thrown out after trying to invade Paris with a Chieftain tank. The second season is linked together by Daisy's employment problems, Brian and Twist's romance and Tim's utter hatred and loathing of The Phantom Menace, which lands him in hot water on several occasions (and gives rise to the legendary primal scream of, ""BUT JAR-JAR BINKS MAKES THE EWOKS LOOK LIKE FU**ING SHAFT!"").

Spaced (*****) lasted for just 14 episodes almost a decade ago, but remains one of the funniest, most entertaining sitcoms ever committed to screen. Even now rewatching certain episodes reveals more previously-missed homages to movies or comics, and the series seems to just get better with age. The complete series is available on DVD in both the UK and the USA. The US DVD edition is even more impressive, as it features guest-commentaries from the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Matt Stone.",1225324800,4,4297,5.037974683544304

1408503,4,B00005957B,"It's an odd thing to find out about a television show that only lasted 2 seasons several years ago.  I personally couldn't get enough of this show.

Written by Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and the yet to be released How to Lose Friends and Alienate People) and Jessica Hynes (Son of Rambow), the show centers on two 20 somethings searching for an apartment.  What they find is an ad for an apartment stating that ""Professional Couples Only"" may apply.  The show takes off from there, when they attempt to forge a fraudulent relationship in order to secure a good apartment. That's the basic premise of the show, from there it turns into sitcom like situations, told in a very unusual way.

Now there's obviously things that we Americans won't get right off the bat.  Phrases and slang we aren't 100% used to, but these thing didn't take away from the humor and sometimes insanity of this show.  The show reminded me a little bit of Scrubs in the way it presented thoughts and quick cuts to flashbacks or character's thoughts.  But the humor is centered really around homage to movies, games, and nerdom.  The show is released right around the time of Episode 1... So expect many many jokes around that.... AND ENJOY IT! Added bonus, the man who actually did the voice of ""Darth Maul"" has a part in this series as a bad guy... PLEASE watch out for his lines mirroring Darth Maul's only lines.

Again, I loved this show.  It wasn't quite like Shaun of the Dead, but it was a lot like Hot Fuzz in that it was obviously paying tribute to all the other genre's out there with quoted lines and music.  There are so many small moments when they use one or two lines or just a few actions to mimic a movie, it's extremely well done.  I guess the only other thing I'd have to say is, watch the series once and try to find all the lines from other movies... then watch it again with Homage Meter.

The show surrounds the experiences of a couple who move in together as a matter of convenience when they both need somewhere to live. In their flat (part of a sub-divided house) we find an eclectic group of neighbours and friends. Recurring themes tie most episodes together. Almost every episode is some kind of homily to some kind of Pop Culture phenomenom. Star Wars and Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind are some of the visual and/or dialog references.

So I was pretty sure I had nothing to lose with this set.  The very first episode had my wife and I laughing so hard we almost cried and every subsequent episode had us grinning almost non-stop.  I think it's best not to know much going in, so I won't say more -- just to add my voice to the crowd of those who love this series: check it out and you won't be disappointed.",1221868800,2,1377,5.298165137614679

Fortunately, we now have our region 1 version and I can re-visit Tim and Daisy anytime. What I love most about this show is all the subtle homages to all my favorite movies/tv shows (Star Wars, X-Files, etc.).

1408552,5,B00005957B,"Before there was Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, there was Spaced.  Sadly, I didn't discover this BBC treasure until very recently, only checking it out after the rave things I'd heard about it since it's made it's way to our shores on DVD, and being a huge fan of the aforementioned films and the talent behind them, gave Spaced a shot.  Needless to say, less than two episodes in, I fell in love.  Spaced tells the story of wanna-be comic book artist Tim (Simon Pegg) and wanna-be writer Daisy (Jessica Stevenson); two people who just met and pose as a couple in an effort to rent out a flat.  To make things complicated, they have to deal with their slightly unhinged landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin) and their even more unhinged artist neighbor Brian (Mark Heap).  Loaded with pop-culture references (Star Wars and video games play a huge role, and Tim's tripped out zombie experience is an obvious precursor to Shaun of the Dead), brilliant dialogue, and plenty of undeniably hilarious moments, Spaced is a truly joyous experience.  Even more undeniably true is the fact that Spaced is certainly funnier and smarter than any sitcom you'll find on American network television today (the only show in my opinion to even come close may be Arrested Development), and the special features included in this three-disc set only add to the experience.  All in all, Spaced is a pure comic blast, and if you've missed out on this show but are a fan of anything from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, Spaced is definitely more than worth your time.",1220486400,6,1534,4.701492537313433

My initial thoughts upon watching the pilot were that this was one of the most unusual programs I'd ever seen.  By the time I finished the second episode, I was hooked.  And by the final episosde of Season two, I was lamenting the fact that it was all over.  Despite the characters seeming odd at first, you find that you really do care about them in the finale.  For example, the landlady Marsha (the talented Julia Deakins)who creeped me out a bit at first ends up being fully fleshed out and when her feelings are hurt at the end, your own heart breaks for her.

The finale is complete and brings everything to a wonderful full circle.

And what do we get for a show that was under the radar for so many people?  We get all the episodes, plus copious extras and commentaries that are more than worth the money.  The 2007 Q&A reunion with the cast is worth watching, my only criticism being that it's a long shot held the entire time.

1408572,5,B00005957B,"Finally, here is Spaced in the USA.  This genius show eluded the US shores due to various copyright issues.  Here is the full unblemished UK Britcom in its entirety.  The show screams genuis with it's multi dimensional characters, pop culture references, self referential humor, and very carefully placed sight gags.  It rises above its contemporary Brit coms by shedding the formula with a filmic quality and lack of canned laughter.  Like ""The Office,"" this is UK comedy done differently.  This is where Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost started before Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  Fans of those films NEED to watch Spaced.

The success of the show has much to do with the characters carved out by Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson.  Breaking a trend from many sitcoms, the lead chracters Tim and Daisy are not well to do successful twenty somethings living it up in New York or a similar locaiton.  They are somewhat slacker twenty somethings barely getting by, referencing pop culture, playing video games, and totally giving in to geek/fanboy culture.  In many ways Spaced is not about the exciting happenings in the lives of Tim, an artist, and Daisy an aspiring (sort of) writer, but rather about the funny things in the everyday going ons of their lives and the lives of their unusual friends.  For all the odd references and quick film quality shots, Spaced has that extra feeling of reality as these are easy characters to relate to.

But it's oh so much fun.  Every shot is filled with gags and references, be it ""The Shining,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" or hilarious scenes such as a depressed Tim intentionally drowning Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.  It's an unbelievably well crafted comedy that is rarely a miss.  The supporting characters are great too like the military minded Mike, played by Nick Frost or the curious ""artist"" Brian. There's something for everyone.

As the DVD goes, this is the Spaced DVD to end all Spaced DVDs.  For owners of the UK DVDs, this release surpasses them as each episode has an additional commentary by film makers like Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino.  They're often way off topic, but highly entertaining as these are film makers watching the shows as fans (and in many cases now friends of the creators).

These shows are endlessly watchable.  If there's any flaw it may be that sometimes the references get too smart or too obscure.  The homage o meter subtitle will help for that.  Overall, a hugely enjoyable show.  I doubt anyone will find reason to ""skip to the end.""",1219795200,,2527,4.7695852534562215
1408573,5,B00005957B,"This is a prime example of raw talent waiting to be discovered.  5 years before the amazing 'Shaun of the Dead' Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, & Nick Frost made the most intelligent, referential, and hilarious British television show since 'Monty Python'.  Unfortunately it only ran for 14 episodes.  After making the first 2 series on a shoestring budget and working themselves to exhaustion Simon, Edgar, Nick, & Jessica Stevenson (Cowriter & star) had to move on to bigger and better things.  I love 'Shaun of the Dead' and their follow up 'Hot Fuzz' but I would have also liked to have seen 'Spaced' run for 2, 3, even 10 more series.

1408600,4,B00005957B,"Okay, first things first: If you loved Simon Pegg's movies SEAN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, then you'll enjoy SPACED. If not - then it's still an intriguingly funny, if flawed, look at young adults forming families of choice as opposed to families of birth while trying to make it in the arts. Be advised, though - it's very much what the British call a ""post-watershed"" show (that means they drop the F-bomb repeatedly, openly drink and use drugs socially, and engage in casual sex), so it's not for anyone under 16.

Pegg plays Tim, an aspiring comic book artist who's just broken up w/his live-in girlfriend and needs to find a place to live. Jessica Hynes (here under her maiden name ""Jessica Stevenson"") plays Daisy, an equally-aspiring journalist desperate to get out of her squatter's flop. They meet, they agree to pretend to be a couple in order to rent a reasonably-priced apartment for an eccentric landlady...and this is where the series DOESN'T go where you'd expect it to. Tim and Daisy, though they become close friends, NEVER become lovers, nor is there any hint they ever will, as the series becomes about their (often surreal) interactions with their friends and neighbors, and the friends' and neighbors' interactions with each other.

But enough of the regular sitcommy stuff - what about the wacky pop culture references? Oh, Pegg and Stevenson bring it there - in spades! Seems nobody can have a conversation with, or about, each other without referencing some movie, comic, television show or videogame - and the series mercilessly rips into horror movies, zombie films, SAY ANYTHING, performance art, porn, cop shows, war epics....

Again, if you're a Simon Pegg fan you'll love it - if not, watch it for how series writers Pegg and Hynes bring out the often-artless attempts of self-absorbed creative people to reach out to one another in love and friendship.",1219104000,3,1882,4.893416927899686

This is much due to a music licensing issue that thankfully got resolved. Since then, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright have teamed to make two phenomonal films in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and garnered acclaim on this side of the pond. It's funny that the show that launched their careers (as well as the hilarious and talented co-creator Jessica Hynes nee Stevenson) is just now getting released here, where their recent work will likely be a selling point of the DVD! This is what comedy should be- surreal, sans laugh track or a studio audience, and genuinely funny based on situations that don't feel forced.

And after reading the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one who's been inspired to do this!  It's utterly original, and it's *that* good.

Why American TV stations have not been airing this since its creation in 1999-2000 baffles my mind.  There may be odd references to British things that the average American doesn't ""get"", but I think too many people underestimate the average Yank's ability to understand, appreciate, and learn from other (pop-)cultures.  Too orangey for crows? I think not!

Nothing is dumbed down in Spaced, and this is one of the many things that makes it an uncompromisingly sharp, stellar comedy.  The jokes come hard and fast so there's plenty for everyone to laugh at, but there are several levels of comedy/satire/homage-ing going on at the same time which makes it all the more delightful and devotion-inspiring for those that 'get' it.  For example, one entire episode is a take off of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and I only realized this the second time I watched it.

The DVD is chock-full of extras, including hilarious outtakes, deleted scenes, trailers, commentary over the episodes, and an ""homage-o-meter"" you can switch on in the language subtitle options so that you don't miss any of the many geeky pop-culture references!

The pop culture references spill out so quickly and sometimes so casually, you burst out laughing several moments AFTER the reference, when you suddenly ""get it"".

I'm not sure why studios/companies always seem to underestimate Americans' ability to process, translate and yes, even appreciate cultural differences. We Americans DO catch on to cultural nuances. No need to dumb things down for us...I hope they NEVER try to create an ""American"" version of SPACED...you just can't top this classic original. Let it be!!!

Definitely buy this DVD if you've ever seen the Bravo telecasts...you'll be in for a happy surprise. Also, the bonus features are pure fried gold. My favorite show...ever. ""Dance, Colin! Dance.""",1217030400,3,1422,4.819672131147541

The series holds up really well to multiple viewings to catch all of the little movie references and jokes. The DVDs themselves are covered by lovely artwork featuring the characters as caricatures of themselves and the packaging is good quality. Like all Wright/Pegg DVDs the bonus features are excellent and well worth the cost. They include the homage-o-meter, raw footage, outtakes, deleted scenes, as well as the 2007 BFI Q&A panel, and TWO alternate endings (one in the Skip To the End doc and one in the extra deleted scenes on disc 3).

Goodfellas, Manhattan, and later on everything from Pocahontas to Pulp Fiction and the Matrix, and only in half an hour.

Quite simply, Spaced is magic.  It's probably my favorite Britcom, and that's saying something as I am a bit of an anglophile.

Most people will probably discover it after Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and I have to agree that if you love either of those movies, Spaced will not disappoint.  I don't really have anything else to say that one of the other reviewers hasn't already said, but I'm also distracted by the fact that I'll have it in my hands in eighteen days.  My excitement is tangible and distracting.

First of all, I watched all of series 1 + 2 over the weekend. It was hilarious from start to finish, though they kind of jumped the shark for series 2, meaning it was a bit more outlandish, but still funny.

Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner are strangers who meet at a cafe. He is a cartoonist who works at a comic book store, and she is a freelance writer. They are looking for a place to live and see an ad in the paper for a flat, apartment to us Yanks :), but the ad says professional couple only. So they pretend they're together and hilarity ensues. But this gag is played down and not really integral to the series.

What spaced is really about is  Tim and Daisy's interaction with their flat-mates and the landlady and the funny situations they find themselves in.

I bought this same product from amazon.co.uk. a couple of weeks ago. It was 10.48 which is about $22, shipping is like $6 and you can get it in about a week. FYI, It's region 2 and PAL, but my dvd player supports that, yours might not.

Highly recommended, but keep in mind that you will need a player that is both region-free AND can play PAL discs (Philips DVP642 can do both, and is cheap).

On a side note, don't bother ordering from Marketplace sellers.  Go to amazon.co.uk and order from them directly.  Even with shipping from the UK it will still be a lot cheaper - I got this for 14 pounds with shipping, which is less than $30.",1200441600,,799,4.286666666666667
1408678,5,B00005957B,"it really is quite amazing that 'spaced' hasn't seen a proper u.s. release.  like most everyone else who has it, i bought a region 2 copy from amazon.co.uk and had it in about two weeks [shipping is also VERY reasonable].  of course you WILL need a region-free dvd player [i, tried unsucessfully, various internet media players like vlc, for example. i also tried to use mac the ripper to burn myself a region-free copy -- totally legal if you buy it, as it did -- but alas, that didn't work either].

when i first heard about 'spaced,' i feared it would be like all those lame british comedies you usually see on PBS -- set in a department store of some kind, a really bad laugh track, stuffy humor, etc.  i really had no idea what to expect, but i bought in anyway because a trusted friend couldn't stop talking about it.  fortunately, my fears were completely unfounded.

the premise is fairly simple, as has been adequately described in other reviews. suffice to say that there's plenty of humor to be found in a relatively simple setup.  but big kudos to simon pegg, jessica stevenson and edgar wright for finding the madness, insanity, and hilarity in the every day and the mundane.  the laughs come pretty fast and furious, thanks the sharp dialogue, rapid-fire exchanges, frenetic editing and zoonms and unique camera angles. but most importantly, the two leads are so darn likeable that you find yourself pulling for them almost instantly. simon pegg drips [his facial expressions alone are almost worth the price of admission alone] and jessica stevenson ooze charisma in large drops.

if you're a fan of so-called pop culture, 'spaced' is a dream. simon pegg's 'tim' drops more references than you can shake a stick at. you get odes to baywatch, the a-team, close encounters of the 3rd kind, the x-files, various comic book heroes [the flash, batman, etc], and, of course, plenty of homages to star wars -- including an hilarious dog rescue episode in which our heroes adopt the 'code names' han, leia, luke, chewie and jabba.

the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, too. twist, the fashionista who works at a dry cleaners'; brian, the tortured artist who lives downstairs; marsh, the alcoholic landlady; and mike, the 'territorial army' reject and tim's best friend who once stole a tank and tried to invade paris. tim and mike's scenes together are priceless, as is the entire paintball episode [#4, 'battles.']

it's a shame that 'spaced' lasted a mere 14 episodes over two seasons.  but at the same time, they cast and crew kind of captured lightning in a bottle. they came, they saw, they conquered.  you make your point and get out while the gettings good.

I love ""SPACED"" even more than both of the movies (which are great), maybe because of co-creator Jessica Hynes' added female point of view? Whatever the magic ingredient it is, it makes for very relateable and endearing characters. That same sense of humor evident in the movies is very much on display here, but because this is a series you get many more hours to know these characters. And you'll enjoy every minute. Pegg's Tim Bisley is a Sci-Fi lovin' pushing-thirty nerd, but there isn't an ounce of parody, he's a real person. Jessica's Daisy Steiner too is a terrific character devoid of the typical sitcom shortcuts. Around these two is a stellar supporting cast inclduing Nick Frost's military-obsessed Mike, Mark Heap's struggling artist Brian, Katy Carmichael's oblivious Twist and the marvelous Julia Deakin as the alcoholic landlady Marsha. Each episode is a gem, and it adds up to a group of people you don't want to stop knowing. The documentary included in the three-disc set, ""Skip to the End"", is very comprehensive as both a behind-the-scenes and a history of the show (as well as providing a nice little CODA as to what may have happened to Tim & Daisy!).

What does an American have to do to get a hold of this fantastic British comedy.....It's been approx. 7 years sinces it's first aired, yet still so difficult to get a hold of.  Am I not looking in the right place...Do I have to look elsewhere?  Thanks to Trio and BBC America, This is one the few wonderfully hilarious British series I have seen in a long time.  It's 2006 already...where are the DVD's of this show?",1154304000,3,507,4.361702127659575
1408717,5,B00005957B,"This series (though only two seasons) is brilliant!  It is by far my favorite british series -- yes, I'm even including the Office in there.  My friend got my hooked on it when I was living over there, and now I'm left spaced-less, which is not a good situation to be in.

Seriously though, the writing and acting is spot on.  It often spoofs well known pop culture, and always does so without being over-the-top or cringe worthy like some spoofs.  And the originality of the series is unrivaled -- Simon Pegg is brilliant!  Be sure to catch his zombie romance spoof, Shaun of the Dead.

Please please please, I beg of the powers to be, bring both seasons of Spaced to the American audience!  I'm tired of my friends only seeing Keeping Up Appearances on PBS and saying British comedy isn't that funny -- well they haven't seen Spaced yet...",1149120000,21,841,4.52317880794702

7933866,5,B00005957B,"I had never seen the show and the DVDs are near enough impossible to find. But my English girlfriend always raved about it and I'm glad she did. It's very interesting to see the start of Wright's career and him developing his unique style.

Aside from the content of the show, the packaging is great and there is some wonderful artwork inside.",1505260800,,343,4.532258064516129

Had heard many great things about this series and hoped it would stream in the US by now- alas my patience wore thin and I purchased the DVD set. My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner,1502496000,,283,4.163636363636364
