8463357,5,B005AKIMT6,Before I wrote this review I took the time to read the other review to see what others have thought and see if they have had the same unbelievable results...... And yes both Shawn and Nicole make this video perfect from the multiple angles  to slowing down and explaining the more technical parts. Both what to do and what not to do. This video was great im going out dancing tonight and can't wait to try these moves out. I frequently get asks where do I dance for what company and when I tell them that I am just a guy that goes out when he can to dance and have fun they don't believe me'.... (Huge ego booster by the way thanks for that one Shawn).But I alway tell them how I got to be such a good dancer and would recommend this set of video's to every one!!!,1447286400,,764,4.093333333333334

Volume 8 takes the cake with two of our most favorite moves yet.  We cannot put into words how impressed we are with these DVDs from Shawn and Nicole because they are just THAT GOOD.  Everything is done step by step and they often show you each step from a different angle so there is no way to goof it up.  Highly recommend Volume 8 and all the moves videos shawn has put out.  Cant wait to try out the other two advanced videos but really, how much more advanced can it get?  We will soon find out!",1399507200,,617,4.016393442622951
