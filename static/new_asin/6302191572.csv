7822277,5,6302191572,"This film is incredible. If you have any idea what it takes to climb mountains in todays modern gear, this movie documents the monumental effort of these men 50 years ago.",1370131200,,171,4.548387096774194
7822278,4,6302191572,"This is an important historical video from a number of perspectives.  First, it is the video log of the first ascent of Everest by Americans.  Second, it is the first National Geographic film ever broadcast on TV and as such is the granddaddy of what today is a huge sub-industry within the National Geographic organization.

This movie is a direct print from a somewhat aged copy of the original movie.  There's a lot of film scratches, dust, occasional audio hiccups etc. that made it onto the video.  If you are expecting a high quality transfer you'll be sadly disappointed.

My opinion is that this is a video that is very deserving of a quality digital re-mastering and can benefit from the addition of any additional footage from that expedition that might still be available.  I'm not sure who owns the rights to this film, but this would be a worthy project for National Geographic to undertake.

That said, if you have any interest in the history of Everest, mountaineering, the Himalayas or even the National Geographic library this is one video  to add to your collection.  As an old camping/climbing gear junkie I found many of the shots fascinating.  Seeing what gear was used and how it was used 50 years ago is fascinating.

One interesting tidbit.  Most if not all of the outer-wear the climbers used - goose down jackets, pants, mittens, even sleeping bags, was produced by Eddie Bauer in Seattle.  Virtually everything you see Jim Whittaker wearing in that iconic shot of him taken in the summit, his ice axe held aloft with the two flags streaming in the wind, was made by Eddie Bauer.  There was a time, long ago, when Eddie Bauer made serious expedition-grade gear.  Of course this was long before the company was sold off and became today's purveyor of cheap 'lifestyle' gear sold to mall rats across the US.",1370044800,2,1831,4.728706624605678
7822279,5,6302191572,A spectacular video journey. I knew some of the climbers who were treated at Bethesda Naval Hospital. I would recommend anyone who is interested in Everest to also read Into the Silence by Wade Davis. Puts everything into perspective,1361750400,,233,5.0
7822280,5,6302191572,"This is the DVD of a now old movie of the first American expedition to climb Mt. Everest, over 50 years ago.  The narration by Orson Welles is clear, concise, informative and mildly exciting.

I had the privilege of getting to know several members of that expedition (oh no, my age is showing now!):  Norman Dyhrenfurth, Jim Whitaker, and Willie Unsoeld.  I admire them all and the era of mountaineering that brought to an end the accepted virtues (though not always well practiced) of personal sacrifice, group cooperation, refined skill, effort almost beyond belief, humor in the face of real danger and the general conception that mother nature holds the power in the assault of human arrogance.

As someone wise once remarked, no one comes down from the great high mountains a conquerer, but rather returns as a grateful survivor.

This is a concise movie that does not draw out nor trump up the hazards of going high.  It is the best of the National Geographic Society primarily because of the detailed and honest writing of James Ramsey Ullman, the virtuous performance of the director (also the primary cinematographer), the lead climbers, the devotion of sherpas, the skilled companions who worked together for a nation that often fails to follow suit.

View it and appreciate the wonderful people whose lives are briefly told in film.",1341187200,2,1343,4.937777777777778
7822281,5,6302191572,"This is the story of the first American ascent of Everest in 1963. Jim Whittaker and Nawang Gombu made the summit via the south col route on May 1. Barry Bishop and Lute Jersted followed on May 21, with Lute taking the first moving pictures from the summit, which appears on this video. Barry and Lute then waited for Dr. Tom Hornbein and Willie Unsold, who were coming up the unclimbed west ridge, but left the summit around 3pm. Tom and Willie reached the top at around 6pm, stayed for 15 minutes, then headed down the south col route following Barry's and Lute footsteps. They joined forces around 9pm, continued down the ridge until around midnight when darkness and exhaustion forced a halt. On all but a handful of nights in a whole year, they would have died in the wind. But this night was calm and still, and they survived. Tom and Willie made the first traverse of Everest after reaching a point of no return on their ascent of the west ridge. This climb is now part of mountaineering history and the film is a classic.",995673600,3,1029,4.4787234042553195
7822282,4,6302191572,"This is the film of the first American ascent of Everest in 1963, and  features the very first film footage taken of Everest's summit. More than  that, it chronicles not only Whittaker and Gombu's reaching the top, but  Tom Hornbein and Willie Unsoeld's historic and brave ascent of Everest's  difficult West Ridge. Old, and sometimes dated, but from a time when  climbing was much less commercialized, and seemingly much more daring and  dramatic. Narrated by Orson Wells.",969062400,2,473,5.077922077922078
