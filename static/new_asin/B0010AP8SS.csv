8652847,5,B0010AP8SS,"Oh wow...I totally disagree with the previous reviewer! This DVD is exceptional because it breaks down the stroke into its basic key elements and then shows how they all fit together. The DVDs are full of excellent underwater video. Brendan is an exceptional swimmer and is used in this video as an example. This video is about swimming and is not meant to be a Hansen swim biography. Glenn Mills is swimmer who is extremely knowledgeable about swimming technique. He simply knows his stuff. This DVD helped my 10 year old son as well as myself improve our breaststroke technique. I will absolutely be buying more of the GoSwim DVDs. Good stuff!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-Swim-Breaststroke-with-Brendan-Hansen/dp/B0010AP8SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go Swim Breaststroke with Brendan Hansen</a>",1247356800,,841,6.016666666666667
8652848,1,B0010AP8SS,"This video was not what I expected. I was expecting Brendan to give at least a basic explanation of his training as well as tips on training and technique. What I got was video of Brendan swimming with some other guy narrating. The narration was a vague explanation of what makes Brendan Henson a good breaststroke swimmer. I honestly feel I could have just watched Youtube videos of Brendan swimming and got just as much out of it.
If you are a Brendan Hansen fan and just want to see him swim and talk in a few small interviews (they give no insight into how to become a better breaststroke swimmer), then buy this video.",1239753600,,623,4.426086956521739
