1918234,5,B0000CBL87,"THE PACT OF SILENCE is an astonishingly fine film that is one of the best French murder mysteries/gothic stories since DIABOLIQUE.  The story is complex and unravels slowly and tensely.  Gerard Depardieu (in one of his finest performances) plays a priest/physician with a past of his own who happens to be called to care for a young Carmelite nun with bizarre, recurrent abdominal pain and anxiety atttacks.  Though the Carmelite order does not accept contemporary medicine, Depardieu follows the young nun, makes discoveries about her parents and finds that she has an identical twin sister who is in prison for alledgedly murdering a child under her care while baby sitting 10 years ago.  There is a Mother Superior (the inordinately gifted actress Carmen Maura) who cares for the young nun (Sarah) and holds to beliefs that herbal medicine, especially as practiced by a shamanist women in Brazil, is the only means of curing Sarah's ills. At this point Depardieu's priest is commited to investigate the source of his patient's pain and is defrocked as priest for his efforts. Sarah's twin (Gaelle) is released from prison, and in fear and desparation finds succour in the kindness of Depardieu's Priest.
Once the twins know of each other's whereabouts the mystery grows thicker and the resolution of the impact of the 'pact of silence' between the twins is the climax of this thrilling film.  To say more would lessen the effect of the movie.  There is a powerful statement about taking responsibility for one's past, and the power of love that is the source of healing, and some very interesting insights into the Catholic Church and its Orders. Beautifully filmed in Paris and Portugal, the scenery and camera effects are majestic, the use of flashbacks to provide the past history of each of the characters is subtle and very well done, and the acting is homogeneously excellent.  The twins are played by young French actress Elodie Bouchez and her ability to find the separate identities in the identical twins' personalities is uncanny.  In French with excellent subtitles.  The music score (ranging from Pergolesi's ""Stabat Mater"" to contemporary street music) is well realized.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1068336000,8,2208,5.091412742382271

7998837,4,B0000CBL87,"Good movie to build french vocabulary and comprehension. English subtitles actually very good for students learning french and wanting to follow the quick moving pace of this movie.  Would recommend watching it with french subtitles and not english.  You can always lookup the words you do not know, it's really the best way to learn.",1394668800,,334,5.054545454545455
7998838,4,B0000CBL87,"Just to clear up some confusion about the ending of Pact de Silence: The sister who dies after the fall is Gaelle, because you can see the blood in her left hand while holding her surviving sister's hand lying on the ground, after she killed the journalist. So the former nun, Sarah, lives on happily with Joachim, and they even have a child, shown in the final scene.",1339200000,,368,4.426470588235294
7998839,2,B0000CBL87,"THE PACT OF SILENCE is a much ado about nothing film.  Starring Gerard Depardieu as Father Joachim and Elodie Bouchez in a dual role as twin sisters Sarah and Gaelle, Graham Guit's directed ""thriller"" is really a slow moving build up and unraveling of clues that, once you get to the conclusion, you just say ""What's the big deal?"" and move on.  Two of my favorite actors in one pretty dull film that tries to be sophisticated and unique, but ultimately is neither and seems intentionally confusing to no point.  No recommendation. No DVD special features. Unenlightening commentary.",1206576000,3,583,4.928571428571429
7998840,4,B0000CBL87,"For an obscure European drama this is actually pretty entertaining.  I wish there was more disclosure in the beginning, because each time you have identical twins, without introducing some sort of background, you are bound to cause confusion.  The movie was not about the bond between two sisters.  It was about a sacrifice that young children are sometimes willing to make for their parents.  When Gaelle sent her mother and her sister away and said that ""The  strongest one must go to prison"", that just sent shivers down my spine.  The fact that the girl was willing to spend 14 years in jail for her mother's crime and not complain or elevate herself to martyrdom is truly blood-chilling.  In this world most people are blamers.  They are quick to point fingers and say: ""He/she did it!""  It's really rare to find someone who is willing to bear the punishment intended for another person.  In that way, this is a very pro-Christian movie, even though the Joaqim ends up abandoning priesthood to be with the woman he loves.",1137801600,,1026,4.745762711864407
7998841,4,B0000CBL87,"Note: French with English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai subtitles.

An attractive but troubled young Carmelite nun named Sarah (Elodie Bouchez) falls ill and the physicans responsible for her care are unable to correctly diagnosis the cause. Thinking it maybe psychological in nature Father and Doctor Joachim Ferrer (Gerard Depardieu) is summoned to investigate.

Father Joachim finds himself irresitably drawn to the vulnerable Sarah and continues to delve ever deeper into her pain and delusions even after Church authorities demand that he cease treatment and leave her to the care of the convent.

Determined to solve the mystery, he becomes more detective than doctor or priest and eventually discovers that Sarah's medical problems are somehow psychically linked to her twin sister Gaelle who was just recently released from prison.

There is something evil afoot between the syblings and only Father Joachim is in a position to save the innocent. Will he be willing to risk his priestly vocation to uncover the truth?

'The Pact of Silence' is an exciting murder mystery/romance that will command your attention to the very end. Gerard Depardeau is excellent, as is the very lovely Elodie Bouchez in the dual role of Sarah and Gaelle. One of my favorite French films!",1134000000,,1292,5.252427184466019
7998842,3,B0000CBL87,"Perhaps if the ending had been different I would have rated this film much higher.  The acting was superb and the plot (3/4 of it anyway) was fascinating and kept me glued to the screen.  However, I agree with other reviewers who found the script too deliberately confusing for it's own good.  It did not need to be so ambigious ALL of the time to keep the mysterious secret of the identical twins.  The immediate romance made sense (sidetracking the pursuit of the ""secret"", the pursuit of experiencing ""real life"" as the Priest invites the one twin to do, as well as furthering the view of redemption through love) but it seems to unravel once all of the main characters arrive at one place at the same time.  The twins ending up wearing the same clothes just to keep the audience confused as to their real identities was way too unrealistic and somewhat ruined it for me not to mention that the climax scene made no sense at all AND this is despite my knowing which twin was which (since one twin greets the other when they reunite and gives away the name of each twin at the hand holding scene).  Why would Sarah be mad at Gaelle??  The reason she states is unrealstic and unexplainable especially when you discover the truth!  Highly recommend the film only if you can overlook some major flaws and concentrate instead on the flawless acting and intresting themes of religion, redemption and the different meanings of love.",1116720000,8,1428,4.616600790513834
7998843,3,B0000CBL87,"At first, I found this film rather slow but ended up quite gripping.  And then it ended.  It left many unanswered questions that really would have made this a deeper, more substantial film.  While I enjoyed the film, it could definitely have been less mysterious than it was.  I would likely have to watch it again to see if I missed something.",1111017600,4,344,4.5
7998844,2,B0000CBL87,"A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words ""screel deen"" that the nun screams in her agonies?

The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.

BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits.",1101686400,9,967,4.819277108433735
7998845,4,B0000CBL87,This film is a great example of the excellent French/European filming. Gerard De Paurdiou is one of the most incredible performers I've seen. This film is a little confusing because of the lack of time to explain everything's going on but we can figure it out step by step in our minds. The actress playing the role of the twin sisters is superb. Is a suspense thriller that will surprise you as you would never imagine. Highly reccomended.,1076198400,2,440,4.653846153846154
