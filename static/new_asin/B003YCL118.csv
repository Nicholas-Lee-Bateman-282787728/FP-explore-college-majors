8408987,5,B003YCL118,"This concert DVD is a true delight. Excellent sound and video through out. John continues to explore and share his
musical vision and guitar expertise. As close to ""perfect"" as it gets!",1352073600,,185,4.8125
8408988,5,B003YCL118,This is a great video. Very well recorded. You always expect Scofield to sound great and he certainly does on this with his original style. He's just a beautiful musician. The group plays together well listening to and complimenting each other in the deepest way and it's obvious that they're serving the music. A perfect musical conversation by four great musicians.,1342137600,2,367,5.032786885245901
8408989,5,B003YCL118,"I am follower of Mr Scofield's music and his sideman incursions from the late 70s. This is what I would call ""a jazz fusion masterpiece"" where the interpretation of the std ""My foolish heart"" deserves special attention for the arrangement based on mostly in a temperate melody line than that of an intricate harmony and chord progressions tipically seen in the majority of the modern jazz guitarrists. For those who loves jazz guitar and as I do, enjoy the once in a while, ""ins"" and ""outs"" of key incursions, that makes Mr. Scofield himself one of his distinctive trademarks as guitar interpreter, I strongly recommend this blueray. It pays back.",1311465600,5,647,4.890909090909091
8408990,5,B003YCL118,"i'm watching it at this moment. it's beautiful music, i'll watch it several more times too. i'm a fan of scofield and jazz music in general. plus bill stewart is one of the best drummers out there now. if you're a fan of this genra it's a great escape from life for an hour or so.",1296345600,,280,4.017857142857143
8408991,5,B003YCL118,"Great playing, great quality, stunning blu-ray picture. Love it, only gripe is the 5.1 mix seems like the guitar is mixed too loud in the center channel, but the 2-channel stereo mix sounds fantastic.",1293753600,2,200,4.911764705882353
