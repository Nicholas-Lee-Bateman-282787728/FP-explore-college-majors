5159086,2,B008FYZHLK,"As I was watching this particular volume (vol. 5)I noticed some things that made no sense at all. Showing excerpts from previous episodes that hadn't occurred. Then going back to air dates on IMDB, I realized the episodes were out of sequence.

5159087,3,B008FYZHLK,"I am BEYOND disappointed with this release.

The episodes on the DVDs are not in the order they were aired, they are in the order they were produced. So if you watch them in the order they're in on the DVD, you're going to skip around a lot and be extremely confused with the plot-line. At one point, the ""last time on the Avengers"" segment actually SPOILED some major points for us before we realized that the episodes were out of order.

When studios release shows like this, it only tells me one thing: they don't give a crap about the show. They don't care about the fans, they're just putting some mess down on a DVD and calling it a day in an attempt to earn some money.

I was very happy that the season starts off with a cameo from the Fantastic Four. That was a nice surprise! Then we got a cameo from the Guardians of the Galaxy later on, another happy surprise.

But the jumbled up episodes completely ruined this release for me, especially since I can't even watch the episode ""Behold... The Vision!"" yet, as it's episode 14 of the season, but on the DVD they have it as episode 9. I'm putting a hold on watching it until Volume 6 comes out to finish the rest of the season, so I can watch the episodes in order.",1349049600,27,1224,4.240343347639485
5159088,5,B008FYZHLK,"This has to be the best super hero animated show Marvel has ever produced.  I happened to read that this is the last season.  Are they going for the kid friendly streamlined version in the new series?  Chris Yost is the story editor on this series.  He has done a wonderful job of selecting the right stories to integrate into the cartoon version.  I hope he is the editor on the new series.  His work on X-Men: Wolverine, was the best writing I have seen in Marvel animated films.  I listened to all his commentary on each episode.  However, the Avengers DVD sets don't have any commentary.

If you like the comics and the movie, you'll love the series.  It takes the best elements of the mythology into the modern age of Marvel Comics. I was very skeptical before viewing the first episode.  All my concerns were put to rest after watching though.  The characters are all true to their comic book roots.  There are so many Avengers stories left, I hope that the same team is on the next series.",1348704000,7,996,4.43646408839779
5159089,1,B008FYZHLK,"i for one am very disappointed in this dvd release. they are not giving us the episodes in the way they were originally aired on disney xd. we get 13 episodes in which the 13th episode in the release is ""secret invasion"" when in fact the 13th episode was ""along came a spider"". they have ""behold the vision"" which is the 14th episode as the 11th or 12th. this is going to throw fans for a loop because that episode took place after the ""secret invasion"" episode. they are also giving us a bonus unaired episode, ""powerless"". this is actually the 15th episode in the second season. the season has 26 episodes total,however when i emailed disney about this they said the 2 disc volume 5 dvd release is the entire second season. so apparently we won't even be given the rest of the season. if you want to see all the episodes then check them out on youtube. the last episode is called ""avengers assemble"". this is the one with galactus in it.",1345766400,31,939,4.402298850574713
5159090,5,B008FYZHLK,"AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES is pretty much the best superhero cartoon series since Cartoon Network's JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED; it's incredibly smart with having Christopher Yost as show-runner, who also was behind the surprisingly excellent (and sadly cancelled) WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN; the character design and voice acting are all equally good.

Be wary; if you haven't seen the entirety of the first season, spoilers will follow.

Where this show really shines though is through character, which always stays very true to the comics, and also is in using the bits and pieces of the existing Marvel Universe mythology and creating great story arcs around them. This particular disc features fallout from the finale of the first season in which Captain America is revealed as a Skrull. For those who aren't uber-fans of comics like myself, the Skrulls are a race of shapeshifting aliens whose own world is gone and they believe they are destined to take control of Earth as their new home. This leads the Skrulls and their Queen to infiltrate the highest places of power and even different criminal organizations, such as AIM and Hydra. Their most valuable asset though is Captain America. He works within The Avengers and SHIELD to fracture them and sow the seeds of distrust but in a very passive and seemingly benevolent way. Soon the question of trust becomes so preeminient on certain characters that they can't trust anyone.

Of the episodes that are on this disc, there are so many excellent ones, such as the cartoon adaptation of the classic Thor storyline, ""The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill"", where Thor finds out his is not the only being in the universe worthy of wielding the mighty Mjolnir. Also ""To Steal an Ant-Man"", which introduces us to the Heroes for Hire team of Danny Rand (Iron Fist) and Luke Cage (Power Man). The episode ""Michael Korvac"" introduces The Guardians of The Galaxy, who are awesome because ROCKET RACCOON. The most powerful episodes though are ""Who Can You Trust?"", which shows the fracturing of the Avengers from a more personal point of view; ""Nightmare in Red"", which introduces the Red Hulk battling Hulk through the machinations of a mysterious but well-known villain; and ""Prisoner of War"", which features Captain America (the real one) teaming up with good guys and bad guys alike to escape their Skrull captors.

The thing that stings the most about this is that this series will soon be over, and there's no good reason for it, other than to capitalize off the success of the AVENGERS feature film. This will lead to Chris Yost being pulled off this show and being replaced with hack extraordinaire Jeph Loeb and to a new cartoon called AVENGERS ASSEMBLE, which will be placed more firmly in the Marvel film universe. But what Marvel and Disney don't seem to get is that the reason this cartoon is so fun and so good is because it isn't in the film universe. We have the live-action films for that. To abandon THESE characterizations in favor of what can only be a cash-grab gives me just another reason to be a little disappointed in the Marvel/Disney partnership.

Although, while each volume of EMH is great in its own right, I'm also hopeful that someday, we will be treated to full-season releases of these episodes at a more reasonable price, and maybe even on Blu-Ray, which apparently Canada has already been treated to...",1343779200,53,3380,4.881533101045296

5159101,4,B008FYZHLK,"Let me start off by saying that this is an awesome series. The writing is great, the acting is great, etc.

The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because, as others have stated, this set lists the episodes in the incorrect storyorder. As far as I can tell, two episodes are out of order on the second disc. Although this is annoying, I don't feel it warrants a 1 or 2 star rating as others have given it. (Honestly, how hard is it to manually select the episodes in the right order? There is a thing called the internet where you can find the correct order and be mindful of what episodes to watch & when).

Aside from the blunder on Marvel/Disney's part for the dvd set, the series is great. The overarching storyline in this season of the Skrull invasion is simply engaging and worth watching.",1397606400,,809,4.315789473684211
5159102,5,B008FYZHLK,"THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 5: SECRET INVASION collects together the thirteen episodes from season two of the tv series. The episodes do a good job of combining old school references to the original comic book heroes with a post-modern sensibility. Unlike several episodes in season one, the episodes in season two are not meant to be viewed out of order. There are some exceptions, but by and large, most of the episodes in Vol. 5 have to do with the Skrulls Secret Invasion of Earth and when viewed out of order, it really messes with things. With that said the episodes in this volume are not in the order they should be watched, but are in the order they were produced. Therefore, you have to do a little jumping around to watch the series the way it was meant to be seen.

Disc 1:
Episode #1, The Private War of Doctor Doom  Doctor Dooms forces attack the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and kidnap Wasp and the Invisible Woman.

Episode #2, Alone Against A.I.M.  A.I.M. unleashes Technovore in an attempt to distract Tony Stark while they steal Stark technology.

Episode #3, Acts of Vengeance  the Enchantress seeks revenge on her former allies in the Masters of Evil and the villains seek help from the Avengers.

Episode #4, Welcome to the Kree Empire  the Kree attempt to conquer Earth.

Episode #5, To Steal an Ant Man  Henry Pyms Ant Man suit is stolen and he hires the Heroes for Hire to find out who did it and why.

Episode #6,  Michael Korvac  the Avengers attempt to protect a man, Michael Korvac, who appears to have escaped from somewhere in space from those who imprisoned him. The Guardians of the Galaxy appear.

Episode #7, The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill (this should be episode #8)  Thor discovers that hes not the only one who is worthy to possess Mjlnir.

Disc 2:
Episode #8, Who Do You Trust? (this should be episode #7)  Nick Fury returns and reveals the invasion of the infiltration of the Skrulls.

Episode #9, BeholdThe Vision! (should be episode #14)  a mysterious figure called The Vision comes to steal Captain Americas shield.

Episode #10, Nightmare in Red (should be episode #9)  Red Hulk suddenly appears and attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.

Episode #11, Infiltration  the Skrull invasion begins with an attack on Wakanda.

Episode #12, Prisoner of War (should be episode #10)  Captain America and the other prisoners aboard the Skrull prison ship make an escape.

Episode #13, Secret Invasion (should be episode #12)  the Skrull invasion is in full force.

The real episode #13 was actually the episode entitled Along Came a Spider but that is found as the first episode on Vol. 6 (the final volume) of EARTHS MIGHTIEST HEROES.

THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 5: SECRET INVASION also contains a bonus episode, Powerless. It was not originally aired in the U.S. Powerless. Sequence-wise it happens after BeholdThe Vision! Powerless features the return of the Enchantress. Fully controlled by Surtur, the Enchantress offers Loki freedom from his prison in exchange for the destruction of Thor. In addition to the bonus episode, there are two Avengers: Unmasked episodes in the collection.

Im glad that season two of THE AVENGERS: EARTHS MIGHTIES HEROES was only divided into two volumes instead of into four. However, I don't know why they couldn't have kept all the episodes in their broadcast order.  Overall, THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOL. 5: SECRET INVASION is an entertaining cartoon and a good way to introduced people unfamiliar with the comics to the characters.",1393804800,,3560,4.883333333333334

5159107,1,B008FYZHLK,"Despite what has already been mentioned about the 'out of sequence' I felt that in both seasons the writers turned the incredible hulk into the incredible joke.  He shows up in les then half of the episodes, and half of those he's nothing more than an onlooker and most of the ones they have him fight in, hes by far the weakest and most insignificant of all the avengers, getting tossed around like a rag doll all the time by the enemy and also by his own team.  If he makes a hit its usually against a very insignificant creature and even then the other avengers had to weaken it first.  The writers also made a mockery of the other avengers in several episodes as well. especially in the red hulk one. ridiculous to think they would abandon the green hulk so easily when they know what the shape changers were all about (except capt America). The writers need to have their asses sued big time by Stan Lee. There's no way Lee could have approved that crap.  I will admit that the storylines were good though.",1373846400,,1011,4.390374331550802

Otherwise the episodes don't make sense, and the previously on... at the beginning of each episode is a spoiler for upcoming episodes that should have come earlier.

I was anxious for season 2 right when I finished the first season. I didn't buy the volumes of the show, I bought the entire show on Blu-ray from amazon.ca and it works perfect in my ps3.

This new volume, 5, is not a good representation of the show, because as amazing as the show it is, a lot of what makes it great is the momentum it builds from episode to episode. Every episode leaves you wanting to know what happens next. So to play the episodes out of order is a crime to the show itself for the wonderful story telling. Skipping even 1 episode can ruin some parts of the show. Yes, it's nice to have the show on a DVD, but I assumed to watch it the correct way versus out order. If you are a fan of this show, wheras the episodes on this volume are great, it is not a fair representation of the wonderfully crafted show.

It may not be in chronological order, but it is 13 different episodes of season two. Our family is very sad to hear that this great series is not going to be continued, but we will continue enjoying the total 52 episodes once Disney/Marvel completes the production of the final 13 episodes of season two in dvd format. We believe that Disney will be graceful and give us the faithful fans of the Avengers the final thirteen episodes of season two in Volume 6 of this series. The decision to discontinue this series may have been made by those in authority who didn't realize just how great this series was, and their decision may have hurt all of us who have truly enjoyed this magnificent series, but at least the second season will hopefully be completed soon. Then we can look forward to the next installment of the Avengers series in animated cartoon format following the successful 2012 Avengers movie.

I am glad that I lived to see these classic Marvel heroes produced in both cartoon and movie format. Thank you Marvel and Disney for giving us the fans the best of both worlds, cartoon and live movie action. Please honor your fans and customer's wishes by publishing the final thirteen episodes of Season Two of the Avengers series and the final season of X-Men Evolution which was also cut short and not released on dvd format. There are many fans like us that are still waiting for these dvd cartoon releases who are willing to pay for the actual legal copies of these cartoon films. None of us want to obtain illegal copies in order to have a complete set of the very best cartoons that we have enjoyed. Please release these cartoons for all of us to enjoy if you truly value your fans, and customers.

The beautiful artwork, animation, coloring, action sequences and visuals have brought the Marvel Classics to life. Thank you for producing such quality work. Again this is absolutely the very best series of Marvel's Mightiest Superheroes. We have enjoyed many other series produced by Marvel and Disney, but this Avengers series by far exceeded them all. It is a great series for both young and old to enjoy, and it is very faithful to what Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Don Heck, John Buscema, Sal Buscema, John Byrne, George Perez, Gene Colan, Gil Kane, Dave Cockrum, Neal Adams, Walter Simonson, George Tuska, and other Marvel greats produced in the first 70 years of the Marvel Universe's history.

It's one of the worst decisions Marvel has ever made, and I eat, sleep, and breathe Marvel.

Now, what on earth were they thinking when they decided to put ""Behold... The Vision"" as episode nine. It doesn't make any sense there. It totally throws off the storyline and gives away what is going to happen. My advice: skip that episode and watch it at the end.",1349222400,4,703,4.285714285714286

Not sure why Marvel continues to play this game (to be fair DC is doing same with Young Justice).  But not going to buy until there is a complete season package.  No normal TV show sells like this... can you imagine ABC putting out 4 episodes of Once Upon a Time or w/e and expect people to buy them?  Give me a complete season, and I will give you money.  Stop jerking us around.",1349136000,10,549,3.9908256880733943
