8270665,5,630172383X,"Perfect story for boys and girls to illustrate that coveting what others possess can land us in a great deal of trouble. A great deal. In this case, it can land you in a tower with a very wicked witch for your only companion. But wait, what happens when love intervenes? Can love break a witches' spell? Carol Lyney and Agnes Morehead give delightful performances particularly when the roles are suddenly reversed.
