8418679,3,B0048IZF0A,"Beautiful voice which has gotten better with physical maturity and experience. I wasn't in love with the selection of songs. I was hoping for more operatic arias and less pop songs. I just saw Grigolo in London perform in the Tales of Hoffmann. He was wonderful. Indeed, the entire cast and production were stunning. But, for easy listening, this DVD is worth having.",1479340800,2,367,4.841269841269841

8418681,5,B0048IZF0A,"I had not heard of Vittorio Grigolo when he came up as a suggestion while I was  searching other dvd's.  After reading the rave reviews I decided to give this a try, and boy am I glad.  This concert is a feast for the eyes and ears.  The setting in Rome is drop dead gorgeous.  The film and sound are HD quality.  Vittorio has such amazing control of his voice and sounds equally amazing in a live setting as he does on his studio recording.  He puts every ounce of his being into every song he delivers.  This concert is like butter, and hey...he's not bad to look at either!",1394496000,,576,4.172727272727273
8418682,3,B0048IZF0A,"I didn't care for the choice of songs performed.  He has a great voice, but it wasn't exhibited in this concert.",1379203200,,112,4.333333333333333
8418683,4,B0048IZF0A,"I like the DVD, but it seems that the DVD was put together using various pieces from different concerts.  So the video quality is a bit inconsistent, some are better than others.  With that said, if you like Vittorio Grigolo, you will still enjoy this DVD.",1364860800,,256,4.543478260869565
8418684,5,B0048IZF0A,"The entire concert is a feast for the eyes and ears!  The setting is beautiful and the variety of music is perfect, but the performance by Vittorio is the icing on the cake.  He is every bit as wonderful to watch as he is to hear and the musical choices reach multi generations.",1320883200,5,278,4.226415094339623
8418685,3,B0048IZF0A,"Vittorio is absolutely marvellous and I have his CDs.  I was most excited when I saw he had recorded Dreams of Rome.  It was listed as a brand new DVD....This is not true because most of what he sang was on the first CD of his called ""Vittorio"".  I have had this CD for a long time and also have ""The Italian Tenor"".  There was no way I could tell before I purchased it what it's contents were.  If I had known, I would not have ordered it.  It was misleading and I was most disappointed.",1311811200,3,488,4.03125
