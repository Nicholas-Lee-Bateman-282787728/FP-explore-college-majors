8216262,5,6305338892,"Although it seems amazing that any champion can be considered overlooked, the 1982 Los Angeles Lakers fit that mold.  Anyone who knows of the NBA knows of 1980 and the coming out party of Magic Johnson in Game Six of the  Finals and how the team pulled together for a special season.  That same  group of people also know about 1985 and the demolition of the Celtic jinx  on the parquet floor of Boston Garden led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's  redemptively dominant performance and Magic Johnson's quiet triple-double.  Sandwiched in between those years, however, is a very significant  championship year.  From Magic's on and off court trauma with Paul Westhead  to the inclusion of Pat Riley into the head coaching role and the beginning  of Showtime.  From the key roles of Bob McAdoo and Mitch Kupchack before  such names as Byron Scott or A.C. Green were even around to the stardom of  Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, not to mention perhaps one of the greatest  backcourt tandems in Johnson and Norm Nixon.  This video portrays a  wonderful team that has been lost in the scheme of glamorizing the NBA yet  is perhaps one of its best catalysts for modeling the changing of the guard  in how the game was played.  It is a movie well worth the review of Laker  fans obviously but of NBA fans most definitely.",963792000,14,1301,4.693333333333333
