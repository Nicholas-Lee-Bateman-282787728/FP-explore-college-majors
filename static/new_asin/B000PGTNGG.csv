8191281,4,B000PGTNGG,"This is a movie about  a ""brief therapy"" for a teenage girl coming-of-age and coping with her dysfunctional family and demanding boyfriend.  ""Yes but"" refers to the excuses we make when we do not really want to do something.  According to the analyst in the movie, we play games--we pretend that we want to do something, but something else makes it impossible to achieve.  When another person offers a reasonable solution, the first person says ""yes but"" and finds another excuse why the solution will not work.  This film is about psychological game playing.

It is well done, light and realistic.",1234396800,4,598,4.871287128712871

8191283,5,B000PGTNGG,"""Over one hundred years of psychotherapy and things are getting worse"" is often an under current of shrinks in film. Oui, mais is a well written and entertaining examination of 'medicine' that relies on the talent and character of the individuals involved. Ms Duqueene blossoms into a believable responsible woman as the story unfolds, her love interest's character is somewhat disturbing, as are her parents (French marriages are more free form than Americans) but Jugnot's shrink unravels the whole story for us. Both Freud and Jung wrote of and interacted with their patients in a similar fashion, peeling away each onion layer of their troubled individual psyches. I whole heartedly recommend this well crafted film, and enjoyed taking its medicine.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Your-Teen-is-Crazy-Loving-Your-Kid-Without-Losing-Your-Mind/dp/0936197447/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes, Your Teen is Crazy!: Loving Your Kid Without Losing Your Mind</a>",1219622400,6,1004,6.5
8191284,5,B000PGTNGG,"I have a foreign release of this film under its French title Ouis, Mais...It's known as ""Therapie"" (Therapy) in some other countries. This is a wonderful little gem of a movie--the best movie I've seen about therapy. Emilie Dequenne is great. I'd love to see her come to Hollywood and make U.S. films. I actually picked up the movie because she's in it, and I liked her so much in Rosetta and Brotherhood of the Wolf. The film is about a therapist who tries to help her deal with her family/relationship problems. It really rings true--especially the mind games her mother plays with her. Just a charming, fun film. Don't miss it!",1201824000,14,630,4.633928571428571
