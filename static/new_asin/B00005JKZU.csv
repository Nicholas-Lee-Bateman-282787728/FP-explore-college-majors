1440427,5,B00005JKZU,"As with all of the previous reviews, I'm chomping at the bit for The Two Towers to be released.  After seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that so much can be lost if the book is not read, since they in general are better than the movie.  Lo and behold how accurately Jackson stuck with the book, which is, after all, one of the greatest works of fiction of the century.  Only Tom Bambadil stands as left in out among major characters.  The Two Towers, if a comparison may be drawn, seems a lot like Empire Strikes Back (I love Star Wars too) in that it's grittier, darker, and moodier than the first installment.  The Battle at Helms' Deep looks to be a highlight, and I look forward to meeting Eomer and Theoden.  I will not spoil the ending, even though I much anticipate the emotion that the actors will use in that scence.  It's truly one of the most heart-rending in the whole story.  Most of all, Gollum, who was rarely seen in Fellowship, plays a MAJOR role in the second tale.  I really want to see if the develop him as much as I'd like...he'll be an interesting character to watch.  From the trailer itself, and not just the books, the Battle at Helms' Deep looks awesome.  A veritable sea of orcs, 10,000 strong against thousands of men.  A best of all, in the middle of this turbulent battle, Legolas and Gimli have a contest going on, lol!  Watch the previews, buy your tickets way ahead of time, arrive way ahead of time, and feast your eyes on what's sure to be one of the year's best movies!",1027728000,5,1536,4.328671328671328
1440428,5,B00005JKZU,"After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring more than a dozen times and sitting with eyes widened and glued to the screen during The Two Towers trailer, all I can say is Hurry December!! Please hurry!!  (I have already preorderd the theater cut that will be out in August and the Extended collector's edition due out in November...hopefully this will help the time pass a bit faster!)For not having read the books, the gentleman who wrote the review on the trailer seems to have a good grip on the story and like so many of us 'Ringers' seems to have been bitten by the Tolkien bug!

1440429,5,B00005JKZU,"wow, wow, wow, wow.....that's all i  can sem to say about seeing the fellowship of the ring, and seeing the trailer for the first time in the movie theatres...being a LOTR fanatic, i don't know if i'll ever be able to be patient enought for the 2 towers to come out!!!  WOW!!  i was quite dissapointed that this movie did not win the oscars ofr best supporting actor( Ian Mckellen) or best picture.  it was a good enought movie to win all thirteen nominations!!...two towers or return of the king is definetly gonna win...this is (in my opinion) the best book ever written, and if you agree with me, well, you know what i mean.....anyway, i encourage you all to get your two towers tickets soon, cuz when december comes, they're gonna be selling like hotcakes!!!",1018310400,8,762,4.580882352941177

1440683,5,B00005JKZU,Always been a fan of JRR Tolkien. This is a fantastic rendition.,1520812800,,64,4.416666666666667
1440684,5,B00005JKZU,As described,1520640000,,12,5.5
1440685,3,B00005JKZU,"RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers adapts the second part of JRR Tolkiens popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving Fellowship of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.

This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, theres a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so theres not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then youll likely appreciate this installment more than me.

There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they're also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be.

Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as owyn, Thoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and thats about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story.

Despite these negatives, The Two Towers was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

1440846,5,B00005JKZU,"It Should Be A Felony To Not Watch LOTR. 9.999/10. As a teenager, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy were my favorite books and over the years I have read them multiple times. I have also watched any & all Hobbit/LOTR animated movies. Normally, after reading a book(s) that I love, I don't enjoy the movie adaption. The LOTR trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, is one of a very few exceptions.
Considering the limited time available to tell the tale, & understanding that not everything from the books could make it to the screen because of said time limitation, I can't think of anything that could have been done better. Is it perfect? No, but it is as close to perfect as a movie gets. But because some people love to complain (attention seekers) & nitpick, there will always be some negative reviews. When reading reviews of something I  am thinking of buying, I generally read 3 of the more detailed positive reviews and then around 10 detailed negative reviews. I want to know why the haters hate the item(s) & a few quality positive reviews + a decad of quality negative reviews tells me more about why I should or should not buy the item(s) than just reading the positive or negative reviews exclusively.
I read one review that complained that the Ent were slow and ugly in the movie and that went against the books. Not true. In the books the Ent were slow moving, slow to reach decisions (not slow witted, just slow to make decisions) and not exceptionally beautiful. They're trees! Large and long lived. Wise and slow to anger. Strong but slow moving. The movie portrayed them wonderfully.
The Hobbits were depicted perfectly. Gandalf was spot on. Saruman, Strider/Aragorn, Legolas, Gimmlie, etc. The actors were perfect for the roles. And the tone, the ambience, the vibe, whatever you want to call it was amazingly...I can't think of a fitting word to describe what I'm trying to say. WATCH THESE MOVIES!
This is one of those movies that everyone should see. And hopefully seeing it will encourage many more people to read the books as well. Tolkien created a language, for Pete's sake. An actual language (The Hobbit was written by Tolkien, an Oxford professor, as a study in linguistics).
To not read the LOTR series is, in my opinion, a moral crime, mitigated only by watching the movies.
Grab your older children (some violence is too intense for young children and may give them nightmares), toss a bag of popcorn in the microwave, pour a glass of soda, and enjoy family time with Frodo and Company. Make some memories.
It really is that wonderful.",1517961600,,2576,4.699115044247788

1440848,4,B00005JKZU,"The broken Fellowship continues with plenty of beauty and intrigue, but I'm afraid the film is marred by the presentation of the Ents.  The book gives them much more depth of character, but in the film they're slow and ugly.  Of course they save the day, but not before the short-attention-spanned audience suffers with them for a long chunk of time.  Also featured in the film are Merry and Pippin, who are not really many people's favorite characters, Saruman, unpleasant and treacherous, and Gollum, who is funny but hard to look at.  But there's plenty of good in the film to sustain the high level of the series.",1517616000,,617,4.685185185185185

If you are not yet ready to tackle the extended editions, start out with the regular versions and if you like those, then watch the extended editions and you will enjoy spotting the extra scenes and getting more back story. Again, I HIGHLY recommend these films. They are timeless and beautiful. (I also recommend the books if you like the films)

Just for reference, the order of the films is as follows:
1. Fellowship of the Rings
2. Twin Towers
3. Return of the King

1442564,5,B00005JKZU,"Why is the extended edition of The Two Towers such a great movie?

There are several distinct elements of high quality here which combine to create something rather marvelous. They Include:

THE RAW MATERIAL:

J.R.R. Tolkiens original books constitute an entertaining, whimsical fantasy tale when taken at face value, but they were also consciously written with the intention that they be firmly rooted in pre-Christian northern European mythology, history, and culture.

In other words, although this is a fictional story, it resonates deeply of something which is ancient, and real.

THE MUSIC:

Even before the opening credits have finished rolling, you will come to understand that the musical soundtrack will do an excellent job throughout, anticipating, interpreting, and intuiting the events and emotional context of each scene.

It was no accident that composer and conductor Howard Shore won the Grammy Award for the Best Score Soundtrack Album for The Two Towers.

THE CINEMATOGRAPHY:

The South Island of New Zealand presents a target rich environment for an outdoor camera crew.

The first images on the screen - a close-up aerial flyover of the spinal crest of a row of glaciated mountain peaks - demonstrates that the director understands this, and that he is going to take maximum photographic advantage of the high ridges, the boulder-strewn plains, and the wide, wild vistas upon which this story unfolds.

GREAT SCENES:

Gandolphs summoning of Shadowfax.

Aowyns singing of the Old English funeral ceremony for Theodred.

Aragorn in the stables soothing the frightened horse.

Aragorn washing up on the riverbank, dreaming of Arwen as he is rescued by his horse.

Sam seeing the Oliphant.

The moment when Treebeard changes his mind and decides to go to war after all.

When the boys discover the provisions and the pipe weed after the battle, and decide to light up.

THE ACTING:

The casting for each of the main characters was quite strong.

 Ian McKellen was a perfect fit for Gandolph. Likewise Brad Dourif was absolutely made for the role of Wormtongue.

In addition, there were three distinct groupings where the chemistry between the characters seemed just right - Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, and the warrior band of brothers Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.

THE DIALOGUE:

Succinct dialogue where each character gets to express themselves in their sharply unique voices abound. A sampling of my favorites:

You shall not pass!

Theyre thieves, they're thieves, they're filthy little thieves!

Theyre taking the Hobbits to Isengard!

The forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it!

Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?

Looks like meats back on the menu, boys!

What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Give me your name, horse master, and I shall give you mine.

Side? I am on nobodys side, because nobody is on my side.

Gandolph? Oh yes...that was what they used to call me.

Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!

There is nothing for you here. Only death.

Captain Boromir, you have shown your character.

...and best of all:

Youve some skill with the blade.
The women of this country learned long ago that those without swords can still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my Lady?
A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accepts them, and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You are a daughter of kings. A shield maiden of Rohan. I do not think that will be your fate.

If you have heard of the reviews of the The Hobbit, do not let it deter you. The Hobbit got its reviews because the director was exhausted. Who wouldn't be? A great majority of these first three films were done by hand - meaning CGI was used only to account for extreme narrative description. These films demand respect.",1460160000,,580,4.37962962962963

1442816,5,B00005JKZU,"This was so much better than the regular version! The added scenes really add background to the story and give it's much more definition.
It is really long, but as an avid Lord of the Rings fan, the more time the merrier! I did have to watch it in two sitting because it's close to four hours. So if you are not a major fan, be prepared!
All the characters are able to develop better and help you see their motives and ideas more clearly.
We really got to see more of the Rohan characters as well as a more in depth look  at Faramir and his past.
It was so great and I look forward to watching the last one!",1458259200,,607,4.016528925619835

The reason this movie even has two stars, however, is because of the orcs crawling down the walls and the Balrog, yay.

1443048,3,B00005JKZU,"Best of the three. Actors are fine in their roles. Merry and Pippin are way over the top schtick. However, Peter Jackson should never have been given the rights. He really doesn't have a feel for Middle Earth and Tolkien's depth of ethos which is essentially very English. He really doesn't get the magic. New Zealand is beautiful but this really should have been filmed in England and Europe. Finally it's all too apparent from the ""Disney"" vibe and abusive use of special effects, that the man's main purpose was to make bank not and beauty. 2 stars for Return of the King for the aforesaid reasons and ZERO stars for the Hobbit movies where Jackson's prostitution of a great story is most evident.",1452297600,,700,4.653225806451613

1443145,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jacksons first adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, was a highly praised entrance into the imaginative atmosphere that Tolkien has written about.  It conveys the fantasy narrative into being realistic by not going over the top of magical powers displayed by wizards and but still presents the magical tale with an enormous mystic realm filled with historical depth told by millions from various races. Furthermore, Jacksons choice of actors gave complexity that has the audience tag along with the ensemble cast on an epic journey throughout Middle-Earth and ending with a cliffhanger and questions wanting to be answered. The Two Towers not only exceeds expectations of a being a sequel but pushes it out the water into being a fantastic film. The story continues where its predecessor left off at where Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) carry on their journey to Mordor where they encounter the dangerous Gollum (Andy Serkis), gigantic elephants, dragons, and a relative of a former companion. On the other side of the world, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) pursue the Orcs to rescue their Hobbit friends but on the way they found Gandalf (Ian McKellen) alive and more powerful must save a kingdom corrupted by their enemy, Saruman (Christopher Lee). Every shot throughout the film was very clear and made the setting fit within the fantasy-theme storyline. The Two Towers does great at showing how a respectful and strong king and the destined main character can become easily corrupted by dangerous surroundings but as long as they got their supporters around to aid them in their internal and external struggle, they can continue to prosper. Additionally, the film presents how the darkness within the realm spreads throughout the lands causing destruction everywhere making it clear that all of mankind is trouble as Sauron power gets stronger and waging war among everyone that gets in his way.  The action showcased is another reason why the film will leave you in a trance and once the three hour running time is over, youll want to watch it again. Ill even consider The Battle of Helms Deep to be one of the best action-packed sequences ever put into a film. Two Towers is probably the strongest out the Lord of the Rings trilogy but itll still make you want to see its final chapter, Return of the King, afterwards.",1449014400,,2432,4.987684729064039
1443146,5,B00005JKZU,"I loved this movie, as much as the first one. And like the first one, this extended edition is well worth the money. The added scenes on the trek to Helm's Deep as well as the scenes during the battle of Helm's Deep were wonderful, as were the additions with the Ents, Merry, and Pippin.

Also like the FotR extended edition, the appendices on this one are amazing. Peter Jackson certainly knows how to spoil his fans! I especially loved the easter egg hidden in the scene selection, which takes you the movie awards where Gollum/Andy Serkis give a speech. Epic, my peeps. Epic.",1448841600,,578,4.5576923076923075

1443976,2,B00005JKZU,"The weakest of the three LotR films.

In fairness to director Jackson, this must also have been the most difficult of the movies to make.

While The Two Towers was originally published as a separate volume (owing to a postwar paper shortage), Tolkien didn't write it that way. Its the mid-section of a single massive tome.

And in the manner of middle sections, there isn't quite so much happening here: Its a relative lull between the terrors of Moria and the wild spectacle of Saurons attack on Minas Tirith.

Yes, you could argue theres the rise of Isengard and storming of Helms Deep. But this seems to me something of a straw man that Tolkien erected just so he could tear it down.

And that leads into another issue: The ""Two Towers segment is not Tolkiens best work in this saga. Its easy to see in the text over this stretch that the author was beginning to tire of his creation. The language isn't as careful or supple. Hes beginning to rush and bluster through sections he would have lingered over lovingly in The Hobbit or the first third of Lord.

Finally, any structure that requires this much jumping around that cant help but sacrifice a certain amount of continuity and atmosphere.

In print, a lull can (and did) serve a strategic purpose: It helps give greater impact to what follows.

But you cant make a movie about a lull -- not a good one, anyway -- and I think a better option for the writers would have been to compress this material and divide it between Fellowship and Return. Jackson instead stretched too little material over too great a distance and thus was forced to over-invest in what does happen: Helms Deep.

And this was for me a curiously unsatisfying affair. Its an issue more easily experienced than described, but its almost as though the filmmakers worked too hard at getting the details right and somehow lost sight of the bigger picture. What should have come across as relentlessly exciting and fluid affair seemed rather rigid, creaky and, yes, dull.

Its not helped along by the use of King Thoden in this sequence. Once Gandalf lifts Sarumans spell, Rohans leader becomes  a far less provocative character. Most of his dialog is cliches and one-liners and his moods are all over the map. Id blame script and editing before Id blame actor Bernard Hill, who couldn't very well give a regal aura to pedestrian lines or conjure consistency from haphazardness, but the part surely needed either to be rewritten with greater resonance or dropped more into the background so Thoden can emerge from brooding as the flawed hero.

Sadly, thats just the most obvious of the movies gaffes.

For instance, Gandalfs return could have been better handled. It should really have seemed beyond hope, as astonishing to us in the audience as to members of the Fellowship. But the movie unnecessarily foreshadows it at the start -- Jackson striving to use Moria as the missing bookend and the return itself is rather ordinary and accepted a little too blithely by Aragorn & Company.

While the models and effects were and remain impressive overall, they're less consistent here than in Fellowship and some have not aged well -- notably the scenes in which the Ents overrun Isengard.

While Frodo is something of a sidelight in this episode, Elijah Woods acting is more annoying here -- Frodo was made of much sturdier stuff -- and its well that much of the water in these segments is carried by Andy Serkis. He does an even better Gollum than the one Tolkien imagined. (Though perhaps Tolkien understood something Jackson did not: With a character like Gollum, less can be more.)

This would also have been a better film at about two-thirds the length. The stretchmarks are visible. Too many scenes run longer than they needed to run without additional payoff for the extra time. Theres too much Arwen, too many attempts to lend pathos to a story by lingering on anonymous refugees, too many meaningful looks.

Finally, Jackson sacrificed a great natural ending scene at Orthanc -- tossed almost haphazardly into the extended version of Return -- that could have put a much more satisfying cap on the film than the rather Bonanza-like one he adopted.

No, I don't like this movie much, but Im not blind to the few real pleasures to be found here. Much of the Fangorn sequence (and Treebeard in particular) is delightfully close to Tolkeins text. So is the scene in Theodens court when Gandalf lifts Sarumans spell. So is Brad Dourifs splendid take on Grima Wormtongue.

And a small but memorable good thing: It has the spookiest damn orc in the whole series.",1432598400,2,4585,4.744654088050314

1444382,5,B00005JKZU,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

The answer is yes -- and much more. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is not quite as beautiful and strange as the first movie, but it makes up for this by the even more epic, spellbindingly complex story. Jackson follows different groups as they make their way through Middle-Earth, encountering Anglo-Saxon-style kingdoms, talking trees and the most horrifying of nightmares.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted. And

Though billed as such, ""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" when Frodo and Sam went off on a journey by themselves. So now, the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth -- it's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

While there are some humorous moments still (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them), there is a darker tone to the overall story. Aragorn's quest along with his friends involves a seemingly hopeless battle against the evil wizard Saruman, which may involve the deaths of many innocent, ill-equipped not-soldiers. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller, more intimate stories, like Gollum's sometimes-chilling struggle between good and evil... which manifests as multiple personalities. And the final battle is capped by a magnificent, tear-jerking speech by Sam about what they are doing (""Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. Because they were holding on to something"").

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, as Frodo increasingly is worn away by the Ring's evil. And Sean Astin's Sam becomes even more determined to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths -- even as Frodo slips away from him.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too. Mortensen shows Aragorn growing into a natural leader who passionately wants to save the people depending on him, and becomes enmeshed in a love triangle with Miranda Otto's strong-willed warrior-maid Eowyn. Bloom and Rhys-Davies also get to change their characters with time, becoming best buddies and competing to see who kills more orcs. And while McKellen isn't quite as much fun as Gandalf 2.0, he still has the wisdom and fire of his previous self -- and as his opposite, Christopher Lee gets to be disdainful and vicious.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an epic done right -- it's crammed crammed with so much action, beauty and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1425945600,,4235,5.002840909090909

1444385,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers was completed in 2002. It is the second film in the trilogy of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings', directed by Peter Jackson. Some of the events from the Second Book have been carried forward to the third edition called `the Return of the King'. The Two Towers are Orthanc and Barad-Dur.  Besides many characters coming back from the Fellowship of the Ring, this edition features &Eacute;owyn - a noble lady of Rohan who wants to become a warrior, &Eacute;omer - a Marshal in Rohan and Eowyn's brother; Th&eacute;oden - the troubled king and uncle of &Eacute;owyn and &Eacute;omer and his counsellor, Gr&iacute;ma Wormtongue. The actors were supplemented by several special effects creatures that included tree-like Ents, the pterodactyl-like flying steeds of the Nazgl. You cannot forget Gollum who is perhaps the most uniquely realized CGI character in a non-animated film. His facial expressions were modeled on those of Andy Serkis.

The surviving members of the Fellowship of the Ring were made to split into three groups - Frodo and Sam face many dangers on their journey to save Middle-earth by the destruction of the One Ring in the furnace of Mount Doom; Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs and are sheltered by the Ents in their eventual battle against evil forces of Saruman and Sauron; Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas come across a mysteriously transformed Gandalf as the white Wizard of the forest and battle Saruman's army at Helm's Deep in alliance with King Theoden.

The Two Towers combines stunning action sequences with an emotional narrative, leaving the audience spellbound and eager for the final edition.

Peter Jackson is in full command in this second edition of the Ring Trilogy. Howard Score reigns over the film with his towering and epic score once again after his outstanding effort in the Fellowship of the Ring.",1425686400,,1850,5.01628664495114

1444725,5,B00005JKZU,"I'm probably the billionth person to review this, but I absolutely HATED this movie in the theater! The theatrical release absolutely BUTCHERED the novel, added scenes and events that never occurred, and had me griping for 20 minutes after the credits ended about everything that was left out of and  wrong with the film.

Fortunately the extended version of the film makes up for most of the problems I had with it, and almost everything I pointed out that was missing either appears in the extended version, or  was deferred until ""The Return of the King."" This is still the weakest of the three movies by quite a bit, but it was the weakest of the books as well. The fact that Peter Jackson took artistic license and made the Ents refuse to go to war on their own, and instead had them manipulated into it by Pippin and Merry still ticks me off, as does the fact that the two Hobbits growing quite a bit after drinking the Entwater isn't emphasized enough. One of them became the tallest hobbit in history, and the other wasn't far behind, and that isn't shown when they get together with Sam and Frodo again.  Throw in the battle with the warg riders that does NOT happen anywhere in the series, and Aragorn falling off a cliff so everyone thinks he's dead, which never happened either, and I was pretty steamed with the liberties Jackson's team took with the book, just because they thought it would make for good action and gripping drama. (Ok, Legolas standing on a rise and killing a warg with every shot one after the other was really cool, as was him swinging up in the saddle behind a rider when the bad guys were closing in on him.) But that's NOT in the book! Neither is a bunch of elves showing up to fight at Helm's Deep, and making them like robots instead of hundreds of brilliant fighters like Legolas did them a great disservice. (Of course we were subjected to the same ridiculous portrayal in the last of the Hobbit movies as well.)

I could grouse about the differences between the book and the film forever, but I also have to concede that what Peter Jackson managed in his sweeping saga of ""The Lord of the Rings"" was everything I ever hoped for after I fell in love with the books at age eleven. The director's commentary version of this film explains why he and the really excellent artistic and writing teams he assembled did things the way they did. Once I understood that, I realized the quandaries they faced on what to include and when. Tolkien wrote the novels in distinct sections, but the order they were published in serial form and the order they were assembled into the novels didn't always match. So although the book ends with a cliffhanger, the film doesn't,  That's a bit due to Peter Jackson's style - most of the movies end on a hopeful note, even though the first two show that there are great challenges ahead. This movie ended halfway through the last chapter of the book, unlike the other two films. The ending seems cheerful, but we know Gollum is back, and bad things are ahead for the unsuspecting duo of Frodo and Sam.

I'm still stunned that  so much of what was missing from the theatrical release appears here in the extended version, or in the extended version of ""The Return of the King,"" which was absolutely brilliant and the ending was utterly faithful to the book. The song ""Into the West"" during the credits was great too. Unfortunately, the song during the credits of ""The Two Towers"" is forgettable, but it's also in competition with Enya's ""Let it be"" from ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" which was the best song of the three.

This movie is best appreciated by plopping down on the sofa for a 9 hour marathon of the extended versions of the entire series, and in the capacity, it earns 5 stars. Alone by itself it would only get four, since the other two movies in the series blew me away, while this one had several aspects that annoyed me. The writers could have stayed faithful to the original script and still had a thrilling movie, although only us Tolkien nerds would know the difference...",1422576000,2,4059,4.534153005464481

1445931,4,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers picks up seamlessly where Fellowship of the Ring left off, and the second part of the series is just as much entertaining as the first. I will say that the violence and creepiness seems a bit stronger this time around (orcs licking their chops at the prospect of a Hobbit meal) so it's not ideal for younger kids, but for older viewers there's plenty of action, battle sequences and guys yelling and they hack and battle. The filmmaking is exceptional and the CGI not too overblown, and Howard Shore's music fits the film mood perfectly. An excellent sequel.",1414713600,,573,4.683168316831683

You just miss out on too much that is necessary to fully grasp what is going on with each character!,1410566400,,362,4.417910447761194

Unfortunately Amazon canceled my order claiming the price at which I bought it was a mistake. When I went to reorder the Blu-ray the price was significantly higher what I had originally ordered it.

1447296,5,B00005JKZU,"One of the problems with theatrical releases, is a problem with running lengths demanded by the studios. Things get cut for the sake of running time. The additional time added to an extended edition as value to understanding the film. E.g., between the Steward of Gondor and the elder and younger sons. You get a better understanding of the story line. Following the book doesn't necessarily  give you that glimpse of what Director Jackson conveyed on the scream. BTW, Looking at the Hobbit, gives me a better understanding of the LOTR trilogy. What I hate is buying the theatrical cut LOTR trilogy, then studio releases the extended edition
DVDs. But I like many others will suffer thru the process. While some say that Two Towers is not so important as Fellowship and
Return of the Kings, it serves a useful purpose of adding meat to the last film RK. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the Hobbit trilogy.
and suffering thru the problem of releasing the short version before the extended edition. I am so happy that Director Jackson
is doing both projects. The continuity issue doesn't exist. BTW, I sometimes have a LOTR night playing all  night long. Now I play
Hobbit first, to set everything up.",1396310400,2,1200,4.764423076923077

so here's the review of the first film

a little old dude has a ring that sends a little dude on a quest with the help of another old dude. They walk.. allot.. i mean a whole lot.. and occasionally encounter other species and stuff. there is some magic and swords and other things that get us to spend our summer movie money and buy the blurays, so that's pretty cool. good flick.. long.. allot of walking. but good",1395360000,,495,4.311827956989247

1447393,4,B00005JKZU,"As much as I Love The Lord of The Rings,I give The Two Towers:four stars instead of five,because of the total hollywood way,in which they completely blow out of all proportion,the romance between Aragorn and Arwen. It is true,that in the original story,the way that Tolkien wrote it,there was great love between them,but he never made it into a main,focal point of it,to the place where it threatened to almost eclipse,the real,grim;utterly sombre,deadly serious plot,of Frodo and Sam,having to go into Mordor,to destroy The Ring. I Like Everything Else about the way that the Two Towers is Done Well Enough,but I'm afraid that this one thing really detracts somewhat from it,for me;and I Think Limits my overall enjoyment of The Movie.

1447493,2,B00005JKZU,"Faramir.

Faramir, in Tolkien's The Two Towers, had the high integrity to know his limits and thus refuse the Ring.  Faramir has intelligence coupled with moral courage and a deep respect for others.  In my experience such people are to be treasured.

To write Faramir into a traitor, turning the passages into a betrayal where, in Tolkien's work Faramir takes in Frodo and Sam and gives them friendship and aid when they deeply need it, is close to scurrilous and reflects poorly on Mr. Jackson and his screenwriter.

Most of the ""great"" reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely ""eye candy"" to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level.

I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture. Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout. The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the ""heros"" should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs. Gosh, is this made for teens?

She loved The Hobbit so much and after watching The Fellowship of the Ring wanted to watch The Two Towers. We streamed this via Amazon Prime and it was a seamless experience.

1447990,5,B00005JKZU,"We must all remember that Jackson had to do these movies to fit in a certain amount of time, so obviously he had to shorten, cut, and alter some plot lines from the book. We must also remember that Jackson shot this movie in about a year, which is ridiculous considering its scale and brilliance. Jackson is probably one of the biggest Tolkien fanatics out there, so he tried to stay as true to the books as possible, but as a director, he had to make changes that would help sell the product more. If Jackson stuck exactly to the books, then that's all it would be, a hollow, uncharacteristic rendering of the books. Jackson took Tolkien's novels and ideas and put his own creative input into them. Yes, some of the changes can be seen as unnecessary to the rest of us Tolkien nuts, but in the end he made these movies out of love, but also to make money. Referring to the previously mentioned parts of Arwen and Faramir, the love dynamic between Aragorn and Arwen is obviously not prominent in the books, but that love dynamic is evident in Tolkien's other works and notes. Also, adding a love dynamic to a major picture cinema would help sell the product, and let's face it, the entire public wants to some sort of love dynamic in a story, otherwise it would be just another action movie. Also, about Faramir being somewhat of an antagonist at first, just helps stretch the story out more, and helps the story line flow, especially with Gollum. Because right before Sam, Frodo, and Smeagol are captured Faramir help bring Smeagol back to his villain side. Also, representing Faramir as a passive and helpful character like in the books would do nothing but waste the movie's time. Adding the conflict that Faramir has with himself and his duty to Gondor, ultimately choosing that his life would be forfeit if he let them go, helps make Faramir a more prominent character in the story, and adds a whole new dynamic instead of just having him be a simple Captain who helps them on their way. I personally felt that it was a bit pointless, and it pissed me off that it was like having another greedy Boromir in the story, but ultimately Jackson did a good job, and he did what he did to make the movie richer, and better. If you really think about it, Jackson's movies are the best portrayals of any book in history. There has never been a better portrayal of a book before.",1388793600,,2374,4.497685185185185

I'm very happy.  I have seen and enjoyed the Extended version, but I am not the person who needs an extended version.  I like owning the Original Theatrical version.  If you a fan, but not a fanatic, this is the choice for yourself or any other fan you know who doesn't own any DVD of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.

He says ""Fly, you fools"". It's really important to know what he says and how he's looking at the situation.

The extended edition for the first movie was great! There was much more detail about the worlds and character development, which to me are the best parts. I'm hoping the same is true for this edition.

Viggo Mortensen kills it as Aragorn and he has to since this film is largely on his shoulders where the first movie was more on Frodo, Gandalf and the Hobbits. Mortensen just seems like a guy that you would want to follow and can range from sympathetic to straight up badass. The film is pretty much split into three tales. Frodo and Sam transporting the ring, Legolgas Aragorn and Gimli helping out Rohan, and Merry and Pippen with the Giant Trees which really may feel like the film is dragging when it switches to them but it really helps build to the ultimate pay off at the end battle.

1448709,4,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers picks up immediately from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and makes no concessions to newcomers: no 'story so far', no opening crawl and only a couple of brief flashbacks. Like so much with the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy this was a risk but one that paid off, with the film gaining immense financial and critical success.

The film has much to recommend it. As with the first movie, it benefits from an excellent cast that gets even better in this film with the likes of Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, Andy Serkis, David Wenham and Brad Dourif joining proceedings (viewers of the Extended Edition also get an early chance to meet the excellent John Noble as Denethor). Little criticism can be made of the cast and their evident enthusiasm for the project and this helps carry the film over the bumps in the road. As with the first movie, the effects are excellent and even better than before, with Weta Digital clearly emboldened with confidence after their work on the first film. The stand-out is Gollum, the most stunning digital creature creation to date (and so he remains). Between the animators, Andy Serkis's superb performance and the reactions of his co-stars, Gollum is brought to life and utterly convinces you he is there in the film.

The set design and miniature work is also excellent, with Edoras and particularly Helm's Deep being extraordinary creations. This informs the Battle of Helm's Deep, the stand-out battle of the trilogy and one of the most stunning engagements ever depicted on film. Jackson films the battle with dynamism and allows viewers to follow the geography and ebb and flow of the battle with clarity. He also holds back on the CGI as much as possible to focus on scenes of actors engaging in actual combat and some excellent use of miniatures (particularly when the Deeping-wall is breached).

However, the film is not quite as successful as Fellowship. The biggest problem is inherited from the book, with the action split three ways between three different groups of characters. Tolkien decided that switching back and forth would be distracting, so he held back Frodo and Sam's storyline and did it all at once. Jackson is forced to switch back and forth and this is indeed not as successful as might be hoped, with carefully-built tension dissipating as we move to another storyline at a moment of tension. This problem is enhanced by the fact that a large chunk of Frodo and Sam's storyline has been held back for the third movie (where it does actually belong, chronologically), including the infamous cliffhanger ending. This forces Jackson and his team to introduce new material to fill the void. This results in the infamous 'weakening of Faramir' arc where Faramir first decides to give the Ring to his father and then changes his mind. The problem isn't so much the idea - giving Faramir more to do and more of an arc is not necessarily a bad idea in itself - but the logic. It is unconvincing that Faramir, having started to fall under the Ring's influence, would then back up and let Frodo go with it. The book approach (where Faramir avoids being influenced by it at all) is less 'dramatic' but makes more sense.

Merry and Pippin also suffer from the structural issues, though this is inherited from the book. Whilst Aragorn and company engage in political issues in Rohan and fight off Saruman's forces (twice in the movie) in epic battles, Merry and Pippin spend most of the film on the shoulders of a giant ambulatory tree talking about stuff for hours on end. The actors do their best, but it's hard to suppress a groan when the action cuts to another scene of Treebeard talking in extreme slow motion. It also doesn't help that the Entmoot lacks the grandeur of the book and their storyline then suffers a major believability collapse when the Ents seem to be unaware that Saruman was burning down their own forest (and Treebeard can then summon an entire Ent army to him instantly). It's only at the end, during the assault on Isengard, that their storyline really kicks into life. However, there's not much helping the interminable Elrond/Arwen scenes or the pointless 'Aragorn falls off a cliff' interlude.

Still, whilst the weaknesses niggle, the sheer scale of the movie, the splendid cast and effects and the epic impact of the battle for Helm's Deep cannot fail but impress.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (****) is not the instant classic its predecessor was, but remains a highly watchable and entertaining movie.

Note on the Extended Edition: As with its predecessor, The Two Towers was re-issued as an Extended Edition a year after its original release. The Extended Edition adds approximately 40 minutes of new material to the movie. These include more scenes with Merry and Pippin (some of which fortunately do not involve riding around on Treebeard) and more material for Frodo, Sam, Gollum and Faramir. This, happily, has the effect of balancing out the three big storylines in the film and makes them feel more of equal weight. The highlight of the Extended Edition is a great flashback scene uniting Boromir, Faramir and Denethor on screen which helps explain their dysfunctional family dynamics much better than dialogue alone ever could. Despite the greater length, the Extended Edition of The Two Towers actually feels shorter by improving the pacing between the three storylines and adds some excellent new scenes. Accordingly, the Extended Edition (****) is the definitive version of the film and is recommended over the cinematic cut.",1377129600,,5562,4.854583772391992

By this time in the story, the Fellowship has taken serious losses and Frodo has gone off with Sam to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  Along the way they meet Sm&eacute;agol who is drawn to the power of the ring and whose alter ego Gollum is a crafty, hard-edged creature.

In this movie Sm&eacute;agol (voiced by Andy Serkis) is truly the most interesting of the characters.  The animators that dreamed up this unfortunate creature very excellently show his contrasting emotions.

1448713,4,B00005JKZU,"While FOTR had mostly minor inconsistencies TTT has major ones.
-Eomer was imprisoned by Wormtongue, not banished.
-Treebeard already knew Isengard was destroying the forest, the Entmoot was called to convince the other Ents to go to war against Saruman (Treebeard knew Merry and Pippin weren't orcs after he heard them speak, by the way).
-The women and children of Edoras are sent to Dunharrow, not to Helm's Deep with Theoden and the Rohirrim. There's also no stupid Warg/Orc/Rohirrim battle where Aragorn goes flying off a cliff into a river.

There's a lot more (Google it), but it really throws you out of the movie if you've read the books. Jackson changed things around, then had to change more to cover his tracks. He makes quite a mess, but as usual the battles and locations are very visually striking and nearly make up for his mistakes.",1376352000,,849,4.815068493150685

The fellowship of the rings is scattered and the story jumps back and forth between the three groups as each faces its particular challenges.  Most interesting to me was the character of Gollum/Smeagol, who externalizes the internal voices most of us hear in some form.  Frodo and Sam's relationship to Gollum is indicative of the problem we all face with one another.  Frodo calls him Smeagol, encouraging the best in him.  Sam never trusts him, realizing his potential to betray at the slightest upset.  Another strong aspect of the film is the inspiring words of Gandalf and Aragorn spoken to their companions  when they  are tempted to despair.",1376179200,,765,4.823076923076923

While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.",1372118400,,1215,5.0497512437810945

1449132,2,B00005JKZU,"SPOILERS!

Here are my point by point thoughts on The Two Towers:

--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship.  It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead.  I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film.  I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a ""whiter"" version of oneself.  Gandalf struts around like nothing happened.  Also, when someone says that they were ""sent back"" from heaven ""until my task is completed"", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible.  This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.

--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears.  I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy.  He's practically unwatchable.  His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity.  Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase.  That's about it.  One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves.  Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain.  Yes, we got it the first time it was shown.  Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity.  Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one?  At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT  to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books.  His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.

--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing.  Everything is gray.  The environments are gray.  The skies are gray.  The bad guys are gray.  Gollum is gray.  The orcs are gray.  The weapons are gray.  The buildings are gray.  The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.

--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship.  We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity.  Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects.  We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.

--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists.  We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable.  They're just generic caricatures to be ""fought against"" as necessary.  There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end.  A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.

--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography.  The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies.  Very little of this appears in this movie.  We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies.  You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks.  At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies.  To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes.

--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).

--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie?  Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks.  It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do.  He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed.  Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know.  The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight.  They also walk around and put on armor.  Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences.  I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through.

--This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history.  Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick.  Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important?  Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out.  That's it.  Also, Liv Tyler can't act.

--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this:  there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie.  Pippin and Aragorn are given ""possible deaths"", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character.  Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism.  I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.

--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative.  There's not much in terms of spellcasting.",1370563200,,5859,4.895112016293279

1449642,5,B00005JKZU,I read the complete works of J.R.R. Tolkein so many times I lost count. Each time I pictured in my mind's eye a very similar version of what Peter Jackson has put on film. I love the way he (for the most part) didn't re-write the story in order to make the movie. Close to the detail that Tolkein placed in his writings.,1363824000,,320,4.095238095238095

1449749,3,B00005JKZU,"This movie is way too long.

To start off the movie in itself is okay. The visuals are amazing as always.  The only problem is that it is ridiculously long and it drags out forever!

I know that other reviewers are going to attack me but I must say that The Two Towers is quite boring, even for a person like me who has sat through hundreds of movies.  It just never ends!  Never!  And when it does, it ends so quick; typical for a Peter Jackson film.

In my opinion, Peter Jackson should cap his movies to two and a half hours max!

I don't mind long movies.  Several of them are excellent.  They just need to flow like Titanic or Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.  This just doesn't.

In conclusion, The Two Towers is an okay sequel to an amazing film The Fellowship of the Ring.  At the end, you will enjoy your adventure to Middle Earth...kind of.",1362441600,,859,4.228395061728395

1450332,5,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings movie trillogy is one of the best movies to come from hollywood in a very long time -- the last time anything as good or close to as good was the original version of the Star Wars series (episodes 4, 5 and 6) before the re-edits messed it all up)

Unlike other movies -- this extended edition was created specificly at the same time of the original theater release -- to tell more of the story -- infact, if you watch the theater release version you will not fully understand the full aspect to the story -- the elements that add to the extended edition is not a re-edit but the true original edit before it was cut down to satisfy the people who don't have the attention span to watch longer movies.

If you prefer well done movies this is better, but you will never be able to go back to the original theater released version. You've been warned.",1358553600,,870,4.266666666666667

1450621,5,B00005JKZU,"I've never been a ""fantasy"" movie person but these movies take you into a fictional time, that after watching you kinda think it may have really happened for a moment. I highly recommend all three of these movies.

1450626,5,B00005JKZU,"Having somehow misplaced my copy of the Two Towers sometime over the past couple of years, I finally felt that I should pick up a new one in anticipation of the release of the Hobbit.  This being quite well-priced and delivery from amazon being so convenient, I ordered this, and found it to be as powerful a movie as ever.  Among the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I am tempted to say that this is my favorite; the first movie resorts to some queer film editing techniques towards the end (the combination of slow-motion capture and the lowered frame rate during several sequences accomplishes nothing and results in a strange feeling) and omits a large number of important scenes from the book, and the last film, while certainly one of the grandest of achievements, also omits some fairly important parts, notably the Scouring of the Shire.  What this film accomplishes is a much more compelling tale and a powerful transcription of the second book.  For all of those reasons I feel this is perhaps the best of an incredible trilogy.",1357257600,,1051,4.695652173913044

But after reading and watching Game of Thrones. I am a little bored by this trite narrative.  And the film is a little sausage intensive.  There were opportunities to expand female characters, the film didn't try.  I wish it were more realistic of the fantasy period.

I think it's weird that someone's head can be chopped off, blown to bits, but romantic encounters reduced to glances or pecks.

Do not make the mistake I did.  I bought this because the product page stated this was the extended version on blu-ray.  It was not.  If it is important to you, make very sure you are purchasing what you want.  I did not research this and trusted amazons description which states it is a branch style extended version.  This was only the theatrical release.  For the Two Towers, if it says 170-180 minutes, it is the theatrical version.  if it is over 220 minutes, then it is the extended.  I am very disappointed in amazon for saying that I was purchasing the extended version in their description when it was ONLY the theatrical.  The ""What do you Get"" section is WRONG for theatrical version.  Amazon providing an in-accurate product page caused me to purchase the wrong version.  The 1 star is due to amazon selling me the theatrical while describing it as extended.  Thusly the product is not as described.",1354406400,14,918,4.627329192546584
1451295,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is the second movie of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (and yes, you need to see the first movie or/and read the first book or else you'll be totally lost.  The movie starts off with the two hobbits, Frodo and Samwise getting closer to entering Mordor.  The orcs and goblins have kidnapped the other two hobbits and are on the run, however Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are in hot pursuit.

Several key characters are introduced here.  First Gollum who is primarily hoping to return the ring to his care (In the book ""The Hobbit"" he had the ring a long while before Bilbo found it).  However, Gollum is an intriguing character who has a very dissociative personality is in in continual conflict with himself.  I found part of myself disliking him and the other part feeling sorry for him which makes it understandable why Samwise and Frodo would see these different aspects of him and treat him differently.  The ""Gollum"" side represents the aspect of him that seemed to have been created during the period of the ring.  Then he has the ""Smeagol"" side to him which seems to be his personality before getting the ring, which, while being much more humane than ""Gollum"", still had a longing for the ring which his ""Gollum"" side uses to his advantage.  These two sides of him will fight sometimes and agree others.  All of us have a side to us that is driven by selfish purpose.  Sigmund Freud spoke of our ID nature which drives us toward physical longings and Gollum is a good example of someone being ruled by their ID nature.

My favorite Lord of the Rings character is introduced, Eowyn.  Her character is a strong-willed woman not afraid to fight.  Her character goes counter to how some people in society view women as being weak and helpless.  I like that her character represents strength and women equality.  It is interesting that Tolkien created her character in a time that feminism was just getting going.  I could see a woman like her being part of the feminist movement.

The race of ents are also introduced, most specifically an ent named Treebeard is focused upon which cares for Merry and Pippin while they are in the great forest.  I think the ents are one of J.R.R Tolkien's most creative beings.  They are tree like creatures that watch over the forest.  I enjoyed the environmental aspect portrayed by this section of the movie.  Treebeard would state ""no one cares for the trees anymore.""  I think this is a very good point that could be make in today's society as large corporations destroy rain forests and other aspects of the environment in order to stuff their pockets.

Aragorn's inner conflict becomes evident now that he believes Arwin is leaving for the undying lands.  He meets Eowyn who takes an interest in him (he hates her cooking though).  Even though it is a small aspect of the movie, it is well played.

Of course with all three movies I recommend get the extended version, however, this one has some very good parts that were left out in the theatrical version.  The primary example is it gives a little history of Boromir, Faramir, and their father.  I think this section of the movie does Boromir some justice as one does not see this aspect of him in the first movie.  You can't help to feel some sympathy for Faramir as he is torn between doing the right thing and impressing his father.

You will get to find out what truly happened to Gandolf after his fall in the first movie.  There are more fight scenes and action in the Two Towers than in the first movie as the movie climaxes with a full battle between those at Helm's Deep and Saruman's army.

It has been years since I have read the books but from what I call the movie pulls it off pretty well.  Both the Lord of the Rings series and Harry Potter series are a few of those movies that are worth watching even after reading the books.  The graphics are pulled off well (especially with the ents).  The movies, along with the books are rich with meaning and life lessons.

If you saw the first movie and enjoyed it, you will likely also enjoy this one...but be prepared, it will leave you thirsting for the third.

1451444,3,B00005JKZU,"Even though they've been released several times in different versions and formats, the coming of ""The Hobbit"" has encouraged Warner Bros. to give fans a chance to get the extended editions of all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films AGAIN in special Blu-ray 5-disc sets. There's no possible way that any stone is left unturned or single piece of behind-the-scenes footage is left unseen after these are delivered.

Each film is over three and a half hours to over four hours long spread out across two discs. Couple those with three discs filled with special features and you have enough ""Lord of the Rings"" to satisfy even the most obsessed Tolkienite or Tolkiendil.

""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy tells the story of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his journey to dispose of a powerful ring controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Frodo and eight companions must make their way to the edge of the fiery Mount Doom through deadly trials and tribulations. They meet up with different characters and creatures throughout their long journey.

The best way to describe my feelings about these films is summed up in ""Clerks 2."" There's a lot of walking and then they drop the ring into Mount Doom before walking home again. Alright, I'm partially just kidding. I do like the movies but in no way am I an uber-fan.

Do I think they could've been edited down to a shorter running time even in their theatrical versions? Absolutely! I've never made it through any of the movies in one sitting. Basically, I can only take about an hour and a half to two hours of each film before I have to give myself a mental break. I found the three hour long ""King Kong"" easier to sit through and more entertaining.

My opinion of the films doesn't mean anything in the long run. What matters is that millions of people across the planet absolutely adore ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and just can't get enough of it. The release of the extended editions of the films loaded with bonus material is a present to them.

Each one is presented in pristine high-definition video and audio. The picture is as clean and polished as you've ever seen it. The 6.1 surround mix will fill everyone's home theater system with the sounds of Middle Earth. Every growl of an Orc and whisper of Sauron jumps out of the speakers at the viewer.

There are too many special features to even begin to list. I'll throw out a few to give readers an idea of what to expect. Each volume includes multiple featurettes, documentaries, galleries, maps, and interviews with the cast and crew. As I said above, if there is even one piece of ""making of"" material left I'd be surprised.

""Lord of the Rings"" enthusiasts might be as mad as ""Star Wars"" fans are over the amount of times these movies have been released at first. However after seeing the amount of special features is included in these different five-disc sets, I'm sure they'll get over it. If you're looking for an exhaustive experience as a Tolkienite or Tolkiendil, ""The Lord of the Rings"" Extended Edition 5-Disc Sets are guaranteed to satisfy your cravings.",1346976000,,3069,4.649446494464945
1451445,4,B00005JKZU,"It really irritates me when Amazon combines reviews for a particular title, regardless of the many mediums it's available in.

This review is for the 5 disc extended edition blu-ray set for the second film. Not the trilogy blu-ray set, in case this somehow ends up on that page as well. This review will be posted for all three films since most of what I'm going to say pertains to all of them, but any film-specific information will be kept to that respective film. Once I've found 37 hours to have some friends over for a marathon I'll return and give my opinion of the upgraded format. For now this is just a review of the packaging and other things I noticed that might impact someones decision to buy or not.

I ordered these separate extended sets because I had read many reviews for the extended trilogy blu-ray set saying 'the Fellowship' has a green (I think it was green) hue prevalent throughout. I did read one review saying the issue could be resolved with some TV adjustments. Beyond that inconvenience I was hoping two things would be different with these sets: first I thought maybe the green issue would be fixed (I'll let you know if that's the case in my update for 'fellowship'), and second I was thinking maybe a more understandable reason for a re-release would be to make all 5 discs (15 between three films) blu-ray. This is not the case. That was the first thing I checked and all the non-feature discs say DVD, while the two discs for the main feature say blu-ray.

To sum up, I am happy I bought these sets if only for the beautiful cover art on each. If you don't care about the cover art, if you're not worried about having 15 blu-ray discs total, and if the possibility of a green-less 'fellowship' isn't a big deal, then it probably doesn't matter if you buy these sets or the whole trilogy blu-ray set.

I'll update hopefully soon with info on the films themselves.

Update 09/13/12

So I've finally watched the film since purchasing and I want to give my thoughts as I did with ""Fellowship"". I really can't say much. The movie looks great, but it looked great in 2002 also. I feel like the images are crisper and colors more vivid, but without a side-by-side comparison it's hard to tell. Snobs might complain but they're just wanting to be heard when they do.

Specifically, any part of the movie involving Faramir. What does this have to do with Rohan, you may ask? Read the chapter ""The Steward and the King"" from ""Return of the King"" and you will understand. I felt that Faramir was weakened as a character due to the changes the movie made from the book. Why, for instance, did the ring have to go to Osgiliath, and why does Faramir just stare stupidly while Frodo climbs to the top of a random wall and stands in front of a Nazgul? Why would he then decide Frodo's an okay ringbearer and send him on his way? It doesn't make logical sense.

There were enough good points in the movie to look over the logical fallacies, though. I did enjoy seeing the various locations as envisioned by the crew, and some of the visuals were downright spectacular. If I were judging by the visuals, I would be giving this movie five stars. However, the plot bothered me enough to mark this down to four stars.",1320969600,,1154,4.367441860465116

It was still too long, though - I have such a hard time sitting through these, even though I enjoy them.  I am always so ready for them to be over, and I hate feeling that way about a movie.

I can't really speak to accuracy with regard to the book as I haven't read the books in years (It's on my list, trust me!), but as near as I can tell the movie followed the book fairly closely.  It certainly captures the essence of the story.  These movies were very well done; good actors, great special effects (especially for being several years old now).

See my review of the Return of hte King. I review the Lord of hte Rings as a whole, because as my annoying sister points out: ""Tolkien wrote the epic as one book, but at the time of publishing the publishers decided to split it into 3 books so that it would be more apealing to readers, seeing it as a series and not one 10k page book, and to make more money from sales.",1312156800,,376,3.960526315789474

1451755,5,B00005JKZU,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

The answer is yes -- and much more. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is not quite as beautiful and strange as the first movie, but it makes up for this by the even more epic, spellbindingly complex story. Jackson follows different groups as they make their way through Middle-Earth, encountering Anglo-Saxon-style kingdoms, talking trees and the most horrifying of nightmares.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted. And

Though billed as such, ""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" when Frodo and Sam went off on a journey by themselves. So now, the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth -- it's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

While there are some humorous moments still (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them), there is a darker tone to the overall story. Aragorn's quest along with his friends involves a seemingly hopeless battle against the evil wizard Saruman, which may involve the deaths of many  innocent, ill-equipped not-soldiers. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller, more intimate stories, like Gollum's sometimes-chilling struggle between good and evil... which manifests as multiple personalities. And the final battle is capped by a magnificent, tear-jerking speech by Sam about what they are doing (""Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. Because they were holding on to something"").

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, as Frodo increasingly is worn away by the Ring's evil. And Sean Astin's Sam becomes even more determined to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths -- even as Frodo slips away from him.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too. Mortensen shows Aragorn growing into a natural leader who passionately wants to save the people depending on him, and becomes enmeshed in a love triangle with Miranda Otto's strong-willed warrior-maid Eowyn. Bloom and Rhys-Davies also get to change their characters with time, becoming best buddies and competing to see who kills more orcs. And while McKellen isn't quite as much fun as Gandalf 2.0, he still has the wisdom and fire of his previous self -- and as his opposite, Christopher Lee gets to be disdainful and vicious.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an epic done right -- it's crammed crammed with so much action, beauty and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1310601600,16,4236,5.002840909090909

Peter Jackson's attempt of creating and establishing communities with their own characteristics ring true as well as the actors go over and beyond just acting, they give life to the characters so it feels as though we are watching something that could be real; we are transported to a world that is not us watching a movie, we are watching an adventure.

1451880,5,B00005JKZU,"It's usually said that the second item (book or film) in a trilogy is the weakest, but I think in this instance it's better than the first.  With the death of Boromir, the abduction of Merry and Pippin by the Uruk-Hai, the presumed loss of Gandalf to the Balrog, and Frodo's resolve to carry on alone--though Sam Gamgee stubbornly follows him--the Fellowship has been broken: Aragorn, Legoals, and Gimli have set off in pursuit of the two kidnapped hobbits, and none of the separate elements of the erstwhile band knows what has become of the rest.  Meanwhile, Saruman, who has become Sauron's puppet (though *he* thinks they're allies), has inserted a spy (Brad Dourif) into the court of King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of the horse-riding warriors of Rohan and contrived to so overlook the King that he's become next to helpless, while on the other side of the Realms of Men, Boromir's native Gondor is under attack from Mordor itself.  And all the while the creature Gollum follows Frodo and Sam, yearning to regain possession of his ""precious.""

The effects in this second volume of the franchise are even better than those of the first--Treebeard and the other Ents and their eventual attack upon Isengard, the Ringwraiths on their dragonlike flying steeds, and the attack of the vast orc army on the people of Rohan, trapped in their great keep of Helm's Deep with only a company of elfin archers to help them, to name just a few.  Frodo becomes even more a martyr-figure, which may not endear him to every viewer, while Sam transforms into his heart and conscience, managing somehow to keep his spirits up and keep him on track, and Gollum struggles with inner conflicts he'd probably forgotten could exist.  Aragorn meets Theoden's niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and discovers that perhaps he doesn't really love the elf-princess Galadriel as much as he thought he did.  Merry and Pippin transform from mischief-makers to determined partisans of the effort to defeat Sauron.  And the tension continues to ratchet upward as Frodo continues toward Mordor, where he hopes to destroy the Ring before Sauron can throw darkness over all the world.

1451883,5,B00005JKZU,"I've read plenty on this website about the thoroughness of the two extras DVD's, and I can't help but second that. I was fascinated by all the background behind the making of this movie, and it kept me up a few nights just wanting to watch the next feature, even as someone who didn't care for the book as anything special (don't hate!).

Yet I just had to comment on the technical marvels packed into this film.

The quality of video and sound on the two main feature discs blew my mind. Of all DVD's I've ever seen, this has had the most crisp and heart-pounding sound of anything I've ever watched. Mind, you, part of this is that I watched it on a PS3 and got the uncompressed Dolby Digital track, which was incredibly satisfying even with just 2 great stereo speakers and a bumping subwoofer. So really, if you have a PS3 or any other especially good sound system and a good TV you cannot get many better experiences than this DVD. The sound Oscars went to all 3 LOTR films for a reason - every sound is effect is appropriate and impactful.

The image is also particularly beautiful. The colors are warm and rich with color, making every frame a gorgeous picture. The battle scenes are appropriately dark and everything as they should be, but when all different colors are bright and distinct in other scenes, and in Fangorn Forest's verdant green vistas especially, the picture hypnotized me.

I guess I'm saying that we all know these are great movies. Get this release for the extras if that's your thing, but this release's best feature in my mind is the quality of the sound and picture - they're on a level I have never seen. And I'm not that picky with sound either, so it stood out even for me - you don't need to be a fan to appreciate this release, and the same goes for the other two Extended Edition releases. The Two Towers is just the one I happened to watch recently, so I have the freshest memory of it, but I own the other two releases as well and they are equally excellent all around. I don't think I can use enough superlatives to praise these 3 DVD releases, and I'll be watching the Return of the King tomorrow to finish off the trilogy. I know I sound like a fanboy, and so be it - a lot of other DVD's will sorely disappoint me after these Extended Editions, I have no doubt.",1300752000,,2304,4.351162790697674

Smeagol (Voiced and played by Andy Serkis) who decides to act as a guide for the two wondering Hobbits into the dark lands. The Fellowship such as Aragon (Viggo Morgenstein), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (Jonathan Rhys-Davis) go after the ones that kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) as they find out that Saruman (Christopher Lee) who is the puppet of Sauron sends out many armies to join in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil while they must protect the kingdom of Isengard ruled by aging king Theodon (Bernard Hill) who was under a dark spell from Grima Wormtounge (Brad Douriff) as the battle will begin and the now recovered Gandolf (Ian Mckellen) joins them.

Co-starring Miranda Otto as female warrior Eowyn, Cate Blancett as Gladriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Liv Tyler as Arwen and Karl Urban as warrior Eomer this is a spectacular and brilliant adaptation of Tolkein's beloved second chapter in his amazing literary fantasy trilogy now told on the big screen in a glorious way.

1452233,5,B00005JKZU,"The three *The Lord of the Rings* films [all directed by Peter Jackson] have clearly made film history, chiefly due to their marked overall excellence. This film trilogy, shot entirely in New Zealand, is breathtaking at a minimum. Here, I'm reviewing the *Special Extended Edition* [as opposed to the much shorter Theatrical Version] of the second of these films on DVD, *The Two Towers*.

I'm sure that the story is familiar to most who would show an interest in this film but, for the unindoctrinated, the overall adult fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien chronicles a group of travelers which includes a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and four hobbits, ergo: ""The Fellowship"". They are traveling because two evil wizards have joined forces to eventually conquer and enslave all inhabitants of Middle Earth. At the behest of these dark and nefarious sorcerers are orcs, trolls, wargs, and other heinous minions.

One of the hobbits [Frodo Baggins] has inherited a magic ring from an aged relative [Bilbo Baggins, of *The Hobbit* fame, a fantasy written by Tolkien for young people] and it soon becomes clear that this is *The One Ring* which rules all other magic rings of power within Middle Earth. It was created by The Dark Lord [Sauron, the more powerful of the two evil wizards] but it was inadvertently lost for many years. As The Ring [which can render one invisible, with certain negative caveats] ultimately ends up in the hands of Frodo, it becomes his quest (along with the rest of The Fellowship) to destroy the ring at Mount Doom, a huge volcano which lies within Sauron's sinister and well-patrolled realm of Mordor.

In *The Two Towers* the viewer is brought back into the tale just after a partial dissolution of The Fellowship has occurred. This nuance is a deviation from the first film [*The Fellowship of the Ring*] which is a very linear tale. Here, the story diverges into three or more directions: the journey of Sam and Frodo to destroy The Ring; Aragorn's development as a warrior and as a prospective King, and; Gandalf the Wizard's plan for dealing with the Evil sorcerers, Saruman and Sauron.

One could rightly say that this film has no beginning and no end, being derived from the middle book of a trilogy; however, this movie stands on its own, especially in the Special Extended Edition version which is being reviewed here. One could watch this film with no knowledge of either Tolkien's trilogy of books or the other two films of the series and still enjoy it. If it doesn't actually have an ending, it does still feature a *conclusion* of a sort. I don't think viewers are left hanging.

Director Peter Jackson, the cast, and the crew got ever more proficient as they produced these three films. Jackson sort of viewed his task as making one long film, thus the scenes were not shot in sequence, quite typical of film-making, but noting also that most films are not nine hours in length. Naturally, many changes were adopted within the scripts of all three films as time rolled along... and thus each movie clearly became better than its predecessor.

I think that most of the *MAGIC* of this film trilogy came from Jackson's inclusion of multiple technologies and special effects techniques - he did not wholly depend upon Computer Generated Images but when he did they were effected in post-production with absolute perfection.

Additional film magic was manifested through Howard Shore's magnificent classical filmscore for the trilogy. There is little doubt from my view that the soundtrack from this second film of the series was the greatest of the three. One of the outstanding segments includes singing by Isabel Bayrakdarian, a terrific Canadian soprano who is currently my favorite of all. The *Rohan* score is equally inspiring.

Of course the Special Extended Editions contain much more original music than the theatrical versions and it's all a great joy to the ear, even including the gloom and doom facets of the three soundtracks. They are available as three individual sets:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings-Fellowship-Of-The-Ring-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000BNI90O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings-The-Two-Towers-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000IZJZIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (The Complete Recordings)</a>, and,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000V6BE6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)</a>.

Perhaps the most important facet of my review is to encourage you to not bother with watching the theatrical versions of these films on DVD, and this is especially applicable if you've never read Tolkien's books. The theatrical versions are very good but they were meant more for theaters to collect from patrons for two showings per evening rather than to convey the details of Tolkien's complex story. The Special Extended Editions are perfectly edited to be both impressive and informative but they are never boring.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! *The Two Towers* provides us with an exciting Battle at Helm's Deep between Saruman's minions and the men of both Rohan and Gondor [the elves help out too], as well as the Ents' assault on Isengard, the Tower of Sauron; the continuing flight of Frodo and Sam into Mordor itself in an effort to destroy The Ring, and; all the dangers and hazards which befall Aragorn, Legolis [the elf], two of the Hobbits, and Gimli [the Dwarf]. The story jumps around from place to place (and from story to story) but it's all quite well-done and coherent. Since Tolkien depicted several towers in Middle Earth we cannot precisely say this for certain but, it would appear that *The Two Towers* are those of Saruman and of Sauron -- or at least Christopher Lee thinks so and so do I.

Every facet of this film manifests the cutting edge of every aspect of film-making, from the technology, even extending to the acting [and motion capture] of Andy Serkis who plays the creature Gollum, who really develops in this second film of the trilogy. We get to experience a broad range of acting styles from Orlando Bloom (who was cast for the role of Legolis fairly fresh out of acting school) to the venerable Christopher Lee [Saruman] who has made more films than anyone else that I'm aware of. To a person, all were magnificent in their perfectly cast roles.

Fans of the trilogy should also be aware that even though the character Denithor [Steward of Gondor] does not appear in the theatrical version of *The Two Towers*, he does show up in this Special Extended Edition. It's also a chance to see Boromir [Denithor's eldest son] again and the segment is quite a good one.

This is probably a good juncture to detail what one gets in this boxed-set edition. There are two DVDs which make up the film and there are *multiple* sound tracks which can be brought up on each of these, depending upon whether you wish to watch the films themselves or listen to various available commentary tracks [for example, a track of cast member running remarks as the film progresses]. Two more DVDs make up the total of four: these two are the appendices which beautifully depict exactly how this film was made, cast and crew interviews, details of the musical score, and so on. All this lasts for at least as long as would the film itself and it's all quite fascinating and well-done. Finally, the set comes with a small pamphlet inside which is a sort of map of what to look for on the DVDs and where.

I can hardly convey an adequate number of positive comments about this film except to say that the final film [*The Return of the King*] is even better! I cannot state that this is the best film I've ever seen but I can honestly comment that I've never enjoyed any films *more* than those included in this Special Extended Edition trilogy.

1452237,5,B00005JKZU,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when ""The Two Towers"" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.

""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play ""Gandalf 2.0,"" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.

The journey continues in ""The Two Towers,"" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1284595200,,3613,5.057142857142857

1452325,4,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is the inevitable sequel to Peter Jackson's dramatization of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".

The epic battle at Helm's Deep is the climax of the movie, but the real superstar is Gollum. Talk about being worth waiting for! The nasty and unpredictable creature was only momentarily included in the trailer, since Jackson just knew it would bring the house down anyway. Which, of course, it did. The inner struggle between the evil Gollum and the good-hearted but confused Sm&eacute;agol is a real classic. Is anybody surprised that the evil side eventually wins? Still, Gollum is to be pitied rather than hated. To him, the ring is like a narcotic. That too is nicely captured.

That being said, the weaknesses of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy also shines through at various points. The characters lack depth. There is no real tension between Aragorn and Eowyn, or even between Aragorn and Arwen. Faramir is extremely boring, and the tension between him and his father is somehow missing, too. Ironically, the only figure that undergoes some kind of character development is Gollum, which may be one of the things that make him so interesting!

Another problem is that Tolkien couldn't make up his mind whether LOTR should be a children's story or a fantasy epic for adults. ""The Two Towers"" is mostly the latter, but the childish aspect comes across in the subplot involving the Ents, giant talking trees spouting beards and very slow minds. I know that the Entish attack on Isengard is supposed to be some kind of symbolic ""revenge of nature"", but the whole thing nevertheless strikes me as quite ridiculous. Jackson probably didn't dare excise the Ents from the plot, but he should have!

There is also one problem which will bug Tolkien fans - the only actor with a reasonably correct elvish pronunciation is Christopher Lee (Saruman). The others pronounce ""Sauron"", ""Mordor"", ""Sm&eacute;agol"" and ""D&eacute;agol"" in English rather than in Tolkienesque...

I'm not a great fan of the LOTR universe, but, yes, I did notice!

That being said, ""The Two Towers"" is nevertheless worth watching. Apart from poor Gollum and the battle at Helm's Deep, I was also somewhat fascinated by Rohan. Is that some kind of Viking village? I think I recognize some of the symbols from Old Norse picture stones...

So, what stinks:

1) The story is dull.  Feels irrelevant.  No tension whatsoever.  A big snooze.  Waste of my time and energy---and clearly a huge waste of money to make the film.

2) All the various ""good"" races (dwarves, elves, hobbits, men) look like people.  The hobbits look like small, adolescent guys, the dwarf looks like a hairy, small, middle aged man, the men all look like tall, J. Crew manly men, and the elf looks like a slim, blond, too-cool surfer guy.  I much prefer the mental pictures my imagination conjured while reading the book.  This was cheesy.

3) The characters are all shallow and lacking in dimension.

4) Gollum, who is brilliant in the book, is downright peculiar and not believable in the movie.

5) Important plot material from the book is skipped, skimmed over, or changed in unnecessary ways.  I understand that the directors had a lot of material to fit into one movie, but still...they failed.

6) The orcs didn't look real.  They looked foolish and bizarre.

7) The voices of many of the creatures (orcs, Gollum, ents) didn't sound organic--they sounded annoyingly computer generated.

8) The Wormtongue character was cookie-cutter evil.  Although he wasn't Tolkien's most realistic character in the book, the movie does an even worse job with him.

9) It felt like the movie was geared for nine year olds...and undiscriminating nine years olds at that.

Again, can't really remember what wasn't in the original release so I'm reviewing the extended one. The cast continues to capture the essence of their characters and adding new dimensions (like the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is hardly touched upon in the books). The new cast members (Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, etc.), like the original cast, capture the characters perfectly. Gollum is finally featured (having brief cameo spots in the first) and is the scene stealer of the film (another common occurance of 2002 was the advent of realistic looking CG characters; Yoda, Dobby and Gollum). The dual nature of the character is intriguing and you really feel sympathy towards him as he's completely bound to the Ring. And Andy Serkis really does an excellent job of switching between the softer voice of Smeagol and the harsher tone of Gollum. The action sequences build upon what the first film has done; the Warg battle and the Battle of Helm's Deep, along with the attack on Isengard are noteworth. Again, from what I can recall of the theatrical version, this is the superior version. For thanks to a new scene, we see the brotherly relationship between Boromir and Faramir and how Denethor (who originally was first shown in Return of the King) favors Boromir.",1256774400,,1405,4.858333333333333

While running time for a theatrical version always dictate limited playing time, it becomes apparent two minutes into the extended movie just how much detail and clarification is lost in the theatrical version.

Peter Jackson clearly envisioned the extended version as the film to watch, it's clear in the pace and rhythm of the editing which seems to flow much better.",1255564800,,693,5.123893805309734

1452469,2,B00005JKZU,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING

(USA/New Zealand - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES / SDDS

Somewhere in Middle Earth, an unassuming hobbit (Elijah Wood) comes into possession of a powerful ring coveted by evil forces throughout the land, and he embarks on a quest with elves, humans and fellow hobbits to destroy the ring once and for all.

The first in a trilogy of fantasy films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novels, helmed by the unlikely figure of Peter Jackson (previously responsible for splatterfests like BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD). Despite a three hour running time, the film is invigorated by strong production values, excellent performances (especially Ian McKellen as a helpful wizard, Viggo Mortensen as a brave mortal who joins forces with his otherworldly brethren, and Wood as the hapless hobbit entrusted with a sacred mission) and a breakneck pace which remains faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's endeavors.

The computer generated castles and landscapes are breathtaking in places, but Jackson is forced to overplay his hand in this respect, and the trickery loses some of its impact after a while, but there's no denying the craftsmanship and dedication of the production team. Christopher Lee plays the central villain with frightening gravitas, and there's a wealth of fine supporting players, including Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, amongst many others. An extended version of the film has since appeared on home video.

I'm guessing 'buy now ship now' is great as long as there's no problem but, if you have any kind of a problem with their merchandise or order or whatever and they even THINK they may not get a perfect review. . . well, too bad for you.

1452597,5,B00005JKZU,"1. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition). The greatest trilogy in film history, presented in the most ambitious sets in DVD history, comes to a grand conclusion with the extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Not only is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien the longest of the three, but a full 50 minutes of new material pushes the running time to a whopping 4 hours and 10 minutes. The new scenes are welcome, and the bonus features maintain the high bar set by the first two films, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.
Peter Jackson's trilogy has set the standard for fantasy films by adapting the Holy Grail of fantasy stories with a combination of fidelity to the original source and his own vision, supplemented by outstanding writing, near-perfect casting, glorious special effects, and evocative New Zealand locales. The extended editions without exception have set the standard for the DVD medium by providing a richer film experience that pulls the three films together and further embraces Tolkien's world, a reference-quality home theater experience, and generous, intelligent, and engrossing bonus features.

THE RETURN OF THE KING, the third and final film in Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, finds Middle-earth on the cusp of great change. Weary hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) venture further into the dark realm of Mordor, guided by the increasingly desperate Gollum (Andy Serkis), the two-faced former owner of the Ring that Frodo must destroy in the fires of Mount Doom. Meanwhile Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) contend with the deranged ruler Denethor (John Noble) at the once-mighty city of Minas Tirith, as Merry (Dominic Monaghan) joins owyn (Miranda Otto) and the Riders of Rohan to hold back the forces of Sauron. Amidst the chaos, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must rise to his destiny, aided by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) in assembling allies for a massive battle that will decide the fate of Middle-earth. With RETURN, Jackson brings J.R.R. Tolkien's world-renowned tale to a stunning conclusion. As with THE TWO TOWERS, the director deftly weaves various storylines together in one remarkable scene after another. Spectacular visuals complement Jackson's sharp focus on the characters and their emotional battles. While the special effects help to create huge battles and frightening creatures on a previously unseen scale, they never outshine the excellent ensemble of actors who bring the heart of the story home. A truly astounding work of filmmaking, THE RETURN OF THE KING skillfully concludes one of the greatest trilogies in cinema history.

==============================================================================
2. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition): The extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was perhaps the most comprehensive DVD release to date, and its follow-up proves a similarly colossal achievement, with significant extra footage and a multitude of worthwhile bonus features. The extended version of The Two Towers adds 43 minutes to the theatrical version's 179-minute running time, and there are valuable additions to the film. Two new scenes might appease those who feel that the characterization of Faramir was the film's most egregious departure from the book, and fans will appreciate an appearance of the Huorns at Helm's Deep plus a nod to the absence of Tom Bombadil. Seeing a little more interplay between the gorgeous Eowyn and Aragorn is welcome, as is a grim introduction to Eomer and Theoden's son. And among the many other additions, there's an extended epilogue that might not have worked in the theater, but is more effective here in setting up The Return of the King. While the 30 minutes added to The Fellowship of the Ring felt just right in enriching the film, the extra footage in The Two Towers at times seems a bit extraneous--we see moments that in the theatrical version we had been told about, and some fleshed-out conversations and incidents are rather minor. But director Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's world is so marvelous that it's hard to complain about any extra time we can spend there.

While it may seem that there would be nothing left to say after the bevy of features on the extended Fellowship, the four commentary tracks and two discs of supplements on The Two Towers remain informative, fascinating, and funny, far surpassing the recycled materials on the two-disc theatrical version. Highlights of the 6.5 hours' worth of documentaries offer insight on the stunts, the design work, the locations, and the creation of Gollum, and--most intriguing for rabid fans--the film's writers (including Jackson) discuss why they created events that weren't in the book. Providing variety are animatics, rough footage, countless sketches, and a sound-mixing demonstration. Again, the most interesting commentary tracks are by Jackson and writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens and by 16 members of the cast (eight of whom didn't appear in the first film, and even including John Noble, whose Denethor character only appears in this extended cut). The first two installments of Peter Jackson's trilogy have established themselves as the best fantasy films of all time, and among the best film trilogies of all time, and their extended-edition DVD sets have set a new standard for expanding on the already-epic films and providing comprehensive bonus features.

Not seen in theaters, this unique version of the epic adventure features over 40 minutes of new and extended scenes integrated into the film by the director. DVD set consists of four discs with hours of original content including multiple documentaries, commentaries and design/photo galleries with thousands of images to give viewers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the film. Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship continue their quest to destroy the One Ring and stand against the evil of the dark lord Sauron. The Fellowship has divided and now find themselves taking different paths to defeating Sauron and his allies. Their destinies now lie at two towers - Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where the corrupted wizard Saruman waits and Sauron's fortress at Baraddur, deep within the dark lands of Mordor.

When My wife and I decided it was time to clean the dust off the Lord of The Rings and watch it again, I knew I had to purchase the Two Towers to complete the ""extended version"" collection. Since I was missing the Two Towers; I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. For anyone that may have seen the Lord of The Rings in the theater and would like to watch the trilogy again.

In fact, the more I watch this second ""episode,"" the better it gets!

Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.

This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?

It's 40 minutes longer, with some of the new scenes fans of the book will recognize being Frodo and Sam's scene with the elvish rope; a hilarious expansion on Legolas and Gimli's ""score-keeping""; and an insightful flashback scene that elaborates on Faramir, Boromir, and Denethor's relationship - the biased father, the honored and loyal first-born who cares for his brother, and the unfortunately ill-fated, paternally oppressed younger son.

1452738,5,B00005JKZU,"I always end up on the backend of a phenomenon-not really getting into something until everyone else has. Recently I've gotten involved with The Lord of The Rings fandom. Neh-I am certifiably obsessed! At least I am not obsessed alone. You know we are obsessed with The Lord of The Rings when my future husband found out my ring size by trying his replica One Ring on my finger. (A replica I bought him.) How did this craziness come about? Repeated viewings of The Two Towers Extended Edition that's how.

I didn't see The Two Towers in the theater. I didn't see it when they came out on DVD. I watched the culminating third Return of the King movie before the middle Two Towers film. Only when both my father and future husband insisted I watch The Two Towers did I succumb. I liked it well enough, as I did the Fellowship of the Ring and more so Return of the King. My Tolkien obsession, however, did not really begin until we bought director Peter Jackson's Extended Trilogy.

Fellowship's extended scenes were exceptional enough. Tidbit book info here and there and additional character development. Nothing in the extended films is excessive, redundant, or unnecessary fluff. Jackson cut the film's only for length, I'm sure-the extended version of The Two Towers clocks in at over three hours. The extended footage of Eowyn, Faramir, and Boromir ice the extended version.

Although it is much more subtle in the books, Jackson's cut footage of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) develops the crush subplot into a full-blown love triangle. In the extra scenes, you get the feeling that Aragorn does generally like Eowyn, and were it not for Arwen, or the Ring, or his destiny, he could settle in Rohan. We of course know different, and the bittersweet feel of the scenes is just the right flavor.

The real treat of the extended Two Towers is a lengthy flashback sequence involving Boromir (Sean Bean) before he journeys to the Council of Elrond. Denethor, Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father, wants The Ring for himself. Favorite son Boromir protests, but abides his father's wishes. Despite a loving relationship between Boromir and Faramir, Denethor nearly loathes his second son. Now that Boromir's dead, Faramir wishes to take Frodo and The Ring simply to prove his worth to his father. Although they differ significantly from the book, these insights into the Steward family are exceptionally done. Skillfully acted and directed looks and glances do in 10 minutes what takes the book 10 pages.

These scenes and two key scenes added to Return of the King involving the relationship between Eowyn and Faramir impressed, shocked, and intrigued me so much, I started reading The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson's vision presented in the extended Two Towers is truly worthy if he can get me to read the books. I never felt I had the time to invest in the epic. Not that I really do now, but the tidbits restored in the extended Two Towers have me wanting more of Tolkien's world. Who says books and movies have to compete?

Not only are the movies superior, but the extended trilogy also hails two discs of behind the scenes appendices per film. The wealth of material here alone is worth the price tag (about $80) of the trilogy.

1452859,4,B00005JKZU,"I must thank Peter Jackson, the cast, the crew, and Tolkien himself for the LOTR trilogy. Because if it weren't for them, then I wouldn't be the avid reader that I am to this day. As for ""The Two Towers"" it's an astonishing sequel to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". And the Extended Edition makes it all the more compelling. What you miss are great scenes that are mentioned in the book (Numenor), more character development between the main characters (Legolas and Gimli's final count at Helm's Deep), and a bit of comedy (Eowyn's cooking) that fairly lightens up the darker atmosphere that's present here.

As for the cast, they're just above excellent. However, I personally didn't like Gollum as much. Oh, Andy Serkis did a terrific job as the character, and the CGI is so realistic that Jar-Jar Binks must be crying his eyes out, but the overacting somewhat irritated me. The prime example would have to be the scene in which he battles his tries to depart from his evil ""conscience"". But other than that, it doesn't really ruin the entire movie. The new cast members (Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, David Wenham, etc.) give out fine performances, and the scenery of the land of Rohan gives more beauty and majesty in Middle-Earth.

The battle scene in Helm's Deep is the highlight of this film. For about half an hour, men and elves fight against the ten thousand Uruk-Hai. So there are hundreds of arrows, spears, swords, and probably only one axe (from Gimli). It's grand alright.

The music is more epic than ever before. The ""Rohan Theme"" with the Norwegian fiddle is the finest out of all of them. The choral motif with ""Arwen and Aragorn"" sounds beautiful and mystical. Gollum's Song is also a treat.

40 minutes worth of new scenes really IS worth getting this Extended DVD. And soon, I'll be buying ""The Return of the King"" Extended DVD, and I hope I get more thatn I expect (I couldn't believe that they cut out the ""Steward and the King"" chapter).",1225670400,,1971,4.671469740634006

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find that Gandalf is still alive. Frodo and Sam seek help from Gollum on getting to Mordor. Saruman sends his Orcs to Rohan, so the people flee to Helm's Deep where a huge battle takes place.

1452864,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is as close to a perfect movie as I've seen.  It's epic in scope, both in the actual story as well as the task of adapting the book into a movie.  While showing respect for the source material, Jackson wasn't afraid to tweak here and there in order to make the story work as a movie.  Instead of having half the movie tackle the Aragorn/Rohan story and the latter half detail Frodo and Sam's quest towards Mordor like the book did, the movie blends these two story lines together and makes them flow together as one cohesive story.

These Extended Editions are the best for fans of the book as well as newbies who don't mind a more complicated storyline than the theatrical editions. They are chock-full of more action, more humor and (dare I say it) more plot. Even The Two Towers, in which Peter Jackson took one of the most significant deviations from the novel (deciding that it would be more dramatic as well as realistic for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring), includes scenes that give additional backstory to the multiple subplots. It's such a beautiful film that it made even me, who is normally a stickler for movies sticking to such important plot points, fall in love with it. Gollum is absolutely stunning - the amount of physical discomfort that Andy Serkis forced himself into is mind-boggling but obviously worth it, given the results.",1212710400,,905,4.69811320754717

Like the books on which the films are based things only get better and better, every new situation more harrowing, every battle more immense and every word of dialogue more profound.

`The Two Towers' excels in every category; cast, production values, soundtrack and special effects as it flows perfectly from the material presented in the first film, adding depth and texture to the characters and plot while expertly laying the necessary groundwork to prepare for the finale `The Return of the King'.

1452991,5,B00005JKZU,"Once again, it is truly amazing how 43 extra footage can change your perception of a story. And, it is truly unfortunate that directors are inclined (read: forced) to edit films to appeal to a 'broader' audience. 'The Lord of The Rings : The Two Towers Extended Edition' is a much more complete and meaty version of the film and easily makes the theatrical version obsolete.

I've read the books (about 3 times), and I was one of those 'purists' who was a little frustrated with all of the edits and changes Peter Jackson and co. made to Tolkien's works. Eventually I came around and realized that its not easy translating a massive epic into three two and a half hour long films and I enjoyed the theatrical versions for what they were; an amazing epic fantasy drama of the highest order. Then the Extended Editions came out...

'The Two Towers' Extended Edition features 43 minutes of extra film footage, and once you have watched it you will never understand why these extra 43 minutes were shaved from the film. It may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things (especially when the theatrical cut was almost 3 hours long), but 43 minutes adds so much more to the film. Characters on both sides of this story are properly fleshed out and given more depth, and I cannot stress how important this 43 minutes of extra footage is to the overall story. I've always had an issue with the theatrical 'abridged' version, so the Extended Edition is a breath of fresh air.

Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when ""The Two Towers"" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.

""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, which is warping our dear hobbit out of his own mind. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play ""Gandalf 2.0,"" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.

The journey continues in ""The Two Towers,"" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1199664000,,3608,5.0385906040268456

We are lucky in the fact that J. R. R. Tolkien will completely follow each participant's path from beginning to end. All the wars are covered in detail and the progress of the ring bearer is chronicled. New creatures and old vermin reveal themselves.

As with the Ramayana, we find that every creature has his/her function and that there is no black and white in this purpose. Frodo alludes to this when he thinks of Gandalf, Aragorn, and Gollum. Even Gandalf tells not to hurt Gollum as he may play a larger role in the story that one could imagine.

Lord of the Rings is the greatest motion picture* of all time, no question about it. It's better than Alien, better than Star Wars, it's better than all of them. Though the movie I am currently reviewing is the weakest volume of the story. This by no means makes it a bad film, on the contrary it is among the best films I have ever seen, it's just not nearly as good as the other two. The reason for this is because this one edges into the realm of an action film, the ending is a 30 minute battle sequence, one of the best battle sequences ever filmed, but still a very long battle sequnce. Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job at molding a story in the middle of a battle, he proves that in this movie, but he does an even better job in the volume following this one, The Return of the King.

As I said before, the rating is just to put it in it's place with the rest of the series.

Thus I have not previewed all the additional footage on the other 2 discs included in this 4 disc set.",1195603200,,593,4.363636363636363
1453123,5,B00005JKZU,"I don't know how else to contact Amazon to correct a huge problem in regard to the LOTR films, but they BADLY need to separate the reviews on the various editions of these films (e.g., the widescreen, the full-screen, and the Special Extended Edition version).

The Special Extended Editions are BY FAR the superior choices for anyone wishing to watch these great films and they're well-worth the money, but a LOT of folks don't know about them. With the additional footage, the movies make infinitely more sense, especially to anyone who has never previously read the Trilogy. All three LOTRs films are available in this format, plus, each film is on two discs, due to the added footage. In addition to that, each one is presented in a nice cardboard case, has an informational booklet included, and offers two ADDITIONAL discs which are ""special features"" sort of information. This is essentially a ""collectors' edition"" but, as I have mentioned, the movie itself (for more casual viewers as well as for fans) greatly benefits from the additional film footage.

So, since once you've reviewed ANY version of LOTRs, one cannot review any other version (Amazon software sees this as a second review of the same product by the same person!), I am placing this information here to the prospective benefit of other Amazon customers (and victims!) *.*

Now, on to the story:

This is the second entry in the film-trilogy of The Lord of Rings. I'm rating each one separately to yield a more honest opinion of the entire series. I'm rating 'The Fellowship of the Ring' 4-stars, this one 5-stars, and, 'The Return of the King' 4-stars.

The film is a fantasy, fairy-tale sort of movie, to inform the uninitiated. The first of the three films tells of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, and his quest, (along with a 'fellowship' of comrades), to save Middle Earth by destroying the ancient Ring of Power, which is in his possession. He can only do this by traveling to the Land of Mordor (a VERY nasty place) and tossing the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, whence the ring was originally forged by an evil wizard, Sauron, (who is still evil and still around, and who is seeking to locate his lost magical Ring of Power big-time).

In this entry, we find that Sauron (of Mordor) and another now-evil wizard, Saruman, (of Isengard) have teamed up to fight the remaining non-evil entities in an all-out power-grab for Middle Earth. Mordor and Isengard each boast a huge heavy-metal-type 'tower', hence the movie title. Of course, Frodo's difficult quest continues throughout the movie.

The fellowship, having gotten split at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' now run into all manner of obstacles. Agendas also become mixed and there is much in-fighting amongst the various regional rulers which complicates defeating their common enemies, Sauron and Saruman. As a consequence of all this action, there is a LOT of jumping around in the film from place to place -- BUT, the director pulled off a coup: this story remains coherent, and pretty much stands on its own as a film. I would have thought this impossible and I wondered how they would ever do it successfully. But they did and I'm quite happy about it.

Now, the CINEMATOGRAPHY in all three of these films will knock you out -- superbly contrived, second to none. The COLOR SATURATION will bowl you over as well. The script and STORYLINE are not at all hokey and come off as quite coherent, which would have been a very difficult task as readers of the book(s) are well-aware.

I much appreciated the fact that the story remains close to the book(s), with few cuts and/or ommissions. Of course, this has made for a lengthy film, but one which will not bore you at all.

My final critique of the film is that the same primary theme composition is used for all three films -- man, I got REALLY tired of that filmscore, even though other facets of it are brilliant. It's the up-front french horn one that I'm speaking of.

In the end, this is a very fine film, not necessarily for smaller kids, but A-O-K for teens. A last comment, don't waste time or money watching the FULL-SCREEN edition -- I've watched it that way (all three films) and you lose 2-stars when you do! This one MUST be viewed in widescreen only!",1194220800,3,4270,4.7028112449799195

1453285,5,B00005JKZU,"Once again, just brilliant!
My favourite is an extra scene at the end of Two Towers where the trees smash the Orcs that fled into Farngorn Forest after Isengard was destroyed by the Ents. A bit of their own medicine!
Really a good movie!",1190851200,,237,4.409090909090909
1453286,5,B00005JKZU,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when ""The Two Towers"" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.

""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, which is warping our dear hobbit out of his own mind. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play ""Gandalf 2.0,"" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.

As with the first film, it's worth spending a little extra to see the extended version -- loads of behind-the-scenes material, and lots of scenes seamlessly pasted back in. Yeah, some of them are battle scenes, but we also have more exposition on Eowyn, backstory on the troubled Faramir and his late brother, and Merry and Pippin spending time with the Ents... and experiencing some personal growth. Literally.

The journey continues in ""The Two Towers,"" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1188259200,,4021,5.0406626506024095

1453406,5,B00005JKZU,"This film starts at a running speed and never stops.  From watching Gandalf battle the demonic balrog to the collapse of Isengarde and everything else in between, there is hardly room to catch your breath - and it is wonderful.  Add to the surviving fellowship a new and wonderful group of people, the Riders of Rohan, who I have always been fond of - and of course the gnarly old Ents: tree people who are shepherds of the trees, keeping them in order, in their places in the forest.

The climax of the film is the huge double battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengarde.  I have found it most interesting that in sopite of talk of wizards and Elves, Tolkien's world is not one of magic. Elves seem to possess great longevity, but also an advanced technology implied rather than discussed.  And while there is a certain power among wizards, an example of Saurman's ""magic"" is no more mysterious than the ability to utilize gunpowder, no doubt high tech to Middle Earthers, and mysterious enough to seem magical.  (In the books, the Elves explained to Sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them)

For me, the battle of helm's Deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action.

As usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of Faramir.  This was not the Faramir of Tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized.  But also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking.

The principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess Eowyn, her Uncle King Theoden, her brother Eomer, and the slithery traitor, ""Wormtongue"".  And, of course, the ruined Hobbit known by all as ""Gollum"".  Gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a CGI character, brilliantly ""portrayed"" by Andy Serkis.

Once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again.  This extended version is much more Tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun.",1171843200,4,2189,4.693717277486911

I am NOT a couch potato.

Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was movie making at its best. Especially considering that the movie had very high standards to live up to after more than 50 years of building such a loyal, cult following of the classic J.R.R. Tolkien book.

Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Wizards, Orcs all co-surviving, albeit without much harmony, in Middle Earth. And all lust for the great Ring of Power made by the Dark Lord Sauron. But only little Frodo Baggins controls its Destiny. Thus is the 9-hour epic saga of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

There is a terrific list of A-list actors giving A-list performances. It's a long one: Therefore, most notably you have Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum (what a performance!), Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli. I know. I know....How could I not mention Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler and all the others??? Well, that's the point. The whole cast was awesome. Even the no-names that played Orcs.

Kudos to Director Peter Jackson for going beyond the Hollywood standard of 120 minutes to tell each chapter of the story. Jackson kept a lot of the character development that usually isn't transferred from novel to movie adaptation. And Jackson was a master not just at directing his cast, but at getting the special effects perfect. The Lord of the Rings movie adaptation will be as classic as the novel because of Jackson.

Instead of providing discreetly separate copies of theatrical and extended versions as with the 4-disker, apparently only the theatrical version is wholly present on this set and in the case of the extended edition, seamless branching accesses different areas of the disc, inserting extended footage into the theatrical version on the fly (back and forth, back and forth...). In theory this shuttling from one area to another is imperceptible to the viewer, although one does wonder about player wear and tear that this playback method must introduce.

Perhaps hi-end DVD players genuinely do provide a seamless experience, unfortunately this is not true of my players (one computer DVD drive, one stand-alone). There are significant freeze-frame pauses every time the player jumps to access a remote section of film. No, this is far from ""seamless,"" rather, it is very distracting.

A much lesser complaint, although one still worth mentioning, is the physical condition of the two disks in the set that I bought: Side A of disk 1 was marred to a surprising degree with scuffs and scratches, looking much more like a used video rental than a new disk. Disk 2 was also marred but with an odd pitted mottling in one area. Even more surprising is how these defects don't appear to impact playback-- for example, the theatrical version plays without incident. I should also note that I did not purchase this set from Amazon, however I certainly wish I had purchased the 4-disker through Amazon as originally planned.

Odds are I'll either buy the 4-disker for its superior features, or compile my own extended version on the computer to eliminate seamless-branching lag.

Lord of the Rings is quite a concept, originally brought forth by J.R.R. Tolkien decades ago. Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read. Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it. If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy.

The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies. Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long.

A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better.

1453818,5,B00005JKZU,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when ""The Two Towers"" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.

""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play ""Gandalf 2.0,"" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.

This edition contains both versions of the movie -- the original, shorter theatrical version, and the second extended edition with lots of extra footage. While the first one has nostalgia value, the second is undoubtedly the best.

The extra scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, although the handling of the Faramir character comes as a mild shock. Extra scenes are inserted, like Merry and Pippin enjoying the ents' hospitality. There is also a special documentary filmed behind the scenes, apparently to draw in completists who need everything made about ""Lord of the Rings.""

The journey continues in ""The Two Towers,"" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1153526400,,4224,5.0706051873198845

Instead, I'd like to pay tribute to Tolkien, whose imagination sowed the seed that has grown into the Great Tree of this trilogy and its cultural shade.

(I know, I used the same intro for my other LOTR extended scenes review.)  Artistic license continues, as Jackson, Walsh and Boyens reduce ""huorns"" to ""trees.""  Small potatos.  I was glad to see the march of the ents extended, and the involvement of Fangorn at Helm's Deep was missing from the theater-length production, so good addition on that score as well.  Let's applaud the writers for including Arwen & Aragorn throughout the film (Tolkien relegated it to an appendix, despite its deeply personal importance to him), and we should give them high-five for the ""Forth Eorlingas"" sequence.  I've never experienced goosebumps from the glory of a battle scene before--not even while watching ""Gladiator.""  Kudos.

Smeagol really makes the movie.  He has the best lines, best facial expressions, best mannerisms, weirdest demeanor (girls, don't pity him--""he's a villain""--all the girls that watch with me think he's cute), etc.  I suppose the smash-hit Smeagol phenomenon is a bit odd, given that he's only half-real.  So props to Andy Serkis (who I guess was himself a prop) and the digital design crew.

WHEN you buy this, do yourself a favor and spend a wintery day off watching the bonus discs in front of a roaring fire.  Masterfully done, all of it.

As Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas go forth on a rescue mission to save Merry and Pippin, now prisoners of the bloodthirsty Uruk-Hai, the burden of the One Ring grows heavier on little Frodo Baggins. His only comfort and support on his long journey to Mordor is the steadfast faith and loyalty of his best friend, Samwise Gamgee. When the Hobbit pair fall under attack by a former ring-bearer, the creature Gollum, they soon enlist his aid as a guide on their quest. But can he be trusted? For 500 years, the ring poisoned Gollum's mind. Now, Gollum is a broken soul. He struggles between a desire for redemption and a lust for ""the precious."" Frodo seeks to reform the creature in order to gain hope for his own struggle with the ring, but Sam despises the pitiful Gollum and cannot understand Frodo's need to show mercy. Meanwhile, our other two Hobbit heroes, Merry and Pippin, seize an opportunity for freedom and soon find themselves consorting with an entirely new type of creature, the towering Ents, who could provide great help against the evil wizard Saruman and his army. Following their own course, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas soon find themselves reunited with an old friend and helping defend a king's stronghold, Helm's Deep, from Sauron's deadly forces. The culmination is a thrilling battle with little hope of victory, and yet it is only the beginning of Sauron's war on mankind and the freedom of Middle Earth!

Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second installment of a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is difficult to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. However, note must be made that this second, darker, scarier film in the saga introduces the entirely digital creature Gollum as a major part of the principal cast brought stunningly to life with amazingly realistic computer effects and the wonderful talent of Andy Serkis. This installment also introduces one of the few female characters in the trilogy, the fierce but lovely Eowyn, played with great warmth and believability by Miranda Otto. In addition to the outstanding cast, the visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The creatures are amazing, the battles are astounding and intense, and at the heart of it all is a message to never give up, whether you are defending an entire kingdom or one single soul. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 2 featurettes on the making of the film, 8 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a haunting music video by Emiliana Torrini, a charming short film called ""The Long and the Short of It"" by Sean Astin, a featurette on the making of ""The Long and the Short of It,"" a preview of the third film in the trilogy (Return of the King) and its video game, and, believe it or not, a preview of the extended edition of the Two Towers DVD. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the ""preferred versions."" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose. Fantastic films!

In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, ""The Hobbit."" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for ""Lord of the Rings"" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Pirates of the Caribbean, Army of Darkness, Fantasia, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out a much younger Sean Astin in ""The Goonies,"" another of my all-time favorite films, and pick up Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" another extraordinary achievement!",1145232000,3,5470,4.849197860962567
1453824,4,B00005JKZU,"Unlike the Empire Strikes Back or the Godfather Part II which can stand on its own, the Two Towers in many ways needs its preceeding and succeeding films Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. The filmmakers do an admirable job of bringing the story to life and make a couple decisions that surely angered fans but all in all it's a great film with one of the best achievements in CG characters and a cool end battle.

We follow 3 distinct storylines: Frodo and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor with the Ring, only now they have a companion in Gollum, an incredibly skinny and mentally messed up creature who happens to have another personality. 2nd story is Pippin and Merry who were captured by Uruk-Hai and have to deal with the Ents, talking trees, for help. 3rd story is Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli tracking down the Hobbits only to end up in Rohan and have to defend a big place named Helm's Deep against at least 10,000 Uruk-Hai.

They're have been several advancements in the realm of digital effects: the water tentacle in the Abyss, the T-1000 in Terminator 2, living dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and bullet time from the Matrix. Well add Gollum to the list as he's not only one of the best achievements in visual effects but he can actually act on screen. It's helped by Andy Serkis whose movements were digitally recorded by computer and animators made it look like Gollum. Plus his voice is really cool, I do it plenty of times at home.

One of the big controversies(among fans anyway) was moving Frodo and Sam's encounter with a big spider named Shelob to film 3, Return of the King. Yeah it's at the end of Two Towers book but chronologically it's supposed to be in film 3, during the Pelennor Fields battle. If it was here, people would go ""hey wait a minute! Shelob is not after Helm's Deep, it's during the battle at Minas Tirith!"" You can see how fan devotion can sometimes have its problems.

It is the middle film so it's a bit more difficult than Film 1 or 3. It doesn't really have a proper beginning and the ending is slightly cliffhanger-esque. But there's very little to complain such as the CG, music and the characters. Although the Warg attack looks very low budget. All in all, Fellowship's probably my favorite of the 3 with some of the best looking locations but this film does have Gollum and Helm's Deep and the hotness that is Mirando Otto so all is well.

It helps to watch the films in order as while Two Towers isn't terrible by any means, its inability as a stand alone film is a flaw.",1144540800,,2538,4.484848484848484
1453825,5,B00005JKZU,"Everything that came as a shock last December, when ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was released, we're ready for now: the surging, unfamiliar New Zealand landscapes that serve so well as Middle-earth, the way director Peter Jackson creates a privileged aura of legend while propelling the story forward, the preposterous rightness of Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and - really, who knew? - Liv Tyler as Arwen.

The miracle is that ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' is better: tighter, smarter, funnier, and graced with a more realized sense of epochs shifting on the actions of smallish individuals. It builds cleanly toward the climactic battle of Helm's Deep instead of constantly pausing, as ''Fellowship'' did, for a series of donnybrooks. And it introduces a character who, in Jackson's imagining of him, provides the one thing Tolkien never had much use for: dramatic irony.

That character is Gollum, and he catches up with Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) early on in the new movie. Since the Fellowship abruptly splintered at the end of the last installment, ''Towers'' shuttles back and forth between the group's constituent parts. Pressing into the country of Rohan to confront the armies of bad-seed wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) are the three warriors: human Aragorn (Mortensen, eye candy for the ladies), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom, ditto for the teenage girls), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies, comic relief for everyone else).

Spare-wheel hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are captives of Saruman's orcs until they are rescued by Treebeard the Ent, who is perhaps best described as the apple tree from ''The Wizard of Oz'' minus the sociopathic urges. Frodo and Sam, of course, are bound for Mordor to drop Sauron's one true Ring of power into the fires in which it was forged. Since AAAdoesn't exactly provide a Triptik for this sort of thing, the two are forced to rely on the guidance of Gollum, the slimy, devolved flapdoodle who lost the Ring to Frodo's Uncle Bilbo back in ''The Hobbit'' and who has been lusting slurpily after his ''precious'' ever since.

Gollum is a computer-generated character, and your heart may sink when he first waddles into sight: with his perfectly mottled skin, street-lamp eyes, and deftly rendered strands of lank hair, he pulls the film in the direction of a high-end video game. But the kindness with which Frodo treats Gollum short-circuits the creature's rage and leads to some marvelously bipolar dialogues between his good and evil sides. Gollum's voice and movements are provided by Andy Serkis, and it's a tribute to the actor that by the time ''Towers'' comes crashing to a close, we've accepted Gollum as a full-time member of the crew - and by far the most interestingly conflicted.

True to Tolkien, everyone else is stalwart in heart and deed, and thus a bit of a stick. Characters don't speak in ''Lord of the Rings,'' they declaim, and all that earnestness might pall if the scope of ''Towers'' weren't so convincingly epic. The audience jaws start dropping from the very first scene, which rewinds to Gandalf's battle with the Balrog from ''Fellowship'' but this time plunges over the cliff with the combatants as they wrassle and smite in midair.

It's a sequence most movies would save as a capper; Jackson serving it up before the opening credits roll is just his waggish way of reminding you who's boss.

The main action in ''Towers'' centers on the kingdom of Rohan, which is being assaulted by the combined armies of Sauron and Saruman as a prelude to a full-on conquest of Middle-earth. King Theoden (Bernard Hill) is under the spell of evil adviser Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) - do you deserve to be king if you hire an adviser named Grima Wormtongue? - the prince is dead, his cousin Eomer (Karl Urban) exiled, and Eomer's tough-but-tender sister Eowyn (Miranda Otto) besieged by Grima's unwanted attentions.

When Aragorn and the others arrive to buck up the Rohanians' esprit de corps, he and Eowyn exchange a few heavy-lidded looks - and a good thing, too, since Otto is the most warm-blooded actress to wander into these movies yet. Aragorn's heart, though, remains with faraway elf princess Arwen, and, anyway, who has time for first dates when the armies of the night are approaching in all their terrible computer-generated splendor?

Jackson is one of the very few directors able to fluently combine live-action footage and digital animation, and he has a gift for pop-Wagnerian grandeur that reclaims cinema's primal power. The skirmish midway through between the heroes and Saruman's hyena-riding troops rivals Kurosawa's desperate choreography, and the Helm's Deep wrap-up is as clear as a military diagram and a frightening, panicky chaos.

It's all hooey, of course - unless you're an adolescent or a Tolkien addict, you have to admit this - but it's hooey with conviction, muscle, and wit, and for the film's three hours you're raised up into the kind of exalted storytelling that the ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter'' movies only feebly promise. George Lucas should watch this and hang his head in shame.

A final thought: ''Towers'' is a war film when all is said and done and some will take that all the way to the metaphorical bank. Is it a coincidence that the movie appears as America tries to reinvent itself as a lean, mean aggression machine? Well, yes, it is. In point of fact, ''The Lord of the Rings'' makes a lousy recruiting poster, devoted as it is to the notion that war is hell on Middle-earth.

Anyway, the major structural problem with the story has always been that its archvillain, Sauron, is a smoke-and-mirrors bugaboo - a barely anthropomorphized stand-in for whatever you think is wrong with the world. Some have decoded him as Hitler, while others believe Tolkien's gripe is against the modern industrialist state. If you want to see Saddam Hussein in that fiery eye of Mordor, be my guest - if you squint, Christopher Lee's Saruman might even pass for Osama bin Laden - but keep in mind that it would be just as easy for someone else to see George W. Bush.",1143590400,4,6155,4.93050193050193
1453826,3,B00005JKZU,"After getting through the extended version of Fellowship with no prior interest or knowlege of these films I felt I was prepared well enough for the long ""Part II"" of this series, The Two Towers.

Well, to be honest I was a little underwhelmed by this movie overall and it's long length started to make itself felt towards the end.  The first film was also long but I didn't ""feel"" that it was too long because it moved with more coherency and things unfolded more naturally.  This film jumped around a lot and that's OK as long as things are moving along nicely and the story advances during these scene jumps.  Too often, I felt that the individual stories in this film didn't really have anywhere to go or they took too long to get there.  It had points where it was truly getting dull... not too much but enough to notice it.  There were times that I found myself asking ""where is this going?"" or ""this side-plot had better mean something really important to be dragging like this.""  Still, the movie did advance the story enough that it is worthwhile to see.  Just expect it to feel more dragged out than the first film.

Here is a summary:

GOOD:

- A few good twists and pot shake-ups that I liked.

- Some of the new characters are pretty solid.

- Gollum got a good amount of screen time and I like him.... I even feel sorry for him sometimes!

- An epic battle at the end with some wild action.

- Solid effects and camera work as always!

BAD:

- Stupid side story with Merry, Pippin, & the ""alive"" trees.  The trees are cool and important but this side story received WAY too much screen time and was boring.

- More cases of characters that you think are dead/killed only to reappear later...dont want to spoil it so no names will be mentioned here!

- Frodo and Sam didn't gain much ground and did not get much screen time in this film.  They really didn't ""do"" very much.

I lament that all is made with computor images, and not through stop motion
technique using real models. A computor image can be very realistically
made, but still lacks a certain something, a sense of real
manifested mass and presence. One of the last great stop motion creatures
used on screen was the dragon in the movie Dragonslayer; is was very
advanced and had a computorized mechanism called Go Motion to give it
carefully adjusted movements. Here the computor had, as it should, a
supporting role, instead of totally taking over. It is a pity that this
branch of effects work was abandoned for the less costly CGI. Because the
use of a model gives by itself a sense of presence on the screen, that can't
fully be achieved with the illusion of the computor image. A real model
brings an actuality of sharpness to movements, forms, colors, lights and
shadows. The continuation of the Go Motion technique would have been an
investment for the future, and led to many interesting discoveries
in anatomical and engineering mechanics, developed the knowledge of hard
and elastic complex materials, and would have been a major factor in the

1453957,5,B00005JKZU,"I have seen all three of the Extended DVD Editions of Lord of the Rings, and
I can't help but ask the following questions:

How could a film team in New Zeeland, without prior experience of advanced
film making, be able to create the mastodont Lord of the Rings film trilogy?
How could Peter Jackson, who previously had done low budget splatter films
like Bad Taste and Braindead, pull this off? I am baffled.

How could this massive amount of visual material be created and put together
in such a comparably short time? How could it all be coordinated and
harmonized into such a consistent whole? How could the genuine feeling of
culture and history of a whole world be created in that short time? It
doesn't add up. It's not natural. And it doesn't matter that the film crew
in the extra documentary material on the DVDs tell us how dedicated and hard
they worked; it still doesn't add up. I am telling you, it ain't natural.
There must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in the
making, or perhaps Tolkien's spirit coordinated the work.

How could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles, and
acted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors?
And all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work.
Incomprehensible. Supermundane forces must have played a part .

I can see some minor weak points in the films, but on the whole they stand
as a world on its own, above the reach of criticism. As with the books my
favorite is The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers feels a little like
transportation (I thought the weakest part here was the Ent. He felt
unconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics and
expressions, like an illustration from a children's book. And some of
the orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses.)
When reading the books I imagine characters and environments a little
differently, more mundane down to earth, with ordinary persons put in
extraordinary situations, so that there becomes a strong contrast. For
example, the Shire countryside being mellow in tone, to contrast more with
the magic glimmering of the Elven world. In the film, all the main
characters glow with charisma, and everything is really intense, from colors
to acting. But that is alright. It is still very well done. And there is no
definite way, because everyone who reads the books has his or her personal
vision.
The Return of the King has grown upon me, and it is just as great as the
first film, but in a different way; it has grand beauty within the context
of war. Oooh, and that green dress Arwen is wearing at the wedding! A color
from beyond this world!

The Extended Editions have many great scenes added, especially in The Return
of the King. Who can forget the episode with Gandalf and Pipin atop Minas
Tirith, by the white tree, talking of days gone past? Or the Mouth of
Sauron!?

The extra material is very generous. Sometimes a little too generous,
because every magic trick is revealed.  But if you are yourself an artist,
or work with film, it is indispensible information, and very enjoyable to
watch.
Those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break up
when it was all over. I can imagine the making of these films was a burnout
for some, difficult to top off. To them I can say that, the cosmos is
limitless, and there is always some new beauty around the corner.",1142812800,3,3429,4.620689655172414

I asked for the three platinum edition LOR box sets for Christmas, when I did not get them I bought them myself (in a fit of uncharecteristic indulgence).

 In taking the production apart in the making discs, I was given a new respect and deeper awe of how the films were crafted from conception to cutting room.  The ingenuity of P Jackson and his team astounded me.  In Fellowship, you must see how the troll scene was planned out(it was completely digitized, and put in a 3d simulation, so Peter Jackson could walk around an empty room, with virtual reality goggles on, and see and plan the camera angles -wild). I was enchanted all over again.

1453964,5,B00005JKZU,"A great film, not to be missed. The music is wonderful and the special effects are great. In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster. The cast is good. Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas. In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character. Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him extra screen time.

The movie does have its faults. Am I the only one who thought the tactics used in the defense of Helm's Deep were absurd?  The whole point of a defensive wall is to give you the chance to kill the enemy before he gets over the parapet.  You don't wait until he climbs over to use your sword on him.  Maybe I know too much about how actual medieval warfare was fought.

As to the extra shots in the DVD, the scene with Denethor in Osgiliath is so good that I simply cannot believe it was left out of the original cut.  On the other hand, with some scenes I tend to agree with the original decision not to use it.

The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism. They also have a more serious message. Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside. This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up. Is this really what we want? Is it making us happier? Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.",1139011200,,1534,4.28719723183391

1454106,5,B00005JKZU,"Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings affected me greatly when I first read it.  It has, over time, become my favorite novel, because of and in spite of its flaws.  Many of the 'flaws' as I perceive them happen in ""The Two Towers,"" which has the unfortunate distinction of being the ""middle child"" of the trilogy.  The story as written by Tolkien has no beginning or end, but overflows with ""middle,"" with some great exposition and action.  The same can be said for Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers,"" as many of it's flaws are story related.  Like its literary namesake, the film has no real beginning, with the action beginning in Frodo Baggins' dream of Gandalf the wizard.  It also has no end, although there is definitely a rising of action and a climax, nicely capped by Sam's inspirational monologue.

""Towers"" introduces us to the land of Rohan, home of the Rohirrim, a race of men who breed and raise the finest horses in all of Middle Earth.  Their King, Theoden, has been ensnared by the voice of Saruman, and his mind is not his own.  He is watched by Grima Wormtongue, an agent of Saruman, who feeds lies into Theoden's ear.  Theoden's nice, Eowyn, is overcome with grief for her uncle's loss, and her brother. Eomer, has been banished from Rohan for attempting to resist Grima's power.  Aragorn, the elf Legolas, and Gimli the dwarf all come to Rohan, seeing that it is taken by darkness and overcome with despair.  With the help of an old friend, they attempt to free Theoden and rally the Rohirrim.

Meanwhile, hobbits Merry and Pippin escape the clutches of the orcs and Uruk-Hai, only to meet a more mysterious creature.  Sam and Frodo have ensnared a tour guide as they trek closer to Mordor.  Faramir, brother of Boromir, crosses their path and discovers that they have the one ring and that they knew Boromir, whose corpse he saw in a dream.

The great parts of this movie are the introductions to new characters.  This initially seems daunting, as we already know of 12 or so characters tha are directly related to the story.  Karl Urban, only briefly seen as Eomer of Rohan, is very well cast and delivers a nice performance.  Bernard Hill is excellent as King Theoden.  Miranda Otto is tough but endearing as Eowyn.  Brad Dourif's Grima is nicely creepy.  The returning stars shine as well, especially Andy Serkis as Gollum (finally seen in full view), Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Sean Astin as Sam.

The extended version gives some extra detail, including scenes of brothers Faramir and Boromir in flashback, extra battle scenes, and more of Grima Wormtongue's trickery.  As with the extended edition of Fellowship, the plot is enhanced by these added scenes.  Also similar to Fellowship, the battles may be too intense for youngsters.  On the whole, though, Jackson's unique vision and style , his excellent cast, the extraordinary effects, the stunning cinematography, the one of a kind prouction design, and Howard Shore's score make this a gem.

Aragorn and the others are talking with some ruler about Christopher Lee's character(whose name I forget) invading, Frodo and Sam are just talking over and over to Gollum that he should be on their side, and Merry and Pip are talking with some giant trees to help them fight Christopher Lee's character.

Things were dreamed and accomplished that would have seemed ridiculous to most film directors. PJ once again takes the viewer directly INTO middle earth. I mean, i've read the books at least 15 times in my life, and the one thing that strikes me most about these movies is the complete fidelity to Tolkien's vision of Middle earth. True, the plot has been tweaked, but the essential elements of the story are still there.

1454111,5,B00005JKZU,"I love this installment. It is possibly my favorite. I am especially fond of Theoden. His dialogue is golden. Upon the death of his son, his grief is poignant. ""Simbelmne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see that last days of my house.""

Gandalf consoles him. ""Thodred's death was not of your making.""

Theoden continues to grieve. ""No parent should have to bury their child."" Then he begins to sob bitterly.

Later, Theoden has steeled himself for the coming onslaught and dons his armor. His words draw strongly from Tolkien. ""Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.""

From text of The Two Towers it runs as follows:

Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?
Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?
Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?
They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.
Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,
Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?

It is as though he is quoting from the oral tradition of his people.

In addition to all of this there are so many wonderful elements in these films.

We have the race across Rohan by Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn to rescue Merry and Pippen. Aragon's tracking and recreation of the events that enable the hobbits to escape their captors is masterful in its execution.

Gimli and Legolas are wonderful.

Aragorn is one of the Kings of Old!

Eowyn longs for death and valor and will pierce your heart!

Gollum is exceptional.

Sure. It really is good cinema!

Can I forgive Jackson's butchering of the character of Faramir? OK. The sequence with Boromir and Faramir together is wonderful. It explains quite a bit.

1454261,4,B00005JKZU,"I enjoy watching this great trilogy of my favorite story.  It really brings the book to life.  I appreciate the care that was taken to do honor to Tolkien's work.

Rave reviews are boring and have nothing creative about them unless they have some suggestions for improvement.  There are no perfect movies, and it is not good enough to just sit there and clap if you are a reviewer.

One suggestion I have about this movie in particular, the second of the series, is to work harder at realism in the battle scenes.  There was a powerful impression that the ""good guys"" killed enemies at will and were infinitely more skillful at war than the ""bad guys"", who were just basically paper dolls to knock down, no matter how ferocious the costume.

Along with that, more than once there were battle scenes that looked very bleak for the heroes (Helm's Deep and the ambush by the wargs), and then all of a sudden the battle was over and the enemies were completely gone.  That's nice, but what happened to them all?  One moment the enemies are numerous and menacing, and the next moment they are utterly destroyed, whoosh, gone.

I have to commend the movie for one seemingly minor detail that was done excellently.  As the enemies approached Helm's Deep, several times we watched the women and children react to the noise that was being made by the attackers.  That careful attention to detail made the scene more powerful, because we could picture ourselves affected by the coming menace.

There were a few times when I had to wonder if the film script had deviated from the book.  I would have to go back and re-read the book to know for sure, because I haven't read it in a number of years.  I'd have to consider any such deviations to be negatives, because I revere the book.

It's like changing the Ten Commandments to suit yourself, like saying to get rid of ""Thou shalt not covet"" and replace it with ""Thou shalt not have an abortion"", or changing ""Thou shalt not have any idols"" to ""Thou shalt not commit homosexual acts"".  I realize that there are a lot of people who would like to add commandments against abortion and homosexuality, but you don't mess with the words of the master.  That's how I feel about Tolkien.

Was Theoden really ""possessed by"" Saruman?  Did Gandalf really perform an exorcism on Theoden, as he did in the movie?  Were Frodo and Sam really taken all the way to Osgiliath (or wherever that battle was) before being released by Faramir?  Notice how I use the word ""really"" as if Tolkien's book is a history, not a novel.  Did Frodo, while a captive of Faramir, really have a face to face confrontation with a flying Nazgul during which he almost put on the ring until Sam stopped him?

I'll have to read the book again to make sure I have all the details right.  Don't mess with my Tolkien.",1128124800,,2815,4.526732673267326

Having seen the Toronto premier, I must say that I was very pleased with the Two Towers. It is not only spectacular in it's SFX and set design, it provides us characters, both CGI and human, that are interesting. However, it may upset (not me though) LOTR junkies because it is not completely faithful to the book.

The first scenes of the movie had me hooked, where they go back to the battle between Gandalf and the Demonic Balrog under the mines of Moria. As in the first book, Gandalf seems to be lost, but they extend the battle as the two mighty characters seem to fall to the center of the earth. It is an amazing scene that will have your mouth gaping. However, that is shown as a dream sequence to Frodo/Sam's quest to get to Mount Doom to destroy the ring of power.

The other plotline has Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli tracking a party of Uruk-hai who have kidnapped Merry and Pippen (the other two Hobbits). However, by the time they reach them, all the orcs are killed by the Riders of the Rohiddim, soldiers of a Kingdom called Rohan. The party discover that the hobbits were not killed but hid in the mysterious Fangorn forest, a mystic place that mortals dare not enter. They meet up with Gandalf in the forest and head to Rohan, since he has found the hobbits and left them in the protection of the Ents, a tree race that protects Fangorn.

In the capital of Rohan, they find out about Saruman and Isengards march of 10000 orcs to destroy their land. The King is under the spell of an evil sage named Grim Wormtongue and Gandalf breaks the spell. Wormtongue is banished and heads to his true master, Saruman. The Rohan's abanddon their city and head towards Helm's Deep, their siege fort, where they will make their last stand. Saruman, knowing this, sends his troops there, hoping to block them off and destroy Rohan. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes to find the King's nephew Eomer, who was banished by the King while he was under the spell of Wormtongue.

Meanwhile Merry and Pippen meet Treebeard, one of the oldest Ents. They try to convince him that Saruman has become evil but the Ents have no interest in joining the war, until they find out that Saruman is destroying the forests to run his great underground steel mill. They have a change of heart and prepare for the siege on Isengard.

Finally, Frodo meets and captures Gollum, the adversary of Bilbo Baggins in the book ""The Hobbit"". As they prepare to finish him off, Gollum tells them that they cannot enter Mordor because Sauron has built a giant gate and offers an alternative way in. During this way, they fall in between a conflict between the Harzad (servants of Sauron) and the fighters of Gondor. They are captured by Faramir, the brother of Boromir and will be taken to Miras Tinir to have the ring given to his father to fight the war.

As you can see, the plot is dense but Director/Writer Peter Jackson fills in much of the holes. He also adds parts that are not in the novel, such as the love triangle between Aragorn, Eowyn and Arwen. Also, in the second part, I don't remember the Elves escaping from Rivendell to their ancient homeland of Valoria across the sea, nor do I remember a legion of Elves under Haldir going to assist the Rohan's defenses, but for me, these were not negatives, but helped with the plot. As well, in the book, the first half is devoted to Helm's Deep and Isengard, while the second half is the quest. It is broken up here, but IMO, that was a good thing since JRR's way would have bored people cinematically.

Other differences from the book is that Aragorn and his party do not meet up with the Ents and the Hobbits in Isengard and the movie ends about 50 pages before the novel does and you do not get to meet ""her"" (LOTR fans will know what I'm talking about).

For those who have not read the novels, there maybe some confusion where characters or people appear out of nowhere, but were discussed in the book (like the Ents), or Faramir happening to be the brother of Boromir. I also suggest that those who have not seen the original LOTR: FOTR or watched in a while, rent it againt to be refreshed.

Of the the new characters, Smeagol-Gollum is the best. Jackson makes Smeagol pathetic enough to be sympathetic to the audience (especially with his big eyes and naive childish attitude), but makes Gollum evil enough to make him seem like a real threat. Smeagol also is the best CGI character I've seen to date. After a few minutes, you would think that he existed in real life. Andy Serkis does an amazing job with the voice. John Rhys-Davis does the best here, injecting humor into his Gimli character (the reference to Dwarf tossing is timeless) and with the towering voice of Treebeard. Other new characters that support the movie well are Karl Urban who plays Eomer, David Wenham who plays Faramir and Brad Dourif who plays the slimy Grima Wormtongue.

I was not impressed with Miranda Otto as Eowyn, mostly because she is supposed to have major chemistry with Aragorn (Viggo Mortesen) but doesn't and I was also unhappy with Frodo, because in the novel, he goes from fresh faced no-nothing to a wiser person, but Jackson instead played up his ""turmoil"" with the ring. He is also supposed to have a fatherly role with Smeagol-Gollum, but it does not come through on screen.

Finally, the battle scenes....Yes they are amazing and tremendous to take in, but it was sensory overload at times. It just keeps going and going and becomes wearisome after a while. But don't get me wrong, this was a minor complaint. I know this movie is supposed to be darker than the first movie, but let me tell you, it made Gimli's jokes all that funnier.

Overall, this is probably the ""Don't miss"" movie of the Christmas season. I give Peter Jackson and the whole crew kudos for making a movie that will both entertain and memorable....Rating: B",1120694400,,5867,4.555028462998102

1454375,5,B00005JKZU,"`The Two Towers' is the second of the three movies capturing the novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.

It is impossible to speak of any one of the three movies by themselves as they do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent films related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' was a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.

Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book `The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in `Lord of the Rings'. Minas Morgul plays a much bigger role in the middle of the story than does Sauron's stronghold. Part of this change of tower may be due to the fact that some of the action involving Minas Morgul was moved to the third movie, `The Return of the King'.

The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.

I have read `The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a part of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.

In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.

Even though `The Two Towers' is the middle third of a very long three part movie, it really has a much more satisfying ending than `The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.

1454377,5,B00005JKZU,"THe Two Towers is the second part of Peter Jackson's acclaimed adaption of JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  The Journey continues in this movie.  Beginning with beautiful scenic shots of the moutains of the Middle-Earth, the Two Towers has climactic battles, struggles of will, moments of pure joy and beauty.  Frodo and Sam continue to scratch their way to Mordor, pursued not just by agents of the Dark Lord but by Gollum, slave to the lust of the ring.  Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-Hai and are hunted by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  The hunt takes Merry and Pippin to the center of Fanghorn Forrest in the company of the Ent Treebeard, a 14 foot tall walking talking tree.  The 3 hunters fall in the Rhohirram under the command of Eomer (Karl Urban), a culture of horse lords threatened by the evil wizard Saruman, with their king Theoden (Bernard Hill) enchanted by Saruman's agent Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).  Now on horseback, the 3 hunters encounter a resurrected Gandalf the White, now with power over Saruman.  They ride to free Theoden, where they encounter Theoden's beautiful and strong niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto).  Taking his people to the safety of Helm's Deep, Saruman sends his hordes after the king and in an impressive night battle, the Rohirram are aided by a contingent of Elven warriors (the biggest deviation by Jackson from the book). Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam encounter Faramir, the brother of Boromir on their way to Mordor led by Gollum.  While our heroes triumph at Helm's Deep, and Saruman is defeated, the menace of Mordor grows greater as Sam and Frodo move closer to the fulfillment of their quest. I found The Two Towers to be a beautiful and profoundly moving film.  The affects were amazing and the ability of Peter Jackson to combine live action, computer graphics and minature shots make this a great film.  Once again, this movie should have won an Academy Award and the fact that it didn't is almost a crime.",1115337600,3,1971,4.798816568047338

Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue their search for Merry and Pippin, they enter the kingdom of Rohan chasing after the Urah-Kai. They meet with riders of Rohan that where banded from the city by Wormtoung a survant of Saruman the White. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas learn that these riders destroyed the Urak-hia but did not notice the hobbits. They continue to find the remains of the Urah-kai in hopes of finding the two hobbits. Aragorn uses his leadership skills and found traces of the two hobbits that lead them into Fangorn Forest. The three travelers went warrily into the old dark forest.

In the forest they meet up with a wizard assuming he was Sarumon, and attempted to attack him. The wizard was to strong for the three of them, only after they realized they couldn't attack him the three realized he was Gandalf, their old friend. Gandalf leads them to the city of Rohan to the aid of King Theoden. King Theoden is be-spelled by Saruman the white, who now has a strong hold over him. Gandalf fights Saruman and free's Theoden from the spell. They meet Eoywen the neice of Theoden. Theoden then realizes he was betrayed by Wormtounge who was helping Saruman.

Theoden bans Wormtounge from Rohan and Gandalf informs him of the upcoming war with Saruman and Saruon. Theoden decides to the dismay of Gandalf to run into the mountains and hide at Helms Deap. Gandalf wishes Theoden to stay and fight, he leaves Rohan to search for more fighters. All the people of Rohan ride to Helms deep, on the way they are attacked by the wolves of isengard. Aragorn falls into a river and is assumed dead but the group must continue to Helms Deep. They later find that Aragorn is still alive, and continue prepairing for war.

To the suprize of the men of Helms Deep they see a group of elven warriors come to form another alliance. The Urak-hai shortly arrive after this and the war at helms deep begins. After fighting and several lives are lost and the fortress is taken over the King rides outs with Aragorn and the remaining men and elves and attack the urak-hai head on. They meet back up with Gandalf and win back Hemls Deep.

Merry and Pippin do not meet back up with the fellowship until the Return of the King, they meet Treetbeard, an ent, also known as shepards of the forest. He starts to take the two hobbits to the end of the forest so they can go home. Merry and Pippin convence Treebeard to take them the other direction closer to Isengard. Treebeard sees that the white wizard has torn down several of his trees, and is greatly disturbed by this. He calls the other ents and wakens the trees and attacks Isengard.

Frodo and Sam finally meat Gollum, and to Sams dislike Frodo orders Gollum to lead them to Mordor. Sam never trusts Gollum, who later plots to kill both him and Frodo to take the ring back as his own. On the way to Mordor the cross a swamp land called the dead marshes. They then go through a forest and meet the captin of Ithilien another son of the stuard of Gondor, Faramir. He attemps to take the ring to save Gondor but realizes that the ring does no good. He realizes Sam, Frodo, and Gollum and they continue to Mordor.

So I went back and viewed it again, just to be sure.

I was right.

It's overlong, overwritten, dark, and pointless.

The first Lord of the Rings (the Fellowship) I liked better.  There the characters were fresh, the scenery bright and varied, the plot silly but negligible.

Here the scenes are almost all DARK.  Perhaps this is thematic: the journey has reached its nadir.  But the unrelieved gloom goes on too long.  And the characters, though unusual (Gollum, the Ents), are tedious.

Even worse is the writing.  When Sam oh-so-ponderously speculates on whether he and Frodo will ever be remembered or written about, I can hear Peter Jackson and even J.R.R. Tolkein laughing up their baggy medieval sleeves.

This kind of self-referential in-joke may appeal to fanatics; to me it was just pointless preening.

The main problem for me--and it just gets worse in the third movie, the Return--is the silliness of the plot, here dragged out to torpid length.

As for battles, seen one seen 'em all.

Guys (almost always guys) hacking each other to bits.

1. The action is constantly moving among the three story lines (Legolas/Aragorn/Gimle; Merry and Pippin; Sam and Frodo) so there's never a chance to look at your watch or get the least bit bored.

2. This movie introduces all kinds of new characters. The best of these is Treebeard, brought to life through the voice of John Rhys-Davies. But the people of Rohan are fabulous...Eowyn, Eomer, Theoden...what a great family. And of course we meet Faramir and, in this EE, Denathor. And this film introduces the amazing CG creation, Gollum.

3. One of the best scenes of the three movies: Boromir reclaiming Osgiliath for Gondor. How COULD they have left this scene out of the theaterical release?

4. The best ""goose-bump"" moment in the trilogy--Eomer and Gandalf leading the charge into Helm's Deep. The second best ""goose-bump"" moment in the trilogy...the elves marching into Helm's Deep under the leadership of the mighty cape sweeping Haldir.

5. The best battles in the trilogy...the Warg battle and the ultimate...""The Battle of Helm's Deep."" Let me explain why I prefer this battle to Pelannor Fields....I feel a greater personal connectedness to those who are fighting at Helm's Deep. We've spent time in the city, seen the faces of the people of Edoras, seen their hardships. By contrast, we hardly catch a glimpse of the people of Minis Tirith before their city is under seige. Don't get me wrong...I love both films. I just love this one a little more!

1454615,4,B00005JKZU,"`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The DVD is the wide screen theatrical release edition featuring the theatrical release of the film and an additional disk with some special features.

It covers two discs with a running time of almost three hours; `Two Towers' is an incredible sequel to `Fellowship of the Ring.' For the first time, viewers get to see Gollum in the flesh so to speak. The animated character acted by Andy Serkis definitely steals the show with the awesome visual affects, dialogue, and contrary emotions this complicated character has. The film continues where `Fellowship' left off but propels the story forward at an amazing pace.

We are indulged in the scenery of Rohan and the immense Battle of Helm's Deep but also are exposed to the first appearance of the Ents who are living, sentient tree people. `Two Towers' also brings the characters of Merry and Pippin to the forefront allowing actors Billy Boyd and Dominic Monahan to shine. Of course, the story of Frodo and Sam's friendship entwined with the journey to destroy the Ring of Power plays a major role and continues to develop.

True fans of the novels and first film will especially enjoy this DVD. Retailing at $17.99 the DVD is a good buy but unfortunately falls short in the special features department. The special features gems include Sean Astin's short film, `The Long and Short of It' and the trailer for `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.'

If the extended version of `Fellowship' is any indicator, `Two Towers: Extended Version' will be a DVD everyone must add to their collection.

1454759,5,B00005JKZU,"One of the things I love about the LOTR series is it's ability to captivate people who previously were unable to fathom the appeal of fantasy.  People like my dad and sister, for example.  You don't have to read the books (although they're great too), you don't have to be into fantasy novels.  All you need is an acute sense of justice, beauty and imagination.  I have seen these movies appeal to jocks, activists, computer geeks, artists, soccer moms, and old men, as well as all races, genders, sexual orientations, income levels, and countries of origin.  The movies seem to appeal to us on a visceral level, hearkening back to some imaginary time everyone seems to remember when things were purer and less complicated, and good and evil were palpable, tangible things more easily understood.

Peter Jackson saw that Tolkein, in the tradition of Shakespere, had distilled Western Civilisation (what's left of it anyhow) and human desire into a kind of fable epic, a fairy-tale novel without allegory or trite moralisation, and he wanted to bring it to life in a way unparallelled by anything that we have yet seen or heard tell of.  What's more, he wanted to do so in a way that would unselfishly share the beauty of the stories with everyone willing to invest the time while staying true to the source material.

If you have seen these movies, and are curious as to how they could possibly have been made, then I would suggest that you put aside some time, perhaps if you get the flu, or find yourself snowed in, or just an afternoon free, pop yourself some corn, nestle in a warm blanket, and watch all six hours of the documentary film footage.  Being a film buff, I have already done this and found it to be one of the most enjoyable and inspiring experiences of my life.  I could imagine, however, that some may be daunted by the idea of spending half a day sitting down doing anything, let alone watching documentary film footage about anything.

If this is the case, then you can always watch each thirty to fifty minute portion separately over several days, which, while less awe inspiring, might also be less intimidating.

Some of the things covered in the documenary include; how they adapted the book and why they left things out or added things, storyboarding, art direction, casting, music and sound effects, digital grading, props, and CGI, just to name a few.  Even if you have just a passing interest in the Lord of the Rings, but love learning how movies are made, or are just creative and are inspired by mammouth achievements, give it a gander, and you won't be dissappointed.  In the Two Towers, my absolute favorite part was them showing how Gollum was created.  This section is split up into three parts, which take about an hour and a half to watch.

It's easy to say, ""Go and watch it,"" but in all likelyhood, your local video store doesn't have the extended version DVD of all three of the LOTR movies, if they have any.  If you're like me, and you have several friends who are into it, you might be able to borrow it from them, but then you might not have a DVD player, in which case I am sorry for you (actually, I had to watch it at my dad's, as my DVD player is broken).  I saw it first by borrowing the first two box sets from my friend, who was borrowing them from her brother, and spent twelve happy hours over several days watching every single feature about how everything in the movie was done.  Then my friend's brother wanted them back (my friend never did get to watch the documentary), so I had to buy them myself.  It was well worth it.",1101945600,6,3581,4.531055900621118
1454760,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (LOTR) is the second film in a trilogy bringing the cult favorite Tolkien series of novels to the big screen. This was a massive undertaking considering the sheer scope of the fictional world and the number and variety of creatures created in the novels. All three films were shot all at once and are being released over the course of three years. The first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released in 2001 and grossed over $300 million at the US box-office and untold millions more worldwide and home release. The production budget was $100 million and change, and was filmed entirely on location in New Zealand. It won four Oscars (mostly technical: cinematography, makeup, visual effects, original score) and was nominated for nine more. It was an unarguable success which has made the release of the second film all the more highly anticipated.

Towers picks up right where Fellowship left off, and I'll assume you've seen Fellowship, or else this won't make much sense. The plot is fairly straightforward: the Hobbit protagonist Frodo is tasked with returning the magical and evil ring of power to the lava filled mountain from whence it came in order to destroy it and stop the world of Middle Earth from being overrun by some really nasty looking orcs and other bad guys. However, unlike in Fellowship, this has almost become a secondary plot line. The main action in Towers instead focuses on the human Aragorn and the buildup and eventual finale scene that is the massive battle at Helmsdeep where the good guys are badly outnumbered by the evil Uruk-Hai warriors. A third minor plot line involves two other hobbits and their attempt to rejoin their friends after being captured. Though minor, this side story really adds to the film with its humor and action.

Let me preface this by saying I consider a film to be a separate and distinct work of art even if it is based entirely on some other work, such as a novel. The film must stand on its own and must not be compared to the novel as this is an entirely different medium. It is impossible for a film to incorporate all the details and intricacies presented in a novel (much less three novels) and Tolkien geeks out there who criticize the films for omitting the many excruciating details of the three novels are just plain wrong, and also need to get a life. At most, I would expect the film to attempt to maintain the essence of the novel and not contradict the novel in any significant way.

I really enjoyed Tower and realized that this is exactly the kind of movie I have been missing for a long time. LOTR skillfully creates its own world and its characters operate in it faithful to its own rules. Towers is a brilliantly made epic action adventure film that effectively creates tension in its buildup and dramatic and exciting action sequences in the eventual payoff. Special effects abound but are used well and never strain the audience's imagination in accepting them as reality.

The two captured Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, spend most of the film either in shackles when captured, or scampering away while escaping or running from their captors. Their story gets much more interesting when they seek shelter in the forest and discover Treebeard, a walking and talking tree. He is a member of the oldest race in Middle Earth, and he and his comrades serve as a sort of forest ranger service in the woods. The trees move, talk, and think very slowly and carefully as you might expect a tree to. They are generally uninterested in the affairs of the world outside the forest, but the Hobbits give them a reason to care and join their battle.

Frodo and Sam continue on their own to try and return the ring to the mountain and destroy it but get sidetracked when they are joined by Gollum, the creature that previously owned the ring. Gollum is entirely computer generated, but is fully realized and a real addition to the film. Unlike say Jar Jar from Star Wars, Gollum is an interesting character that does not annoy the audience. His origins are mysterious, and as I understand are not even explored in the novels. He has a split personality, one half evil that still desires the ring, the other half good and desiring to aid Frodo in his quest. This split personality manifests in some of the most humorous scenes in the film. Gollum desires the ring like a drug, he cannot resist it. You can't help but pity the creature. He battles himself constantly, fighting his evil side to aid the Hobbits.

Gandalf returns after taking a nasty spill in the labyrinth battle in the first film. It turns out he went on to defeat the nasty Balrog fire monster and was rewarded by being transformed into a more powerful wizard, Gandalf the White. If my memory is right, wizards must complete significant and difficult tasks in order to advance in their level of power and skill. I also recall that white wizards are the highest order and most powerful of all wizards. This is definitely a good thing for our side. I felt a little disappointed though - I wanted to see Gandalf whip out some wicked, earth shattering spells on the bad guys, but he never really does. In the final battle sequence, he really just conks a few orcs over the head with his staff - where's the fun in that?

The buildup to the battle at Helmsdeep is unusually effective. Jackson does not rush the film and allows every scene to take its time. He wants the audience to feel the palpable tension that precedes a battle such as this, and I felt he succeeded. He truly makes this scene feel as big as its supposed to be. The battle scenes are very heavy on the computer graphics but never had that ridiculously fake looking quality of say, the clone battle in Star Wars 2. One big help is an advanced programming technique that gives every one of the thousands of individual warriors in the big battle scenes a mind of its own. This gives the artificial characters a more realistic look since they all do their own thing while having the same goal in mind, much the way real people would. This is not a new technique; I remember it being used in the penguin scenes of Batman Returns.

Jackson recognizes the need for comic relief in such a dark and serious film. The Hobbits provide much of this. The remainder comes mainly from the dwarf Gimli. I've already read some criticism saying his many one liners are out of place. I disagree and say they are a welcome break in a film that is quite bleak at times. Plus they are completely in keeping with the personality of the character. Gimli is a dwarf, and they are rambunctious creatures. The love to fight, but at the same time believe in eating, drinking, and being merry when they are not at war.

I have little to complain about in this film. As I said I'd like to see a little more magic play from the wizard characters. I did feel some of the action stretched the audience's reasonably suspended sense of reality in a few scenes when only one or two characters would defeat dozens and dozens of bad guys in head on contact.

I can't imagine anyone disliking this film. It scored an almost perfect 97% on the Tomatometer. It has already made a ton of money and I suspect will surpass the first film due largely to its greater action orientation. By now, the initial hype has simmered down and you should probably be able to get in to the show without worrying about a sellout.",1101859200,6,7405,4.577677224736048

1454763,5,B00005JKZU,"First things first, I never read any of Tolkien's novels yet, but a movie can not put every single page on screen. The movie would then become a tedious watch. Fans of the book might also complain. Hey, ""Jurassic Park"" didn't follow the book exactly. But overall, there hasn't been a movie that transferred every single page to the big screen. So don't complain too much.

Anywho, ""The Two Towers"" was probably the first Lord of the Rings movie I was really psyched to watch. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a movie I hadn't intended on watching, but since a friend said it's a ""kickass movie,"" I watched it and was very surprised, despite its abrupt ending. It only made me wish ""The Two Towers"" would be better. And surely enough, it was.

The movie's main ""attraction"" was the better character development. We begin to find out how each character personality is (although there's not much Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett scenes). And the group now being separated made that all possible. The action sequences are just amazing. The battle at Helm's Deep has such astonoshing visuals, making it the highlight of this movie. And Howard Shore's musical score... absolutely brilliant and beautiful music.

After viewing the movie, it right away became one of my favorite movies. Sadly, since I knew an extended version would soon be released after the theatrical cut, I wouldn't be able to watch it again for nearly a year later. But I must say, the wait was well worth it. More scenes that add to what I've described (and much more) and the extra features give me an insight of Tolkien's novels and how the movie came to what it has become.

""The Two Towers"" also had something the other two movies seemed to lack: a decent ending. *awaits for the bashers to reply* But there was something about this movie that made me like it more than the other two. I still can't figure out what it is exactly... it's just... some feeling that I get when watching this movie. It's a feeling that makes me think I'm watching it in theaters once again. Soon, I will know why I like this movie more than the other two... until then, I'll watch all three movies and figure out why...",1101081600,2,2163,4.595854922279793
1454764,5,B00005JKZU,"Some recent great personal reviews now that we've had some time since the theatrical release and ROTK. It seems the lasting legacy is more readily apparent now that we have more mature reviews than the early kids' reactions and negative reviews which had more to do with prized Star Wars prequel and Matrix legacies defeated as LOTR emerges as the true film classics of the 21st century alongside great films of the last century such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Ben-Hur"", and ""Gone with the Wind"" not to mention the original ""Star Wars"" before it was transmorgified into ""Episode IV: ANH"" in 1979, special edition 1997, and Hayden Christensen prequel edition 2004. Let me add to these insightful reviews my humble thoughts about TTT. Of course TTT theatrical or widescreen is the weakest of the trilogy. Jackson, Walsh and particulary Bowens tried to ""fix"" the most boring middle part of the book trilogy by catering to modern Hollywood conventions and possibly NL studio pressures to make the sequel as profitable if not more than the first film. Those changes apart from the original story did not make the movie fail but it spelled out TTT as most inconsistent and superfluous of the trilogy. However, TTT succeeds in great part to the outstanding production in most all aspects which supported all threee films and boasts some of the best action battle scenes(however unreleastic and making Aragorn look too Errol Fylnn with a clumsy attempt at a fix by the ""cliffdropping"" scene which is mostly due to Boyens' revisionist plotting attempts imo) , dramatic character acting scenes, and grandiose visual scenes in our new century of film. Jackson is the new Cecille B. DeMille of our time.",1100908800,,1690,4.954225352112676
1454765,5,B00005JKZU,"I have to agree with what one of the other reviewers said. The second movie is a vast improvement from the first and that is only because the first was severely constrained by having to introduce all the characters and lay down an infrastructure for the other two movies to follow. But that is no lying that the second one is great! There are some amazing special effects scenes and the characters are well developed and familiar by now. You also see the introduction of that scorned but piteous creature-Gollum. Also the female characters are better fleshed out- Arwen and Eowyn.

Like I said in my review for the Fellowship of the Ring,if you love the movie and are planning to buy it, you might as well go ahead and buy the extended edition. It is only a little more expensive than the theatrical version but far richer and more satisfying! You won't regret it.",1100304000,3,864,4.574193548387097

The stars did an amazing job and were true to their characters. Although this movie is three hours long, it went by very quickly. And like the first one, this one ends with more story left to be told. Without a doubt this sequel is just as good if not better than the first. Absoulutely beautiful scenery and the introduction of a few new characters makes for interesting twists and turns.

1454857,5,B00005JKZU,"I have to say that I was disappointed in the theatrical release.  I was floored by the visuals when I saw it in the theater, but once I watched it at home, the flaws in the storytelling were really glaring.  The whole movie felt choppy and disjointed.  The extended version, however, is an infinitely better movie.  I must admit that some of the extra Treebeard scenes are a bit much (although they're *supposed* to be boring), however, on the whole, the flow is MUCH better, and everything just *makes sense* in this version.  I was initially *very* upset by the changes made to Faramir's character, but with the backstory in the extended version, it is *much* more believable and acceptable.  I was also quite put out by the whole Aragorn-going-over-a-cliff thing until I heard the explanation for it in the documentary.  But again, something about the extra scenes made just made it make more sense, I don't know why.  And the Arwen scenes didn't seem so out of place, either.

So, while it is flawed, I still have to give it five stars just by virtue of it being such a VAST improvement over the theatrical version.",1098748800,,1119,4.6395939086294415
1454858,4,B00005JKZU,"First, I would like to say the Lord of the Rings trilogy (whether in book form or in film) is not for those suffering from attention deficit disorder.  It is not for those seeking a thrill a minute, who get bored to tears unless they see something blow up or a limb getting sliced off with blood spattering the camera lens every 5 seconds.  It is not for those who get lost whenever a plot has several intertwined storylines.  It is not for those who want climax or resolution where none is appropriate according to the flow of the story.

Neither is the Lord of the Rings epic for those who want to see reality-based movies (regardless, perhaps, of how liberally the reality is distorted), 'futuristic' thrillers, pointless comedies, or movies that are more akin to a thrill ride on a rollercoaster than to reading a good novel (though of course, the Lord of the Rings movies do offer their share of thrills and chills.)

If you are not the type who gets engrossed in a good story to the point of forgetting where you are or how late in the night it is, you probably wouldn't appreciate the Tolkien books or the Jackson movies.  If you never just stopped to gaze in silence for a few minutes at a particularly awesome sunset, or felt elation at listening to a particularly masterful musical performance, then you probably will not appreciate the vibrant, intricate and multifaceted beauty of either the Middle Earth books or the movies.  If you have never shed a tear in a movie theater, then you probably don't have the capacity for a visceral, emotional appreciation of this epic that makes it so worth-while for the fans.

I think the above does an ample job of explaining the bulk of negative reviews you will find here.

That said, the Two Towers in its theatrical release does have flaws.  Most if not all are mentioned and elaborated in other reviews, so I shall not repeat them here.  I would have given the theatrical release 3 stars -- not because I think it's mediocre compared to most other movies, but because I think it could have been that much better.

The Extended Edition adds some vital, crucial scenes.  The Faramir storyline is really fleshed out; the effect is dramatic enough in my opinion to elevate Faramir from a cardboard cutout to a flesh-and-blood being.  The extra scenes with Merry and Pippin in the forest are great; they really show the beauty of that ancient forest that was somehow not noticeable in the theatrical release, but they also help fill out the relationship between the hobbits and Treebeard (the extra scene at Orthank completes this set of enhancements, and I think really adds to the overall story.)  The Aragorn character is better developed, as is his relationship with Eowyn, and we find out that he is not actually an ordinary human (a very important point in the books, yet completely missing from the theatrical edition.)  The scenes with Huorns are a welcome addition.  The extra scene at the start of the movie where Sam gets to use the magical elvish rope gifted to him by Galadriel in the first movie's Extended Edition, is a welcome touch and helps explain why the rope causes such agony to Gollum later in the movie (i.e. it's not an ordinary rope.)  We get to see Gollum badly beaten when captured by Faramir's men, which helps us better understand his turnaround and anger at Frodo, and explains the scars on his back that we can see at the end of the movie in the theatrical edition.

I definitely think the Extended Edition is the movie to have and watch; forget the theatrical release as just a business tactic and a marketing ploy.

However, I stop short of giving the movie 5 stars.  This is due mostly to the battle at Helm's Deep.  Like many people, I was turned off by the corny jokes, flashy moves, and almost frivolous chivalry.  The battle, though gripping it certainly was and visually very impressive, was just not gritty enough.  It did not impress upon me the grave mortal danger in which Aragorn and company were mired.  It lacked the immediate terror, blood, and chaos of a real battle, as was so masterfully captured in some other films (for example, Saving Private Ryan.)  As well, some parts of the battle just were not believable.  Both Gimli and Aragorn literally lept on the spears of waiting Uruk-hai on two separate occasions and survived.  In Aragorn's case, he somehow ends up back in the fort to help shore up the breached gate right after he leaps off the ramparts into a swarm of Orcs, in grief at the death of Haldir.  Such things may pass you by on first viewing, but become noticeable when you see the movie for the second or third time.

I do not mind so much the departures from the books, according to which for example the encounter with Shelob should have been in the second movie.  However, even the extended movie did not leave me as ""wowed"" and awed as the first in the trilogy, it is not PERFECT enough for me to give it 5 stars.",1097625600,,4935,4.580204778156997

1454860,5,B00005JKZU,"I don't know what else I could say about this incredible film. Many see it as the clumsy part of the trilogy, not very understandable until the whole series is seen. But for what is considered the middle third of the longest Hollywood movie ever made, its certainly a sight to behold.

I still cannot get over the artistry of the computer effects. Not only are they ultra-realistic, they aren't used gratuitously.

And after seeing such low-quality CGI like Spiderman and Hulk, it seems all the more amazing. As Peter Travers put it, the battle of Helm's Deep will go down in history as one of the most sophisticated action sequences in cinema.

As far as the DVD goes, the added scenes made this part of the trilogy, a great singular film.  I always thought the characters of Eowyn and Boromir were pretty stale in the theatrical version, but with this edition, Boromir has become one of the more intresting characters in the story. Finally, too much can't be said about the amount of info put into these little discs from the commentaries to the documentaries. Who had any idea that the ARMOR had this much detail.

The way Peter Jackson has the sun in the backround when Aragorn,Legolas, and Gimli (Yes I memorized all of their names) run towards it. And the acting, my god, when you talk about dramatic actors, you think of plain old dramas, not fantasy epics. Believe me this film can get dramatic, but is this film is as dramatic as the first one, well no.

The first one is way better. The drama, the beginning of it all, the sadness, and there's something about the fight scenes that seem real in some way. The ""Fellowship"" focuses on the acting, not action, ""The Two Towers"" has useless, mindless action for the audience. Instead of focusing on the Hobbits and what these characters have to go threw to believe that they can destroy evil. What we get is a 45 minute action scene and Gandolf riding down a hill to save his friend.

 I think it's a fair guess that you have already seen if not bought the original. And I shall cut to the chase and say that if you liked the first movie you'll like this and the extras. If you didn't like the original it seems fairly pointless you buying this.

1454943,1,B00005JKZU,"Three books and three movies.  It fits.  But boy can I tell you this middle movie is boring.  Outright a waste of nearly three hours.  Why?  The plot goes nowhere where a simple addition onto the ending of The Fellowship Of The Ring or onto the intro of The Return Of The King couldn't take the audience.

Where does it go?  Well, Gollum is introduced, and Frodo and Sam, separated from the rest of the Fellowship, go hardly nowhere on their quest to destroy The Ring.  It seems to me that their capture by men on the few steps they take in this movie is a useless plot twist.  It doesn't change the story, there's no effect, and no cause.  No, we get to hear that the story will be worth telling by others to their children.  Boring, get on with the story.

As for Aargon's campaign, and the battle at Helm's Deep, this is also useless, pointless, and has no effect on the story.  This isn't the battle for all of mankind like it is stated, ""the battle to destroy the world of men.""  Even if Soloman's men did kill Aaragon and his men, the men of Middle Earth would still be in existance, as they battle the forces from the Mountain Of Fire in the next movie.

Also, Gollum's true hostile, menevolent character is not present, just ""yes master"" this and ""yes master"" that.  No where to be seen is the audience to fear him, to possess the ring, and end Frodo's campaign.  The introduction of Treebeard is the only selling point of this three hours but it nowhere comes close to making the movie anything but boring and pointless.

And another thing, why doesn't this rich director and the rest of the producers of the trilogy quit trying to score additional cheap shots at the general public and release the extended edition of the movies initially.  If he cared so much about maintaining the integrety of the literature that he is reproducing on film, why is he trying to profit twice on it?

At the conclusion of this movie, I have found that it left me with the feeling that something is missing, and also with the question of why I found both the first movie and the last of this trilogy so interesting, and found this so boring and void.  I have concluded the reason is that this movie is a pointless installation in moving along the story, reguardless of how the literature behind the movies set it up.

Overall this ends up to be boring, the plots twists are for nothing in the way of the story being advanced, the plot and story go nowhere, and this ends up being an uncomfortable waste of three hours of my life.",1092009600,4,2521,4.387931034482759
1454944,5,B00005JKZU,"This film was definatly the weakest of the trilogy, but it is still one of my personal fovorites. This film lacked the sophistication of The Fellowship of the Ring (which I believe is one of the most perfectly filmed motion pictures of all time) and was not nearly as entertaining and exciting as The Return of the King. First of all, nothing really happened in The Two Towers to advance the storyline. The movie can be summarized with two phrases...Gandalf returns, Saurumon is defeated...that's it. The ring does not get any closer to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili never catch up to the hobbits, Men have not untied against a common enemy, and the ending does not present the future challenges of the first film (i.e. the good guys win in the end). Secondly, the second half of the film is all about playing up the battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengard. In the book, the battle of Isengard and Helm's Deep do not seem that important. The battle of Isengard is barely even mentioned and the battle of Helm's Deep is half of a chapter (the battle of Minas Tirith is the real ""great battle""). Finally, I must say that the ending to this film was absolutely terrible! If Peter Jackson would have ended the film were the book ends (Gandalf and Pippin riding off to Gondor), the conclusion of this film would have been much better. The film ends foreshadowing the victory over the forces of evil with the major victory of Helm's Deep. The film does not end with a major cliffhanger like a good second film should (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example); the film ends with a ""key victory"" rather than a setback. With all of this said, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is still a superb example of fine filmmaking. This picture is a must have for any fantasy lover.",1091750400,,1800,4.524539877300613

 It is about the resilience of human spirit. It is about us and our desire to survive against all odds. It is about our iron will and our capability to unite and fight against common enemy who threatens our kind.
 This is why Lord of the Rings has struck a chord with all those who dare to plunge into its dark depths and evil plots.
 If Tolkein's book was grand with graphic details about massive orc armies threatning the middle earth, Peter Jackson's movie is well, ""grander"".
 Director Peter Jackson brings to life what all of us could only imagine. True, some things are not exactly as they are in the book, but the changes are apt and in many cases necessary. For example, do you really want to hear all the songs Merry and Pippin sing in the books? I was relieved I didn't have to.
 The movie begins with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas chasing orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin. It then progresses through Froddo's journey, his capture and later release by riders of Gondor, Aragorn's encounter with Gandalf the White, battle for Helm's Deep and Ent's battle with Saruman's armies. Of this the battle for Helm's deep stands out as the most detailed and accurate depiction of the scenes from the book. Huge Orc armies, fear and uncertainity in men, courage of Theoden King, last minute support from Elves are all recreated with all details. The only deviation from the book is that this movie ends before Gollum betrays Froddo to Shelob.
 Apart from that each and every detail of the book, from elf world to Helm's Deep has been beautifully recreated. Aragorn and Arwen's fairy tale love, Gimli and Legolas' friendly, almost playfull rivalry and Froddo and Samwise Gamgee's deep bond of friendship bursts forth in a thousand colors and leaves you wondering how the director managed to do it all in such vivid details while maintaining the flow of the book and coherency of the plot.

Speaking of computers, the little mostly naked guy with the nervous tick who guides the hobbits on their adventure had an achingly real oppressive acting style. The real actors here can at least be assured there is no threat to their profession. The hobbits themselves seemed much less like ""Snow White"" rejects and more genuine was the bond between them. The main swashbuckler dude seemed cautious of the camera while the long haired blonde Scandanavian guy was much more assured and seemed to be a real hero from Middle Earth. Loved the basic electricity look of the 'two towers', and one wonders how our own real satelite atmosphere compares.

1454952,4,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a worthy sequel to the outstanding The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is much darker than its predecessor in both mood and in the very coloration of the film itself.  The initial scenes as the audience falls through the inky blackness of the mines of Moria, following the epic duel between Gandalf and the inferno that is the Balrog, sets the tone for the rest of the film.

The Fellowship of the first film has splintered into three groups - Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and are now being tracked by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  Frodo and Sam are slowly edging nearer to the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor where they can destroy the terrible burden that is the ring.  In their quest they are aided by the wonderfully dichotomous character that is Gollum/Smeagol.  And The Two Towers really is Gollum's film.  He is a triumph of digital wizardry that the audience will both loathe and wish redemption for.

The other major computer-generated characters - Treebeard and his ilk - are perhaps not so successfully believable; although few viewers could fail to be moved by the ""last march of the Ents"".  The settings are simply stunning; both the natural scenery of windswept plains and craggy mountains, and the built sets, such as the Kingdom of Rohan that echoes the Viking settlements of old.

At the conclusion of the Battle of Helm's Deep, where (despite being a supposedly purpose-bred fighting force) the Uruk-hai are massacred by a handful of men, Gandalf prophesies that ""the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin"".  The audience is left to ponder what further horrors, heartbreaks and triumphs are in store for the adventurers.",1090627200,,1696,4.773972602739726
1455062,5,B00005JKZU,"Well, if it isn't THE best, it is one of the best DVD sets for a film.

To begin with, this is the 2nd installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and like before, Peter Jackson delivers a winner.  Capturing the amazing spirit of Tolkien's work, Jackson brings Middle Earth alive.  The basic plot, involves Sam and Frodo taking the ring closer and closer to Mordor, while the rest of the Fellowship attempts to regroup and face the growing threat of Saruman in Rohan.  The film has incredible performances from its all-star cast once again.  In addition, the special effects and filming locations bring an amazing new look to Middle Earth and really put the viewer in the story.

Now, for the DVD...This Extended Edition DVD set is absolutely incredible.  With more featurettes and an extended version of the film with deleted scenes reinsterted into the film, this is a moviegoers must have.

Buy the extended version and enjoy hours and hours of more content on one of the best adventures ever.",1090627200,2,998,4.728323699421965

1455064,4,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is without doubt the best of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. The second of the three, it features better acting and character development than the first or the third, and moves smoothly from one event or location to the next without confusing the viewer. It's a nice vehicle for Viggo Mortensen as the reluctant heir to the kingdom of Gondor, and features an entertaining, hammy performance by Brad Dourif as the sinister Grima Wormtongue. Ian McKellan is a wonderful Gandalf, Christopher Lee is perfect as Saruman, and most of the supporting players are quite good, although we get a little tired of Elijah Wood's mournful puppydog act as the ringbearing Frodo. ""Towers"" contains the best battle scene of the three movies: the battle at Helm's Deep (the third installment, ""Return of the King,"" has so many CG battle scenes that they become repetitive and boring), and the best scenes of interaction among the various inhabitants of Middle Earth. Cinematography is splendid, as are costumes and the architectural details that distinguish, for example, the court of Theoden at Edoras, in Rohan. Disappointing elements include Peter Jackson's alteration of the character of Faramir, and the scenes in which Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath are jarring; the Faramir of Tokien's novel is a much more interesting, likable person. In spite of these problems, the film as a whole is extremely impressive, and deserves to be ranked as one of the best fantasy/adventure movies ever made.",1090454400,,1503,5.064516129032258

The Two Towers, however, is the exception to the rule.  For lack of a better phrase, it rocks!!!  The extra material included in this extended version DVD really fleshes out the movie.  After you watch it you'll wonder why Peter Jackson left it out; it makes the movie complete.  The fight scenes at Helm's Deep are great, and you forget that a lot of what you're seeing is computer generated.  Several new characters are introduced, but you feel like you've known them all along.  The best part of the movie is the addition of a Boromir/Faramir scene.  Of course, I could be biased.

Additional scenes, more great and interesting bonus material, along with a great film, add up to a worthy purchase for fans. You definitely get your money's worth. Sure it is long, but its Lord of the Rings and Jackson's epic vision make you want to leap into the film and stay as long as you can.
As for the film itself, it is not as good as the first -- this one is the least like the book and that can be bothersome to many of the purists out there, especially concerning Faramir; also, there are some definite slow parts, such as the Aragorn / Arwen dream sequence and the Galadriel / Elrond sequence. The pace slows and almost gets tedious. But Helm's Deep saves it all with the most amazing battle sequence ever filmed.

1455070,4,B00005JKZU,"In this second installment, it's clear that Peter Jackson has tilted his favor decisively against the hobbits and in favor of conventional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star of the show is clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), while the hobbits (two sets of each) spend much of the movie away from the action.
Would a shift like this damage the movie? The answer to this is no. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is one of the best yet franetic swashbucklers ever made. And given the current audience tastes in violence, it's more popular than the first installment ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". It may not be faithful to Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimses of the books, but it really can stand on it's two legs.
The second in Tolkien's adaption is that it is a rousing adventure, skillful images of breathtaking beauty, and the marriage of special effects and computer animation.
With ""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" already out on DVD. I really didn't have much to say about the third because it resembles this second one, except it's less dark.

1455071,3,B00005JKZU,"I have seen all three films in theatre and own the Fellowship on the 4 DVD special edition... To make a film on this scale is an achievment .. more than 7 years spent and the results show.. unfortunately i disagree with those who call it a masterpiece.. It is boring.. plain and simple.. as an aspiring screenwriter i find that any film which relies so much on CGI and believes filmgoers come solely to see fantasy/action sequences and not hear a story is taking us for granted.. the book has a superb sructure. will not discuss it here.. but it slowly builds up and takes you on the journey with the characters.. every character from Aragorn to merry and pippin are shaped so well by Tolkien.. The film fails becasue it does not have a structure which involves the audience.. We are just taken through a series of action pieces in the first film.. the second film does better but not much while the third film-climax is more absorbing but because of the first two stinkers a first timer loses the plot.. On my own part I loved the Arwyn-Aragorn story, the scene where she sees him and thier child is possibly my favourite moment in the film.. pure cinema.. wordless and says everything.. A few personal notes of why you may want to pick up the DVD.. the making of the film is nothing short of amazing.. the DVDS 3 and 4 are chock pakced with info about the pre-prod, prod and post and are must have for thier extensive detailing about the prokject.. well worth the money to anyone who wants to find about the hardwork and effort that goes into making a film.. Should the lord of the Rings have been written by a professional screenwriter who understands the craft and structure of an epic.. which is what the LOTR is.. YES.. I think Peter Jackson is a brilliant filmmaker and his hardwork shows but him and Franz Walsh shine through in only certain moments when they don't let the CGI steal the human element from the film.. Having said that pick up the DVD, at that price it's a steal whether you're a lord of the rings afficiando or just a lover of films... On my own part I would have loved the LOTR as a series of six films with each book being divided into 2 parts and each part at 3 hours.. it would have been a more fulfilling experience.. but then that's what i think...",1089158400,,2279,4.390070921985815

From THE DIGITAL BITS: ""In other DVD release news, Entertainment Weekly magazine posted a short blurb in their June 19th issue about what we can expect on the forthcoming The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Special Extended DVD Edition (which arrives in December - street date TBA). Look for the film to be a whopping 49 minute longer, complete with more than 300 new FX shots completed just for this release. Among the new scenes you'll see will be Gandalf facing down the Witch King at Minas Tirith, the Mouth of Sauron taunting Aragorn and company at the Black Gates, Aragorn tending to Eowyn at the House of Healing, and Gandalf's final confrontation with the wizard Saruman. You'll also get more audio commentaries from everyone involved, two discs worth of exclusive, in-depth documentaries and (we've heard) a pretty funny Easter egg or two.

1455192,2,B00005JKZU,"A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist. So, after reading this review, please do not call me a cynic.
First of all, one needs to be sympathetic with the film-maker. 'The Two Towers' is the second part of the trilogy- stuck in the middle- neither here nor there. Hence, a lot needed to be done to make the film gripping. However, the only highlight is the battle at Helm's Deep, which, at best, can be called good. Gandalf's return as the White Wizard was fun to watch. However, trying to enjoy the rest of the film is in itself a battle- a losing one. A long, dreary 3-hour torcher is what this film boils down to. Pardon me for being harsh, but I cannot help compare it to its predecessor, which was nothing short of a masterpiece! 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' was a complete film- complete in the sense that it left one satisfied. It had the calm, serene and beautiful Shire on one hand and the dark and dreadful Mines of Moria on the other. Several scenes in it left one gaping. Nothing of the sort is found in this film.
Having said that, one has to realise that the book(the original story) itself might not have permitted extravagance.
So, if you want to enjoy a good film with astounding effects, do not go in for this film. However, if you want to complete the trilogy, then do, by all means, watch 'The Two Towers'. Don't let the link go missing. But, please, do NOT even dream of comparing it to either its presecessor or its successor- which are in a league of their own.",1088726400,,1487,4.333333333333333

1455198,4,B00005JKZU,"It's interesting to see how many people say things like: ""Get the extended version because it has more scenes in it"" or ""Get the extended version because it has more 'extras' in it"".  Well sometimes 'longer is better' and sometimes not...
In the case of ""The Two Towers"" I would agree that the `extended' version was easily superior to its theatrical counterpart.  The extended version filled in many important plot elements and fully rounded out the middle movie.  Most of the `dangling' plot elements were far better explained in this extended version.
However, I cannot say the same for the `extended' version of the first movie, i.e. ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""  The extended version of `The Fellowship....' added very little new to the plot development with the exception of the `Lady Galadriel's Gift Giving' scenes.  On the contrary, the extra footage of the Shire in the beginning weakened the much tighter and far better Shire opening in the theatrical version.  Plus with the various changes to the musical score, the `extended' version of `The Fellowship of the Ring' just drags on too much.  I cannot recommend the `extended' version of  ""Fellowship"" over the theatrical version.  All in all, my view on `Theatrical' versus `Extended' is summarized as follows:
The Fellowship of the Ring:
1) `The Fellowship of the Ring' Theatrical Version:  4 stars (out of 4), a very tight and well plotted opening for the Trilogy.
2) `The Fellowship of the Ring' Extended Version:  3 stars (out of 4), moves far slower at the wrong times, strong scenes from the theater version end up feeling weaker and watered down.  The musical score is weaker as well.
The Two Towers:
1) `The Two Towers' Theatrical Version:  3 stars (out of 4), rather disappointing due to too many unfinished scenes and the feeling that too many plot twists were left unexplained.
2) `The Two Towers'  Extended Version:  4 stars (out of 4), fully fixes all of the elements missing from the theatrical version.  This one should have been released as the theatrical version.
The Return of the King:
1) `The Return of the King' Theatrical Version: 4 stars (out of 4), Fully realized, beautiful ending to the trilogy, in spite of the lack of `The Scouring of the Shire'.  Hey, do you want to sit for another hour?
2) `The Return of the King' Extended Version:  Not yet released.  If it goes on too long, I'll have to build a bladder bag into the couch, but it's doable...Still, there are a few loose ends which it may well address, chiefly `The House of Healing', etc.  Once again though, even an extra half-hour is probably going to be too long, but we'll see...
Anyway, that's my take on `Extended' versus `Theatrical' so far.  It really depends on each and every movie.  Sometimes longer is better...sometimes not...",1086912000,,2787,4.8354430379746836

The movie itself is a stunning masterpiece but The extended edition of TTT virtually renders the theatrical edition almost irrevelent to me because the newly incorporated footage, all 43 minutes of it, virtually expands the entire scope of an already great epic and the new footage gives this movie a whole new look from my perspective. No offense to whose who like the theatrical edition, it's still amazing, but it's almost like cut up compared the the ""Extended Edition"". Many scenes which seemed unimportant are greatly expanded and there are also some new scenes which are completely left out of the theatrical DVD edition one of which was very heartbreaking but I'm not going to say what it is out of fear of spoiling it.
 The first two DVDs contain excellent commentary by Peter Jackson, by the design crew, and also by the stellar 16 member cast of this stunning masterpiece. Even then, there's also lots more of what's on them than just what I mentioned.
 The third and fourth DVDs however are the real treats! As for all of the many fans including myself out there who are baffled and awe-struck at how they could possibly have made such an incredible epic movie like this, well these third and fourth DVDs delve deep into the making of this movie. The documentaries contained are absolutely stunning and worth watching over and over again! The humongous scope of the massive work done with making all of the many things for this movie is phenomenal and beyond imagination! Would you believe all of the hard work that was put into making not just the movie but even the movie sets themselves. I have never before seen such a mind-blowing `behind the scenes' DVD like the ""Gift Set"" edition. Both the third and fourth discs are enough to warrant buying this awesome Gift Set. There are so many more treats on this gift Set that I could never do this DVD any justice with this review nor do I want to spoil it.
 This set also comes with a statue of Gollum which is actually quite cool and makes for good decorative use for my desktop and also a fifth DVD of artwork of Gollum and how the statue of him was made but it's not a whole lot to write home about in my opinion  but even if you just get the `regular' ""Extended Edition"" you have no idea of the many, MANY Easter Eggs that are found on this set. This set may be a bit on the expensive side but trust me, this item is worth more than the price tag slapped on it. Just the box packaging is worth keeping forever! The bottom line: I say get this DVD and throw out the VHS!!
 Okay, I'll stop here but before I go, I just want to say thank you to Peter Jackson and the entire crew for not only creating three stunning masterpieces but also putting out incredible DVD sets for ""The Two Towers""",1084320000,4,3045,4.449820788530466

1455413,5,B00005JKZU,"I loved the Battle of Helm's Deep. When Legolas and Gimli arrive at Helms Deep, they discover they are desperately short of manpower, and when Aragorn arrives and tells of the thousands coming to defeat them, all but these three are filled with despair. Then help comes, from an unexpected source. Now, with slightly more manpower, Helm's Deep awaits attack. The orcs come, and take their places. Aragorn gives the word, and the army releases their arrows.
So the battle begins. On the good side, many people, dwarfs, and elves are killed, and on the evil side, many orcs are killed. Men are shown falling off Helm's Deep's monstrous wall to the ferocious orcs below, while orcs are shown being cut apart by the swords of the warriors on the good side. In the end of the battle, when Helm's Deep's defending army finds itself outnumbered, Gandalf comes with another army, and the orcs are destroyed.
Another fascinating part of this movie is the battle between the talking trees and Saruman's army. A talking tree is taking Merry and Pippin back to the Shire. One of them suggests that they take a longer route to get there. While on this route, this tree sees the destruction that befell many of his kind. He howls in rage, and also to get the other talking trees to join him. Together, these trees throw enormous boulders at a dam holding water back from flooding the grounds where orcs were produced, and at the orcs themselves. While some of the trees are set on fire, the orcs succumb to the power of the trees.

1455414,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson pulled off the impossible -- he translated an over-written yet beloved epic into a riveting trilogy.  And yet even with dividing ""LOTR"" into three long films, Jackson was forced to make dramatic cuts in the story in order to make it fit.  Fans of the books will love this extended version of the film, as it fleshes out the story.  Extended scenes between the hobbits and the Ents, Faramir and Boromir, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn, and Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor are treats.
Did Jackson make some departures from Tolkein's novels?  Sure -- he had to, if for no other reason than Tolkein's dialogue is about as dull as can be imagined.  Still, Jackson has faithfully recreated Middle Earth and its stock of beloved characters.  The ensemble cast throws themselves into the roles with gusto, and the special effects are amazing.
The major surprise in this film is the emergence of Gollum (formerly Smeagol), the tortured Ring Bearer from whom Bilbo stole the Ring in ""The Hobbit.""  Using CGI, Jackson uses a boffo performance from Andy Serkis (even though Mr. Serkis is never seen because Jackson superimposed CGI over Serkis' form) to create the most fully realized computer-generated character ever.
The extra DVD discs show that this project was obviously a labor of love for those concerned, and their cinematic accomplishments are even more amazing when you see the process of how the film was made.  These DVD extras are worth it!",1083369600,,1470,4.923076923076923
1455415,5,B00005JKZU,"Dear Fans: The extra 48 minutes in this ""version"" are a step up in the trilogy.  It improves the whole movie, given the fact that in my opinion the theatrical version left out many details, or did not develop certain passages of the book to an appropiate level of detail, but how many minutes can you stand in a movie theatre?  That is not the case of a DVD that you can watch in the comfort of your own home.
The experience is greatly improved, specially for die hard fans such as myself.  I was rather disapointed in the theatres and  now I can't wait for the extended version of The Return of The King wich is rumored to have an extra hour and a half of footage.",1083024000,,665,4.171875
1455486,5,B00005JKZU,"Like the ""Fellowship of The Ring"", this gift set edition of ""The Two Towers"" completely trashes the theatrical edition of this movie right into the ocean because of it's greater scope.
 In this movie, the remainder of the fellowship have gone their separate ways due to unfortunate circumstances. Two of them were lost. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee have now gone on their way towards Mordor and the Ring has gotten more powerful and Frodo has found it harder to resist it's dangerous power. However they have encountered the dangly creature named Gollum who once carried the Ring for over 500 years and has now aims to take back the Ring but Frodo and Sam who doesn't trust Gollum, have to trust him and Gollum guides them towards Mt. Doom.
 Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have now gones towards Isengard to rescue Merry and Pippin but are now find themselves towards the kingdom of Rohan where it's king has been withered by Saruman's power using the palantir. Saruman's army of Uruk Hai has grown massive and now numbers thousands of Uruk Hai and have been unleashed on Rohan.
 This gift set edition of ""The Two Towers"" completely trashes the theatrical edition right out of the water and into the recycling bin because this edition has over 43 minutes of new footage that was not in the regular edition.
 The third and fourth discs are absolutely amazing and contain unbelievable amounts of making of, story behind and all the stunning sets and all the work that was done to create them!

This movie is at most mediocre as is The Fellowship. The acting is amazing and the music is beautiful, but everything else sucks.
The special effects are overwhelming and beat the simplistic storyline down into a bloody pulp. The biggest problem with these movies is the directing. It's tedious, and boring, scanning vast scenery slowly and mind numbingly; the beginning credits whoich lasted no more then three minutes felt like 20. And as for the movie's length at three hours, it felt like more like five, because of poor character developement.
The stupid dialogue is set as a volume so low a dog couldn't hear it, and the soundtrack is set so loud that someone could here it from one-hundred miles away. Whatever charm the books seemed to have have been erased with these movies. Personally, I find the whole concept stupid: a bunch of humans and mythical creatures trying to toss a supernatural ring into a volcano uncreatively called mount doom so that they can get rid of an all powerful autocrat and install their own all powerful autocrat. And what's more, the kid who risks his life and goes scytzophrenic to throw the stupid ring in mount doom doesn't even get to be king? I'd like to give each member of the Fellowship of the Ring an uzi, grenade launcher and MP5 and see what the dark forces of Sauron could do.
And back to the specifics to this movie. It and the Return of the King starts off with no backtracking and begins exatcly where the Fellowship left off, leaving people who aren't directly familiar with the storyline lost.
This movie is a Royal Bore. Don't waste your money.",1082246400,2,1624,4.701754385964913

1455490,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is the second of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. And I would recommend that you watch them in order. In this movie we follow the three seperate story lines of the now disbanded fellowship.
Frodo and Sam continue to follow their guide Gollum through the bleak landscape to Mordor. Merry and Pippin brave the forest of Fangorn Forest where they meet the memorable Ent, Treebeard. And of course you have Aragorn, Legolas and Gimly making a heroic stand at Helms Deep against thousands upon thousands of Uruk-hai.
Helms Deep is truly a battle of epic porportions. And you will want to chear as the Ents move to attack Isengard. The special effects throughout the whole movie are spectacular. The additional material included in this addition gives the character's greater depth. And goes far in showing the dynamics of the Steward of Gondors family relationships.
This movie has more action that the first one. And though very enjoyable and well directed, it does not flow as clean as the fiorst movie. Here we have to follow three seperate stroy lines. As you do in the book. This version is much better than the theatrical release and I highly recomend it's viewing.",1082073600,,1182,4.799019607843137
1455491,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is a very complicated story. Fitting it into three hours can make some scenes seem a little rushed to those who have read the book (such as myself). That is my only problem with the theatrical edition. I really don't care about any of the changes (except maybe Aragorn falling off the cliff) because I understand why the makers made the changes, unlike ""Tolkien Purists"" who have not a clue the challenge of transfering a huge book with such a complicated plot to a 3 hour movie. Anyway, to the point, it was around 30 minutes added to the Fellowship on the Extended Edition. But this year, we are in for a bigger treat as 43 minutes will be added on to The Two Towers in the Extended Version. This edition will make the movie so much better as it will feel less rushed.

1455615,5,B00005JKZU,"I'll say it right off the bat: ""The Two Towers"" is my least favorite of the three Lord of the Rings films. But it's only right behind ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""Return of the King."" So on a scale of 1 to 10, the first and third are both 10s, and this one is a 9. Still not a bad rating by any means! The Two Towers is an excellent film!
The creative forces behind this film gave it just as much effort as the other films. But the way the story is is what makes it not quite as good as the other ones. The first and third films really gave you a sense of wonder and enchantment. You traveled to places that seemed unworldly, but still felt like they could've existed at one point. I felt like I was uncovering a long lost past. With this film, it felt like Middle-Earth, but not nearly as much as the other films. It felt a little TOO much like real history - mostly because the story deals more with the race of men. We don't travel to many new locations that have that etherial feel to them, because we're mostly at ""man-made"" locations throughout the film. It all just felt medieval. It wasn't as ""fantasy-like"" as the other ones. But that's how the book was, so I don't fault the film-makers for that. They were pretty true to the book, and that's how it should be. It's just my least favorite part of the three part story. Don't get me wrong though, because I still think it's a great story, and I love it much more now that this extended edition is out.
What strengths this film has are what fantasy-like elements it DOES have - like the Ents, the Uruk-hai, more of Isengard and Rivendale, etc. And most of all - Gollum. And the battles are really cool.
This extended version does make ""The Two Towers"" better though. For me, it's better because it has more of the fantasy elements in it. More ents, more Gollum, more Isengard, more Fangorn Forest, etc. There really are a lot of new great scenes in this version, and it's a must have just for that reason alone.
However, there's more. This version is packed full of special features! Two discs worth. Everything is there to give you a second-hand look at just how much passion, effort, and love was put into this film. These special features really show how much the creative forces behind these films really care about The Lord of the Rings.
Great movie, amazing DVD!",1080691200,,2327,4.327231121281464
1455616,2,B00005JKZU,"WARNING - I've read and re-read Tolkien's works so what I write below is accurate.  What follows then is for those true fans who want to know what's what, not some simple ""it was great"" review.  It is obvious that previous readers of the original review below, that if someone doesn't like what you are saying, even if it is true, that you are not being ""helpful"".  Just a warning then, before reading on - if you liked the movies, by all means, go and buy it, but if you are a true fan of Tolkien, just like the title of this review indicates, you will agree with what I have written below after having seen the movie(s).

The Lord of the Rings trilogy consists of 3 very pretty movies, much like Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) was a pretty face.  Unfortunately, the Tolkien fan deserves more than this.  For the rest of the world, this was an acceptable popcorn chompfest with much more action to see the fan through to the end of this overblown epic.
  For the true fan of fantasy and Tolkien, Peter Jackson has done the unforgivable in creating this movie.  I realize that most books are far too complicated and deep for a mere 2 hour movie to portray in full, and I understand that some scenes can be edited for pacing or when they are deemed unnecessary to the flow of the movie.  I really do undersand it.  But Peter Jackson didn't do this; rather, he changed the very nature of the story in subtle and significant ways to suit the audience rather than remain faithful to the story.  This is fine for the average fan, but the true fantasy fans are left in the dust for yet another Hollywood-ified bastardization of a classic.
  This story is the heart and soul of the fantasy genre.  Sure, there have been fantasy books and stories long before The Lord of the Rings, but none before had reached the epic proportions of this classic, the cornerstone of fantasy.  Peter Jackson is a hack who, while he did an excellent job in logistics for handling this massive undertaking, his understanding of the actual story was shown to be weak, at best.
  There is not enough space here to show where he emasculated the story - read the novels (trust me, it gets better after the first 2/3 of the Fellowship!) or listen to the 9 disk audio set for the full story - but let me point just a few.  He glorified what was originally an afterthought of a love story around Aragorn for the mere purpose of selling tickets to women.  This is much like George Lucas changing the Wookie planet into the cute Ewoks so the girls would have something to enjoy.  This is no surprise.  He also changed the very important role of Saruman in the story, making him a simple pawn of Sauron, rather than an erstwhile foe who sought the ring to challenge Sauron so that he could dominate the world under his own feet instead.  What was up with the avalanches in the Fellowship?  It was the Wargs that chased them into Moria.  And while I mention Wargs, they are supposed to be DIRE WOLVES.  I have no idea what those creatures were he pawned off on us.  On a technical note, in the Return of the King, the battle scene was great Hollywood, but no tactician would have ever tried to defend a city like that (gates that open IN????), nor would cavalry go stupidly into the rush of a slower foe, knowing they had the speed to outflank.  Great Hollywood, foolish stupidity - these were supposed to be the BEST cavalry in the WORLD - they would surely know how to flank.  And Boromir?  Could they have possibly made him any more of sleazebag in the movie, rather than the hero who simply sought to do right by his people?  It's a shame that Peter Jackson did not apparently read the Lord of the Rings, for it shows.",1080604800,8,3679,4.39792899408284
1455617,5,B00005JKZU,"Almost 3/4 of an hour of extended scenes - some brief and subtle, others surprisingly important, was an absolute delight and brought Jackson's masterpiece even closer to Tolkien's. The commentary offers many great insights and is often genuinely amusing.  The bonus disk and book, devoted to the creation of Gollum, is utterly fascinating in its own right. The Gollum statuette is beautifully detailed, satisfyingly heavy and now has pride of place in a display cabinet in my lounge!
What else is there to say about the movie itself that hasn't already been stated?  Surely THE most spectacular battle scene ever filmed vies for your attention with the most stunning and convincing non-human creature ever to grace the big screen! Gollum is utterly believable and the alternating pity, tragedy and horror that Tolkien wished us to feel, is conjured forth with astonishing skill by Jackson.  Sumptious, sweeping landscapes and not a duff piece of acting in sight complete this marvellous movie experience.

A great adaptation of the second section of the book. It's also the only one of the three that strays a little bit story wise. I expereinced Middle-earth by seeing film one, read the book, and now seeing films 2 & 3. After reading the book and going into the cinema, the best things about this movie is seeing Gollum; Treebeard and the ents when they... you'll see; and one of the famous battles of the War of the Ring, Helm's deep.

1455620,1,B00005JKZU,"I am not a fan of the fantasy genre. So I was surprise to find myself so enthralled by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien's books have to be read if you want to appreciate how he used the language (vocabulary, syntax) to indicate the race, history, class, morality of each of his characters. Moreover it is the incredible depth of his details: every river and mountain contains vestiges of long-vanished inhabitants of which only partial histories remain, the Fellowship's path crosses many other paths that might have been taken, but were not because of the choices each character made, that gives LOR its powerful quality of having *actually* once happened, in a *real* landscape. The reader's imagination is truly given wings for flight.
  Finally it is only in the form of printed word that a character's inner dialogue with himself, his struggle with moral choices, his doubts can be fully developed, and that the reader has the time to savor and understand. (Be sure to look at ""J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century"" for more on this.)
  But the entire inner, moral, and finally spiritual dimension of Middle Earth is utterly squashed by Peter Jackson into sense-jarring, superhero maudlin action-flick. Let's not talk his making the Elf Race into xenophobic, mechanoid fascist army. Let's not talk about Jackson's close-up sadistic fascination with gore which completely inverts Tolkien's refusal to treat battle scenes in detail (as he was concerned about the moral dimensions of war and evil, and not to titillate the reader). Let's not talk about how Aragorn's character is reduced to an Oprah-Show-like figure striving to believe in himself.
Yes, the scenery is great. The views of the Mines of Moria are tremendous. The sight of Gandalf's horse troop, bent on saving Helm's Deep, galloping down a slope so absurdly steep as to make a live horse and rider tumble head-over-heels had me howling with laughter.
Be forewarned. If you only see this movie, you will not have any clue of why Tolkien has inspired generations of readers. If you have to do both, then read the books FIRST!",1079913600,11,2097,4.948863636363637

The first movie had a feeling of wonder and magic about it. This movie has a feeling of gore and death about it.

1455623,5,B00005JKZU,"although, in my opinion, ""The Two Towers"" is my third favourite in the triology, do not assume that it means is bad. far beyond the truth! indeed, ""The Two Towers"" is the essential ""Middle Film"" as they call it, literally the following scene from the end of the ""Fellowship"", and is a perfect way to get you trully urging for the ""Return"". In saying that I must warn anyone now: DO NOT SEE THIS WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THE FIRST and ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SEE THE THIRD WITHOUT SEEING THIS or i promise you, you will be totally, utterly confused. HEHE!
The fellowship is broken. now the story breaks again into three superbly moulded adventures, Merry and Pippin's entrapment in fangorn forest, aragorn and co prepare for the battle of helm's deep with repaired kingdom rohan, and of course, our dear frodo and sam continue their quest towards the never-sleeping mordor, accompanied by their guide Gollum to destroy the One Ring, which of course is tragically beginning to take power over frodo.
the battle of helm's deep is an absolutley wonderful scene. epic battles and superb stunts really give it a finishing kick. They really are fantastic! And the ancient Ent, Treebeard who befriends Merry and Pippin is a startling special effect. Of course the most impressive addition in this movie is the creature Gollum, totally moulded from a human actor (Andy Serkis) into a revolutionary computer animated delight!
This film probably was my thrid favourite, because there is alot of the story focussing on the men, which of course is perfectly fine as that is how it is like in the book. my favourite character is frodo, and i would have loved to see him included a bit more in the epic. But not to worry - because the closing scenes are magnificent and emotional (a snippet to whats in store for the third!) when frodo and sam, who have had their friendship tested on their journey, trully strengthen their bond. It's extremely moving!
This film is amazing! It's a perfect ""Middle Film"" for what has become the greatest triology ever brought to the big screen.

1455756,4,B00005JKZU,"The second installment of a trilogy is always the toughest to pull off. It inevitably lacks the freshness of Part I, and the climax of Part III, and so the best one can hope for is to move the story along, and hope we're all intrigued enough to want to carry on. Peter Jackson solves this dilemma by making the second installment of his LOTR trilogy a cut 'em up, slash 'em up, fast-paced shootout focusing on a series of epic battles. And he does quite well. The film's battle scenes are truly spectacular, both in scope and scale, and Jackson allows his cinematographer to flourish throughout the film, as the New Zealand landscapes dominate the screen. Rarely has such a violent film been so gorgeous to look at.
My biggest beefs with this series continue to be a fairly uninspired script that's rife with clichs thinly-masked in archaic lingo, and a dimwitted central character (Frodo) who's not compelling in the slightest. The Two Towers also would have done well not to feature so much of that annoying, incomprehensible, animated creature Gollum, who I found only slightly less contemptible than the dubious Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars infamy. But I quickly forgave this film's flaws and went along for the ride, caught up in the sheer energy of the film, and I found myself enthusiastically looking forward to Part III.

1455759,5,B00005JKZU,"The biggest problem Tolkien fans have for the film versions of these books, particularly The Two Towers, is that they compare them too closely with the books.  When being critical of a movie, whether based on a book or not, one must judge it in the context of film alone.  As such, this movie is terrific, genius not just on the part of Peter Jackson's story telling skills, put a work of collective genius by artists, writers, craftsmen, and actors.  Sadly the ending doesn't have the ""leave you hanging"" feeling to the same extent of the first one, but there's enough of one to make you want to come back.  The acting was just on target for the characters, Merry, Pippin, and Gimli are particularly enjoyable and add much appreciated comic relieve.  Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his Gollum and Faramir's character is wonderfully complexe (thanks to the added scenes that never should have been cut) and so much love went into creating Rohan it's impossible not prefer Edoras to Minas Tirith (in the 3rd film).  The three plot style is wonderfully handled, never once losing the audience, and skillfully switches from one to another just when one plot is starting to be exposed for too long.  The only scenes which trouble me are Aragorn's mystic revival (kind of sappy but the irritation doesn't last long) and the Hurons marching to Helms Deep; it is confusing as you don't see enough of them and Treebeard doesn't explain the situation enough.
  As for changes from the book, if one wants to explore that, I don't dissaprove of any of them, especially after the explanations in the extra features.  They do much to streamline a complicated plot that works great on a written page, but in a movie format would loose too many people.  The only change that irks me a little is Faramir, but after seeing Return of the King, and the flash backs (and his small lament over a fallen  enemy soldier that one might remember Sam thinking in the book)I feel they didn't change him so much as we just discover him more slowly-and maybe more realistically.

We pick up right where we left off...with the three warriors running after their friends and fellowship just as strong as when they first set out from Rivendell, the ties of friendship and loyalty and a dedication to good stronger than ties of blood regardless of the fact that the fellowship is strung out over the face of Middle Earth, seperated by time and evil and a pressing need for strengh.
I'm thankful that Sam and Frodo's trek to Mordor is presented in such a way as to find the sense of humor in even the darkest of situtations and while the situtation does grow increasingly dangerous and dark, Peter Jackson takes a break from the heaviness surrounding them and their mission and turns that attention toward Rohan and Helm's Deep.  He leaves Sam and Frodo to make their way through the sunny countryside heading toward the firey mountian of Doom and never too far out of mind is the fact that this quest to rid the world of evil could claim their lives.
The Battle of Helm's Deep still takes my breath, even away after repeated viewings.  Though they might very well be going to their deaths, the men of Rohan along with a Elven army on loan from Elrond and our three intrepid warriors of the Fellowship take a stand against the beginning of the evil...and the following scene is one that HAD to be made.  Watch it and try not to thank the actors, stunt men, directors and writers for bringing that to the big screen.  Just for the presentation of the will of survival in the name of good it's worth the viewing and the money it took to make it come alive.

1455877,5,B00005JKZU,"Rather than trying to argue with the people who don't like the movie (as everyone else seems to be doing), I figured I would actually review the DVD.
First of all, the movie is remarkably well done considering the pure scale of the books. To try and recreate Tolkein's world is an enormous task, and was incredibly well done by Peter Jackson. LOTR is incredibly simple in its plot, but its the way the characters who are not human become human to us and make us relate to them that makes LOTR interesting. Its a human interest story when it really comes down to it.
As for the extended edition DVD, I just have to say wow. There's a lot of information to take in. But when you spend 3 years filming a movie and then another 3 editing it, you might as well do it right. I'm a huge fan of documentaries of any kind, from the Civil War to the history of hot dogs, I find it fascinating. If you're not that type of person, the normal dvd will probably suit you just fine, but if you either are an absolubte fanatic about LOTR or just really enjoy behind the scenes of things in general, then its an incredibly well put together dvd.
The extra scenes that were added into the movie aren't especially neccesary if you're just a casual fan, since it makes the movie that much longer (about 50 minutes), but if you have the patience to sit through it and really enjoy the films, then the extra scenes are very nice to have. A lot of humorous scenes and character background scenes got cut out of the theatrical version, so it kinda makes the movie a little less gloomy.
So to sum up, wonderful film, surprisingly extraordinary cast, and extended scenes and the most comprehensive extra features a dvd release has ever seen make this a wonderful dvd for your collection and very much worth the extra $10 over the theatrical version.",1077667200,3,1823,4.41246290801187

1455880,5,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition Gift Pack is a fantastic DVD boxed set and a brilliant tribute to the genius of JRR Tolkien.
I will start by reviewing the film itself. While I thoroughly enjoyed The Two Towers theatrical edition, the extended edition is even better.
The story, while a slight departure from the books, is nothing short of genius. Integrating three distinct and complex story lines into one film is a fantastic achievement on the part of Peter Jackson and his writing team. It follows on directly from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, with each group of characters now having seperate but related adventures throughout Middle-Earth.
The film features some of the most talented actors of our age, people like Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee, to name just a few. One person worth special mention is Andy Serkis, who plays Gollum, and does a fantastic role with this complicated character.
The camera work in the films is also extraordinary, and features some truly magnificent photography of the NZ landscape, while keeping the film in line with what Tolkien wrote in his books.
But the real gold of the extended edition is just that, the extended scenes. These scenes help to reinforce and add more depth to the various scenes in the theatrical edition, expanding the story and, in some parts, paying tribute to parts of the books that were absent from the films.
For myself, the most enjoyable extended scene was a flashback that Faramir has of Boromir, to a time when Boromir led the forces of Gondor in retaking Osgiliath. To see the Boromir-Faramir-Denethor dynamic in play is something very special indeed. The scene also helps to explain why Boromir was seduced by the Ring in the first film.
The behind the scenes part of this DVD set (2 discs worth) are also well worth watching. The Lord of the Rings represents a pioneering effort in film-making, and to see how it was all done is fascinating. Some of the most interesting documentaries concerned the computer animation aspects of the film, and the way that computer programs were designed to simulate realistic  battles on a huge scale, with each participant responding like a real person would. These documentaries make for truly fascinating viewing.
In addition to the DVD, this set includes a statue of Gollum and an accompanying DVD and booklet. The statue is wonderful, beautifully carved and hand-painted, it really captures Gollum well. The DVD to me seemed to be little more than an advertisement for similar collectible statues, with some of the big name production personnel going into detals of their personal collections, and the company that made the LOTR statuettes going into details about how the statues were made. It seemed like little more than an advertisement to me.
To a more trivial point, the overall box itself is beautiful, featuring a lovely picture of Gandalf leading the Rohan cavalry charge at Helm's Deep. I normally don't keep product boxes, but this box was simply too good to throw away, just like the box for the FOTR DVD Gift pack.
If you are a Lord of the Rings fan of any description, then this boxed set would be a great purchase. If you can afford it, then I highly recommend you buy it.",1076889600,6,3247,4.818996415770609

1455971,5,B00005JKZU,"Most DVD's with ""bonus"" footage include cut scenes and various throwaways that the director had some fondness for.  This version, however (which I had the good fortune to see in the theater before the release of Return of the King) is much better than the original release, because the materials that are worthy are incorporated back into the story, and seamlessly so.  The most interesting (and frightening) addition are the Huorns, ent-like trees that move.  The final destruction of the Orcs, while not bloody (you don't even see them) is nonetheless more than a little disturbing. The added scenes with Faramir and Boromir together also helped flesh out the story a good deal.  A word of caution for the two or three people who've read Tolkien's books and not yet seen this movie: This installment of the LoTR diverts the farthest from the storyline in the novel.  Personally, I thought the changes, while giving Eowyn more exposure, were on the whole not helpful to the story line (most importantly, the residents of Edoras, rather than retreating to Dunharrow, actually move TOWARD Isengard to hole up in Helm's Deep.  Still and all, a tremendous movie, and one I'll enjoy seeing again.",1076803200,5,1192,4.935
1455972,2,B00005JKZU,"There are some records out there that have two or three good songs and the other ones are just boring filler material. In fact, I would bet that most albums are precisely like that. Well, this second ""Lord of the Rings"" episode proves that this kind of situations also happens with movies. I mean, this picture is well directed, the acting is competent and the sceneries and locations are excellent. But, for the most part, it`s an uninteresting, repetitive and long movie with few standout moments. It drags for about three hours, and at least two seem like lifeless and dull filler.
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was average either, but I was more tolerant since it was the first part of the trilogy and I could deal with the whole introductory scenes and the nonexistent character development. However, this second movie doesn`t get any better and still presents structural problems and an uneven pacing. When I was about to quit, something mildly engaging kept happening only to return to flat situations again. This flawed rythm persists during most of the movie, and at the end I thought this was an average flick at best.
Some characters hold promise, but they are never developed and seem like one (or two, in excepcional cases) dimensional individuals. Frodo`s dangerous obssession with the ring was interesting, yet it only became more gripping during the last minutes of the movie, after a tiresome and tedious battle sequence. I admit the cliffhanger at the end kept me somewhat curious about the third part, but with little excitement.
Director Peter Jackson has done quirky films in the past (""Heavenly Creatures"" was a much, much better ""fantasy"" movie than this overrated and disappointing trilogy) but here he isn`t more than a competent, by-the-numbers taskmaster. This is just another action-oriented flick with a tepid score and appealing eye candy. I`m really losing faith on this epic story.",1076716800,,1912,4.996865203761756

The Aragorn Arwen love interest gets a lot of attention as does Aowen providing more triangle tension.
Faramirs character/subplot gets much more attention and detailed thus making him a more ""real"" person.  I recall someone asserting racism to the Ring trilogy, with Faramirs story line in mind one can only say that those who are determined to find shall find their determination.
The climactic battle did not get much more attention, I had desired more detail on the sally out from the keep as I thought this was the weakest part of the battle.  The Ents did get more attention however Saruman was still a bystander to the fight.
Hard to nitpick  such a fine film but even with movie length extension footage the job is never finished.  This movie trilogy could go on and on and on... after all, we are only discussing the final chapters of the Third Age!

I'd have to say that the movies have been kept as close as possible to the book, although it has left out many a scene but c'mon, if Jackson actually tried to keep to the book, we'd be watching 8 hour movies or 10 sequels!  I know that it took me more than 3 hours to finish one book of LOTR but should a movie which is already packing as much detail as beautifully as it does become any longer?  It does also add more emphasis to women's roles in the movie which I felt was a refreshing take and a good call.  It doesn't have to be exactly the same as the book to be great and Jackson is a director who has more sense and creativity than to just take the story straight from the book.  To those who said the villains weren't scary enough, this isn't a horror movie like Friday the 13th which wasn't by the way scary and the emphasis is on friendship, bravery, and hope.

In the original cut, Faramir comes across as dark, cruel, curt and almost malevolent, a man who then at the end unexplainably lets the captive hobbits go. Of course, in the book Faramir is a noble character, who is only ever-so-briefly tempted by the ring.
The Extended Version shows that Jackson, while still deviating from the book, was attempting to explore the character of Faramir more deeply than even Tolkien bothered to. In extended footage, we see Faramir as a neglected son, desperate to win the confidence and love of his father, and thus tempted to bring the Ring to Gondor in order to ""prove his qualities."" A flashback effectively establishes the relationship between Farmir, his now late brother Boromir, and their less than noble father Denethor. Furthermore, an added monologue by Farmir musing over a slain Southron adds a degree of moral ambiguity and reflection to a war story that usually seems to be unabiguously good guy vs. bad.
The extended version also has an important scene developing Frodo's relationship with Gollum. Some critics and movie-goers complained that The Two Towers lacked much of the character interaction that made Fellowship so charming; much of that interaction was edited out in the original cut of Two Towers, but has been edited back in to the Extended Version.",1076198400,6,1531,5.055335968379446
1456133,5,B00005JKZU,The movie was right. It was one of the best movies i seen that month. That was like the only movie that continued it correctly. Like in the first one i thought Gandolf was dead when he got pulled of the cliff or bridge. because they didn't show where or how he had landed. You had to opinionate what happen. But in the 2nd one they showed clips from the 1st one and show what happen to him. I also like the characters in the movie and the battle and where the battle took place.,1076025600,,478,4.042105263157895

1456135,4,B00005JKZU,"The extended edition DVD's are just amazing. It gives you so much information on the movie that you never knew before. I will say some of the documentaries were rather boring, and really were stating the obvious. The cast commentaries can be hilarious at times, and boring at others. Honestly, I only baught this for the deleted scenes. They alone were worth the extra money. Most of them are so important to the story and you wonder why they would dare take them out. In the original releases there are alot of holes in the story, and alot of questions that go unanswered. When watching the extended edition alot of that is cleared up. They even add the scenes into the movie, instead of at the end like most other movies.
The Two Towers is the second in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and in my opinion the best. The first movie kind of drudged on with character development, and left you hanging at the end. This picks up directly where they left off, and even takes you back a little to remind you of what happened in FOTR. It's an action filled adventure that begins to take each character further into their emotional journey. They even add a bit of humor throughout most of it.
I started out watching the original releases. Then after the release of Return of the King, I read the books. I was a bit disappointed with the movies after that. They left out so much that was important, and completely changed part of the story lines. After reading the books I decided to begin watching the extended editions, which took away alot of that disappointment. There is much more to these films than was shown. The documentaries give you a bit of history on Tokien. They take you into the writing of the screen plays and explain why they had to change the story lines. They also give you an indepth look on the making of the movie, and further into the designing of the imagery. My favorite one is the one taking you into the creation of Gollum. It gives all these tid bits of information that make it even more spectacular than it already is.
I'd say if you're going to buy any of the LOTR DVD's you should buy the extended editions. They are far better than the others. It may seem like alot to be spending on a movie, but really when you think about it. $30 is not a bad price for 4 disks full of incredible detail.",1075852800,5,2315,4.386046511627907
1456136,5,B00005JKZU,"I have seen all three films and consider them to make up the greatest trilogy ever and this film is my favorite of the three!  I have seen it several times.
The band that got together on the journey to Mordor in the first film is split into 3 groups.  The Troll, Elf Archer and the man (who is destined to be king of men?) make up one band while Frodo and Sam make up the second band, and the other two Hobbits make up the third group.  We basically have stories going on simultaneously and the director brilliantly goes from one to the other.
The film introduces Smeagle, a ""Shrek-like"" animation who is one of the most fascinating characters in film history.  Frodo and Sam encounter Smeagle who becomes their ""guide.""  All the while Smeagle is a split personality, and his evil side is planning to steal the ring from Frodo (he calls it ""my precious"") and to kill Frodo and Sam.
The other two Hobbitts encounter a race of giant tree-men.  While the rest of the band go to a fortress to fight one of the best filmed battle scenes in movie history against a tremendous force of zombie-like warriors.  While watching the men in the fortress prepare for the battle you feel like the are like the men of the Alamo preparing to fight an inevitible losing battle against overwhelmingly large forces.  Amazing scenes show brave little kids and elderly being armed to fight againt the evil hordes.  The battle itself is so well directed and filmed that you feel you are right in the middle of it!",1075852800,,1490,4.468634686346864

The random horse that picks up Aragorn after his tumble down the cliff is explained. The endings seamlessly shift from LoTR: TT to LoTR: The Return of the King. From Merry and Pipin, the ring bearing group(Sam, Gollum, and Frodo), and Aragorn, each have scenes that meld this movie into the next. They should have been put into the movie, but most people couldn't sit through 223 minutes of Lord of the Rings(with this movie, I could have easily).
Most scenes further develop the characters, Eowyn's character is nicely rounded with more scenes with Aragorn. Faramir's desire of the ring goes much deeper than for the power of his people, that loose end it tied up in this edition.
What I liked most about the platinum series is the outtakes... and there are a lot of them. Everything about the movie, from how J.R.R. Tolkien painstakingly wrote the book, to the jaw-dropping performance of Andy Serkis(the man who MADE the personality of Gollum come to life(if he didn't get a Grammy/Golden Globe for his work, he should)), all is included. Galleries, galleries, galleries, and some of the pictures have commentary on how the picture/sculpture/scene was created.
Another neat feature are the several tracks of commentary throughout the movie. They take the place of the audio, and it's a neat addition if you wanted to further your understanding of the scenes.
All in all I recommend this edition of Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers to anyone's DVD collection. Well worth the extra money.",1075420800,5,1670,4.742268041237113

1456272,5,B00005JKZU,"Watching The Two Towers after having just read the book makes me all the more aware of how much Peter Jackson has adhered to the book.  True there are differences, but that is to be expected - for instance, the battle for Helm's Deep is not treated with as much emphasis in the book, but that is an understandable choice for making an exciting movie.
The thing that most impresses me in this movie is Gollum.  He could have easily turned into the Jar-Jar of the LOTR movies but he manages to be actually likeable.  He is almost a perfect realization of his character from the book, right down to his voice (notice how he coughs ""Gollum"").  We can understand why Frodo pities him because we pity him as well.  If it wasn't for the Ring, he'd be happy enough catching fish.  The Ents also are very well realized.  Watching Treebeard carry Merry and Pippin, I felt that I was getting a preview of what Jackson intends to do with the remake of King Kong.
The DVD also has the prerequisite ""making of"" documentaries.  It also has a short film directed by Sean Astin during his down time.  It is worth watching because, rumor has it that Astin is turning his talents to directing now and is in negotiations to film the movie version of The Fantastic Four.",1075161600,9,1249,4.442982456140351

Some scenes were better not to be added in the film but it doesn't mean that you souldn't add this version in your collection.

1456388,5,B00005JKZU,"Rarely do you run into a DVD version of a movie of this level. Peter Jackson set out to provide fans of LOTR with a treasure to keep for life, with an extended version of the movies (provided in two of the four discs, just like he did with the ""Fellowship..."") that thoroughly complements the story we saw in the theaters, along with an extra couple of discs devoted to telling the story behind the storytelling.
The added material was the result of uncovering a whole additional layer of footage that was left out for time reasons, but with the same quality of the rest of the movie, just having been edited out because it was not critical for the purposes of telling the story, yet I'd argue that it complements it in such a way that I can't conceive the movie without these moments now, such as the case of showing a prologue-like scene with Boromir, Faramir and their father, before Boromir set foot to Rivendell for the Council of Elrond.
As for the features, once again, the movie lent itself to a very broad array of things to share. I thought it would be impossible to top the features offered on the first Extended version, but Peter Jackson once more shut me up! The two extra DVDs of features from ""The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers"" had a wealth of information for the real LOTR fan. For example, I was blown away by the details behind the design and evolution of the look and performance of Gollum, from the initial sketches, all the way to accomplishing a sense of realism with translucent skin details. Also incredible was to see the level of detail behind putting together footage with its live sound with sound effects and score... If you take the time to watch all the features, you gain a new level of respect for the work Peter Jackson and his team did, and for moviemaking at large: it certainly involves so much work, that we normally take for granted as sheer moviegoers.
Needless to say I am anxious to see what the Extended Version of the third and last movie will have to offer. In the meantime, I will probably give myself a fix of LOTR 1 and 2 now and then to keep the memories fresh! :)",1074988800,10,2120,4.396946564885496

1456390,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" extended edition surpassed all of my expectations.  It amazes me about the criticism I hear from fellow Tolkien fans. I think that people need to remember two things before they invest so much time into this movie:  a.) transitioning a story from novel to the screen is an arduous task, which rarely ends up doing justice to the original work and b.) when dealing with a trilogy, the middle chapter seems to always get the blunt of critic abuse.  The thing to remember is, that ""Two Towers"" is astonishing from all parts:  the story sticks with the novel, all the major characters are represented, the special effects seem all too realistic and the film makers go into each character's personality without loosing the focus of the action.  Of course, scenes had to be added after the theatrical release, because of the length, but sometimes, the smallest overlooked dialogues can really flesh out a character and make him/her worth cheering for.  I personally felt that Gimli, the dwarf, was overlooked in the first movie, but I was excited to really see him develop as into this personal character, who was powerful and secretly sensitive to his comrades.
I don't think this movie was ""sloppy"" at all!  A lot of viewers, especially the younger generations, haven't read through the books yet.  Well, if anything, Tolkien certainly mastered the art of creating a world and giving it its: mythology, history and politics.  One could even go so far as to say that he wrote an alternative history in comparison to both the World Wars.  This, of course, makes reading through the volumes of writing as much a chore as an enjoyable magical experience.  Its translation to screen however, is just short of a miracle.  One can watch this and have a decent concept of what's going on, who the characters are and where everyone is going - without having read the books and not being too familiar with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" movie.  The several different story lines are all well explained and well developed.
As with the added scenes, if you didn't see the original theatrical release, you really couldn't tell where the new additions were put in.  In other movies, those transitions seemed awkward and you kind of wish they had just left them out.  It's the small details that really pack in a little humor and character bonds that help keep us invested in this war-torn epic.  The character of Golem was portrayed beautifully - as if great minds like Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft were called in for advice.  His mental instability really adds chilled and spooky premonitions on the viewers.  Also, we get a chance to invest in the humorous competitive friendship between the elf, Legolas, and the dwarf, Gimli.
The middle chapter shouldn't be a let-down.  It should cherished along with the brave opening in ""Fellowship"" and will certainly carry us through to the ultimate conclusions of ""Return of the King.""  There's no need to trash such fabulous efforts and ingenuity.  Sit down and enjoy!",1074729600,5,3011,4.841796875

Trimming the great story to the tastes of the average movie goer, the Producers and Director decided that giving it just enough action and the Occasional ""WOW Factor"" will abase and satisfy Moviegoers wordlwide. The old Hollywood recipe worked once again.
The artificiall action scenes, which pretend to make the story more interesting, completely weigh down any kind of emtional center,and cut loose any kind of connection and sympathy we might have developed with the Characters.
No only does the Hollywood Hype give the movie an air and noise feel, but it make obvious the complete lack of cinematic genuenity and the terribl weak script.

I'm a behind the scenes sort of geek and I loved the extra footage of how Peter Jackson and crew put everything together.  The real treat for me though was the behind the scenes music footage with Howard Shore composing the score.
Do I think ""The Two Towers"" is better than ""TFOTR?""  I lean more towards ""TFOTR"" because of its introduction to Tolkien's worlds.  However, my favorite character, Eowyn, is brought in with this one, and the Battle for Helm's Deep just flat out kicked ass. So, overall, I'm tied with these two.
What I liked about the extended edition also is the extra footage added.  We see the situation with Faramir and his complex relationship with his brother and father drawn out more which I was always interested in.

I also got the extended version of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  The extended version is definitely the best choice.  The extra footage explains some things that were not covered in the original film like the age of Aragorn which will shock you, the reason why Boromir tried to steal the ring from Frodo in the Fellowship and why Faramir is taking up his brother's cause.  This version just presents more depth overall story wise and character wise.
The general story continues as Frodo and Sam are separated from the rest of the Fellowship. They continue their journey to Mordor in the hopes of destroying the ring with the guidance of Gollum a former Hobbit. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli continue their search of Pippin and Merry who were taken by the Orcs. To the surprise of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli Gandalf returns to help them in the preparation of a battle with the people of Rohan against the Orcs at Helms Deep a fortress in the mountains. The battle scene is one of the best ever made. The special effects in creating Gollum are unsurpassed.

I am tired of people judging the Lord of the Rings if they have not read the books, DO NOT JUST judge this story from the movies and DO NOT judge the books by just reading 10 or 50 or even 100 pgs and saying oop! I'm done too boring! It took me about 100 pages to get into the book and understand what was going on..(I have since then re-read those 100 pgs +) at first yes sadly I'll admit I thought it was boring only because I hadn't the slightest clue what was going on.. but after I got in to it I loved it! and so here I am today sitting at the computer typing a review and completely frustrated at some of the reviews I've read dissing LotR big time.. okay I was going to write a bunch of stuff but why bother x_0

The spotlight of this film came from Elijah Wood, who brought the main charachter, Frodo Baggins, to life. He was at his best whenever the ring would call to him and he'd fall into the trance. Sean Astin was a strong supporter, but he became great in Return of the King. Ian McKellen was something else. As Gandalf, the white wizard, he performed brilliantly. Viggo Mortinsen was also great, and showed human emotions brilliantly. Especially when he was at Helm's Deep. The interaction between him and his enviroment was stunning.  Orlando Bloom is good as Legolas, but he could never equal the others in the movie. I was upset about the way they used Gimli... he seemed to be there strictly for comic relief. It was nothing like in the book where he killed hundreds of orcs. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan were both very good. However, Monaghan seemed stronger in this film where Boyd was better in Return of the King.

As in the first film in this series, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", it's an excellent swords and sorcery flick, featuring even more combat - everything from one on one fistfights to battle scenes of 10,000, all using the best in live action and realistic computer graphics animation.
For those who truly love the books, though, the movie may fall short.  As in ""Fellowship"", not enough time is spent on characterization, leaving many of the characters one or two dimensional; in some cases they bear only a superficial resemblance to their namesakes from the book.  In addition, one of Jackson's departures from Tolkien - presentation of Saruman as a mere minion of the evil Sauron, rather than as a would be competitor - grows from a minor annoyance in ""Fellowship"" to a major failing in ""Towers"", as it's the suppressed rivalry between Sauron and Saruman that drives much of the plot in this portion of the original novel.  As a result of this departure, for example, the orcs' conflict over where to take the captive Merry and Pippin in the original book is reduced to an argument over food, and one is left wondering why the bad guys fail to coordinate their attacks on Gondor and Rohan, rather than understanding that the uncoordinated timing results from differing goals.
Unlike the special edition of ""Fellowship"", the extended version of ""Towers"" does little to ameliorate these flaws; while the added scenes do tend to focus on characterization, Theoden still comes across as craven and Treebeard as hasty, contrary to the books.  Some of the added scenes, particularly the ones with Merry and Pippin, are quite humorous, though.
Note that there doesn't seem to be a way to view the shorter theatrical cut from this set of DVDs, so if you're primarily interested in fight scenes and don't care too much about Tolkien, you might want to stick with one of the other editions. If you're interested in more than fighting and patient enough to watch for four hours, this edition may be the one to get; if you're a Tolkien fan, the excellent packaging of this edition will make it look much better on the bookshelf, which is where these DVDs will spend most of their time.",1074297600,4,2332,4.791044776119403
1456504,1,B00005JKZU,"It cracks me up that all you losers are giving this movie five stars. Move out of your parents basements already and take a chance and kiss a girl. What is this movie but a bunch of wizards and dwarfs and fairys running around and killing eachother over a wedding ring? It's beyond laughable. I'd rather be electrocuted with high voltage testicular clamps than watch a movie with repressed queer eye for the straight guy themes. A bunch of men hanging out with fairys--""Oh yeah, I get it!"" This movie is all bad acting from the word go. I have a theory on why people love this trilogy. They feel that because the filmakers and writers and actors try so hard to make an ""Epic Saga of Biblical Proportions"" that they (the movie-goers) must give the film crew great reviews. I am different. I will not give good reviews to a movie just because it takes the time from middle earth till now, just to watch it. And now I, the great wizard will cast a spell. I call it the ""I'm too influenced by movie advertising and narrow minded hype storms to think for myself spell."" See, it's already working. Now go out and see the whole trilogy, fairy. While you're there, I'll be taking your girlfriend out to dinner.
Part Two: Clearly, my review has upset Ian V. Shiff (his review is just above mine). And having done such a thing I would now feel remiss if I did not offer a humble, heartfelt apology. So, I would just like to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're a nimble minded fool. I'm sorry that your vocabulary is so weak you have to resort to profanity just to get your point across, but most of all I'm sorry that you're a glasses-wearing acne-faced nerd. But if you want to blame somebody blame the Lord, and that's the Lord of humanity, not the Lord of the Dingleberries (just in case you got the two confused). And for the Lord's sake, stop wearing your hobit outfit to the movies (You look absurd and hobbits aren't real). And, contrary to what you'be been told, prancing around in your underwear while you re-enact the movie scenes in your bedroom is NOT cool, and chicks will not understand that.

1456505,5,B00005JKZU,"Following after The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers continues off with Frodo and Sam on the quest to bring the ring to Mt. Dune.  They discover later that Golem (Smeagle) is following them and they engage in confrontation.  They fight at first and they have Golem lead the way to the black gates.  Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimili set on their side of the journey to meet up with Frodo and Sam but also finding the other two hobbits (Merry and Pippin).  Merry and Pippin are taken by orcs and they escape into a forest where the tree's come alive at night.  They make friends with the leader of the woods and they go on an adventure together.  Later, Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimili meet up with someone they thought they would never see again.  They meet up with Gandalf who is now Gandalf The White after beating the ""ancient beast"" known in the first as ""shadow and flame"".  They reunite and set off to Mordor.  In my own opinion, I thought The Two Towers was alright when I saw the ORIGINAL theatrical release.  When I bought the Special Extneded DVD Edition, it was better because they show a lot of extra footage and extended takes which explained more like in the Fellowship on the extnded edition.  The Two Towers is something that everyone should have if you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings.  GO AND GET IT ^_^

Amazing directing by Peter Jackson. I have to say that I love this title more than the first, gives me the same feeling as Empire Strikes Back did Amazing and the best of the trilogy.
But it stops there because Return of the King is the Film of the Decade so far.

I have read everything by Tolkien ( except all that academic stuff he REALLY wanted to be remembered for)and I just live for this stuff! I even wish and dream of the day whem my fantasy novel gets made into a movie! I am a 35 year old writer of novels and I can only hope that my 1000000 page book will make such a wonderfull film!
This film SAVED my life! This film gave millions of people just like Me a reason to get up in the morning. Not to mention that The Lord of The Rings provided me with an excuse for social interaction. Yes, this is more than just a film folks, it is A WAY OF LIFE! Before this film I was nobody-now I am on a fantastic quest of my own! I WILL become the next Tolkien!!I might even get some of my buddies together and go on my own magical, mystical journey! Zooooom-a-loom! I have the power!
Everyone MUST see these films. They are not only the best that the world of cinema has to offer, but they are essential for helping mankind see his destiny! Yes folks they are THAT good. Now, if I could only meet a nice elve/gnome/hobbit woman to walk hand-in-hand with through this magical, mystical and fantastical universe! Is my princess out there? Maybe, Tolkien films and books lead to failure with the opposite sex? That's what my doctor says anyway. What does he know anyway? It's not like he is a wizard or anything!

1456615,5,B00005JKZU,"I never expected this.  When I sat through it in the theater, I thought The Two Towers was too long.  I felt the battle scenes were tiring, difficult to endure.  But, having been stunned with the extended Fellowship (far superior to the theatrical release), I decided to give the Two Towers another try.
To put it plainly, you really haven't seen this movie until you've seen the extended version.  Humor.  Important ""back stories.""  Better, more coherent editing.  Not only did the movie grip me and keep my attention for its entire length, I want to watch it again.  Soon.
This is a great investment in a great movie.  I can't recommend it highly enough for those who liked the theatrical versions, as well as those who came away disappointed to one degree or another.",1074038400,5,770,4.686567164179104
1456616,5,B00005JKZU,"Ah, sweet anticipation. That is what I have felt for almost a year before its release. After they released the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING-EXTENDED EDITION I was amazed at what they could do with a bunch of extra scenes. Almost everything they added was for fans of the  books, which I am proud to number as one of.
  So obviously I was excited about the TWO TOWERS EXTENDED, especially after seeing the theatrical version.  A beautifully rendered movie, but there was a lot that didn't sit well with me. Much dissapointment. But the extended tied up a lot of loose ends (& loose cuts), pulling the story a lot closer to the book than before, most notably with the new Boromir And Faramir scenes explaning the family dynamics and showing Faramir's true character. And once again there were a lot of new scenes just for the fans. ( did I mention that I'm one of them?)
  But still P.J. had a lot to answer for (at least to me) with the changes. And answer he did. The 2 appedix disks ( which I think were brilliant ideas to use, just calling them appendixes makes it feel Tolkien), are again chock full of interviews and info on how the movies were made. But still Pete had better have something to say for himself. This isn't a silly old question of ""where's Bombadil?"" or ""why's the pointy eared lady on Glorifindel's horse?"". No, I want to know why Faramir is a big meany taking them to Osgiliath of all places, and why Gollum looks and acts better than both hobbits he plays next to?!?!
  These and many more questions are answered, but it was really awesome to see David Wenham (Faramir) talk about his role. It was cool to see him having never read the books before imerse himself in them, and then reading the script and seeing how different the character was from the one in the book. Realising the fans would not be happy with this, he went to P.J. to see what was up. Now thats what I call integrity.  With some directors that might not go over to well but he did it any way. This is just one of the many examples of how committed cast and crew are to these films, Peter Jackson being among the most committed of them all. It has to be a hard job to fit the whole story into three films, and keep everyone happy.
  Getting back to the movie itself, my personal favorite scene is seeing Gandalf fighting the Balrog. An amazing scene that perfecly captures the stunning fall into a pit that had no recorded bottom.
  This is a movie that I would highly recomend to anyone who loves a great epic, nad even though this movie deviates from the book more so than the other two I think most fans of the books will enjoy as well.",1073952000,,2625,4.343558282208589
1456617,5,B00005JKZU,"When The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" premired a little over 2 years ago, I marvelled at the magnificence and sheer beauty of a film which so wonderfully captured the essence of the J.R.R. Tolkein novel of the same name. I sat spellbound for most of three hours, completely captivated by the imagery set before me. Then, when I received the ""Fellowship"" on DVD later that year, I was re-introduced to Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth in a way that allowed me to once more delve into this immensely beautiful film, and I found that with additional viewing, I learned more about the characters, the places and the events that unfold in the film.  It made owning the film a pricelss addition to my film library.
I am thrilled and delighted to say that I have had the same experience with ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". This second installment of the film continues where ""Fellowship"" leaves off, with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) continuing their quest onward to Mount Doom. Along the way, they capture and befriend Gollum, who had initially sought them out in hopes of reclaiming the ring, his ""Precious"".
Things are amiss in Middle Earth as Suraman (Christopher Lee), under the eye of Sauren, continues building an orc army that will be used to rise up against the powers that oppose Mordor. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhyse-Davies) are in pursuit of thier captured counterparts, Merry(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin(Billy Boyd), two hobbits who ventured out by chance with Frodo and Sam in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
As with the novel by the same title ""The Two Towers"" expands the realm of Middle Earth, and introduces us to many new characters, including the beautiful Eowen (Miranda Otto), daughter to King Theoden, who finds herself falling for the mysterious Aragorn when he helps free her father from the manipulations of Sauren.
This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who has been fortunate enough to experience any part of this major epic movie series. These films go far and beyond any undertaking of this magnitude thus far and the results are films of such quality that they will forever raise the bar for filmmakers in the future. Make this collection a part of your DVD library. If these films continue to achieve the acclaim that Tolkien's original ""Ring"" series has maintained in the literary world, than these films promise to entertain for generations to come, providing a canvas which contains some of the most beautiful, elaborate and indeed, complex cinematography ever seen.

I have the hobbit  book and i will read it when i get a chance. This movie is so good and i loved it because all the work they put in to making this movie.

1456621,5,B00005JKZU,"First, let me say that I adore the books.  This extended version of the film adds many scenes that fans of the books (and also those who haven't read them) will enjoy.  We get more Merry & Pippin.  More Ents and ""awakening"" trees.  More Gollum/Smeagol.  A flashback which tells us more about Faramir, Boromir and their father.  And some priceless interaction between Legolas and Gimli.  The extended version of this and the first film really fill in so much detail that they shouldn't be missed by anyone who liked the theatrical releases.
The appendices are also excellent.  Having seen the additional material on The Fellowship of the Ring extended addition, I thought, ""Do they really have enough behind-the-scenes info to fill up two more discs?""  And the answer is definitely - Yes!  As someone who has never been a big fan of how'd-they-do-that documentaries of films, I was surprised to find myself rivited by these.  Knowing all the detail and hard work that has gone into these films makes me love them all the more.  Additionally, anyone familiar with the books who wondered why they changed Faramir's character so drastically, you will get an explaination here.  (I still don't really agree with it, but at least I know what they were thinking now.)  And they go over the reasoning behind the changes to the ending as well.
Another feature of this addition is the packaging itself.  The outside slipcover is made to resemble a leather-bond book.  Inside you will find the case, booklet, and the discs themselves decorated with artwork and concept sketches from the artists who helped design the film.  The onscreen menus continue the book theme and also show many wonderful sketches.

The Two Towers was a good film to begin with... but the extra 43 minutes was definitely worth sitting through!  I normally don't even like this type of movie, but now that I've seen all three, the LOTR trilogy ranks among my favorite films of all time.  Peter Jackson did a lot right with these films, even if they do deviate slightly from Tolkien's books.  First of all, he surrounded himself with capable actors/actresses.  No performer puts in a bad acting performance, and the people chosen to play the particular characters fit the roles very well.  Second, the music is phenomenal.  Music is one of the most important non-visual atmospheric impact parts in any movie, and Jackson realized that in the making of this film.  The music is melancholic most of the way, and where in most films you'd expect a bold, triumphant orchestra piece, here you've got a sorrowful violin solo.  Great effect.
The filmmaking and script writing was great, and I think everyone who's tired of the meaningless pop-culture junk the motion picture industry is turning out these days should watch this.",1073606400,4,1173,4.85929648241206

I thought the changes made in The Two Towers theatrical release treated the audience as if it was dumb and disrespected Tolkien's characters.
THIS DVD ADDS A LOT OF THE DEPTH TO BOTH CHARACTERS AND STORY THAT GOT LEFT ON THE EDITING FLOOR.
PROS
* The added scenes have given the Ents the depth of character and nobility that they had in the books; also, Pip and Merry no longer spend the whole movie riding around on Treebeard's shoulders
* MORE GOLLUM, MORE GOLLUM, MORE GOLLUM! Can you get enough of that guy?  Andy Serkis should get a best supporting actor!
* *Great* scenes at the end that summarize the three main story lines (Pip & Merry at Isengard, Aragorn and others at Helm's Deep, and Sam and Frodo leaving Osgilliath for Mordor)
* Added scenes of Saruman and Wormtongue that explain their decision to seige Helm's Deep
* *Wonderful* added dialogue between Eowyn and Aragorn where she figures out his kingly heritage--and that he's 87 years old but is of a blood-line that has long lives
* And this was the clincher for me: the added footage shows that Jackson really didn't change Faramir's character from Tolkien; we get to see a brilliant scene in which the conflict Faramir faced to steal the ring from Frodo because of his desire for his father, Denethor's, approval is explained; so, Faramir wasn't changed from a good guy to a bad guy; he was just conflicted
* MORE GREAT EXTRAS, INCLUDING A PIECE ON HOW ANDY SERKIS' MASTERFUL PORTRAYAL OF GOLLUM SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE ENTIRE MOVIE FOR THE BETTER
CONS
* It is the weakest of the three movies and the one that I will view the least--but I will view it many, many times
* Gimli still comes off like a goof; I still think Jackson just should've cast some wiseacre comedian in the role if that is what he was going to do to Tolkien's noble warrior
* The Helm's Deep battle scene still drags on a little long, still has some cheesy dialogue (""And so it begins...""), and still has unbelievable plot developments (Oh, yeah, there's a secret door that lets Aragorn and Gimli out to fight the Orcs on the bridge!)
PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION
Run, don't walk, to buy this!  It is the weakest of the three movies, but it's still better than most directors' best movie by a long shot.",1073606400,2,2413,4.589327146171693

Peter Jackson managed to pull off the impossible and make a wonderful trilogy of the wonderful books by J.R.R. Tolkien. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is first-rate, the music is gorgeous; all in all, this is a masterpiece of moviemaking.
Also, it is not too long. Those of you who think so clearly aren't intelligent enough to understand what is going and are therefore bored.",1073520000,,512,4.965116279069767
1456760,5,B00005JKZU,"First off, I absolutely LOVE this movie (and all three movies for that matter).  My favorite parts of Two Towers are the Gollum scenes, the breath-taking and spectacular battle at Helm's Deep, and the Golden Hall scenes and an honorable mention to the overly dramatic scenes of Elrond.
There are some extra scenes in this movie that are great and really help set up ""Return of the King"".  There are some other parts that are good and add to the enjoyment of the movie.  There are a few others though that I could do without.
By far the best scene was the ""Faramir, Boromir, and Denethor"" flashback.  It would have been helpful to have seen this before ROTK.  I also enjoyed all the new scenes toward the end of the film as they did much to enhance the story (especially the ents finishing the battle at Helm's Deep and Faramir's farewell to Frodo, Sam, and Gollum).  Even though Treebeard is one of my favorite characters, I found most of his added scenes to be unnecessary and hindered the flow of the story; although many fans of the books may enjoy those scenes as they make reference to several things in the books.
So, the question is, is this worth buying?  Yes, I would say so.  The added scenes that are good are well-worth the money.  I do have to say the added scenes in ""Fellowship"" were better than the ones added here for ""Two Towers"".  At any rate, it is an exceptional movie and most of the added scenes do make it easier to understand plot points in ""Return of the King"".",1073520000,3,1487,4.4338235294117645
1456761,5,B00005JKZU,"My first thought after finishing 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was HOW are they going to translate 'The Two Towers' into a credible movie??  My mind raced at a thousand miles-an-hour knowing that if they screwed up just one major element that it could spell doom for the two remaining movies.  I thought first to Treebeard and how they were going to bring the Ents to life on screen and make it look *right*...I then wondered about Gollum and how a full digital character could be brought to life convincingly enough for the public to actually believe he is a real living breathing creature...how could the battle at Helm's Deep be done at ALL??  I am happy to say that Peter Jackson has very much earned the tremendous respect of Tolkien fans the world over by bringing together one of the most talented filming crews to ever work on ANY movie, and literally breathing life into a tremendous story.  As good as 'The Two Towers' was on the big screen, the extended version on dvd is in fact even better.  So MUCH was left out that could have (some say SHOULD have) been included, and overall gives us fans an even better understanding of how incredibly daunting the task of bringing all of this to the big screen really was.  The extra footage was definitely worth the wait.  An additional 43 MINUTES of scenes, some just extending existing shots, and some entirely new scenes make this edition well worth watching.
I personally enjoyed the extra footage of Faromir with Boromir and their Father at Osgiliath, which helps explain further his actions in 'Return of the King' and Merry & Pippen in the Fangorn Forest drinking and growing taller...a scene I felt was sorely missed from the theatrical edition.  What really added to the enjoyment of this special dvd was the extra 2 discs which go into great detail on the making of these tremendous films and gives even the dullest layperson a small glimpse into just how incredibly difficult the job of filming the entire 3 movies must have been.  Even though they talk (at length sometimes) of how hard this project was, they talk just as much about how rewarding it was, because in the back of their minds they ALL knew that they were making history.  One of the most facinating portions of the extra discs was the creation and making of Gollum.  From Andy Serkis who literally BECAME Gollum to how Peter Jackson did an about face after 'The Fellowship' had already been released and MUCH of the principle filming of Gollum had been finished and told his digital production crew that they needed to re-do Gollum to more closely match the facial features of the voice done by Andy.  They go into detail about how impossible this task was, but how as they went about fulfilling Peter's mandate, they created a much better character and a much better movie in the process.  I'm absolutely shocked that Andy was passed over at the Golden Globe & Oscars for a nomination because of how utterly convincing this character was.  The extended dvd far surpassed my expectations and helped to whet my appetite for the crowning achievement that is 'The Return of the King' the absolute best movie of the trilogy and one of the best pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen and should not just be nominated for Best Movie, it really ought to win.  I can think of NO other films I have ever seen that has evoked such tremendous emotions in me, and Peter Jackson and everyone associated with making these movies should be revered for all-time for doing true justice to the books which have been beloved by readers the world over for over 50 years.  Absolutely fantastic and HIGHLY recommended.",1073520000,,3624,4.665620094191523
1456762,5,B00005JKZU,"I basically look at any movie, once it can show me that it does not have a predictable storyline in contrast to a 'unique' storyline. Being critical and scrutinizing certain movies are ineveitable. Every single mistake that any particular director makes is always sought out by professional movie critics. And then there are the director's and producer's who make an absolutely spectacular film...ones that leave you in awe...ones that you see in the cinema and come out with your jaw wenched open...those are the movies that stay with you till the ends of time...
I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan...i mean who isn't? The skill of Peter Jackson in bringing this movie to life from J.R.R Tolkein's amazing and spectacular book is unbelieveable and almost non-human. I was not disspointed by any of his movies in the triology...they all did justice to Tolkein's books...

1456869,5,B00005JKZU,"I hated the theatrical version of TTT for a number of reasons, the most important of which was that although the film sort of followed the general outlines of Tolkien's work, the writers had disgarded everything that made the book worthwhile in order to impose a ridiculous amount of screenwriterly conflict. For example, having the Ents reject war with Saruman is bad enough, but to have Eomer exiled wrecks the development of his relationship with Aragorn, and finally, to turn Faramir into a callow jerk in order to put some threat at the end of the film was to me a crime beyond forgiveness.
This extended version, however, is a whole new film, and one that I found myself admiring.  There are new scenes and extended scenes that give us more of the actual story and allow the characters to breathe in this massive space. My dislike of Faramir's character was lessened by inclusion of much of his backstory, particularly his love for his brother Boromir and his inability to please his father.  Additional scenes at the end of sequence with Sam and Frodo bring this character, despite the changes in the screenplay, closer to the original character.
Deadlines had a lot to do with why New Line didn't release these versions instead of the chopped up versions that made it into most theaters - most films are designed to sell popcorn, and I guess a film this long would limit sales of Milk Duds and Diet Coke - and TTT also had to be in theaters for Xmas release.
The last thing I ever thought I'd be doing was giving The Two Towers a five-star rating, but since I've seen the extended version, I must do just that.",1073520000,,1618,4.595155709342561
1456870,4,B00005JKZU,"These special edition DVD sets for the two Lord of the Rings films are impressive achievements.  On the 4 DVDs of the Two Towers there is no wasted space.  Due to the length of the film, the feature itself covers two discs and looks/sounds fantastic on my system (albeit an older/smaller system).  The next two DVDs contain documentaries on all aspects of the filmaking from the preproduction storyboards to the postproduction generation of special effects.  For my money, the documentaries are better (more interesting, flow better) than the equivalent documentaries on Film #1.  At 6 hours on each of the two films, there is bound to be some overlap between the docs on Film #1 and #2, but it's surprisingly small, to the credit of the DVD producers.  I'll admit that I haven't watched all the extras (i.e. I haven't listened to all 4 audio commentaries), but so far I've been impressed by the lack of overlap and overall level of interest the extras generate.
At nearly 4 hours, the extended version of the film is 45 minutes longer than the theatrical release.  Most of the additions are well worthwhile, adding depth and comedy to the action.  However, I have the same objection to this film as to the first - it's not what Peter Jackson has left out that's the problem, it's that he's tried to include too much, which makes some parts confused and/or overcrowded.  There are three basic stories that need to be told in this film: 1. Frodo and Sam trying to reach Mordor, with Gollum as guide; 2. The siege of Helm's Deep and the recruitment of Rohan to the cause; and 3. Merry, Pippen, and the Ents attack on Isengard.  Everything else is subsidiary and should have been done away with.  For example, Jackson cuts the Fords of Isen battle way back, but there's no reason to introduce it at all!  Likewise: while it's important to introduce Faramir, there is no reason to depict Frodo and Sam's imprisonment by him.

This is why the film blows up beyond all rational time limitations, and why the dense Tolkien books are so difficult to translate to the screen.  Jackson does do an admirable job at an impossible task, but anyone who has not read the books will be unable to keep track of all the characters, let alone follow all the intracacies of the plot.  The films then reduce to a series of massive battles.  However, fans of the books are likely to find much to like about the film.  In fact, I would rate this one higher than the first film - Jackson seems to cover more material in the same amount of time, and I think most of the Two Towers is on the screen, although the film ends considerably before the book.  (e.g., Gandalf does not get to Isengard, and Sam and Frodo do not reach Shelob's lair)
Therefore, fans of the film should not bother with any DVD version other than this one.  The Two Towers is a spectacle not to be missed.  The added scenes are well worthwhile (more so than many that survived into the theatrical cut, in fact).  The film itself is superior to the first film overall, although my favourite sequence remains the Weathertop battle from the first film.",1073520000,3,3095,4.580762250453721

This movie is the worst or the 3. Only see it to get the basic picture of what happens between the 1st and 3rd movies. It is dreary, unimaginative and badly filmed. All the actors have gone weird and tried to make the movie their own, while all failing. It has no scenes that give you a real feeling of the trilogy and the scenes themselves do nothing but explain, or repeat, what's happening.
Do not bother buying it unless you're one of those nuts who has to have the whole series, no matter what. The other two are great, however.",1073520000,,565,4.339622641509434
1456872,5,B00005JKZU,"In Brief
The second in the trilogy begins in the hills of Emyn Muil, where Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) discover they are being tracked by the mysterious Gollum (Serkis).  Elsewhere in Middle-Earth Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom), and Gimli (Rhys-Davis), encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom and its King who is under the spell of Saruman (Lee) & the manipulations of his spy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).  Gandalf (McKellen) has been reborn as Gandalf the White (that's not a spoiler - look he's on the poster) following his cataclysmic fight with the Balrog.  While hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) escape from the Uruk-hai and flee into the mysterious Fangorn Forest.  All this and the battle for Middle-Earth begins as the ring continues on its journey to Mordor.
Review
Well its hard to believe but the second part is better than the first.  This is a truly beautiful film, the result of a group of people's love for a book that has taken so many to Middle-Earth from their bedrooms, commutes, or lives in general.  The second part takes us further into the story of the journey of the ring, the trials of the now broken fellowship, and the quest that lays ahead.  As the stories have split, there is more to get your teeth into than the first film as we crosscut from each of the groups and their latest encounters.  Where there were brief lags in The Fellowship of the Ring this narrative device allows Jackson to control the pacing at a far better level.
While the aerial shots are numerous at times, they provide a simple way around the scale difference of the character's sizes as well giving us some beautiful imagery of the Middle-Earth landscape.  It is a place that its creators have made a believable realm - a place that IS there without question - where reality and fantasy collide into a unifying form that is real unto itself.  While some may question the following comparison, to me LOTR has the scope, majesty, spirit, action, and fantasy of any Kurosawa film, indeed if he were alive today I'd be hard pressed to say that it hadn't been made by the great man himself.
The film works so well on various levels; the shear scope gave me many a chill, and the acting is beautifully woven into the tapestry that is this film.  There are some marvellously subtle moments; indeed the connection through the blue watery eyes of Gollum, Frodo and Wormtongue strikes interesting comparisons in the back of ones mind.  Here is a creature who has literally been torn in two by his addiction to the ring, there is Frodo who is finding the `weight' of his task is starting to affect his very being, while finally there is a man who has never touched the ring yet is affected by its power and is as twisted as the creature that has become Gollum.  Gollum, who possessed the ring prior to Bilbo, is one of the outstanding cast members of the film.  He is a CGI character whose voice and movements were captured from the performance of Andy Serkis, yet his work and the work of the artists who created the image we see upon the screen completely destroyed any prejudice I had against CGI characters as Gollum delivers a strong performance of internal conflict, deception, and is the full embodiment of Tolkien's slimy hissy being.  Finally, special mention must be given to Rhys-Davis' Gimil, a dwarf who is as fierce and as bold as he is comic and who acts as reminder that throughout the turmoil and destruction we witness there is always room for laughter.
The Verdict

A testament to the abilities of everyone involved that the unfilmable book has reached our screens, succeeding in every department that one may have had doubts in.  It is a beautifully complex film that neither patronises nor confuses it audience and though will not contain all the moments from the book every fan desires to see, it certainly has every essence of the spirit that is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.",1073433600,4,3915,4.691970802919708

""Masterpiece"" is a word too often thrown around by those who shouldn't be throwing it around but in this case I guess I'll be one of those people.  The two towers will stand up under it's own feet but it has the thankless task of having the job of being the second movie in a trilogy that's basically design to hold the other two pieces together.  It not only does this in spectacular form but it also manages to propell us into the third film with Sean Austin's stirring, stirring speech at the end.

1456876,4,B00005JKZU,"'The Two Towers' is as good as the first installment - if not better.  Jackson did the smartest thing in trilogy movie history by filming all three movies at once.  The continuity is there - and it's flawless (take *that* George Lucas).  As with the first movie - the additional/extended scenes put into the feature itself is so seamless - as opposed to most DVD extras where 'deleted scenes' are extras and not in the context of actual film.
The length of the movie is no issue - it's long, but like 'The Fellowship of the Rings', it zips by and you're left wanting more.
Casting is superb - and before I had seen, I questioned the CGI-ness of Gollum.  But Andy Serkis probably wasn't off the mark thinking he should be eligible for a supporting actor nomination (it should defintely go to Sean Astin for ROTK though).
Unlike others who purchased this set - I did not have issues w/duplicates of same disks in my package nor are any of the disks defective (and I bought this on the first day of release).  I really enjoyed the extras and the movie making process - including adapting and interpreting of Tolkien's work.
If there's a flaw - the audio mix can seem muddled from time to time.  It's not my tv - and I don't think it's the actors.  Sometimes the music seemingly drowns out the dialogue.

1456997,5,B00005JKZU,"The first image of 2002's *The Two Towers* is that of a snowy vista, deep within the rock-chain of the Misty Mountains.  Wreathed in sunset colors, this brief panorama is at once cold, imperious, and hauntingly pristine. Howard Shore's melancholic strings both articulate and enhance the mood intended: a moment of calm - of natural, pure-earth stillness - before the coming darkness, the storms and tribulations that threaten the ancient fields of Middle-Earth.
The camera shifts away and we, the audience, are sent upon a slow, ominous journey across eroded ridge and ice-sheet; voices emerge, dreamlike, full of remembrance past.  Then the dream shifts to nightmare, and we are thrust back to the climax of *Fellowship of the Ring,* watching two Maia duel upon the bridge of Khazad-dum.  One cannot help but feel a sort of tragic inevitability viewing this confrontation, a sort of ""pathos rehashed:"" Gandalf is whipped down into the shroud, as before... but instead of wailing hobbits and heartrending music to jog a tear from the eye, the camera instead follows the wizard on his plunge into the depths of the earth.  Gandalf grasps his sword, fierce determination stark upon his wizened face. Ferocious chanting roils up from the sound-mix, augmenting the rising tension, foretelling a clash of angelic and daemonic titans. The subsequent battle is a dizzying, wrenching blend of shaky-cam, stunning CGI prowess and gut-punch editing; just as Gandalf and the Balrog are smashed through stone and the cold waters of an underground lake, so in turn are we, the fickle audience, brought crashing into the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings.
This opening is my favorite of 2002, and possibly of all time.  Not only do I find the Gandalf/Balrog clash incredibly effective - even awe-inspiring - as a piece of popcorn spectacle, this scene *exemplifies* the current peak of technological advancement the film industry is now experiencing...and Gollum, our sweet schizophrenic ""precious,"" goes beyond any CGI character to date.  0's and 1's combine to create something that actually feels alive, suffering and breathing before our very eyes, opposed to so many other computer caricatures. Gollum was a mighty gamble for Peter Jackson and his collaborators: in a cast of basic archetypes, his is one of the most complex roles, something not normally assigned to the late-hour skills of computer animators.
That they pulled it off, and so well, came as a surprise initially, but not in hindsight.  Jackson's LotR combines the ""classical"" style of 20th century epic-filmmaking - breathtaking vistas, carefully-wrought melodrama, larger than life heroes and villains coupled with small, quiet moments of drama - all the while incorporating the digital tools of the 21st century on such a compellingly *emotional* level that it has no problem ensnaring the audience into a fantastical environment without alienating them by the oft-plasticity ""shine"" that infects so much use of CGI.  The pathos of Smeagol/Gollum, the peril of the Two Towers, the plight of Middle-Earth and its varied peoples...these threads captivate us, pull at the heart-strings with the fingerwork of a master-puppeteer.
Now with that said... as I settled in to watch this Extended Edition, my expectations soared; my excitement was hard to contain.  Fellowship was a masterwork, made even better by its Extended Edition, yet I had found the second chapter unsatisfactory in the theater.  TTT bulged uncomfortably at its seams, the editing somewhat choppy, the slice-in-dice cuts quite obvious: there was simply too much story for a `mere' 3 hours (!) to properly elucidate.  Jerky pacing plagued the first hour, with certain transitions almost painful in their reveal of the drastic butcher-work used to shave the movie into a respectable length.  Even the ending, although magnificent in design, came to a too-abrupt denouement, a hurried wrap-up that left one acutely aware of all that missing.
It is obvious to me now that Peter Jackson et al. had the extended possibilities of the DVD in mind while scripting and crafting these films: in Extended Edition form, TTT finally feels *complete,* fully realized in a way that the theatrical edition could only hint at.  Moreover, TTT is now the worthy successor of the first chapter, equal to and in some ways surpassing FotR in terms of character, scope and epic-style storytelling.
A few improvement examples:
Faramir, perhaps *the* greatest sticking point, is fully redeemed here.  His very first scene in the Extended is more true to the book-character than _anything_ in the theatrical.  The flashback scene helps to change Faramir from an ambiguous and self-serving rascal to a learned but conflicted man, one struggling with his place and destiny in a world gone mad.
Eowyn is fleshed out in a few extra scenes: her final confession to Aragorn peaks her character-arc and sets the foundation for her role in the final movie.
Out of all the myriad storylines, the thread of Merry and Pippin in Fangorn Forest easily benefits the most from the Extended treatment.  The new scenes help bridge a much-needed *consistency* to this vital subplot thread; while in the theatrical the ""other"" hobbits were reduced to mere footnotes, here Merry and Pip help balance out the comical equation (the pipe-weed scene was especially endearing) while setting in motion one of the most important military coups of the battle for Middle Earth.
The extras are voluminous, covering many of the important factors of film-creation, including editing, sound, and CGI.  The documentaries also reveal how stressful TTT was to make: stuck between the beginning and concluding chapters, TTT was the pillar between: it had to stand strong and cast its shadow long.
Overall, the additional time restored to TTT make it weightier, more resonant, a stronger film as a whole.  Scenes are allowed to breath, characters to develop, conflict to rise and peak upon the walls of Helm's Deep.  Although it has neither a true ""beginning"" nor ""end,"" the Extended Edition of TTT is a masterpiece in its own right, and the perfect middle-chapter for the LotR trilogy.

1456998,5,B00005JKZU,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING seemed unsurpassable.  But it happened!  And that's because now we have THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS, a moviemaking masterpiece second only to three films: THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GODFATHER, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING.  The film deals with the Fellowship after their seperation.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to Mt. Doom; at the same time, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) are fighting a vicious battle against the forces of evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).

You know what the movie's synopsis is. The cool thing about the extended eddition is that almost every extra scene is put in perfectly. If you were to watch this without ever seeing the theatrical version you would probably not be able to see where they added in the new scenes. The first disc has a lot of extra scenes with orcs. There is also one about Pippin growing. The second disc has the bulk I would say. There are a lot of enjoyable new segments. A great addition is the Boromir scene which was sadly cut from the theatrical release.
The commentary is brilliant. Well, the actor's commentary is. I haven't watched the others yet. The actor's all have storys to tell, and there are quite a few good ones. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum tend to argue a lot. Sam always has to tell you how extroadinary or amazing something was using his huge vocabulary. They are sadly boring. The highlight of the commentary is Merry and Pippin. They own disc one. The second disc they don't get to do that much except the few ending scenes where they get some words in. Theodin owns disc 2 with hilarious stories every time he talks. He has a lot of stories that will make you crack up. Also, he uses some curse words but they beep them out.

With the quality of movie-making behind this franchise, it's no small surprise the stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor is outstanding. Many people agree that specific cut scenes were absolutely vital to giving certain characters more depth and I applaud Peter Jackson for putting on, what, 43 more minutes? If you haven't read the books, then the extended version is what you need. I guess for pacing and time constraints, they cut what they needed to, but on DVD, neither of these things hamper the original cut. Also, I'm not aware of another movie franchise that puts so much extra/special features onto their DVDs (maybe because so much went into making the movies).

While the plot flows fine without them, they add new depth to the characters.  I thought the additions for Merry and Pippin especially were hilarious, adding, among other material, a fight over the Entwater and over which one is taller, as well as a brief allusion to the missing Old Man Willow.  Gollum, meanwhile, has expanded scenes showing his insane lust for the Ring, which make him seem both more treacherous and more pitiable.  While most of the additions are fairly minor scenes, an entire segment has been added at the end, which makes the connection from the end of this movie to the start of the Return of the King flow much better.
Furthermore, while I am not typically a fan of Widescreen format, I have to say that it is nearly essential here.  The cinematography of this film is absolutely beautiful, and the modified format really loses a great deal of the epic grandeur.

The Palantir of Orthanc scene could have been included at the expense of the Osgiliath scene and the somewhat hokey Wargs and Aragorn-over-the-cliff stuff could easily have been sacrificed to allow Shelob in the TT.

1457093,5,B00005JKZU,"After much hype and anticipation, it is finally here. The second installment of The Lord of Rings series enters theaters almost one year to the date after the first film became a huge success at the box office. New Line executives are hoping now famous director Peter Jackson can continue the magic not only in the beautiful film making but in the potential box office as well. The first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring, grossed an astonishing $300 million domestically alone with more rolling in as the film opened internationally and became on DVD. After a pretty moderate year based on the number of releases, New Line is hoping for bigger returns with the first sequel. The Two Towers will have many challenges ahead of it including the lessened amount of anticipation that The Fellowship had leading up to its release a year earlier. Can the ring of power rule the box office once more? If Tolkein fans have anything to say, they are just hoping it rules the Oscars as well.
The Two Towers picks up where Fellowship left off with Frodo Baggins and Sam heading toward Mount Doom with the ring of power to destroy it. As they draw ever closer to land of Mordor, the two hobbits realize that they are not alone. The creature Gollum, who once possessed the ring, has been following them and later helps them in their quest. Meanwhile, Sarumen has nearly completed his vast army of 10,000 creatures and sets them out to destroy the human race, sparing no one. Elsewhere, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel in search of their hobbit friends and come upon the ravaged people of Rohen as they head to the fortress of Helms-Deep in a final standoff again the powers of Sauron. Though the end looks grim, the audience learns that there is hope in even the most desperate situations. Though The Two Towers comes in at a lengthy three hours (two hours and fifty-nine minutes if you want to talk specifics), Peter Jackson does a wonderful job at not making the film feel like such a long feature. The flow of the film is much more consistent then its predecessor which suffered from several lengthy breaks from the action sequences. There are less moments of no action which works all to this films advantage.
Most of the characters are the same as they were except for a few new characters that are introduced in The Two Towers. One of those characters is the creature Gollum, who has conflicting emotions and an eerie consciousness of what is going on. But when he expresses those thoughts in the film, they come off more as comic relief then a great dramatic performance. Not an Oscar winning performance in the least. Elijah Wood continues his great performance as Frodo Baggins. He seems pretty confident with this character and though he not seen as much as he was in Fellowship, he plays his limited scenes very well even with the computer generated Gollum, which can prove difficult even for the most experienced actors. John Rhys-Davies' Gimli in turned more into the comic relief of the picture as was the situation with Ron Weasley in Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets but for some reason, it works better here. His character was meant to be the comic relief and those hilarious moments are needed to contrast the many dark aspects of the feature. Orlando Bloom is great at Legolas once again and many will look forward to his performance outside The Lord of the Rings in next summer's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
Overall, The Two Towers achieves a rare feat of out doing its predecessor in almost every aspect of the film making process. Director Peter Jackson doesn't waste a single second of the three hour feature and stylizes everything in a wonderful style. The story is more consistent then that of Fellowship with action sequences spread out and less relay time between one battle sequence and the next. The actors and actresses within the films, much of which were also in Fellowship, seem more in tune with their characters, which is so important in bringing about a truly powerful trilogy such as this. The musical score wasn't quite as accelerating as the previous entry but its does get your heart pounding for the Battle of Helms-Deep near the end. He obviously is important to the story but is he intentionally that annoying? Does the movie-going public need more obnoxious characters like Jar-Jar Binks or Dobby the house elf? At least in the more dramatic moments they could have made him less annoying but made their attempt was to make him as pathetic as possible. Outside of those squabbles, The Two Towers is nothing short of a masterpiece. Fans of the fantasy film series won't be disappointed for sure and those not familiar with the Ring series will find the feature delightfully surprising. Anticipation has already started to build up for the final installment, The Return of the King, next Christmas.",1072742400,,4870,4.750885478158206
1457183,4,B00005JKZU,"The first of the series LOTR's was a slightly better than average movie, but an excellent adaption of the books.  This trilogy actually gets better as it goes along.  Once I had both enjoyed and suffered through LOTR I, I was able to savor most of TWIN TOWERS, but there were parts that just made me want to take a nap.  I am not a fan of extremely long camera shots of facial expressions, especially given the limited range of expressions emotted by some of the hobbits in particular.  Liv tyler also only had one facial expression, her grim poker face.  I give LOTRF 4 stars and RETURN OF THE KING 5 stars.  The special effects and the masterful battle sceens are an absolute WOW!

If you thought the first one was long, get out the popcorn and get comfortable because this movie has tons of footage not seen in the theatre! I don't suggest this for kids under the age of 12 because it is so long and they might get bored easily. Other than that, there is nothing except a violent war scene that would be bad for them to watch. I love the excellent extra features which explain how the movie was made, and has commentaries with the people that made the film. What is better than that?

1457185,5,B00005JKZU,"When The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" premired a little over 2 years ago, I marvelled at the magnificence and sheer beauty of a film which so wonderfully captured the essence of the J.R.R. Tolkein novel of the same name.  I sat spellbound for most of three hours, completely captivated by the imagery set before me.  Then, when I received the Expanded ""Fellowship"" on DVD later that year, I was re-introduced to Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth in a way that further expanded the realm and characters that were so marvelously created in his film.
I am thrilled and delighted to say that I have had the same experience with ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"".  This second installment of the film continues where ""Fellowship"" leaves off, with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) continuing their quest onward to Mount Doom.  Along the way, they capture and befriend Gollum, who had initially sought them out in hopes of reclaiming the ring, his ""Precious"".
Things are amiss in Middle Earth as Suraman (Christopher Lee), under the eye of Sauren, continues building an orc army that will be used to rise up against the powers that oppose Mordor.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhyse-Davies) are in pursuit of thier captured counterparts,  Merry(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin(Billy Boyd), two hobbits who ventured out by chance with Frodo and Sam in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
As with the novel by the same title ""The Two Towers"" expands the realm of Middle Earth, and introduces us to many new characters, including the beautiful Eowen (Miranda Otto), daughter to King Theoden, who finds herself falling for the mysterious Aragorn when he helps free her father from the manipulations of Sauren.
The special extended edition of this film, like its ""Fellowship"" counterpart, does a marvelous job of expanding scenes, further developing characters and situations, providing an ever more expansive film that fans of this series are sure to treasure.  The 4-DVD set contains two additional CD's which contains a treasure trove of extras, including expansive looks into the creation of the CG characters seen in the film, focusing on the development of Gollum from storyboard to a ""living, breathing crature"" on the screen.  The extras discuss many of the aspects, decisions and ideas that Peter Jackson brought with him at the onset of developing this epic film series.
This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who has been fortunate enough to experience any part of this major epic movie series. These films go far and beyond any undertaking of this magnitude thus far and the results are films of such quality that they will forever raise the bar for filmmakers in the future.  Make this collection a part of your DVD library.  If these films continue to achieve the acclaim that Tolkien's original ""Ring"" series has maintained in the literary world, than these films promise to entertain for generations to come, providing a canvas which contains some of the most beautiful, elaborate and indeed, complex cinematography ever seen.

1457186,4,B00005JKZU,"i absolutely HATE the fact that both extended LOTR editions split up the movie on two discs. That's absolutely absurd. The Gladiator DVD has TONs of material on both discs, so the technology is definitely there. DVD's can hold way more than 3.5 hours that the movie is. Other than that annoying trait that's obviously not going to change (because they can charge more for 4-discs than 2), this is a great edition that fills in a few more blanks that the theatrical version had to have to fit into studio preferred time limits.",1072656000,,526,4.6063829787234045

1457188,5,B00005JKZU,"I decided to hold off reviewing this beloved epic until I have seen it in its entirety and now that I have I confidently and enthusiastically cry out a big WOW for the most impressive epic film ever made.
Every single aspect of this film is infused with Peter Jackson's (director) ingenious and exquisite vision. The colossal production is very evident throughout the trilogy and the mesmerizing special effects are exactly that ... mesmerizing. Filming this epic in one shot was perhaps the most brilliant idea Peter Jackson had for this film. Over the past three years, every December fans take off from where we left off the previous year without feeling a discrepancy here or there in the characters, the landscape or pace. It's as if we were suspended in the no-time zone for a year after year ready to experience the magic of the Ring.
The ensemble cast is magnificent as well. I cannot pick favorites (even though I loved Sam Gamgee) for that every single actor did an outstanding job depicting his/her character and together they played an ethereal symphony Beethovenian in caliber. J. R. R. Tolkien's characters represented the full gamut of human nature and Peter Jackson was able to recreate that on the screen with stark detail. From the peace-loving, innocent hobbits to the evil and sinister Orcs lies the perpetually confused, unpredictable man. The epic in a way represents the microcosm of life: a perpetually peculiar battle between perceived good and perceived evil.
Fall from grace, confusion, dilemmas, hard decisions, community strength, courage and triumph are some of the many underlying themes of this universally adored work of art. Some people have dismissed this film as a ""fantasy flick"", but in reality it is an epic with an incredible impact like that of Ben Hur's, Spartacus' and Gladiator's combined!
This film is one of my all time favorites and I do recommend it to all.",1072656000,4,1905,4.937694704049845
1457189,5,B00005JKZU,"I really enjoyed watching the extended version of the film because it really ties up all the loose ends that the theatrical version leaves blank.  With over 40 minutes of extra footage there is plenty of material to mention.  Although I am still disappointed by the major alterations Jackson made to Faramir's character and Frodo and Sam's quest, the extra scene showing the complex relationship between Boromir, Faramir, and Denethor is excellent and really sets a nice backdrop for the third installment.  The extended version also contains one of my favorite scenes from the Tolkien trilogy where Merry and Pippin drink the water in Fangorn forest and grow taller.  Another scene of interest is the one where Aragorn and Eowyn discuss Aragorn's true age and his association with the previous king of Rohan.  The theatrical release of the Two Towers was truly epic, but the extended version builds upon the epic nature of the movie and also includes a lot of material that makes sense of the storyline for those who haven't read the trilogy.",1072656000,4,1043,4.937142857142857

I stated in the review that ""Tolkein was instumental in Lewis' conversion back to Christianity"".  Clearly, to convert back to something, one has to be away from it previously.  Anyway, the DVD does not put Mr. Duriez' statement in context and it leaves the impression that Lewis was simply an atheist.

I am not putting 5 stars because of all the hard work Peter Jackson did or anyone else for that matter. This gets 5 stars from me because I enjoyed it immensely.

1457275,2,B00005JKZU,"I read these books as a teen 20 years ago, and when I saw the movies coming out I was very excited, so I read the books again to prepare.  The Fellowship of the Ring was fairly true to the book save some Aragorn/Arwen stuff, so I was very pleased with the first installment and fired up for The Two Towers.  I just rented the DVD and it was a huge disappointment.
I am no Tolkien geek or anything, but I fail to see the need for all the plot changes.  If you knew nothing of the books I think these movies would be hideously boring. For example, you can barely understand a word Treebeard says.  If you hadn't read the book you would not be able to follow what the heck he is even talking about (would you know what an ""entmoot"" is? Of course not).  All the other plots and characters would be impossible to follow as well.  So that leaves the people who read the books to be most of the paying customers seeing the movie over and over again.  So why not just keep the plot the same?  As I watched it I kept saying WHAT?  I don't remember a Warg battle on the way to Helm's deep.  I don't remember Aragorn falling over a cliff.  I don't remember Elves showing up at Helm's Deep.  I don't remember an orc chasing Merry and Pippin into Fangorn and Treebeard saving them.  I don't remember all the endless Arwen scenes that are totally pointless.  I don't remember a martial-arts style fight in the Golden Hall.  Most of all, the total 180 degree treatment of the Faramir chapter is unbelievable!  I was totally disgusted at that point.
I am disappointed to read all these rave reviews by people.  I was hoping true Tolkien fans would be ready to revolt, but it seems that no one cares.  If the books are so boring that you have to liven up the plots by making all these MAJOR changes, then why are they timeless classics read by millions, and will probably go down as some of the most popular books in the history of literature?  I am sure Peter Jackson could care less, and in the end he was probably right anyway, judging by the $$$ the films have grossed.  But I still think he could have made just as much without butchering the story. I was really excited to see this movie, but now I do not even know if I want to see Return of the King.  What's the point?  It's not the same story.",1072483200,7,2286,4.206896551724138
1457276,5,B00005JKZU,"When ""Fellowship of the Ring's"" extended edition came out it was every Tolkien fan's and fantasy lover's dream. The added minutes might not have worked in the cinema (where countless people don't want to know every detail about hobbits and their everyday life), but they certainly helped to flesh out the story even more.
And now ""The Two Towers"" extended edition, the most waited DVD of 2003, is finally out with an amazing 40 additional minutes that you can only love. In the first cut of ""The Two Towers"" it seemed that during the first half Jackson didn't dear or want to give Gollum long moments to speaks and act. Well, guess what? The first extended scene involves a short monologue that foreshadows some of the greatest inner battles in cinema's history.
Then more brutality is given to the orcs and finding of Theoden's son is shown. Definitely the best extended scenes involve Faramir and Eowyn. Miranda Otto shows us that she can sing as well as act with a heart-wrenching dirge sung at Theodred's funeral. The added scenes also add to the relationship between Eowyn and Aragorn (as well as some funny moments). Faramir, whose character has been changed the most from his bookform, is given more screen time in flashback/dream sequences that also feature Boromir who was killed during the final confrontation of the first movie. The added scenes help us to understan the difficult relations between the two brothers and their father, the Steward of Gondor.
And to top the cake with a cherry, almost 10 minutes have been added to the end of the movie. Showing the aftermath of Helm's Deep battle (the revenge of Huorns) and an extended destruction of Isengaard. Plus, of course, the scene where Merry and Pippin find the food and pipeweed cellars of Saruman.
The rest of the discs continue the Rings tradition of offering a breathtaking array of information about the making of the movies, choosing the actors, creating the effects, and staying true to the books. One of the best behind-the-scenes looks of all time.
I have to say that I have been a Tolkien fan since childhood but I also must confess that I enjoy Jackson's movies even more than the original books. To me the extended editions are the best Christmas gift and I sure hope that some years from now XXL-deluxe-editions will be released where every movie is 5 hours long.
Overall, it is understandable why the added scenes were left out from the theatrical cut, but they sure do make the movie even better. This DVD is a must-buy!",1072396800,9,2504,4.771889400921659

1457278,5,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably the best film trilogy ever. I mean just think about it. All other film trilogies fall apart on the second or third film. The Godfather trilogy was good with the exception of part III. And lets face it, Return of the Jedi wasn't the best movie either. The Matrix 2 and 3 sucked. I could go on and on. But the Lord of the Rings movies are all awesome and each, in my opinion, are worthy of Best movie from the oscars.
Here are my opinions on each film.
FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING: this actually is probably my favorite of the three movies. I personally think this one has the most sense of actual fantasy and adventure. I love how it starts out so peaceful in the shire and ends so gloomy and depressing at Amon Hen. This film also has the most moments where it lets you watch in awe at all the amazing environments. It got 13 nominations at the academy awards. Is that not awesome?? My favorite scene in the whole trilogy is the treck through Moria. This is a great movie!!! 10/10
TWO TOWERS: This is probably my least favorite of the three. There is so much talking and its kinda boring until the battle of Helms Deep. This film strays the farthest from the books. I mean come on! Frodo never sets foot in Osgiliath in the whole trilogy! The extended version is very good and i personally they should have left the Boromir and Faramir scene in the original cut. This is still a great movie. 8/10
RETURN OF THE KING: This was an awesome movie!!!!!!!! Gollum is my favorite character and I think it was awesomely portrayed. The Pelennor fields scene was awesome! Shelobs lair was aesome! The battle of the black gate was awesome!  This movie was awesome! 9/10

""The Two Towers"" delivers in action, emotional impact, scoring, direction, characterization, and brilliant performances (Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Christopher Lee, Sean Astin, and Bernard Hill, standouts among a stellar ensemble) should be the standard for epics to come.  This is obvious by the praise from professional and laymen reviewers alike.
The only ""downside"" is this film's lack of occasional levity.  Based on the ""serious"" nature of Tolkein's masterpiece and Jackson's desire to be as faithful as possible, humor doesn't quite fit.
However, an induced smile would be welcome amongst the opulent battle sequences, the sweeping set pieces, the mystical fairy scenes, and the Hobbits in transit.

So, as the opening of the first LOTR film got closer and closer, I was really starting to wonder.  See, I knew that, comparing this to STAR WARS, that the fantasy genre would go nowhere in movies if LOTR bombed.
Fortunately, I was wrong about Jackson and the quality of the movie, so, I am gladly eating my hat.
FELLOWSHIP begins the tale of the struggle between good and evil in which the Evil Lord's ring, which is imbued with a great deal of his essence, is lost after good wins.  Through a series of incidents Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, inherits the ring, but finds out that it must be destroyed or the world will end in fire.
The extended version includes extra footages like: (1) more fight scenes with the Uruk Hai; (2) a scene of Merry and Pippin dancing; (3) additional Shire material in the beginning; (4) more with the fight at Moria; (5) a bit more travel time and sequences at Rivendell; and (6) more backstory about Gollum.
But, the true treasure of this four CD set lies in the commentary of the creative team:
(1) Did you know that Galadriel is a great aunt to Arwen?  So, when she talks to Aragorn about his relationship with her, it's more of a big deal than we think;
(2) There's lots about the makeup of the hobbits and especially the hours spent on the feet and makeup;
(3) Details of how the orcs and other fantastic creatures were made; especially about the rock troll;
(4) Did you know that some of the people passing by the hobbits at the PRANCING PONY were acrobatic women on stilts?;
(5) How many times they rewrote the prelude which introduced Sauron;
(6) The makeup and design of Rivendell; why it was set with nature and many open causeways to the elements;
(7) How the director got some of the most famous artists, who did renditions of Tolkien, to work on the set;
(8) How the cast was chosen;
(9) It goes through the whole movie with commentary by the director and writers; and then another run through with commentary by the actors;
(10) Why the prologue with the battle against Sauron kept being taken out and then being put back in;
(11) How the director told Ian McKellan (i.e. Gandalf) to compare Frodo volunteering to taking the ring to having a son who just volunteered to fight in the WWI trenches.;
(12) How Sean Astin hurt his foot;
(13) The CGI and how it helped plot the story;
(14) Dwarf tossing remarks;
(15) The design of the Balrog;
(16) Why Tom Bombadil didn't make it in the movie;
(17) How the director and writers had to deal with the producers and studios to accomplish certain feats (i.e. like letting Gandalf smoke!)
Overall, a smashing success.

1457351,5,B00005JKZU,"I love this movie.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  And with the adding of some humor and the 43 minutes of extra scenes, you can't get much better!",1071964800,2,156,4.0
1457352,5,B00005JKZU,"After seeing the extended ""Fellowship"" I was incredibly eager to see the extended ""Two Towers.""  Again, I was far from disappointed.
""The Two Towers"" is NOT the same kind of movie as ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  It's slower moving, more thought-provoking, and doesn't flow quite the same way.  Nevertheless, it is a fantasic film, and there is a lot of good to say about it.
The added scenes did little to dispel the somewhat disjointed quality of the movie, but it helped you to understand things a little better.  The Fellowship itself has broken up, and consequently it jumps back and forth between parties a little bit -- entirely understandable.  We track Frodo and Sam, Aragorn (with Legolas and Gimli at his side), Gandalf, and Merry and Pippin.  That's a lot of stories to keep track of!
But there is wonderful footage of all of it!
One of my personal favorite things is when they go back in time to Gondor when Boromir first went to join the Fellowship.  In the original release, we never saw Boromir at all, only his brother Faramir.  This flashback provides a little bit of insight into the people of Gondor, and we understand the character of Faramir a little better.
Also, when the Ents take Isengard, this new extended version adds the Forest of Fangorn attacking the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep!  I was so glad they put that back into the film!  Huzzah!
And the effect of Treebeard himself was incredible as well.  Some critics complained that he was so unconvincing, but I ask you -- if a tree got up and walked and talked, what do YOU think it would look like?!  The Ents were fantastic.
One of the best characters in this second film is obviously Smeagol/Gollum.  Talk about complete genius!  This CG character was phenomenal, I have never seen anything so totally convincing.  Understanding that particular character is SO integral to the story!  He was amazing to watch.
And, of course, the extras in this DVD are terrific as well.  It's worth getting the extended version just to watch those!
Now, I can't wait until the THIRD one comes out!  ;-)",1071792000,,2061,4.677777777777778
1457353,3,B00005JKZU,"I loved the Fellowship of the Ring.  The Two Towers has the every bit, the same high-level attention to detail as it's predecessor.
However, when I saw The Two Towers in the theatre last year, I found myself not enjoying it nearly as much as I did The Fellowship.  Now, after viewing the extended DVD, I think I know why.  The Two Towers just doesn't really go anywhere.  This, of course, is mostly due to it being the middle movie.  Don't get me wrong, the events that occur in The Two Towers are significant to the overall story.  It's just not a story in itself.  There is no beginning, that was the Fellowship.  There are only a few new characters (Eowyn, Treebeard, Eomer, and Theoden, for the most part).  The overall story of Frodo's quest only advances a tiny bit.  Basically, most of the Two Towers is a setup for the battle against Saruman's Orcs in Helm's Deep.  Again, I realize this is important to the overall story, but unfortunately, it's not enough.
The Fellowship of the Ring works as both a part of a trilogy and as a stand-alone film.  The Two Towers can't be looked at this way, it only works as the middle story of a trilogy.  That's fine and actually, unavoidable.  But it just doesn't come across as satisfying.",1071792000,5,1235,4.479820627802691
1457422,5,B00005JKZU,"Perhaps the storyline of Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers"" doesn't follow Tolkien's book as closely as some people would like, but I feel otherwise.  It's true that I miss certain characters, such as the Ent called Quickbeam, but to me, capturing the story of the Two Towers is not about showing every miniscule detail.  To be sure, some details are important, as shown in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" when Sam Gamgee claps Frodo's hand in Rivendell.  The most important thing, though, is to stay true to the themes that Tolkien wove into his work, and in that I think Mr. Jackson has done admirably.  And, of course, the information displayed in the appendices are a treasure to lovers of film-making, such as myself.
Mr. Jackson, thank you for this amazing piece of cinematic art.",1071792000,5,781,4.762962962962963
1457423,5,B00005JKZU,"First, let me say that I have not read the books -- and I don't really intend to.  I'm not a real fan of the whole fantasy/sci-fi genre, so I tend to have little patience for complaints that such-and-such minor character, who was in the book, didn't appear in the film.  I just don't care.
However, I do like good movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Two Towers in the theater.  However, I always had the feeling that I just didn't get some parts of the plot: for example, what's with Gandalf the Grey becoming Gandalf the White?  Not to mention all the non-sensical names for everything, I found it pretty hard to keep all the names for all the characters and locations straight in my head, what with all the plot twists and so forth.
As a result, as much as I loved the spectacle of the LOTR films, I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching the first movie filmed entirely in the fictional language of Klingon.
That being said, the additional material in the Extended Edition of the Two Towers really helped me to better grasp various plot points and character motivations, making the movie a much fuller, enriching experience.  It still will not drive me to go out and read the books, but it makes a very good movie even better. Yes, it is long, but the additional forty-odd minutes of material are worth it.

This is a comprehensive journey into the WETA workshop, production phases and audio commentaries from the crew itself. Fans will enjoy the snippets of how Gollum is brought to life by Andy Serkis and the creation of Fangorn Forest and Rohan. The Two Towers is an exhilarating fantasia that marks the heart of the classic trilogy with interwoven themes of friendship, loyalty and love.

1457426,5,B00005JKZU,"This is definitely the version of the film that you want to see. With over 40 minutes of extra footage, this version of Peter Jackson's Academy Award Winning film is deeper and fuller and closer to the book. Although Tolkien purists do not care for the changes Jackson made to Frodo's story line and the character of Faramir, Jackson otherwise captures the spirit of Tolkien's second part to The Lord of the Rings. Among the extra scenes are: a sequence with Merry and Pippin which draws from ""Old Man Willow"" in book of Fellowship of the Ring; a very helpful and interesting conversation between Gandalf and Aragorn about Aragorn's destiny; more of Frodo and Sam; more of Treebeard and the Ents (including their attack on the orcs in Fangorn Forest); and the delightful chapter from the book, ""Flotsam and Jetsam."" There are also HOURS of documentary material which show just how much work it really took to produce such a great film.",1071705600,7,935,4.777777777777778
1457427,5,B00005JKZU,"Like the Extended Edition for ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", this Extended Edition expands upon the version of ""The Two Towers"" that was presented in the theaters.  There is approximately 40 minutes of additional material woven back into the movie.  The most important (and the most effective) additional scenes are the ones that involve Faramir.  One of the complaints some people had about ""The Two Towers"" was that in the book Faramir was pure of heart and was not tempted by the ring at all.  In the movie, his character was changed so that he was a real threat to Frodo's journey.  Faramir's additional scenes explain his motivation towards the Ring and why he behaves the way he does.  There are also flashbacks with Boromir, more scenes with the Ents, and the additional scenes make for a richer Lord of the Rings experience.
There are also two discs of bonus material to supplement the film.  Some of these bonus documentaries are very similar to those from the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" DVD.  The similar documentaries have material specific to ""The Two Towers"", but it covers the same topics as those from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  Examples of these documentaries are the ones on ""Weta Workshop"", ""Bigatures"", and ""The Atlas of Middle Earth"".  There are also documentaries that are completely new.  One of my favorites is the documentary about adapting the book into a screenplay.  This documentary showed how Peter Jackson had to make decisions about what to include in the film, what scenes and characters to cut, and why certain changes had to be made (Jackson gives a very good explanation for Faramir's change).  The other major documentary was about Gollum.  Gollum was a character on whom the success of the entire series hinged.  If he was poorly animated or wasn't believable, ""The Two Towers"" would ultimately fail as a film (and this would also bring down ""The Return of the King"").  The Gollum documentary shows how Gollum was created, and exactly how much work went into making the character look so well on the screen.  It also shows just how important Andy Serkis was in creating the character.  He was a lot more than a voice actor, he was the character actor for Gollum.
Just as the Extended Cut of ""Fellowship"" was essential viewing for fans of Lord of the Rings, so is the Extended Cut of ""The Two Towers"".  While these additional scenes didn't complete the film in the way that those from ""Fellowship"" did, they do make ""The Two Towers"" a better movie.",1071705600,6,2485,4.77751756440281
1457428,5,B00005JKZU,"I have been a fan of Tolkien for many years, and have read and re-read the Hobbit, Fellowship,Two Towers, & Return of the King many times over.  I've yet to tire of these wonderful books.
When I heard about the triology of L.O.R. books being put to film, I was excited, but skeptical that anyone could do justice to the books that I love so much....
I was wrong.  What Peter Jackson and crew have done with these films is astounding!  Not only because of the fact that the characters are living and breathing on screen, and the imagined sites of both paradise & hell are made real, but most of all, because the bitter and sweet essences of good and evil are exquisitely portrayed by the fine cast, not to mention the heart-wrenchingly beautiful soundtracks by Howard Shore which stand on their own as very fine pieces of musical art.
You MUST see the extended versions of both Fellowship and Two Towers...there has not been a set of films like this in my lifetime, and I doubt there will be any to top them in the future....",1071532800,4,1024,4.4361702127659575
1457429,5,B00005JKZU,"I finally got around to watching this and I'll have to say that it was worth the wait.  The movie is pretty hefty to watch in one sitting, as it is close to 4 hours long, but it doesn't seem like a 4 hour movie.  The added scenes seem to make the pace of the movie a little better and they definately fill in the holes that the Theatrical version had.
It is definately a middle piece in the tradition of Empire Strikes Back in that it ends on a somewhat up but down note.  Part of the bad guys vanquished, but there is still the task ahead.  Frodo seems to grow into his role as the ring bearer and Samwise is the support mechanism.  Not sure about the stuff with the Ents, but it was still pretty cool nonetheless.  The Elves coming to support Helms Deep was pretty cool because it was looking pretty grim at that point.  The battle scenes that followed were some of the coolest battle scenes put to celluoid.
Everything seems to be gearing up to the Return of the King and more stuff was added to this movie leaving no doubt who that would be.
As I said in my review of the other Rings movie, I wish more filmmakers would take lessons from Mr. Jackson.  He's raised the bar on fantasy movies in that it doesn't have to be bad.  He's also raised the bar on CGI characters in that they don't have to be annoying.  Gollum was just as real as any of the other characters.  This movie has raised the bar on other movies as well.
I haven't see the Return of the King movie, but since it is the conclusion of the series and if it is as good as the other two, it should win the Oscar for Best Picture.  In fact, the Oscar should be for the entire 9 hour effort because the whole triology is a movie in its own right.  With all the subpar stuff coming out of Hollywood, it is refreshing to see a good movie come out.",1071446400,2,1809,4.090651558073654
1457430,5,B00005JKZU,"I was pleased with the theatrical version of ""The Two Towers,"" but found it inferior to ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" still the greatest fantasy film ever made (though ""Return of the King"" may top it). Peter Jackson's brilliant expanded edition, part of yet another 4-disc DVD set that continues to redefine home video, has increased my understanding of the storyline and given a big boost to my respect for this second installment.
This extended version is marvelous, one of the great films, truly a rival for the crown currently worn by ""Fellowship."" The characters are deeper, richer, the story meatier, the relationships better developed, and the build-up to the battle of Helm's Deep longer and more effective. I always felt the theatrical version of ""Two Towers"" was a bit of a choppy mess, hurling us from one locale to another without the over-arcing grace and feeling evident in the first film. Jackson has restored that sense of majestic pacing in the extended version, which I heartily recommend over the original release.
""The Lord of the Rings"" cinematic trilogy is without doubt the most important film series of our time. Jackson has far surpassed even the earlier works of Lucas and Spielberg in bringing Tolkien's wonderful literary artwork to the screen. Having just digested the new version of ""Two Towers,"" it's obvious to me that the books and the films are equals. Jackson did take some liberties, particularly in ""Two Towers,"" with some of the characters, but in adapting such a difficult book for the screen, he deserves major credit for what he has achieved. Why neither of these magnificent films has won the Best Picture Oscar is beyond reasoning, but ""Return of the King"" might at last take home the prize.
Jackson emphasizes story over razzle-dazzle, though the computer-generated effects in ""Towers"" and ""Fellowship"" are miles beyond anything I've ever seen. There isn't anything in ""Towers"" that quite rivals the Balrog sequence in the first film, but Jackson's staging of the battle of Helm's Deep, the Ent attack, and his overall vision of Middle-earth continue to boggle the mind.
We are also treated to some memorable performances from a low-key, expert cast. I have only a few minor complaints about ""Two Towers,"" chiefly that we don't get enough of Gandalf, whose presence elevates the series into the realm of the sublime. Though Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and others deliver strong performances, the movie all but belongs to Andy Serkis, who (along with various software programs) plays the unforgettable Gollum. George Lucas really dropped the ball with ""Star Wars"" by inflicting us with such dreadful acting. Jackson doesn't make the same mistake.
""The Two Towers"" is vastly improved by the additional scenes restored to the new DVD release and stands as a powerful middle-section in a series that will doubtless become a landmark achievement, bigger than ""Star Wars,"" way bigger than ""Indiana Jones."" The extended version does a great job setting us up for ""Return of the King,"" which opens just a couple of days from now. I'm excited to see it on the big screen, but can't wait until next year, when it gets the deluxe DVD treatment. Now that will be more valuable than any One Ring you could imagine.",1071446400,7,3303,5.007272727272727

Yet, after watching this new extended version, i must confess i will stick to the original.
4 hours long....my gosh.  If you're thirsty for everything you can get before you see Return of the King, then by all means, get this version. It has some excellent developments to the story that do make it richer.
But unfortunately most of the material in these new scenes is already inferred in the original version, and it tends to dumb down the original's effectiveness and pace by adding too much detail to an already elaborate tale. 43 minutes worth no less! And a lot of it is purely humorous and witty, which numbs the emotional power of this movie notably.
In any case, regardless of any negative review, i would have seen this version, and so should you. But you should accept the original as the truer, most powerful version of this epic story.

Also, many of the extra scenes are humorous, but they don't fit in the overall somber mood of the movie - such as when Pippin and Merry discover all the food and tobacco that Saruman is hoarding in Isengard.  One scene that should not have been deleted is a scene in Osgiliath (a flashback), involving Faramir, Boromir and their father.

1457510,2,B00005JKZU,"These movies are a rape of the books of Tolkien in so many ways that a book could be written about that alone. It no more resembles his works than Armageddon resembles Nasa's space program.
As for specifics: The characters in this movie don't even resemble Tolkien's in far too many cases. Scene after scene of places and events that weren't in the books and bad dialog writing not worthy of an Oxford scholar.
Christopher Tolkien in his wisdom said that he didn't believe that his father's books could or should lend themselves to be made into film. I heartily agree. Not with the film making of today. The visual effects may be up to par worthy of the scenes in the books but as long as there are writers and directors that don't care about the author's intent what's the point?
I don't understand why these directors, producers and writers have to dumb down a classic book for the masses. Especially since they have been so widely read. Were the millions who read the books too stupid to understand them so that Peter Jackson has to use cliche and exposition, not to mention characters and incidents that were not even in any of the three volumes, to explain to the dullards what is happening?
And to the reviewer from Canada-just because millions of people have loved these movies doesn't make them any better, just as millions of people that listen and love Britney Spears doesn't elevate that to art. Instead of trying to teach illiterates about books through movies how about teaching them to read and not be force fed crap. But I guess that is the socialist's way of doing things. Don't attack the real root of the problem, just dumb everything down for the masses. After all they are just sheep.

The Two Towers does it seamlessly, and does it well!  The additional scenes looked like they should be there and I wish most had been there in the theatrical version - I don't think I can watch the shorter version again.  The extended version is that much better!
I have not read the books (blasphemy, I know!), so I felt like the additional scenes really made the movie come together more, and explained to me why certain characters act the way they do.  One particular scene is where Aragorn sets the horse free in the stable, then that same horse later comes to save him.  In the theatrical version, I was left wondering why this random horse saved his life - the extended version answered that question for me.  There are many other added scenes, including more with the Ents/Merry/Pippin, some more with Arwen and her father, more of Faramir and a great scene where Eomer finds Theoden's dying son after a battle with orcs.
I haven't gotten a chance to view many of the extras on the DVD set yet, but what I have seen so far is excellent!  My favorite extra so far is the stuff with Gollum and Andy Serkis - which I find fascinating!  Plus, there is a cute Gollum 'easter egg' which I'll not reveal here - but it's worth checking out.  I also listened to a bit of the director's commentary, and can't wait to hear the entire thing.
This set is great, well worth the cost.  So far, between the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, Peter Jackson is on his way to making one of the best trilogies of all time (in my humble opinion, of course).",1071187200,6,1676,4.377419354838709
1457513,5,B00005JKZU,"How enjoyable it is to see excellent literature made into an excellent movie. I have to say that when I first heard that Peter Jackson was taking on this project my first thoughts were that he had bitten off more than he could chew. Yet he continues to amaze me. I for one like Peter's interpretation of the books and have overwhelmingly approved of his direction in the films. Most of the reviewers I have read who do nothing but complain about the films are very unrealistic and have no concept of what it takes to make a movie from a book. What Tolkien could describe to the imagination of the reader with a sentence or two a movie might need half an hour to do it properly. When viewing a movie such as this it must be understood that certain elements of the book must be sacrificed for the sake of continuity in the film. To generalize movie making as the same as writing a book is hopelessly naive.
With that said this DVD provides a much more complete version of the story. Several welcome additions were present in this DVD that fill in the rough spots quite nicely. The extended sequences with the Ents in particular comes to mind. I especially was pleased to see that Merry and Pippin growing taller from the Ent water was in the film too.
The picture and sound quality of the DVD are crisp and clean. I have not yet explored all the bonus material so for that I cannot comment. All in all this movie is an great take on a classic work of fiction and should be owned by any Tolkien fan.",1071187200,10,1496,4.308510638297872
1457514,5,B00005JKZU,"While the extra footage in the extended edition of FOTR was nice, particularly the additional Shire footage and the gifts of Galadriel (I'm still not sure how they could justify cutting THAT section), I was left with the feeling that while it was nice to see, it didn't add that much value over the theatrical version.  Consequently, after multiple viewings of the theatrical version, I was not certain that TTT could be improved by adding additional footage.  I am happy to say that I was dead wrong.
Not only does the additional footage add some nice back stories that help the viewer to clarify motive (e.g., Faramir's stormy relationship with Denethor), it makes the overall fabric of the movie richer.  Tolkein purists may quibble over the artistic license that Peter Jackson has taken on certain plot points and characters, but in my opinion, most of the changes he has made were necessary to translate the books to film.  I had trouble getting through the book TTT because of the way the story was subdivided.
For example, Jackson wisely distills Merry and Pippin's time with the Ents into a few key scenes that last far too many pages in Tolkein's novel.  Jackson also wisely minimizes the time we see Frodo and Sam crawling through rocky outcroppings and walking across the countryside.  For a visual medium, hobbits walking through a forest or crawling up a mountain are just not that interesting.  Instead, Jackson invests a significant amount of time where it belongs, with Aragorn at Helm's Deep, thus setting up the final film nicely.
Since this review is being written before the release of ROTK, I can only say that I hope the final installment is as good as the first two, and I cannot wait to completely the DVD trilogy with both the theatrical and extended editions of ROTK.  These are movies that can be watched time and again and never become tiresome.  I do not mean to sound like a raving fanboy for the LOTR trilogy, but I am very glad that Peter Jackson and New Line took the time to do the films and the DVDs properly!",1071187200,7,2044,4.687150837988827
1457515,5,B00005JKZU,"The added scenes do make it better, yes.
 We get a bit more fleshing out of newer characters, such as Eowyn, in an uncharacteristic scene (so says PJ in the commentary, and I agree) which serves the purpose of revealing Aragorn's age of 87, we get more of Faramir with a compassionate monologue over the body of the dead Oliophaunt rider, an introduction to Denethor, and a blink more Eomer as he searches for Theoden's son in a butchered heap of Rohan and Orcish soldiers.
As far as older characters: we see a splash more dialogue from Arwen, more tortured, unloved Gollum scenes (now, more people are mean to him), the beloved Ent-draught scenes where Pippin and Merry grow, and their raiding of Saruman's food and tobacco stash in Isengard.
The pluses of the extended scenes in The Two Towers is that, unlike in the Fellowship where the Tolkien-familiar viewer gets more of his/her favorite scenes, this version of TTT is fuller in feel, are a little more congruent, and the new-to-Tolkien viewer feels more prepared to go into the next part of the story in the following movie, i.e., The Return of the King.
While I still feel that Faramir's ""uncertain if he's a hero"" role was a bit redundant in the theatrical release, his aiding Frodo at the end and redeeming himself by showing his true heroic quality is necessary viewing in preparing for ROTK, even if PJ changes the story around.
As reluctant as I am to admit it, Jackson's changes (with the exception of the Eowyn soup-making extended scene) work very well to make a compact (9 hours IS very hard to do justice to Tolkien's Masterpiece), true-to-feel piece of cinema, as well as a coherent, satisfying movie chopped into three large chunks.
Can't wait for the third part!! T-minus.....
Oh, and did I mention the HILARIOUS Easter Egg (sad too few of these. What, ONE? c'mon...) of Gollum's acceptance speech at the MTV movie awards!
As always, all the WETA workshop/behind the scenes features are always very satisfying to watch. Just time consuming. I recommend dedicating an entire day/evening to them.",1071100800,7,2065,4.800561797752809
1457516,5,B00005JKZU,"The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.
The disk 3 and 4 extras (which worked perfectly, BTW) are also a real treat.  The section on Gollum and Andy Serkis alone is worth the extra money.
So, just like with the ""Fellowship"" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of ""King"" next year.",1071100800,,1065,4.718918918918919
1457517,5,B00005JKZU,"I've been reading the books once a year for the last 30+ years. It's a beloved classic and I never thought it could be translated into a movie, though I loved the idea. My first viewing of The Two Towers gave me a bit of a 'turn' - I had a couple of surreal moments - when Aragorn went over the cliff. How could I have been reading these books for all these years and missed THAT!?? The answer that flashed back was easy - it never happened - okaaay - the first movie was wonderful - trust Peter and let it slide. One of my favorite passages in the second book was Sam and Frodo's time in Ithilien and I was waiting to see Faramir, and there he was and ....Who the Hell IS that!?  I was a bit miffed at the change in my favorite Ithilien ranger Faramir's character. However on the way to the car I realized that I understood why the changes were made. This extended DVD seems to flesh out the changes and I think that if I had seen this extended version first the changes would not have been so distracting, though I enjoyed the theatrical version, once I got over the changes. The movie still captured the flavor of Tolkeins work. This is a wonderful version of the Two Towers and I would recommend watching the movie with the director and writers commentary after viewing the 'original', particularly if you don't understand the changes (even if you do - it validates your understanding). It does give you a deeper/better insight into why the changes had to happen.
My only complaint is that my DVD player doesn't play the 2 appendices discs, and no one can tell me why. My Zenith DVD is new and plays DVD, CDr, CDRW and MP3s, though it's coded as region 1. It seems odd that I can view the first 2 discs and not the 3rd and 4th. (I had them back to the store where I bought the DVD's and all the discs play on the store's set up)I did not purchase the Two Towers through Amazon as I did the first and will do for the 3rd, so I'm not sure if there would be the same problem. If anyone has any helpful information regarding this I would be very grateful. It's so frustrating not to be able to view them. For me seeing the creative efforts that went into the making of these films is a wonderful experience.",1071100800,3,2207,4.217494089834515
1457605,5,B00005JKZU,"After seeing FOTR, I highly anticipated the release of Two Towers.  While I thought the theatrical version was excellent, the extended version is FAR superior, not just drawn out scenes, etc...While attention to visual and audio detail was nearly flawless in this movie, there were a couple things I thought unneccessary.  Aragorn presumed dead is one change that was totally unneccessary because it did not add anything to the story.  Other changes like the differece in Faromir's character are, in my  opinion, well justified and plausable in the extended edition.  One thing I liked less about TT than Fellowship, was there was less character development.  That is no longer the case after watching the extended cut.  The movie was much darker than the Fellowship, as was the book, so I felt that the writers tried just a little to hard for laughs at times when the story was not meant to be funny...ie.  while Rohan men are dying on the way to Helm's Deep or during the battle itself.  I think the forced humor lessened the dark mood of the story, which may have been what they were trying to do, but I thought it was too much, and hope for less wisecracks in the middle of a battle to save the world, in ROTK.  That being said, Jackson and Co. are marvelous storytellers.  Many small changes added to the visual experience what the book could not.  The acting (and casting) was superior, and THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVIE AS VISUALLY STUNNING!  Due to the excellence of the fist two parts of the story, I am anticipating ROTK like no other movie...EVER!!!  As if this were not enough, the bonus discs were great.  I thought they might be recycled versions of the bonus material in Fellowship, but that was not the case at all.  This movie set is definitely the crown jewel of my movie collection...I would have pai twice what I did for it...it's that good!",1071014400,,1860,4.625

The only thing that's been bugging me about Two Towers is Arwen.  Now, if you've read all three of the books, you know that in Return of the King, Aragorn and Arwen get married.  I'm very worried about whether that's going to happen in the movie.  (Hey, what can I say, I'm a girl, I like a little bit of romance with my action).  Because they showed her in the movie walking with all the other elves to take the ship to Valinor.  But I've seen a couple previews for Return of the King and Arwen seems to be in it, so we'll see what happens.
I of course can't wait till Return of the King comes out, but for now, I'm satiated with the Extended version of Two Towers (I also have the extended version of Fellowship).  So once Return of the King comes out on the extended DVD, I'm going to have about a 12 hour Lord of the Rings movie marathon.
Once again, if you had trouble sitting through the 3-hour version and don't think you have the attention span for any more of it, then stick with the version that was released in theaters.  But if you actually have an attention span, go for the extended version.  There's some great stuff in it that isn't in the original version.  I haven't watched the two bonus disks yet, but if they're anything like the one's for Fellowship, I can probably do without seeing them.",1071014400,,1518,4.347517730496454

The various creatures and landscapes that occupy this movie are just fascinating. Everything is done on a massive scale. The action and battle scenes are worthy of a first class war movie, and the producers and director wisely decided to leave the violence of battle in the film.

The 43 minutes of extra footage is relevant and, often times, critical to the telling of the story-- especially in terms of explaining the departures Peter Jackson made from the books with the character of Faramir.
The cast commentary is good-- if it was possible to remove Sean Astin's film-school-freshman-pseudo-philosophical cranked up rambling, the cast commentary would be excellent.  Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan had me rolling with laughter during the commentary, bringing of fond memories of Mystery Science Theater... which more than made up for Astin.  I'd give a small fortune to see a Dom-and-Billy-only commentary on these films.  These guys are really, really funny.
The Director's commentary and the 2 disks of additional ""making of"" features are A+, and have provided hours of entertainment.  Without a doubt, these films have redefined what is possible in terms of film making-- made all the more apparent when the viewer is shown the level of detail the film makers went to in the making.

1457609,5,B00005JKZU,"If you are a fan of the books and hated this movie, you need to see this Extended Edition.  While I'm sure you can find more stuff to be mad about, the added scenes fix nearly all of my caveats about the movie as it was released to theaters.
The biggest thing they fixed was Faramir.  Instead of coming off as some lout who incomprehensibly lets the Ringbearer go in Osgiliath, you find him to be an intelligent, thoughtful man who is grieving for his beloved brother and trying to please a father who seems determined to hate him.  And it was a real pleasure to see Boromir (in a flashback) before the Ring started to eat at him.
The orc-cleaving contest between Gimli and Legolas becomes clearer.  There's more Frodo and Sam stuff.  You get to find out Aragorn's true age in an otherwise-uncomfortable scene.
The 4 audio tracks are a real joy also. From the writer/director's track, you learn that the movie did indeed suffer from middle-movie-itis; this is when everyone involved was suffering under the heaviest workloads.  You can tell that they're all cringing because they wanted to do it better... yet even what they did is so very good you want to comfort them.
My surprise favorite audio track this time was from the production and art people.  These are the folks who built and struck the sets every day, and who painted the backgrounds and made all the props and figured out how to light the sets.  They're the ones who made it all go!  And you can see that they loved this work enough to put in the hours and the labor and the true caring that makes it so wonderful to see.  Now, where can I find that elven furniture on EBay??
You'll have to look to another reviewer for the 2 supplimentary disks, I haven't seen them yet.  It will take you WEEKS to view everything on here.  I got the Collector's edition, and the documentary on the Gollum collectible was interesting, though it's also kind of a commercial for all the other collectible figures.

1457610,3,B00005JKZU,"Taken by itself, TTT is a wonderful movie with gorgous scenery and an incredible tale to tell.  It's a cinematic masterpiece by Peter Jackson, cast, and crew.  Unfortunately, it cannot be taken by itself - it must be compared to Tolkein's epic novel.
The main failing in this film is the warping of Faramir and the Ents from their depiction in Tokein's LOTR.  Tokein's work was at its core a classic battle of the outnumbered forces of good versus the powerful, merciless forces of evil.  The characters' motives are as important as their actions in showing their inner strength or weakness.  In Jackson's film, the final actions are the same, but the motives behind them are entirely different.
In the novel, Faramir resists the temptation to possess the ring from the beginning.  He doesn't require instruction in its peril to come to the right conclusion, he instinctively knows that seizing it would ruin him.  Jackson, however betrays his inner strength by causing him to initially succumb to a desire for power and approval before finally releasing the ringbearer.
In a like manner, the Ents are made to seem self-serving.  Tolkein portrays them as wise ancient beings who are slowly awakened to the treachery of Sauruman and his threat to all of Middle-Earth.  They act against him out of a desire not only to protect themselves and their trees, but also to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves in the defeat of evil.  Jackson eliminates their desire to help their fellow sentient creatures and shows them as merely grumpy old men who strike out at Sauruman after he messes up their back yard.
Both of these changes were unneccessary and betrayed the characters that Tolkein wrote.  This huge departure from Tolkein's vision marred an otherwise wonderful film.",1070928000,9,1758,4.925423728813559
1457611,5,B00005JKZU,"If you are reading this, then you must have at least a passing familiarity with the storyline, so I won't bore you by regurgitating widely known details. But I would like to focus on the extras. Most of the time, I think extras are pretty boring, and don't add much to the movie. But in this case, given the legendary reputation of the J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, a lot was at stake. Peter Jackson and company certainly did not dissapoint, and the extras are a testament to the staggering amount of work that went into this entire series, if you can even call it ""work."" The desire to remain truthful to Tolkien's vision is constantly reflected in the extras, especially the featurette on writing the script. I am currently rereading the series, and am often startled how much dialogue is taken directly from the books.
Other features include a look at the making of Gollum, as well as a demonstration of the computer programs used to create those massive armies (the program is appropriately titled ""Massive""). It's not only a fascinating look at special effects, but an interesting look at AI. There are also numerous other extensive documentaries covering sound, music and so forth. I had no idea that music was so difficult to implement.
My only complaint would be that the extras may be too extensive. There are 1000's of pictures, and I can't imagine too many people going through all of them. Also, four commentary tracks is a lot to slog through, especially considering how much information is on the 2 bonus discs.

It's a long movie and understandable why they cut it, it's a shame not to have given it to views in it's entirety as done here.

The films work, however, in SPITE of all that because enough of Tolkien's original story and characters shine through.

Understanding that the middle film in a trilogy is difficult to make in any situation (with the possible exception of The Empire Strikes Back), I still left the theater somewhat confused and let down after seeing The Two Towers. This was no doubt due, at least in part, to my feeling the film fell short of the excellence of The Fellowship. From my recollection of the books, it seemed that characters did not behave as they should, and at the end of the film were not where they were supposed to be.

The E.V. consists of 4 discs, 1-2 being the movie.  In the first disc, I thought that the extra scenes were simply used as humor devices to lighten the movie.  The first DVD, however, did not seem to contain as many significant added scenes than the second.  In the second disc, there were more influencial scenes in which I thought provided a clearer understanding to certain parts.  I will not go into detail, but to name a few, there was a scene where we understand more about who Faromir is his relationship to his father and brother, Boromir, who was part of the Fellowship.  There was a scene in which involved the trees playing a more significant role as to the outcome of the Battle of Helms Deep.  Already, I can not go on!  Take my word for it and see the E.V.  It will be well worth the time!
The two other discs that come with the movie are more features.  These features are very fun to browse through as it contains more interviews with people who helped make the movie and such.

Not having progressed past the Hobbit in my literary knowledge of the series, I'm continually surprised and impressed as the directors vision and execution and have since put the leather versions of the books on my wish list.  Frodo and Sam continue towards Mordor with the Ring while the rest of the band strike out on their own story arcs.  Truly epic in scope, they redefine the fantasy film genre.  It's amazing the difference in this trilogy between say, Matrix and Star Wars.  There is a gritty sense of realism which filming in NZ brings to the table, it seems so much less sterile than the almost completely CG world of the first three Star Wars films.  The magnificent battle for Helms Deep at the end is so much more emotionally compelling and visceral than the battle for Zion in Matrix 3 it's not even worth comparing, the former is so well done.  The extended DVDs are the ones that people should wait for adding a lot of missing footage it extends and fleshes out the original theatrical versions by 30-40 mins.  This trilogy deserves to take its place as one of if not the best of all time, combining the best of effects, storyline, acting, and presentation.  Highly recommended.",1070496000,2,1239,4.646788990825688

-LOTS of special additions that make the Merry/Pippin/Treebeard/ents scenes MUCH more satisfying
-the inexplicable Wargs scene is still there, but it seems diminished in importance in light of the other additions

1457863,2,B00005JKZU,"Well, as I suspected upon watching this in the theater, this movie reveals the lack of appreciation amongst the director and cast for Tolkien's books. At several places they mention how little they think about the way Tolkien developed this or that character or plot element. They completely misunderstand what Tolkien was saying about Faramir's character, and where they do retreat to an almost-Tolkienian love story between Aragorn and Arwen, they admit that this was after trying to make Arwen into a warrior and failing.
The movie is entertaining, and the casting, staging and effects are superb. It's just a shame they decided not to make Tolkien's story into a movie. This one is along the lines of ""inspired by"" fluff.",1070409600,8,725,5.0

1457865,5,B00005JKZU,"Once again, Peter Jackson and the rest of the team working on Lord of the Rings have stepped up and given us a stellar DVD package.
It's commonplace to pack extra features and interviews into DVD offerings these days, but to date, no one does it like Jackson.  Two full DVDs of insights into cast, crew, direction, production, post-production, etc, create a sprawling backstory to the excellent second film in the trilogy.
In addition, several new scenes have been added to the film, fleshing out the story and adding in quite a few aspects that I felt deserved to be in the film, as well as providing background for some of the choices the writers had to make in changing Tolkien's original story.
The two most significant of these, to me, are the flashback scene with Boromir that helps to soften the changes made in Faramir's character.  Jackson and writer Philippa Boyens point out, quite reasonably, that it is a little odd for the book-Faramir to throw off the voice of the ring, it being the most evil and corrupting influence in the entire world of Middle-Earth.  Their need to have Faramir be a barrier for Frodo drove them to rewrite his character, but the Theatrical release cut did not do justice to his reasoning.  The extended cut quite adequately fleshes this out.
I was thrilled to see that they added Treebeard sending the trees to Helm's Deep; I was disappointed to see that scene gone from theatrical release, and I think they did a stellar job of knitting it back in.  That scene also helped to smooth the jarring presence of the Elves in Helm's deep; a point that was a necessary alteration, but one that had many hard-core Tolikienites grumbling.
As with the previous Platinum Series DVD, the real meat of the release is the behind-the-scenes information.  Viewers get a continued insight into the massive scope of the production, including the breathtaking effort behind the building of Edoras and the subsequent removal of the sets.  Also with the introduction in the film of Gollum, there's a lot of Andy Serkis in the special features, and it's a real treat to see how this talented and charismatic actor did so well bringing gollum to life while filming, he caused changes in the design of the character in order to do him justice.
The DVD is too dense with goodies to give a comprehensive review; I've just gone over my personal highlights.  If you're a fan of the movies, this version is a must-have for your collection.",1070409600,5,2449,4.7189695550351285

The LOTR DVD collectors sets have to go down in the short history of DVD's as the greatest collection ever. Even for the casual, non-geeked out fan, this set is worth it for the extra forty minutes of cut scenes not shown in the movie version.  Watching the extended DVD will make the entire trilogy experience more satisfying.
Those who are fans of the book and obsessed with the movies will agree with me that the additional scenes bring the movie truer to the novel.
In the end, the additional 40 minutes and the four commentary tracks, not to mention the two additional dvds (mostly for the LOTR geeks like myself) are well worth the additional ten dollars over the single dvd version released in the summer of 2003.",1070323200,4,859,4.577922077922078

Of course, like the first collection of DVDs, they deal with the general problems and issues of turning the second book into the second movie.  The backgrounds, plot twists, special effects, weapons, languages, music, miniatures and accidents.

1457934,5,B00005JKZU,"My husband and I really enjoyed this version. I'm a big fan of the books and I was a little disappointed in the orignal theater version of the two towers because most of my favorite parts of the book were cut for fights scenes that aren't even in the book (after thirty some reading in my lifetime I can't find the battle with the wargs in any book or appendix). I preferred the character development and internal struggle of the characters and Peter Jackson seems to like big battle sequences. Almost all of the missing stuff was put back in. The battle at Helms Deep is more in proportion with it's importance in the book instead of the main focus of the movie.
Now some of the new stuff is great and some is choppy. The Huorns are put back in, but are done in such an awkward way that they were better left out. On the other hand, all the extra Faramir stuff added a depth to the character that made him more consistent with the book, and as a result the lines he says have a lot more background and meaning. Fans of the Ents will be pleased. Still, I admit after watching both versions, I can see why Jackson made the decisions he did.
The theater version is probably the smoother, more easily understood version for those who aren't familiar with the background story. It isn't necessary to know the individual orcs' names to understand the story. You may also not like the length of this version if you aren't dedicated. I watched it over two nights, splitting it at the disc change, to make it less of a marathon.

It is where Legelos takes the shield and slides down the stairs as if the shield were a skateboard or snow board. In a clear attempt to reference modern culture, he slides on the shield and does everything except grab the rail and say, ""Dude."" Why, oh why, is this scene in the movie.

1457937,5,B00005JKZU,"Ever since The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrived in theaters in December 2001, there has been an ever-growing obsession with J.R.R. Tolkien that has engulfed millions of people world-wide.  Director Peter Jackson, and countless other actors believe without a doubt that The Lord of the Rings trilogy has already made cinematic history.  With its epic scenes, well-developed characters, and unmatchable special effects, The Lord of the Rings could very well be as excellent as Star Wars, if not better.  Peter Jackson could quite possibly be giving George Lucas and run for his money.  In Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the heart-wrenching story of four hobbits and the gripping suspense for the battle of Middle-earth will leave audiences begging for more.
 Unlike the first movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the characters of Frodo and Sam are much more developed and intensified in The Two Towers.  As Frodo and Sam begin their journey alone, in pursuit of the destruction of the ring, Frodo's deteriorating soul is ultimately revealed to the audience.  Since the power of the ring intensifies, Frodo unconsciously becomes more dependent on Sam in order to successfully destroy the ring.  The damage the ring has on Frodo's mind and well-being causes the audience to wonder what type of fate lies ahead for Frodo.
 When Gollum was first introduced to the audience in The Fellowship of the Ring, he remained a mystery as far as who he really was and what his purpose was in the story.  As soon as Gollum joins Frodo and Sam in their endeavor, Gollum's severe case of schizophrenia brings his inner turmoil to the audiences' attention.  It is also revealed that Gollum's real name is Smeagle and the name of Gollum belongs to his evil alter ego who appears to have full control of Smeagle.  Smeagle's battle with Gollum causes the audience to have tremendous pity for him, which alters his persona of a monster to a kind-hearted, suffering soul.  In the scene where Gollum engages in a verbal battle with Smeagle, the true spirit of Smeagle is brought to light with an amazing script and an impeccable development of character.
 A major restoration of hope arrives and perpetuates when Gandalf returns to the story after falling to shadow in The Fellowship of the Ring.  The exasperation of excitement and relief heard in the theaters when Gandalf appeared on the screen only solidified this idea.  With Gandalf back in the picture, the Battle at Helms Deep is anticipated with victory.  Instead of the title Gandalf the Grey in The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf's reincarnation promoted him to Gandalf the White, making him much more powerful.  Since Gandalf was somehow reincarnated, his fate lies in the unknown as well.
 While the story continues, the world-wide anticipation for the final movie will only grow in massive proportions.  Although The Two Towers answered many questions that arose from The Fellowship of the Ring, it only gave birth to new questions and inquiries that can only be answered with the release of The Return of the King.  After witnessing the success of the first two movies, it can only be expected the third movie will indeed earn colossal success.  In addition, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is sure to establish its place in box office history.  Until December 17, 2003, when The Return of the King is released, the audience will be anxiously awaiting.",1070323200,,3437,4.898100172711572

Simply put, this extended release changes the film in a dramatic way.  New scenes depict a rich tapestry of relationship that was not allowed to develop, being buried under an avalanche of battles in the theatrical release.  This is not the same version with added ""deleted scenes"" but rather a different film altogether!

1458043,5,B00005JKZU,"The OTHER greatest film I've ever seen
About a year ago, I watched the Extended DVD Edition of Fellowship of the Ring, and declared
this ""the best film I'd ever seen"". I was highly anticipating the second film in the trilogy, The Two Towers, as this was my favourite book in the original trilogy, and I had faith that Peter Jackson and co. could faithfully adapt this wonderful book to the silver screen. In the end, I do have some criticisms of the final result, but the Extended DVD Edition has put to rest many of my initial reservations. And these changes in no way affected my sheer joy and love of this film, and the series as a whole.
From the subdued music that opens the film, it's obvious that the second film will be much darker and grimmer than the first. This is wholly appropriate, as both Sauron and Saruman are now gathering their forces for an assault upon Middle Earth. The enroaching darkness is one glaring point that I missed while reading the original novel, so kudos to Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh for picking this up.
I honestly didn't think that the opening sequence of the first film could be topped - but it has. The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog is nothing short of stupendous - it's a vicious and nasty combat engagement between two mortal enemies, but at the same time it has a fantastical element that takes your breath away.
On my initial viewing of the film, the parts that I enjoyed least were Frodo and Sam's journey. This is tied up with my own experiences from the book - I always skipped over Frodo and Sam's experiences in the Two Towers, as I found them rather boring. This was obviously a huge mistake. Frodo's conflict is an internal and psychological one - the ring is attempting to possess his soul, and the introduction of Gollum is a constant reminder of what may happen to him should he falter in his quest.
And as for Gollum? The character of Gollum is one of the greatest triumphs in the area of special effects. He is a living breathing character, not an artful arrangement of pixels on a computer screen. Credit for much of that goes to Andy Serkis and the team at WETA Digital. Until viewing the extras, I had no appreciation of the sheer level of craftmanship that went into the creation of Gollum. The Academy Award for Special Effects was richly deserved.
The battle with the Warg Riders was an inspired addition to the film. It's something that could've happened between the journey to Edoras and Helm's Deep. However, like some others, I do have misgivings about Aragorn's ""faked death"". Anyone who has read ""Return of the King"" knows that Aragorn will obviously survive.
As for scenes with Aragorn and Arwen, I think Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are grossly underestimating the audience's intelligence. We all remember who Arwen is, and what stake she has in the story. So nobody is going to mind if she doesn't appear in the second film.
Helms Deep  is an epic battle done right. Peter Jackson inserts scenes to remind the audience just exactly who Aragorn and Theoden's Army are defending. An example is of the mother urging her children to flee the beseiged village. It totally ripped my heart out when I saw it for the first time.
It was pleasing to note that the Extended DVD had more scenes fleshing out the character of Treebeard. The scene with Treebeard's ""poetry"" was a nice touch. As a reader who was almost bored to tears with some of Tolkien's poems, I can well emphathise with this reaction. And I absolutely loved the scene with the Ent Draught.
One of the biggest misgivings I had with the second film, was the change to the character of Faramir. After viewing the Extended DVD, I know understand why those changes were made. When Faramir escorts them to an escape exit from the beseiged city of Osgiliath, we finally see the noble character of Faramir from the books.
My favourite DVD extras are the ""Cameras in Middle Earth"" and the Directors commentary, It's very clear that the comraderie between the actors didn't end with the first film. Bernard Hill is a perfect addition to the cast (""Look! Jamboree Sides!""), and is obviously a perfect foil for the mischevious Viggo Mortensen. And Dominic Monaghan's disclosure of Viggo Mortensen's indiscretions with a bearded lady of Rohan were absolutely priceless. And yes Dominic, I expect that Viggo will kick your a** after watching the DVD!
I enjoyed the cast commentary on the first film, but the cast commentary on the second film was curiously subdued. I suspect this was because the four hobbits (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) were sheperded into separate rooms.
The director's commentary on the other hand, was extremely enjoyable this time around. Some favourite moments? Peter Jackson comparing the peasants at Edoras to those from the Monty Python films (""Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead!""). A potential scene where Gandalf turns up at Lothlorien stark naked, after his resurrection (""It wouldn't be Lord of the Rings, it'd be Ring of the Lord"" quips Fran Walsh). Peter Jackson going on about a super expanded edition of the DVD in fifty years time (""Oh pleeeaaasseee stop!!!"" wails Philippa Boyens). And finally, Peter Jackson musing on a spin-off detective series for Treebeard (""He does solve mysteries. It's just that it takes him a looooonnng time to get there""). Absolutely priceless.
In summary, I strongly recommend that you buy the Expanded Edition, regardless of whether you are a fan of Tolkien or not. I remember showing the first film's Expanded DVD Edition to my parents, and they were very impressed with what they saw. And they aren't the world's biggest LOTR fans. So go ahead, spend your hard earned cash. I guarantee you won't regret it.",1070236800,2,5739,4.739
1458044,5,B00005JKZU,"I own and have reviewed the ""LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring"" gift-set.  I said in that review that that gift-set would ""delight"" the receiver.  The ""Two Towers"" will rather leave the receiver ""extremely pleased"" for two reasons.
One is this year's fifth disk is not a solid documentary, but a program-length commercial for the consumer products of the WETA workshop.  A very informative, well-produced program-length commercial, but a commercial nonetheless.
Two is the movie itself.  A small minority of the scenes added to this extended edition are padding.  However, it is like the extended edition of FOTR an improvement over the theatrical version.
The main attraction of this gift-set is the sculpture of ""Smeagol.""  The figurine remains like its predecessors,  living-room quality.  It is much larger than the pair provided with the FOTR.  They are making the twin ""Gollum"" statue available to buyers of this package for about $80.  How equitable this trade-off might be, I leave to you to decide.
The packaging for this release in the trilogy remains first-rate.  It is beautiful to look at, and is solidly packed.  So solidly packed, I had to destroy it to get to the materials.  A demerit for those hoping to preserve it for their collection.
Again, this is well worth the investment, only in comparison to its predecessor does it fall short.
All reports are that the ""Return of the King"" is the best of the trilogy.  Here's hoping the gift-set is the same.",1070236800,,1465,4.950819672131147
1458045,5,B00005JKZU,"The extended version of The Two Towers is undeniably a better film than the one we watched in the cinema. At the end of the day it's impossible to give this version less than 5 stars.
But this review doesn't deal with the film's merits. It's an attempt to understand why the film is, ultimately, flawed - and why it doesn't manage to live up to its predecessor.
I think the answers to this stem from one simple but essential choice Peter Jackson has had to make: he's chosen a different approach to the story than Tolkien's.
Tolkien, you may remember, opted for two seperate storylines, told one after the other. The second of these deals with Frodo and Sam's journey (in)to Mordor. The first deals with the other remaining members of the Fellowship and leads to the battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard.
Jackson, on the other hand, has cut up the story into three parts and then tells all three stories at one and the same time, switching from line to line and back again throughout the movie. This inevitably means that the different lines each have to be roughly equal in duration and that each line must find a resolution of sorts in a climax at the end.
With this approach, though, Jackson gets into trouble with all three lines.
His problems are least grave in the first line, since that deals with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and culminates in the natural climax of Helm's Deep. Still, all is not well even here. Had Jackson stuck to the original story he'd have been fine, but unfortunately he decided to invent new material to keep Aragorn's romance with Arwen to the fore. This material is also used to introduce a quasi-death similar to Gandalf's in Fellowship. On both counts Jackson doesn't manage things all that well: the Arwen sequences are rather muddled and distracting, whilst someone should have told Jackson that it's best not to repeat a good trick twice, lest it becomes unconvincing both times round.
The second line deals with Merry and Peppin in Fangorn Forest and should have been wonderful, given their encounter with Treebeard and the other Ents. But in order to have this line's climax (the attack on Isengard) coincide with the battle of Helm's Deep, Jackson has had to draw things out to the point of over-extension. The overall feeling I got when watching these sequences was that of Merry and Pippin being carried around almost endlessly through the forest until the Ents (in a precipitate and therefore unconvincing turn-around) decide to act. This line is not helped by the fact that Jackson does not seem to understand the Ents in the first place; they are presented as dim and comical, rather than ancient and wise.
The third line deals with Sam and Frodo (and Gollum) and must really have put Jackson in a pickle. You can merge Helm's Deep with the assault on Isengard, since they are both battles against Saruman. But where to fit in Shelob in between this? You can't, so Jackson didn't - he moved it to the third film (The Return Of the  King). That left him dangling, though, since it meant that the third line would be left without any sort of climax at all. And that's where the extraordinary re-invention of Faramir comes into play. In a far cry from Tolkien's original vision, Faramir is presented as a threat, an obstacle that Frodo and Sam must surmount to continue their quest to Mount Doom.
In the theatrical version, the Faramir scenes rightly left Tolkien fans reeling in horror. Faramir an enemy? Ridiculous! But it has to said that the extended version at least makes this jump comprehensible; it is here, more than anywhere else, that the extended version surpasses the original. Still, it doesn't really work, since Jackson has to leap not once, but twice, the second jump being to get Faramir to releasing Frodo and Sam (to change him back to being a good guy, if you will). Jackson manages the first jump, but fails at the second; the reasons for Faramir's sudden turnaround are left largely unexplained.
Given all these points, a basic question arises - why get yourself into the positon where you have to fiddle around so fundamentally with the greatest story ever told? Might it be that Jackson's basic approach to The Two Towers is fundamentally wrong?
I simply don't know. I don't think anyone can really know, yet. Presumably, we'll only be able to answer this once the Return Of The King is out (the extended version, that is!).",1070236800,,4392,4.703896103896104
1458046,5,B00005JKZU,"There's a reason (beyond Tolkien's neurotic fanbase) that this film has been so well received.  And it's largely because of one man's vision about the making of the LOTR trilogy.  His name is Peter Jackson, and he deserves our notice (as this film shows us).
But let's get into the film shall we . . .
The Two Towers is the continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is based on the second book in J.R.R. Tolkien's magnum opus, The Lord of the Rings, which, in itself, is a continuation of the children's novel, The Hobbit.  But don't be misled.  The Lord of the Rings is NOT a children's story.  This is a fantasy story for mature teens and adults.  It's dark, violent and very complex.
This story picks up exactly where it's predecessor---The Fellowship of the Ring---left us.  Frodo and Sam find themselves running in circles.  That is, until Gollum (aka Smeagol) forcibly joins their company just so he can be close to The One Ring that Frodo is carrying toward Mount Doom inside Mordor, where he must cast it into the fire in order to destroy the spirit of Sauron (which dwells within The Ring).  The acting of the Gollum character is excellently portrayed and pulled off by a combination computer generated image and real person.
Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pursuing a band of Orcs who've kidnapped Merry and Pippin.  When they believe that Merry and Pippin were accidentally killed by a band of horsemen from Rohan, they despair.  But not for long.  Gandalf is reincarnated as a White Wizard, sent back to turn the tides of Middle Earth.  He tells Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas that Merry and Pippin are safe with The Ents (a group of talking trees as old as mountains...sort of).
These are the two main storylines from which the camera switches back and forth.
It is worth noting here, too, that almost all of this filming took place in New Zealand.  And they did an excellent job scouting out their locations.  The mountain-top Hall at Edoras was absolutely spectacular, as were the shots of Helm's Deep.
For those interested in ""extra footage"", this platinum series edition DVD is sure to be of great joy to them.  Let me show you why:
1.  Sam and Frodo have more screen time as they move toward
Mordor, so the sense of time passing is more evident (this is sure to please LOTR purists).
2.  Boromir returns!  Scenes depicting his angst against his father and those between his brother (Faramir) and the father are also excellently done and add weight for what is to come later.
3.  More time with Merry and Pippin and The Ents.  Merry and Pippin get to drink from the Ent Wash and grow a bit, as well as having them find Sauruman's stash of food toward the end of the film.  And the Ents talk so much that you get a better sense of how slow their thought processes are.
There is, of course, more but I don't want to spell all of it out for you.  If you're a fan of the books AND the films, you'll love this extended platinum edition.

The extended version is a delight, Jackson adds the whipped cream and cherries to the already delicious  banana split of a movie.",1070236800,,305,4.446428571428571
1458048,5,B00005JKZU,"This version, while not as much an improvement as the extended version of Fellowship was, is still vastly improved from the theater cut. With one exception, the extra bits add so much to the story that they alter the story itself in some ways. The additions were things I missed from the original. Scenes made less sense when they were cut; the added pieces that brought out the characters in new and more enlightening ways were put back in. This version is far more true to the story and far less dark in theme.
No spoilers, just hints: Now you understand the horse that comes to Aragorn as he lays in the river; the aftermath of the flood of the valley by the ents; more about Frodo and Sam leaving the beseiged city; more about the story behind Faramir, his brother and his father.  Just more, all around.
And it's a beautiful case.
I suppose the extras are nice too, but all I wanted was the full version of the movie. The other cut is like when you import a movie or TV show to one country from another, and the censors cut pieces out: it just doesn't make as much sense, and it tends to be awkward. This shouldn't be called ""extended"", since it seems to be more the way it was meant to be seen.

1458049,5,B00005JKZU,"As with the Fellowship, the extended version of Two Towers is actually better, more coherent, a bit closer to Tolkien and more fully realized in its vision than the version seen in theaters a year ago. My only complaint, the anachronistic use of the term ""nervous system"" when the word ""head"" would have sufficed (you'll know to what I refer when you see it in the added footage). Otherwise, the added footage better develops the characters and the story as I'm sure J.R.R.T. would have preferred. The two Appendices DVDs showing how every aspect of the film was made are wonderful, informative and entertaining in their own right. The documentary on how Gollum came to the screen is especially interesting. There are also explanations by the writers on how and why they altered part's of Tolkien's novel for the film, and while I didn't agree with the reasons for all of the changes (and you may not either) it was interesting and some consolation to get these concise explanations directly from the screenwriters.
If you did not like the changes to the story when you saw this film in the theater last year then you won't like this extended version any better, but if you enjoyed it then you'll likely find this version even more engrossing and enjoyable on repeated viewings. If you buy the Gift Set you'll get the extended version DVD set plus you'll also get a beautiful Gollum collectible resin figure and another DVD about it and other collectibles.

1458116,4,B00005JKZU,"I'm a huge ""Lord of the Rings"" geek.  I've seen both films countless times and I've read the books twice.  Though it was an excellent movie, I was somewhat upset with the theatrical cut of ""The Two Towers"" for not following the book.  That is somewhat remedied in the Special Edition, which has some nice extras.
There is between 30 and 45 minutes of added footage (I've heard various numbers and I didn't bother to time it), and for the most part I loved it.  There are some scenes that add nothing to the film and probably should have stayed cut from the film- a nightime conversation between Aragorn and Gandalf and a final goodbye between Faramir and Frodo are the most glaring examples.
However, the character of Faramir is finally given some justice in the Special Edition, as he's shown as a more complex and conflicted character (unfortunately, it still takes him a while to let Frodo and Sam go).  I also loved the added footage of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard- look for references to the cut Tom Bombadil scene from ""Fellowship"".  Overall, the characters are better fleshed out, and their interaction with one another is far more interesting than it had been in the theatrical cut.
I'd definitely recommend the Special Edition to fans of the book.  It overall feels much more like a Tolkien product than the theatrical cut, and adds some scenes that they would have liked to have seen in the original cut.  However, the more casual fans of ""Lord of the Rings"" who only like the action may want to stick with the theatrical cut- the Special Edition has a lot more talking than fighting.  Me being a book fan, I absolutely loved this version.",1070150400,,1653,4.633561643835616

1458119,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers Extended edition is to its theatrical version what the extended version of the Fellowship of the Ring is to its  abridged theatrical release. Without wanting to give anything away, all I can say is the human element that makes us care about the characters and elevates the story beyond mere action extravaganza is all here in the added 45 odd minutes of footage, balancing and smoothing out the film into a grander arc that is well worth the nearly 4 hours running time. For the purists I will add that while the extended version of the film does indeed still veer  off course from the book, Faramir's character is somewhat redeemed, as his underlying motives for taking the ringbearer off his path is better understood with the added footage, as is Aragorns Dunadean heritage made clear. Also, more time is spent with the Ents, which adds a nice contrast to the more frenetic pace of the concurrent storylines. All of the extras slow the pace of the film and makes the editing feel less choppy. This is indeed the film Jackson intended to make . It is film making on an epic  scale with an attention to detail that may be unrivaled in the history of film making. Hands down, the extended version is the only way to see this film, and that goes for the first installment as well.
The bonus features are rich and extensive, making the incredible effort it took to bring the trilogy to the screen more palpable, which in turn helps the viewer appreciate the true cinematic achievement of these films even more deeply.",1070150400,3,1530,4.617647058823529

Only a half hour in, and I'd seen several deleted scenes which really enriched and expanded on the story. I think there's fourty minutes in all of new scenes. On top of that there's two full disks of behind the scenes extras, from the evolution of Gollum to the construction of Helm's Deep and Rohan, concept art, and many, many interviews with cast members. Just about every aspect of the film is covered. Even if you already have the first Two Towers dvd, I'd recommend this one. It's well worth it.",1070150400,,688,4.838983050847458

1458123,4,B00005JKZU,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is definitely a monumental achievement.  Though I would take up issue with the claims that it is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, it certainly renders a wonderful epic better than any film one can imagine.  Any slander that the film receives from those that compare it to the books is merely useless talk: of course these films will not be as good as the books.  How can anyone expect a book that lives in the imagination of reader's minds and dwells there for countless hours of reading can even hope to be rendered in a three hour film?  We're lucky that these films are as long and carefully thought out as they are.  And as an English major and proponent of reading, any film that inspires people to go out and read more books is fine by me.
This film aches in parts; I find that the love stories in the film tend to be uninteresting and forced in comparison to the action sequences.  I believe that Jackson is much more comfortable rendering scenes of battle than those of passion.  True to this statement, the battle scenes in ""The Two Towers"" are absolutely stunning.  Calling to mind wonderful battle scenes of medieval and ancient times, these battle scenes are reminiscent of the images we receive in ""The Iliad"" and other epic battle poems.
All in all, I applaud Jackson's efforts to render the trilogy with as much attention to detail as he has given it.  And, of course, I hope the films inspire people to read more than just Tolkien's wonderful works, to include the epic poetry and world that he himself was drawing from.",1070064000,4,1584,4.529824561403509

1458236,3,B00005JKZU,"If movies like Gladiator, Braveheart and maybe Star Wars are among your very favorites, you can put The Two Towers (as well as the Fellowship of the Ring)  right up there with the best big budget, action-adventure epics. If, on the other hand, like me, you are more of a fanatic for the Tolkien books, you may not be quite as thrilled with the films. The Two Towers is unsurpassed for special effects, action (especially battle scenes), costumes and scenery. The acting is fine and it follows the book fairly well. As far as being true to the spirit and atmosphere of the book, however, it falls short. As I see it, The Lord of the Rings is a fantasy adventure that is really about Middle Earth, a world where magic is real. Although the War for the Ring is the central plot feature, it is actually secondary to the overall feeling Tolkien evokes from his vivid descriptions of Middle Earth and its diverse inhabitants. The film, meanwhile, is primarily about the war, and the magic and colorful creatures are reduced to the essential (but ultimately expendable) roles they have to play, such as heroes and villains. As for the War itself, I think that Tolkien had a sense of historical events such as wars similar to Tolstoy, as expressed in War and Peace. This is a sense that it's not necessarily the great and mighty who determine the course of events, but sometimes the seemingly less important folk, as well as random chance. Proof of this is that the most important characters, in terms of the final outcome, are the hobbits and Gollum (who, btw, is brilliantly portrayed in the films). Yet, the Two Towers, which focuses on battle scenes more than anything else, approaches the war in the traditional, Hollywood, gung-ho spirit, with Aragorn and Gandalf (and sometimes even the Hobbits), often rallying the troops to bravery and heroism. Not that the book does not contain bravery and heroism, but it's more subtle and nuanced than in the film. There are a couple of sequences that stand out for me as significant, if relatively minor, departures from the novel. One is where Faramir, the brother of the slain Boromir, is tempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. In the book, Faramir is a wise man who is never really tempted to take the ring, but in the film, it is the hobbits who must teach Faramir a lesson. Along similar lines, the Ents in the film, while beautifully rendered, come across as somehow less wise than in the book. Tolkien portrays the Ents, along with Tom Bombadil (who is entirely left out of the films) as the oldest and wisest creatures of Middle Earth. In the film, they are seen as a bit comical and seemingly in need of instruction from the Hobbits. This indicates the need of mainstream filmmakers to always make the central characters the wisest and bravest, while Tolkien himself had a more complex outlook. I am not stressing these points because I didn't enjoy the film --it is undeniably very entertaining. It does not quite, however, capture the uniqueness of Middle Earth as seen by Tolkien.",1069977600,13,3030,4.695488721804511

I am not a Tolkien fan really, but so far these movies have just been wonderful.  The acting and story lines are just excellent.
For the extra few dollars,compared to the original, this DVD is definetly worth the money you will spend on it.  Take my advice, if you are thinking of buying this DVD or the original Twin Tower movie, get this one, you won't regret it.",1069977600,2,532,4.510416666666667
1458239,5,B00005JKZU,"I was already in love with the original version of ""The Two Towers,"" but now, this extended version has insured that I will never go back to the original ever again.  The additional 40 minutes really brings more out of the movie and transforms it into something magnificent.  ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended Edition)"" is a must-have for anyone who was a big fan of the original version but wanted a little more.
Once again, I was amazed with the added footage.  Even the smallest differences are able to bring out the most from the film.  One of the great things about this edition is that we get to see more of the Hobbits (which the story is supposed to be centered around in the first place).  Seeing more of Frodo and Sam, and Merry and Pippin' was a great way to balance the film with action and drama (I'm always more interested in seeing what's going on with the Hobbits, anyway).  The smallest differences are very noticeable and tie up some of the loose ends that were presented in the original.
What really stands out to me the most in this film are not the epic battle scenes (although they are extremely fantastic and perfectly executed).  No, what stands out to me the most in this movie is the relationship between Frodo and Sam.  ""The Two Towers"" is a much darker film than the first one, and the cinematography does an exceptional job of establishing this.  We really begin to see Frodo lose himself more and more to the Ring.  We fear it because we know what is has done to Gollum.  In fact, one of the most touching scenes (even though this wasn't an additional scene; it appears in the original) is when Frodo tells Sam that he wants to help him.  When Sam asks why, Frodo somberly replies, ""Because I have to believe that he can come back.""  This is a crucial moment in the story, because Frodo is slowly beginning to realize what the Ring is doing to him, and if he isn't careful, he will end up exactly like Gollum.  Also, if Gollum can't come back, then Frodo knows there's no way he can ever help himself out of the darkness as well.  Seeing more of Frodo and Sam really does make the film that much better, or at least that's the way I see it.
The four-disk set is loaded with extras, featuring a number of documentaries.  One in particular stands out (I believe it is the second one on the third disk) because it features the director and writers going into great detail to explain why things were changed, moved around, or removed altogether.  And I have to admit, a lot of it made sense.  There were just some things in the books that would not have translated as well onto film.  So, I highly recommend that fans of the books or films check out that particular documentary.  Commentaries are also featured as well as a very neat ""Easter Egg"" on the first disk (hint: look deeper into the ""scene selection"" page).  The movie also looks and sounds incredible, as well.
""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended Version)"" is the only way to watch this movie.  What was once a great movie is made into something even better.  This is shaping up to be one of the most incredible epics on film (and boy, do we ever need one with the horrific things happening with the new ""Star Wars"" movies!).  While people may be satisfied with the original version, this new extended version is something that should not be missed.

1458240,5,B00005JKZU,"I'll keep this brief: FIRST - this film is a wonderful ADAPTATION (for all you whining purist freaks out there) of a great literary creation. The changes are compelling and add to the story. If you don't like a decision Peter Jackson made merely because it is different then what Tolkien wrote (regardless of whether it makes sense, or adds tension, or character development etc.) then you are a fool. The LOTR is a story, a piece of art, a hobby, or even a passion; but NOT A RELIGION. Wake up.
SECOND - to the reviewer (oceanaut1) who mentioned that Jackson made a mistake because Frodo showed the Ring to the Nazgul - you are wrong and an idiot. The Nazgul are basically blind - they could only pinpoint the ring if Frodo wore it; which is why Sam stopped him. At least do your research before complaining.",1069891200,2,809,4.472972972972973

1458242,5,B00005JKZU,"Arguably better than the first installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, The Two Towers is a more than seamless continuation of the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring, and are now guided by the deceitful Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join the fight to defend the city of Rohan as Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his dark lord Sauron proceed with their plan of the eradication of mankind. More violent, fast paced, and with a more epic feel; The Two Towers is, as of this typing, the best action/fantasy adaptation yet; and while it may not take place exactly as Tolkien himself had written it, he himself would nod his head in approval of the fantastic job done by director Peter Jackson. Most of the cast from Fellowship of the Ring has returned: including Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis providing his movements and voice as Gollum, who is a fantastic pinnacle of how far computer animation has come today. The battle scenes are more than epic; including the climatic slickly put together battle of Helm's Deep. All this however is only a taste of what is to come with the third and final film in the trilogy: the eagerly anticipated The Return of the King.

1458328,4,B00005JKZU,"I had very high expectations for this DVD, and they are fulfilled by all means. The extra scenes are great additions, but I feel they were sometimes tedious. If the disk only came with the extra  Gollum and Faramir scenes, it would have been more than enough- I could see why the others were cut. The Faramir scenes in particular explain much about why Faramir is portrayed as a hindrance rather than a helper in the theatrical version- more on this is said in the appendices of the DVDs.
After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition's extras,(herein abreviated as FOTR) I was wondering if there was anything left to say, since so much was covered. Of course, there was much, much more to be said. There are literally thousands of production pictures and concept art, besides the 3hr documentaries on each disk- which are of course phenomenal. Whereas the original DVD focused on previz and the cast's experiences, this focuses more on other concepts and the experiences of the concept team and writer/director stuff. One truly understands that these people put their hearts and souls into this film, and even moreso. I'd go so far as to say this is probably the single largest motion-picture endevour ever, PERIOD.
So why not five stars? Not because of the changes from the book- by all means they were neccesary to keep the movie from boring the viewer. This movie sometimes got too tedious for my liking- even more tedious than the first half hour of FOTR. It is still a great film and the extra scenes still add much needed depth- it'll probably grow on my as I keep watching(three different commentaries!!!)

I waited for this version to come out, rather than buy the theatrical version. And I have to say I'm glad I did.
As with the 'Fellowship' extended disc, Jackson does an outstanding job of re-intergrating cut scenes that he had wanted in anyway. This in and of itself is important. Unlike many other 'directors cuts', which come about much later and seem a bit slapdash, these are saemless and well prepared. Additional soundtrack was recorded, the effects were of the same high calibre as its predecessor, and all the scenes are there for a reason. Many interesting bits of information are spread out within the main body of the film, as well as several humorous monents which help cut the sometimes pervasively dark tone of the film.
Buy this one, and sell your puny 2-disc set.
Combined with 'Fellowship', you have over 7 hours of great film. When the 'Return of the King' extended version comes out (of which there will be one: Jackson spoke of cutting several scenes dear to him for time), that will be almost a half-days worth of good filmmaking to veg out on.

The relationships between the characters, and the relationship between the different peoples, and races were not clearly established.  I went off a little confused about the overall plan of Sauron and Saruman.  The extended platinum version took care of that.  It had extended scenes where, if you had seen the original Two Towers, after seeing the extended scene you were saying to yourself, ""Okay, I get it now"", or ""Okay, that makes better sense"".  If you are going to purchase the Two Towers, most definately get the extended edition.  It will be worth it.  As you watch the new scenes, pay close attention to the dialog.  There are several extended scenes where it sets you up for the third movie.",1069804800,3,817,4.869565217391305

1458456,5,B00005JKZU,"Director Peter Jackson's movie version of The Two Towers pays full respect to the most sorrowful part of J.R.R. Tolkien's mighty Lord of the Rings trilogy.
This is a sadder, more frightening film than The Fellowship of the Ring, but it is also more exciting, more visually dynamic and more sweeping in its vision. This, film fans, is an epic with a capital E.
FILM REVIEW
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
(PG-13; epic battle sequences, scary images) Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Peter Jackson. 179 minutes.
The story picks up almost exactly where Fellowship ended, with the original adventurers separated, and Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) facing the next perilous journey alone. All we see from the first film is the wizard Gandalf's apparently fatal plunge into the center of the Earth as he battles the horrendous Balrog monster - a special-effects scene as masterful as modern technology and artistic imagination will allow.
A short while later, an even more astonishing techno-wonder awaits in the character of Gollum, a creature generated entirely by computers based on the body and voice of actor Andy Serkis. Gollum has been kept largely under wraps in advance of the movie, the better to astonish audiences with his shocking authenticity. This is by far the most expressive, least mechanical, computer-generated figure ever seen on screen, and the movie's most engrossing character to boot.
Once a Hobbit-like being named Smeagol, Gollum was corrupted by the One Ring that Frodo now carries. Gollum dogs Frodo, hoping to steal the ring back. Frodo's appeal to the part of him that is still Smeagol reveals a divided person who carries the battle between good and evil in his own head.
Frodo's goal is the ring's destruction in the pit where it was forged, thereby stopping the resurrection of the disembodied Sauron, who has set his wicked wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) to the task of wiping out beauty, peace and freedom among humans, hobbits and their friends.
The movie crosscuts from place to place as Frodo and Sam struggle toward Mordor, tracking friends Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) in a magical forest overseen by ancient, tree-like beings called Ents, as well as the race by dwarf Gimli (voice of John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to save their friends.
The action peaks when the Fellowship warriors find a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellen in another sharp, detailed performance) and rally the humans of Rohan to fight Saruman's massive forces. (Be advised that the movie earns its PG-13 rating with thrilling but often horrific combat.)
Mr. Jackson, who wrote the screenplay with Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair, interprets Tolkien's stormy vision with tremendous insight and empathy. Frodo's weakening spirit, Gollum's pathos, Sam's loyalty, the fury and dread of the final assault on Helm's Deep - it's all there on the screen, as powerfully as it was on the pages of the great novel. Mr. Jackson has taken a few liberties with the book, but none that destroy its sense or sensibility.
Plot complexities are explained in part with flashbacks, flash-forwards and narrative recaps. It is possible the tale could confuse some who are not familiar with the books, but even non-readers of Tolkien stand to be swept up in the film's urgent pace and emotional intensity - not to mention its breathtaking visual riches.
The Two Towers is every bit the momentous event fans have been hoping for. All it lacks is three more hours of the story. That comes Dec. 17, 2003. Mark the date.",1069804800,,3613,5.03338898163606
1458457,5,B00005JKZU,"Awesome !!!!  I just now finished watching everything from this Special Edition Two Towers and it is just wonderful !!!! The extra 43 min. of added Scenes to the film really made an allready great movie much better !! Not only was it better but it helps set you up better for The Return of the King !!
  We get a flashback of Denethor with his two sons Boromir and Faramir all 3 together and it's very nice ( Denethor plays a big role in Return of the King ). Also the Dead Haradrim and what Sam felt those words are given to Faramir in the movie. Also when the Orcs are taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman it explains more of the Rival with Ugluk and the Orcs of Isengard and Grishnakh and the Orcs of Mordor. Plus More stuff with Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and Fangorn Forest. I don't want to give to much away with this extra 43 min. so it just really explains a lot of things better and makes it more enjoyable. More stuff with Frodo,Gollum,and Sam including an extra Scene where Faramir tell's them the name of the pass into Mordor that Gollum is leading them to is Cirith Ungol where a Dark Terror Dwells ( good set up for Return of the King ) !!!!!!!!
  The Bonus stuff is awesome. 1,800 photos, the documentaries are awesome that explain all this work that went into the Two Towers. It talked some more about J.R.R. Tolkien himself and how he loved Trees and Nature. The 5th Disc was neat how it explained how they made the Gollom Statue and others like it. There is also a book on the Statue of Gollum and the Gollum Statue of him holding a fish is Awesome.
  P.S. By the way my name is in the Fan Club Credits :) Bye
  P.P.S. No new Scenes with the Nazgul but for those who have not seen any version of the Two Towers you will get to see a little bit of them and there Winged Beasts , !!!!  Bye Bye",1069804800,,1812,4.136752136752137
1458458,5,B00005JKZU,"When this DVD extended edition arrived at my doorstep I was like a four-year-old at Christmas.  For the next five nights I hijacked the big screen TV to watch, savor, and enjoy Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of Tolkien's THE TWO TOWERS, the second installment of his masterpiece, ""The Lord of the Rings.""
Sure enough, the 40-plus minutes of extra footage not contained in the theatrical release addressed several of the questions that left Tolkien purists--such as myself--scratching their heads in bewilderment.  I won't go into the details here (as they've already been discussed countless times already), but will state the extra scenes make watching THE TWO TOWERS a more enjoyable experience, for Tolkienites and non-Tolkienites alike.
But even more fascnitating--to me--were many of the features and documentaries carried in the third and fourth DVDs of this set.  There is a virtual avalanche of information to be gleaned from these features; here is but a mere sampling:
--Tolkien himself vigorously opposed his publisher naming the third installment of his book, ""The Return of the King.""  As the author lamented, ""The title gives away the story!""  Tokien wanted to name the final installment, ""The War of the Ring.""
--Initially, the film adaptation of THE TWO TOWERS was to include the character Arwen (Liv Tyler) fighting side by side with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) at Helm's Deep.  Jackson released this information on the film's website, and there was such a negative backlash the decision was made to have Arwen's character portrayed differently in the film.
--A very candid, satisfying explanation from Jackson as to why the tunnel of Shelob was not included in THE TWO TOWERS, but instead will be featured in the next film.
This DVD extended edition is six hours of pure Tolkien bliss--a visual and audio feast of exquisite proportions.  Block out some time in your schedule to travel to Middle-earth, and as Treebeard the Ent would say, ""Don't be hasty!""
--D. Mikels",1069718400,,1984,5.142857142857143
1458459,5,B00005JKZU,"I walked out into the light and am blinking my eyes.  I have spent the last six days watching the Extended The Two Towers DVD.  If you were pondering the worth of this DVD, it IS worth it.
My biggest problem with the Theatrical version of TTT were the Ents.  They didn't seem to play as significant of a role in the film as they did in the book.  I think they had maybe three or four scenes before the final battle.  In the Extended version, this is fixed.  The Ents, Merry, and Pippin now all have enough screen time to make them all present and memorable in the movie.  More than any of the other extras, this is what made the film infinitely better for me.
I watched the Theatrical version so many times in the theater that, at first, some of the added scenes seemed a little out of place.  No worries.  By the time I finished my second viewing of it, the changes seemed very natural.
The commentary with Peter, Philippa, and Fran is wonderful.  A lot of ""purists"" complain about plot and character changes.  If you listen to the commentary, the writers/directors had wonderful justifications for the changes they made.  Most of the character changes were made to add dramatic tension.  Some plot points were changed simply due to lack of time/budget.  I think the changes are well reasoned and, for myself, the explanations given are good enough.  (In fact, the only bits I don't like are not even plot changes.  I'm still bugged by the ""olympic torch orc"" and the ""surfing Legalos"".  That was just silly.)
I loved the theatrical version of this film.  I adore the new DVD version.  I didn't think I could possibly like a movie more than this one...until I watched the second and third disc.  Normally, I don't like ""Behind the Scenes"" bits.  To me, they can ruin a movie.  Often times I'll learn something like a castle or a space ship is a model.  Then, when I go back and see the film, I'll always see the castle or spaceship as a model.
Not in this case.  The Behind the Scenes section made me gain even more respect for this movie.  What I thought was CG was a model.  What I thought was a model was a set.  What I thought was a mat painting was real.  Seeing everyone on the effects crews working their fingers, quite literally, to the bone in order to give the audience a fantastic and detailed presentation was impressive.  The detail they went through for something that may be on screen for less than two seconds was mind numbing.  Detail so fine, and perfect, that the viewer won't even notice it most of the time.  Such as the inlays on the inside of Theodin's armor.  The inside!?!?  I had thought that Barad Dur (the Dark Tower) was CG.  Seeing them create the over 20 foot model with minute detail to be shot for but a few seconds...it was nothing short of amazing.  Examples like that really give the viewer the impression that the people working on this film were: 1) doing something they loved, 2) really cared about the audience and the end product, and 3) wanted to produce something that would last and they could be proud of.  It was inspiring to watch these people under pressure, literally until the minute before the film was due, to give us the best product they could, under the circumstances.
If you own any DVD, get this one.  It has me salivating for Return of the King.  The extras really bring some more human moments to the film.  As a fan of the books, I'm a little worried about where they're going with the Eowyn, Aragorn, Arwen triangle.  The Extended version makes the Eowyn attraction for Aragorn more obvious; and I hope they follow the relationships in the book in the last film.  From the commentary, it sounds like they will.  If they don't, every change they've done so far has worked for me.  After watching the Behind the Scenes, I trust that they will do what they think is best.",1069718400,2,3830,4.450359712230216
1458460,5,B00005JKZU,"While 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was about as close to the original as a movie could get to a book of its size and scope (and set a new gold standard for DVD's with the release of the extended DVD edition), 'The Two Towers' unfortunately differed greatly from the book in some key places angering Tokien purists (of which I do not number myself).
As a movie by itself, 'The Two Towers' is a stunning compliment to the 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' expanding on the themes developed in the first film and bringing audiences closer to the characters than ever and exciting them with some of the best action sequences committed to film.  Finally, like the first film, Peter Jackson refuses to sacrifice plot, character development and good acting on the altar of special effects.
To state it simply, the sequence of the seige of Helm's Deep (although fudging a little more on Tolkien's words, but not his vision) is a classic that will be forever be used to measure epic battle scenes.  The audience feels along with the heroes on screen, the terror and impending doom of the Uruk-Hai seige.  Then it is brought through incredible action sequences and to the very edge of complete dispair before a rousing climax.
The extended scenes that form this new release of 'The Two Towers,' much like the extended cut of the first film, meld seamlessly with the scenes from the theatrical release.  Probably the most egregious departure from the book was the portrayal of Faramir.  In the book he is noble and does not succomb to the temptations of the ring at all, where his brother Boromir failed.  The extended scenes add a little more depth and give some more redeeming qualities to him of which the theatrical release only gives hints.
Moreover, like the extended DVD of ""Fellowship...,"" the documentaries and 'making of' featurettes do not contain a single extraneous moment.  To any Lord of the Rings fan the information presented is always enlightening and fun to watch.
The bottom line is this: if you consider yourself a fan of the film, you owe to yourself to buy or at least view several times this extended edition of 'The Two Towers.'",1069718400,,2138,4.7158176943699734

1458462,4,B00005JKZU,"Well, I will add my comments to the already 1437 reviews already posted... Defintely much improved over the theatrical version. Much more is explained and much more makes sense. Though it is over 3 hrs too long to watch in one sitting, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase to any movie collection. Though some parts I found somewhat overly melodramatic, this extended edition as a whole works quite well. Though, strangely I had the most affinity for Gollum. He is the most fascinating and fully fleshed out and, perhaps the most human character in the whole movie, and perhaps in cinema in the past few years. He embodies all of the contradictions in being human, both good and bad, and yet he is neither. I really feel for the guy. I guess we all have a little Gollum in each of us. thumbs up",1069632000,2,797,4.465753424657534

This 4-disc extended DVD set is quite a better one than the cut edition, there is 40 minutes of new scenes and new music by Howard Shore. The new scenes add more character devolopment and scenes that make even more sense, it also has tons of documentaries on the making of this remarkable sequel including a look of how Gollum was fully made.
There is even audio commentaries, design gallery, a hidden easter egg on Disc 1 and more. So if your a movie lover or anyone who loves LOTR then this set would be the perfect gift.",1069632000,,664,4.32
1458464,5,B00005JKZU,"You won't get any meandering from this reviewer, it should be common knowledge that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is quite possibly the best filmed entertainment ever.  Period.  This Special Edition (although a must have item for just the significance of it) is more like a showcase for the scenes that were deleted for good reason.  Unlike FELLOWSHIP's Spec. Ed. which contains vital scenes not in the theatrical version and is presented in a perfect cut, TWO TOWERS Spec. Ed. contains more fluff.  Don't get me wrong, it's still great to see more of a excellent movie, however the experience is elongated with scenes that take away from the sense of dread that builds thoughout the theatrical version.  The scene at the end with MERRY and PIPPEN getting high is almost silly.  Hell, buy it anyway, just be sure to own the disc that came out in August as well so both versions can be enjoyed, they're worth every penny.",1069632000,4,912,4.66875
1458565,4,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson must think blue is the new black, and decided to make a black and white movie in mostly shades of blue.
The movie doesn't give you the same feel that the book does and turns some of it's characteristics into flaws. I still remember a movie critic saying that she didn't understand why Frodo's friend and companion kept calling him ""Mr. Frodo"". That's a mistake easy to understand, when one realizes that the hierarchy that one naturally accepts while reading the book somehow isn't translated into the picture.
When, in ""The Two Towers"" the king says that a certain type of flower always grows on the tombs of his family I instantly and democratically wonder why only his ancestor's dead bodies are untitled to a special brand of flowers. That thought never even crossed my mind while reading the book.
Ian Mckellen is not the Gandalf I envisioned. It is not enough to be old and to look old to get away as an authority figure, no matter how easy Christopher Lee might make it look. Gandalf the character is more of a robust and manly giant, with a gravitas that Ian doesn't have, in this film or any other.
I always imagined Cate Blanchet's character more in the lines of someone like Robin Wright somehow (don't ask me why). Blanchet's wig and Spock like ears do her beauty no favors, as neither does the invisible make-up, or the way it was decided she should play the character, making it come across as a thoroughly disagreeable, suspicious looking type you should be weary of, not as a fascinating, angelically divine woman. That said, the moment when she is tempted to take the ring in the first ""Lord of the Rings"" is superb. There's no such glorious moment for her here.
""The Two Towers"" is indispensable because of:
- A moment of sheer poetry, when Liv Tyler's father explains why she must forget Aragorn.
- Wormtongue. Whatever Brad Dourif does is always outstanding.
- Gollum, the most amazing piece of acting that I've seen in a long while. If there was any justice in the world, they would have created a special Oscar just for him.
- And the Orchs' argument about how it wouldn't hurt to just eat a tiny piece of their prisioner's bodies. It's something no one should miss.",1069632000,,2202,4.6055979643765905
1458566,5,B00005JKZU,"This extended edition is superior to the theatrical release.  The extra forty minutes or so really do add a lot to the story.  Too bad we can't see it on the big screen yet.  This extended edition also has four disks that are full of not only the movie but many other features on the making of the movie and aspects of the story.
While we all wish there were some magical way to see in movie form the experience we had while reading the book that would require each of us to make our own movie.  I am very pleased with what is here and glad for this trilogy being told in such a grand way.
Sometimes the movie drifts a bit too close to being a sword and sorcery epic for my tastes, and The Lord of the Rings is definitely NOT that.  Yes, it has magic, and battles, and enchanted figures.  But it is a story about some big human issues first and last that is told on the backdrop of magic and swords.  It is a beautiful story and has had a powerful impact on the lives of many who read it.  I think the movie does as good a job with these wonderful books as you can expect from Hollywood.  Maybe someday they will do them better, but of the attempts in my lifetime, this is the best.
Now, they could have provided the theatrical release as well, but I think they want you to buy that separately if you want that.  However, there is a handy booklet that points out the extended and new scenes.  But it really isn't possible to reconstruct the theatrical release from this package.  But I can't think of why I would want to.

I can't say much more than that I love it and it's worth every penny to own.

1458568,5,B00005JKZU,"As a Tolkien fan who first read the LOTR over 15 years ago (and has re-read it every year since) I found the extended version of the movie to be infinately more satisfying than the theatrical release.
The first thing I noticed and really enjoyed was the fact that they fleshed out Faramir in this version and we are told on disc three why they changed his character around.  This really helps those of us who don't like change (purists) see what the film makers were thinking.  In the movie Faramir grows from someone who wants to use the ring into someone who realizes its evil.
The second thing which I enjoyed was the love story between Arwen and Aragorn and the fact that we now get to see what is going on between them.  If you read the appendicies of the books you know about the love Aragorn has for Arwen, and you know how it ends, but you don't get to see how it grows and what obstacles it must over come.
Finally, the bonus material explains WHY they ended where they did.  I was disappointed we didn't get to see Shelob and I was worried she might end up on the cutting room floor.  Of course that couldn't be further from the truth.

1458570,5,B00005JKZU,"I won't talk about the movie, because others have said it in spades, - fabulous, gorgeous, brilliant -  but I wanted to say how insanely frustrating the packaging is.

The DVD's pop RIGHT out, smooth as silk, but to get the statue of Gollum/Smeagol out you literally have to destroy the box. I don't think they actually expect collectors to actually want to remove it from the box for personal display. The FoTR bookends were NOT nearly this difficult to remove.

Not only is it glued, the styrofoam protector of the base of the statue is cable tied to each other and the box. The background behind the statue seen though the window has to be removed. The box is a horrid mess to get the statue out.

If you are a collector, and do not intend to tale out the statue for display, fine, the DVDs slide out just great, and you don't have to destroy anything to get at them.

But if you are a fan and want to put the statue on a shelf and save the box for safekeeping, you'll be saving a mangled piece of crap by the time you get it out. (hint: you start from the bottom interlocking flaps on the box  you might have more luck than we did from the beginning)

If there is a easier way to get the statue out, I wish they'd slip in some instructions for removal, I would have loved to have seen it and could have spared myself a cardboard cut cuticle.

I dearly hope they don't do this to us on RoTK Collector's edition.

1458573,5,B00005JKZU,"The extended version is the only version that you should watch or, I believe, that should be shown in theaters.  The added footage completes a number of dangling elements that clearly were in Jackson's mind originally but that for various reasons were left out.  We learn of Faramir's familial status and his relationship with Boromir (as well as a great deal more of Boromir's motivation in joining the Fellowship), the extent to which Wormtongue has consolidated his power, and of the possibility of more sparks between Eowyn and Aragorn.
I believe the extended version, just like its predecessor for Fellowship of the Ring, accomplishes a number of things:
1)  It clearly demonstrates the respect Jackson has for the underlying works.  He picks up on nuances and plotlines that I think most of the self-crowned 'purists' miss.
2)  It shows that whatever side points are missing from the film are missing for a reason.  They were not left out due to laziness or inattention to detail; quite the opposite.  Jackson has obviously made tactical decisions about what to include and what not to, which is far better than having the marketing department pick the parts that lend themselves to making the best action figures.
Jackson has really hit his stride with the second film, and the extended version is the definitive version to see.  I believe the sole reason lesser versions are released to theaters is due to the running times of the film rather than some effort to expand DVD sales; perhaps the Return of the King will receive its full due.  In the interim, I recommend the extended versions of both Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers as representative of the best Hollywood has to offer.",1069632000,8,1701,4.858131487889273
1458695,5,B00005JKZU,"In 2002, one year following the release of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", Peter Jackson directed the next film in the series based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy:  ""The Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers"".  As with the first, the cinematography and special effects used in the second are fantastic and even surpass the first as demonstrated by the computer-generated characters of Gollum (a.k.a., Smagol, with the voice done by Andy Serkis) and Treebeard (voice done by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Gimli son of Gloin in the film).  Peter Jackson's direction of the film was equally brilliant in the second film and the performances by the many actors were realistic and engaging.  As was the case when I first saw the extended DVD version of the first film, seeing the extended DVD version of the second film made the second film come to life far more than I had previously seen in its shorter theatrical release.
The continuation of the story in the second film is darker than the story's beginning in the first film.  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his companion Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue their journey to the land of Mordor.  Climbing over seemingly endless rocks and cliffs, they realize that they have become lost, but also that they are not alone.  Following them is the creature known as Gollum, who had once been named Smagol.  Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who agrees to show them the way to the Black Gate of Mordor.  The other two hobbits who left the Shire, Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), are the captives of a brutal band of orcs lead by one named Uglk (Nathaniel Lees).  He was previously given strict orders from Saruman (Christopher Lee) to bring back the Hobbits unharmed. Having let Frodo and Sam leave on their own, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli son of Gloin (John Rhys-Davies) have vowed to rescue Pippin and Merry and pursue the orcs, who have entered the land of Rohan.  Rohan is lead by King Thoden (Bernard Hill), but all is not well with him and he is under the guidance of a strange advisor, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), who does not appear to have Rohan's best interests at heart.  Grima has his eye on the King's niece, owyn (Miranda Otto), who wants nothing to do with him; but he doesn't like her brother, omer (Karl Urban).  A changed Gandalf (Ian McKellan) returns to join the fight against Sauron, and Frodo and Sam get to meet Faramir (David Wenham), who was the brother of Boromir (played by Sean Bean in the previous film and in the extended version this film only).  Also returning to the second film are the characters Arwen (Liv Tyler), Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), but with lesser roles than in the first.
Memorable scenes in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" include Pippin & Merry's escape from the orcs, Pippin & Merry's meeting of Treebeard, Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum, the return of the changed Gandalf, Gandalf's first meeting with King Thoden, the battle with the riding orcs, the swamp, the arrival of the elves lead by Haldir (Craig Parker), the battle at Helm's Deep and battle of the trees.  The extended DVD version better ties the various scenes in the film together and provides a deeper understanding of several of the characters, especially Faramir and the trees.
Overall, I rate both the regular and extended versions of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It is no wonder that the film won two Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Special Effects and was nominated for four more: Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture.  I highly recommend purchase of the extended version DVD, which breaks the film between two DVD's and includes two extra DVD's that include multiple documentaries, design & photo galleries, an atlas of Middle Earth, etc.  I also can't wait to see the third and final film installment, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", and to purchase it on extended version DVD.",1069632000,5,4099,4.773691654879774
1458696,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers Extended Edition is indeed a much better movie than the theatrical version. Everything you may have been scratching your head over at the theaters has been answered in this extremely well crafted version of the film.
-Wasn't Gollum just a little TOO helpful at the beginning?
-Why didn't the orcs just kill Merry and Pippin?
-Where did those other non-Uruk orcs come from?
-Why is Saruman chopping and burning the forests of Fangorn?
-How can Wormtongue just banish the King's nephew like that?
-Why did Aragorn and co. give up on their search for Merry & Pippin so quickly?
-Why are there so few Ents?
-Why does Aragorn seem almost super-human?
-Where in the world did that horse that rescued Aragorn come from?
-When did all those elves die at Helm's Deep?
-Were all those Ents just waiting to spring out of Fangorn?
-What's up with Faramir???
The relationship development of Frodo, Sam and Gollum is far improved. Merry, Pippin, and the Ents get their much deserved screen time. And Faramir (at least in my opinion) is completely redeemed as a character much like Galadriel was in the extended edition of the first movie. There are some really excellent sequences that simply have to be seen. The visual effects are surprisingly on par with the theatrical version.
Best of all - you get more time to revel in the world that is Middle Earth!
Must-see documentaries in the appendices: The creation of Gollum and adapting the book to screenplay. After watching these even the most die-hard Tolkien purists and/or Jackson haters will have to appreciate what a wonderful achievement in cinema this film truly is.",1069632000,6,1625,4.848920863309353
1458697,5,B00005JKZU,"How do you top the best DVD release of 2002?  By giving Fans and equally great release for 2003.  I held off buying the Two Towers back in August as I wanted to wait for the Extended Edition and it was worth the wait.  The extended edition includes 43 minutes of new footage put back into the movie.  Some are merely extended scenes while many more are brand new, such as Theodreds funeral, and Orcs fleeing Isengard into Fangorn forest and getting a rude welcome, and Faramir warning Frodo about the dark route he plans to take to Mordor, a reference certainly to Shelob's lair.
These scenes add even greater depth to the story and fill in a few minor gaps.  The booklet that comes with the set denotes which scenes are new or extended...awesome planning by Jackson.
Beyond that you get so many extras that all other DVDs pale beside it:  Separate commentaries by director, cast, and crew, dozens of documentaries.  I haven't looked at them all, but they all run 30 - 45 minutes in length so there are hours of extras to view.  Among the best is the Making of Gollum, a 45 minute feature on one of the most interesting characters in the movie.  You get an interactive map and Atlas of middle earth, hundreds of design sketches, many with comments by the artists.  Features on the locations used for filming.  It goes on and on.
The movie itself is great.  While I'm a Tolkien fan, I don't consider myself a purist who gets upset over changes Jackson may have made to the books.  These things are a given when adapted to the big screen.  The Battle at helms deep is one of the best ever on film and I hear the battle in Return of the King will be even better.  I particularly liked the Ents and their destruction of Isengard.
This is the DVD versus which all others should be measured against.  This movie and the first, are reasons alone to buy a DVD player.",1069632000,,1859,4.407624633431085
1458698,5,B00005JKZU,"There's only one trouble with the special edition of THE TWO TOWERS, the same problem tha ""plagued"" the special edition of FELLOWSHIP: once you watch the extended version, the normal version becomes useless!:) YOu simply will not watch it again ever, because the extend edition is much, much better!
This one nears perfection. Everything gets tight, no loose ends, and prepares the viewer for the third part. Eowyn and Faramir are much more developed; for Tolkien purists, yes, there it is the trees killing the fleeing Uruk-hais. There is more interplay between Eowyn and Aragorn. There is also a little comic relief, there is Aragorn revealing his age and making it clear that he is a Dunedain. But the great new scene, im my opinion, was Theodred's funeral when Eowyn begins to sing. It's majestic! It's a kind of a mixture between arcaic, celtic traditional songs, amazing, enchanting.
Also, in the extras, you may agree with them or not, but Jackson and Boyen did not hide from the ""hard"" questions, explaining their reasoning for changing Faramir's character, for sending a platoon of elves led by Haldir to help at Helm's Deep, for increasing the love affair between Arwen and Aragorn.
This DVD is rbeathtaking, the film was much more improved.",1069632000,3,1251,4.961904761904762
1458699,5,B00005JKZU,"I am sure that there are those who are bothered, angry even, that Peter Jackson didn't take a more literal approach to his ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  To those people I would say that a literal word for word translation from text to screen (assuming such a thing were possible, which it's not) would be nothing but mimicry and in no way a tribute to Tolkien's genius.  Rather, I would argue that Jackson's superb interpretation of ""The Two Towers"" beautifully captures the spirit of Tolkien without being slavish in its devotion.  Moreover, Jackson successfully grounds his film in a recognizable reality, which serves to further engage the viewer.
There are three ways (generally speaking) in which Jackson puts his fingerprint on Tolkien.  The first is his interpretation of the text; areas in which without changing Tolkien he is nonetheless able to put his own spin on the text.  There are two salient and superb examples of this that come immediately to mind.  The first is that Jackson presents Gollum/Smeagol as a split personality.  Gollum is a malevolent deceitful being who lusts after the ring, and Smeagol is an almost childlike creature, fierce in his devotion, but easily hurt.  I found this approach to be utterly compelling, and a superb way to present Gollum, but at the same time, it is totally loyal to Tolkien's writing.  The second example is the presentation of Gandalf freeing Theoden from Saruman as a sort of exorcism.  Not only was this a visually intriguing way to present the scene, but it also shows great appreciation for Tolkien as a man.  As a devout Catholic, I suspect he would have appreciated the overtones that swirl about the exchange.
The second way in which Jackson captures Tolkien is in his portrayal of the characters.  Given the constraints of the film format, the director is forced to both condense and flesh out various characters and exchanges.  As such, it is critical that he portrays the characters appropriately, but within the context of the movie.  There are any number of excellent examples to Jackson's characterizations, but there are a few that come immediately to mind.  The first is using Gimli as  much needed comic relief, but doing so in such a way that doesn't degrade the character.  In fact, it has quite the opposite effect as it lends a certain emotional depth to the stalwart dwarf.  Another example is the conflicted Theoden who is almost Shakespearean in his portrayal.  Particularly moving was when at Theodred's grave he flatly states, ""No parent should have to bury their child"" and then breaks down.  Finally, Eowyn's unrequited love for Aragorn is nicely captured, and largely without any dialogue, using glances and expressions to convey the story.
Finally, there is Jackson's modification of Tolkien in order to both make the story work as a film and ground it in our present day reality.  Most surprising among these is the appearance of the Elves at Helm's Deep, as they come to honor the old alliances.  While completely absent from Tolkien's writing, I found this to be an excellent and effective modification.  By introducing the Elves, Jackson is able to paint a portrait of Allies fighting against a common enemy in the World War II sense.  Moreover, the elite Elves and Rohirrim fighting side by side against overwhelming odds echoes Thermopylae, where the grossly outnumbered Spartans saved Greece, and ultimately, Western Civilization, from the Persians.  The second approach is more subtle, but completely pervasive as Jackson takes a fantasy war and couches it in familiar terms.  For example there is a suicide bombing at one point during the Battle of Helm's Deep.  While entirely within the context of Tolkien, Jackson's presentation rather brutally echoes our own dangerous world.  Another fine example is Theoden's question, ""What can men do against such reckless hate?"" which rather succinctly captures the dilemma of fighting terrorism.
My only two complaints are relatively small.  The first is an entirely unnecessary dream sequence between Arwen and Aragorn which badly distracts from the mounting tension between him and Eowyn.  The second is that while Faramir is ultimately true to the book, it takes far too long for him to realize the danger of the ring.  Part of the beauty of his character is how he stands in contrast to his brother Boromir, and this is somewhat eroded by Jackson's interpretation.
As for the discs themselves, they are everything one would expect based upon the first set, as the sound, picture and score are all superb.  Furthermore, I found the additional scenes to be generally excellent.  Theodred's funeral, which features a lament by Eowyn, was particularly moving.  Also, through the addition of a few key scenes, I found the ending to be far more satisfying.  The conclusions to the Battles of Helms Deep an Isengard are less abrupt, and Faramir is better rounded out.
The extras are likewise superb and every bit as fascinating as the features from the first set.  I'm not one who is easily drawn in by commetary on costumes and make-up, but these discs are so comprehensive it is impossible not to be drawn in by them.  Finally, the audio commentaries are likewise comprehensive and interesting.
If you are looking for a slavish recreation of Tolkien's work, you would do well to pass on these discs.  However, if you appreciate the spirit of Tolkien's work, and fine filmmaking, you would do well to watch this film.  Furthermore, you will never find a better value, as the extra's included in this four disc set once again set the standard to which all other releases must strive.
Enjoy!

1458700,5,B00005JKZU,"The special extended edition adds a lot of scenes that smoothed out the story line for me.  I'm not a rabid Tolkien fan, although I remember somewhat enjoying the story as a kid.  As a female, the movie in the theater seemed so much just about battle.  The DVD developed many of the characters much more deeply and made the story more enjoyable for me.  Highly recommended.",1069545600,2,373,4.522388059701493
1458701,5,B00005JKZU,"Between the time I had ordered my Two Towers DVD I read three of four reviews, saying that they had many problems with the special features disks (looping between first 2 tracks, black screen). They even said thy exchanged it with another set and had the problem again! Added to that was the theatrical version DVD I ordered fom amazon skipped at the end. As you could imagine, when it arrived and I went to watch it I was very nervous. The movie worked fine, the DVD picture/sound quality was excellent, the new scenes seamlessly flowed with the old ones. Then I put in disk 3. The menu came up and I played the first documentary. A releif. The rest of the documentaris played fine also (they were amazing). Thank God. Disk four was fine, and I couldn't be happier. Other people has also said they have problems with the packaging(torn DVD case,etc. Mine was in great condition. And could it look any cooler?  All I can say to those who had problems is that you have my condolences. This DVD set is a great value and deserves five stars for everything.

1458702,5,B00005JKZU,"If you have any complaint about the film adaptation and its comparison to the novels, you must buy this DVD set. Several of the added scenes are incredible and would have made the theatrical release more enjoyable, including the Huorns and Merry and Pippin's discovery of pipeweed.
However, the real reason I so highly recommend this set is the commentary on disc 3 titled, ""From Book to Script: Finding the Story"". This is a piece by the writers, directors, and actors responding to all of the criticism from Tolkien's ""guardians"", as they put it. You get the sense that they empathize with all of the rabid fans who tear their works apart online. The commentary reasons that these changes are better for the film adaptation, while honoring the novel as a classic that cannot be touched.
I was first very disgusted by some of the film's ""perceptions"" in the Two Towers. Now, while I still do not agree with all of the changes, I have much more respect for the writers and creators of this movie.
The rest of the material on the appendix discs is equally satisfying. Of exception is the creation of Gollum and Andy Serkis' tremendous contribution to the film.
If you enjoyed the extra discs that came with the Fellowship box, you will love these. From one fan to another, this is money well spent.",1069459200,2,1297,4.668122270742358
1458703,5,B00005JKZU,I loved seeing the new and extended scenes on discs 1 & 2-this half of the dvd set worked fine. This version was a total delight for me and it filled in some blanks and questions I had. Very enjoyable and funny in parts-But discs 3 & 4 will not play as some other people have said. Discs 3 & 4 loop between tracks 1 & 2 as the screen stays blank. I tried playing them on two different dvd players to no avail. Nothing would happen even when I pressed stop-I had to eject the disc to stop it from looping. Could not even bring up the disc menu! I am very sad & disappointed about this. I was so exited about seeing the behind the scenes special extras!!!I will be sending it back to Amazon for a refund (The film part was great so do purchase it for that!).,1069459200,4,756,4.013245033112582

I ruined my box trying to the remove this sheet and the glue residue :-(.",1069459200,2,378,4.164383561643835
1458814,4,B00005JKZU,"The extended scenes are useful in terms of the story, but most of the new scenes are choppy and sometimes whimsical.  The worst was a brief scene where Gandalf tells Aragorn the current state of Middle Earth.  It breaks the first rule of a good narrative: ""show me don't tell me.""  One interesting scene involves Denethor with Faramir and Boromir together.  It is a creative way to build the characters, drawing attention to their uneasy family relationship and the plight of Gondor;  interesting, but wisely cut from the theatrical release.
Strangely enough, the first part of the Two Towers story was moved to the end of the first film, while the ending has been pushed out into the the Return of the King.  Unfortunately the death of Boromir and Frodo's confrontation with Shelob and his subsequent capture are two strengths of the book and their absence weakens this second adaptation.
Tolkien divides the book between the ring-bearer quest and the other story threads.  This makes the book somewhat tedious and it is more difficult to follow which events occur simultaneously.  Jackson deftly weaves among all of the plots more evenly which pulls the story together very well.",1069459200,,1181,4.959390862944162

The background discs offer amazing insight to the immense labour of love this production took, with so many creative geniuses involved from Peter Jackson, down to the simplest detail of sound production or prop design. Everything was done with a dedication to Tolkien that contributes this epic and wondrous trilogy.
The script writers also explain why the character of Farimir was changed and this is one of the most controversial issues in the film vs book dialogue. However, their rationale makes beautiful sense and even though I was not in favour of the change initially, am now convinced that it made the film better.
Beautiful, a tribute to the master of middle earth, and a sad commentary that the so called Oscar's voters cannot see fit to salute Peter Jackson for this awesome achievement.

1458817,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien's The Two Towers was wonderful on the big screen, but the real edition is here -- with 43 sublime extra minutes, which add greatly to the narrative and aesthetics of the theatrical film. As other reviewers have mentioned, scenes with Boromir & Faramir, the Ents and Eowyn flesh out Tolkien's story. (One extra scene, in which Pippin and Merry fight over Ent Draft, does not ring true, but otherwise these added and extended scenes are fantastic.) In this film the Fellowship has been split up -- Merry and Pippin are being taken to Isengard by orcs with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in pursuit, while Sam and Frodo carry the ring into Mordor.

And the fun doesn't stop there! There are four discs in all, and the extras are incredible: featurettes galore -- on production, design, Gollum, the screenplay, Weta, sfx and editing; photo galleries; and FOUR commentary tracks. These documentaries are hours and hours of fun. You'll learn what sound effect is made using a swinging cheese grater, watch PJ and his editors making changes right up to the last minute, watch someone storm off the set and see the dedication of the cast, extras, stunt personnel and the entire crew. Everyone seems to have cooperated with the production of this edition, so you'll find interviews and comments by over 100 cast and crew members. There is a lot of material here, but interactive menus and a printed guide help you navigate, and the material really adds to your enjoyment of the film and the process of making it. If you loved Peter Jackson before viewing the extras, you'll adore him afterward -- an inspired, hardworking, genuinely nice barefoot genius!!  (Some extras are accessible only to those using a PC with Windows 98SE or later.)

The packaging is nice, with a map and line drawings on the case and discs, and new art by Alan Lee on the cover.

1458819,5,B00005JKZU,"The extended version of The Two Towers is richer, flows more smoothly, makes more sense, fills in the blanks on missing motives of a number of characters, most notably Faramir and Eowyn, adds some important details about Aragorn. It provides more depth, background information, humor, and overall character development. Though many of the changes are small, they affected the way I interpreted scenes from the theatrical release, put a slightly different spin on things, making for a fuller experience. Which is not to say the theatrical release didn't hold together well - but the extended version is just a better film.
I'd like to add that I notice a number of people have commented on the disappointing editing done in the theatrical release - to be fair to Jackson, et al, I would say: Just remember the theatres make their money by having multiple shows. They probably limited the length of the film to get more showings in per day. It would take planning for an intermission and a greater commitment by theatres to fit in what is essentially a four-hour movie. I don't think that's intentional ""dumbing down"" for the audience, it is just a business decision a lot of us would rather they didn't have to make.",1069459200,33,1215,4.818181818181818
1458820,5,B00005JKZU,"As with Fellowship, I really think this extended addition to Two Towers is a great improvement.  I enjoyed the theatrical version immesely, but this release is that much better.  In particular, the changes to Faramir's character makes much more sense now with the addition of the Osgiliath scenes.  While I was initially very bothered by the alteration in his character, now I actually approve.  He is the same Faramir that Tolkien wrote with more of a dramatic twist.  He is tempted by the ring, but never, unlike Boromir, tries to take it from Frodo.  He has to see what the ring does to Frodo before he can really understand its danger and let it go.  There is also a lot more Gandalf in this version, more Treebeard, and a bit of an extended ending which adds elements from the book.  Overall, I think the additions bring the movie closer to Tolkien's original vision of the story.  In one of the documentaries, someone argues that a lot of Lord of the Rings is about fighting despair.  I think whoever said that really captured the essence of the book and the film.  For all the changes that had to be made, this movie still captures the spirit of of Tolkien's writing.
The extras are really something as well.  The docmentaries on Tolkien, the script, editing, and filming are all excellent, but the highlight has to be the documentary on Gollum and Andy Serkis.  The Gollum figure that comes with this set is very well done (if you can get it out of the box!), but the fifth disk on the creation of the statue(s) is really sort of a let down (less than a half hour long).  It felt like an extended sales pitch for Sideshow-Weta.  If you get this set, you are really getting it for the Gollum figure.",1069459200,2,1706,4.4935064935064934
1458821,5,B00005JKZU,"Although it is not really necessary to stick to the knitting of the script of Tolkein's book, what the extended version displays in dramatic form is how far from the environmental and anti-violence message Jackson's theatrical edition has strayed. Given the advance complaints from Christopher Lee about the hatcheting of the third film, it might just be best to wait until the extended DVD comes out next Christmas. We'll find out soon enough. A question for Jackson: why would you edit the third film anyway? There is no fourth. Do it right, for a change.
As to this film, as with the first, much of the extra footage fills in details or gives more substance that in the theatre release seemed to be passing nods to cognoscenti who may have brushed up on the book just before curtain. However, there are some critical passages that SHOULD have been in: most notably, ""Sons of the Steward"" segment, the initial capture of Frodo & Sam by Faramir, and most importantly, ""Flotsam and Jetsam."" In the case of the first, the essential dialectic between two sons of a father already unkowingly corrupted by the lure of the ring addresses everything from the literal implications to the endless psychological and family issues involved in the passing of one generation to another, be it business or early onset Alzheimers. But critically to the third film, this scene lays out what is a very key part of the conclusion of the story and why Middle Earth will be forever changed when it passes to men.
As to Frodo's initial capture by Faramir, they come across a fallen opponent and Faramir delivers an oratory that is right at the heart of the tragedy of war, and this is a story borne of a tragedy in Europe in which young men answered calls and found their death. On top of the contextual part, the actuial acting in these two scenes is among the best in the series thus far. Pity. Do we really need more of the ""Guns of Navaronne"" type of film-making? Essentially all war movies are the same: stress in anticpation, catharsis in battle, sacrifice in the aftermath. What changes is the quality of the toys used to display it. That is NOT what the story is about.
The Sons scene deleted also gives depth to Framir's confrontation with Frodo and Sam in the cave and establishes the ethical and the metaphysical reason why he, and not Boromir, should survive and have an important future in Middle Earth.
Many of the other characters are given much more detail as well: Eowyn's part makes sense in this film now. She isn't just Renaissance eye-candy. The Ents are less Disney-like cartoons and actually manage to reel off both Tolkien's interest in lyrical poetry and the Heideggerian question concerning technology and the environment in more than broad pastiche.
And that brings us to Flotsam: much has been made of Jackson's omission of the spider, which, honestly, is a mere dramatic device to advance the story (a more nefarious Tom Bombadill, if you will) that can be quickly addressed in #3. But at the fall of Isengaard, there is an essential confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman that defines the entire conflict that knowledge and power can produce among the knowing and the innocent. In the course of this confrontation, an orb is picked up that has enormous ontological consequences as the story unfolds. It ties in with the entire issue of knowledge, power, corruption and innocence. This is precisely how the movie should have ended, and more's the pity that Jackson took the Jerry Bruckheimer route.
That said, and as the rumours begin to fly about the editing of RETURN OF THE KING, the third film is in danger of going Hollywood. I wept at the end of the books, and I suspect I'll just be full of popcorn with Jackson's resolution of the human factors, the exitential confrontations, the mythological interpretation of death and loss.
This edition is truly what the second film should have been. If you love the story, pick this up.
As to the superfluous material scattered over the other 2 discs, it's mostly for the Mac graphically inclined, but the discussion about Tolkien, featuring notably Christopher Lee, and the New Zealand as Middle Earth segments are terrific. Regarding Tolkien, the various talking heads give you an historical context, but unless you're literate enough to understand the dynamics between Tolkien and C.C. Lewis and even Charles Williams for that matter, this might be lost on the casual viewer. Still, I'm glad it's here. Tends to validate Lee's criticism's of Jackson's editing as well. It would be well to keep in mind that when published, it was ridiculed at Oxford as ""Bored of the Rings"" and actually never really achieved its legendary status until the hippies re-discovered it in the sixties. What began as an academic way of comforting his son in the midst of WW2 inspired so many of us later to be concerned about the very life-stuff of this planet, human and otherwise.",1069459200,4,4922,4.805424528301887

Essential thematic elements from the books - glossed over or entirely ignored in the cinematic release of Two Towers -have been filled in through the previously missing scenes.
It is now on par with the introductory film of the trilogy.  I only find it sad that an epic such as this must be pared down to placate the average theatre-goer's minute attention span.",1069459200,,684,4.590163934426229

The new scenes include a flashback from Faramir, showing his conversations with Boromir. It's nice to see Sean Bean back on screen, reprising his role from The Fellowship of the Ring. Another new scene shows the aftermath of the Ent assault on Isengard.
The added shots are all good. Gollum gets a little extra screen time doing things like trying to eat Lambas bread, gagging on it, and then snatching a fresh worm from the swamp and sucking it down like spaghetti. It's just 20 seconds long, but it adds much more to the overall story.
The four audio tracks and two DVDs of documentary are exhausting and fantastic. As in the extended Fellowship set, the whole crew goes through every stage of filmmaking, from design drawings to editing and mixing the sound. Actors tell their anecdotes for each major scene, Peter Jackson explains nearly every shot of the film, and you get to see how each special effects shot was built and then integrated into the final picture. There are also a few teasers about scenes that were shot and left out, and ideas that were cut before being filmed for various reasons.
This movie was a real labor of love for a huge number of talented artists. It shows in this set of DVDs. Few films are this good, and even fewer are given this kind of complete, detailed, entertaining treatment for fans who can't get enough.",1069459200,,1592,4.73021582733813

Even at over three hours per film, this story is too complex and subtle to be told briefly.  The addition of some of the best material that had to be cut for time considerations in the theatrical release make this practically a different, and far better film.
Assuming the upcoming ""Return of the King"" will maintain these established standards, I expect NewLine's Lord of the Rings will take its place as one of the very best film works ever accomplished, and will set a very high standard to be met for the future.",1069372800,2,643,4.6902654867256635

Like the first box set, it's a first-class packaging job.  I've never seen such pride in preparing DVD packaging.  I hated to open it.  The DVD case itself matches the first extended DVD case perfectly, and they look elegant together on the shelf.  If you have the first extended film, you know what to expect.  Top-grades.  The Gollum DVD case is prepared with equal attention to detail, with an attractive book with lots of drawings about the making of Gollum, along with an accompanying DVD.  This is definitely a step-up from the ""extras"" in the first box set.
The Gollum statue is fine, but not as impressive as the Argonath figures in the first set.  I think this is because the Gollum statue is painted, which makes it appear a little cheaper.  However, the statue captures well the feel of Gollum, and sort of creeps you out.  I found a nice dark nook somewhere in my apartment for him to stare at me and my guests from the shadows.

1458964,5,B00005JKZU,"The theatrical version of the Two Towers was awesome. The drama, the locations, the battles, the performances of the actors, everything. Well, just as was done with the Fellowship of the Ring extended cut, the whole movie gets a huge upgrade from its' already excellent status in this 4 DVD set. There is 45 minutes worth of scenes that were not in the theatrical cut. And they all seem to do one of 4 purposes. 1: Give us more scenes and/or more lines from the book, including an homage to Tom Bombadil by Treebeard. 2: Explain and expand the plot and the characters of the Two Towers to a greater extent. 3: help set up events in the Return of the King much better. 4: add more witty and humurous moments. A perfect example of No. 2 is Faramir. He has some additional scenes towards the start of the second disc that, without giving it away, GREATLY help his character and his characters motivations. I know this was one of the critisisms of the theatrical version, that Faramir was a weak and weightless character. Those who have critized Pete Jackson and Co. for this should really watch this extended cut.
As with the first movie extended cut, the 4 movie commentaries are all fascinating(if VERY time consuming!). The whole set is just awesome. I could ramble on all day about this. Just get it and experience it for yourself!",1069372800,6,1332,4.577405857740586

But the second movie simply redeems the first. First of all unlike FoTR TT preserves the epic tolkien feeling that was in the novel, and the soundtrack is just awesome. Though Eliajah Wood as Frodo still bothers me a bit (by his a la Leonardo di-Caprio appearance, not by acting) I daresay its the best movie I've seen for a very long time. Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf was great, not to mention Chris Lee as Saruman. The style is just epic (no other way to describe it) and the beginning will just left you breathless (as the batlle of Helm's Deep). The whole movie got a slight Warcraft feeling to it but it only adds to the movie. In short: if you want to see a perfect fantazy epic(and you liked the original novel), this movie is just for you.",1069372800,,948,4.392045454545454
1458966,4,B00005JKZU,"Unlike many in this forum, I was quite dissapointed with the theatrical release of the Two Towers. While the cinematography was quite stunning, the first half of the movie felt quite rushed and the changes Jackson, et al, made in the story was quite annoying and unnecessary.
Enter the extended version! Both of my complaints with the theatrical version have been answered. With the extra material, the movie no longer feels rushed. And, with the extra explanation, the alterations are not annoying, as they finally make sense.
Unlike the first movie, there are a few flaws in the extension. The added elven rope and extended Taming of Smeagol scenes feel tacked on. This is due more to the cinematographic differences (rainy, night time versus day) than illogical progression, but the placing of the additions was enough to keep me from losing myself in the story. Fortunately, these scenes are short and near the beginning.
The second flaw is far more subtle. As one of the added scenes merges into older content, the entire sound track goes blank for about a second, highlighting the fact that there is new content. As this flaw happens in the change of a scene, it may be a DVD flaw that is not present in the film. Engrossed in the film at the time, it was jarring to me.
Things to really like:
* The hobbit's escape from capture flows.
* The Ent's decision to go to war feels natural, not forced.
* Theoden's human side shows quite a bit more
* You better understand the nature of Aragorn, as one of the last of the Dnedain. While this still does not explain his near superman quality (being blown hundreds of feet in the air and getting back up to fight), it at least adds a level of plausibility.
* The elves' aid at Helm's Deep makes more sense.
* Faramir's character begins to shine, which will be more important in Return of the King.
* A crucial set up for ROTK is set up with Merry and Pippin (will not spoil for those who have not read the books).
In addition, there are some fun scenes that many avid LOTR fans have been waiting for, like the Ent Draft scene. While this does not necessarily add much to the story line, the added scenes do give a bit more depth to the characters.
Much like the Fellowship extended, the extra material lacks a certain amount of production quality. The material is excellent, however, for those who want to know more about both the original story and the film.
I am torn with 4 and 5 stars with this review and wish I could give 4.5. While I am definitely a fan, there are a couple of flaws that make it hard for me to give it a perfect score.",1069372800,5,2590,4.454736842105263
1459052,5,B00005JKZU,"I liked the theatrical version of ""The Two Towers."" That being said, the Extended Edition is definitely a stronger, more consistent film. It tightens up so many of the loose ends, and gave more reason for some of the changes made from the books. From Eowyn's heartfelt singing at Theodred's funeral procession to Merry and Pippin's extended roles to Faramir's siginificantly more defined character, the new scenes add to the story and to the character development dramatically. The plot flows better in general, and my wife's comment upon seeing the new material was ""It makes sense now!"" That sums it up pretty well.
The DVD extras (on Discs 3 and 4) live up to the high standard set by the Extended Edition of ""Fellowship of the Ring."" We get to see some of the technical wizardry in the creation of Gollum, and we get insights into the massive amounts of creative energy expended on crafting this grand film, including the reasoning behind changing key elements of the books.  What is abundantly clear in each presentation is that everyone involved in making these films is passionately devoted to doing it well, ad no decisions were made haphazardly. It's so rare to find DVD extras that live up to the film they accompany, but the extras on the set definitely do so admirably. And be sure to keep your eyes open for a couple of great easter eggs!
When it comes to the films themselves, ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was different. The theatrical release was very good, and the Extended Edition was very good. Some of the individual scenes in the ""Fellowship"" Extended Edition were cut better, but overall I like both versions equally, for different reasons. For ""The Two Towers,"" it really seems like the Extended Edition is the better film. Diehard Tolkien fans or movie fans who never read the books should both enjoy the Extended Edition more.",1069372800,4,1846,4.80503144654088
1459053,5,B00005JKZU,"I never saw the short version, and don't intend to, so this is strictly about the extended version.  I have two complaints about pointless deviations from the book; one, the way the ents made up their mind, and two the side trip with Faramir.
Well, so what, because all the characters are present and pretty much faithfully execute the general themes.  I have no objections to side issues like what the heck were the elves doing at Helm's Deep and so forth.  It's a movie, not the book, I've managed to live with that concept quite comfortably.
And what a movie!  Like I said, I don't know about the theatrical version, but this one is an excellent two-night experience, exciting and interesting throughout.  I really liked some of the stuff not covered in the book, like the flashback with Boromir and Faramir, that was really good.  And I thought the Arwen twist combined with the possible earthly Aragorn/Eowyn connection was a good plot element to add.  No objections at all, I found all the elvish chat with Elrond most entertaining.
Oh yeah, Brad Dourif is perfect as Grima, played that to the hilt.  Maybe more ""name"" actors would have been better in some of the roles, they are known for a reason, they are good at their craft, as Dourif illustrated well.
Petty, petty complaints.  This is wonderful stuff.  I'll look forward next year to the last extended set!",1069286400,3,1369,4.690376569037657
1459054,4,B00005JKZU,"MOVIE - 5 STARS; COMPANION DVD'S - 4 STARS
*SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**
When I first heard that the elves would be at Helm's Deep in the Two Towers, I, like many others, was outraged.  When I saw the completed theatrical release, I realized something.  Helm's Deep would have been a total wash for the world of men if they didn't have good archers on that battlement.  The difference in the media of print and film makes some changes necessary.  Of course it reads well without the elves, but when one actually sees that battle, the viewer's perspective is necessarily changed.
A lot of that happens with the new and extended scenes in this DVD set.  Some of it is extremely unnecessary for the telling of the story, but relates the tale in different perspectives.  For instance, the added scene between Eowyn and Aragorn gives you Aragorn's age and reminds the viewer that he is not of the normal race of men.  Reading the book, the reader cannot forget this unless they put the book down for a year.  I must say, Viggo Mortensen has aged well.
The companion dvds are a bit of a disappointment.  The same interviews and statements are repeated throughout.  There is some new info, though.  At least it was new to me.  The guy who trained the stunt persons in swordplay was Erroll Flynn's stunt double.  The guy looks amazing for his age.  I guess foiling and swordplay keep one in shape.
One really great thing -- the Easter Egg on this dvd set is in the same place as on the FOTR dvd.  Go to select a scene on the first dvd.  Go to the last scene and hit ""down"" one more time so that ""new scene"" is highlighted.  Hit ""play"".  It's Andy Serkis'/Gollum's acceptance speech at the 2003 MTV movie awards.  I've never laughed so hard in my life.",1069286400,7,1775,4.542586750788644

Is there something special about how the second two discs are recorded?
Oh, and the review, the movie was great, except for the protrayal of Faramir and bringing Frodo and Sam to Gondor.  That could have been cut to be consistent with the book.",1069286400,5,530,4.333333333333333
1459056,2,B00005JKZU,"Warning: To all possible buyers of this extended version.  I loved the first exented version DVD of the Fellowship of the Ring. I felt differently about the Two Towers. I was thoroughly disappointed with Peter Jackson's choice to include these extra scenes that were simply deleted scenes reinserted into the storyline when the pacing, story, and narrative flow were much better in the theatrical version. Imagine the first scene: Gandolf is falling to the pit after the dragon. Cut to a scene with Sam and Frodo climbing down a cliff, Sam drops something, Frodo catches it. Frodo asks, ""What was that Sam?"" Sam replies that it was some seasoning from home and he misses the shire. Seasoning? Very anti-climactic. Imagine the end the of the film. The war in helm's deep has ended. Sam has just made his amazing speech about the beautiful stories that he heard as a young hobbit. Gandolf should be about to say, ""The battle for Helm's Deep has ended; the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin."" Instead we cut to a scene were Merry and Pippin are in the flood around Saroman's tower discovering a room full of food and smoking tobacco and wondering whether they should share it with the Ent. Some would say that the added scenes add information to the plot. They sometimes do add some background, but at the expense of a nearly ridiculous or uneventful scene. When editing a movie one asks, what is the purpose of this scene? How does it help forward the plot? None of the added scenes forwarded the plot or added to the film in such a valuable way as to merit their inclusion. The original was fast paced, exciting, dramatic. The extended version is whimsical and disappointing, better suited for a child-audience (because it has more off the collar comic relief, and makes sure everyone, I mean everyone, really understands everything 100% - even if it means repetition). The first theatrical cut made me feel I was watching an epic. The extended version made me feel I was watching a movie. A movie that needed editing.

1459060,5,B00005JKZU,"What is the task at hand?  I've already expounded upon this recently in referring to The Two Towers.  I will attempt it one more time with some help from the ""Nay-sayers"" and my own observations.
The task at hand is reviewing a DVD containing a story as told in visual media.  Does the story hold up? Does the vision of the Director make the story accessible to the viewer and create tension, provoke reaction, and lead the viewer to a satisfactory conclusion? Has the story successfully conveyed some message?  This is a very subjective question depending upon individual interpretation of what was seen and experienced.
None of the above questions or observations that can be made in answer to them HAVE A DAMNED THING TO DO WITH SOME BOOK WRITTEN BEFORE IT!!!!  So there!  I am a huge Tolkein fan, read them all in the late sixties and again in the 70's and 90's (twice) and what Peter Jackson has accomplished here is to very successfully wring pathos, excitement, mystery, fear, despair, HOPE, need, desire, faith, and so much more from the story.  So an unqualified yes to the above questions may be inserted here:
We must always remember: One has on an average 20-50 hours of concentrated reading to enjoy Tolkein's story, and a difficult story at that.  On film it is just not possible to rely upon purely literary modes of exposition and plot development to move the characters and move the viewer.  1) It would take decades to make. 2) It would cost BILLIONS to make.  3) It would cost time and money the viewer can ill afford to see it.  4) It would FAIL miserably as a story by being overburdned with too much for the viewer to have to remember in so short a time.
I can go on and on but will refrain from burdening my possible readers.  Some salient points however can be construed.  My favorite damnation of the film is when I hear YOU sickeningly zealous Tolkein psychophants rant on about Faramir.  Whiningly lamenting his altered character.  This is the only topic I'll broach here.
Faramir was perhaps an ancilliary character Tolkein put in to expand upon his views of virtue and nobility of spirit.  He was a devout Catholic much troubled by his experiences in the first World War and his writing was as much an exorcism of demons as it was a celebration of what he believed good in the world.  Faramir as a character works in the book as an expository character for virtue and nobility of spirit however, in the film that same characterization would make him pointless.  The story of Faramir as told in the film makes a good tension builder and obstacle to the quest.  Without this we loose Faramir altogether so, YOU ridiculously pompous and self adulatory purist snobs SHUT UP and be thankful he's there at all.  He really isn't necessary to the actual story either written or filmed.
In closing I must invite a fellow reviewer to be taken to hand for his own comments.  However passionate, and that is a virtue, and however critical in a negative or positive way we are as critics/reviewers, there is ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE for foul or purely derrogatory language directed at the artist!  Seriously Mr. ""Garythemessage"" (notice I capitalized your nickname) you should be flayed alive and hung for the buzzards.  Do you honestly think you're some kind of avenging angel from heaven, some Jeanne d'Arc of Tolkein purists?  Perhaps with a nickname like ""messengersomesuchtripe"" that is truly what you believe and I for one will stand by your side and defend you from attack for voicing your opinions, however I do not hold with your filthy bastardization of Mr. Peter Jackson's name.  And, in sooth I will politely disagree with your studied and somewhat banal criticism as I feel you don't really understand the depths of which you write.  I invite you to write me.

The extra footage highlights:
- additional ent footage, including a discussion of the entwives
- a lot of stuff with Grima, Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer that really enhanced that story line.
- the back story with Faramir & Boromir was also very informative

Let me just say that some people were not responding to the ""Platinum Series Special Extended Edition"", which does NOT come with the bookends, gollum statue, and making of the gollum statue. (Consequently, it is 1/2 the price though as well.) Criticism on the ""making of the gollum statue"" should not be attached to this edition.
All of the extended scenes are marvellous! The story is more fleshed out and better-prepared. The best movie is made even better! As I know what is coming in Return of the King (not the movie, but the story), let me just say that it was very refreshing to see additional foreshadowing. The Treebeard/Merry/Pippen storyline is fleshed out a lot more. The threat Aragorn poses to Sauron is better-developed. All of this is good preparation for the third film! And you get more of Howard Shore's seamlessly brilliant music. Gotta see this extended version!
As for the person who had 3rd and 4th discs that do not work, they are merely defective discs (which happens in all movies to a small percentage of discs)--exchange it where you bought it from and you will have working 3rd and 4th discs. The 3rd and 4th discs, though I have not seen it all yet, have clips from Return of the King as well (just enough to be a teaser), and a great tribute to J. R. R. Tolkien. Note that all of the features are completely different than those for the Fellowship's extended edition. I can comment on the ones I have seen: the aspects of JRR Tolkien's life that are discussed are different, as is the writing of the script. So do not fear about getting duplicate material on the third and fourth discs either! All of the material is just awesome! Where is the 6-star rating for those few exceptional movies?!

When the first ""you must be a nerd to get this edition"" gift set came out it was fairly cool. The national geographic special was cool and the book ends were neat because I can stack all my lord of the rings DVDs on the shelf between them.
With this edition you get a Gollum statue and a DVD on HOW THE GOLLUM STATUE WAS MADE! Yes.. wonderful idea... I am so interested in polystone statue work. I was thinking of quitting my job and selling little statues like this at renaissance festivals for the rest of my life so this DVD has the perfect timing. Personally, I don't think stone craft got enough attention in this multi million dollar trilogy. In fact, they should have made the entire movie about some guy in a cheap workshop carving a statue instead of all this ""the ring must be destroyed"" nonsense. Maybe the Two Towers would have been successful if they had done that instead of only making the paltry sum it made in the theatre. I know I've already lost a few people so let me say that THIS IS SARCASM.

This DVD is worth it for the extras alone. As before the wealth and ease of extras, including  the casual, friendly manner in which they are introduced, make the viewer feel welcome and satied with info. No stone goes unturned, as it were. Nothing feels left out.
The film itself, however, carries over 40 minutes of extra footage. Only a third, in my opinion, make the film better. The rest are either extraneous, irritating or (in one scene) downright embarrassing. It's a scattershot effort. I would have preferred a selection of deleted scenes among the extras that were filmed but didn't work at all, and the addition of only 15-20 minutes of the better footage would have been, for me, a better choice. It is clear (and the creators admit) that TTT got the short end of the narrative stick...and it shows.

Besides the original nearly three hour film, this edition includes just over 43 minutes of footage that was not shown in the original cinematic release.  I realize why some of the scenes were not included in the movie, but some of the other ones I just don't understand: they add such depth to the movie and make it better than it was. Since the series has been such a success, I don't think audiences would have minded at all to have 15 or 20 minutes of these deleted scenes in the original release since it flushes out the film and characters so much more.
Anyway, if you sit down and watch all of the extras included with this set, it will take you about 2 1/2 weeks to get through it.  There are four commentaries to accompany the film, thirteen documentaries, maps, thousands of images and stills and sketches, and a whole lot more.  For around $30, it is more than worth the price and makes a great gift for any LORD OF THE RINGS fan.  Here's to the journey!",1069200000,5,1091,4.381188118811881

What the film makers have done is a take a great film and made it BETTER! Great, in fact. With an addition 43 min. worth of film what we get is more character development, more explainations into major plot points, and old characters doing new things! More Gollum, more Treebeard, more Faramir, and more of the Fellowship's journey. Simply Amazing! Also the bonus material is well worth your time! It is amazing to see the care, sweat, and tears that the film makers put into these films.
GO OUT AND BUY THIS NOW! If you are a fan of the series, GET IT NOW! If you are not, do yourself a favor, get this and the Fellowship of the Ring: Expanded Edition as well! You'll get two wonderful films that are truly epic in size!
Bring on RETURN OF THE KING!!!

It's hard to imagine how a movie like Lord Of The Rings could be made better. And I haven't even looked at the extras yet!
This DVD set puts other DVD ""special editions"" to shame. If you're hesitant to buy this one, let me assure you, you won't regret it. If you enjoyed The Two Towers at the movies, you'll absolutely love this extended edition, as it really fleshes out the story, as well as providing a few very pleasant surprises.

1459276,5,B00005JKZU,"Although I have watched the original 'The Two Towers' many times, I was enthralled by the extended version. So many of the side stories are brought to life here that one wonders how the film managed without them. Merry and Pip and the entwater are real entertainment; Frodo and Sam and the elvin rope really illustrate the elves gifts; some parts of Aragorn's background and skills are introduced. Best of all is to see the forest which moved to Helm's Deep to slaughter the orcs. That to me is an essential part of the story.  I shall watch this version again and again.",1069200000,3,571,4.543689320388349
1459277,5,B00005JKZU,"Although the theatrical version was very good, the Special Extended Edition of The Two Towers (TTT) blows it out of the water.
As with Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR), director Peter Jackson doesn't just tack on an extra 40 minutes.  Sometimes it's a different camera angle (for instance, watch for one during the Urak-Hai ""I smell man flesh..."" scene), or a new scene is added which perfectly segues into another scene (the theatrical version often seemed choppy at some points), or a scene is extended just long enough to give greater depth to it (see the above-mentioned Urak-Hai scene).
The sound quality is phenomenal.  One of the things my husband complained about the theatrical version is that the sound seemed drowned out.  Not a problem with this!  In the opening scene of Gandalf and the Balrog falling into the abyss, you can hear the crackling of the fire as if it were lit on your living room floor!
New flashbacks are used judiciously, especially one concerning Faramir.  It explains a lot about Faramir's motivations, whereas the theatrical version glossed over it.
I've only looked at a couple of the extras, and they were well thought out and interesting.  One is a documentary on Tolkien by writers as to where the origins of Middle Earth came from (and they talk about his literary style as well); another was editorial decisions on TTT.  The editorial documentary is a bit long, but you can get some idea of what went into the decisions to cut what scenes, which takes to use, etc.
The DVDs are in a box (naturally), this time in dark brown (while FOTR was in green).  The scene drawn on the back is of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn meeting someone in Fangorn Forest...
All in all, a splendid job, making a very good movie into a fantastic one!  Buy it - you won't regret it!",1069200000,7,1792,4.663492063492064
1459278,5,B00005JKZU,"This is the movie Jackson wanted to release in the theaters, but couldn't.  And people who just see the theatrical version don't know what they are missing.  The added scenes do so much to flesh out other bits of the story (including much-needed characterization of Faramir).  The first few added scenes with Sam and Frodo are excellent: they really show the relationship developed in the FotR, and you understand the burden the ring is putting on Frodo when he lashes out at Sam later in the film.  It is just subtle touches like that which make me wait each year to invest in the extended edition rather than the theatrical.
The Gollum statue is finely crafted, and nicely detailed.  I have yet to watch the ""Making of the statue"" DVD which comes with the gift set, but the book of Gollum sketches is really neat.
If I hadn't pre-ordered this back in August, it would be first on my Christmas list this year :) I can't wait to have all 3 volumes standing in my argonath bookends.....",1069200000,2,985,4.5423728813559325
1459279,5,B00005JKZU,"I received my special extended version of The Two Towers yesterday, after waiting for months, and I can vouch that it is well worth the wait.  Like the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, this version of The Two Towers enhances the theatrical release and far more fully reveals the faithfulness of Peter Jackson's vision to Tolkien's creation.  This is not to say that there aren't plenty of plot variations, some merely unfortunate (Aragorn's flirtatiousness with Eowyn) and others grating (the constant stream of Dwarf jokes). But the spirit and atmosphere of this movie must be the closest approximation possible to what Tolkien himself would have filmed, had he had the chance and the inclination to do so.
First, the extra material that comes with this special gift edition.  The statuette of Smeagol/Gollum is very nice and detailed, right down to the fish which looks to be still dripping wet. This turns out to be one half of a pair of bookends, and you are given information on how to order the other half (for about 80 bucks).  With the statuette comes an extra DVD on the Weta workshop which produced it.  There's some interesting material about how such things are made, but much of the program is really a commercial for Weta's products.
The actual extended version comes in a nice red leather-bookish looking case which folds out to display the four DVDs, two with the movie and two appendices with extra material.  A folder provides a road map or overview so you can quickly find your way to sections of interest.  There are many interviews with producers and actors and lots of pictures of sets, slideshows of sketch drawings of characters, and the like.  One particularly interesting section shows how the drowning of Isengard was planned using bunches of twigs, construction paper, tissue, and old rags. (You can do a side by side comparison here with a splitscreen showing the scene from the movie along with the planning video, which is quite interesting).
As for the movie itself, a fine film in theatrical release has now been turned into a masterpiece.  Scene after scene has been added or extended, and every addition and extension lends depth and beauty.  I'm particularly glad to see a nice nod to Tom Bombadil in the Fangorn segments.  Its the wrong book but at least some of him got into the movie after all.  Long time Tolkien fans, like me, will watch this film with continued shocks of delight as material pops up again and again that echoes the written word.  New Tolkien fans, or those who are only familiar with the movies, will find  much more to enjoy and gain a much better understanding of the history and cultures of the peoples and lands being depicted.  I won't go into too much detail here for fear of spoiling the surprises.
When Peter Jackson's film project was announced I was filled with trepidation lest these books, which I have loved since the age of 12 in 1969, would be forever cheapened.  I am now no longer so concerned, for while the films don't live up to the books (an impossible task), they have clearly been made with loving attention to detail and a niggling desire for perfection that matches Tolkien's own.  Buy this version of The Two Towers, along with the extended Fellowship of the Ring, and then watch and wait impatiently for The Return of the King to complete the vision.",1069200000,5,3351,4.740103270223752
1459280,5,B00005JKZU,"Words cannot express how great this version is. The extra forty-three minutes enhances the story in a way I'd have never thought possible, and helps Faramir's case greatly. The theatrical becomes obsolete, this one is so vastly superior.",1069200000,4,237,5.2631578947368425
1459281,3,B00005JKZU,"Yes, the look of Middle Earth as portrayed by Jackson is stunning and perfect.  The casting, costuming, sets, etc. are perfect.  This whole production of the greatest trilogy in the history of literature (can even Dante compare?)came so close... so close... and yet, so far away.  Bad enough the stuff about Aragorn being a reluctant king (not in the books!)  Bad enough that Gimli becomes a comic figure.  Bad enough that Frodo & Co. end up kidnapped to Osgiliath by Faramir.  But then, when Frodo  ascends the parapet (really bad cut here; we don't see him begin the ascent, but suddenly he's up there) and then the nazgul rises before him... what does Frodo do?  He shows the Ringwraith the Ring!  And this is Peter's Stunning Error.  Earth to Peter ---  Show's Over!
Once the Ringwraiths know where the ring is, what is the purpose of everything that comes after?  Aragon's tussle with Sauron via the palantir is meaningless.  Sauron knows who has the ring; Frodo showed it to a Ringwraith!  The battle of Pellenor fields is meaningless.  Every feint and subterfuge of Gandalf and Co. is meaningless.  Sauron knows where the ring is (unless you want to be so dimwitted as to assume that the Wraiths don't communicate with Sauron regarding the chief goal of his existence)!
.  Oh well  Maybe fifty years from now, somebody will take a better shot at it, with even better technology.  I won't be here for it.  Or maybe Peter will wake up, reshoot the Faramir scenes, dump the trip to Osgiliath, and put Shelob back where she belongs at the end of the Two Towers, then re-release a new version.  Like I said... so close, and yet so far away.
BTW, the little statuette of Gollum is very well done and carries the WEDA imprimatur of quality.  I'm very glad to have it.  However, it's a real BEAR to get out of the package!",1069200000,4,1821,4.586956521739131
1459282,4,B00005JKZU,"Having watched both extended films back-to-back, we escaped to Middle-Earth for more than six hours.  With the second film, I had hoped Peter Jackson had rectified some errors from The Two Towers -- which we had only seen thrice when compared to the dozen times we watched Fellowship in movie theaters.
I felt a great thrill throughout the first disc, because it followed the quality set by Fellowship's extended edition.  Frodo and Sam receive a better introduction.  Smeagol-Gollum plays more with pathos, although I miss his 'origin' story.
Who could argue with scenes for Gandalf and Eomer, reduced to walk-ons during the theatrical cut?  Initially, Treebeard shows decisiveness - In the text, he does not need 'convincing' to fight Saruman.  My hopes were buoyed when disc one ended.
However, the second disc contains the same elements that discouraged me from returning to see The Two Towers.  Arwen's tearful scenes with Elrond were romantic padding then and now. I feel Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn has little chemistry with Liv Tyler's Arwen.  I concede the necessity for Peter Jackson to bring love interest, but this subplot grows very tiresome.
I feel more narrative should have been provided to explain the coming of Haldir.  Instead, we have Galadriel's token voiceover playing through recycled footage.  I know there had to be one scene from Lorien cut from the original -- where did it go?
Helm's Deep actually suffers from poor editing.  One scene shows Aragorn plummeting from the scaling ladder, yet within seconds, he's already at the gates with King Theoden.  I also quibble with King Theoden's unwillingness to fight openly -- much like Treebeard, he is largely reduced to a passive character.
On the subject of the Ents, the new scenes built me up for a reinvigorated Entmoot, but aside from some whimsical scenes with Merry and Pippin, it's the same result.  Peter Jackson really missed a chance to follow Tolkien more closely for the fans.
Faramir receives much-needed development, but I never doubted David Wenham was the right actor.  His actions in the film make more sense, given his relationship to Boromir and Denethor -- another fine cast with John Noble.  Nonetheless, I still dispute Frodo's scene with the Nazgul -- wouldn't this have alerted Sauron to send the remaining Ringwraiths to Osgiliath?
The Two Towers extended edition benefits from sweeping camera angles, clearer characterizations of the Rohirrim, and the solid production values.  However, Middle-Earth does not mesh well with Hollywood, and the cracks are beginning to show.  7/10",1069200000,5,2577,5.158653846153846
1459283,5,B00005JKZU,"The ""Lord of the Rings"" movies collectively represent the most amazing cinematic feat of at least the past decade.  Period.  The extended edition of ""The Two Towers"" continues a beautiful tradition that began last year with the extended ""Fellowship"" release, and is starting to make me wish that Peter Jackson wouldn't have to bother with creating 3-hour theatrical cuts that are quickly (and gladly) forgotten when his more expansive and complete extended cuts get released on DVD!  These 4-disc editions really immerse you in J.R.R. Tolkien's amazing and beautifully-realized world, and make you truly never want to leave!  If only all movies could be made with such vision, love, and dedication as these have been.
This Collector's Gift Set for ""The Two Towers"" is every bit as gorgeous and enjoyable as last year's ""Fellowship"" Gift Set was, although the bonus ""Gollum"" DVD is, somewhat sadly, little more than a 30-minute advertisement for Slideshow Weta's line of ""Lord of the Rings"" figures and sculptures.  However, the companion book (""Creating Gollum"") is a nice collection of stories from Gollum's cinematic creators, and it features a wonderful evolution of sketches, sculptures, and digital images to illustrate how the little monster was so effectively brought to life in the movie.  It's particularly interesting to get a look at all the Gollums that could have been, as I'd felt that Gollum was perhaps a bit TOO human in ""The Two Towers"" (an opinion which was probably left over from my vision of him from the old animated ""Hobbit"" movie).
Mainly, I'd like to know if any other fans out there have purchased this set and, like myself, are having serious problems removing the too-cool ""Gollum as Smeagol"" statue from the packaging without completely destroying said packaging.  Because it really is too nice a set to have to tear apart!  If anyone has found an easier way to accomplish this, please feel free to email me and let me know.

It really expands on all the thoughts (2/3 of the movie has been changed with either extensions or completely new scenes).
WARNING:  This movie is just short of 4 hours, and therefore is very hard to sit though without taking a break.

1459447,5,B00005JKZU,"At last we have the extended edition of The Two Towers. It was certainly worth the wait. Those of us who bought the extended version of Fellowship of the Ring know what to expect. A superior, richer version of the film and enough bonus features for ten movies. And that's exactly what we get. The extended version of The Two Towers improves on an already great film. The difference is not huge, but fans of the book will certainly appreciate the added detail. Most appreciated, in my opinion, is the extended finale which I think works much better than the abbreviated end of the theatrical film. The events following the Battle of Helm's Deep are greatly fleshed out in this version. I also loved the new scene with Merry and Pippin discovering Saruman's storehouse at Isengard. I loved all the new and extended scenes, and feel that the story is greatly enriched by them.
Obviously, the extended version is going to be the one to own for fans, but it's good that the theatrical version is available also. Casual viewers may find the film's 223-minute running time a bit daunting. However, if you watch it in two parts, it's not difficult at all to sit through. For anyone who loves these films, the Extended Edition is an essential purchase. These are quite simply the most comprehensive DVD collections that have ever been produced.

1459449,5,B00005JKZU,"First off, for those so-called ""purists"", I remember specifically in the Special Edition of FOTR that Peter Jackson stated that he and his entire crew wanted to make a movie ""based"" on Tolkien's masterpiece that would be suitable for those that have read the books and for those that have not yet done so and still stay true to the overall story. He has done that in my honest opinion.
Therefore, in the scenes where Merry and Pippin meet up with the White Wizard, and when Aragorn falls off the cliff, the movie leaves the viewers who have not read the books in a state of suspense. It keeps their attention and adds some adventure to the movie. For those of us that have read the books, we know what the outcome will be. To me, there is nothing wrong with this at all. The overall story has NOT been changed.
Peter Jackson's goal was to create a movie that would hopefully bring in even more fans to read the books and to introduce them to what JRR Tolkien had worked so hard to create: a world with it's own history, languages and people that pulls the reader in and makes them forget about the real world for a few hours. Peter Jackson has done that with his rendition of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It stays faithful to the overall story, which is the quest for the one ring, and it's destruction. Unfortunately, the purists are selfish in their feelings, but they are in the minority here.
In this extended version of the Two Towers, new scenes have been added while others have been extended. Over 200 new visual effects were added and Howard Shore once again has redone the musical score as they did for the extended version of FOTR.
The appendices are excellent. The appendices in the FORT and the Two Towers are examples of how DVD's should be put together. Hours upon hours of behind the scenes documentaries exist that are not slapped together, but put into a logical order. As with the FOTR, you have the option to play all of them together with one press on your remote or to watch them separately at your leisure.
The Map of Middle Earth is back to show the continuation of the journeys of the broken Fellowship, which to me is a wonderful tool. I know that once I got into the Two Towers and ROTK in the books, I had a hard time following where the events were taking place and where everyone was traveling. Those questions have been answered with this DVD.
Also, there is a hidden Easter egg on the first DVD of the movie with Gollum and the MTV awards that is hilarious. Not as funny as the SNL skit on FOTR, but still hilarious. If you found the Easter eggs on the extended version of FOTR, then you'll know how to get it on the Two Towers.
I'm eagerly awaiting the final chapter, interested in seeing how Peter Jackson has transferred the book to film. So far, I must say he has done a commendable job. I felt that the theatrical version of the Two Towers telling of the various stories seemed almost too short and slapped together. I think it's because so much of the story had to be left out that fleshed out the details, especially with Treebeard and the Ents. However, more of that story has now been added to this special extended version and this, like the FOTR extended version, is surely going to please the rest of us even more than the original theatrical version.
This movie rates 5 stars in my book. It's an awesome adventure that I can watch again and again.",1069113600,,3394,4.406050955414012
1459450,5,B00005JKZU,"I am a Tolkien Purist.  I've read the books religiously for the last 15 years and I have to say that while there are changes, this is the most faithful to the books that I have ever seen an adaptation, while still making it available to people who would never have the patience to slog through Tolkien's admittedly amateur writing style.
I was a little bit stunned when I saw it in theaters about the massive changes that Jackson and his team put into the books.  The movie didn't suffer for them, but I was incredibly dissapointed.  The extended edition scenes helped to explain all of it, and the appendices take that even further.
I will not spoil this for you here, but if you are a purist who wants desparatly to like this movie, you have to see this extended cut.  The movie is far better explained with it, and the appendices explain much of the reasoning behind the changes, which as a writer myself I have to admit are understandable.  Don't cheat yourself out of a wonderful movie for a few elves and a personality change.  Sit back and let Jackson and his team take you through their magic.

The extras are amazing, especially ""From Book to Script"" where Boyens discusses the changes between (duh) the book and the movie.

This movie is overwhelming. It takes you from the depths of the forest to the highest mountain top.
You really cant imagine how they were able to make some of the scenes, such as the war scene, look so real.
The good thing about this movie is that its not a hollywood flick. Its not Lord of the Rings starring Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise. The film tries to stay as true as they can to the story itself. Allthough a ew changes are neccesary becouse we don't have time to watch a 10 hour movie.
In the end its a great visual ride through Middle Earth, with good visual effects and good acting. Enjoy it, but if you have read the book then dsont expect it to be exactly like the book.

1459595,5,B00005JKZU,"The extended version of The Two Towers doesn't feel quite as essential as The Fellowship of The Ring. Like the first set, The Two Towers shows us a couple of complete sequences previously unseen or referred to in passing.
Like the first set, the film is broken up over two discs. The picture isn't flawless but its pretty darn close. There's few digital compression artifacts and the sound is spectacular. The extras are spread over all four discs (with the most important extras on discs 1 & 2 being the commentary tracks from the director and cast). What's really fascinating is getting a look at the production techniques to make The Two Towers capture Jackson's vision of Tolkien's world. Also, allowing the director and his co-writers a voice on why the alterations to the plot were necessarily gives these changes added credibility. It's difficult when you're a hardcore fan of any work of literature to give it up to another person's vision. Although some fans were disappointed with the changes in the story, I felt that they enhanced the story and expanded the scope of Tolkien's original vision in a cinematic way.
The packaging is a bit more problematic. While I liked the packaging design(it's in a similar package to the first edition), the set I received had some tears on it. The edition of The Fellowship I received had similar problems with it tearing fairly easy but that's a very minor point overall. The design is the thing here and it's designed quite well.
Overall, The Two Towers extended edition is still superior when compared to the theatrical cut although the difference between it and the extended edition isn't quite as large as what existed between the two versions of Fellowship. As a middle chapter, Towers has a number of disadvantages but the main one is that we come in on the middle of the story and there isn't a strong sense of closure to the film. Nevertheless, it's still a compelling and powerful film that proves that Jackson's work on The Frighteners and other works wasn't a fluke.",1068854400,,2025,4.788571428571428
1459596,5,B00005JKZU,"Too many people have chosen to place Peter's Film in the rhelm of incomplete or unparallel with the book. I think this is a mistake, brought about by a fear of others assuming a different view on the trilogy than their own. They perhaps even fear having changed what is dear to them in their minds and hearts, after having read the trilogy. But to read with meaning and reason is to read while guessing at the untold, to be inspired by what is not written. A perfect example of this is the travels of Gandulf ""on paths that I will not tell"" after his debacle with the Balrog. If your read with intent, you would try to imagine in your minds eye, what Gandulf saw and did during these ""life-ages of the world"". There are many aspects of the film which, I believe, heighten and articulate the entire Tolkien experience for the true fan. Years ago I watched Mr. B's adaptation of the RINGS with some enthusiasm, but was disgusted by its sequel, a childs' version of the Two Towers and Return mixed together. Ah, youth. Then and recently in life I dreamed of the day when a film producer would set the story to 'reel' screen. Twelve years ago friends and fans alike would tell me that setting the book to film was too monumental a task, though in my heart I never accepted this. I always told myself that if I was a millionaire I would hire people to help me make the film myself, in another life of course. I loved the first film, from Bilbo's home gate to the elven boats used along the Anduin river. I am very excited about the third and final film. I am excited to add to my collection of thought and memory concerning a master writer and literary genius -J.R.R. Tolkien.  Enjoy the movie for what it is, read a little more, accept that we all have differences of opinion, bringing futher inclination towards art in the first place. Bombadil is a bit of a sacred fellow and should not be portrayed in the films anyway, as would be Tolkien's wish I suspect - please read the History of The Lord of The Rings , vol. 1-10 and you will find the answer to Tom's purpose - we must not yet bring the Silmarillion to the silver screen, this should not be done. Enjoy the film movie fans, I sure did.",1068854400,,2191,4.317961165048544

For all of you out there that are critical of the movies because they take license with the books content, then too bad.

1459746,5,B00005JKZU,"At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material.  It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.
I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.:  Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.
But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the ""ring"" itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me!  In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the ""eye"" when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and uses it deliberately to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring.  In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.
Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King.",1068768000,7,2027,4.7175141242937855

1459752,3,B00005JKZU,"I know I will be labled a purist and told to just relax and enjoy the movie, but I can't!  I tried, but every horrible decision to deviate from the book wrenched me outside of the movie.  And besides the deviations there were many scenes just put in to Hollywoodize the movie.  A list of my complaints in no specific order -- 1. Legolas riding the shield ""skateboard style""!  Give me a break.  How X-treme sports can you get?  Legolas walking on top of the snow, or flipping up on a horse, or walking on the cave troll's chain, yes!, but shield boarding, NO!  2. Gimli as comic relief.  Why?  Gimli would have found a nice vantage point at Helm's Deep.  He wouldn't have complained about running long distances.  He was a noble dwarf, not a bumbling moron!  3.  Aragorn falling off the cliff.  Why?  Talk about causing a log jam in the stream of the movie!  I thought the changes were made to make things move more movie-like.  If they wanted the dream of Arwen, people do dream while they sleep, and Eowyn can still look longingly  at Aragorn from afar to show she loves him.  And even non-readers of the book knew he was alive and felt no tension, so Legolas and Gimli's sadness rang hollow.  4.  The Ents.  Yes I loved their attack on Helm's Deep, but they were misrepresented completely before that.  They are the tree herders. They know when the forest is being cut down!!  And why didn't the Entmoot decide to attack Orthanc?  So the hobbits could show how cunning they are?  Uh, lets go this way, duh!  And then suddenly all the Ents in Middle Earth just pour out of Fangorn?  Treebeard had to walk miles to get there, and I thought they knew nothing of the destruction Saruman was causing.  5. Gollum's split personality.  Others might say this is just a natural extension of the book and they may be right, but when Gollum and Smeagol were having their conversation I lost all believablity.  He never cast out his Gollum side.  His personality struggled with good and evil, but that was who he was, not Sybyll.  6. Well, the most painful part of the movie was of course Faramir.  Okay, Faramir taking Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath externalized the struggle.  Good actors don't need that to happen!  Faramir studied under Gandalf.  He knew!!!!  Yes, he wanted to do right for Gondor, but he knew the ring was not right.  And taking them to Osgiliath just causes another break in their journey and they STILL haven't crossed into Mordor!  Nothing happened in TTT. A big battle, yee haa!  7.  The Elves at Helm's Deep.  Yeah, they are cool, but is that the only reason to put them there?  Elrond not giving up on Man is lost on me.  And Haldir Lives!!  8. Frodo holding the ring up the Nazgul.  Uh, that Nazgul sure gave up easy.  9.  Sam's sappy speech that changed Faramir's mind.  Too painful to watch.  10.  Galadriel's speech in the middle to catch us up.  I am watching the movie.  I don't need your help.  I would rather had PJ come on screen to apologize for turning The Two Towers into a hollywood crap fest.
I am fine with adaptations.  Sometimes they can be better than the originals, but it seems the changes were made for the wrong reasons.  I didn't need the books dumbed down to the American public.  And I don't think they did either, well, I hope not.",1068681600,2,3271,4.43824027072758
1459969,5,B00005JKZU,"In reviewing anything, the benchmark is simply this: Did the creator accomplish what he set out to do? In this case, for less than $30 bucks, you get FOUR DVDs that were not packaged as an afterthought product to make a quick buck -- as is often the case -- but integrated as part of Peter Jackson's vision for his film trilogy. As he said, he has ""interpreted"" Tolkien's trilogy, which meant that, for a film trilogy that cost $300 million to make, he bears final responsibility for what appears on the screen. And for most fans -- especially movie-goers and Tolkien fans alike -- that interpretation satisfies more than it displeases; in fact, with this extended DVD set, in which you get the film version with added footage seamlessly integrated in the original footage AND a rescored soundtrack, you get a great buy for your buck. Peter Jackson, on the extended DVD of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, said that he's not a big fan of the term ""Director's Cut"" because if implies that what was on the screen wasn't what he had intended; in his case, what appeared on the screen WAS what he intended, so he's happy with that. That said, the extended DVD of FELLOWSHIP is an enhancement, adding footage that fleshes out the original footage. As for the bonus material: it's supplementary and there if you want to see it, but the main course is the extended DVD footage itself.

Regardless of whether or not Jackson is recognized with an Oscar for what is, in terms of films, a crowning achievement -- three films that will stand the test of time, and set a high watermark for film epics -- the fact remains that he'll be the king of the boxoffice this year.

As for the complaints heard from some Tolkien fans that Jackson has not slavishly followed the text: You can please some of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time. I recall that even when the initial casting was announced, some fans complained long and hard that THIS actor of THAT actor wasn't right for the part, without even giving the actor a chance to show his stuff on screen! In retrospect, the casting was inspired and it is indeed an ensemble cast -- a term used far too freely in the film community, which has cheapened its use.

Trust me on this one, folks: Jackson spent hundreds of millions to give you a visual translation of Tolkien's epic, and you get it for, essentially, pocket change. He could have simply released the theatrical version and left it at that, but he didn't: He gave us more, much more, with the extended DVD.

In the end, perhaps Tolkien himself, in a foreword to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, said it best: ""Some who have read the book, or at any rate reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible.... It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved.""

I recently had the pleasure of recently publishing a book about Tolkien and concluded that, after looking at thousands of items with a Tolkien tie-in, that the DVDs are great values for the money. As I wrote in my book, ""...Sit back and let the movie take you away to Tolkien's imaginative universe, as envisioned by Peter Jackson, who has carefully and lovingly brought the book to the screen--and, by doing so, has introduced millions of people to the wondrous world of Middle-earth.""

It's rather sad that Bakashi, with half the screen time to work with, was able to be more faithful in adapting JRRT's plot and dialogue for FotR.  Yet as horrific as Jackson's first movie was, his second was a crime against the soul of the book.

1459972,4,B00005JKZU,"I really enjoyed LOTR books, and so far, have enjoyed the movies. Some people don't like this movie because they haven't read the books and have the attention span of a gnat (not their fault, but still there). Some people didn't like it because it wasn't ""Tolkien enough"". A few things I have noticed about other reviews and what they meant to me....
""Faramir not being noble and wise"". Some people have stated that they thought that Faramir taking Frodo to Osgiliath(sp?) meant that his character was betrayed. No, it didn't happen in the book, but Yes, it's still Faramir. If Faramir was not wise and noble, he wouldn't have let Frodo leave at all. Love it or hate it, the only reason that Mr. Jackson did it this way was because it gives him a more human character. He thinks that taking the ring back is a good idea, has some time to think about it and realizes that it needs to be destroyed. If he were just to say ""I don't want it"" it would have reduced the impact that Boromir had when he succumbed to power of the Ring, just making Boromir weak and easily swooned. This way, it shows that Faramir was wise and noble by showing a conflict and him overcoming the temptation to take the ring.
Also, many people think it should have stayed true to the book more, but how Peter saw it (and Christopher Lee, who was said to read the books once a year, and is a MAJOR purist) and how I see it is that there are so many things in the books that either would detract from the story, or would just be plain stupid put on screen (I see Tom Bombadil being like this... I mean, it would be Barney-esk), so they didn't include them. Anything they added has been to add a little more intruque/conflict/interest for people that haven't read the book. 80% of the book is intact, 20% new stuff added. Actually, for the first time this has ever come to the screen, it has been done masterfully.
I will leave with this point:
If you don't like how it was done and want to bash it, where's your version of it? Take it for what it is, not what you want it to be. ""Those who expect everything will be sorely disappointed, those who expect nothing will be pleasantly surprised.""",1068595200,12,2162,4.340740740740741

As I read the text, I created a little movie in my head about what the characters looked like, how they acted, the scenery, the mannerisms, and everything about them.
Now, usually, when a book is turned into a movie, it's horrible. It crushes my ""mind movie"" and I have to make allowances for the director's ""Interpretation.""
The beauty and genius of this series, is, I have seen my mind unfold on screen. Peter Jackson et all has made my imagination become a reality. These movies are made SO CLOSE to what I imagined, frankly, it's a little scary! And, through the magic of DVD, we are able to see the Uncut versions of the movie. Directors always have to allow for ""economics"" and annoying people that don't want to sit through long movies. So, you end up with a chopped up piece of a movie. With these, you get to see it the way the DIRECTOR intended it. And in this case, the director is an absolute genius. I want this man to re-create ALL future movies for me.

1459974,5,B00005JKZU,"This certainly isn't the movie J.R.R. Tolkien would have made, had he the opportunity to do so.  It also isn't the movie his family would have made - indeed, they are reportedly unhappy with Peter Jackson's rendering of their patriarch's work.
But it is a DARN GOOD MOVIE.  As a dedicated Tolkien fan, I left the theater angry (just as I had The Fellowship of the Ring).  In this movie, two extremely important scenes were left out, and one scene was changed so much I found it perverted.
The two scenes left out were: the breaking of Saruman's staff by Gandalf; and Shelob.
Gandalf breaking Saruman's staff, and the dialogue that transpired between the two, is some of the best writing in the book.  It's also of tremendous significance.  Gandalf *should* have been Saruman - meaning that Galadriel had wanted Gandalf to be the leader of the Istari, but Gandalf declined, not wanting any allegiances, nor did he wish to be beholden to anyone.  Coming back from the dead, after his epic struggle with the Balrog of Moria (and Balrogs, for those unfamiliar with some of the intricacies of Tolkien lore, are of the same race as Gandalf, Saruman, and Sauron -- the Maiar), he returned as Gandalf the White.  The completion of his return was symbolically dependent upon breaking Saruman's staff, and that didn't make the cut.
Many people complained (that is, many people who never read the books) that at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring really wasn't much of an end at all.  There was no cliffhanger, no real reason to come back to see the second movie.  Well, the scene with Shelob would certainly have fixed that problem in this film.
My mention of ""perverted"" referred to the treatment of Faramir.  I was considerably outraged that the entire nature of his character had been changed.  Instead of treating Frodo and Sam as equals, the Faramir of the film treated them like prisoners.
However, when all is said and done, I'm not a film maker.  This book was not an easy one to bring to the screen.  You can't just implant the images and words from the book onto the screen without considerable refinement.  In the books those images and words are astonishing, but on the silver screen who knows?  They may not have worked well at all.
Seeing the extended version of The Two Towers made me feel much better about the movie as a piece of the Lord of the Rings than the version released to the theater (I felt the same for Fellowship).
I can't wait...quite literally...for the extended version of The Return of the King.  It's been suggested that Gandalf's dealings with Saruman occur in there.  I hope so.  If that was left out entirely, I will be gravely disappointed.",1068422400,,2671,4.658848614072495
1460113,4,B00005JKZU,"First things first: This extended version of The Two Towers is a superior stand-alone film and a superior adaptation of Tolkien than it's theatrical cousin.  Unfortunately, TTT SEE still does not reach the bar set by Fellowship of the Ring in either of these categories.  Fellowship of the Ring (both Theatrical and Extended) was a truly fantastic accomplishment because it worked brilliantly as a stand-alone film and it worked brilliantly as an adaptation of Tolkien's masterwork.  Peter Jackson did something amazing.  He met my huge expectations in both of these categories.  After FOTR, my expectations for The Two Towers were even loftier.  Sadly, even with the superior extended edition, TTT fails to meet my expectations.  In my opinion, the filmmakers got a little cocky, a little too creative and began to tinker with the story in places that did not need tinkering.  The end result:  Two Towers, even in this extended version, does not reflect the brilliance of the book in the way that FOTR did.
That being said, this new version of the film is still very good.  The added scenes do much to flesh out the newly introduced characters (Treebeard, Eowyn and Faramir especially).  The new scenes add Tolkien dialogue (always appreciated).  They make the story feel more epic, giving a greater sense of depth and history to Middle Earth (Numenor, entwives, Dunedein are all mentioned).  However, several of the new scenes contain (what I would consider to be) misplaced humor.  If you had significant problems with the theatrical cut (non-Tolkien characterization of Theoden, time wasted with Arwen/Aragorn, Merry/Pippin tricking the ents into launching their assault on Isengard, Elves at Helm's Deep, Frodo taken to Osgiliath, etc.) then the extended cut of the film will not do much to satisfy you.  However, there are several additions that should make purists markedly happier:  Here are a few:
-The Return of Gandalf is amped up with additional dialogue, including some classic, spine-tingling Tolkien prose: ""Something is about to happen that hasn't happened for an age.  The ents are going to wake up... and find that they are strong.""
-Treebeard is given more dignified lines and scenes.
-Faramir's motivations are at last understood.  He wants to please his demanding father (great performance here by John Noble as Denethor), but in the end understands that the Ring would enslave the Steward of Gondor.  Thus he releases Frodo to complete his errand.
-An explanation by Gandalf of the ""One Advantage"" of the West: that Sauron would never expect that the Ringbearer's quest will be to destroy the Ring.
There are several more great additions that I will leave a surprise.
In summation, for those that loved the book and loved the 1st film, but were disappointed with the Theatrical TTT, this new, LONG, version of TTT is richer and more enjoyable than the theatrical cut, but is not ""nearly perfect"" - as I thought the extended version of FOTR was.  I still give it 4 out of 5 stars, as it is a far better film than most of the junk that is being made these days (Fellowship would get 6 out of 5 stars, in my opinion).",1068422400,20,3136,4.937142857142857

  what i have to sat about the trilogy to date is that it one of the most visually stunning pieces of cinema in a long time. period. the producers of these movies must have read my mind, because they have been on the same track that my minds eye was when i first read the books. no matter what else is said about the series, i commend the producers on that momentous feat. congrats.
  now personally, i will be watching this very intensely, why? because if the directors and editors don't clean things up in the two towers like they did the fellowship of the ring, i am going to boycott the release of the 3rd installment, mabeye even protest it, see u on the news!! they have been stadily going downhill since the release of the first movie in regards to the accuracy to the books, and i do understand some, if not most of the changes made, but they have, with the release of this second film, actually made changes contrawise to what the brilliant mind tolkein put on paper over half a century ago. (...)
  now I can totally understand having to make changes to convert the book, with tolkeins gift for imagery and dialouge, to a visual format like a movie, i see where u can and need to make changes, but elrond even encouraged the union of aragorn and arwen, to paraphrase, 'just as long as you win!', no joke, JUST READ. but to make (...), er elrond, sorry, actually opposed to their union is just one of the many problems that i personally had with this movie, just one example of many, that has actually angered, mildly, this fan of tolkein.
  bottom line, if you like good movies with cool effects, go for it, enjoy the cg animation, and don't forget the popcorn because they ARE good movies that are well done for the most part. And besides, it may just spark your interest enough to go read these wonderful books, which is never bad. IF you like the books for what they are, and for story, unless they get their act together on this one, i will have totally lost interest in the series, and will refuse to back this effort to commercialize somthing that should be shared with everyone, but never stepped on.

1460116,4,B00005JKZU,"There is the rare occasion when a sequel is as good as its predecessor. ""The Godfather Part II,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" I tried to put different genres into that, and if I can squeeze in fantasy, it would be ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.""
Based on the famous/classic work by J.R.R. Tolkien, this is the second ""Lord of the Rings"" film to grace the screen, or, as its fans refer to it, ""LotR."" In the previous film we saw Middlearth (one word?), home of the human-like species of Hobbits, brought to life by director Peter Jackson. It was bright, cheery, happy...but ""LotR: TTT"" is much darker than its predecessor. No cheery shots of grassy plains here; it's dark, broody, and evil.
In the first film, we found out that long ago a creature/figure known as Sauron created a mystical ring deep in the craters of Mount Doom, located conveniently in the evilest place in the whole wide world, Mordor. (Just listen to Hugo Weaving say ""Mordor""--it sounds creepy.)
To get to the chase, Sauron was temporarily destroyed, and the ring, through one way or another, came to the creature Gollum, who then lost it to a Hobbit named Bilbo (who, in Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit,"" found it on a quest with Gandalf--a story not ventured into much in ""The Lord of the Rings"").
Years passed, and Sauron grew stronger (even though he's sorta dead), and he sent out baddies to try and hunt down the Ring, so that he may use its power (only he can wield the ring) for evil. Bilbo had since left the ring to Frodo, his kin, who then fled Middlearth with three others (four if you count Gandalf). Soon a few more joined their quest, and these men, Hobbits, and what not, formed a Fellowship. Their quest is to venture into Mordor and destroy the ring where it was created.
At the end of the first film the Fellowship of the Ring had been seperated. Here's what has happened so far in the second film: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) found Gollum, who becomes their tour guide to Mordor.
Aragorn, Legolas and co. made their way to a castle somewhere, that is about to be attacked by a band of Orcs led by Saruman (Christopher Lee). They prepare for the battle by readying troops.
Pippin and Merry escaped from the band of Orcs that kidnapped them at the end of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" where they came upon talking, walking trees, one of which took them to the much-alive Gandalf, who says that he died and returned to earth as ""Gandalf the White"" (versus Gandalf the Grey) to help out the Fellowship.
That's the main plot, but the film (ranking it at just about three hours) has so many characters that is constantly either a) forgets about some (not much of Frodo and Sam in this film), or b) tries to remember them by abruptly cutting to them. One of the film's only flaws is its inability to focus on all the characters equally; a feat ""X-Men 2"" accomplished quite nicely.
The new character Gollum is a scene-stealer. Easily the best character in the film. One of the most impressive visual effects I have ever seen, which I suppose is because he was formed from images of a real man running around, and then was just overlapped with graphics and such.
""The Two Towers"" is fun to watch, and though some scenes could definitely have been dropped on the cutting room floor, the film more than makes up for the overlong scenes. I especially liked a battle between Aragorn and his troops, and Orcs on top of creatures that look like a mix between hyenas, dogs, and pigs. The dog-creatures move extremely fast and viciously (but of course the good guys still win ;). And the last half hour or so is one gigantic battle against Orcs, and the special effects are truly enthralling.
You liked the first film? You're going to really enjoy this one. You didn't like the first film? You're still going to enjoy this one. I thought the original film was a tad overrated. Okay, a lot overrated. Seeing that on IMDb it suddenly beat out every single movie ever made and ranked in at the no. 1 film of all time, you can say I was fumin' a bit. It was good, and I especially liked the shooting locations in New Zealand, but you can say I wasn't exactly a huge fan.
If I had to choose a favorite so far, I may very well say ""The Two Towers."" It's hard, because the first had some great scenery. This one loses the brightness of the first film, and I must say I liked the cheeriness of the original. (Of course, it is supposed to lost the brightness, just like the book did, because they are venturing closer to Mordor.)
I expect ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" to excite all the ""LotR"" geeks out there, and thrill the regular audiences. I just wish the fans would stop getting thirty usernames on IMDb and voting ""10"" millions of times.",1068422400,3,4748,4.464902186421174

Me being the person who watched LOTR movies without thinking about the details, found the movies to be extremely good. Although I did read the books before the idea came of making these movies, I was just a child so can't remember the details but I remember the basic story and how much I enjoyed it. I think you will enjoy this movie if you have or haven't read Tolkien's books. I personally enjoyed every minute of the movie, and so I enjoy the special extended edition even more. There is not a scene i would take out nor things I would add (except make the prequel). If you don't enjoy the LOTR movies then I don't know of any recent movies that you could enjoy. If you like battle sequences look no farther, these movies have it all. If you want a love story these movies are full of love. These movies invented the word adventure...",1068422400,8,991,4.450549450549451
1460118,5,B00005JKZU,"I give LOTR The Two Towers five stars. It is among the best movies ever made. And those Tolkien purists who complain about the differences between the books and the movies don't understand that the love story of Arwen and Aragorn was really close to Tolkien's heart.
The love story of Arwen and Aragorn is not found in the LOTR story itself, although it is found in an Appendix in Vol 3 ROTK, and is also found in Tolkien's Silmarillion. And so we know that the story is based on the love story of Beren (mortal man) and Luthien (immortal elf-maiden). In the movie FOTR (extended version), Aragorn as much as tells us this himself, when he sings the song about Beren and Luthien while he leads the hobbits in the wilderness on their way to Weathertop.
The love story of Beren and Luthien was important to Tolkien. After the Hobbit was a smashing success in 1937, the publisher asked Tolkien if he had any more material to be published. Tolkien gave him the story of Beren and Luthien, as part of the Silmarillion. The publisher declined to publish this story, preferring instead to print a sequel to the Hobbit. As we all know, this sequel is LOTR...
And here's the reason why the story of Beren and Luthien was so important to Tolkien. Beren is Tolkien himself, and Luthien is Edith Mary, the sweetheart of Tolkien's youth, whom he married in 1916, and faithfully adored until her death in 1971, two years before Tolkien himself died. You can see the inscription on their tombstone in the Wolvercote Cemetery in the northern suburbs of Oxford, UK ([...]
When Tolkien wrote that Luthien was the fairest elf that ever lived, he was writing about his wife. And when Peter Jackson decided that his movies should showcase the themes that Tolkien really cared about, he knew what he was doing when he included the love story of Arwen and Aragorn.",1068336000,107,1841,4.615853658536586
1460259,4,B00005JKZU,"I'll be honest here, if I had seen this film as an independent story from new material, I'd have given it five stars.  In essence I'm rating it here against the first film in the series.  The first film was nothing short of amazing, incredible visuals, standout characters, and truly ""boffo"" action sequences.  The reason for a letdown here is the characters were a bit forgotten. The majority of people I asked, and including myself came out of this film with the idea that the biggest standout character was Gollum.  ""Strange it is my precious"", when the most notable character in an epic movie is an animated one!
I have to blame this on the direction.  While a difficult thing to do, a director must give the movie some focus, and enough intimate scenes with the characters. This is to keep from being over shadowed by the special effects, and epic battles. Perhaps it was bit too easy in the first movie having the interaction of Tolkiens ""Fellowship"", to give the characters focus.  I'll admit that since you have groups of characters spread in many different locations, it is nearly impossible to accomplish a good focus on each group. Yet, the Gollum character seemed to accomplish it.  Perhaps by asking for a bit more ""over the top"" performances we have been able to see the characters, over the roar of the epic battle scenes.
Along with Gollum, the battle sequences just made the movie.  Recent movies with big battle scenes such as the Aussie opuses, Braveheart, and The Gladiator, were actually dwarfed by the size, and scope of the battles seen here.  I didn't think film could ever contain the huge scope, and flow of the battles Tolkien described in his ""Rings"" novels, but movie proved me wrong!  The struggle depicted really made you think that the forces of evil, could indeed overrun, and control all of middle earth. It gave even more credence, to the mission of the ring bearer.  This was a great movie, I just couldn't rate it ""quite"" as good as the first.
Some notes on the DVD, I like the wide screen version because I don't like my epics to be cut.  I know some folk out there that complain they are missing content when it is wide screen, because of the bars on the top and bottom. It becomes hard to explain, that they are not really taking away any picture, they are just using less of your TV screen.  My response (usually takes people by surprise) is that TVs near future is watching it on HDTV and plasma screens. These sets have a wider aspect ratio than our current TVs. Would you want your future dvd showings to have the bars on the sides where you, ""really are"" missing content?
One final note, I am prepared to hate the final movie in this trilogy.  The reason is: like in the books, Tolkien understood that we the reader would know that the ring bearer would succeed somehow.  Which is probably why the ring is destroyed midway though the last book of the trilogy. Its rare when a book plays out it's ending into the life after the big climatic sequence.  Even though us as the reader usually wants to hear more of the story.  Tolkien did that, and did it successfully, by returning the Hobbits to the Shire, and having them use their ""battle tested strength"", and ""bred from experience"" guile, to defeat yet another great evil.  I hope this will be included in the final film, but because of time constraints I have my doubts.",1068249600,4,3367,4.5647840531561465

This is what they always do for these masterpiece movies; they make a real special DVD package with all these documentaries and stuff just...booooring.

1460261,5,B00005JKZU,"I recently read, once again, the original J.R.R. Tolkien triology of Lord of the Rings and was reminded of the ""creative"" ways in which the director, Peter Jackson, made a few changes such as having a character say something or do something that someone else had said or done in the books, dropped scenes, and added scenes that never even existed in the books. There is a rumor going around that some day he will explain these changes to angry fans of the original books.  If this is true it will be interesting to hear what he has to say.
In the meantime...
I said all the above first to get it out of the way.  When I went to see the first movie I was aware of the differences between the movie and original story but I didn't care...this movie was great!  Everything good and beautiful were in place: great locations, top-notch acting, set designs and costumes,it was beautifully filmed, CGI done exceptionally well, beautifully written and directed...this film just rocked!  I was carried along with a story of such breadth and height by all these things and couldn't wait to see the next installment.  It did not disappoint me!
LOR: TTT has once again captured me up in the fine art of story-telling and the best of the best in making a film right.  At my first full look at Gollum I sat there with my mouth open, amazed they were able to capture the essence of the creature so well.  (I read the books in my early teens and I remember imagining Gollum just this way!)  Once again, I cared deeply for the characters.  Once again I could not find fault with any one actor's portrayal, even the bit parts were made interesting by the superb acting.  In this film, as in the first, obviously everyone involved was on top of their game. Applause.
Now to the DVD.  I was very disappointed that there were some elements on the DVD I could not access unless I got online and registered.  There was no mention of this anywhere on the DVD itself, that I would need to register and give away, yet AGAIN, my personal information to a company whose only interest is selling me more of their products and selling my e-mail/snail mail addresses to others...GEESH!  So, because I have not registered the product online, (with my very own personal registration code that came with the DVD), I cannot access some of the features on the DVD that I PAID FOR!!!  Bah!!!
The other features included on the DVD consist mostly of ""The Making Of..."" type shorts which are a mix of interesting tidbits for the LORphiles and boring talk about how cleverly they went about all things LOR:TTT.

1460262,5,B00005JKZU,"Director Peter Jackson must have some kind of PhD in moviemaking that few folks are even close to.  The way he is able to put this whole project (look at the bonus material on the DVD and you'll see what I mean) together into an incredible work of art is just beyond words.  The performances are out of this world, and as far as the ladies are concerned: some might say that the actor who plays Aragorn gives Brad Pitt a serious run for his money.  Then again, maybe not. Let's face it.... it's Brad we're talking about all of a sudden, not chopped liver.
I  do have some peeves that came out; maybe others of you have the same feeling:
1) Elija Wood as Frodo ""The Dazed and Confused "" during most of the film does get a bit tired.  I realize the significance of hobbits in general (in Tolkien's world), but in this film he seems to detract from the story, not enhance it.
2) How did Liv Tyler get third billing on the credits when she had maybe two and a half minutes of screen time?

1460264,5,B00005JKZU,"Presiding over a scene resembling a Bosch-like hell, renegade Wizard Saruman, (Christopher Lee), intones menacingly, ""The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new world order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear."" Saruman, in league with the evil, dark Lord Sauron, is bent on the destruction of mankind, beginning with the people of Rohan and leading to eventual control of the entire world. They want the One Ring of Power in order to succeed with their plans.
""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes over exactly where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off. The transition from the first film to the second is so seamless that the idea to make all three films, parts one, two and three, at the same time with different release dates seems to have been an excellent one. The members of the Fellowship parted at the conclusion of the last movie. This film opens with Frodo Baggins (brilliantly played by Elijah Wood), the Ringbearing Hobbit, and his loyal companion Samwise Gangee, (Sean Astin), making their way through the grim landscape, over cold, misty mountains and through the Dead Marshes toward their goal to destroy the Ring. Demented, obsessed Smeagle, the Gollum, trails them and then, discovered, leads them toward their fate. Gandalf the Gray is left spiraling down a seemingly infinite abyss, fighting the terrible fire monster, Balrog. The man Aragon, (Viggo Mortensen), the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) after meeting up with the resurrected Gandalf, now called The White, go to the aid of the besieged Rohan people. Saruman waits for word of victory at Orthanc Tower in Isengard, while Sauron's fiery eye searches for the Ring and its bearer from his tower and fortress at Baraddur, in the terrible land of Mordor. The climatic battle at Helm's Gate is probably one of the most stunningly impressive battle scenes I have ever watched.
The special effects used in ""The Two Towers"" are absolutely amazing. I have never seen fantasy characters brought to life more brilliantly than in this film. Smeagle, the schizophrenic Gollum, is just as nasty, pathetic and sad as I imagined him from Tolkien's wonderful description. The orcs, the Balrog, the Ents, all come alive on the screen, wonderfully imaged and as good as one's own inner eye could imagine them. There were stupendous creative forces at work on this production. And the photography and scenery are breathtaking - absolutely spectacular! What a visual treat.
There is some departure from Tolkien's original text, but, for me, the film kept true to the spirit of ""The Two Towers."" It is almost impossible to make an effective motion picture from a long and complex book, where all the details remain the same. A particularly poignant scene, worth noting, is the passing of the magical elves from this world. All in all, I really enjoyed every minute of this 5 star film. I have read Tolkien's Triogy at least three times, and never thought it would be possible to do such a wonderful film rendition.

But back to my original point.  I am a devoted reader of fantasy books, and have long loved Tolkiens trilogy.  Personally, I'm amazed at how closely these guys followed the books.  Oh no, you mean Aragorn didn't really jump off the wall!?!?  BIG STINKIN' deal.  That doesn't really impact the plot lines at all.  The reason they took Frodo to Gondor was probably to help the viewer get a sense of the desperate situation there without wasting time throwing in side stories.  You have to hand it to these men.  They have followed the plots and made better movies than I would have ever expected in a thousand life times.  Just look at Jurassic Park, or any movie based on a book.  In the Book ""Jurassic Park"" the Grandpa was greedy and even died (among tens of other plot changes).  These movies have helped the world visualize and appreciate Tolkiens world.

1460423,1,B00005JKZU,"Meaning well, a being of some power is seduced by the Ring.  This being obtains their objective, becoming very powerful, and overthrowing Sauron as the new Dark Lord, controlling Middle-Earth!  Who is this being?  It's Peter Jackson!  Meaning to create a trilogy of movies of a great, classic fantasy, the temptation of Jackson's ego becomes too great, and he creates his OWN Lord of the Rings...bringing to the screen something that only partially resembles the classic book.
But my main objective of this review is to point out that there are significant differences between this movie and the book it's based on, and to those people that have not read ""The Lord of the Rings"" book(s), to please read the book.  There are those that have read the book and seen the movie - some may like both or like the movie better...that is their rightful opinion.  I now consider myself a ""Tolkien purist""...I didn't know I was one before Jackson's movies came out, but, being that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is my favorite book, I was expecting spectacular movies in all aspects.  I was disappointed with the first movie, but I am infuriated with this second movie.  First let me state, that by definition, a real Tolkien purist cannot like this ""The Two Towers"" movie.  A purist cannot tolerate any deviations, except, maybe, for the understandable & necessary condensing/consolidating needed to bring a book to the screen.  After reading his biography, JRR Tolkien was the first & foremost Tolkien purist!  He sold the movie rights 30+ years ago...never imagining a film or films could really be done. He would never have even bothered to see any movies...unless, I think, they got rave reviews and included every bit of dialogue, story, and descriptions in his book...a series of movies that probably would've totaled over 50 hours!  He would not have been sympathetic to any changes needing to be done to bring his book to the screen.
The positives of this movie:
Gollum; especially when his good side argues with his bad side.  When his good side wins out temporarily until he feels betrayed by Frodo and then his bad side wins out, this the best example of positive artistic license!  Book to movie comment: takes a few seconds to bring this out more than the book.  (A personal rating: I give Gollum +5 points)
Arwen sees in her mind's eye what the future will be like after Aragorn dies when her father Elrond tells her she'll regret her choice for Aragorn/mortality.  Book to movie comment: this is described in the Appendix, adding time, but I thought it was perfectly done! (+1)
Acting, with the exception of Faramir, is great! (+1)
Visuals (costumes, special effects, settings, cinematography). Book to movie comment: these are exceptional! (+3)
The neutrals in this movie:
King Theoden being possessed by Saruman.  An example of acceptable artistic license...some may find it great.  Book to movie comment: may add a few seconds to Theoden's transformation back to being the real King of Rohan. (0)
The negatives in this movie:
Saruman being a complete lackey of Saruon's, thus leading to Merry & Pippin's escape because of the orc fight because Grishnakh wants to eat them?!  Book to movie comment: Grishnakh is a Mordor orc, Ugluk is an Isengard orc - the orc fight occurs when more Mordor orcs arrive and Grishnakh is under orders to bring the hobbits to Sauron, while Ugluk is under orders to bring them to Saruman.  That's because Saruman covets the ring for himself and, once he's got it, would've challenged Sauron.  I don't see why there's this difference because it wouldn't have added time to the movie and unnecessarily takes away complexity that's in the book.  (-4)
Wargs attack Aragorn & Riders on way to Helm's Deep, and Aragorn falls over a height into a river.  Book to movie comment: not in the book & takes a few minutes that could've been spent bringing out more of the book. (-1)
Elves at Helm's Deep and death of Haldir.  Book to movie comment: not in the book and takes up more time, plus Haldir doesn't die at all! (-2)
Merry & Pippin make Treebeard take them past Isengard resulting in the Ents attack.  Book to movie comment: the Ents make the decision to attack Saruman on their own in their Entmoot.  I can't understand at all why this was done, and it changes the character of the Ents.  They are tree-herders, and are sensitive enough to know when Saruman's orcs are killing trees.  And the trees/Ents were very significant to Tolkien himself! (-5)
Eomer leads the Riders that help turn the tide at Helm's Deep.  Book to movie comment: Erkenbrand leads the Riders while Eomer fights in Helm's Deep.  Women have few significant roles in the book.  I think it would've been great to have Dernhelm lead the Riders! (-1 for the lost opportunity)
Faramir decides to take Frodo, Sam, & Gollum to his father in Gondor, and the subsequent confrontation with a Nazgul.  Book to movie comment: this was the most infuriating difference...it takes several minutes, too!  Faramir is almost the exact opposite of his brother, Boromir.  He shows significant wisdom by avoiding the Ring and letting the hobbits go.  The encounter with the Nazgul is absurd!  While this MAY set up scenes in the next movie (why Mordor's first attack is at Faramir in Osgiliath), it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense that after one Nazgul was thwarted why the rest wouldn't immediately be upon the Ring-bearer...not to mention the Eye of Sauron! (-7)
All other little differences between the book & movie in the story line or dialogue, including Arwen leaving Rivendell to sail West. (-3)
When added up, my personal ratings total (-13), and that's the reason why I don't like this movie.  I will not contribute any more money directly to Jackson & his cronies via theatre or video, because money is what they understand most.  The movies have gotten a lot more people to read the book...that's great!  I hope I can also get more people to read the book by pointing out how different this movie is.",1067904000,25,5998,4.780795344325897

The continuation of the Fellowship begins within a day of the first film, the catapults into near hysterical abandonment. The film explodes so fast that's it's nearly dizzying. At the same time, when it stops, it feels stopped. When the endless shots of Merry & Pippin bouncing up and down on the Ent are finally over we have, well the movie pretty much ends 20 minutes later.

The extended version seeks more balance of action and story. The most unfortunate parts of the film are three voice over montages with Elrod, Galadriel and Saruman telling us the story we are seeing. I hated the damn voice-overs, they where obviously just there explain to those who did not read the book what is going on. They are distracting and annoying and the hurt the film and insult the viewer. The entire sub-plot of Arwen facing life alone when Aragorn dies makes no sense. She gives up Immortality to marry him, she won't live forever when he dies -- Didn't Jackson read ALL the book? This wasn't just a change, I can accept change, I don't mind the Elves at Helms Deep or Farimer not being so wonderful as in the book, I don't care about that.

He has tweaked the story, but has totally kept the essence of it alive. I was in awe of both films as every view described by Tolkien unfolded on the screen exactly as I had always imagined it, Helms Deep, the Golden Hall,and Fangorn Forest for example.
The film leads exactly from the ending of the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and begins to greatly enhance the characters as they head to the inevitable finale.  The Wargs, which really belong in the first film, are stunningly realistic, and the Ents are also totally convincing, although not used exactly as Tolkien described, their portrail on film is perfect.
In Criticising Frodo and Samwise's relationship, Samwise is actually the stronger of the characters in the book and the film reflects that, and Frodo's increasing weakness also follows Tolkien's story. Gollum, quite simply, DOES have a personality disorder, he loves the ring, and yet desparately wants to care for both himself and Frodo.
The Two Towers delivers on every level, effects are, of course superb, and characterisation is perfect.  The climax leaves the viewer desperate for the final installment, Helms Deep's battle is unsurpassed in movie history (until the next film!) and I truly believe J R R Tolkien would have happily shook Peter Jackson's hand had he had the chance to watch Jacksons version of his tale unfold.

1460636,5,B00005JKZU,"O.K., I've read the books.  I know that J.R.R. Tolkien is in a class by himself as a writer of The Lord of The Rings trilogy.  No movie, could ever replicate the intricacies of that epic work.  Tolkien spent his entire life writing LOTR and the Simarillion.
Peter Jackson has attempted to translate Tolien's literary fantasy to the screen.  The first attempt, The Fellowship of the Ring, was good, entertaining and pleasant.  The second, the subject of this review, The Two Towers, is a masterpiece. Jackson, did not attempt to translate every detail of the book onto the screen.  that would have been artistic suicide.  The LOTR was originally meant to be one book.  Tolkien's publisher divided into three  because it was so long.  Jackson took The Two Towers  and made it exciting and suspenseful without sacrificing the essence of Tolkien's writing.
The characters are exactly as I envisioned them.  Aragorn is a bit more fleshed out than in the books, but it works.
This movie is beyond enjoyable.

They had like 3 tv show documentaries, and thats about it, photo galleries.
I bought my family the extended version last year, and they loved it, i'm going to buy this extended version when it comes out for myself since my parents got the lowdown one.

Certainly, as Sam Cable points out below, there are egregious errors in this production. Most disappointing was the artificial excorcism of Saruman from Theoden.
Still, this film was adapted from a great story and that story wasn't entirely lost in the facile theatrics introduced in number two. I hope to see a more faithful reproduction of Tolkein's work in the upcoming Return of the King",1067644800,2,564,4.947368421052632
1460639,5,B00005JKZU,"By this point, people interested in this movie are probably already in one of two camps: A) Loved it; B) Hated it. The storyline does not always adhere religiously to that laid down by the Professor all those years ago when he wrote the Lord of the Rings, but Pete Jackson does a FREAKING GREAT job of carrying on the story HE established in the first movie. The character moments are wonderful, the set pieces spectacular, the effects mind-blowing. It is... difficult... at times to do so, but the people that have problems with the screen versions of the LORD OF THE RINGS generally cannot accept that modifications are necessary in order to see this story on screen at all. And this is a great presentation. Fellowship of the Ring was fantastic, and The Two Towers equally so. I expect The Return of the King to be mind-blowing as well.

The scenery was yet again spectacular and the actors took their roles to heart and played each with intensity.

Thank you Peter Jackson for providing us with a true jewel in film history.",1067472000,6,635,4.435897435897436
1460642,3,B00005JKZU,"Much more so than ""Fellowship of the Ring"", this chapter focuses too much on overrated special effects. Like Lucas, Peter Jackson seems to believe that these CGI effects are better than they are and that they can carry a movie.  I felt this way when I saw the movie at the theater and feel even more so having seen it on TV- the battle scenes have little substance and attempt to (ineffectively) fool you into believing that there is actually a detailed scene occurring on the screen.  In reality, I find them blurry, dark and confusing.  Battle was certainly a key part of Tolkien's work, but was really only peripheral to a much larger whole.  I don't want to see a fantasy version of ""Braveheart"" when watching LOTR (at least ""Braveheart"" used real people to recreat its battle scenes).
Gollum, on the other hand, was wonderful and his scenes are the redeeming feature of this chapter.  He's no Jar Jar Binks, that's for sure.  I had always imagined Gollum to be a black, froglike creature (no doubt this was formed by watching the cartoon version of ""The Hobbit"").  However, this pale, more human version seems much more accurate to Tolkien's vision and I can easily adapt my imagination to accept this thing as how Gollum should truly look.
I'm not one to insist that a movie be a literal adaptation of a book- it should be an interpretation but not a scene by scene reenactment of the author's every word.  I think the Harry Potter movies, as good as they are, are a bit too sterile and took the safe path when adapting those books.  However, some of the added and changed scenes really detract from Tolkien's works- I won't give away spoilers, but this veered much further away from the book than did the first movie.  Again, I think a lot of that was done in order to emphasize the battle scenes.  But there are some major changes to some important characters (Faramir, the Ents, Saruman) that really detract from my enjoyment.  And the added scene with Aragorn and the worg and the cliff is almost comical.
This movie is still essential viewing, especially if you invested time in watching the first one.  I suspect that when these films are finished, it will be best viewed as one long movie rather than three individual parts.  Worthy adaptations of Tolkien, but too much emphasis on superficial qualities and overuse of overrated and unproven technology.  They LOOK good and are technically proficient, but somehow don't quite capture the spirit of what I took away from the books.",1067472000,10,2493,4.685779816513762

I think that those who are unable to see past the books to enjoy the movie-version, really are missing out. There is no movie in existence that has ever fully followed a book in it's entirely - yet these movies have done a good job of bringing Middle Earth alive.

1460644,5,B00005JKZU,"Overall Viewpoint:
Well worth watching, for people who have AND haven't read the book. Can't wait for the extra footage.
Note to Whiners:
What did you expect? Tolkien's work could never be turned into another format. I've read the books six or seven times, and I'm quite aware of the atmosphere of otherworldliness that he creates. The movies are much closer to the books than most book-to-movie massacres, and Jackson DID manage to bring some of the feeling of the books to the big screen. Props to him. I don't like the changes to the plotline, but this is still a masterpiece. Not a masterpiece on par with the books, but still a true work of art.
Note to Prosaic People:
If you don't have a philosophic bent, don't waste your time on this movie. You have to be at least somewhat idealistic and interested in the purpose of humanity, or this movie will just seem way too long and overly dramatic. Put another way, you'll either ""get it"" and love it, or miss what it's all about and hate it. Don't worry, you'll know in the first 10 minutes or so.
Note to Old-School Readers:
There are now two kinds of people in the world---those who read the books first, and those who watched the movie first. If I ever have kids, they're reading the books first, that's for darn sure.",1067385600,18,1273,4.491379310344827

1460792,5,B00005JKZU,"By the way, other reviewers, the Two Towers refers to Saruman's Tower and Sauron's Tower, not Gondor's towers. Saw that in another review.
It is nearly impossible to capture everything a book is to the readers for two reasons: poetic license and differing memories.  It's important to watch this movie as an incredible, epic attempt to recreate the book, and enjoy it.  No, it doesn't always follow the book that close and takes some liberties, but it does expose many more people to the genre, which is great!
The world is very well done, the acting is great. For a three hour movie about a twelve hour book, I loved it.  The main elements of the story are kept intact and the movie keeps a pace and doesn't drag us down in any long, slow distractions.
I highly recommend this movie.  Please also check out Fate Rides Wicked in the book section!",1067385600,,846,4.546052631578948
1460793,3,B00005JKZU,"I read some of the great reviews here and was tempted to give my own $0.02 on this movie.  To those who have not read the book, this is a great movie.  But to those of us who have experienced the Lord of the Rings at its best... the written words of Tolkien, this movies fars short.
I'm still waiting on the extended version in hopes that somehow, someway, it will be better.  I don't think I have very high expectations though, after seeing the theatrical version.
I know what people say about the second part of any trilogy... I disagree when it comes to the Two Towers.  It is by far my favorite book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  There was so much more left out of the movie and so many unnecessary scenes and events that were added.  Throughout the entire time I was watching, I kept saying to myself, ""this isn't how it happened..."" ""what happened to the part where..."" and ""now I KNOW that was not in the book""
Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the treatment of some of the events and characters.  Faramir, like Kelly Moore had mentioned, really got screwed.  (He's my favorite male character in the books, strange as it may be.)  Kelly said it already so I'll refer you to her review.
Eomer also got a completely different treatment in the movie.  Whatever happened to his loyalty and standing by his King, no matter the consequences?  He got banished?  Just so he can come riding down the hill with his small band of warriers behind Gandolf?  And the whole part with the Ents and Merry and Pippin was REALLY downplayed.  Those were also some of the best parts in the book.  I'm still hoping that some of those things will eventually get picked up in the third movie.  (Pippin's huge mistake that leads to the separation of Pippin and Merry.)  Both Merry and Pippin are so much more than the silly hobbits for comic relief they are portrayed in the movies.  They have vital roles in all of it.  Yet we don't really see that.  Those parts are replaced with Arwen and Aragorn contemplating whether they should be together or not (which, incidentally, was not that big a part in the actual story of the Ring, more in the appendix.)
The reason the book was called the Two Towers was because there were two battle fronts.  We really only got one.  I suppose we see a little bit of Gondor when Faramir kidnaps Frodo and Sam (that's one of the ""now I KNOW that was not in the book"" scenes), but it's just not in keeping with the spirit of the book.  And I still don't understand why Shelob had to be in the third movie instead of the second one like Tolkien had intended.  It seems lots of good things were cut from the second movie to make room for the unnecessary scenes (such as more relationship time for Aragorn and Arwen... [did they think the movie won't sell if there was no overt love story in it?])
I have to say, the Fellowship was a better movie when it came to staying true to the books.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let the Return of the King be true to what Tolkien had so perfectly envisioned all those years ago.
Now I have to go read the Two Towers a million times to try and recapture the magic.",1067299200,11,3123,4.333907056798623
1460794,5,B00005JKZU,"The release of The Two Towers followed the Fellowship in about a yeat later.  The cast for the most part is the same with Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Liv Tyler as Arwen and etc.  In the first movie, Frodo Baggins a Hobbit is met by Gandalf who urges Frodo on the quest to destroy the one Ring that has fallen in his possesion.  His quest is aided by a Fellowship with his gardener Sam, other fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom who seems popular among the ladies), and Glimli the dwarf.  Towards the end of their quest Saruman's troops of Urak-Hai warriors kidnap Merry and Pippin.  The fellowship splits as Sam and Frodo continue the quest to Mount Doom as Aragorn, Legolas, and Glimli continue to rescue Merry and Pippin.
The movie is pretty much split in two parts: one on the quest of Frodo, and one about Glimli, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gandalf.  The second quest begins with Aragorn, Legolas, and Glimli following the Urak-Hai to rescue Merry and Pippin.  They find the Urak-Hai killed by humans and Merry and Pippin escape into forbidden woods.  The three follow inside, and the trees promise to take care of the two hobbits.  Meanwhile  Aragorn, Glimli, and Legolas find Gandalf alive and well (now called Gandalf the White) as he supposedly died in the first movie.  The four evacuate the town of Rohan and move to the refuge in Helm's Deep where they must defend from the huge army of 10,000 Urak Hai, Saruman's troops, which seem impossible.
Meanwhile Frodo's quest is going astray as they utilize the help of Gollumn, a strange being, who is very mysterious.  They are captured by an army of humans and only after Boromir's brother sees what a burden the ring is, does he release Frodo, Sam, and Gollumn.  The ring seems to be slowly controlling Frodo, and his will is slowly slipping away.  These troubles begin to mount as the fate of Middle Earth is truly shaky.
The movie is long, but has exciting action sequences especially the climax, the Battle Of Helm's Deep.  The acting is decent, though the battles take a long chunk of the movie.  Watching it is fun, as you get sucked into the world of Middle Earth and the quests of the heroes.  Peter Jackson is a supberb director and The Two Towers is an awesome movie.  The effects and sounds are amazing, and the detail is meticulous.  A great movie altogether and a fitting sequal.",1067299200,,2424,4.621495327102804

A lot of [people complain that there is too much fighting in this movie.  But the war is the main focus on this part of the Lord of the Rings.  Plus some people complain that they left things out that were in the book.  Well, we should all know by now that movies are more often than not, different from the book.  The movie was already 3 and a half hours (minus the extra long version on DVD), they could probably have made each part 5 hours if they wanted to.  Plus i heard some of the stuff not in it would appear in Return of the King.  That's fine.  It's all about what is going on.  It makes more sense to me to do it that way.  Anyways...The Lord of the Rings was written as one book, not three.  And since this is just one movie serialized into three parts (cant have people in the theatre for 10 hours!) it doesn't matter.

I give Peter Jackson five stars for successfully capturing the look of Middle Earth.  The scenery, the epic battle scenes, the special effects are all first-rate.  For the most part, I like the cast also (I'm sorry, but Liv Tyler, although beautiful, simply hasn't the depth to play Arwen).  The reason I give the overall movie only three stars is because of the blatant disregard Jackson has for the character of Faramir, the brother of Boromir.  As anyone who has read the book knows, Faramir had wisdom and a sense of honor second only to Aragorn.  In the book, once Faramir became aware of Frodo's plight, he did everything he could to aid Frodo in his quest--he would never have forcibly taken Frodo and Sam to Gondor.  I have to agree with Sam Cable and some of the others who were disappointed in this movie:  There is no need to ""improve"" on Tolkien; and while I understand that some things have to be condensed or even cut to fit the story into three hours, I see little point in leaving out scenes that did occur in the book to make room for scenes that never happened in the book.

If you have the non-extended version DvD, make sure to check out the preview for the extended version, it will show you some nice scenes. On the other hand though, there is little excuse for the stuff which was added to the film (Arwen Saga, wargs, Helms deep accounting for a third of the movie). But then again, you want to keep the movie somewhat exciting, and Tolkein can lecture on in some parts.

1460900,5,B00005JKZU,"Few movies are able to overcome the middle-movie syndrome, i.e., the second installment in a three part movie.  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back comes to mind as the few movies that succeeded.  The Godfather Part 2 gave us insights into the origins of Vito Corleone and was an excellent 2nd movie.
The trick really is to tell a story in the middle movie without it seeming as an excuse to get to the third movie.  Really the Matrix Reloaded was a prime example of a movie that was just an excuse to get to the third movie.
The Two Towers (TTT) does admirably here in continuing the story setup in the first film which was about a little hobbit's quest to destroy the one ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  But more importantly, The Two Towers introduces the viewers to the real story of the LOTR and that is the slow but sure rise of Aragon to his rightful place as heir to the throne of Gondor and the redemption of men.  This aspect is really important and therefore it deserved a movie to weed it out and sets the tone nicely for the Return of The King.
More action than the first film, and with much less fantasy elements and Gimli the dwarf providing comic relief, TTT succeeds on all counts what it started out to do and tries also to bring some sort of continuation to the Arwen and Aragon love story and throwing a triangle in the mix with Eowyn who will play more important parts in the third part.  The film seemed slightly rushed with certain parts of the story not fleshed out properly. (Faramir's behaviour and background) The extended edition should fill in the gaps properly as long as you are willing to sit through 3 hours 42 minutes of it.  The film ends with the grand battle at Helm's Deep between Saruman's forces and the human forces with a surprise ally that really serves to tug the heart-strings a bit.  But I guess the biggest bone of contention was that my heart-strings were not tugged as much as when I saw the first movie, where there were moments of encouragement, inspiration and life lessons to be learnt along the way.

1460901,3,B00005JKZU,"After thoroughly enjoying Fellowship, I was excited to read the rave reviews here that suggested this installment to be even better than its older sibling. I read review after review of Two Towers with people saying this was the best film ever. Seriously?
I loved the eponymous books, despite not being much into the fantasy genre in general (exceptions: T. Pratchett, D. Adams), so the liberties with the original story were already something that I was not terribly happy about. But even aside from that, this sequel just does not cut it in terms of excitement.
If it weren't for the climactic ""Helms Deep"" battle, it could perhaps have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first 2 hours of Titanic. Come to think of it, even this grand finale epic battle is interrupted by the character which epitomizes the slowness of the rest of the film, Treebeard. The romance, or attempted romance, between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler is so irksome + pointless I wonder if it is included because Liv complained about getting a short shrift in screen time. There certainly wasn't any need for her character in this film because their romance is distinctly uncaptivating.
Golum etc are all created pretty well, and deserved the Oscar for effects, but it was hardly surprising to see this film skipped from all other major categories.

It's obvious that what we are rating here is not the DVD but the theatrical version of The Two Towers. I plan to wait till I see the DVD (which, if the FOTR extended DVD is anything to go by, is promising to be a work of art) to review it in November. For now, I will succumb to the temptation of putting in my two cents' worth about this movie. I'm not going to say that it's better than the first, simply because I regard it as a continuation of the same story. I won't try to persuade the disgruntled purists to lay off and realize that it is a film, a different medium and should be judged on its own merits. Many reviewers before me did a wonderful job expressing this point. I would like to appeal to those who, like myself, have loved the movie but have found some changes hard to accept, namely Faramir, Aragon's fall, etc. I must say I was quite shaken by the change in Faramir when I saw the movie for the first time. It took me a while to realize that what Peter Jackson and his team did here must have a reason, just like any other changes that they chose to make. The more I thought about it, the more I came to understand this choice. And this is where the Extended DVD will come in! Many of us know that with the extra 43 minutes of footage will come more character development. Faramir's relationship with his father will come to light. In all fairness, would it be realistic to expect that Faramir, who had such a great desire to prove himself to his father and to save his city, would pass up a chance to acquire The One Ring? I think that, once we see the extended film in all its glory, we will understand this and other changes much better. Remember how it was with the extended version of FOTR! And this is precisely my point: let's wait until the Extended TTT DVD comes out to really appreciate it (and don't forget the excellent bonus documentaries that are sure to please us fans!). Let's give Peter Jackson and his team the benefit of a doubt and an allowance for creative changes; surely they deserved at least that for sharing their talents and giving us the gift of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy!",1067126400,2,2243,4.255269320843091

1461005,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson has done it again.  If anything, The Two Towers is even better than Fellowship.  The movie has very few short comings.  I was a bit freaked out that the elves showed up at Helm's Deep but it worked.  The love story connection with Aragorn and Arwen is fine but somewhat  unneeded.  I didn't dislike it at all but the story didn't have to have it.  Gollum came off as ""funny"" sometimes and he is NEVER funny in the books but it worked.  The addition of the warg scene was excellent!  Though it is not in the books it makes sense and definitely gives a new vision of the Wargs when I read The Hobbit.  They are scary and done well.  I love the fact that this battle takes place in the daylight.  That was a very brave move of Jackson.  It is hard to hide special effect mistakes in the daylight.  There were no mistakes.  Even when fleet footed Legolus whips up onto the steed that Gimimli is riding it looks great.  Our elven friend, of course, steals the show yet again with his combat prowess.  The Ents are perfect, the settings are perfect, and the only character that comes off wrong is Farmir.  He is a bit of a jerk the entire time he is on screen.  The part is well acted but he was not the way he is portrayed in the book.  All in all that is minor but for those of us who are hard core, it did shake us up a bit to see him portrayed in that fashion.  The opening sequence with Gandalf fighting the Barlog is wonderful.  I do not think I breathed until it was over.  This set the tone of the movie which is far darker and more brooding than Fellowship.  Wars, death, and Frodo's encroaching near insanity, put this movie right where it should be.
 If I have anything negative to say it would definitely center around Faramir's character and the fact that Jackson felt that is was necessary to pretend that Aragorn had been killed in a fall while fighting the wargs.  This was totally unnecessary.  However, it was well acted and the reunion between legolous and Gimili and aragorn was wonderful.  There are some key scenes left out and I am awaiting the special edition on DVD to see what they put back in.  I expect that, like Fellowship, the DVD, director's cut will improve the movie even more.  All in all, this is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is so great to see fantasy taken seriously, finally, for once....I just hope Jackson isn't forgotten again for a Best Director award.  He certainly deserves it for crafting these...

1461006,5,B00005JKZU,"I absolutely adored this movie -- once I stuffed my inner pouty purist in a dark closet for the duration.
""What the--?"" screamed the corner of my brain that's read the trilogy a few dozen times, when Arwen made her appearance mid-movie.
""Shhh,"" the larger, happier lobes of my brain scolded. ""Hey, look! Wargs! Whee!""
It's a testament to Peter Jackson's genius that he's made a movie that almost everyone can enjoy, whether they've read the books or not. The same certainly can't be said for Tolkien in its purest form. People either love the books or loathe them -- although the movies have inspired several of my Tolkien-averse friends and relatives to take another crack at the trilogy.  And how great is that? The next generation of pouty purists is born!
The movie is a hell of a fun ride -- the battle for Helm's Deep alone is worth the price of admission. And if it strays from canon (or completely mangles poor Faramir. My poor, sweet Faramir...) believe me, it's a lot less painful for those of us who've read the books than a movie that's word-for-word faithful to the books would be to the average movie audience. (""Singing? Why the hell do people keep pausing every other scene to burst into song? Arrgh!"")
Meanwhile, I lurk with my finger poised over the ""add to cart"" button for the extended-version DVD to make its appearance.",1066953600,2,1341,4.658227848101266
1461007,4,B00005JKZU,"Even if you're going to buy the extended version, this DVD is worth the price. You get to see how Peter Jackson (and crew) squished a big story into a relatively short period of time. He takes a few different plot threads, running parallel, and lets them intersect. You never get confused. In fact, the whole story seems to take place in about four spots, in the same general area. (Looking at the Middle Earth map, that's more or less true.)
It's all in the editing. Watch as the movie progresses and it switches from one group of characters from another. At first, they get big, 20-minute chunks of time before the switch. By the end, you get a 1-minute update on Frodo and Sam, and then you switch back to Helm's Deep. The tension builds in three locations simultaneously, giving you three climaxes.
In The Fellowship, the plot was all about Frodo and the Ring. Each location --- from the Shire to Bree to Moria --- was in the story because Frodo was there. This time, the story is about the Fellowship working apart, all trying to achieve the goal of destroying the Ring, but from different locations. Frodo gets help from his friends even when they are many miles away.
The script adds a lot more humor than the previous movie, and battle scenes that are not in the book. But it works. For the second installment of the series, Peter Jackson was reaching out to the audiences who don't normally see sword & sorcery movies.
I'd give this five stars if the extras were better. The preview of Return of the King is very good. The rest isn't so interesting. I know they're not going to put the big 'making of' documentaries on this DVD, but they could have done more than throw in a few promo spots in which the actors talk about their love for each other.",1066867200,3,1757,4.459627329192546
1461008,2,B00005JKZU,"With films such as the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers, Matrix Reloaded and Attack of the Clones, one can't help but feel that the only reason these films are touted as 'epics' is for their length. For all of these boxoffice bonanzas, the marketing was there, but unfortunately the content wasn't.
So what makes filmmakers think they can waste three hours of our life capturing the so called 'epic' events that take place in middle-earth?
Apparently if you execute 20 or so panning shots of the New Zealand landscape, throw in some large scale live-action/CGI battles, add some two-dimensional characters that tend to talk more to themselves in profound long-winded statements rather than to each other, audiences won't mind - wrong.
Boring is the only way to define the effort that is Two Towers. Fellowship managed to effectively put the feeling at bay mainly because of the anticipation surrounding the film. But if Jackson felt he'd gotten over the character development of the first film only to bash as many swords and shields together for this installment, he sorely missed the point of producing an engrossing and entertaining film.
Divergent narratives are horribly mashed together, drawn out and consequently brain-numbingly boring. Who cares about what happens to Frodo - the only question I was asking was 'WHEN WILL IT END?' The romance between Aragorn and whatever her name was, fell completely flat, as did the reduction of Gimli's role from an entertaining dwarf in the first film to a victim of slapstick and cornball one-liners in this installment. (ala Jar Jar). Sure he could hold his own with his axe, but why did a pathetic attempt at humour have to accompany almost every strike with his weapon. If you laughed at his jokes btw, shame on you, and may the midget community swear vengeance upon your soul.
There's no denying that Jackson and his crew have put an aweful lot of work into this film, as seen in the extras included with the DVD - but appreciating a film is a lot different to enjoying a film, let alone enduring it.",1066867200,4,2057,4.830028328611898
1461009,5,B00005JKZU,"I am not a Lord of the rings fanatic, by any means. Nor am I much into fantasy novels, though I have read a few I liked. Yet I do enjoy movies like Willow or say Legend. So take into account that mine is the oppinion of an average person, and not someone who grew up with the books.
I found the first lord of the rings to be much less than I expected. Less action, less drama, and more time. It was long drawn out, and lacking in several areas. Now with the second movie from the trilogy, what we get is everything the first should have had and some more.
I have heard some oppinions that the two towers wasn't as good as the first, and had less action. Im no expert, but I found the exact opposite to be true. To me it seemed the first Lord of the Rings was merely setting the stage for the rest of the trilogy. Now with the second installment we are treated to much deeper character development and a much more involved plot. I also felt there was a lot more action too, as well as a much more epic scope and feel. The entire last hour of the movie is combat and action, as the Human and elvish forces attempt to hold out against a castle siege against grim odds (an army of 10,000 orcs!). The battle scenes are awesome and spectacular with lots of special effects and a massive feel. These will often leave you on the edge of your seat and were really well done.
In addition there is a much more dramatic, almost biblical feel to the movie. The characters such as Gollem (sp?) give outstanding perfomances and a few emotional and interesting moments that give the movie multiple dimensions and much more depth. The plot too will continue to thicken and because we are already somewhat familiar with the characters and world of middle earth - there is more room for develpoment here. While the Two Towers is even longer than the first Lord of the Rings, it doesn't feel as long because of the wider use of action, and a much more robust use of drama. Even the diologue feels much deeper and epic (for lack of a better word).
The visuals in the movie too, are completely off the hook. Breath taking scenery is omnipresent, and adds not only a wide girth of asthetic appeal, but also serves to bolster the more epic scope. The gorgeous special effects are also typically well done, and there is much more to be seen here than in the first.
I may not be able to compare the series to the books, but from my perspective the two towers was a much more enjoyable and a much deeper experience than the first. The best fantasy adventure movie since Willow.",1066867200,,2550,4.29253112033195
1461010,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is one of those where you don't really have to say, ""But that's not how it was in the book!"" Why? Because Tolkien's Lord of the Rings works for literature perfectly. But when it comes to film, a few adjustments must be made. And that's what Peter Jackson did, and rather well in my opinion. Still, the essence of Tolkien's epic, the despair of Theoden, the valor of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, the shrewdness of Wormtongue, are all portrayed in the film. And that's what counts.
The action was again good, but it doesn't get great until the end with the battle at Helm's Deep. It also mixes in a little humor, even though the movie in general is very dark and depressing.
Another thing I might point out was the excellent scene where Gollum debates with himself, and using different camera angles, it actually seems as if there are two Gollums yelling at each other. What I liked was that you feel such sympathy for the poor wretched creature.
But the best part was definitely the finaly 45 or so minutes. Where 10,000 orcs besiege Helm's Deep, and all seems lost, and the Ents march on bravely to destroy Isengard, and Frodo is an inch away from losing the ring to dark forces, they are all victorious. And in a speech where Sam pretty much sums up the theme of the movie and there are scenes shown of the good guys coming out victorious despite all the odds against them, you feel so inspired that you want to get up and do something since ""there is good in the world, and it's worth fighting for.""
I'm definitely seeing Return of the King.",1066867200,4,1554,4.456140350877193
1461011,4,B00005JKZU,"Considering the millions of people who've read (often at impressionable ages) the unique and genre-defining story, and the ambitiousness of trying to do it justice on screen, I've found much basis for credit in this production.  It shows skilled moviecraft in writing, production, and acting, and deals imaginatively and entertainingly with a challenging story.  (Many of those millions of Tolkein readers have written comments on the film, some of them asserting eloquent unawareness of the differences between a book and its movie adaptation.)  Yes, this (second) episode of the trilogy is realized with swordplay and Darth Vader helmets.  The episode entails the gathering and unleashing of a medieval world war.  On the other hand it connects skillfully with bits of history and drama that will touch many viewers uninterested in fantasy games (irrespective of Tolkein): the besieged outnumbered refugees in a mountain redoubt (Masada in AD 73, among other examples); British-looking crowds in underground tunnels (London, 1940); hints of the Shakespeare that many of the actors apprenticed on.  Most starkly and explicitly, Ian McKellen's voice at the end after a tactical victory: ""The battle for Helm's Deep is over.  The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.""  This is word-for-word and in exact cadence the famous BBC quote of Churchill after the Dunkirk miracle: ""... The battle of France is over.  The battle of Britain is about to begin.""  (This coined the phrase, and appeared in the 1969 film called, ""The Battle of Britain.""  McKellen himself certainly heard it, and might even have narrated it on occasion.)  Few British-commonwealth viewers will miss this reference, and many viewers around the world will spot tips-of-the-hat to movie genres as well as a respected face or two.  There's something for everyone, in other words.  Skateboarders included -- that's no crime.
(The only gross incongruity I saw was the command to archers to ""fire.""  It may be a small point to generations seeing lasers and phasers and Tasers, but any archer, including me, will tell you with dignity that no fire is involved, thanks.  Fire came into use in much later, chemical-propellant weapons which, for centuries, the operator shot by literally applying fire to, or ""firing,"" them.)",1066867200,3,2288,5.2445054945054945
1461012,4,B00005JKZU,"Like many other viewers of the film with a background in Tolkien, I was at first shocked by many of the changes made to the story to present it in film form.  However, I have finally come to terms with the ""changes"" in the movie.  I know that many folks were particularly horrified at the depiction of Faramir, stating that he was not as honorable as in the book - and didn't seem to be better than Boromir.  In some ways this argument is true.  However, if one consideres his character in the book, they will see that the film actually creates a very unique protrayal of Faramir.  Essentially, Faramir, portrayed as being very human rather than the quintessence of morality seen in the book, is brought to the point of making a decision about the ring, just as Boromir was.  Yet where Boromir failed through his greed and weakness, Faramir succeeded, and thus did prove to be the greater of the two.
My only problem with the film concerned the character of Aragorn after he fell off of the cliff and was rescued by Arwen via a horse named ""Brego"".  Who the hell is Brego and what is he doing in this film?  If you read the LOR companions you find that Brego was the second king of Rohan - he was never a horse.  Arwen does send a horse for Aragorn in The Return of the King.  His name is Roheryn, not Brego.
I did like the Ents, and I loved what Jackson did at the end of the film when Gandalf appears on the cliffs above Helms Deep.

Tolkien's work painted a very rich picture, with beautiful renderings of human strengths and weaknesses: nobility and greed; good and evil; honor, duty, and loyalty.  Much that was the best in the texture of story was ripped out or altered for no apparent reason.

I would very much hope that viewers were touched by Smeagol's plight, and Frodo's gradual losses of control. Smeagol was portrayed perfectly. His expressions look so human, that it's a wonder that he was computer generated. Frodo's 'posessed face', though not a great achievement in acting, was very amusing. The bettle for Helms Deep was also very strong. The hopelessness, the bravery, all were wonderful, and had us actually rooting for a victory for good.

The great quandry of an epic film is to sacrifice acting for effects.  Jackson has held true to the characters as well as the main story.

The truth is that you'll be closet fans of the films right to your graves.
Now the bad news.  Jackson has missed with the Nazgul (ringwraiths).  The films simply do not convey what powerful and menacing creatures they are in the books.

I loved the first movie. This movie is so-so. On one hand, I gave it 4 stars for the action scenes, some comedy, a great music score, and some great characters. The scenery is incredible, and the extras are pretty big. I watched the first special edition extras and they really show you that the movie takes a LOT of time. So basically you will want to check that out.
The subtracted star? I don't think that the Sam/Frodo parts were good enough to live up to the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli parts. I mean, it is really boring because Sam and Frodo have basically ZERO action scenes. They take around a rather annoying creature like dude called Gollum, who is just boring after a while. He isn't funny, and his mental psychotic scenes do tend to get old. The helms deep scene is the best, but then we have to switch over to feremir who will never live up to the great boromir.
I don't know, but whenever I skip across most of the ent/Sam and Frodo parts the movie is cooler. I don't read the books, but Aragorn and company have some of the coolest scenes ever and it is really a mood breaker when you have to watch some guys take around a mentally challenged Gollum.

1461283,4,B00005JKZU,"Looking at the size of the reviews on the page today, there are some strong opinions about this adaptation of Tolkien's books. My review is a little bit smaller.
It's good. It's not the book, but it's still good. No, it's not great; the true greatness shown in the books involved a lifetime of rewriting and world building, study and thought and rewriting again. Tolkein tinkered for DECADES over those books, that universe. Peter Jackson only had a couple years to try and take them and make them real, while dealing with budget, actors, and real life in New Zealand and Hollywood. So no, it's not the same. But.... darn good show, anyways. Glad I saw it, gonna watch it enough times over the years that it'll pay for me to own it on DVD.
So... if you're having trouble making up your mind, consider this: will you be renting it to watch more than once or twice in the next 10 years or so? If yes, shuck out the cash and buy your own copy. If no, then give your money to some video place and borrow their copy for a day or so.

December 2002, the second in the trilogy of movies from New Line, The Two Towers finally released to theaters, and into the waiting eyes and ears of millions. I was among the first of Americans to see the movie, on its second viewing in the United States. (I was there to see it the next morning when the office opened) When it released to DVD, I was among the last on the first day of its release to scoop it off the stand.
Of course, the second movie is pretty worthless unless you have seen the first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring. If you haven't, I'd suggest renting the extended edition DVD from your nearest store and viewing it first. (Make sure you get the ""Special Extended Edition"")
This is a review for those who still haven't seen it yet, and perhaps want to, or who are wondering what the mania is about. (Orlando Bloom)
PLOT: The Fellowship is dissolved. Boromir of Gondor fell in battle defending Merry and Pippin, hobbits of the Shire, from the Uruk-hai, blood-thirsty, maniacal orcs that have undergone a super-sizing courtesy of the traitorous wizard Saruman. Merry and Pippin were taken captive by these Uruk-hai. Aragorn the Ranger, eventual heir to the throne of Gondor, and his friends Legolas the Elf and Gimli the stout dwarf give pursuit to the Uruks in order to save Merry and Pippin. Frodo and Sam have departed on their own, bound for Mordor and the fiery Mt. Doom in the very center of the dark lord Sauron's realm - the one place where the Ring of Power can be unmade, thus giving victory to all the free peoples of Middle-Earth.
Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, in search of the hobbits, find themselves in Fangorn Forest, where they find Gandalf the Grey, who heroically withstood the hideous Balrog, and fell in Moria into darkness of Khazad-Dm. He is now Gandalf the White, more powerful than Saruman himself, victorious over death, sent back to life to complete his labors against Sauron. This foursome journey to the land of Rohan, to the Golden Hall of its King, Thoden. When Gandalf heals Thoden from the spells cast by Saruman spy Grima Wormtongue, Thoden comes to realize the great peril his kingdom already lies in, casts Wormtongue out of his kingdom, and leads his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep, on the heels of a massive hoard of Uruk-hai, an army bent on one purpose alone: dying. No! You'd think so the way they fight, but they are actually bent on destroying all the peoples of Rohan, and Mankind.
Frodo and Sam, meantime, have found Gollum, the twisted Ring-addict who attempts to take his ""precious"" back, but when dominated by the two hobbits, promises to lead them to Mordor.
GOOD: You might call be a little biased, because I'm a big Tolkien fan, but this movie is like nothing you've ever seen before. Quality of acting combined with ground-breaking special effects, set against the breath-taking landscape of New Zealand as Middle-Earth all come together to make the second of the three best movies in modern cinema. A spectacular musical score by Howard Shore merely ices the cake. The high points of the film include a battle at Helm's Deep that makes the Alamo look like a backyard game of cowboys and indians, and a last-ditch cataclysmic charge that is downright apocalyptic. Granted, ""Evil"" gets almost glorified in its ugliness, but there is an ultimate sense of Good for which every hero in Middle-Earth strives for, and in some cases, dies for. This is summed up in a poignant soliloquy by Sam after a particularly powerful demonstration of the terrible sway the Ring of Power possesses. When, in despair, Frodo laments ""What are we holding onto, Sam?"" Sam states in potent courage ""That there's some good in this world. And it's worth fighting for.""
As far as effects go, this movie is the cream of the crop. Orcs ride entirely computer-generated hyena-like wolves called Wargs. The Ringwraiths now  ride entirely computer-generated fell dragon-like beasts. The desiccated and psychotic dual personality of Gollum is created entirely by computer, and performed by Andy Serkis to perfection.
BAD: As said before, evil is a bulwark of a force to reckon with, and its ugliness is often glorified. One Uruk-hai beheads another and his macabre crew dine on the corpse. An Uruk head is later shown impaled grotesquely next to a pile of burning carcasses. In battle, both orcs and their steeds are slashed, hacked, beheaded, stabbed, beaten, pummeled, run through, pierced, skewered, cloven, chopped, sliced, speared, severed, axed, you name it. Though it must be clarified that in most cases the battles take place in low light, and we don't have massively explicit gore. However, these malevolent creatures are the epitome of evil, and are shown with a frightening realism that might frighten your small kids into sleeping in your bed for the next 14 years. (I personally won't go anywhere NEAR my Palantr)
THOUGHTS: Being a Christian, I've interacted with some who hate the Rings trilogy, and some who love it. Being that Tolkien was a Christian, and worked allegory into his work (whether he meant to or not, it's there), I think much of the ideas in the genre are downright Christian in their own right. Many contest the seemingly occultism and wizardry prevalent in the film(s). One must realize that these characters with this power are, if you study the histories of Middle-Earth, actually beings put on Earth by Angels to provide balance to the evil principalities. Understand that these wizards are not like pimply-faced Harry Potter at all. They have a design for existing: to take place in the battle against evil.
Excellent movie, entirely, and I recommend it highly, except for kids.",1066435200,11,5819,4.830661322645291
1461285,5,B00005JKZU,"One of the more frustrating things about reading the reviews about either of the first two Jackson-directed Lord Of The Rings movies is that a substantial portion of the population has tremendous difficulty understanding what an incredibly difficult job it has been to adapt such rich and complex literary masterpieces to the screen. The Lord of the Rings books have enough content to keep the imagination running for days and months, yet they also have the unique ability to teach us important lessons about the human condition.
  One reviewer wrote ""Jackson should just make the movies as Tolkien wrote them."" What said reviewer doesn't appear to realize is that the magic in Tolkien's work lies in its ability to interplay with the individual reader's imagination. In order to adapt in such a way, Jackson would have to have every perspective film viewer read the books, then give input into the adaptation. Even then, all viewers would have to have had the exact same experience while reading. Impossible.
  The other problem is that to cover all of the content in the books, each of the films would have to be many hours longer than they are.  Just like every other director, Jackson had a budget and time constraints. Since it would be impossible to do a completely loyal adaptation we have to look at and judge the movies within their own genre. Look at what has been accomplished. A coherent story (a miracle in and of itself) mixed with great acting, grandiose cinematography, and seamlessly blended special effects produce a truly amazing cinematic experience.  We experience everything from comedy to drama to fantasy to action in one experience.  While other directors seem to lose their films' humanity when integrating mind-blowing special effects (a certain G.

1461286,3,B00005JKZU,"When I went to see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" in the movie theater, I was absolutely speechless at the end of it.  I was so relieved, so encouraged by Jackson's interpretation of the novel I was beyond words.  But beyond that, I got the feeling that the people who made ""Fellowship"" really loved the story - a sense that they'd taken great care in filming it.
I do get that feeling at times while watching ""The Two Towers"", like during parts of the battle at Helm's Deep, but the rest of the film seems like ""Tolkien Lite"".  The sets and visuals were top-notch, but there was entirely too much cheezy dialogue that stood out painfully from the original source material.
It's not a bad movie, per se, but it's not as good as its predecessor, and it lacks the care and sensitivity that made ""Fellowship"" great.",1066348800,,806,4.506849315068493

1461289,5,B00005JKZU,"Well, I was thoroughly impressed with the artistic treatment of the Fellowship of the Ring, and found only editorial advantage to the screenplay. Peter Jackson's second volume-film makes a somewhat lukewarm book into a roaring movie, and the purist-decried changes to the text serve only to reign in JRRT's sometime excessive verbiage.
SPOILER:
Purists recoiled (I saw them do so in the theatre) when the unheralded horn blows before the assault on the Hornburg. It is testimony to Mr Jackson that, when the horn sounded, my mind said ""Elves!"", and, dammit, I was right, and the plot addition was exactly with the spirit of the story. The Free Peoples come to each other's aid, no matter their ethnic dislikes (was there a moral here?), according to the larger issues at stake. While it might be argued that Mr Jackson has let his romanciers run wild with the attraction between Arwen and Aragorn, it must be remembered that JRRT dealt with this in his appendices, and much would be puzzling to the viewer who has not read the text. The engagement between the Rohirrim and the wolf-riders was logically necessary as JRRT's poetry did not always serve military sense; a spoiling attack by Theoden's force was necessary to allow his people time to reach the Hornburg.
This is an excellent movie made out of a weak book, and wholly in the spirit of JRRT's overall work, if deviating from it in some necessarily dramatic details. The Return of the King promises to be a whopper.",1066262400,5,1474,4.807086614173229

I have read and love the books, and was mildly irritated (very at times) by some of the differences between the books and the movies.  I was particularly annoyed by the way the character of Faramir was portrayed in the movie.  I can't imagine how they plan to carry the Faramir they created in the movie over to the Return of the King while staying at all true to Tolkein's story.  That being said, I think what all fans of the books need to keep in mind when watching the movies is that it is not possible to stick to the story exactly - the movies would be both incredibly long and boring.  As much as I loved the books, there were parts of them that were slow moving.  This is acceptable for a book, even necessary, but not for a movie.  Everything needs to be more dramatic on screen.  In addition, Jackson has the unenviable task of appealing to both die-hard Tolkein devotees, of which there are many, and the general public at the same time.  I think we all need to cut the guy some slack.  So far, the movies are for the most part well-done, and I for one plan to see Return of the King on opening weekend!",1066176000,7,1212,4.230434782608696

1461292,5,B00005JKZU,"I've read the LOTR trilogy several times, and although the last time was many years ago, I can still remember most details of the storyline and the overall spirit of the books.  I've purposely put off reading the trilogy again until after ROTK debuts in December, to avoid being distracted by minor changes in the storyline.
The major departures from the storyline in TTT are noticeable but minimal.  Most importantly, none of the changes violate the essence of Tolkien's world, or the spirit of the characters, or the heart of the conflict that rages in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.  So what if there are Elves at Helm's Deep (other than Legolas) in the movie?  So what if the trees of Fangorn never make it to the Deep to take care of the fleeing host of Isengard?  So what if Faramir takes Frodo to Osgiliath before letting him go?  None of these changes wreck the story or make the movie any less enjoyable.
I suspect that these major changes were all driven by cinemagraphic factors.  I look forward to the Extended Version to see what comments Peter Jackson makes on these changes.  I thought his reasons for changes in the FOTR storyline were satisfactory.
The amazing thing about Jackson's work on LOTR is that he manages to keep Tolkien's overall epic AND his development of all the main characters in a format that only allows him to use a fraction of the LOTR text.
And the movie itself is awesome in its own right.  I saw FOTR twice at the theatre; TTT brought me to the big screen three times.  The special effects and panoramic views are without equal.  Howard Shore's score is phenomenal.
I don't understand why anyone (including the LOTR purists) wouldn't at least appreciate this film.  If you love Tolkien and can't stand any deviation from his original work, then I suppose you shouldn't consider buying this.  But if you love good movies, you should be able to enjoy The Two Towers whether you've read the books or not.",1066089600,3,1952,4.6231884057971016

The Fellowship has ended but there is much to be done.  Aragorn and company race to find Merry and Pippin, their missing Hobbit companions.
Frodo and Sam continue to make their way towards Mordor and Mt. Doom.  They are joined and led by Gollum.
Sauruman is increasing his power but making powerful enemies as well.
The lands of Rohan and Gondor are brought into war thus bringing most of Middle Earth into the growing conflict as Sauron gains power and looks for the Ring.
This is not the same story as the book, but it is close.  One major improvement was that the class difference between Sam and Frodo was far more obvious.  The special effects were quite good but many will complain about the major changes in plot (far larger than those in the first movie), but it works as a film as everything ties up at the same time and sets the stage for the final push in the third film.",1066089600,7,1095,4.348039215686274

Yes, there were some changes made from the book - but, hey, show many ANY BOOK made into a movie that does not not have changes?  None!  It's the nature of the game.  You cannot put a book - any book in it entirety on film, so stop the grumbling about how the movies is different from the book.  Judge the movie on the movie.  Period.
The actors continue with their high quality of acting.  The script is to fast pace I never notice how long the movie is.  There is less the gentleness of the first one, because simply they have moved passed the innocence of the shire and everyone awakening to the growing dangers.  The danger is now reached full power and Middle Earth must now battle to survive.
The movie is darker - as battle scenes should be - but the production value of the battle is floorings.  The extended version had over 45 more minutes of footages for those who cannot get enough.
Again, not for children.  This movie is even darker in tone that the first and the complexity of the story is just a bit much for children to understand and grasp the fasts violence.

This latest installment has lost the magic & sheer wonder of FOTR... None of the storytelling elements that made the first film so special are used in TTT...

1461437,5,B00005JKZU,"I've read Tolkien for the past 30 years--I'm a huge fan.  I am incredibly pleased with Peter Jackson's treatment of the material in these amazing films.  This is not only a momentous event in film-making history (shooting three films at once, with that many locations, extras, sets, miniatures, special effects, props, optical effects, etc.), but the majesty and timelessness of the story comes through extremely well.  This is an instant classic--something that generations will talk about.
I think I enjoyed this second part even more than the first.  With ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" we are introduced to the world, the characters, the society, and the story--but the character development and interaction which is necessary for us to be deeply involved has not had enough screen time... yet!  The Two Towers continues with this epic tale, cutting back and forth in an editing tour de force which keeps the pace quick and yet keeps the stories and characters and scenes unjumbled and clear.  We meet more charaters and creatures, and also get to know the personalities of the scattered members of the Fellowship as they begin to face greater and greater trials--which test their characters, heart and soul.
I saw the film in the theatres numerous times, and was always moved and in awe--of the event depicted and the breath-taking beauty of the New Zealand landscape that makes an appropriate backdrop for a story set when the world was young and great matters of heroism and treachery put the fate of entire civilizations and races in the balance.  So it was well worth it to me to spend money on a copy of the Theatrical version.
I will also purchase the Extended version, and eagery await the added wonders it will offer.  In this situation, it is purely win-win!!!",1065571200,4,1772,4.903010033444816
1461516,2,B00005JKZU,"Hopefully the extended edition will go miles to improve this poorly edited, sappy, confusing film. The Two Towers picks up right where Fellowship of the Ring ended and seemingly rushes to the ending credits as fast it can, leaving any sense of poignancy or emotion in the dust. Sure, there's lot's of sappy close-ups of terrified children and lovelorn faces -- but it means nothing because there was no time for anything resembling development. Perhaps there is no finer example of this false emotion than the ""heroic"" death of Haldir. He is supposed to represent an alliance that men and elves once shared, thus rendering his death tragic. But he is nothing in these films. His lines were few, his presense weak. Why should I care? Indeed, even Helms Deep suffers from this lack of resonance. It's eye-candy, to be sure, but where is the gut-wrenching mood? Where is the suspense??? Of course the disasterous idea to cut back and forth between the Ents and the battle does't help. Then there is the ridiculous, time wasting ""death"" of Aragorn. You've got to be kidding. It's so cheap and it merely distracts. We should have had more interaction between Sam, Frodo, and Gollum. But no. King Theoden's cheezball possession/exorcism sequence only begs questions. The FX, widely praised, are not so much terrible as they just look, well, unfinished. The wargs are a perfect example. The Ents come across as cartoonish, not majestic. And that was a mistake. Even Gollum is a hit and miss. Sometimes he works, sometimes he looks terrible.

I saw ""The Two Towers"" and I hated it. What the heck happened? The movie was just TOO dark in comparison to ""The Fellowship"" and none of the characters really seemed likable anymore. The acting was also really bad which is a shock if you consider how great it was in part one. Everyone just phoned in their performances. I was really looking forward to The Two Towers and I was really let down. There is only one good scene in the movie and that does not occur until the end of the film. The scene that I speak of is the ""Samwise speech"" scene. His words of advice are really great and they are what Frodo needs to hear in his darkest moment. This scene is really good and it is really touching to see friends work things out but it does not redeem this movie in any way.

To see the swarms of orcs and Uruk-hai throw themselves against the wall while the humans and elves try to repulse them is just one of the greatest screen experiences ever.  You won't be disappointed by it.
For me I was really impressed by the job done on Gollum.  In this movie Gollum is done as a CG character, but it's not at all cheesy.  Recently we have been bombarded with lots of uneccesary CG in movies, but you won't feel that way about this movie.  Particularly Gollum's facial expressions are excellent and the other character's reactions to him are very believable (maybe George Lucas should take a look at this film).  My favorite scene is when Gollum is have an internal conversation with himself.  As he plays the different sides of his personality, his expressions change so much that you almost feel as if it is a different character.  As I mentioned before the CG isn't as noticable as in other films, and the reason is that you just really caught up in the story.  It sweeps you away to another existance.  It's a shame there aren't more movies like this being made.  It's a real must see.  Check it out.",1065484800,,1387,4.4229249011857705
1461521,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson was given the, one might say, unenviable task of converting Tokien's literary epic into a mass-marketed Hollywood production, in a format both condensed changed in some content. It is perhaps the most difficult task to accomplish as a director - trying to portray an already much-loved and acclaimed book onscreen; Jackson, however, has done this with as much taste and ability as is possible.
  First though, to briefly list the hardcore Tolkien woes: The Ents, the Elves at Helms Deep (ugh!), Eowyn chasing after Aragorn, Faramir being seduced by the ring, no Shelob...phew. Lastly, as amazing as Gollum looks now, in ten years the CGI will look awful and ruin the whole film. But enough of the bad...
  The movie contains the most beautiful cimematography of this generation of film. The wide, Frank Capra-esque shots of rolling, snow covered mountains, forests, and grassy plains are simply beautiful. The arduous set construction pays off with locations that may as well exist in this world, as real as they look, particularly Theoden's Hall, where intricate stone and woodwork can be casually observed.
  The score is not the best ever seen in film, but wonderful in its subtleties. It wraps around the picture like a blanket, scarely noticable at times due to its pure cohabitation with the movie. When it needs to, it takes on a descisive thunderous quality, in keeping with the massive scope of The Two Towers.
  The cast of mostly B-list actors is excellent. Those that particularly shine are Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). Dourif is appaulingly haunting; his eyebowless countenance can be likened to a medieval Hannibal Lecter, preying on Eowyn's fears like a butcher-bird. Mortensen is massively confident, but without boasting; he takes the part and makes it his, with a classical maturity. Also noteable is Sean Astin's performance; his flawless rural English accent could so easily have nose-dived. Astin and Wood work to form a memorable onscreen chemisty, a classic good vs. evil struggle, relying on only each other.
  Perhaps the most brilliant achievement of Jackson is his creation of a vast, spawling, visually stunning epic that still manages to be a study of character. George Lucas should take note; the horror that was Episode 1 could and should have been like this. The story oscillates gently on Jackson's cognitive ocean; moving from Elrond and Arwen's moving last conversation, to the tumultuous Helms Deep; from the haunting sadness of Gollum, to the Ents' destruction of Orthanc. Directors these days seem to get carried away with their computer-endowed deity status, but Jackson uses it only as a tool to realize Tolkien's vision.
  The Two Towers is genius on film, poetry in motion. If those viewing it do not feel privileged, they are but fools, for they know not what they see. Buy this DVD and bask in its aura, put it on a plinth, and feel the radiating warmth. Buy it, buy it, buy it.",1065398400,3,2970,5.014227642276423

1461523,4,B00005JKZU,"I'm a huge fan of these movies and of the books, which I'd read several times before Peter Jackson adapted them to film. The Two Towers is a great film in its own right, but I do take issue with some of the liberties Jackson took in bringing this from novel to script. Of course some liberties need to be granted - after all, the elements that make a book a masterpiece are usually the same elements that make a film terrible. But in my opinion Jackson crossed the line in more than one area where he didn't need to.
First, Faramir. His character is completely different than Tolkien intended. Tolkien likened him to a wizard in his wisdom and actions. In the book, Faramir seizes Frodo and intuitively knows he carries the ring. He is never tempted to take it from him and understands immediately the consequences of possessing it. He is in every way, shape and form the opposite of his greedy, power hungry brother, Boromir, who tried to steal the ring in the first film. I think that making Faramir struggle as he does in Jackson's Two Towers dramatically takes away from the character's brilliance and only turns him into a cheap plot device to stall up Frodo's quest instead of letting us witness wisdom and selflessness at its finest.
Second, the Ents. These giant trees are supposed to be the wisest of all things living, as Tolkien intended. In his books they arrive at the conclusion that they must go to war for all living things are affected by it. However, Jackson has them decide to abandon Middle-Earth and only after being tricked by the hobbits Merry and Pippen do they decide to fight, and then it's for the selfish reasons of seeing their own kind hurt by Saruman. Again it's my opinion that Jackson cheapens a character and turns them into a lame Hollywood plot device.
Lastly, the Elves. Tolkien has them abandon Middle-Earth except for Elrond's sons. Jackson sends an entire army of Elves to aid at Helm's Deep. This was a huge liberty to allow Jackson, since it entirely changes the character and motivation of the Elves.
There are many fine points to the film, not least of all Gollum. The blend of CGI and reality make for a one-of-a kind character. The performances are great from all the cast, but I do think that Eowyn was the weakest of the bunch casting-wise. She doesn't even really compare to Liv Tyler and it's not very believable that there would be a love triangle between her, Arwyn and Aragorn.
Finally, the music was better than the first film, and I must say it was the first film's biggest weakness. The main title sounded like something I'd expect to hear on ESPN's Baseball Tonight. Very generic melodies. They should've gotten a bigger name to handle the scoring.
All in all, it's a great movie of course, but with more blatant flaws than its predecessor. The pace never feels quite right, since we are cutting incessantly from lengthy dialogue scenes between the Ents and the Hobbits to action packed battle sequences at Helm's deep. The film also ends somewhat abruptly. Most of us were expecting to see a spider. I'm sure Jackson had his reasons, but to me it didn't feel right.
I'd have to say I was disappointed in this, especially after how amazing the first one was. But of course, I'll be first in line to see Return of the Kind this December.",1065312000,19,3293,4.592529711375212
1461524,5,B00005JKZU,"I have always been a big fan of SciFi and Fantasy genre movies. I saw the movies before I read the books. I think that was the way to go because I loved the movies and then the books had so much more detail and slightly different twists in the story but basically the same. Here are the things that struck me most in the Two Towers:
- Graphics were great as usual.
- Gandalf returns more powerful that ever.
- Aragorn walks in thru the double doors at Helm's Deep
- The Warg battle had great CGI
- Gollum rocks (Andy Serkis was great as the talent behind gollum
- The Battle Helm's deep was overwhelming. I love seiges.
- Gandalf rides downhill to kick some Uruk and Orc butt !!!
Overall, though there were many additions and many deletions to certain story elements within the books, I think as far as making a movie and captivating a movie going crowd as well as the not so fussy majority of the tolkien fan base, Peter Jackson did a helluva job. The plot of the moive was well thought of and I welcome the changes that saved us from too much detail as in the books. I like reading the books and imagining things and thats where detail helps, not in the movies. But the movies have a great amount of detail too and the Extended Edition always satisfies that desire for a little bit more. I plan to own both the theatrical and extended versions of all three movies. I wish they would have made the Hobbit also...... now I'm aksing for too much :-)
I would give this movie and the extended a hundred stars if I could, but I guess five will have to suffice for now..",1065225600,,1565,4.22

At risk of losing my geek cred, I have never read the Lord of the Rings books (I may yet, though), but the films in this series have just blown me away.  I am especially impressed by Gollum, even though he bears a startling resemblence to someone I know.
And as for the ""Tolkien Purists""...please be mindful of the different challenges that the film medium imposes.  Try to appreciate Peter Jackson's staggering achievement for the labor of love it is.  The Lord of the Rings is not history, it's a series of novels (i.e., the comment one reviewer made about Aragorn and ""a battle he wasn't even in"").

1461701,3,B00005JKZU,"I think it would be difficult to dispute that Peter Jackson is an excellent director. However, what remains to be seen is whether or not he is an excellent interpretor, and this seems to be the root of the mixed criticism regarding the second in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Two Towers"". When Tolkien first published this epic trilogy, he honed every nuance and every phrasal reference to what he believed ""worked"" within the context of the books. As a professor of English, he could certainly do no less, and he protected his writing from publisher's changes.
Transferring a novel to a film will, of course, require modifications as what ""works"" on a page will not always work on screen. To this end, I believe the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" did a fantastic job, and retained the essence of the novels without betraying their thematic elements. However ""The Two Towers"", while visually appealing and ultimately epic in scope, almost seems a change in trend in the style of interpretation. As other reviewers have mentioned, elements such as Faramir's character, the battle of Helm's Deep, details regarding Isengard etc. were all massively rewritten to the point where themes were actually changed. Case in point, a central theme of nature (represented by the Ents and their forest), vs. industry (the Orcs), demonstrated in the novel by the Forest ""consuming"" the Orcs of Isengard destroying Saruman's army at Helm's Deep is somewhat uncreatively replaced by the elves coming to Man's rescue in fighting them off.
Whether or not such revision is good or bad for the sake of the audience is a moot point, as ""The Two Towers"" was even more successful than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". But films are a form of artistic expression, just as novels are, and when art imitates art, moviemakers must be careful not to paint over the authors work, while keeping the signature intact.",1065139200,3,1882,4.884375

1461703,5,B00005JKZU,"'The Two Towers' - being the second movie in a tirlogy - is in a natural position to be a disappointment. It doesn't have the benefit of being 'new' (and therefore surprising) like the first, or being as grand as the third. But this wasn't a disappointment - at least to me. Nothing I can write here can convince any of the purists that resented the changes Peter Jackson & co. made to the story are OK. I hope they fel better knowing that The Two Towers was the farthest away the crew strayed from the original book. I still enjoyed it, regardless of the changes, and I'm looking forward to the extended version.
This brings me to the only thing I found worth complaining about: the extra features are some of the worst I've seen on DVDs. The only one worth watching was the Return of the King preview. As for the rest - it would've been better to have no features at all. Most of them seem to be either the crew excitedly telling us how great Return of the King is going to be, or something to do with Sean Austin's short movie 'The Long & The Short Of It"". With all due respect to Mr. Austin and his work, I don't find his work to be relevant as a part of this DVD. I'm sure the special extended edition of this movie would contain awsome features (jsut as the last one did), and the studio had les us know about the editions in advance, but it still doesn't feel good to buy a 'fanccy' 2 disk set, with the 2nd only containing about 5 - 10 minutes of something worth watching.

1461806,1,B00005JKZU,"I am astounded that with all of the resourses at his disposal, with all of the amazing hard work that was put in to getting the sets, costumes, props, etc right (and at least visually, I think just about everything is very faithful to the books), this is the best Peter Jackson can come up with. Setting aside the creative license for a minute, this movie is a rather dreary compilation of sweeping, brooding wide-angle landscape shots, coupled with some rather goofy dialogue that never gives you more than a surface glance at the characters. Oh, and the battle scene. Sure, it looks good. That's really all one can say about it. Truth be told, this movie rather reminds me of ""Willow"" with computer graphics.
But I don't want to set aside the creative license, because I am also a flag-nailed-to-the-mast purist. I will grant you that some editing has to be done to fit 1500 pages or so of close text into a screenplay. Fair enough. But Jackson didn't just edit the story, he changed fundamental parts of it. And he certainly seems to have found room to add a lot of things. Other reviewers have catalogued these edits pretty well, so I won't repeat them. I will simply say that, on a deeper level, Jackson either doesn't understand or else doesn't care about the things that make Tolkien's story unique and separate it from any other fantasy/adventure.  Jackson might just as well have produced a movie based on a Dungeons and Dragons game.  That way, he could have used all of his whiz-bang special effects and Maxfield Parish-meets-Enya production stunts without dragging poor old Tolkien's name into it.

1461807,5,B00005JKZU,"I've read the J.R.R. Tolkien books. I've seen the two movies. I've enjoyed all of them greatly so far. Peter Jackson had made another hit to add to his resume, in one of the best movies of this new century.
The Two Towers continues the journey to destroy the ring that was started in the Fellowship of the Ring. The movie is basicly three stories happening in one. You have Mary and Pippin who were captured by Orcs in Fellowship. They are now traveling across middle earth with the Ents(Giant Walking Trees). You have Aragon, Leoglas, and Gimley who go to Helms Deep to help the people of Rohan fight off the army of Isengard. Then you have Frodo and Sam making there journey to Mordor where they pick up another traveler Gollum.
Thats a basic overview of the movie made in three short sentences.
The action scenes are my favorite part of the movie. The fight at Helms Deep is fantastic. Peter Jackson and his special affects team WETA are outstanding. The fight is so realistic looking between the 10000 orcs and 300 men and elves. It's hard to believe half of that was all digitally made.
Gollum is another highlight of the movie. His split-personality will leave you in laughter. It's superb acting.
The music is great in the movie. Howard Shore has made a beautiful soundtrack for this movie. It's good enough that you'd think it was done by John Williams.
I can't really say more except I love this movie. I'm looking forward to Return of the King. Don't miss out on owning this movie. It would be a great addition to your movie collection",1064793600,2,1545,4.541218637992832
1461808,4,B00005JKZU,"This movie was very different from FoTR, in many ways. First of all, the movie and book is mostly battle. The battle of Helm's deep is probably the focal point of the entire movie, so the movie is significantly more violent than the first. If you're faint at heart, and don't like seeing orcs die, then you might want to consider watching ""Bambi"" or something else instead.
The cinematography in the movie was...once again, astounding. One particular shot that runs in my mind is when Aragorn retraces the steps of Merry and Pippin...the flashbacks between Aragorn (present) and Pippin and Merry (past) are excellent. A few other notable shots include when Aragorn picks up the Lorien Leaf that the hobbits leave behind; when Aragorn walks through the double doors, and (this one is incredible) when Frodo attacks Samwise (watch his blade..this shot is incredible). Of course the landscapes and the battle scenes are great too, those are just a few particular shots that I remember.
There are several things that I really loved and enjoyed about the movie. I'll make a brief list of them here:
-The introduction starting outside the mountain hearing what is going on inside and then Gandalf falling/fighting the Balrog
Grima Wormtongue. Perfect casting..you couldn't get any slimier than that!
-The Wargs (though they sort of looked too cute...)
-The ents...oh my..the Ents were spectacular.
-The destruction of Isengard! I just wish they would have shown more of it.
-The battle of Helm's deep. I know this is like half the movie...but it was great!
There were a few changes from the book, but I won't mention them (I don't want to spoil the movie too much). I'll back up every (almost) change that Jackson made...even what Jackson did to Faramir.
There weren't too many things I didn't like..but the first and foremost is probably the Entmoot...that is the one change that I think Jackson shouldn't have made. Also...we didn't get to see Treebeard's ""house."" That was a shame. I really wanted to see the table and the Ent draught. I also didn't like the dwarf tossing joke (yes..*another* dwarf tossing joke...sheesh!) and I didn't like what Frodo saw in the Dead Marshes.
Peter Jackson (even he admits this), took more creative liberties with this movie than any of the Lord of the Rings films (released and unreleased). Knowing this before I saw the movie, I was a little worried. I figured he had cut something big out...or added something stupid in. But, in the end, I can appreciate almost all the changes he made (with the possible exception of the entmoot), and I think this movie was once again a winner! Thanks to everyone who made it! It was great!",1064707200,3,2660,4.848351648351648
1461809,5,B00005JKZU,"Without doubt, the Two Towers ranks among the most accomplished epic films ever produced.  It is a superb achievement, and watching the DVD is pure enjoyment.  Despite the movie's many departures from the book, overall the high quality of the production still does justice to the story.  We all know the technical limitations of bringing such a complex and intricate literature to the screen, and a movie is a different medium from a book. The changes highlight the more dramatic parts of the tale, and most can be forgiven (except perhaps a few silly melodramatic moments like the two peasant kids from the Westfold being parted from their mother, that the movie could do better without).  The inner details may be changed, but the broad outlines of the painting remain faithful.
Like the Fellowship of the Ring, everything about TTT is first-rate, down to the last detail, with spectacular cinematography and special effects, and great acting.  The winning performance, interestingly, is that of Gollum: the CGI is almost perfect, and the facial expressions, voice and acting (by Andy Serkis) impressively portray the creature as the ultimate addict, and his struggle to redeem himself.  In contrast, Elijah Wood's performance of Frodo is disappointing: his portrayal of the gradual corruption of Frodo's spirit by the ring is limited to looking stressed-out and rolling his eyes up.
The movie is very fast-paced with three story lines, and unlike the Fellowship, which has more charm, there isn't much opportunity for character development (especially and unfortunately for Faramir).  But the focus is no longer on Frodo, thus allowing more chance for the other characters to shine.  More speaking parts for Legolas (to the delight of his fans), making him less aloof and more ""human"" (such as his despair before the battle) hence more intimate.  Similarly with Gimly, Merry, and Pippin, we see more of their characters coming out than in the first movie.
The battle scenes are a bit prolonged and may be too violent for younger viewers, but well done.  Peter Jackson balanced the intense battle actions with emotionalism, such as the despair of facing impossible odds, in Theoden's monologue and his question, ""what can Men do in the face of such reckless hate?"" (a question that is all the more present in these days of terrorism).  The involvement of the elves is another departure that has often been lamented, but one that is actually not too far from the book: in preparing for the battle at Helm's Deep, Legolas had wished for 100 archers from Mirkwood to help with the defenses.  Tolkien meant the war of the rings to be between the race of men and evil forces, without the interference of the elves, who are no longer concerned with the affairs of humans as they're leaving Middle Earth.  But there are exceptions, as when Elrond sends his two sons to fight alongside Aragorn in the last battle.  The movie version expands on this, with Elrond sending elves to aid in the battle of Helm's Deep.  It is a touching addition, but not without a sense of futility.  Haldir's death is particularly poignant, as he fell wondering why the sacrifices of so many elves, otherwise free to leave Middle Earth.
The theatrical version of the DVD is certainly worth watching and owning.  However, with the upcoming extended version that promises to be richer and more enjoyable, it is a difficult decision whether to suggest purchasing both versions or waiting for the extended version.",1064620800,2,3483,4.977586206896552
1461810,3,B00005JKZU,"First of all, I will not read over 1100 reviews to see if anybody else mentions these two problems, so I will state them for what they are worth and hope to appeal to those who do not confuse ""helpful"" with ""he agrees with what I think.""
I realized half way through the first episode that I could not understand or hear more than half of the dialogue. This recent trend of whispering lines has reached nonsensical proportions in all films today. It was only an hour into Two Towers that I noticed I could bring up English subtitles. Now, that I should need them at all for a film that is supposed to be in English is disgraceful. Perhaps in a theatre, this problem would not be as acute; but a DVD should at least be audible, despite the Director's attempts to make it otherwise. (If an animated character like Gollum is utterly incomprehensible, then that is the fault of the Director also, not of the DVD.)
The second problem is that films like these become a matter of ""Look what my computer experts can do!"" rather than relying on human actors and ingenious directing. It is all very imposing for a few moments and then you realize how little STORY is being told while long sequences of obviously computer-animated individuals or armies are trying to make you feel you are getting your money's worth.
I know this will interpreted as an attack on beloved child by many readers who have never known what magic films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"" can accomplish with purely human resources, squares screens and black and white film.

A good book is more than just a general story with lots of easily discarded detail. The details are what make the story unique. In Peter Jackson's powerful mass-consumption version of The Two Towers, the details are changed (Theoden refuses to confront Saruman's forces, preferring to hide in Helms Deep), mangled (Pippin fugures out a way to 'convince' Treebeard to strike against Saruman), twisted (Faramir shows no quality and instead takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath), created without sense (Aragorn falling off a cliff) and completely left out (too numerous to mention). The list goes on and on. In fact, anyone who HAS actually read the book, will note that there is not one scene that captures the depth or beauty of Tolkien's work, despite New Zealand's breath-taking landscape. EVERY scene is different from the book. From what the characters say to what they do and why they do them. The only scene worth any acclaim is the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog at the beginning of the film. Interestingly, this is the only scene that Tolkien didn't describe in detail, but one that Jackson visualised perfectly. To truly do the book justice he should have refrained from altering what was already perfect and stuck to bringing THAT to the fore, rather than this watered down, unremarkable, run af the mill, fantasy flick. One day a version will be produced with less reliance on the child-pleasing special effects and more on the characters and the life-inspiring dialogue which makes Tolkien's masterpiece stand alone and tall among many giants of the grand art of storytelling.

He needs to give regular viewers more credit, and realize that it is the hard-core fans of the books, the ones that have been following the making of the movie for years, that are going to keep it successful.  There is nothing wrong with the original story, and modifying it only lessens it's impact.  All that aside, the movie was very well done and very entertaining.

The only reason I gave this 2 stars was due to the incredible sets and graphics involved in recreating Tolkien's world. But it ends there. I was bored through the entire movie, they played this sappy music over and over trying to create heart-felt moments until at some point, you just stop caring. The director didn't understand the concept of building to emotional or action climaxes.
Now I've always been a big Tolkien fan since I started reading, yet I'm not against changing the story when it's moved to film because it's necessary in order to cram that much content into a shorted period. However, the changes made baffled me. For instance, The men of Gondor run into Frodo and Sam and decide to take him back instead of allowing him to continue on his mission, just to change their mind later. This doesn't change the story to shorten it; what it does is alter a character for the worst. This was Borimeir's brother, the original point was that he was different and passed the test of the ring (not give into temtation) which gives you an idea of the strength of character for the last movie. Instead, they made him the same as any other mortal.
Then what happened to the forest attacking the Oruik High at Helms deep, I don't see any other way of defeating 10,000 brutal monsters. Or the Ents deciding to stay out of the war, just so they could waste more screen time while two hobbits trick Tree beard into seeing the destruction. How is it that all the Ents showed up 2 seconds later for the attack? I have to end this because I could talk all day about how this movie sucked.",1064361600,9,1676,4.498360655737705

I guess what I'm trying to say is: Peter Jackson is moving film in the right direction with this movie, in both it's atmosphere and content. Definite 5 stars.",1064188800,,630,4.7889908256880735
1462038,5,B00005JKZU,"I have not had the opportunity to view the extended version of LOTR The Two Towers yet, but I am 100% positive that it will only be more breathtaking than the theatrical release.  This movie is one of the most astounding undertakings in film history since the days of classics like Cleopatra, The Ten Commandments and Star Wars.
Peter Jackson has taken an epic tale, which admittedly I was never able to stay awake long enough to read, and turned it into a trilogy that I am sure has as much if not more dramatic impact on its audience as the literary work itself.  And hats off to Jackson for his excellent attention to detail.  He could easily have created Middle Earth in the bowels of a computer program, but he wanted something tangible that his audience could believe in, so he demanded models, models, and more models, and hundreds of extras, and scads of the best camera tricks, and acres of perfectly prepared land to build authentic sets on (every inch of which he retored to its original condition when he was done by the way), and the list of his achievements goes on.
Some of us were waiting for George Lucas to re-enter the arena as god of the film epic the summer before LOTR The Fellowship made its appeareance, and were more than sadly disappointed with his oversue of special effects and lack of characterization.  We plodded away from the theatre sure that computers had rendered a good old fashioned epic film impossible now.  Doubting Thomas's, we entered the theatre and were blown away by THe Fellowship.  And then we were blown away again with the Two Towers.  I have to say that I am ecstaticly anxious to see THe Return of the King, but at the same time I don't want it to happen because then the epic will be over.  The story will be told, and the characters will drift away into history, remembered, but never seen again.  I have no doubts that Return of the King will blow its audience away yet again.
I can only say that the Two Towers was one more step up on the scale of film making, hard to top, but Jackson has what its takes.  He has created a movie so rich in story, character, setting, and atmosphere that it is nearly impossible to believe that Middle Earth isn't on the airlines list of most popular places to visit.  I will say that the second movie was much darker and bloodier than the first, an objection voiced by a few people I attended shows with, but every ounce was neccassary to tell the story and that is what's important.
I can hardly do this film justice with my own words, so just buy it and watch it, and watch it again, and again, and again...Hey, I saw it in the theater 9 times at 7 bucks a ticket!  What else needs to be said? Buy it!  Watch it!  Love it!",1064102400,3,2713,4.378486055776892
1462039,5,B00005JKZU,"Tolkien's saga comes to life with an array of wonderfully talented scenery, dialogue, directing, and acting. Make-up and costumes are splendid, and the set is incredible.
Filmed in New Zealand, Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, along with Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Ian Mckellen, to name a few, puts together another masterpiece. Though the first was remarkable, The Two Towers captivates the audience in a way that the Fellowship of the Ring cannot.
Split from their friends, Frodo and Sam set out on their own to destroy the ring. Frodo is beginning to feel the power of the ring, he is starting to realize that he cannot make the journey. It is too hard on him and he doesnt know the way. Just when things are getting hard on the two Hobbits, someone unexpected and unwelcome shows up. Gollum. Making a deal with the poor creature, Frodo and Sam follow Gollum to the Gates of Mordor, determined to get inside.
Merry and Pippin are in the hands of the Orcs, being carried to Saruman, who is slowly taking over Rohan for his own evil bidding.
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are in search of Merry and Pippin, ready to free them from their captors at the slightest chance they get. And on the way they meet someone they do not expect.
An enjoyable film, the Two Towers goes beyond expectations into a movie that everyone will enjoy. Fun for mature children and their parents, a great film!!!",1064102400,,1434,4.67193675889328
1462040,5,B00005JKZU,"I decided to watch this movie after seeing the first one and knowing this was going to be a briliant trilogy.  As soon as the movie started I knew it was going to be another excellent movie. The storyline is amazing. Its like you have explored a totally different world and after the film is over - you crave for more. I wanted to see it again and again. I would definetly buy this film or at least see it, its worth your time money and even a little more!
Overall: Excellent! Its a must see!",1064016000,,492,4.125
1462041,5,B00005JKZU,"WOW!And I thought the FOTR was good!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best sequal EVER made! The acting,visual effects,direction,everything is so mucher better than the first(well,except for maybe the story. I think the first one had a better story).They made a few changes from the book,but it is still an enjoyable movie. I can't wait for The Return of The King on December 17. See this,but see the first one first because you wiil be REALLY confused if you don't. A must see!!!!!",1064016000,,471,4.9
1462042,5,B00005JKZU,"Yes, the title says ""Countdown to November"", not December, when the ""Return of the King"" finally hits the big screens, but November, when fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy can get their hands on ""The Two Towers: Special Extended Edition"", the entire movie that includes over forty minutes of extra film footage included in the theatrical release version. Many may think this review is not helpful (mostly because its being written before the Special Edition is for sale), but its here because many people are buying the standard theatrical version, seemingly without realising that a better and bigger edition is on its way. The 'sneak preview' for the Extended Edition - or the advertisment for it, if you prefer - can be seen on the theatrical release DVD, just as the the Extended 'Fellowship' preview was on last year's DVD, and if you fell into the trap of having to buy two DVDs in 2002, then don't let it happen again with ""The Two Towers""!
My suggestion is to rent the theatrical release, in order to enjoy the movie and the special features, including trailors, interviews, music videos, and previews of both the Return of the King and the Extended Edition. This should whet your appetite and anticipation long enough for November, when you can purchase the four-disc set with all its extra goodies. The only reason I'm writing this warning is that my father almost brought the theatrical release DVD, but was very relieved afterwards when I warned him and we ended up renting it, wherein he saw the preview for the Extended Edition. His exact words were: ""I would have been so annoyed if I had brought this version!""
For those who don't already know, the Extended Edition is set to be excellent. The ""Fellowship"" Extended cut had only thirty minutes of extra footage - here we get forty! Included in the cut (and this information is taken from the DVD preview and many internet sources) are:
* Merry and Pippen growing taller due to Treebeard's Ent-draughts.
* the stunning and elabourate funeral of Theoden's son Theodred.
* a pivotal 'flashback' scene between Boromir, Faramir and their father Denethor in Osgiliath, which clearly shows the somewhat strained family dynamic, and may help to make Faramir's motives in forcefully taking Frodo and the Ring to his city more sympathetic.
* Saruman looking over a book that identifies Aragorn as the ""Lost King of Gondor""
* Frodo, Sam and Gollum escaping from Osgiliath via the sewers
* Merry, Pippen and Treebeard exploring the ruins of Isengard (and finding its larder!)
* The Ents (or was in the Huorns? - sorry, I can't recall) rounding up the last of the orcs on the borders of Helm's Deep.
* Eomer finding his cousin wounded in the orc ambush
* Gandalf and Aragorn discussing his fate
* Sam and Frodo using Galadriel's elvish rope to scale a cliff-face
* Aragorn taming the deceased Theodred's horse Brego and releasing him into the wild (yes, that's the horse that rescues him after he falls off the cliff)
* Legolas and Gimli sitting amoungst the dead orcs outside Helm's Deep after the battle.
* Aragorn reluctantly swallowing a stew that Eowyn has dished up.
* Faramir finding the boat containing Boromir's body and the Horn of Gondor cloven in two.
* More Aragorn and Arwen love scenes (*rolls eyes*)
These are the main ones, to the best of my memory, but certainly not the only ones - there should be more dialouge inserted into already existing conversation, more battle scenes, and of course added music composed by Howard Shore. The Countdown begins to November...",1063929600,7,3540,4.804918032786885
1462043,5,B00005JKZU,"I loved LOTR, the book & the movie. The movies were both easily the best of the year respectively. Everything fit perfectly. The CGI Gollum, as well as all of the effects. As far as the DVD is concerned I was very happy that ALL of the DVD is closed caption not just the movie, which is great for hearing impaired & people like myself who have some difficulty hearing subtle audio parts. The only criticism I have is the DVD needs a play all like the first did.",1063843200,4,461,4.191011235955056
1462044,5,B00005JKZU,"Once in awhile, you see a movie that just absolutely blows you away.  It carries you away emotionally as you get involved in the story, and it also astounds you for the achievement in moviemaking that it is.
THE TWO TOWERS does this perhaps better than any film I've seen.  It's not the best acted movie in history (Liv Tyler is a bit one note, Miranda Otto a bit bland), but from a technical standpoint, I'm not sure you'll find a better film.  Just the achievement of Gollum alone is astounding.  I saw (to my chagrin) THE HULK, and there's a great example of how a digital creature doesn't work.  Or the three-headed dog in the first Harry Potter movie.  Or even the Cave Troll in the first LOTR.  You may suspend your disbelief, but in the back of your mind, you know the creature is computer generated.  Gollum just can't be fake...can he?  After about two minutes on screen, you totally forget he's a computer fabrication.  And when he has his ""close-up"" scene, when he argues with himself, the performance is amazingly convincing. Gollum is breath-taking.
And the Battle of Helm's Deep.  Wow!!  Not sure there's anything else to say.  It's on a par with the Chariot Race in BEN-HUR as a classic of excitement and craft.
But the story itself is told with such obvious loving care that we become emotionally wrapped up in the story.  It has a grand sweep to it, sure, but it feels personal too.  Peter Jackson is to be highly, highly commended.  And surely, when RETURN OF THE KING is released, he will finally get the Oscar he deserves.
The DVD's are astounding too.  The Deluxe DVD set for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING with all the restored scenes and documentaries is the greatest DVD in my collection, and I have hundreds of films.  It totally and completely lives up to the promise of the DVD format.  Why don't more films restore their deleted scenes back into the movie instead of having you watch them out of context later.  Perhaps it's because those scenes actually deserved to be deleted???  In LOTR, the restored scenes simply added depth, character development and MAJESTY to the epic film.  These are must-have DVDs.  I have seldom been so enthralled with a motion picture.  I just can't imagine how anyone can give this film less than 5 stars.
NOTE:  I'm not a Tolkien fan.  I can't get through the books.  I don't even know how the story turns out.  But from what I gather from talking to fans of the books, reading online and such, the changes Jackson made to the story are all justified from a cinematic story-telling sense.
PS: The shot of Orlando Bloom flipping himself onto his running horse...that's probably worth the price of admission right there!!!",1063756800,2,2673,4.617834394904459
1462045,5,B00005JKZU,"First of all let me say I think the books are without equal and yes I know this movie changed a few things from the book.  However bearing in mind they had a mere 3 hours to cover the material and the brilliant quality of the film. I for one, am more than prepared to forgive them.
A few years ago this movie would have been impossible to create, the special effects that now make it possible like the massed army in the Battle of Helms Deep are nothing short of mind blowing.  The quality of the story despite it being altered a little from the book is as most non puritanical people concede without equal.  I think the casting is terrific and the acting excellent, particularly in the case of Gollum (Andy Serkis).
The location could not be bettered, New Zealand seems so perfect for the movie.  I found the beautiful scenery an added bonus I had not considered when I first started to watch The Fellowship.
I think these will movies bring this tremendous work to a whole new audience who may not be readers, or who may not be attracted to older classic novels. This alone makes the films worthwhile as a project, quite apart from the superb entertainment they bring to the open minded.
I think Tolkien would have approved and been astounded that such a monumental undertaking was even attempted. I also think he would have applauded the product, a nine hour movie that I believe, in time will be as loved and cherished as his temendous novels.  Surely the greatist cinematic achievement of all time.
I cannot wait for the third movie, so I can pull the phone out of the wall, lock the doors and watch the complete nine hour epic in one hit.  Ecstasy!",1063756800,5,1653,4.456953642384106
1462152,5,B00005JKZU,"We all walked out of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" thinking, ""How can this get any better?""  Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that it can.  ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" has greatly surpassed all expectations and defied any doubts that I ever had about this film.  Simply put: this is the best film of the year and was unjustly robbed of the Best Picture Oscar.
Fans of the first film definitely had their doubts.  And who could blame them?  We've suffered through a countless number of rotten and disappointing sequels within the past few years (ahem: Star Wars, Jurassic Park 3...).  Audiences worldwide were overjoyed at what they got.
""Two Towers"", thankfully, picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship"" left off.  The Fellowship is broken.  Sauron's forces begin to amplify and his allies grow. Saruman's immense army mass towards the City of Gondor where Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are desparately trying to defend the people of Rohan who have taken refuge there.  The Ringwraiths are on the prowl.  Merry and Pippin are captives of the Uruk Hai.  Yet not all hope is lost.  The little hobbits, Frodo, the ring bearer, and Sam, a more faithful friend you could not find, press on towards Mordor with the help of Gollum, a pitiful creature consumed by his lust for the Ring's power.
As with ""The Fellowship"", ""Two Towers"" is alive with (get ready for a long list, here) a wonderfully faithful-to-the-book script, stunning landscapes, emotion, rousing action, a stirring score, excitement, suspense, fine acting, comradery, passion, humility, philosophy, intrigue, depth, symbolism, virtue, and stunning cinematography (whew, did I miss anything?).
Bottom line: 5 out of 5 stars.  I love this film and you will too!",1063756800,,1754,4.965753424657534

That they cannot share in the utter and absolute joy the rest of us feel at having witnessed the cinematic miracle that Peter Jackson and crew have accomplished with, literally, their blood, sweat and tears - for four long years. I wish they could be walking on the same clouds I'm walking on, for having lived long enough to experience this lifelong dream of seeing their most beloved book brought to the big screen with such style and verve!
By the way: really liked the movie! The first one, too!

Frodo Baggins starts to fall to the Ring itself, but a strong companion, Sam, helped him keep moderate control of himself.  Meanwhile, Aragon and his two companions search nonstop for the other two Hobbits that were imprisoned by Sauroman's army.  Soon, the war for Middle Earth will begin and time is running low for Frodo.  The honorable sequel ends with the first battle of the war--The Battle of Helmes Deep.

Anyways, I thought the movie was really good and has many things that movies out of Hollywood are lacking these days:  a compelling story, believable characters, good vs. evil and a good soundtrack.  The battle scenes in this movie were fantastic.  I thought the pace was pretty good, it seemed like an hour and half movie instead of the three it was pushing.  And I can't wait for the next one to come out.

I am a Tolkien Purist, and the additions to the storyline were a bit weird and non-sensical to me, but they didn't really take anything from the pureness level. However, some of the stuff that they took out of the movie really irked me - until I watched the preview for the extended edition.
The stuff with the forest swallowing the Uruk-hai is in the extended footage, as is the ent-draught scene, and even a scene i would guess would have to be quite lengthy - the scene after the destruction of the area around Orthanc and the flood and all of that stuff.
I have no doubt that the extended edition will complete the already wonderful movie.",1063670400,,723,4.402985074626866
1462158,5,B00005JKZU,"Who expected this film could match the first one?  The filmaking techniques are similar, but this movie has a different feel from the first, just as each of the stages in Tolkien's epic have an evolving sense of impending doom mixed with hints of hope.  As most readers know, some details of the book have been changed.  Even so, the film is very faithful to the book and even fleshes out some aspects of the story.  I like the widesreen version best and the extras are nice too.",1063670400,,479,4.409090909090909
1462159,4,B00005JKZU,"OK, so the whole Tolkien purist thing has been done, done, done. INTERPRETATION. ADAPTATION. ""Based on.""  You'll live, and if you've got to blame someone, you probably want to blame the money-chasing movie industry.
Got it? Good. Let's put this aside for the moment and look at the film, free of the baggage: in many parts it's a lot more engaging than the Fellowship (which seemed more about exposition than anything), but why is this so patchy? There's over 40 minutes of extra stuff on the upcoming extended edition, and its absence in the theatrical release makes itself known.  There's SO much stuff to cram in, and it's hard to absorb without either some more explanation, or by knowing the story beforehand.
It was nice to see that very little time was given to rehashing and the scope of the tale was widely expanded, but there are parts of the story that seemed extremely ill-paced and hard to follow: too much plot, not enough time (come to think, this is probably the reason for the much-maligned Arwen thing -- how else are you going to reveal it?).  The equally disputed part where the Elves joined the battle at Helm's Deep seemed to have absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than adding a juicy dramatic death scene to a familiar-but-not-central character.  The Ents were practically forgettable, with the exception of the excellent scene at Isengard -- it was as though the forest-wandering scenes were merely pillows in between bits of action, totally devoid of any other purpose.  The action rolls along nicely, but the end of the film kind of dangles, neither a cliffhanger nor a gentle 'See you next year!'
Meanwhile, some of the more interesting characters' development seemed somewhat lacking, again probably attributable to the missing pieces.  A lot more interesting things could have been done with the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli -- short jokes don't cut it, and both characters were otherwise flat.  Elrond's behaviour in the scene with Arwen is, like 'Fellowship,' just a bit more sinister than it really needs to be.  It would have been nice to make the most of Eowyn's character, with a little more time spent on her mettle and royalty, and less on the fawning over Aragorn/helping small kids aspect.
Put simply, it feels a bit 'unfinished,' and it's not just the middle-of-the-trilogy syndrome.  I'd be inclined to wait till the Return of the King is released before making any firm judgment, though.
The acting is schweeeet, avoiding the two-dimensionality that comes with Big Epics (and yes, Gollum counts as acting).  The cast does a fantastic job despite the lack of attention to their roles' development.  David Wenham in particular does a great job with adding some warmth to an otherwise shallow and unnecessarily nasty Faramir.  Viggo Mortensen continues to stand out, adding all kinds of depth to Aragorn and avoiding the all-too-common Big Epic stock hero routine you tend to get in films like this.  It's also particularly nice to see Elijah Wood doing something other than the 'happy hobbit/scared, bugeyed hobbit' routine.
The transfer to DVD is particularly good, with only a small amount of artifacting floating about in the edges of the darker scenes.  The surround audio is outstandingly sharp to my ears, and if you're interested in the English subtitles for the hearing impaired, you'll be pleased to note that it sticks like glue to the spoken dialogue.  The extra DVD's full of the usual interesting peeks into the filming and so forth, and some fun (but typically cable-fluffy) interviews with the cast, producers and Jackson.  Sean Astin's cute short film, The Long and the Short Of It, is entertaining -- but come on, do we need a Making Of for that one? Sheesh.  The game preview looks superb.  The Two Towers footage is simply amazing.
I didn't really want this version, preferring to get the extended edition for a more complete film, but my brother (bless him) gave it to me as a gift.  Wait for the extended release if you've become a big fan and really want to get a better idea of Jackson's interpretation, cause my gut says that the missing pieces in the theatre release are contained in those 40 minutes.

I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.
As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie. All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately. If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.
From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile. While there are plenty of thrilling fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deep character development, especially since all the characters have already been introduced in the first movie. There are plenty of special effects, such as Smeagle/Gollum and the epic battle scenes, but they are blended into the movie and advance the story; they don't create a sense of showing off like many over hyped movies seem to do.
[possible spoilers here]
Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual. Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one. He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy. The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film. And of course, there is Gollum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.
In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie. It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the ""Star Wars"" of this generation.

1462263,5,B00005JKZU,"Being a movie fan who has never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this movie or not. I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.
As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie. All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately. If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.
From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile. While there are plenty of thrilling fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deep character development, especially since all the characters have already been introduced in the first movie. There are plenty of special effects, such as Smeagle/Gollum and the epic battle scenes, but they are blended into the movie and advance the story; they don't create a sense of showing off like many over hyped movies seem to do.
[possible spoilers here]
Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual. Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one. He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy. The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film. And of course, there is Gollum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.
In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie. It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the ""Star Wars"" of this generation. Peter Jackson's second Lord of the Rings movie is an excellent show and a movie that will be famous years from now.",1063497600,4,2178,4.420398009950249
1462264,5,B00005JKZU,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is that rare breed of film that combines a dense plot, immaculate storytelling and awe-inspiring visuals.  Not since ""Star Wars"" perhaps has film captured the essence of all 3 elements as beautifully as this film does.
To be sure, the first instalment of LOTR - ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" - was a grand epic in and of itself.  But, ""Two Towers"" is not only a continuation of that initial glimpse into Middle Earth - it's much much more.  It rises above the first film if  only because the middle of any great piece of art often becomes a stepping stone towards the end.  A great book can sag in the middle, when an author starts tying together the pieces that result in the climax.  Like that, a great film series (think ""The Empire Strikes Back"") often uses the middle installment to move the story along - though not too much - so that filmgoers are primed and ready for part 3.  The middle installment is like the middle child - the ""Eve Plumb/Jan Brady"" of moviemaking - somewhat lost between the shuffle of its older
wiser sibling and the pitter patter of its adorable, always-preferred baby of the family.
What makes Towers so unique in this regard is that the film stands on its own two feet (like those awesome trees that avenge their own destruction) with mind-blowing effects that overwhelm your senses and literally take you to another world.  This is a movie worth repeat viewings - the dialogue is sometimes hard to follow, and of course, and many of characters and themes enjoy other-worldly terms and dialects that add to the challenge of keeping up.  But this is a film that is sure to please both diehard fans of the Tolkien story (of which I am not) AND the average moviegoer who is simply looking to be blown away by the wonder of special effects, some of which are simply awesome.
The story takes us forward towards the inevitable showdown between good and evil that's promised in the final film, yet it brings us closer than ever into the worlds of Hobbits and Orcs, of wizards and demons.  Gollum - a slimy character that literally comes to life despite its computerized DNA - is a stunner, and the scenes of war and mayhem, the battle of Rohan, and the return of Gandalf simply have to be seen to be experienced in their full majesty.  Any film like this is best seen first on a huge screen with a full capacity audience.  Yet, in the privacy of home, the DVD allows us to re-live those sensations while digging deeper into specific sequences that might have been obscured or glossed over in a movie theater.  We're awed by the majesty of New Zealand's grandeur, and brought to earth by the delicate friendship between Sam and Frodo, which in this film becomes truly human.
A wonderful, visually stunning movie that even mortals like me can enjoy over and over again.",1063497600,,2828,4.554240631163708
1462265,5,B00005JKZU,"I'll start with the things I didn't like about the movie, and get that out of the way, but keep in mind that I give this five stars and will still give it five stars after the following mini-rant.
Faramir -- WHAT is with this? This isn't Faramir! This is reincarnated Boromir at his worst! I understand that it adds to the drama of the movie, but it screws up characterization so bad it's ridiculous. And since RotK is both the climax of the trilogy and Faramir's biggest role, characterization should matter more just now, not adding unnessecary tension. He did go back to normal at the end, though, which is something, and he's supposed to be back in character for RotK. So while this didn't mess up the plot as badly as it might have, it's going to confuse people who haven't read the books.
Gimli -- Gimli is not comic relief. Gimli rocks. The lagging behind Aragorn and Legolas, the Wargs piling on top of him, were a little much. The ""Toss me"" lines were classic, though, and I liked ""If I had time I'd get this adjusted, it's a little tight across the chest,"" and ""Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?"" And I'm glad they kept his competition with Legolas to see who would kill more orcs, and that they kept some non-comical lines for him.  So, like the Faramir thing, it turned out okay, but it's also going to give people the wrong impression. Gimli has one or two amusing moments, but no more than anyone else.
Aragorn and the cliff -- Obviously, this was done to establish Eowyn's loving Aragorn and to reinforce Aragorn and Arwen, but it wasn't in the book. I approve of PJ's doing something with the romantic tension between Aragorn and Eowyn -- maybe it was just me, but when Faramir mentioned it in the RotK book, I thought, ""What? What'd I miss?"" -- but really, it could have been more subtle, and while it didn't interrupt the plot line too much, it was totally unnessecary and there was enough hinting already that didn't interrupt the plot AT ALL.
Got that out of my system.
Now, onto things I liked...it's hard to pick out specific things the way you can do with errors, so this will be ramble-tastic. Bear with me.
The emotion at the end between Frodo and Sam convinced me that RotK is going to be the tearjerker movie of the year. (The RotK preview in the special features is practically proof too.) Gollum was excellently done -- another example of special effects magic and of Andy Serkis's talent. The acting was terrific as usual. I thought Miranda Otto was amazing as Eowyn, and the actor who played Grima Wormtongue, I don't know his name, but Christ Almighty, THAT is talent.
I know the battle at Helm's Deep wasn't nearly that big or dramatic in the book, but honestly, I don't care. Call me a traitor to Tolkienites everywhere, but aside from the elves being there, there was nothing in it that didn't mesh with the books. Besides, give me an epic battle scene and I'm in love. If they had to cut out Shelob, then this was the big moment in TTT, and it was wonderfully done, not to mention an excellent set-up for RotK, when the war begins in earnest. (Can you tell I've got Return of the King on the brain? I can't help it, if PJ doesn't make too many mistakes, it'll be the best of the three and my new favorite movie. If he screws it up, heads will roll.)
All in all, an excellent movie, worth seeing and worth the three hours. I only wish it were longer.",1063411200,3,3419,4.384251968503937
1462266,5,B00005JKZU,"This review is for LOTR - The Two Towers theatrical release DVD.
The long awaited release of the theatrical version DVD is finally available and it is an absolutely incredible film and DVD.  From the moment that it was announced that Peter Jackson would be filming ""The Lord of the Rings,"" many Tolkien fans, casual or diehard expressed both joy and anxiety over the filming of this literary classic.  They expressed joy over finally being able to see this extraordinary story in film and anxiety over whether director Peter Jackson would be able to be true to the original story and do justice to it.
Despite the theatrical releases of both the first and second films being three hours each, Peter Jackson still couldn't fit everything in, but that's what the Extended versions are for and if the Extended version being released in November is anywhere near as good as the first one, it should be an exceptional experience that brings the film closer to being true to Tolkien's original work.  As to Peter Jackson being able to do justice to Tolkien's literary masterpiece; he not only does justice to it, the first two films have been nothing less than extraordinary!
Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davis, Bernard Hill, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Brad Dourif and Karl Urban all deserve high praise for bringing their great performances to this classical story that will certainly go down in the history books as the finest set of films ever to be produced.  Even higher praise goes to Andy Serkis, who brought Gollum to life, despite never actually being seen in the film, without his efforts, the reality of Gollum would never have made it to the film.
High praise should go to Director Peter Jackson for his use of special effects in the manner in which he has in this and the first film.  The special effects are quite obviously there, but they're not what drive the film, but an asset to it.  Many directors could've easily used special effects to drown out the most important part of this film, the characters, their individual stories and how they interact with one another.
The premise:
As ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" closed; Boromir has been killed in battle with the Uruk-hai , Frodo and Sam have lead off on their own to reach Mordor and Merry and Pippin have been captured by the Uruk-hai.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have vowed to catch up with the Uruk-hai to free Merry and Pippin...
As ""The Two Towers"" opens up, we see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in pursuit of the Uruk-hai in hopes of freeing Merry and Pippin and we see Frodo and Sam, on their quest to find Mordor, though they're having problems finding their way through the mountains.  They soon discover that they're being followed and capture their pursuer, Gollum, who once possessed the ring for a very long time, and is now an ancient creature, who at one time had been Hobbit like, but he's been ""distorted"" by his possession of the ring, or more specifically, the rings possession of him.  We're soon brought to the return of Gandalf, who is now Gandalf the White after his epic battle with the Balrog which is a cinematically beautiful battle between a wizard and demon.
What follows from there is nothing short of one the most entertaining films ever created.  The Battle of Helm's Deep alone is so epic in proportion that it somewhat lessens the experience of other films where there were ""epic"" battles.  {ssintrepid}

1462267,5,B00005JKZU,"Well, I would just like to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Sure, some extra scenes were added, but this doesn't destroy the movie. Sure, some things were left out, or changed, but so what?? Peter Jackson and the cast and crew of LOTR did a fabulous job. Everything was filmed perfectly and was completely flawless. I especially love the scenery (considering it was filmed in beautiful New Zealand), and Gollum in particular was just as I imagined he would be when reading the book. Another impressive point to consider is the wonderful music. I think Howard Shore did such a good job on this.
So, let me round this off by saying, that if you are a true fan of LOTR, you won't let a few minor changes destroy the movie when it has so much else going for it. This is just my personal opinion, though. I can understand (kind of) that some people don't like the movie because it's just not the sort of thing they like or because it's too long, but being a so-called ""Tolkien Purist"" is just stupid. I personally have read the books myself several times, and Tolkien is an absolute genius. Peter Jackson and company are only really there to make tribute to his amazing imagination and ability as a writer.",1063324800,,1251,4.491228070175438
1462268,5,B00005JKZU,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that really sticks with you. It goes beyond trying to dazzle you exclusively with special effects or grandiose story lines. Don't get me wrong, Two Towers certainly has these two down. But it doesn't stop there.
The visuals are stunning. Ice capped mountains, lush forests, and ornate castles are so detailed, so crisp, that you may forget this is just a movie.
The characters are developed with much effort and love. From Frodo, to Aragorn, to the evil Sarumon, you know their motivations,passion and conviction to have their victory. And you will find yourself rooting for some and against others.
The battle for Helms Deep is intense. As the rain pours down thousands of individual can be seen locked in combat. And it looks absolutely great! Some of the best mass battle scenes in film.
Watch this trilogy. I hope it stirs your heart as it did mine.",1063324800,,895,4.707006369426751
1462470,4,B00005JKZU,"As an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings books, I must say that I was overall impressed with the Two Towers movie.  I had been warned ahead of time that it was the movie that Peter Jackson had changed the most out of all three films, so I went into it expecting some changes.  Little changes didn't bother me (like the whole thing with Pippin taking the brooch off with his mouth, as mentioned in an earlier review).  I did enjoy the beefing up of the female characters, and the fact that Jackson showed what was happening with Arwen, because I often found myself wondering about that while reading the book.  And while some of the larger changes were a little different(what's up with the whole Aragorn falling off the cliff thing?), making me wonder if I was watching the right movie, I think the changes I was most disappointed in were the changes that made the characters look bad.  For example, the fact that Faramir took them all the way to Osgiliath before he finally decided to let Frodo go.  One of the things that really impressed me in the book was how Faramir resisted the temptation of the ring almost right away, in stark contrast to his brother Boromir.  It just made him seem a little flakier.  Also, the fact that the Ents didn't decide to get involved in the war until Pippin's quick thinking.  This made Pippin look good, but made the Ents worse characters.  I understand why Peter Jackson made these changes, because both made for a more dramatic movie, and I realize he has to think of the people who haven't read the books and keep them interested as well.  It just was kind of disappointing to see those characters portrayed in that way. The only other thing that I had to chuckle over was the battle of Helm's Deep.  It is a battle that takes up one chapter in the book, and it took up at least 45 minutes of the movie.  It was excellently done...just plan on being in the theater for five hours for The Return of the King!  With all that still needs to happen from The Two Towers that was left out, we'll be there a while!
I think it's easy to find fault with any movie converted from a book, because a book can include more detail.  And let's face it:  if you've grown up reading a story, and have loved it for many years, it's always a little disappointing to have it change in a movie.  I think, though, that we need to imagine what an overwhelming task it must be to convert a well-known book trilogy to three movies.  There is no way that everyone will be happy.  Also, I think that Peter Jackson has done a great job at paying attention to detail that many other directors may have overlooked.  Overall, I think he did a great job.  I enjoyed the Two Towers, and I'm looking forward to seeing the extra footage in the extended edition!",1063324800,,2765,4.361328125
1462471,5,B00005JKZU,"There isn't very much at all to be said about this film that hasn't already been said ad nausem. It totally manages to outdo the first film in the series in every way possible, especially in entertainment value. The characters are well developed and always interesting, and the massive battle scenes (especially the Battle of Helms Deep) are undoubtedly the best ever filmed for  medeviel epic, and that includes Braveheart. Anyone that even vaguely enjoys any kind of fantasy/action and has two and a half hours to kill should pick this up as soon as possible. An essiential piece to any DVD collection!",1063324800,2,604,4.864077669902913
1462472,5,B00005JKZU,"It's been about 23 years since I've read the books.  I do think they were the greatest books I've ever read.  Of course, I don't remember all of the details which is probably why I totally enjoyed this film so much.  I certainly can't fault the ""Purists"" for being upset about some of the changes.  The whole ""Faramir"" thing is something I vaguely remembered when viewing the film and it did bug me a little.  I know they were going for a darker feal to this film but let heroes be heroes.  That said, I still loved the film as is.  So, it's not sticking to the book.  I'm just glad they (Hollywood)actually made a worthy depiction of the concept in general!  After sitting through the Ralf Bakshi(?) debacle this was an awesome relief.

As a film, no matter my fealings about ""accuracy"", I just could not give it less than 5 stars.  I love fantasy movies and this series is undeniably the benchmark.  I kind of feal sorry for the ""purests"" for their inability to separate this film from the books.  Maybe take a break from the film, clear your mind and view the film later...  as a separate entity.  You can't deny this is a spectacular and well made film.  It's OK to be disapointed about story and character ""tweaking"", just don't deny yourself the joy of a film that will get you as close as your ever going to get to seeing The LOTR trilogy with your own 2 eyes.  Some disappointment?  Of course!  However, you'll be doing yourself a favor if you can get over it and get into this story.  Then you can have a favorite book trilogy AND a favorite film trilogy.  I will bet anything that this will not be re-made ever again. This is it....  ... or you could act it out in your mom's basement!!!

Oh yea, the DVD is great yadda yadda..",1063238400,,1737,4.326086956521739
1462473,5,B00005JKZU,"I was crazy not to watch The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in the theaters because if that film looked THAT amaZinG on my own big screen tv at home (which it did) then Oh MY...i could only imagine how spectacular, how intensifying it would look on the giant silver screen.
This sequel engaged me from beginning to end.  I learned to love several characters while hating others.  Never has the battle of good versus evil looked so awing.  You know how after you keep seeing the good guys win again and again in so many films that you kinda get sick of it and wish the bad guys would conquer for once?? well...I can almost guarantee you will be rootin' on tHeSe good men til the very end.  I mean, their sheer passion to protect what is good, upright and noble is so compelling that you can almost taste the blood spilt on their behalf.  You are so much drawn into every scene that you almost forget your own surroundings.
Unlike the first movie The Fellowship of the Ring, this second film focuses more on each individual character for the nine original members of the fellowship have split up into three different subgroups (as you see at the end of the first movie).  This allows for a larger scope of action that will bind you to your seat.  And is it just me or do those Oks keep getting uglier and uglier?? *shudders* haha  Clearly, this film isn't big on romance, but if you're curious to see if it follows the blossoming love between Aragorn and Arwen the daughter of the master elf...they do have some brief but substantial scenes together.
I have several favorite scenes in this film--all of which are parts in the battle of Helm's Deep (or is it Keep?).  I won't say exactly what they are so as not to spoil it for those of you who have not yet seen Two Towers.  It is all very exciting tho and sincerely impressive I must say.  This has to be my favorite movie of the year and that says alot because I usually favor romantic comedies.  Two Towers is filled with  action, adventure, lust, and emotion.  They call the great battle: the War of the Ring.  I call it the war of good vs. evil.  They did an awesome job of creating the special effects...and the animated characters possess so much realism that you may think they are people dressed in costume and an extreme amount of makeup.
I must add, if you are a huge fan of the handsome Legolas (Orlando Bloom)--like I am (of course ;) hehe)--you will be happy to find that he has more parts in this one than first.  And he shows off his fighting skills in addition to his expert archery talent.  Hmmm...and I have to say...i love it when he speaks Elf...it's smooth...rich and sexy! haha
Basically, if you loved the first one, you will be enchanted by its sequel (Two Towers) and I am more than anxious to see the final addition to the trilogy (The Return of the King) for I'm sure it will not dissapoint. =)  As long as they keep making 'em, I'm gonna keep seeing 'em. ;)",1063238400,,2936,4.354128440366972

Please don't make judgemens like ""you can't expect everything down to the minute detail to be the same"" if you donlt know that they changed everything.

The making of the video game was great also. What I liked the most was the return of the king  preview I can't wait to see that movie. I am also waiting for the special edition of the two towers i am sure that that dvd will be great.,1063152000,,409,4.049382716049383
1462476,3,B00005JKZU,"First let me say that those involved in bringing these books to the screen have a monumental task, and are doing a fairly good job in representation.
I know poetic license is often taken in such aspects, and as for missing some of the story, that just happens.  How in the world do you put a full novel on the screen.  That being said, there is one aspect to TTT that really got my goat.
WHY CHANGE THE COMPLETE PORTRAYAL OF AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER!  I of course refer to the screen version of Faramir.  In the book, you are given a glimpse of what the Fellowship of the ring would have been if the ""right"" son had been set to the task, rather than the ""rightful"" son.  Faramir of the book was pure in spirit, where Boromir was flawed.  There was no quest for glory, no kidnapping, no sudden epiphany.  Faramir knew, as soon as he realized who Frodo was, what needed to be done.  Purest? You have to draw the line somewhere.
Other things also bothered me a bit in the sense that there is so much material from the books to use, why create new scenes.",1063152000,10,1049,4.262626262626263
1462477,2,B00005JKZU,"After reading the first hundred reviews on this site, I must admit I am still hunting for those rabid purists I have heard so much about...
The negative reviews which I have read, have for the most part admitted and appreciated the difficulty of translating Tolkien's masterpiece to the screen while disagreeing with the changes Peter Jackson chose to incorporate into TTT.
Am I missing something here?  Since when does wishing a movie would be *more* true to its namesake make one a fanatic who should shut up, get a life, and not bother those who know how to ""truly enjoy"" a good movie?
What makes a compendium of reviews valuable is the rich difference of opinions.  Certainly, for those who loved the movie, say so!  Tell us about what you enjoyed.  But give those who differ from you the same privilege and allow them their ""negative"" opinion.
That being said, I join the ranks of those who were very disappointed in TTT.  I enjoyed FOTR and own the extended edition, which, while it differs from the book at points, is true to the spirit of the book.  3 cheers for Peter Jackson!  If he had not done so well with movie #1, I wouldn't have been at the theater with such high expectations for movie #2.
I would have enjoyed TTT as a stand-alone movie titled differently.  However, I went to the theater to see Tolkien's work, not some other hybrid plot that happened to bear the same name--with enough points in common to show that it was, indeed, trying to recreate the same story, but so many MAJOR things completely different...
So let me be disappointed.  No, my world isn't ending, nor will I be picketing in front of the theater come December.  That doesn't mean you can't like the movie.
And if that makes me a ""rabid purist""--well, then so be it.",1063065600,14,1758,4.552380952380952
1462618,2,B00005JKZU,"I'm actually rather loth to give this two stars, since it was such a rotten movie.  This should not have been called the Two Towers; call it something else, because it did not accurately portray the book at all.  Tolkien would be rolling in his grave.  Since when did Faramir become worse than Boromir?  Why would a Wringwraith be scared away from taking the One Ring (that is being handed to him) by a measily little arrow?  Why is Frodo seen as being very weak?  Why do the Ents decide not to attack Isengard?  Why does Aragorn needlessly fall over the cliff?  In referance to that, why is he still alive when he does?  Why does Arwen show up so much when she's hardly seen in the books?  Why is Eown not stunningly beautiful like Tolkien says in the book?  Why is every orc enormous?  Even the Urak-hi were not supposed to be man high.  And why in the name of all that is good and beautiful, why does the movie skip the last half of the book entirely?
  People may say that it's a good movie if you don't think of it as being 'The Two Towers.'  I beg to differ.  It has no plot and the acting clashes with itself.  What a waste in millions of dollars.  Even more sad is the delusion of millions of people that they think that they know all about the Lord of the Rings.",1063065600,9,1271,4.177685950413223

This has to be my favorite movie of the year and that says alot because I usually favor romantic comedies.  Two Towers is filled with  action, adventure, lust, and emotion.  They call the great battle: the War of the Ring.  I call it the war of good vs. evil.  They did an awesome job of creating the special effects...and the animated characters possess so much realism that you may think they are people dressed in costume and an extreme amount of makeup.
I must add, if you are a huge fan of the handsome Legolas (Orlando Bloom)--like I am (of course ;) hehe)--you will be happy to find that he has more parts in this one than first.  And he shows off his fighting skills in addition to his expert archery talent.  Hmmm...and I have to say...i love it when he speaks Elf...it's smooth...rich and sexy! haha
Basically, if you loved the first one, you will be enchanted by its sequel (Two Towers) and I am more than anxious to see the final addition to the trilogy (The Return of the King) for I'm sure it will not dissapoint. =)  As long as they keep making 'em, I'm gonna keep seeing 'em. ;)",1062979200,,2920,4.364140480591497
1462620,5,B00005JKZU,"A most enjoyable adaptation of Tolkien's books. I liked the first film after I initially viewed it at the theater, but after watching it again on DVD I grew to love this film. The Two Towers made me feel the same after viewing it at the theater. I thought it was good, and was just slightly annoyed at a change or two from the original book. I'm not a purist, and after seeing it on DVD for the second time I believe I will come to love this film too. Jackson does such a wonderful job telling this mid-part of the story that I can forgive his deviation from the letter of the book (except maybe Aragorn fall). I still feel that the extended version of this film will be, like the first, a better film. If it is, it will pace itself much better, and flesh out the story to enhance the viewer's movie experience.
I gave the extended edition of Fellowship to a non Tolkien fan friend, and he said he felt a bit cheated that the theater version wasn't as good as what was on the version I had given him.
If you enjoy watching a great film again and again, you'll not be disappointed in this film.",1062979200,,1093,4.184834123222749
1462621,4,B00005JKZU,"I've read several of the reviews, and the one thing noone has mentioned is the way Sam and Frodo's relationship is portrayed.  In the book (and I know now you are calling me a purist), Frodo and Sam love each other dearly.  Sam is like a father or big brother to Frodo.  This is an intense love and desire to protect that I think the movie misses entirely.  Frodo is at times portrayed as downright mean to Sam, I admit at times he was firm in the book when he rebuked Sam for his treatment of Gollum but in the movie you don't see that ""everything I am doing I am doing exclusively for you"" attitude that is so obvious in the original writing.  Sam was by Frodo's side, not because Galdalf said so, but because he was worried about his friend.  While I agree with the ""purist"" reviews and wish that so much of the storyline had not been changed to ""more interesting"" fighting scenes, I will happily view this film again and again and be happy with what Tolkien I can get.  I still appreciated Fellowship much more due to the close adherence to the original storyline.  I have to thank Peter Jackson for bringing to the screen the personification of what I had for so many years been viewing in my imagination and doing  it so well that I could honestly say it could have been my imagination I was seeing (this is especially true of Aragorn, ooohh baby!) I went to the midnight showings of Fellowship (which I left with a tear in my eye) and Two Towers (which I left wondering if maybe I should have just gotten a good night's sleep) and I will be present for the midnight of Return of the King, but this time I will be much more guarded in my expectations.",1062892800,,1657,4.285256410256411
1462622,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is better than the majority, if not all movies made since the making of Star Wars Return of the Jedi (1983)  everything(fantasy/sci-fi wise) since has been frilly cheap hollywood B. S. & corny dialogue.  Lord of the Rings(both movies) are magical and beautiful and well written and acted.  For you who are knocking the ""Purists"" I wouldn't waste my time on those geeks. Thier opinion means nothing.  Dungeons and Dragon nerds are not the ones to rate a movie!
I don't let some geek tell me how to make it, watch it, or play it!
Two Towers is much better than the first(although the first was very good)  and tells the deeper elements of the story, whereas the first mainly introduced the characters.  Gollumn's internal conflict was the best part of all, good is not always good, Gollumn isn't totally evil.  The Battle was excellent as well with Aragorn at the front and countless warriors and clever fighting moves. The only mar was that elves live longer than humans and Aragorn would be elderly but Aowen would go on eternal. How can you love someone that doesn't age when you do? I do not own the DVD, but I have seen the movie and can rate it somewhat accurately(it IS the movie that counts, not the extras).  Go see it in the theater again but as for the DVD's wait for the final release of the LoR trilogy and collect all of the DVDS at once!",1062892800,,1361,4.459677419354839
1462623,4,B00005JKZU,"I read the trilogy when I was a teenager (a long time ago) and absolutely HATED the first movie.  waited for DVD, and with low expectations rented ""Two Towers.""  I was agreeably surprised.  The characters have a little more character, the battle scenes are at least VISIBLE (unlike ""Fellowship"" where half the time battles were black screen with grey shadows, impossible to know what was going on).  They did a pretty good job of creating something that looked large scale.
That said, there were two things that still really set my teeth on edge: (1) the color affectation.  Don't understand why moviemakers think it is cool to do really weird things to the color.  I realize that the theme of the movie is ""dark"", but the color is so bleached that they may as well have filmed it in black and white.  And the other elements of the film should create enough atmosphere that we should not need the perpetual twilight to understand that the world is ""dark."" WE GET IT, OK?? Over  the time covered by the movie, the sun should have come out once or twice.  Even the ""lightest"" scenes, in Rohan, looked like northern scotland on a rainy day.
(2) CHOIR OF ANGELS: how impossibly hokey, all that ""AH - Ah!"" ing by what sounds like a choir of angels lost from ""The Ten Commandments"".  It is so annoying I felt like turning the movie off every time. Stick with the pseudo - Celtic motif, or other less intrusive ""this is a holy moment"" music; these angels are really awful.",1062892800,,1465,4.5361216730038025
1462624,1,B00005JKZU,"After Fellowship of the Ring, I expected much more from The Two Towers than I received!  It was such a digression from the reality of the book that it could be considered an entirely different novel  that was filmed.

1462625,5,B00005JKZU,"Ok, first of all, what's not to love about a movie that stars hotties like Orlando Bloom and Elija Wood. The movie is awesome especially if u have 5.1 surround sound! The first scene is so cool. I found it a lot more entertaining than the last one.",1062892800,2,248,4.1875
1462626,5,B00005JKZU,"Forget quibbles about minute details, this is an outstanding achievement and DOES follow the books in all ways necessary.  I could not believe how well this has been put together.  The casting is fantastic, the story runs well, even jumping between the various actors so we know what is going on all over Middle Earth.  It is wonderful.  To address a few of the details, if jackson had not added a little point here or there, the 3rd movie would be a bit short as the 3rd book is half appendix.  It also the changes also explain things that are more difficult to put into a visual format.  They work well.  I, for one, am delighted with the whole thing and this is a monumental achievement.  Congrats to Jackson and cast on a job well done!",1062806400,,740,4.389705882352941
1462784,5,B00005JKZU,"I think this movie well exceeds its predecessor in all aspects.  Peter Jackson does a great job of running 4 to 5 storylines concurrently, and without allowing the audience to tire of the story.  Just as it starts to get a little boring, Jackson gives us a breathtaking piece of scenery or a dynamic battle/action sequence.  I must say that I feel one actor is glossed-over somewhat in the movie and in the extras on the DVD.  Sure, McKellan (Gandalf)...Bloom (Legolas)...Mortensen (Aragorn).... and others do a wonderful acting job, but none can surpass Christopher Lee (Saruman).  My favorite scene in this whole movie is Saruman's ""To War!"" speech.  This is the highlight of the film....the rest of the story moves downhill from there.  Lee just does such an awesome 30-second speech...I want to just jump right in and build an army for Mordor myself!  He is so convincing as the evil wizard.  It bothers me that Lee's acting is not more recognized.  I was quite disappointed that he was not interviewed very much for the DVD extras.  I sure hope this will be remedied in the Extended Edition (also additional scenes with Saruman would be nice!).
Overall, the DVD is well packaged and the on-screen menus are very easy to navigate.  I was very happy to learn (upon opening) that the DVD designers had made each disc with a photo of each of the Two Towers.  Also, the Ringwraith riding into the screen every time something is selected on the extras disc is a nice touch.  Good work, New Line!!  I am sure looking forward to the Extended Edition in November...and the Return of the King in December!",1062806400,,1600,4.705035971223022
1462785,5,B00005JKZU,"I think it's really hard to find a movie where the sequel exceeds the first.  However, THE TWO TOWERS definitely does this, probably because you move more out of the introduction phase and more into the storyline.  For that reason, if you have never seen the first movie and are trying to watch this one first, you are going to be lost.  The story picks up, expecting you to know what's going on and who everyone is.  This movie includes the same characters as the original; however, there is less focus on Frodo and the other hobbits, and more on Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.
Basically, this movie continues Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring.  Gollum soon arises, and despite Sam's detesting, Frodo trusts Gollum to lead them to Mordor, since they cannot find the way on their own.  There is a HUGE emphasis on Gollum as a result of this, which is great because he becomes more than just a figure that wants the ring.  On the other side, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for the other two hobbits and later try to save the race of Men, whom Saruman desires to destroy.
There's more action in this sequel, in my opinion.  There's also a person who is possessed/controlled, more of a love story (which I didn't like), and so much more humor.  There are several moments in the movie where someone cracks a joke or something funny happens (mostly about and to the poor dwarf), which I felt added to the movie a bunch.  There are also new creatures in this one.  The ending isn't [bad] either (it isn't a big cliffhanger or anything).  The movie continues to follow the book pretty well, and the additional features, such as ""bringing Gollum to life"" and ""creatures of Middle-earth"" are interesting.  There's also a 10 minute preview of THE RETURN OF THE KING.  This movie is one of my top 5 favorites (as is THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  A must see!",1062806400,,1848,4.540785498489426
1462786,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson is a truly amazing person; a mentor to any amateur filmmaker (in my opinion). Tolkien's epic classic is preserved and enhanced so much onscreen that one begins to wonder if any text has ever been adapted to the screen so successfully. And if the one happens to be me, I do more than wonder; I know.
  The performances are marvelous. Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins is stunning, haunting, and conflicted, as he is put in situation after situation in which he must rely on his willpower, which is fast dwindling as he succumbs more and more to the corruption of the One Ring.  And Sean Astin, as his faithful companion Samwise, is equally impressive while he has to bear the negative effects of Frodo's increasingly bad temper caused by the Ring.  Andy Serkis, as the CGI Gollum, is also excellent, an extremely sad character who tries to remain good but is also slave to the Ring; above all else he wants his Precious back.
  Supporting characters are also fabulous, Liv Tyler as Arwen nearly brought tears to my eyes as she made one of the most painful decisions of her life, the one lonely tear trickling down her face was beautiful and haunting. Ian McKellen is great as always, as Gandalf the white, Viggo Mortensen is slightly cliched but fantastic as Aragorn, and there are countless others too numerous to mention.
  The scope is amazing, as parts of New Zealand totally transform into Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Every camera angle is beautiful, the Howard Shore score is awesome.  Nothing is overlooked, and there is no doubting the genius of Peter Jackson and the rest of his crew.",1062806400,,1598,4.715827338129497
1462787,5,B00005JKZU,"While any other series would more than likely lack any real substance or storyline in it's middle section (there being no beginning or end) this second installment of the ""LOTR"" trilogy actually manages to advance the story and one-up part 1. The true souls of this movie are Frodo and Aragorn who continue to deepen as characters and show streaks of heroism that seem to surprise everyone around them, including themselves. My favorite sequence so far has to be the late night conversation Gollum has with his evil and good sides, his movements, facial expressions and creepy voice are an astounding feat of computer animation, you truly feel like Gollum is a real person. For a 3 hour film, ""...The Two Towers"" moves at a very brisk pace and never bores, even during the more sudued scenes. This is a terrific continuation and that leaves me eager to see just how good ""Return Of The King"" will be.",1062720000,5,900,4.7025316455696204
1462788,5,B00005JKZU,"First I would like to say that this was an excellent movie.  Yes, there are differences from the book.  As someone who loved the books, I was originally put off by the differences in the movie, but after watching the DVD a few times, I realized that my objection wasn't to the differences in how the movie flowed, but in how the producers seemed to view the audience.  Both Faramir and Treebeard initially make decisions inconsistent with the book till a few scenes later where they switch their decisions back.  I assume this was done for impact to the audience as Treebeard (being a shepherd of the forest) would have been aware of the destruction to the trees beforehand (as he did in the book) and Faramir - had he truly been under the influence of the ring and been in its presence long enough to travel to Osgiliath, would certainly have not released Frodo.  Both of these seemed to be changed for the visual impact to the audience though it somewhat falls short in Faramir's case IMO.  Adding the Elves to Helms Deep also seemed unnecessary as the same result could have been obtained by adding (as was in the book) more Riders.  Last and probably worst for me was the twisting of the Elrond/Arwen role to that of a 14 year old girl vs. her father (presumably for the 14 year old girls in the audience).  No aspect of that was in the books as both Elrond and Arwen knew their duties to themselves and others.  In todays time of self-indulgence, however, maybe this would have been completely lost on the audience.
People have said that it would have been a 15 hour movie to be true to the book, but these scenes actually added to the length unnecessarily IMO.  I do not believe that attendence or sales of the film would have been hurt had those scenes been done more true to the book, but I am not a producer.
All of that having been said, these things make up just a small portion of the movie.  So much of the movie IS true to the spirit and letter of the book that it is more than worth the 5 stars I gave it.  I am looking forward to seeing the extended scenes from the Two Towers as well as the Return of the King later this year.",1062720000,,2143,4.316708229426434

1462791,4,B00005JKZU,"After seeing the FOTR, which was nearly flawless in my opinion, I eagerly looked forward to 'The Two Towers'.  After all, since the entire trilogy was filmed all at once, how could TTT go wrong when FOTR was so right?  But unfortunately, it seems that Peter Jackson's team radically deviated from the book with mixed results.
Many Tolkien purists decry the change in Faramir's character, but Frodo and Sam's encounter with Faramir as written in the book probably would not have translated as well onto film.  The episode in Tolkien's book is rather talky, with Faramir interrogating the hobbits like a courtroom attorney in a trial. Having Faramir carrying off the hobbits and Gollum to Osgiliath adds more tension and conflict to the story and works better on film. Besides, when the Nazgul sees Frodo in Osgiliath with the ring, it naturally leads Sauron to believe that the ring is being taken to Minas Tirith, thus encouraging his attack on the city.
Another alteration to the story that Tolkien purists hate is having Haldir and a contingent of elves fight at Helm's Deep.  Personally, I thought the idea was rather novel, but as other critics have pointed out, how could the elves have traversed the distance from Lorien to Helm's Deep ahead of the Uruk-hai when Isengard is much closer to Rohan?  Hopefully, Peter Jackson will address this in his commentary on the forthcoming TTT:Extended Edition dvd.  With regard to the Ents, it does seem illogical on the face of it for Treebeard to suddenly want to attack Saruman after seeing the damage his orcs have wreaked on Fangorn forest when Treebeard was already aware that this was happening. But as with the changes to Faramir, having the Ents quietly deliberate among themselves and deciding to go to war would not have the same dramatic impact on the screen.
The changes from the book that do bother me is the exorcism performed on Theoden by Gandalf, as well as Theoden's behavior afterwards.  For all of its flaws, the animated version of LOTR was truer to the book with regard to the Rohan portion of the story, and it worked much better, whereas this part of the film in TTT was somewhat muddled.  For this reason, I give TTT 4 stars instead of the five I gave for FOTR.
The digital creation of Gollum works very well in TTT, in spite of the fact that Gollum does not look 100% real, Andy Serkis does a great job in creating a character that you can't help but feel for. On the other hand, the Nazgul in TTT do not seem all that scary.  We see Faramir's soldiers cringe from them in fear, but they do not do anything apart from flying around on their winged dragons and screeching.  In the books, the terror they instill is palpably felt by those around them, which is hard to convey on film.  Hopefully we will get to see them in action in ROTK.
Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn is slowly beginning to accept his destiny as the heir of Isildur, with him taking a commanding role in the Helm's Deep battle.  The friendship between Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf grows stronger, and while Gimli becomes something of a comic relief in TTT, John Rhys-Davies still makes him a likeable character.  In TTT, we also see the ring beginning to take its toll on Frodo, and his identification with Gollum's plight puts him at odds with his faithful friend Sam.
TTT is a visually stunning film, and the Helm's Deep battle, while perhaps a little too long, is truly awesome.  The New Zealand landscape works to great effect in the movie, with the snowcapped peaks a sight to behold.  Howard Shore also has created another excellent score, as he did in FOTR, and I play the TTT soundtrack on my CD player constantly.
But I am holding out for the extended dvd in November.  There will be flashback scenes with Faramir, Boromir and Denethor that will help put Faramir's actions with Frodo into context, plus I am sure a lot of people want to hear Peter Jackson's commentary explaining why he made the changes that infuriated so many Tolkien fans.  But if you are happy with the theatrical version of the film and don't want to sit through hours snd hours of documentary about how everything in the film was created and how the cast became such great buddies, then this two disc set is for you.",1062633600,,4238,4.621837549933422

I've read the trilogy twice a day ever since the day I was born (I'm listening to the book-on-tape version as I write this), and if I say the movie's a failure, then it's a no-good stinking failure! Where was Tom Bombadil in the first movie? Where, I ask you? He was essential to the story, what with the happy jumping and singing! The Barrow-wights? NOT THERE EITHER! I soiled myself with rage and urine when the Two Towers ended with no Shelob scene! I wish Peter Jackson was here right now so I could relieve myself on his shoes. I think that if a successful movie version is to be made, it should follow the book EXACTLY, with every boring bit of dialogue from every minor character spewing out their boring family history for pages and pages and pages. It should be at least 150 hours long with no breaks, and be shown only on airline planes that have been painted bright green, if they want to try to capture a mere sliver of what Tolkien was trying to convey through his works.",1062633600,3,1150,4.328703703703703

1462974,4,B00005JKZU,"I assume you have read the books or at a minimum seen the first video. J.R.R. Tolkien's second book of the LOTR series, ""The Two Towers"" would never fit in a three hour movie. Having said, that I love this DVD!
  The sweeping vistas of New Zealand are magnificent. The cinematography is breathtaking. The special effects are solid and unobtrusive. In fact they are so seamless that you find yourself completely taken in. One of my favorites special effects is that of Legolas (the elf) moounting a galloping horse. The computer generated battle scenes are completely believable and realistic!
  The score for this video is a bit below the quality of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" but didn't detract from the overall presentation. The music seems further in the background, perhaps ""muted"".
  Detail, costumes and sets are great. I was specially delighted by the director's presentation of the ""magical"" characters. The characters in general ae superbly acted, the performances flawless. I really liked the touch of ""elvish"" in the love scenes between Aragorn and Arween, it adds an ephimeral quality.
  The only reason I didn't give this DVD a five star rating is that it is not as engaging as it could be. I'm really hoping the extended version will live up to the extended version of the ""Fellowship"" and smooth out some of the story line gaps.
A great DVD. You will wonder where the three hours went!",1062633600,3,1398,4.84453781512605

1462976,4,B00005JKZU,"Let's get a  few things straight here.  First, the book that upon which this movie is based is a wonderful book, one of the best ever written, no doubt, and it has delighted millions of readers over the years.  Second, it is an extremely difficult book to turn into a movie.  Third, the movie will not follow the book exactly, which is too bad, but in some respects understandable.
  However, while I enjoyed the movie and I understand that changes had to be made, I did not enjoy these particular changes themselves.  It seemed to me that the producers and directors of this film sold out the Tolkien ideal in order to dumb the movie down to the lowest common demoninator of movie goers.  This is what irked me the most.  I realize that it is impossible to include all the nuances of each character into a movie, although they did a great job with Gollum.  However, I have never liked the way they have turned Merry and Pippin into semi-coherent idiots and phasing out Eomer and over emphasising Aragorn really hurt the flow of the movie.  Let's face it, the whole Aragorn falling off the cliff scene and dreaming about Arwen was really boring and seemed totally out of place with the rest of the film.  The only reason it was in there was to ""attract"" female viewers.  In other words, it is just another example of putting a Hollywood Formula into the movie where it was neither needed nor wanted.  The overextended battle of Helm's Deep and the confusing and totally unnecessary portrayal of Faramir seriously dampened the effect of the movie as a whole and are just further examples of the Director inserting the Hollywood Formula to cater to the perceived needs of a dumb audience.
  To summarize, while I understand the complexities of turning such a fantastic and intricate book into a movie, the changes that were made were unnecessary and detracted from the enjoyment of the movie as a whole. Overall, the movie is quite good.  As a comparison to the book, you'll be disappointed because it's obvious that those who are making these movies care only about tried and true Hollywood formulas and will use them at the expense of the far better written word.",1062633600,,2163,4.635170603674541

We see much, but in several small parts--the DVD lists more than 50 scenes--not all of which cohere or have sufficient time to explore the developments of the characters or the depths of Tolkien's theme; the writers and director seem to have tried to compensate by inserting several brief melodramatic bits of dialogue that are so anomalous that they come out almost farcically. Perhaps the film is best symbolized by Sean Astin; not only have his acting and pseudo-British accent degraded since the first film, but he is given several calculatingly sappy lines that, at the conclusion of a long and difficult-to-appreciate story, are downright outrageous. While Elijah Wood shines for his increasingly confident and even mature acting, he cannot make up for poor writing, directing, and editing. This is literary adaptation at its very worst. But what is perhaps even more disturbing than the adaptation are the reviews here at amazon.com; why is ignorance about books and authors--and anti-Tolkienism in particular--being touted by customers at a website that earned its fame by selling books? Have we become so foolish? I recommend [...] for reviews that tend to be written by people who remember that the author of The Two Towers was Tolkien, not Jackson. I look forward to the ""Return"" hesitantly, with little faith; I hope that the final film reawakens the enjoyment that I experienced when viewing ""Fellowship.""",1062547200,14,1644,5.278625954198473

I also see that you don't realise how many people worked soooo hard on this film to present it to you. If you get the extended DVD or at least rent it and take a look at some of the documentaries you will see the years of work. YEARS of hard work that went into this.

So what if it is missing or has changed a few things. At least these people dared to bring their love for this increadible story to life and presented it to all the world.

1463122,4,B00005JKZU,"I won't bother reviewing the film since there are already a gazillion of them, and you've probably already seen it in the theatre anyway. So I'm reviewing the theatrical-release DVD. Picture was sharp and contrasty, but a number of shots exhibited quite a bit of grain for some reason. Either there was very little grain, or a very noticeable amount, it's odd. That was occasionally distracting, but didn't ruin it for me; overall it looks very good. The sound is excellent, dialogue is clear and the sound effects will test your system as much as any soundtrack out there. No complaints there.
The extras are pretty weak in my opinion, with several exceptions. There are no audio feature commentaries by the director, actors, or anyone. We get some trailers, and an assortment of television and web documentaries that you've probably already seen. There is a very mediocre short film by Sean Astin that for some reason is in here. Now Sean seems like a nice guy, and a decent actor, but how his little film got onto a DVD that will be seen by many millions of people, I don't understand. My only explanation is ""filler"". It has nothing to do with LOTR except for the fact that Peter Jackson appears briefly in it, and it basically looks like your average undergraduate student film, but shot on really nice film stock.
The two features that are worth seeing are the preview of the DVD Extended Edition due out in a few months, and some sneak-preview clips of the third film, Return of the King. Of course all the extended edition preview makes you do is wish you hadn't bought this disc and instead saved for that one which will undoubtedly be much, much cooler, as was the one done for the first film.
So while the film itself is very good, and gets 4/5 stars from me, as does this disc, I suggest you just rent and wait to get the Extended Edition, which will probably get 5/5 stars from me for both the film and the DVD.",1062547200,2,1924,4.531609195402299

1463125,1,B00005JKZU,"I remember reading the Tolken books about 25 years ago, and I recall at the time I found them very entertaining.  So why do I find both movie renditions so boring?
True, it's been 25 years or so since I read the books and I'm sure my tastes have changed, but I don't remember the books being mostly about war.  I don't remember trying to figure out how Frodo could one minute be following Gollum and the next Gollum is nowhere in sight.
My suspicion is that the makers of the film are too caught up in the computer generated special effects and have forgotten that what makes a good movie is a good story.  Gollum is pretty good, but he does look like he could be a close cousin of Dobby the house elf out of Harry Potter.  The rest of the special effects seemed unbelievable.  The marching hordes had no real detail and appeared fuzzy to me.  The battle scenes had the same problem.  The figures of the non-humans always seemed to be moving just a little too fast for the ""camera"" to catch the details.
I have a further suspicion that the director was so interested in his special effects, that he forgot to try and get decent performances out of the actors and actresses involved in the project or to care about totally lame dialogue.  And by the end of the movie, I thought if Sam said ""Mr. Frodo"" one more time, I would scream!
The film makers are so interested in showing us zillions of beasties marching on what's left of civilization that they forget the need to deliver a coherent plot.  They are so interested in making nifty computer generated tree people that they've forgotten that not everyone has read the book within the last 3 months and it would be nice if they developed the people and the plot well enough for those of us who are not immersed in the ""Ring"" culture to be able to follow and perhaps enjoy the movie.",1062460800,9,1833,4.367647058823529

1463275,5,B00005JKZU,"I tried so hard to hold out for the Extended Edition release in November, but just couldn't wait that long to watch this movie a few times, so I went ahead and bought this.  This movie is just as wonderful as the first film, with only one difference:  The first film focused on all of Tolkien's characters and lots of history.  This film mainly focuses on humans. While ""Two Towers"" does stray a little from the original books, those strays do not distract or disturb the story in any way.  For instance, the elves never came to Helms Deep to help mankind in the big battle... but that sequence offered a wonderful sense of hope and is a favorite scene in many people's eyes who have not read the books.  I didn't mind the strays at all... in fact, I would rather the movies NOT follow the original story to a ""T"" because then no one would want to read the books to find out what really happened.
I won't go into what the movie is about because I think just about everyone in the entire world has seen this movie and there are hundreds of reviews here to tell you the story.  But, what I will focus on is the DVD extras.  Included is some short cast interviews about the Two Towers and the making of it.  There is a big teaser about the 43-minutes of extra footing that will be in the Extended DVD release and I can't wait to see it.  There were many Treebeard scenes that were cut out and many very interesting plot points.  They seem so pivotal to the story that I can only imagine the reason they were cut was because they didn't want us sitting in the theater for 4 hours!  There is also 12 minutes or so of what to expect from ""Return of the King"", which will not at all spoil anything, but does offer a general background of what events will take place.  If you're looking for glimpses of Shelob the spider or Sauron's physical form, you will not find it at all here.  But, like I said, they do give you a few clips to look at and a general discussion of what takes place.  Most people enjoyed the Helm's Deep battle, but this upcoming battle in the last movie dwarfs Helm's Deep!!
Is this DVD worth buying or should you hold out for the Extended DVD in November 2003?  Well, I couldn't wait that long.  I love this movie and it is a movie I can watch over and over.  The extras are not 5-star material, but they are ok - best being the sneak peak of the next movie and clips of extra scenes that will be added to the DVD release in November.  If you can hold out for the extended edition, I would.  But, if you are a 'freak of a fan' like I am of these movies, you won't mind buying both!

1463276,5,B00005JKZU,"Following in the tradition set by its predecessor ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"" continues where ""Fellowship"" left off.  The two hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) begin their journey to Modor to destroy the ring.  Along the way, they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a mysterious creature who agrees to be their guide, but Gollum is hiding a secret of his own.
Meanwhile, the battle between the forces of Sauron and the people of Rohan wages on.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have joined forces with the people of Rohan to thwart the attacks of Sauron's Orcs and his evil magician Saruman (Christopher Lee).  Determined to make Rohan an example in his desire to rid Middle Earth of Men, Sauron has unleashed his full fury against its people, but the people of Rohan, led by their king, once under Sauron's control but freed by Gandalf (Ian McKellen), have retreated to their mighty fortress of Helm's Deep.  It is here where they will stand and fight.
The battle scenes at Helm's Deep are the high point of the film.  The special effects are like none I've ever seen before.  I thought the ones in the first movie were good, but these are much better.  The acting is superb throughout, but I think Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom deserve special recognition.  Their characters of Aragorn and Legolas are my favorites, and the producers could not have picked two better actors to fill these rolls.

I would like to inform you that you are both wrong. The LOTR books would not make good films as they are, there are simply far too rich, they need to be abridged and simplified. However, Jackson did an absolutely rotten job of this. He needlessly added pointless action scenes such as those terribly animated ""warg"" riders (wargs are giant, intelligent, and malicous wolves, Pete) and the much hated Aragorn falling of the cliff and then wasting 30 minutes flashing back to liv tyler scenes. While simultaneously leaving out very important details such as Gandalf's journey to Isengard, where he shows Saruman what's what, obtains the palantir, and many other meetings and plot points. These details could have fit into a 3 hour movie if Jackson wouldn't have tried to ""improve"" on Tolkein by adding made up scenes. The Two Towers did do an amazing job on some things, such as Smeagol and Helm's Deep (so the evles weren't there in the book, get over it, i for one wanted a chance to seem some evles kick some ass and it did fit somewhat with themes present in the history of Middle Earth, which i think is what Jackson was getting at). So all in all I think the movie is a firm okay. Not really good, but not completely awful. It does make me sad though because it did seem to me that Jackson was a lot more faithful to the LOTR story in Fellowship and made it shorter by simply leaving things out (Tom Bombadil for example), but did not resort to adding a lot of new material the way he did in TT. Oh well, perhaps he is going the way of George Lucas, the success of the first movie must have deluded him to the point where he thought he could do a better job that Tokein. I guess Peter doesn't really understand the whole theme of LOTR which is sad. Power corrupts. Even if you desire power to do good you will do evil. In this case if you desire the power to change Tolkein to make a good movie you will make a bad one. Ironic isn't it.",1062460800,5,2211,4.381995133819951
1463279,5,B00005JKZU,"I almost never reply to other reviews but this time I had to. The simple reason is that in my opinion [some people] clearly don't have a clue about creating this kind of movie or book adaptations in general. Comparing it with Brideshead re-visited which is as far as I know only excellent as a tv-series is like comparing apples and oranges. Also, reviewing it from a vhs tape...brrrr.
Although I might agree about the way Frodo is portrayed it is also true that Frodo doesn't have much depth in the book either.
And true the short detour that Aragon takes of the cliff is pointles. The arrival of the elves at Helmsdeep, however, serves dramatic purposes in the movie that acutally work quite well. Besides it makes the odds of holding the keep a litle more realistic. Who cares whether this is in the book or not. The keyword here is adaptation! I am not interested in literally filming the book. What's the point?
I think what some Tolkien afficionado's don't realise that as far as the fantasy film genre goes filmhistory is made. There isn't any fantasy movie that even comes close this trilogy. And by the way in his spare time Peter Jackson makes funny litle horror movies like braindead and badtaste...
As far as a review should go I think TTT should get 4 out of 5 stars. This is largely due to the fact that I cannot think of any second part in a trilogy that is satisfying on it's own (unless of course it are relatively seperate stories - like the godfather movies).

More violent, fast paced, and with a more epic feel; The Two Towers is, as of this typing, the best action/fantasy adaptation yet; and while it may not take place exactly as Tolkien himself had written it, he himself would nod his head in approval of the fantastic job done by director Peter Jackson.

1463282,5,B00005JKZU,"Simply put, ""The Two Towers"" lives up to the standards the filmmakers set for themselves in the first film. It is remarkably faithful to the books, and it is an excellent film in any estimation.
The style established in the first film is maintained rigorously in the second. Colors, sounds, dialogue, effects, acting... all excellent, all used well. I cannot think of a single element with which I was disappointed, but there were a few things which stood out as particularly impressive.
The achievement and realization of Gollum as a character was better than I think anyone expected. Very quickly, I forgot while watching the film that he is essentially a virtual character, and what we see on the screen was created by digital artists (along with the incomparable Andy Serkis). Far from suffering from Jar-Jar Binks syndrome, Gollum becomes as real a character as any of the actors on-screen, with depth and feeling and even sympathy. I didn't expect to be given a Gollum I could believe in, but Jackson and his team surprised me here.
Even apart from Gollum, the effects of this second film were even better than the first. I can see that, as good as they were when they started the project, the artists working on Lord of the Rings have already begun to improve their talents, and it shows in the work. The massive battle sequence at Helm's Deep is only one example of the fine work they are doing now.
Howard Shore's music for the film has once again enchanted me thoroughly.  Shore is a talented composer for just about any film, but for Lord of the Rings he has clearly pulled out all the stops and created something completely new for him, but utterly perfect for the films. His epic, sweeping, emotional score is ideal for capturing the essence of the story. It's gotten to the point that listening to even a small portion of the music invokes memories of the films for me.
The actors chosen for Lord of the Rings could not be better, and in this movie they prove it even moreso than in the first. Driven to extremes of desperation and hopelessness, and still coming out the other side intact, they show their basic humanity and maintain a sense of who they are. Whether siding with good or evil, all the characters are essentially believeable, and that is a rare achievement.
The changes that were made for the film version of ""The Two Towers"" take a little getting used to for someone who has read the books, but they don't really detract from the story at all. Many of them actually seem to make the story more accessible, and to establish some plot point a little earlier or a little more clearly.
In many ways, ""Fellowship"" was an easier film to watch. ""The Two Towers"" seems somewhat depressing and dark in comparison, as well it should. This second film is a story about finding hope in the face of hopelessness. As each part of the story progresses, the characters progress deeper into the darkness that is engulfing the world. Sam expresses this explicitly near the end of the film, when he says that it gets to the point where you don't want to know what happens next anymore, because it seems that it can't possibly turn out well. These are people presented with insurmountable odds, but what makes it so compelling to watch is that they try anyway -- ""because there's some good left in this world... and it's worth fighting for.""
A few words about the DVD: it's a good-looking presentation, and the extras are fun and all worth watching. Sean Astin's short film, ""The Long and Short of It,"" is presented on the second disc, as is a 10-minute behind-the-scenes preview of the third film and a sampling of scenes that will be seen in the Extended Edition of ""The Two Towers."" Just as on ""Fellowship,"" the extras on ""The Two Towers"" are almost long enough to be a film in themselves, and they are all well-produced and worth watching.
All in all, a very well-done film. Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of the Rings is (so far) the best fantasy epic ever committed to film. Perhaps the only drawback to watching ""The Two Towers"" now is that it makes me even more anxious to see ""The Return of the King.""",1062374400,2,4130,4.603799185888738
1463283,4,B00005JKZU,"I love these adaptations of LOTR, and they are very well done. The acting and direction is all superb. Ian McKellon shines once again as Gandalf the White. The effects department has both the Balrog and Gollum pegged dead on, and the Ents are at least valiant effort - I'm sure all readers have them pictured differently.
Many ""changes"" form the book are necessary in a film version to compress time and to show things that cannot obviously be read. One example is the removal of the highly entertaining time Pippin and Merry spend with the Ents. Instead, it is replaced with a hasty attack on Isengard. Another example: we see Aragorn being uncertain of his destiny, doubtful, etc. in the movie when all readers know that by the time the books begin, he is quite sure of it and has planned it (with Gandalf's aid) for years. Some would call this an ""existentialist reading"" of his character, showing a depth that we don't see in the book, but which can be gotten from the appendix of ROTK.
I was irritated with what they did to Faramir's character, making him a miniature Boromir as well as the partial reduction of Gimli to comic relief duty. The first is an example of a large departure (Faramir's character is practically opposite of Boromir's), the second a small one; neither was required by the film medium. These gratuitous changes represent bad choices by the writers and directors who are often tempted to wander from the original. However ""not all who wander are lost"", and these changes do not detract greatly from the movie as a movie and should still be enjoyable by Tolkien fans.",1062374400,3,1594,4.6761565836298935
1463284,5,B00005JKZU,"Anyone who complains and quibbles about Peter Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings, especially the Two Towers, needs to pause and reflect on where we were only 2 years ago....with the exception of endlessly reading the books or listening to the very good audio version produced by the Mind's Eye, what else did we have? Well there was Ralph Barkshi's 70's animated attempt which, though it had it's moments, was a disaster and left incomplete. Then we had the animated TV version of The Hobbit which was fairly good considering the confines of time. This however was followed up by the rather pathetic Return of the King. Throughout all this time, we would read little snippets of news that director ""so and so"" was interested in producing a film version but it never would come to fruition.
Along comes Peter Jackson..not only does he tackle a work, that for some people, ranks higher than the Bible for scholarly interpretation, but he has the foresight to produce all three movies simultaneously and provide us with high quality entertainment for three consecutive years. I shudder to think what George Lukas would have done with Tolkien. Know one thing, like Star Wars, Lukas' Ring trilogy would have taken 12 years or more to complete, so let's be thankful that he did not get his hands on it.
Tolkien purists who complain about sections missing or changed need to put their egos on hold and realize that this movie was made for ALL audiences, not just for them. Sure there were things that annoyed me but, with a shrug, I realized that Jackson knows what he's doing and who am I to question him... how Faramir is handled is a perfect example...there was no real conflict in the original Frodo-Faramir encounter so Jackson probably realized that, since conflict propels a story forward, he needed to have Faramir behave like most Humans would when faced with the chance of taking the Ring. That is afterall, the centerpiece of the Ring, namely Man's lust and greed for power. And since Faramir does redeem himself at the end, he now is more align with Tolkiens original intent....Remember, this movie wasn't made just for Tolkien afficionados though they are the ones acting like monday morning quarterbacks regarding this film...it amazes me how short sighted some people are...So, everyone take a deep breath and relax and enjoy what is no doubt the epic masterpiece in fantasy film making...the extended version trailer shows great promise and the Return of the King featurette makes you long for winter's coming....",1062374400,3,2530,4.886046511627907

I give it five stars because of Gollum basically and just the sheer fact that this movie is being made and the organization, it takes to film in the locations with so many extras and have the special effects this movie has, and the CGI involved and the balancing of the book and screenplay.... just thinking about what it took to make three movies at the same time just boggles the mind, and to pull it off with this much of a seemless job to me is amazing.
But back to Gollum, not only is he amazing as a CGI charater, in that he works and looks flawlessly within the scenes. You forget he's totally computer generated and just pay attention to the acting of  Andy Serkis.... truelly a great job on the character.
I think the flow of the movie is better suited when seen with all three movies, as this seemed to be part of a trilogy, rather than a ""whole"" movie by itself.... besides this minor quibble... I am greatful to Peter Jackson in bringing this amazing world of middle earth to film.... Bravo!!.",1062288000,,1165,4.364055299539171
1463376,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers, Peter Jackson's second of three movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings, isn't a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring.  Instead, it is the continuation of a single storyline that, like its literary source, was broken up in three parts for manageability.  (Tolkien never envisioned his tale of the War of the Ring to be a ""trilogy"" of related books.  It is, in fact, a one-book narrative that publishers wisely broke up into three volumes for economic and practical reasons.)
With this structural concept in mind, Jackson doesn't resort to a Cate Blanchett-narrated summary of The Fellowship of the Rings to bring viewers up to date.  Instead the director takes up the plot where Fellowship left off, with Hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) making their way to the evil kingdom of Mordor, where they must climb Mount Doom and destroy Lord Sauron's powerful Ring.
Lost and tired, Frodo and Sam are wandering in the dangerous regions just outside Mordor when they are ambushed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), a twisted and tormented creature that had once been a Hobbit-like creature until, centuries ago, he found the One Ring.  Enslaved and transformed by the Ring's power, Gollum lives only for the possession of ""the precious.""  After a brief scuffle with Frodo and Sam, Gollum is apparently tamed and reluctantly agrees to take the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor.
Meanwhile, the rest of the now broken Fellowship follow separate paths.  Frodo and Sam's fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin (Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan) have been captured by Uruk-Hai who serve the traitorous wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).  They are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman has built Orthanc, one of the titular Two Towers (the other being Sauron's Barad-Dur in Mordor).  There, the evil White Wizard hopes to get his hands on the One Ring.  Pippin and Merry are seemingly doomed unless Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) can catch up to their captors and rescue them.
Of course, events intervene and things become far more complicated as the War of the Ring begins.  Saruman strikes first at the kingdom of Rohan from without and from within.  His armies of Orcs and Wild Men attack villages in a violent rampage of sword, wargs and fire.  Meanwhile, King Theoden  (Bernard Hill) has been weakened by Saruman with the aid of Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif); the once powerful warrior king is a half dead shell of a man who can barely lift his head while sitting on his throne.
But all is not lost, for Gandalf (Ian McKellen), thought to have perished during his battle with the Balrog in the mines of Moria, has returned, and although there will still be many challenges for the Fellowship to overcome, hope still lives on in Middle Earth.
Jackson, along with co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair, did take creative liberties with Tolkien's established storyline, but not to the film's detriment.  Now that the expository material has been dealt with in The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie seems less ponderous and a bit more action oriented.  The introduction of Rohan's shield-maiden Eowyn (Miranda Otto) adds poignancy to the romantic subplot of Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler), and we clearly see the effects of the Ring's power on Frodo.
Also notable are the special effects, particularly the CGI renderings of Gollum. Taking their cue from actor Serkis' amazing performance, the computer artists create a totally believable digital character.  Imagine a malignant and insane Dobby from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and multiply that image by a factor of 100, and you have Gollum.  The result is a totally believable character with all the shadings of a well-written role.
The Helm's Deep battle sequence that is the films effects centerpiece is equally impressive and rivals anything the effects wizards at Lucasfilm have created for the Star Wars prequels.
The New Line Home Entertainment DVD (in both Wide Screen and pan and scan formats) contains the original theatrical version (the Extended Edition is due in November 2003), with English audio tracks in Dolby Digital EX 5.1 Surround Sound and Stereo Surround Sound, English subtitles and closed captions, and Spanish subtitles.

1463378,2,B00005JKZU,"TWO TOWERS IN THREE HOURS
 Gee whiz, this sure was some movie! Action, adventure, pathos, violence, kissing--you name it, Two Towers has got it. I am so impressed by this masterpiece that I think somebody should turn it into a book. It might sell very well.
 (I've heard that there already is a book called ""The Two Towers,"" written in the 1940s by some Oxford philologist named, I think, Tolkien.  But Peter Jackson need not worry about using the same title for a book based on his movie. Nobody who has read Tolkien's book, and seen Jackson's movie, will ever confuse the two.)
 Two reviews for the price of one:
 Review for people who have never read Tolkien, and don't intend to:  This beautifully-photographed adventure film should delight you no end. The exciting events, the constant shifting from one perspective to another, the courage of the heroes, and the hilarious antics of that noted zany, Gimli the Dwarf, should wring the withers and lift the spirits of young and old alike. You may find the portrayal of Frodo Baggins (by Elijah Wood) a little, um, wooden: he excels at standing still and staring unblinkingly while trying to make up his mind to actually DO something. (He's also very good at falling down. His belly-flop into the Dead Marshes is especially impressive.) But he contributes greatly to the movie, by taking the concept of the ""reluctant hero"" to new and hitherto undreamed-of heights.
See the film, by all means. Those special effects will just knock your socks off, yessirree!
  Review for those who love Tolkien's masterpiece:  Take two aspirins and watch it. The opening will please you; then it's all downhill. You may feel angry at first, but eventually you'll probably start giggling. Did you know that Gimli was from Scotland? Listen to that accent grow! (At one point he even calls Aragorn ""laddie."") Did you know that Aragorn fell off a cliff into a river and disappeared for several days? Did you know that Thoden was a zombie, his body literally possessed by Saruman? Did you know that several hundred elves came to help the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep--where Thoden had moved the entire population of Edoras? Did you know... but why should I spoil this chef-d'oeuvre further, by giving away its innumerable ""improvements"" on Tolkien? You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe, you'll squirm, you'll wince (at the 200th close-up of Frodo's wide-eyed face). You certainly won't watch it twice, except for giggles. It's much worse than the first film.
Envoi:
 I did find myself wondering what Peter Jackson does in his spare time. Perhaps he writes improved versions of Mozart's symphonies, or touches up Rembrandts, or takes a chisel and enhances Michelangelo's David.
 I must admit I am very eagerly awaiting Part III. It should be a riot. Can we start a contest to predict how Jackson will end his epic? Based on what I have seen so far, I think that Aragorn will be living in a mnage  trois with Arwen and Eowyn; Frodo will become a mannequin in a shop window (since he is already almost indistinguishable from one); Gimli will get a job as a slapstick comedian at a nightclub in Minas Tirith; and Gandalf will become a full-time exorcist (""Begone, Saruman!""). You'll enjoy making your own guesses after you've seen this travesty. (What a pity it is that poor old Professor Tolkien couldn't think up all the neat things that Mr. Jackson has put into this wonderful film!)
 PS - Contrary to what some reviewers have said, it is not impossible to transfer a literary masterpiece to the screen without ruining it. Read Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, then watch the BBC series. Read Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra, then watch the movie. It can be done. But not by Peter Jackson. He is much too great a creative artiste to allow his brilliance to be stifled by the writings of a mere genius.

Anyone could nit pick but I believe that we as the audience owe it to the director to suspend all the pride and predjudice and watch as he unfolds the story for us. He has done everything that he could, and more, to follow the path of the ring-bearers, as well as the other main characters. As the story teller, he has remained true, without getting us lost in all the flash of special effects.

All in all it is not a movie you can just up and leave the room, you miss one second of The Two Towers you'll be confused. In the beginning I had no idea what was a dream and what was real, it went back and forth so much that after a few minutes you hoped they didn't go back into a dream sequence again. I enjoyed the movie, excellent casting, directing and a well written script. Take out the popcorn and don't move.",1062288000,,738,4.1678321678321675
1463381,5,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is just as good if not better than the first movie in the series.  Picking up where the first one left off, Towers perfectly continues the stories as the Fellowship has been broke up in the efforts to return the One Ring to the fiery pits of Mordor.  Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, the previous owner of the ring.  This is an excellent part of the story as Gollum decides what to do with them and Frodo begins to suffer more under the wrath of the ring.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find themselves in Gondor where they join with the king Theodin who is evacuating his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep.  Just like the first one, Towers leaves on a cliffhanger that leaves viewers desperately wanting to see more.  Also, the battle for Helm's Deep is one of the greatest battle sequences ever made and should not be missed.  The forces of both Sauron and Saruman converging on the stone fortress guarded by a much smaller opponent makes for a battle that is incredible too watch.  After watching the movie, check out the documentary on The Return of the King and the battles that will take place in that movie.  See what Peter Jackson says about those battles to put it all into perspective.  In one battle sequence, he says there will be as many as 200,000 warriors, on one side.
  The whole cast returns for this second installment and is just as good as the first one.  Elijah Wood as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellin as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Christopher Lee as Saruman, are all great in their performances, just as they were in the first one.  The DVD is very good offering widescreen presentation, theatrical trailers, an impressive preview of Return of the King, numerous documentaries, and so much more.  This is a great movie that should not be missed.  Fellowship and Towers are so far the greatest fantasy movies ever made.  I can't wait to see The Return of the King in December as well as the Special Edition 4-disc set coming out in November.  While the movie may differ from the book at certain points, it is still very good.  Fans of Tolkien will still love The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.

1463520,4,B00005JKZU,"This movie is amazing. It is the visually pleasing sequel to the movie adaption of one of the most amazing movies of all time: Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien's world is again brought to life by an amazing cast and technological crew. This second portion of the tale brings excitement, some interesting character development for new characters like Gollum, Wormtongue, and &Eacute;owyn, as well as enhancement of the stories of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Although this movie is interesting and truly other-worldly, it immerses viewers in a world very different from that of the ""Fellowship"". This second installment does feature good, emotionally intense moments (Frodo's further breakdown with the Ring, Gollum's dual nature, and Arwen's choice for a life with Aragorn contrary to the wishes of Elrond), but it does not have the same fantasy, dream-like feel of the first one. We will not marvel at the splendor of an Elfin palace nor feel at home in the Shire with Bilbo and Gandalf. Instead, we will watch a panoramic battle-sequence that speeds up the heartbeat but does not fill the heart entirely. The pacing of the movie is choppy at some points, but wonderful moments like Gandalf's assistance at Helm's Deep and the last march of the Ents bring back the feel of Middle-Earth. Some parts could have been avoided (Spoilers to follow....)
like Haldir's death, Aragorn's fall, and a few other moments. I will not nitpick, because these movies take a grand amount of effort, but keeping in more of the basic chapters of the Two Towers book would make the pacing a little better. (Why don't Merry and Pippin meet up with Aragorn and the others?!). All in all, a great movie that is immersing and worth watching again.",1062201600,,1759,4.906040268456376
1463521,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" follows the continuing saga of Frodo, the hobbitt entrusted with returning the sacred gold ring to Mordor to save middle earth from utter destruction.  As trilogies go I'm reserving my final judgment until I see part three.  But as sequels go I must say that this one fell a little short of my expectations. Yes, it is a breathtaking visual experience to behold and yes, equally stirring are the performances from the expansive cast of characters.  Yet there seems to be something of that spark of magic - so evident in the first movie - that is lacking in part two.
Unlike, say ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which is the second installment of the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy and is brilliantly and fully realized as both a sequel to the original film and a stand alone piece of fiction, ""The Two Towers"" cannot and does not function apart from the original ""Lord of the Rings"".  It needs the familiarity of Part One to encourage a viewer onward throughout its three hour plus running time.
TRANSFER: A stunning example of DVD's capabilities. The picture is rich, bold and vibrantly balanced.  The stylized picture is beautifully rendered.  Black levels are solid.  Fine detail, black and contrast levels are superbly realized.  Only the slightest hint of pixelization is detected as well as a modest amount of edge enhancement - though nothing to distract one from this visual experience.  The audio is 5.1 and astounding in its bass and spread across all five channels.  This soundtrack really rocks the house.
Extras: Too many to go into detail but the 10 minute teaser for ""The Return of the King"" is nicely done.  Ditto for the documentary on the making of part two, although it strangely has the look, feel and flavor of the documentary on the making of part one.  A few other featurettes round out your DVD viewing enjoyment.
BOTTOM LINE: If you own part one then you'll want to get part two.  Personally, I'm hoping that the third installment will bring everything to a justifiable climax, something I found lacking in ""The Twin Towers"".",1062201600,,2056,4.7740112994350286

The environments and special effects make each frame suitable for a book cover. The look and feel of this film is very much enjoyable. The action scenes are energetic and suspenseful. In the last movie the big action scene was with a huge fire monster. In this one the peak is with what seems like an unwinable war. Fantastic.

But this movie, as well as the Fellowship, is just amazing to me.  The books of course give much more detail and information, and although the movie seems to skim over a bit, I feel it added so much more intensity at the same time.  To me, being able to see the character's emotions and feelings instead of the way Tolkien only hinted at them in the books makes the story more enjoyable.
The movie was intense and wonderful, especially the creature Gollum.  It just felt right. Some things just work, and this movie did.  Even though in the book, Arwen was not even mentioned, I think she was referred to once or twice, I really thought the scenes with her were worked in beautifully.  You could actually see that as something Tolkien might have skimmed over in his books!  I think the making of these movies was ingenious!  I can't imagine anyone seeing The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers and not being consumed with frustration at the end for closure!

I was still tense at Helm's Deep, even though I new what would happen, I still felt for Gollum and Arwen. True magic to make me care even when I knew what would happen!
Star Wars notwithstanding. PJ and his crew sweated blood and tears for nearly 4 years to make this, and did far better than a typical US Hollywood director.
Thank God that New Line Cinema had the guts to make 3 movies, we are lucky that a crew that loved the book made it, not a crew that had no personal interest.
The special extended edition looks like it will top even the 2 towers.

The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is superb and its amazing at how much attention to detail was given to the sets, costumes, makeup, etc...  Despite a few departures from the book, both Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers succeed on a grand scale of transferring a very complex novel onto film.  I agree with the person who commented that no one, including ""purists"", would want to watch a 15 hour movie!  That is why there are novels, one can read all the minute details at one's own pace.  Furthermore, I urge overly zealous purists not to allow a few details ruin the sheer enjoyment of these marvelous films, they are well worth watching!

1463527,5,B00005JKZU,"The Twin Towers is a sizzling page turner for the eyes, a magnificent effort.  I was most taken by the taffey-like tug of war within the minds of Gollum and Frodo.  There were only a few minor stumbles and who cares if the storyline was not followed exactly as we are swept away with dazzling special effects and scintillating action.
Gollum had to win the character prize in my eyes, a breathtaking job by Andy Serkis depicting Gollum as the wiry,anguished, twitching, tortured and pathetic Barney Fife in a loin cloth.  The rescue of Frodo in the spooky bog cemented a bond of trust that was heartbreakingly broken later.
Gollum stole the show, but the Ents saved the day as the powerful sheperds of the forest put on a dazzling visual feast, smashing orcs and wrecking Saruman's realm.  Chris Lee is without peer as an actor as he plays the ice-cold Sauruman, but the Ents had the normally stoic Sauruman scrambling in disbelief at his evil console, an unforgetable blow against evil.
This epic is full of transformations to go along with the continuing wonderful performances of Gimli, Legolas and even Aragorn.  Grima Wormtongue is a wonderful addition, the type of slippery and evil character that makes you want to head for the showers just for looking at him.
This movie is a must see and must buy.  I'm glad that I waited for the DVD widescreen, the pictures and sounds on a HD Plasma were top notch, as is the movie.  Top pick!",1062115200,,1437,4.633858267716535

Spectacular audio and video even in the most intricate scenes. This is a must for any LOTR lover and I think it might be the best of the three. There are a few mistakes which have been pointed ou previously, though Faramir's feelings about the ring are completely wrong and a few other details. However I loved the film and I wonder how come there have been many criticisms and very petty and few Oscars have been awarded. Gollum is simply unbelievable and the battle of Helm's Deep breathtaking. I also think that the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. The extra's are more on the production then the background of Middle Earth, and that dissapointed me a bit. I give it 5 stars for it cannot receive less, it's one of the ""big ones"" in the history of cinema. Few fantasy films have had the same success. I watched both the French and the English version and I was very satisfied. The only thing that really dissapoints me, I must say, is that I cannot see the extra scenes. I'll find a remedy ;)!!!!!

1463687,5,B00005JKZU,"I, being of sound mind and body (I hope), do declare that I have seen TLOR : TWO TOWERS at the movies, and now on DVD in the privacy of my own home, without harm to myself or others. No long dead author was heard turning in his grave, nor did the World stop spinning as I unashamedly revelled in Peter Jackson's grand cinematic portrait of Middle Earth. The same goes for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - viewed without harm to mind or body. The world did not end, darkness did not fall, and the Gods did not strike me down.
This time.
All this and more may well have come to pass if the Tolkien PURISTS are to be believed. Their wails of despair echo through these reviews (infrequently), rising from the mire of joyous 5 star rave reviews like Ring Wraiths looking to score a labotomy. Knives are sharpened, poison pens are readied, all seeking the demise of the man who dared to breathe new life into Tolkien's vision - a vision that sadly came to fruition long before it was possible to bring it to life on the big screen.
Beware the fanatics my friends, beware those that cannot accept that they are no longer alone, that their PRECIOUS literary masterpiece has been torn from their clinging hands and thrust into the light of day for millions to enjoy. Are they bitter, are they jealous, or has somone forgotten to tell them that its only a book? A fantastic book, a book so grand in its conception and ultimate telling that few rival it, but a book none-the-less.
Sad but true.
I've read TLOR and loved every page, every elgantly painted moment of imagination and yet I found the courage from somewhere to embrace the movies too, to accept the fact that they would not be entirely faithful to the Great Work, as if they ever could be. I used that most useful of our evolutionary assests, my brain, and came to find the truth of it all - that the movies are a separate entity unto themselves, and cannot - SHOULD NOT - be compared word of word, scene for scene with their printed forebears.
Film studios don't have enough money to make a LOR movie that adheres exactly to the novels, nor would people have the courage required to sit through such a movie. Anyone that can't work this out - these so called ""purists"" - are as stated: Deaf, Dumb and Blind. Perhaps instead of fretting over how Peter Jackson (AKA GOD) has butchered their beloved masterpiece, they might want to crawl out of their dim dark caves, stand upright and face the REAL WORLD head on. Try it - go on, I dare you.
Do I seem bitter, angry at the few and far between members of society that have decried Jackson's epic? Yes, I am. I admit it unashamedly. I try to be tolerant, I really do, but sometimes I just can't take it, and I have to vent my frustration with those among us that just don't understand that there are more important things in life other than whether or not Peter Jackson adapted TLOR word for word.
On a more base level, and by way of a Public Health Warning, I also want to wring the necks of anyone whore DARES refer to Peter Jackson as an Aussie - for those of you who are geographically challenged (ignorant) or live in Hicksville USA, he's a New Zealander (we're the little slice of paradise - AKA Middle Earth - just to the east of Australia). The Aussies are responsible for those dreary Star Wars and Matrix sequels / prequels - shot by US directors I might add. We New Zealanders on the other hand, have only the LOR movies to be proud of, directed by one of our own.
So, to my point. Purists be damned. These movies are just that - movies. Books are books, movies are movies. A literal translation of TLOR books to the big screen would be IMPOSSIBLE, so why the hell are people whining about it? Can't they just go and sit in a corner with all the Star Wars fans and scratch their eyes out like everyone else and pretend it didn't happen?
My suggestion therefore, for those troglodites still clinging to a zealous, PURITANICAL view of Tolkien's vision: GET A LIFE!!! The movies will never surplant TLOR's place in literary history - how could they? What they do however accomplish, is to capture the essence of what Tolkien wrote about, the FEEL of good and evil, of Light and Dark. All that is good about Tolkien's work is reflected in Jackson's own, and if you can't look past the sometimes obvious liberties he's taken and see the soul of the movies, then I don't relly think you're a true Tolkien Fan.
There's a good reason why the vast majority of people that have seen these movies have been ensnared by them. Its because they do capture what Tolkien envisioned when he wrote TLOR, and you can't help but feel that. The delivery might not be word for word, scene for scene, but the message is unaltered, and that's all that should matter to you.
So, enjoy the LOR trilogy in print, at the Theater, or on DVD. Don't waste what time is owing to you on this world by quibbling over details. Watch, read, enjoy Tolkien however he comes to you. Be grateful, don't be petty and covetous of his work. It reflects only on you, after all.

Make sure when purchasing that you choose the widescreen version of the film as there is no real difference in the packaging.  It says accross the top which version you are purchasing, make sure you have what you want. (widescreen)  This is one film that is horrid if not seen in it's original intended format.
I want to make this informative without giving away any plot points.  The special features are excellent with a bonus short film by Sean Astin (Samwise).  Several making of's and featuretts.  The best feature is a 10 minute preview of the third installment, Return of the King.  Due out in December in a theatre near you.
This is not the version with the 43 minutes of additional footage, that will be coming out later in a four disc set.  If you have read the books, you must see the film.  If you have seen the film, you must read the books.  There is nothing small about this movie or this series.  It is simply gigantic.

1463689,5,B00005JKZU,"Plenty of people have criticized Peter Jackson's The Two Towers movie because there are so many departures from the book, far more than in The Fellowship of the Ring. As a Tolkien fan for over thirty years, I too was dismayed at first by such interpolations as Aragorn's flirtatious moment with Eowyn over dwarf beards, or the repeated playing off of Gimli the Dwarf as the butt of numerous jokes.  But then I came to realize that any written work, even one so sumptuous as The Lord of the Rings, faces numerous difficulties in translation to the screen, and that in Peter Jackson and his team, Tolkien's masterpiece has been fortunate indeed.
The Two Towers is an extremely complicated work to film, split as it is between two different journeys, that of Frodo with Sam to Mordor and secondly the tangled stories of the remainder of the Fellowship.  In the movie the scene shifts back and forth, sometimes rather abruptly, but in the end it smoothly finishes off at real turning points for all the characters.  The settings are magnificent: the plains of Rohan, the tower of Orthanc, the deadly approaches to Mordor, Fangorn Forest, and the ravaged garden of Ithilien.  The action fits the settings:  huge battles and world changing decisions.  The cast fits as well, most of the familiar characters from The Fellowship of the Ring return of course, but there are many new faces, among the most appealing being Theoden King of Rohan and his nephew and niece Eomer and Eowyn. As in The Fellowship of the Ring, some of the most emotional moments come when Tolkien's own words are used, my favorite being the final scenes when Sam and Frodo laugh about the tale of Frodo and the Ring and Samwise the Brave. That emphasizes how fortunate the books were to have been filmed by a group of true Tolkien lovers.
The DVD contains quite a bit of interesting additional material on the making of the film, plus a peek at The Return of the King and another peek at the Extended Version, which will contain about 40 more minutes of material.  This last feature is truly fascinating, with hints of additional scenes of Pippin and Merry with Treebeard, among others.  But even if the only thing you watch is the theatrical release itself, this DVD is well worth the price!",1062028800,12,2258,4.69873417721519
1463690,3,B00005JKZU,"This review contains some spoilers, so please don't read it if you have a problem with that.
I am not a Tolkein ""purist"" in the sense that I feel that any time the movie leaves out something from the book it is a bad thing.  I am fully aware of the task of translating such a complex, lengthy book into a movie.  I am also fully aware that to do so, not only must some things be left out, but that things must also be changed.  I don't have a problem with those concepts, and for the most part they have done a good job of overcoming these obstactles in these films.
HOWEVER...
Some of the changes they have made in the film have not only been unnecessary from a time standpoint, they have also SERIOUSLY detracted from Tolkein's vision.  This, I do have a problem with.
--The filmmakers seem to have a real problem with the concepts of nobility and honor.  I guess they must think these traits would seem too unreal in the modern age.  I can't think of any other reason for the deliberate reduction of these traits in the movies.
--The character of Aragorn has had much of his nobility removed.  In the movies, he is portrayed as running from his role as king.  This was not the case in the books, where he was merely waiting for the proper time for his ascension to the throne.
--In the movies, the battle of Helm's Deep happened because the people of Rohan were trapped there by the Orcs while they were running away from the fight.  In the books, they were riding out to fight.  So Theoden's nobility has also been diminished.  He goes from being a hero to being a coward.
--In the movie, Elrond seriously criticizes Arwen for her decision to stay with Aragorn, then shows her eternally young while he ages and dies.  In the book, she gives up her mortality to be with him.  This is a more nobel sacrifice on her part, and Elrond is not nearly so petty regarding her choice.
There are other examples, but I think these are enough to document the theme I see.  None of these changes were necessary to make the story flow better.  Indeed, I think they take something vital from the story.
Other than these issues, I think they have been doing a superb job with the adaptations.  The visual effects are astounding, and they have created a world that looks like Middle Earth should.",1062028800,9,2282,4.38479809976247
1463691,3,B00005JKZU,"Some of Carl's points are well taken.  The entire book can not possibly be captured in a 3 hour movie, nor will people want to sit through 15 hours of film. However, this story offers so much to choose from without deviation from the original storyline, that there is no reason to fabricate events that never happened in the book.
- Why must Aragorn fall off a cliff in a battle that he was never actually in?
- Why was Faramir's decision changed from allowing Frodo to pursue his quest, to taking him to Gondor?
- Why did they make Frodo face the Nazgul and offer him the ring in Gondor, if he was never supposed to be there in the first place?
- Why did they change Faramir's personality to match his brother's when the whole point was the differences in their decisions? Boromir tries to take the ring while Faramir chooses to release it.
Need I go on?  I'm not saying that this was a bad movie or a failure, BUT it could have been much better if they followed the original story line within the time constraints. Rewriting parts of the story is unnecessary when you have such a wealth to events choose from.",1062028800,,1111,4.36231884057971

I'll still take this movie over just about any other I've seen lately.  I've met lots of people who never read the books, and I can understand why they like the movie just as it is.  The effects are awesome without smothering the story, Gollum is perfect, and the whole thing does rock.
But I do have to agree with a lot of what the ""purists"" are saying.  Fellowship departed from the book in a lot of small ways, but only one of them (Aragorn's wishy-washy self-imposed exile) really altered the storyline, and they were probably done to establish the characters more quickly.  The book had a lot of islands in the story (Tom Bombadil) that were removed without a loss.
The Two Towers movie went a lot further with the creative license, and I think the storyline is hurt.  I agree with keb that Faramir was completely hijacked, as were the Ents. In the book, they deliberated for days about fighting Saruman, but in the end, they _agree_ to.  Had they not, no amount of well-intended trickery on the part of the hobbits would have changed their mind.  They were meant to have personalities befitting ancient forces of nature:  their minds move like a mighty river whose course does not change easily.
Then there's how the movie ended.  What was that?  The book ends with Sam stuck in Mordor by himself, with Frodo a prisoner and in very bad shape.  How perfect would that have been as a cliffhanger?  To make matters worse, they took the time they saved by ending the movie ""early"" and blew it on a side plot about Aragorn falling off a cliff and coming back the next day. Not to mention inventing a conflict among Elrond, Arwen and Aragorn about their relationship (and embellishing the attraction between Aragorn and Eowyn).  In the books, Elrond doesn't have a big problem with Arwen and Aragorn.  He seems to think surrendering her elvish nature to wed Aragorn is fitting; the only involvement the Elves can have in the coming ages.  His brother, after all, did the same thing thousands of years ago and became Aragorn's distant ancestor.
The elves at Helm's Deep are annoying for the exact reasons laid out elsewhere:  the Elves, as a faction, were ""done"" with Middle-Earth in that capacity.
Saruman's possession of Theoden was also a little overdone.  The book seems to imply a much more mundane sort of enfeeblement for Theoden; he was getting old and had lost his will to fight.  Saruman's main involvement was to send Grima along to insulate him and keep him plied with bad advice.
I wish they'd spent a bit more time on the aftermath of the battle at Isengard.  The book's rendering of the tension in the air as Saruman trues to BS his way out of trouble with the major characters was really great.  I don't think they did it justice.",1062028800,,2765,4.592668024439918

1463834,5,B00005JKZU,"Wow!  This is the only expression that can escape my lips as I stare awestruck at the ending credits...
  See, I didn't have the opportunity to watch this in the theaters, but knowing how great ""Fellowship"" was, I couldn't wait to see this DVD.  A couple points to highlight here...
1)It's an absolute work of art!  Every scene has the perfect amount of lighting and color, and the locations should all grace the front of postcards.  Just watching the likes of Frodo, Aragorn, Pippen, etc. in these fantastic places will make you feel as if you're there with them, enjoying some sites, and dreading others.  Amazing!
2)The acting is simply phenomenal!  Every word spoken and every implied gesture shows the dedication the entire cast had in the making of this epic.  The passion in the voice, actions, and eyes found in every actor, in every scene, cannot be found at this level in even many ""high profile"" films.  Outstanding!
3)Music to the world's ears!  The music is exceptional in every scene.  Music can make or break even the greatest of movies, but every piece here is made exclusively to portray just the right emotion for each scene.  It never overpowers, but perfectly compliments the performance of the actors and visual effects team.  Beautiful!
4)Special effects make the heart grow fonder!  Well, they do in this case.  An incredible amount of time has been spent on the likes of Gollum, the orcs and masses of creatures and characters, random spell and lighting effects, and the color scheming of each and every frame of this movie.  The effects become a part of the world, and never overshadow the world they are in.  Superb!
5)Little things mean a lot!  All of the other details, such as direction, staging, camera angles, choreography(wait until you see the awesome action sequences, along with my boy Legolas in action!), costumes, miniatures, etc.  Making a book trilogy as legend as Lord of the Rings into these epic films is a project not to be taken lightly.  The books are of such a grandiose scale that not every minute detail could make it onto the screen.  Picking and choosing the direction and flow of the sequences, as well as the sequences themselves, in such a way as to do service to this epic is a daunting task indeed.  The success of this film, along with it's predecesor(and I'm sure ""Return of the Kings"" as well...we'll soon see!), could only happen with a massive group effort and incredible dedication to this project.  The long hours and effort really shows!  The end result is a cherished film adaptation that all can enjoy.  Note that these films serve to compliment the masterful work of Mr. Tolkien, and not to replace his epic. So enjoy the visual greatness of the films, and enjoy the minute details of the books in this complimentary fashion.  From all perspectives, this is a tale that will invite your very heart to a warm place that you'll want to venture again and again.
  As for the DVD, yes the extended version will be the cream of the crop, as was the case last year with ""Fellowship of the Ring""'s extended version.  If you just want to get your fix before the November release date, then renting this version until that time may suffice.  I have an ownership problem(I hate renting), so like last year, I'm getting both versions.  This is just my complex though; if you do consider getting one version of this movie, get the extended version.  If you don't want to wait, then sure...get this theatrical version.  In any case, at least rent it...you will not be disappointed.  So go ahead, experience for yourself this masterpiece of ""wow""!",1062028800,,3600,4.733118971061093
1463835,5,B00005JKZU,"Most of us have seen this movie, and we either like it or dislike it. The Tolkien purists have been complaining since 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. When I saw 'The Two Towers', I just knew that I'd hear about the changes that took place from book to movie. First off, I've read all three books (plus, 'The Hobbit'), and I love them. Yes, wargs attack the Rohirrim and Aragorn falls off a cliff after the attack. Yes, Elrond sends Haldir and some other elves to aid at Helm's Deep. Yes, Merry and Pippen see Gandalf in the forest. And Gandalf plays 'The Exorcist' for a bit by expelling Saruman's spirit from Theoden. And yeah, Pippen tore off his brooch with his mouth. Who cares? I enjoyed the changes. There were several more, but I don't want this to be too long. I thought that the changes brought something to the movie. The only explanation I have for the elves at Helm's Deep is that Peter Jackson wanted to include them so it would be a little more realistic that Aragorn's forces could hold. Or maybe he just liked elves. Hehe. I can just imagine him, sitting in his director's chair: ""More elves!"" But anyway, you have to expect SOME stuff to change when a book is adapted for a movie. Sometimes, the changes are good--like in this movie. Sometimes, they're not. Believe me, Peter Jackson could've done a far worse job. The trilogy could've resembled those hideous cartoon movies of the 70's. Oh yeah, and I LOVED the Ents! How cool were they?! My favorite scene in the movie is ""The Last March of the Ents"".

1463837,5,B00005JKZU,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second edition to this trilogy.  This action packed movie is one of few that lives up to the original.  The action isn't the only detail that attracts audiences.  So do the special effects and most important...the genius storyline.  Drama and elaborate scenes combine surely pleasing J.R.R. Tolkin, the book author.
Peter Jackson, the director, the producer, and the writer, proudly presents his sweat and tears.  He's worked nonstop since 1999 perfecting every detail.  He leads the crew to make a seamingly impossible task look easy when actually, it's one of history's hardest movie creations.  The set and the buildings look real, but the construction took almost a year to complete with just ""The Two Towers"".
Every actor performs every drop of heart and soul as did Peter Jackson in his duties.  Elijah Wood proves as Frodo Biggings that he'll perfect more demanding roles in the years coming.  Other Oscar worthy performances are noted by Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, Orlando Bloom, and others.  They give their characters the necessary emotions for the audience to feel in their hearts.
Those interested in this movie are advised to watch ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" first.  Otherwise, one will be clueless to many scenes.  This is the continuation of the journey to destroy the ring before it takes over the world; therefore, creating widespread evil.  ""The Two Towers"" keeps the audience's eyes wide open waiting for the next intense action scene.
Afterward, watch the special features.  It includes a sneak preview of the next trilogy chapter, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" with a behind-the-scenes look.  Sean Astin's short film feature is viewing worthy.  It stars four ""Lord of the Rings"" crew members including the legendary Peter Jackson.  The WB-special originally aired on November 2002 informs how ""The Two Towers"" was made.  All other features are worth watching.  The ensemble will not leave the audience disappointed....

1463840,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers"" is a step-up from ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Bigger and better, Peter Jackson has succeded in bringing the first two novels of Tolkien's epic trilogy to life on the screen. The Battle of Helm's Deep is without a doubt the best battle scene ever committed to film as of now (From all reports, The Battle of Minas Tirith in ""The Return of the King"" will make Helm's Deep look like a skirmish).
The first DVD release of ""The Two Towers"" is pretty much the same as the first DVD release for ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" The documentaries, which are short but informative, are from television and lordoftherings.net. The best features are the previews for the Extended DVD Edition of ""The Two Towers,"" and the exciting ten-minute preview for ""The Return of the King.""
Overall, this is an incredible DVD to buy. I highly recommend it!

1463841,3,B00005JKZU,"Fantastic 5.1 audio, seamless special FX and superb cinematography (not to mention continued stellar performances from all involved) make this a phenominal production without question. In the ever growing trend of mediocre-at-best sequels, LOTR: The Two Towers stands tall and mighty indeed with standout sequels alongside the likes of The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, and your coice of Indiana Jones follow-ups.
From that standpoint alone I purchased this release, and as such am not dissatisfied.
From a content perspective however, I must say that those responsible for the release could be best coined ""lords of the marketing"". I understand two more DVD box sets are enroute. Extra footage (40+ minutes) which is excellent of course, and 2 (two) DVDs of additional content. Fantastic! However, I think it a bit of a stretch to include so little 'bonus' content on this release. Yes, the teaser 10 minute preview of Return of the King is great, but it feels as if the additional content was intentionally curtailed in order to justify TWO additional DVD box sets... Come on guys.  Sound design, a few cheezy prime-time special behind the scenes featurettes, and a completely unrelated 'mini-movie' do not justify an additional content DVD by any stretch of the imagination, and personally, I feel is an borderline shameful addition to such a fantastic film. Hopefully the upcoming box set(s) will include more interresting, in-depth content such as storyboard-to-screen multi-angle comparrisons and 'how we did it' featurettes we've  come to expect from 99.9% of all effects-ladden releases since the Matrix... How about the fact that the process of filming three films simultaneously has never been done before? Key scene deconstructions? Actor/actress screen tests? Bloopers/Gag Reels? Look at the bonus DVD for Star Wars: Episode I or the Matrix, or Fight Club. THOSE are bonus DVDs.
A lot of work, yes, but this film DESERVES it, don't you think?
I would rather have it given to us with both barrels (er, towers in this case) in the deluxe 4 disc edition as opposed to a mediocre-at-best initial release. I understand the ""need"" for a DVD#2 as it is ""standard"", but I at least feel the standard should be met, don't you?
Fanstastic Scren-to-DVD transfer. The move gets 5+ stars. The Bonus DVD gets 1 star, bringing my rating WAY down to 3 stars.
The sad part is, like me, SO many of you will buy it to have it NOW, and if additional content is of value to you, more than likely purchase on of the upcoming box sets in Oct. Oh well. They have to pay for these epics somehow right?",1061942400,,2586,4.928899082568807

-Why make did PJ make Faramir such a jerk? That was a real bummer.
-What was with the cliff scene at the Black Gate? Cheesy.
-Merry tricks the Ents into trashing Isengard? Gimme a break.

That never happened in the book!"" or ""Wow! That was totally messed up!"" but I must agree some of the changes made were for the BETTER! When i say better I don't mean take Gimli's axe an hack up Tolkien's work, but I mean it is for the better of the movie. Tolkien didn't get as into the love story as the movie did, granted, but the love story makes it more appealing for a large audiance. Now people can root for Aragorn cleaving off an Uruk Hai head as much as they can root for him to marry Arwen.
Also, I have heard it so many times my head is going to explode. yes we know the elves didn't go to Helm's Deep. And that is perfect for the book, but when you see 10,000 Uruk Hai marching to Helm's Deep and 300 rohan soldiers, which a large portion is old men and children, you gotta wonder how are they ever going to pull this off? Petter Jackson made a good move in my oppion in making the elves go to Helm's Deep for two reasons. I think the non-reader would actually be saying ""How did 300 soldiers hold off those Uruk Hai like that?"" Rohan needed help, and in order to make the survial look possible, those elves were needed. Also, a overwhelming majority of people love elves, so what better a way that to show them fight at Helm's Deep, looking crisp and ready for action! I believe that Peter Jackson made a smart move there.
i will say this though, Aragorn falling off the cliff? That was....weird. On a more comic note, imagine waking up to his horse? Scary huh? But the whole falling off the cliff made it possible to explore the love a little more. Because in the book, it kind of seemed the love theme was diffently out of it, and sort of appeared out of no where in return of the king.
Overall I rate this movie very highly and recommend it to anyone. It is hard to juggle waiting till Novemeber to get the special edition or buying the one released. So I say go for the special edition and borrow the one released from a friend.",1061856000,,2114,4.1838235294117645

1463975,4,B00005JKZU,While it didn't adhere as faithfully to the book as most LOTR fans would like.  The Two Towers is still an incredible movie experience.  Andy Serkis' perfomance of Gollum alone is worth the price you pay for the DVD.  The special effects are top notch and blend seamlessly with the action and the storyline.  This stands in stark contrast with the recent Star Wars films whose digital worlds seem sterile and the special effects seem like a desperate attempt at a distraction from the bad acting and weak plot.  Unlike most action/adventure fare that is released today The Lord of the Rings trilogy actually has dynamic characters that the become intimate with the audience and a storyline that quickly engrosses the viewer.,1061856000,,724,4.901639344262295

1463977,4,B00005JKZU,"This film is an Epic film in its own right, the script the scenery, the special effects (gollum is absolutely marvellously done and its a crime it didn't get the oscar).
I enjoyed this movie immensely, but felt rather sad that Mr Jackson felt the need to add his 'personal touch'.
The first movie in this trilogy was brilliantly done, we got to know the characters in depth and even though it strayed oft from the exactness of the first book it really did so out of necessity (as most audiences would have fallen asleep 30 minutes into the movie if it had kept to the book).
However, the second book needed no enhancements (except maybe some humour, in which Jackson neatly introduced the fast growing friendship of Gimli and Legolas as such). But the elves at helms deep just blew it for me, the legends of the ""last alliance of elves and men"" just got thrown out the window, Jackson destroyed the feeling if middle-earthness within the movie. It left a sour taste in my mouth.
But having said that, im still buying it the day it comes out as it is still a wonderful movie to behold. I just hope Jackson gets back on track with the final movie as there really is no need for any deviation at all, as the last book is packed full of action to a point where most who read it consider it should have been twice the size.",1061856000,,1318,4.340080971659919

Gollum has to be a landmark in digital characters.  One other note is that it has more changes from the book than Fellowship did, but I won't criticize since I can't even begin to imagine what adapting a massive story like ""Lord of the Rings"" to cinema would be like.  Peter Jackson had a huge task, and I'm sure we'll here all about his reasons for the changes in the Extended Edition commentary.
Anyway, the features of this disk (inc. a preview of the Return of the King movie, a preview of the ROTK game, and a preview of the Extended Edition to name a few) are a great appetizer for the Extended Edition.  I also like how the menus keep in line with the first DVD edition of ""Fellowship.""  Even once the Extended Edition comes out, I would keep this as it represents the director's orginal work and there are things on this DVD that won't be on the Extended Edition.

Despite the fact that I want to personally remove Peter Jacksons genetilia and digest them and feed him my excrements.
  The movie was excellent.  Once I forced myself to forget that I had read the book I realized the movie was still very good.  Although I refused to forgive pj's for sacriglegiously marring the charecter of Faramir.  I'm praying this Aussie schvatza doesn't do the same to the ROTK.  All fans of the book know to hate the director.  But, don't hate the movie.  The movie has excellent musical score, unprecendented scenery and prop use, and extraordinary charecter development.

I believe I read the entire LOTR trilogy 7 times over a period of 30 years; I was never really able to visualise Gollum until now! What a magnificent combination of acting and special effects. The portrayal of a poor creature torn between an all-consuming desire for posession of the ""precious"" and his ""master"" , (Frodo Baggins) was terrific!
As I commented earlier, this is not the greatest movie of all time , but it certainly is probably the best FANTASY movie. Yes--the book was better--a consummate masterpiece within the genre; but who cares? 5 stars for acting; 5 stars for scenery ; 5 stars for special effects (especially the Ents!) ; 4 stars for the film version of the book.

Anyway it's a richer character than the Faramir from the book so I gues we can forgive them for that.
Anyway I can't wait to get the extended edition, specially with those 40 plus minutes. I guess that Gollum's story is gonna be there.
I think that the producers did an excellent job portraying the world of Tolkien and the essence of the plot and the drama. Telling a story in a film is very different than in a book cause all the things that you imagine while you read have to be shown in a couple minutes.

1464284,1,B00005JKZU,"Sure, this movie is absolutely fantastic, but that doesn't mean you're going to buy this marketing ploy, does it?
No, what you want to do is wait until November 18th, when they release the Platinum Extended Edition. This version, has four disks, like 10 hours of bonus stuff, comentary, and all that good stuff. But, even if you're into that extra stuff, the feature itself has been extended.
That's right. If you wait 3 months to get the platinum edition, the actual movie itself has been EXTENDED by over 1/2 hour. Instead of having a deleted scenes feature, Jackson has finished up those scenes, and seamlessly re-intergrated them into the film (in some instances, this meant a re-write of the soundtrack).
All of this sound familar? That's because they did the same thing with Fellowship last year, and they'll be doing it again with ""Return of the King"" next year no doubt.
This first release is just a sucker marketing ploy, the studio knows dumb people will go out and buy it, unaware that a MUCH better version is only a 3 months away. Quite clever really, staggering the releases of the DVDs just gets them more money from dumb people.
In conclusion;
- Don't be dumb.
- Wait for Platinum on Nov 18th.

As far as the controversy surrounding the films and the books, its impossible to be 100% faithful to a story that contains so many nuances and lore behind it.

My only bone to pick is with the part where Aragorn falls off the cliff. If you've read the book(s) you know how silly that is (Aragorn DOESN'T fall off cliffs that easy) and how it doesn't seem very Tolkien-ish in its style.
Other than that, its great, and the features seem really cool. I'm getting it.",1060819200,,646,4.483050847457627
1464413,5,B00005JKZU,"The first time I watched ""The Two Towers"" I was a little confused and disappointed.  I was expecting the movie to follow the book a lot closer.  The second time I saw it I put the book out of mind completely and found the movie brilliant.  Granted Peter Jackson did use some artistic license with the story line, but I think it's for the better.  After reading the trilogy for probably the 10th time, I think it would have been difficult for him to follow the story line to the letter.
Before criticizing the movie, you need to understand even though millions have read the Trilogy, the majority of people haven't.  I took my nephews to see the Fellowship and then The Two Towers.  Neither of them have read the Trilogy.  When we left the theatre after The Two Towers I felt a little disappointed, while my nephews couldn't wait to see it again.  The difference is I went in with Tolkien blinders, whereas they didn't.  I was anticipating the plot, they were living it.
If you found this movie a disappointment, see it again.  But this time, forget about the book.  Live the plot, scene by scene.  It is a remarkable movie.  The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" has the same shortcoming.  The movie portrayed Nash as a totally different character than the nut he was in real life.  Forgetting the book, it was great movie.
My only disappointment with ""The Two Towers"" was the deleted scenes.  From what I heard there's going to be about 42 minutes of new footage in the special edition DVD.  As with the Fellowship, these deleted scenes filled quite a few gaps, especially for those that read the book.  I would have preferred seeing a longer, complete movie in the theatre than having to wait almost a year later to fill in the pieces.",1060819200,,1728,4.519354838709678
1464414,5,B00005JKZU,"The movie is exceptional. It's scale is mindboggling. The battle of helms deep had me shouting praise for my favorite characters as they chopped down their enemies. The ents attacking Isengard was extraordinarily done. The score is brilliant and I have to say I prefer it to the fellowship soundtrack where the first 6 or 7 songs are all variations of the black riders theme of loud screaming choir. *ug* (Though admittedly the rest is quite good). And as with tFotR, the casting of characters in the Two Towers is right on the mark. My hat is off to Peter Jackson for getting the technical job done right.
I do have a problem with the story changes. There was a reason why Tolkien wrote things the way he did. Changing Faramir's personality to be a power hungry mongrel is not fair. Faramir was a brave and noble fellow and though Peter might redeem him later, Faramir's character is now blemished. Adding elves at helms deep is also a mistake. In Tolkien's story valliant men overcame insurmountable odds and resisted darkness. Now they are weak and need pansy elves to help them. Before men had the power and strength in their own hearts to achieve victory but in this version they don't. In Tolkien's version the ents choose to help fight evil, in this version they decide not to and then get tricked into helping sort of last-minutey. Thus the ents are now brash creatures that respond to events on a moment to moment basis. It's a small part of the story, but it makes the characters less than they are in the novel. Tolkien believed in the character's choice to stand up to evil. Peter Jackson apparently decided that it's more interesting to throw in more struggle. It doesn't hurt the film, but it isn't as true to Tolkien's war of the Ring as it could be. So I think it's up to you to decide how much these changes will impact your overall enjoyment of the film.",1060819200,3,1872,4.541420118343195

I feel the same way about the Two Towers, I loved it in the theater and I can't wait for the extended addition.

1464416,2,B00005JKZU,"To begin, let me say that I have never read a single Lord of the Rings book and therefore have no idea what the original plot of The Two Towers was like. However, I can say that after seeing the film I was disappointed - considering how friends who are Tolkien freaks had told me it was the BEST book in the series. After seeing the first movie (Fellowship of the Ring), I had been impressed and had therefore put some credence in my friends' declarations that the movie would be brilliant. Yet when I finally got to see the film, I felt, if anything, bored and irritated. And my friends, who had been drooling for this film, came out of the cinema feeling very disappointed. According to them, the story and several of the characters had
been appallingly altered. I don't know about any of that, but I do have the following criticisms:
First, the film was too long for its content. The same story could have been told in half the time and might have even been exciting. Instead, it just went on and on and on and on....
Second, there were too many reaction shots. Someone would say something, then the camera would fix on the other person's reaction - at least 12000 times through the film! If they'd cut most of these reaction shots out they'd have probably saved a good half hour of film and it might not have lagged so much.
Third, that Gandalf guy was really likeable in the first film but in this film he became a two dimensional character. Not only that, for some reason he was made into a really powerful magician guy who didn't seem to have any weaknesses at all. I went from liking him in the first film to finding him annoying and wondering why all the other characters kept fawning around him. Also, given the ease with which he and that tiny little army he brought with him at the end of the film destroyed that supposedly invincible Orc army, I was left wondering why he didn't just do that in the first place. Would have saved a lot of time and wouldn't have been as overblown as the ""Gandalf saves the day"" scene was.
Fourth, there was no tension in this film. It was obvious that the good guys were going to win in almost every situation. When that Aragorn guy went over the cliff and fell into the river, I thought it might have been some important plot development (because in this sort of film, someone falling off a cliff into a river is bound to survive). Instead, it was just an incident that was meant to put us on the edge of our seats (if we were 5 years old, say) and also, to waste as much film time as possible. Even the big battle scene was hard to get concerned about because Gandalf had told them that he'd be coming back to save them in a few days.
Fifth, if Christopher Lee's character was such a scary, all-powerful magician (like Super-Gandalf), why did he just stand around looking shocked when those tree monsters attacked his tower? Couldn't he have zapped them or turned them into newts or something?
To sum up, I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film. I guess they ran out of puff after the first one. I hope the third film redeems the series because this one blew.",1060646400,3,3128,4.357876712328767
1464417,5,B00005JKZU,"Personally I think the movies are way better than the books. To be honest, the way Tolkien wrote the books I felt like I was at the dentist having all my teeth pulled. His way of writing reminded me of the only teacher I have ever had who put me to sleep in class. Therefore, I think any departure from the way the books were orginally written is not a bad thing. After all, the first movie had things that were not true to the story as well and yet it was hailed by even the ""purists"" as a wonderful movie. If any of you remember the actual story for the first movie, Arwen actually had a very very small role in the book. Yet in the movie her role is greatly expanded. The council of Elrond was much much longer in the book than in the movies and the part with the Watcher was a much smaller threat in the book than in the movie. So I really think that the deviation from the book in the second movie really benefits the story just as the deviations in the first movie benefitted it.",1060560000,,985,4.082474226804123

Everyone knows that 99.9% of the time the movie is never identical to the book, that is of course unless one lives in a vaccumn? Heck even the famous ""Anne Rice"" was commissioned by the studio who made ""Interview"" to write the screenplay for the movie, and she wasn't a 100% faithful to the book!

The director realized that peoples attention span for movies is not that long, so 3 hours is a stretch.  The bottom line is that changes had to be made, thus the reason they willl have the extended versions, all 2 or 3 of them.  For the average movie person this movie works, it has drama, fighting, great special efffects and a plot that moves along and can be followed.  The book is essentially telling 3 stories at once and when you try to tansfer it to screen that presents a huge challlenge.  The Director did the right thing by changing some stuff or leaving scenes out for the extended versions, otherwise they would never had made a profit from the whole thing.
  If you liked the first one or like the mythology/fantasy style you can not go wrong with this movie, it is a masterpiece even in the theatrical form.

1464611,5,B00005JKZU,"The plot of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels has already proven itself over time - in this trilogy of movies by director Peter Jackson it just needed to be brought successfully to the screen.  The second installment of the series, `The Two Towers', at least equals and perhaps even surpasses `The Fellowship of the Ring.'  The two highlights in my view were firstly the incredible portrayal of Gollum, both his internal turmoil as well as his wretched creature-like body (with the brilliant help of CGI technology); and secondly the epic battle of Helm's Deep that concluded the movie with a cast of thousands.  Unlike the first movie, overall the tone is darker and there is significantly more violence and action, but not with a focus on gory instead of glory.  Thankfully it does not degenerate to the distasteful gore and gratuitous bloody violence that marks much contemporary action movies.  Other memorable aspects were the majestic New Zealand scenery, and the portrayal of an overwhelming sense of evil in connection with the forces of Sauron and Saruman.

It is only to be expected that some changes need to be made to the plot in order to condense an epic story into just three hours.  However I was disappointed that unlike the first movie, Jackson appears to have made some adjustments to Tolkien's original that were simply unnecessary and unjustifiable, particularly the antagonism of Faramir, the portrayal of the Ents, as well as the incorporation of some extra drama involving Aragorn at the end of a battle, and the infusion of too much romance not present in the original.  You don't need to be a Tolkien purist to find these kind of unnecessary changes somewhat annoying.

But once one gets over the initial shock of the adjustments to Tolkien, this is still a brilliant movie.  The setting of Middle Earth, along with its characters and epic war really comes alive.  This may be fantasy, but the choices and struggles are very human and very real.  Perhaps this is most obvious with Sam's wise words at the end: ""There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.""  This is as true for real life as it is for Tolkien's world.  It's also true of the movie itself: in a world of cinematic garbage, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings show that there is still some good left in this world, and these are movies worth fighting for. -GODLY GADFLY",1060041600,37,2374,4.772616136919315

I feel that it would be wrong to judge the movie against the book at this time, because quite a bit of the book has yet to take place until the third movie. However, as far as writing goes, I can understand Faramir, and Eomer acting like jerks, because frankly, that's what the writers have been doing the whole time. Elrond, Galadriel, Theoden, everyone's usual politeness has been filed down to cause so conflict between the heroes and the helpers. Even Gollum's schizo-scene, comic at first, has found a soft spot in my heart (Has no one else pitied him? ""I hate you. I hate you"").

Yes, yes, yes, we all know it's nearly impossible to translate such an honored work of literature to the the big screen. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" part one of this epic story. He dropped the ball big time with this adaptation of part two.
Completely unnecessary scenes steal precious screen time from scenes that are actually important, thus watering down this pivotal story. Aragorn going over the cliff? What a waste of ten minutes. Aside from the fact that the scene is not in the book (an entirely different subject for discussion!), it's horribly cheesy and not even remotely interesting or very well done. (Oh, Aragorn is swept away by the river! Will he survive? Gee, I wonder....)
Faramir's character (for those who know the books) is not only off, but the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of how he's supposed to be. Instead of something of an ""Aragorn Lite"" - a brave, wise warrior who resists temptation, he's played as ""Boromir Lite"" - a boorish, headstrong, weak fool who, in another example of ten wasted minutes of film time, unnecessarily brings Frodo and Sam along with him instead of letting them continue their quest, which Faramir knows is vital. This sets up a completely unbelievable scene (even for a fantasy movie) involving a Nazgul mere feet from the One Ring. Puh-lease.
These two useless scenes alone could've allowed Jackson to actually finish the movie, instead of simply stopping it as though he were running out of time. And honestly, how could you ask for a better cliffhanger ending than that in the book? One of the storylines comes to something of a resolution, while the other leaves off in the mother of all cliffhangers. As it is, the movie hardly feels complete when the end credits begin to roll. I left the theater in a baaaad mood after this one.
It's not all bad! As mentioned at the beginning of this review the actors are excellent, the scenery is beautiful, and the direction is quite good. The battle scenes are nothing short of breathtaking (though the ""Olympic torch"" guy stretched even MY ability to suspend disbelief). A more comprehensible story and an actual ending sure would've been nice, though. If you're just up for a cool-looking, well-acted movie, and if you don't know the books, ""The Two Towers"" may be for you. If you love the novels, however, and are looking for an adaptation as good as the first part of this movie trilogy, you'll be disappointed.",1059868800,13,2530,4.858796296296297
1464617,5,B00005JKZU,"Having already reviewed the August release of the theatrical version, I still felt compelled to weigh in on the Special Extended Edition, which will likely be much more of a complete version of the Two Towers. This is epic filmmaking at it's best. Peter Jackson has tapped a veritable fountain of creative juices, and he weaves a tapestry of sorrow, joy, and terror like no other director in the history of modern cinema. The Two Towers is the penultimate adventure film; a treatise on war, an examination of genocide, and a heart-wrenching look into the schisms of greed, and ultimate power. Many who see this film will look past the tortured ramblings of Gollum as nothing more than a gimmick, a minute-to-minute laugh track from a loose-cannon gladhand. But those that take a second to delve beneath the cowl of Gollum's apparent insanity will find a depth of character that is as of yet unmatched in the fantasy genre. Many who see this film will balk at the elves heroic arrival to the gates of Helm's Deep. A story driven on emotion at times requires such artistic license, and this alteration worked for this viewer. With no change in the outcome of the ""victory"" by the embattled warriors of Rohan, the elves played only to enhance an already emotionally exhausting and kinetically exciting battle for surivival. The performances were astonishing, from Aragorn's noble and heroic warrior-to-be King, to Gimli's soft-hearted and motherly banter, the cast has pulled of a feat rarely accomplished: Total Cinematic Synergy. From the music to the costume design, from the breathtaking cinematography to the painstaking editing, The Two Towers is a triumph. Relish the time we have spent in Peter Jackson's wonderfully imagined Middle Earth. Embrace this vision, for it is one that is singular in the art of filmmaking.

Is this the The Two Towers that made J.R.R. Tolkien one of the  ten best selling authors of the entire 1970's?  Is this The Two  Towers that forced a generation of gritics to admit that, yes, a  book could be quality literature and entertaining at the same  time?  Is this The Two Towers sprung from the literary genius  of Tolkien, whose towering imagination was fed by all that has  been good in Western civilization, from Beowulf to the Bible to  the heroism of Britain and the Allies in World War II?
Answers: A) No.  B) No.  C) No.
Peter Jackson is pretty much doing for Tolkien's The Lord of  the Rings what Sherman did for the South.  He continues his  ravaging of this milestone of human imagination, begun in  LOTR 1 The Fellowship of the Ring, in his second installment  The Two Towers.
A lot of folks over the years have been telling us that artistic  inspiration and ... just simply don't mix.  If there was ever any doubt, The Two Towers sweeps it away in a flood of aesthetically senseless plot tinkerings that serve only to give Liv Tyler some much-coveted face time that Tolkien's story wouldn't have given her.  Aragorn is given a dream sequence  with Liv that makes him look like he isn't man enough to sit on  the throne in his own bathroom, let alone the throne of Gondor.  And then the poor guy has to go wounded and MIA so that Liv can come to his side and kiss the boo-boos and make them better in an out-of-body experience sort of way. [...]  Tolkien's mighty  tree-folk come out looking like they are made of balsa wood.  But [Dominic] Monaghan gets to deliver a sermon on inter-species unity  that would have done Captain Kirk proud.
Jackson expands on his portrait of Saruman as polluter  extraordinaire.  The White Wizard watches his his orcs tear  down oak trees and gleefully exclaims, ""Living things will fall to the forges of industry!""  Geez, we don't need Gandalf here.  We need Ted Turner's ""Captain Planet""!
One thing The Two Towers has done for me is help me better appreciate the subtlety in Tolkien's masterpiece.  Jackson's comparative clumsiness most strongly shows itself in his treatment of Gollum.  Tolkien's Gollum was sort of an Everyman with a penchant for super-fresh sushi.  Tolkien was able to evoke simultaneously both Frodo's pity for the poor creature and Sam's disgust at the twisted little vermin.  I don't know if any movie crew could transfer this dialectic to the silver screen, but Jackson apparently didn't even think it worth trying.  Seizing on the proclivity Tolkien gave Gollum for talking to himself, Jackson decides Gollum is a victim of -- ... -- Multiple Personality Disorder courtesy the Power of the Ring.  This is a terribly important misstep, because fundamental to Tolkien's story is the idea that the Ring has power over men, hobbits, whoever, only to the extent that it can call out to the greed, power lust, fear, or whatever that is already inside them. Tolkien's Gollum is a magnification of the human condition. Jackson's Gollum just needs a good dose of prozac.
There were more than a couple of places where Jackson could  have avoided overkill just by MAKING THE CONFOUNDED MOVIE THE WAY TOLKIEN WROTE IT!!!  Jackson's most egregious transgression here comes when Nameless Character A (avoiding a spoiler here) has come under Saruman's influence and Nameless Character B is going to set things straight.  In Tolkien's book, Character B fixes the problem by essentially taking Character A out to the woodshed.  But no, that's not good enough for Jackson.  He has decided that what Tolkien should have done was give us a full-fledged exorcism. ""Come out of him, Saruman!""  ""If I go, he dies!""  ""You will not hurt him and you will not hurt me!  Come out!""  ""Gyaaahhhh!"" Why didn't Jackson just finish the job and put in a couple of head spins and a gallon of green lost lunch?
Other ""improvements"" include Orcs riding big, nasty warf rats.  And Elf Legolas shooting arrows as he SKATEBOARDS DOWN A STAIRWAY!!!  It's the stuff that the D&Ders want to see, but it rips the ozone layer away from the atmosphere that Tolkien created.
Why, oh why, does Peter Jackson need to ""improve"" on Tolkien?  Look Pete, on the one hand we have you: capable director. On the other hand, we have J.R.R.: out-and-out literary genius.  Capable.  Genius.  Capable. Genius. Which one of the two of you should be improving on the other?
There are alot of fantasy fans who will love this movie and will think I am crazy for being so derogatory.  I'll try to explain myself: Think about it, folks. The Lord of the Rings is still going strong after pert near fifty years.  How much thought have you given to any of the fantasy serials that you were reading just three years ago?  Doesn't that make you think that there was maybe some ""magick"" in it that your other little entertainments just don't have?  In The Lord of the Rings you have yourself a bag full of diamonds.

1464684,5,B00005JKZU,"Yes, I'll buy this DVD on August 26th. When November arrives, I'll buy the extended version. I'll see Return of the King on December 17th. I've seen the Two Towers four or five times in the theaters, the same for Fellowship of the Ring.
And yes I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy many times, since first reading it in the 1970's. Everyone in my family has read the trilogy except my 8 year old.
And no, I'm not a purist. And no, I'm not complaining about what Peter Jackson--the director--did or didn't do in the making of this film. I'm simply glad that he did. I never thought that in my lifetime (past 50), I'd live to see Lord of the Rings brought to film in a way that would do it justice.
I figured at best another animated movie. Or someone would try to cram the whole trilogy in one film, or at most two films, leaving out half the story. Or they'd film part of the story, then IF it was successful, film another part, a la Star Wars (meaning the characters would either age or be replaced as the tale unfolded--a bit disconcerting when the entire tale is told and watched consecutively at home on DVD later).
Do I need to tell you about this DVD? If you haven't seen Fellowship of the Ring, rent or buy that first, because the Two Towers is the middle book of Tolkien's  story (voted best literary accomplishment of the 20th century) and therefore has no real beginning or end, the story concluding with the Dec 17th release of the movie Return of the King.
What you will see is an epic story, with epic battles, fought in a glorious land (filmed in New Zealand and each frame digitally enhanced), with characters and peoples with a rich culture and history. Part of Tolkien's genius was that he created separate languages, alphabets, architectures and cultures for elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs and so forth. And director Peter Jackson's attention to the detail is such, that you sense and see rich history and culture behind every character and scene you see.
At times it's overwhelming.
I don't think you can say this movie is better or worse than the first in the trilogy, Fellowship of the Ring. I personally liked the Fellowship slightly better (a bit more pastoral and musical), my teenagers liked the Two Towers slightly better (a bit more action and a grander scale). In any event, it's all part of the same story, and by August of 2004 both you and I will finally be able to sit down and watch the entire epic unfold on DVD all at one time.",1059523200,3,2469,4.450331125827814
1464685,5,B00005JKZU,"When I went to see this movie, I was skeptical, being not a big fan of the first Lord of the Rings installment and never having read the books, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually, that's an understatement.  I was blown away by the action, the acting, and most of all, the amount of effort everyone working on the movie had put into it.  The battle of Helms Deep is spectacular, the cast is great (especially the intensely sexy Viggo Mortensen), but the animation is amazing.  Gollum is just wonderful, he's my favourite character, and the ents are quite good.  I can't say enough complimentary things about this movie, it's just something you have to see for yourself.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see something mind-blowingly exciting but not too intense.",1059523200,,786,4.785185185185185
1464686,2,B00005JKZU,"Three books were given to Peter Jackson under good intentions
Seven months was all he needed
Nine hours to watch
But we were all of us deceived
In the hills of New Zealand
In the wetter studios
The dark lord Jackson
Made in secret a different film
Filled with his variation and greed
Ok so maybe I'm being a bit melodramatic but I think I have good right. I for one choose to read the books before I turned 18, and so I did. I even tried my hand at the Silmarillion (shudders). Ok so lets begin, the fellowship of the ring was released with great anticipation and I felt although a few things could have been different it was a good film and stayed at least close to the values of the book. The Two towers is different, very different. The greatest saving grace of the fellowship was Sean Beans fantastic portrayal of Boromir but of course he died, things did not look good.
 The opening almost saved the film as Gandalf slaying the Balrog was awesome but unfortunately it slowly dissolved into drivel, from the mysterious warg riders and Aragorns little swim which seems to have been added only to introduce a pitiful cameo by Arwen and it continues. I seem to recall the directors explaining things like Tom Bombadill was taken out of the first film due to time restrictions....so why have they added these parts in. Helms deep was little more than an outpost defended by approximately one hundred men the rest were killed by the wargs (shudders again oh and no women of course, they cant fight) I almost thought the film could have been saved by the appearance of the massed armies but the massively hyped massive engine was not really that impressive. Although I must admit that Gollum was well done, of cause the fact that the deep and ultimately valiant battle between Smeagol and Gollum turned into a joke session.
Faramir? Why, why did they do that. I seem to recall he wasn't the embodiment of evil but hey what do I know.
I could go into final thoughts but there is more, Gimly has taken on sort of Jar-Jar Binks character and is the subject of many short jokes. Although it seams that Legolas could take on the entire horde of Morgoth single handily. In one word - Hollywoodised. The tears began to fall when the elves turned up for no real reason other than the elves by nature are impressive.
There I think I will stop, as I cannot bear to think about this atrocity any longer. At least the Fellowship was a good film,  if you had read the books or not, I don't believe this one was. Ah well we can wait with baited breath for the Return of the King and the return of scathing reports.
Only three things gave this film life in my eyes and that is why it gained two stars, firstly the opening, just like the opening of the fellowship it was grand and exhilarating this goes for the Ent fight also. Two - Haldir, fantastic at least Jackson is getting his death scenes. Three, wurmtounge what can I say the casting guys did get it right some times.

1464738,4,B00005JKZU,"I have read all of the books and agree there are little changes here and there between the books and the movies.  The books have become a basis for the story line and any deviation from the story line can alter what Tolkien's intents were.  (You can see this from all of the prints that had to be done, as the publishers kept making their own changes.)
Though where I stand on the art of filmmaking versus the accuracy of the adaptation of the books is a middle road.  The book is a tool for the imagination where as a movie is used to intrigue the audience and to stimulate visually.  It is obvious that the movies are a big hit.  I've seen in the theater - The Two Towers six times and The Lord of the Ring nine times and everytime it is a thrill because you just can't find a story line as brilliant as this or an adaptation as splendid.
Most changes were subtle and threw in an interesting twist that was unexpected for anyone who knows the books.  This is nice to watch the unexpected.  I only have one gripe about the changes made and this is the portrayal of Faramir and the relationship established with Frodo.  You do not see the wit and strength that each character has within. Granted in a three hour movie it is hard to portray this idea, but less addition of material would have ment a more accurate account of Tolkien's story.  As I said before, it is not done in poor favor.
However, we are now talking about an adaptation which then becomes Jackson's account of his ideas and his visions from when he read the books.  I admit, I fancy his views and don't think I could have came up with such intricate details.  I had the basics from the book, but he brought it to life and made you love the characters even more so by showing the the emotional involvement, humor, and the personalities of each individual.  The cast also had a hand in this, and is fabulous in their own right using their own ideas of what they thought the characters would do and how they would look in certain situations.  This is the art of adaptation and splendor of filmmaking.
Do not be swayed by the changes that have been made, but accept both the book and the movie for what they are - works of art in which each person takes with them their own interpretations and opinions.  You do not have to feel the same way as I do or as anyone else does. Summing up this review I would say enjoy it for what it is - entertainment and an escape from life as we know it for three hours.

1464739,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson's(director) latest installment in the blockbust lord of the rings series ""The Two Towers"" is an incredible sequel to an amazing movie. Rarely does a sequel surpass the original, but this movie certainly does. The movie transitions seamlessly from the first, following frodo and sam in the mountains where they meet up with gollum, who serves as their guide on their journey to morodor. Incredible animation brings gollum to life, at first I was amazed at what a great job the animators did with gollum, but by the end of the movie, I saw him as just another character, I had forgotten he was computer animated.
  For those that have read the book, this movie may prove to stretch a tad further from jrr tolkiens writings than the first, but it is enjoyable none the less. With the introduction of many new characters and creatures, Jackson's crew seems to hit the nail on the head with each actor/animation. The infamous ents are incredibly well done, and as the march of the ents begins, the viewer will most certainly get a rush of adrenaline, as the readers do when tolkien described it. The greatest scene in this movie is by far the battle of Helm's deep.
  You must get this movie, if you like the first movie, youll love this one, and its guaranteed to leave you lusting for the third film, which hits theaters this december, and let me tell you, im counting the days, and so will you.",1059350400,,1406,4.612
1464800,4,B00005JKZU,"First of all, I take my hat off to Peter Jackson and his production crews for an excellent job on bringing Tolkien's tales to the screen.  The two so far are eminently watchable and largely true to the original in spirit (though not always in story).
Having said that, I would like to reply to those who vehemently deplore the Tolkien ""purists"" (as if they had AIDS). Jackson does follow the essentials of the LOTR quite well throughout, but there are, as we know, places where he diverges, sometimes considerably, from the books.
These fall into two categories: (1) those that do not affect the important aspects of the story or characters and (2) those that do.  Due to the constraints of film, some changes/edits are inevitable.  Where they fall under type (1), there is no problem and a Tolkien fan who objects vociferously about those is being excessively critical. But those of the second type are a problem, in my view.
Examples of the first type are Tom Bombadil and Arwen taking Frodo to the ford.  Tom Bombadil is colorful and fun, but not necessary to the story, hence, the change is acceptable.  Glorfindel, who meets Aragorn and the hobbits above the ford, is not in any way important to the story, so if Jackson substitutes Arwen to create a love interest and have an exciting horse race (not in the original), then that's just fine.
In other areas, however, I was disappointed in Jackson because the changes were not necessary and could have been handled differently.  This is most apparent in the Two Towers. For example, the handling of Faramir, whom we are made to think covets the ring for Gondor. This is patently not true in the book.  In fact, it is critical that he does NOT want it and suspects the ruin it would bring to those who tried to wield it. It is he, knowing Boromir better than any, that understand Boromir would have been tempted and guesses that he tried to take it from Frodo.  He does not wait for Sam to make an emotional outburst speech.  The point is that men are seen as weak and capable of corruption by all the Old World beings such as the elves and Faramir gives a prime example that some Men (including Aragorn) are not so susceptible and that there is hope for humankind when the elves leave Middle Earth. Jackson completely throws this away just to put in some blitzy battle scenes.  Brining Frodo, Sam and Gollum back to Osgiliath adds nothing and takes away valuable time from the film that would have been better spent on more character development and interaction, something that is often overlooked in favor of special effects and action.
Also, Frodo and Sam's interaction with Gollum are sometimes distorted unnecessarily in a way that lessens the story.  Gollum does not attack them at their first meeting, instead it is the hobbits who capture him and it is Frodo's idea, not Gollum's, to make Gollum swear by the ring and to control him with it.  The depth of Frodo's wisdom, though recently naive, is lost in these exchanges.  In addition, Gollum's upcoming betrayal is seen as more a reaction to bad treatment by hobbits rather than the constant corrosive pull of the ring.  Jackson keeps this idea, too, but overplays the other for some Hollywood drama. These are small points but they add up and the constraints of making a film are not an excuse.
Overall, the LOTR movies are excellent and we should be grateful for them.  I only wish that Jackson had avoided the Hollywood temptations in places (these were not distortions required by filmmaking), then he would have made perfect films.  And it's a shame because some of them were not necessary and the films could have been kept interesting while staying closer to the original. However, I could also point out numerous examples where, although altering the story/landscape/dialogue somewhat, Jackson stays true to the tale. The bottom line is that he makes good movies that reflect the original fairly closely.
If you love the LOTR, get the films and enjoy them as movies. If you want the full story, get the books and read them (does anyone read any more?).",1059004800,7,4074,4.692847124824684

1464802,5,B00005JKZU,"I am a long-term lover of the Professors marvelous creation. That is if he indeed create it-it may have always been there and he only the discoverer.  I have been reading the Work at least once through every couple of years since the early 70's!  If Middle Earth was a real place I'd pack my bags and move there with stopover in OZ along the way!  The Work is a nearly perfect fantasy!
I too was originally bothered by the changes in the story of the Two Towers.  Boromir and Faramir are black and white good and bad. Peter Jackson just made Faramir a little gray!
I believe the issue that Jackson wanted to magnify with this change was who VOLUNTARILY gives up the ring.  SPOILER! SPOILER! There are only two people in the entire story who has touched the ring who does this and that is Bilbo and Sam!  There are several rather important people into whos grasps the ring comes.  Gandalf, Elrond, Galadreal and Faramir are ultimately are not caught by the ring and Boromir was caught!  If the ring gets to Minis Tirith all is lost!  Sauron will prevail and his greatest spoil will be the ring.  The ring knows this and it is constantly trying to get there!  Jackson is, I believe, trying to emphasize this.  Even if the Nazgul saw Frodo in Osgilith he will just assume that all is well and the ring is indeed in Minis Tirith with those silly weak men!
I believe that he could have kept our favorite son as snowy white but in terms of the movie he wouldn't have been quite as interesting.  This does not affect the overall story or intent. Most importantly Faramir refuses the temptation and lets Frodo and Sam go!
The Ent storyline seemed strangely truncated.  I believe that much of the new footage in the extended version will fix much of that!
On the positive side-for the first time we have a living, breathing Gollum!  Practically as real as a heart attack!  The team, including Andy Serkis, should have been given a special academy award for an outstanding achievement.  Thankfully there is always the last movie!
Both movies have been more faithful to the book than it ever wood have been if it had been hacked up by Hollywood!  Chris Rock would have ended up as Gollum and it would all have taken place on the streets of Beverly Hills and be about an hour and a half long!
And if the finally to this thing lives up to the first two movies we have quite a treat in store!

1464844,5,B00005JKZU,"Frankly, I'm a bit aggravated with the multitude of reveiw's that are not at all reviews of the fime, but complaint filled diatribes on why it is bad compared to the book. Here's the long and the short of it, many people's have alot of the same complaints, so I'll address the most commone ones. The first major complaint one often hears is, why is it Elves that arrive at Helm's Deep, when it doesn't happen like that in the book. The answer is simple, in the book, it is the Dunedain that arrive to aid Rohan, however in order for that to have had any meaning to anyone who saw the movie that is not well read in Tolkien, Mr. Jackson would have to have added about 30 minutes of additional film in either Fellowship or Two Towers in order to explain to the general audience who the Dunedain were. The important thing is that the help came at the behest of Elrond, which Haldir says to Theoden as he arrives.
  Second big complaint, Gimli was too much of a comic character. This one is mostly directed at AD&D people who think that because in their D&D world dwarfs are tough and humorless and dry means that that is how Tolkien's Dwarves should be. I ask all of those people to remember the Demeanor of the Dwarves in The Hobbitt. The very first thing they do is sing some VERY comical verses at Bilbo's expense. As far as Gimli's seeming comic nature in Two Towers, realize that his sarcasm which makes some people laugh is often what insults others, for example the incident with Eomer and the Rohirrim when they first meet.
  Next big complaint, They made the Ents seem Stupid. No, they didn't. Speaking slowly, and being slow are two different things, and Treebeard points out, that things take a long time to say in Entish.
  SO, what's up with the kill tally that Gimli and Legolas had? Go back and Read that portion of the book, it is in there.
  Last, the one that bugs me the most that people complain about is Faramir. Why does Farmir act exactly like Boromir? He doesn't, ever, at all. Faramir is not tempted by the ring, he is misguided in what the ring can do, so he takes frodo to Gondor, Just like he does in the book, then lets Frodo go, Just like in the book. The slight shift in character can be easily explained from a position of how important certain character's character arcs are. Faramir's is relativly low, Aragorn's is High, if Faramir exhibits the same amount of nobility and resistance to the ring, then how special would Aragorn's personality remain?
  I hope this puts some clarity into why things were done the way they were, speaking as someone who has studied screenwriting and film, I can say that the script was adapted in the only way possible in order to make these films a body of work that couls be financially justified as a box office production. Recognize that Jackson could have put every minute detail, reference, and unimportant character in the film, but then it would have been a TV miniseries, with effects more akin to his Dead Alive, or Meet The Feebles films, as opposed to the Brilliant Cast, Effects, and Locations that actually created Middle Earth and this brilliant series of films.",1058832000,4,3140,4.502636203866432
1464845,1,B00005JKZU,"In the fellowship, when PJ and co. changed things to be different from the way that tolkien wrote the story and least it made sense in the context of the movie.  In the two towers, all of the deviations from the book are not only stupid, but pointless.  From the Aaragorn fighting with wargs and falling off cliffs to the ents, the oldest and wisest race in middle earth getting outsmarted and going way out of character by making a decision and changing their minds to the rediculous comic relief of Gimli (and I'm not even mentioning how they butcher faramir), these changes only served to hurt the story.  Even when they follow along with the storyline, all of tolkiens magic is ripped away but the complete lack of subtlety.  Theoden wasn't possesed by saruman and by making him so it robbed so much from what is otherwise a beautiful story.  I'm sorry but after the amazing job they did on the fellowship, I can't help but be enormously dissapointed with the hollywood ... that I saw in the two towers and surprised by how many people think that this is actually a good movie!
It's sad how easy it is for hollywood to rob people of artistic integrity for the sake of maximizing profits (it's like George Lucas and Peter Jackson got together to write Gimli and Jar Jar's characters at the same time)",1058745600,11,1303,4.527659574468085
1464846,5,B00005JKZU,"The second installment of Tolkiens classic trilogy is brought to magnificent life in this, Peter Jackson's forray into the world of Middle Earth.  It's worth remembering that this is an ADAPTATION of Tolkiens work, and fans of the book will be quick to spot some key differences...most notably the ending, with postpones Sam and Frodo's arachnophobic encounters until the third movie.  While book-spods will probably baulk at the various changes they might at least concede the necessity of modifying the film for the screen.
The Two Towers marks the commencement of open battle between the shattered alliance of elves and men, and the dark forces of Saruman and Sauron, the former played to corrupt perfection by the indomitable Christopher Lee.  The army of Orthanc, portrayed in clanking, snarling digital splendor, marches against the rag-tag human army, fleeing to apparant safety at Helm's Deep, an ancient stronghold.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam stumble painfully towards Mordor, helped and hindered by One-ring obsessed Gollum, voiced by Andy Sirkis and realised in more CG perfection.  In the third strand of the story Merry and Pippin, in the clutches of Saruman's Uruk scouts, find themselves alone in the Fanghorn forest, with some unlikely allies.
This is an absolutely massive story, compressed artfully into an equally epic movie.  Yes, there's been some snips, cuts, changes and adaptations made, but at the end of the day this is still a worthy homage to Tolkiens vision, and a damn fine adventure.  The cast list glitters and shines with quality actors...Elijah Wood continues to impress as the wide-eyed Frodo; grizzly Viggo Mortensen is dashing and soulful as Aragorn, with eagle-eyed Orlando Bloom and sturdy John-Ryhs Davies in fine supporting roles.  The list goes on and on, much as it did for Fellowship Of the Ring.
With plenty of wonderful special effects, a gripping score and many hours of fantastic special features, this DVD will one day be hailed as a third of the greatest movie of all time.  Highly recommended.",1058745600,3,2042,5.145015105740181
1464847,5,B00005JKZU,"OK, after reading through some of these reviews, I can't but help notice all the references to the point that having Elves at Helms Deep was not accurate to the book.  To this I say, ""So what?""  Why?  I'll tell you why.
But first I'll preface this by saying that I'm not an artsy fartsy film critic by any means, but if any of these reviewers had listened to the Director's/Writer's commentary on the Extended Edition of FELLOWSHIP, they would have learned that some things have to changed, added, or even deleted in order to make a compelling film.  And not only a compelling film, but one that moves along.  By that I mean, several events characters were changed in personality and timings in order to get the most ""umphh"" within the alotted run time.
Secondly, many if not all of the added scenes in the Extended Edition were originally cut due to flow reasons, even though some were very important to the overall LOTR trilogy storyline.  So the changes in TWO TOWERS that everyone is complaining about were probably made in order to give the same feeling or point, that probably couldn't otherwise be filmed.  The big change of Elves at Helms Deep can and wil probably be logically explained in the commentary on the TTT-EE DVD.
Now I also thought that TTT felt rushed in its theatrical release, so I'm really hopeful that these 43 additional minutes will add or even correct a few of the changes to the overall flow and story of TTT.  However, one should also poing out that the abrupt ending of TTT was intended mainly due to running time.  The events that supposedly fill out the end of the book will be the first events in ROTK.  Look for the EE of the ROTK DVD to feature nearly an hour of additional scenes.",1058572800,,1717,4.509677419354839
1464908,4,B00005JKZU,"This was a great, seamless follow-up to Fellowship.  While I have read LoTR yearly for the last forty years, I do have a realistic concept of what it took to put such a HUGE classic on screen.  Leaving out less important parts is necessary to plot movement, BUT why add something that never happened and detract from the strength of one of the better characters.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum were never taken to Osgiliath by Faramir.  Indeed, Faramir resisted any control of the Ringbearer and party because he knew neither he nor his father could be trusted with an item of such immense power. Other than that jarring note, the movie was incredible.",1058486400,,644,4.672566371681416
1464909,5,B00005JKZU,"Does this movie live up to the standard set by ""Fellowship of the Ring?""  Answer: Yes and no.
YES, IT DOES because it was made with the same precision, quality, and attention to detail as its predecessor.  As was done with ""Fellowship,"" Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's Middle Earth to life with unprecedented realism.  The CGI is, if anything, even more fluid and transparent to the viewer than the first film (The Matrix folks should be taking notes).  Continuing the trend from the extended version of the first movie, this edition seamlessly integrates footage that was not included with the original movie release, adding important detail and minor plot points previously shorn only for brevity (the Harry Potter DVD folks should be taking notes, too).  The added scenes in ""Fellowship"" extrapolated upon and added to the flavor of that film in ways that made watching it seem like seeing a whole new movie.  Expect the same result with ""Two Towers"": a visual masterpiece that absorbs you into the story even more fully than before.
NO, IT DOES NOT for a number of reasons: This movie does not raise the bar from what was accomplished with ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""  In that regard, it probably deserves more like 4.9 stars.  Another reviewer likened this installment to ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.""  I cannot improve upon that assessment.  The story is still excellent, but the the people, places, and, consequently, the overall mood of the movie, are much darker.  Frodo, for one, is much more grim and moody, reflecting the baleful influence of the Ring upon him.  Since the characters have been established from the first movie, character depth now gives way somewhat to the storyline.  For instance, Pippen and Merry are notably only bit players in this film and have little to say, making them far less entertaining than they appeared in the first film.  With any luck, the added/extended material should improve this lapse.
It should also be noted that the movie's attention to detail refers to VISUAL detail -- if you are a book purist who is bothered by minor departures from the story as Tolkien wrote it, this movie is not for you.  Expect minor alterations akin to those exhibited in ""Fellowship"" and more of them.  Overall, the story remains the same.  It's still a must-see, just don't expect the book.

1464911,5,B00005JKZU,"I see a lot of people have touched on the changes that were made in the movie so I will manage to make this review fairly short. I loved the books, they were quite possibly some of the most interesting and incredible books I've read to date, and so far I think Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job with them. When reading the books i knew Two Towers would be the hardest to create on film. Some of the Ent stuff was a bit iffy, but I was able deal with that. My biggest two complaints were those of Arwen and Faramir. They spent altogether probably 45 minutes on the two, and let me say it completely changes some of the images that I think Tolkien wanted set. The Arwen stuff was[bad]. Yes, I understand Liv Tyler is beautiful, trust me. Yes I understand they want to build a love story, but please don't waste so much time on it. Faramir was supposed to be the opposite of Boromir. He was supposed to be a hero and lived on his principles and very forgiving. The whole thing about going wherever they went was another huge waste of time. With that time they definitely could have given the Ents a much bigger part, or perhaps stayed to the story line with Frodo and his crew.
But, now that i have complained, I am just going to say that the movie as a whole is absolutely awesome. I think the elves coming to help was sweet (but could have been sweeter in the next movie) and Helm's Deep was awesome. Great movie.",1058313600,,1417,4.232472324723247

1464973,5,B00005JKZU,"If Peter Jackson had tried to set the events leading up to RoTK any better he would not have succeeded. As sequels go, The Two Towers, save The Empire Strikes Back, is the finest example of ""follow me I have something incredible to show you"" filmaking I have ever seen. While much darker and more violent than FoTR, The Two Towers still carries great emotional weight, and stuns the viewer with intricate battle sequences interspersed with genuinely heart-felt and touching moments. Everything about this film screams quality. The performances are outstanding, and with the addition of Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill, the Middle Earth family is complete. The opening sequence is breathtaking. The battle for Helm's Deep is absolutely astonishing (eventhough the purists rail at the idea of Haldir coming to the rescue). The Ents march on Isengard is something that will be remembered for years to come. The mounting tension as Frodo and Sam race to destroy the ring grows with each passing second. Frodo's inner turmoil is superbly protrayed by the more than capable Elijah Wood. Aragorn is becoming King, with each passing second, and Peter Jackson is sharp enough to make it hard to notice. Everything about this movie just feels right. But Gollum steals the show. Andy Serkis is incredible, and he breathes so much life into the CG character that you quickly forget that Gollum is not actually a real person. All in all The Two Towers surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring, in almost every aspect. This viewer cannot fathom the wonders that Peter Jackson has in store us in The Return of the King. HIGHLY recommended.",1058227200,,1618,4.930402930402931
1464974,5,B00005JKZU,"This film does live up to the expectations I had of it. I knew that I could not expect every little detail from the book, and that this film, just like the Fellowship of the Ring, would become an instant favorite of mine. There are points in the film that I frowned at, such as the scene with Aragorn falling over the cliff, but I know that changes had to be made to adapt such a long book into a film. I also understand the fact that this movie as well as the other two have been and will be made for the masses, not just for us Tolkien enthusiasts. You can't expect everything from the book, Peter Jackson gave this film his maximum effort, I'm sure. And when such a page-to-film adaptation occurs, I know that dropping things from the original text has to be hard, but it is how things work. As for effects and the filming itself, It is superb. The landscapes and beauty of New Zealand jump from the screen, and describe Tolkien's world of Middle-earth as good as his linguistics allow. No better could they have done for this film, then they did, and I expect an even better film for The Return of the King. I recommend this book, film, and any other Tolkien-related item to anyone who has the time enough to learn and love his beloved Middle-earth. To close, I would like to add that Tolkien himself is the greatest author of all time, and anyone who says otherwise is either wrong, or nearly right.",1058227200,,1404,4.342205323193916

OK, I have given this film 5 stars. Why? Is it the best film ever? Probably not. Is it flawed? There are a few flaws here and there (as in every film - look at the number of flubs in Jurassic Park...) but they do not really distract from the whole experience. I have given this flick 5 stars because I was thoroughly thrilled by it, from the riveting beginning to the cliffhanging end. Loosen up, people! After all, it is only an interpretation of a fantasy novel. There is nothing sacred to Tolkien's texts, it is only a fantasy. And a very good one at that. I have read it many, many times in a couple of languages. I am sure this qualifies me as a geek, but I still think that Peter Jackson and his crew have done a more than commendable job, to put it mildly. Especially the second tome is a nightmare to adapt into a screenplay and a watchable movie. This movie is more than watchable, it is an action packed fantasy that is simply a marvel to behold. The production is so richly detailed that there is always something new to see.
Sure, there are deviations from the original story, but all in all I think Peter Jackson c.s. have done their utmost to respect the spirit and feel of Tolkien's works. I will certainly buy both the theatrical and the extended edition, and I have high hopes for a super-duper edition where every film lasts six hours or more.
Well done, you wizards in New Zealand! Should you ever come across these humble lines: It has been a joy so far, and I am looking forward to the next and, sadly, last film.
Personal note to Mr. Peter Jackson: If anybody can do 'The Hobbit', it is you. Please think about it.
Cheers!",1058227200,,1649,4.305466237942122
1464976,5,B00005JKZU,"Before these films were released, I thought perhaps I was a ""purist"", but now I realize I am not after all.
I have read the Lord of the Rings books many, many times--the first time being over 30 years ago.  I loved them then, and I love them today.
But the films are not the books.  That does not lessen my enthusiasm for either.
As other reviewers have said--it's not possible in 9 hours to capture the complexity of the Rings trilogy.  I was initially distressed at the change that placed the elves at Helm's Deep, but considering that in the books the struggle of the elves and dwarves [and Men] within their own lands was barely a footnote, I suppose that the screenwriter wished to show that they were not really on the sidelines and the most expedient way to include them and to illustrate that was to have Elves march to the aid of the members of the Company.
[NOTE: for those who may have forgotten--silmultaneous with the battles and conflicts in the South which involved the Company {which Tolkien chose to describe in detail in these books}, the Dwarves and Lake Men in the North were also fighting for their lives and lands against hordes of orcs and goblins--as well as Legolas' father and their people in Mirkwood--AND the Elves of Lothlorien.  In the books, the elves were not able to send help because they were besieged and I disagree with the reviewer who believed that Tolkien intended the reader to think that the elves chose to remain on the sidelines and let the chips fall where they may.]
Anyway, as for the changes--it is sometimes nice to have a surprise or two and not have every aspect of the plot memorized before hand.
I sincerely believe the Two Towers beautifully follows the Fellowship and I don't think that even ""purists"" could possibly craft a more compelling adaptation, or create a more enchanting set, or cast more empathetic actors.
The films are magnificent.  In their own right.",1058140800,,1920,4.635294117647059
1464977,5,B00005JKZU,"Having just seen The Two Towers for a third time, I know that is one of the best of 2002 and one of the best so far of this decade. The first film seemed so unbeatable in terms of effects and adventure, but this takes it to the next level. There were some liberties taken with the book, but they don't hurt the story too much. I actually thought the elves fighting at Helm's Deep showed how noble they can be. It improves the audience's view of them. Even though all three films were shot together, all of the actors seem to be much more comfortable in their roles. This really seems to be Aragorn's film. That's not a bad thing as Viggo's Mortenson's performance is excellent. Gollum also takes centerstage as one of the most pitiful characters to hit the screen. He was portrayed well by Andy Serkis. Elijah Wood does an excellent job as Frodo. He's not the same hobbit he was in Fellowship, now he's beginning to understand the power of the ring and the pain it causes. Sean Astin gives a very innocent performance as Frodo's faithful companion, Sam. He also deliver one of the touching lines in the movie. Of the three story lines followed in this part of the mythical tale, the interaction of Pippin and Mary with Treebeard was my favorite. I was worried that the ents might appear silly but instead they come off as very wise vand calm creatures. As good as the theatrical version is I'm sure the extended version will improve upon it. With 43 extra minutes the epic will be even more monumental.",1058140800,,1502,4.465454545454546

The scenes involving Gollum (interacting with Frodo and Sam) are the only ones that really shine and remain true to Tolkien's characterization. I would buy the DVD just for these scenes.
The other plot points are so dumbed-down as to be Harry Potter-esque. Faramir turns out to be little better than his brother, Theoden's fall from greatness is changed from being a product of subtle mind-control and human despair to a simple wizard's spell, Gimli is transformed from a Dwarf to be reckoned with to an utter buffoon, and Aragorn seems to go through the motions of a lead character (complete with ""suspenseful"" dive off a cliff). I'm not saying the film should be an exact copy of the books. There's no practical way to do that. But certain basics of character and plot could be faithfully preserved without hopelessly confusing the average movie-goer (and i won't even get started with the HORROR of what Jackson did with Arwen).

I wish people would STOP talking about the general movie plot in these reviews - this should be where the discussion about the specific things related to the special edition are discussed.  The story can be discussed in the BOOK REVIEWS.  The general movie can be discussed in the basic dvd section.  Anyway...
The movie does not follow the original story.  Many reviews say 'so what' or 'it cannot be fit into a 3 hr movie'.  I disagree.  The problems I have with the film is NOT that it doesn't portray everything the way it happened in the book.  THe problem is they added some rather lengthy scenes that had no business or need in there such as Aragorns Death - the elves at Helms Deep - the useless scenes just to give Liv Tyler screen time (PUHLEEZ).  Jackson, in the short shows that where shown leading up to the first film release (Fellowship) made it clear it was critical to remain true to the story; he said this over and over again.  And then we get THIS?  Shorten that falling into the swamp scene, get rid of that nonsence with Liv Tyler, get rid of the Elves, and maybe get Shelob INTO THE FILM.  I have no problme with how the 'cloak pin was removed' - hand or mouth is irrellivant, but major story changes like Elves at Helms Deep?  Utter Nonsense.",1057881600,7,1309,4.359504132231405
1465022,4,B00005JKZU,"There are a few serious issues I have with the movie.  Being a hybrid purist, I'm not too upset with most of the changes in the movie.  However, there are two big changes that I think mar the work as a whole.  These are the changes in character for Theoden and Faramir.  In the books, Theoden, after being freed from Saruman's spell, rides out to meet Saruman's army and ends up at Helm's deep after a series of engagements.  Rather than one gigantic ""set piece"" I think the movie and Theoden's character would have been better served by the series of battles described in the book.  Perhaps more importantly, Eomer and Aragorn develop a friendship during these battles that is lost in the movie's use of Eomer as deus ex machina.  Secondly, in the book Faramir was wiser (and better looking) than in the movie.  He understood the dangers of the ring and the necessity of its destruction.  I understand why Peter Jackson made Faramir take Frodo captive.  He didn't think he could pull off four parallel timelines (Theoden & Aragorn, Merry & Pippin, Frodo, Faramir).  By keeping Faramir and Frodo together, he was able to only have to track three timelines.  Unfortunately, the attack on Osgiliath was still confusing and no one that I know caught the 20 second map scene where it was explained what the Two Towers meant.  I think a full minute might have been better here.  Other than these points, fabulous movie, highly recommended.

As with ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"", it would have been an even greater film had they just stuck completely to Tolkien's original words and scenes; the new scenes that replace them in the film are fine, but they do not improve on the original and have a slightly over-dramatic feel that seems gratuitous (especially Aragorn's death, which holds no dramatic tension at all since anyone who read the book would realize immediately that he will be revived in no time, since he plays a huge role in ""Return of The King"").  Although I realize that a three-hour film could never hope to contain everything in the book, they should have at least tried to make everything that was in there as faithful as possible, and I would rather have had some scenes that were cut from the book in place of Aragorn's protracted ""death"" sequence.  Anyways, I know I sound like a whiner but ""The Two Towers"" is kind of like the Mona Lisa, and tampering with it is no small item.  I am just thankful that the end result was still pretty amazing in all departments, thanks to all involved; the CGI Gollum sends chills down the spine.",1057622400,4,1344,4.451219512195122

There was more action and the story was going along instead of just introducing the characters. I have read the books and I must say that The Two Towers was a really good book. I would recommend it to anyone. However, I didn't really like the fact that they stopped and started the movies (1&2) in different places than the books. The end of the Two Towers ends earlier than the book so they are going to have to make the last movie longer so they can fit the rest of the Two Towers into it. Tolkien was an incredible author and I can't believe someone tried to make his books into a movie because it is (or in this case WAS) an impossible task. People tried to make The Lord of the Rings movies before and I am sure they wouldn't have come close to Jackson's version.

I would have loved it if the producers had felt that they could be 100% true to the book,  but every movie has a budget, and they couldn't afford to take a risk on these three since they had no clue as to how popular the movies would be.",1057536000,,544,3.963302752293578

Now, is it worthy of Best Picture?  No.  Is it worthy of the nomination?  No.  The films were nominated for the same reason Star Wars was: it brings forth brilliant new visuals.

While it may not follow Tolkien's work as closely as many fans would have hoped, Two Towers still proves itself an amazing, exhilarating triumph in cinematic history. Many self dubbed 'Tolkien Purists' have had ill to say of Peter Jackson's second installment to the trilogy.  They complain that The Two Towers film strays to far from the book... They're missing the point.  Any of the movie scenes that were different from the book were different for a reason.  The novel is way too long to be crammed into 180 minutes of film in its entirety. - Changes were made to both make the movie flow better and to accommodate the mechanics of the third film.  So complaints over the book-to-film differences are null.  And as much as I am a Tolkien fan, I must admit that many of the scenes in the movie were done with more power and emotion than the scenes described in the book.  Tolkien, it seems, was too gentle or vague in particular points in his novel.  Peter Jackson has taken scenes that may have been a little dull or a little lacking in the novel and brought them to life with power and heart.  Changes like these make The Two Towers a better film.  This movie matches the excellence of the Fellowship and does well in setting the stage for Return of the King.  Also, this movie is worth owning for the character Gollum alone.  Gollum has been brought to life in the most brilliant display of computer generated imagery to date.  And Andy Serkis (voice of Gollum) does an absolutely outstanding job in portraying the loss, sorrow, and insanity of Gollum's character. - A performance that is definitely not to be missed.

I have been reading this book over and over since I was ten. This movie could have and should have been better. However I am hoping that the third and final movie will make up for it.

1465290,5,B00005JKZU,"I think my title explains it all. The movie was absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe it. The only thing I didn't like...but it was awesome anyway, was that the battle of Helm's Deep was 1/3 of the movie. But then there is the directer's cut. (Sorry Peter, I know you hate directer's cuts!!!) Some stuff from the book wasn't in the movie.  But I think it would be rather hard to adapt such an amazing book, into an amazing movie. It was done! And it was 3 hours long. But DEFINENTLY worth sitting through again and again. (I did) Peter Jackson over-powers any other directer. It was brilliant. Howard Shore's music score for the movie can't even be described with words. I couldn't believe how fantastic it was. It matched the mood of what was happening in the movie. Also...there is the cast. I don't think they could've done better with the casting. From Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, to Gollum and the CG Ents. It was AMAZING. Everybody was perfect for their part.  (This is getting too long, so I'm leaving you now) But don't take my word for it, BUY THE MOVIE. It's a burden if you don't...like Frodo carrying the One Ring. Hee hee hee...just buy it. :)",1056931200,,1169,4.509433962264151
1465291,5,B00005JKZU,"Only a couple truly exceptional movies come out each year, Two Towers belongs in that category. Maybe it's the large scale adventure, the terrific cast, the incredible fighting scenes, or
story behind the madness of the war,the struggle to go on, despite how hopeless it may seem. Whatever the reason, I enjoyed the film from start to finish.
The difference between this film and the Fellowship, is that the warmth from the Fellowship the comfortable feeling that you had is gone, it is far darker and I imagine it only gets worse.
The movie starts out with Frodo and Sam going foward on their journey, early on you meet Gollum who was introduced briefly in the first one. When you see this long tortured creature you can't help but feel sorry for him, he's a representation of the Rings power over people (or Hobbits as it be) this makes Frodo pity him, who has himself been feeling a bit of the Rings control
Then you meet up again with the other members of the Fellowship, Aragorn (who hasn't forgotten about Erwen) Legolas and Gimli (who provides much of the humor throughout the movie)who are looking for Pippin and Merry, who have managed to be captured by Orcs, thus the plot unfolds. From the very beginning you're taken in, and from that point on you are swept away into a world of far larger scale than most movies even attempt.
By the end of the film you are wondering what comes next (unless you've read the books) what becomes of Frodo who can't fight the ring any longer? Does Sauron win over Middle Earth? Or does someone (not neccesary who you'd think)come to the rescue.
I suppose only time will tell
Note to hard-core die hard Tolkien fans: IF you want to see a movie that follows the book EXACTLY you may be dissapointed, because while this movie is terrific it does go its own way a bit
First of all, Merry&Pippin play a far larger part in the book with the Ents, I think this is done to incorporate the characters into the plot more, they made the Ents a little weaked willed. And secondly there is a scene with Aragorn and Erwen that occurs nowhere in the book, and this is done I believe to capture the female audience with the idea of the romance between the two.
But if you can look over these small changes I believe you will be very happy with the movie. I almost guarantee if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy the second, and I have a feeling the trilogy will end as well as it begun, so stay tuned.",1056844800,,2430,4.426339285714286
1465292,5,B00005JKZU,"This is a great film, with amazing special effects (I've seen it five times in the theater).  Granted, it strays from the book, but it remains true to the essence of the story-- and Gollum alone makes it worth watching over and over.  WORD TO THE WISE-- wait until November when the extended version of the DVD is going to be released.  Waiting for the extended release made SUCH a huge difference in Lord of the Rings-- giving more background to the story and providing details and extras that really added so much to the film.  This one will be no different.",1056758400,,560,4.46078431372549

Fitting everything from the book into one film would be extremely hard without upsetting the audience because of the long running time. Hopefully the true LOTR fans will get back scenes that were not in the movie from the special edition DVD, and will be satisfied. This movie will go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time!

(and that's saying something considering the length!) After seeing the Two Towers I was so excited for the rest that I went out and read The Return of the King (awesome book), and now I'm a Lord of the Rings junkie. The battle of Helm's Deep WAS AMAZING!!! The uruki (i think thats how you spell it) were so realistic and truly terrified me. An amazing film... rent it~>watch it~>love it~>buy it",1056758400,,546,4.415841584158416
1465344,4,B00005JKZU,"Be warned - this review is more about the relationship between the movie and the story and less about the movie itself.
I grew up with LOTR.  It was read to me as a bedtime story as a child and was re-read every couple of years since.  When hiking in forest or mountain, I amused myself by wondering if this is what Fangorn Forest, Emyn Muil or Mordor looked like and wondered if it was the wind moving the trees or if perhaps they were moving on their own.  I felt the age-old wisdom of the Ents, the pride of dwarves through Gimli, Aragorn's self-doubt and conflicts, and Faramir's nobility when over-coming the temptation of the Ring.  I named my first born Aragorn.
I understood why Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest and much of the preamble had to go in The Fellowship of the Ring.  The teeter-totter staircase in the Mines of Moria was not needed, but forgiven by perfectly imagined Balrog.  The first movie stayed very close to the spirit of the book if not the story.
What I do not understand is why Peter Jackson felt it necessary to diverge so much from the spirit of the story in the Two Towers.  Why was it necessary to present Merry and Pippin as having changed the minds of the Ents when in the book the Ents arrive at the need to attack Isengard on their own?  Why present the Ents as jerky stick men?  Why needlessly have Faramir bring Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath instead of letting them go earlier on and thus presenting Faramir as a far more noble.  Why have Legolas and Gimli be some Middle-Earth version of Laurel and Hardy?  One giggle in The Fellowship was enough - the antics they put Gimli through in the Two Towers are completely unnecessary.
However - the scenes of Gollum's internal debate, the battle at Helm's Deep, the interaction between Theoden, Grima (Wormtongue) and Gandalf in Meduseld and Sam, Frodo and Gollum's walk through the Dead Marshes to the Gates of Mordor were awesome.  The scenes of mothers sending their very young sons off to battle at Helm's Deep were immensely powerful.  We even got see the caves of Helm's Deep to which Tolkien alluded but never described.
I wonder what else will be dropped or changed in Return of the King?  Will Aragorn travel the Paths of the Dead?  Will it be Eowyn who slays the Nazgul or is it Merry who becomes the hero?  Will Shelob look as bad as the Ents?
This movie could have been, should have been great, as it is, it's merely good.",1056672000,5,2411,4.445454545454545
1465345,3,B00005JKZU,"From a theatrical standpoint, The Two Towers was well done.  The acting, special effects, etc. were excellent.  In my opinion TTT was the best movie of 2002.
It is understandable that any movie based on a book will deviate to a certain extent.  The Fellowship of the Ring was well done and deviations were acceptable.  The Two Towers deviates much more from pure Tolkien.  Some deviations are acceptible, however, there are several key alterations to the plot that are very dissapointing and without reason.
Gandalf's battle with the Balrog was excellent and a welcome addition since the book leaves this part to imagination.  Well done.
I enjoyed the warg battle since the book only briefly mentions the wargs and including them would be impossible without a confrontation.  However, Aragorn falling off the cliff was just an emotional ploy to enrich the cheezy love story included in the movie.
Faramir's weakened character along with Frodo's forced journey to Osgiliath was completely uncalled for.  Frodo still utimately is set free and heads to Mordor so why change the plot?  That part of the movie also felt very rushed.
Adding Elves to the battle of Helm's Deep makes for a much more visually stunning battle and can be overlooked.  It was described in the book, however as a victory for the world of men.  It seemed that after an hour of building up the battle that it came to a very abrubt end after Gandalf showed up.  Within a minute of Gandalf showing up, he's stating that the battle for Helm's Deep is over and that the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.  We see men and elves getting their butts kicked.  How about seeing some Orc butt being kicked before suddently ending the battle sequence? (Maybe in the extended version)
I would have also liked to see more development of the Ents and not as idiots as the film makes them out to be.
I've watched the film 4 times and each time it has grown on me a little more.  However from a purist standpoint, the FOTR stays much more true to the book.
I look forward to the extended version and hope to see additional footage that moves the movie back towards the book rather than futher away.  This movie receives 3 stars for great action, special effects and a good attempt at re-creating Middle Earth.  It loses two stars for unacceptible deviations from the book.",1056672000,3,2333,4.678921568627451
1465346,5,B00005JKZU,"The quest continues to destroy Sauron's ring in this remarkable sequel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The Two Towers manages to retain the same amount of characterization, story development, and theatrical style that made the first film so powerful and amazing.
The film's characters are still remarkably well-developed.  Their relationships flourish and grow more complicated, as Frodo becomes more corrupt and Gollum reveals a split personality (which is shown extremely well in the film!).  There's also more humor among the existing characters.
Surprisingly, supporting characters rarely seen in the original book are also further developed (Arwen, Elrond, and Celeborn make a reappearance).  And new characters also recieve a fair amount of development.  The only bad thing about the characters is that Saruman doesn't make much of an appearance.
The film retains the same visual style as the last film.  There's more large-scale shots, particuarly as the armies of Mordor are seen marching across the land.  It's breathtaking to see thousands and thousands of orcs marching across the screen; there's no other film like it.  The battle of Helm's Deep is equally remarkable and is the highlight of the whole film.  Also noteworthy are the ents, who ultimately sack Isengard.  Even the ruined city where the Nazgul rule was done well.  Among all these great scenes, there's still some artistic elements as well that embellish the story's ideas.
There are certain elements that the film has incorporated that were not present in the original story, such as the elves' involvement in Helm's Deep, or Aragorn's battle with the orc wolf-riders.  These added elements may take away from the accuracy of the movie, but are still enjoyable to watch.
This movie serves as a fine chapter in the whole trilogy.  It's just as good as the last film and is very much worthy of watching.",1056672000,,1881,5.127868852459017
1465347,5,B00005JKZU,"I think it isn't necessary to add anything more about the movie itself. It's great, we all know that. The question is: is it worth it to buy this edition? Because there will be the extended edition, coming out in November.
This is money talking. It's obvious that the idea is to get you to buy both editions. You're craving for this movie!! You've been waiting for it since it left the theatres, and you'll be out there, in the 26th of August, first thing in the morning, to get it. But then, when the extended edition comes out, you'll want to get it too, because it has all those extra scenes and features. What to do?
I think that if you really liked the movie but don't want to spend a lot of money, it's better to rent it and then buy the extended edition. But note that in the ""Fellowship"" the extra scenes didn't really add anything to the movie. Excluding the hobbit's presentation, it was more a promotion of the beautiful New Zealand landscape. I'm hoping that, in ""The Two Towers"", the extra scenes will add more to the battle of Helm's Deep, or some new facts that weren't visualised in the theatre version.
On the other hand, once you watch the extended version, that's it. The normal version is perfect if you want to review the movie, simply because it's shorter.
In conclusion, if you're a hard-core fan and can afford it, buy both versions. But, having to choose, I would go for the extended edition, since you can always rent the normal version.",1056499200,,1463,4.462686567164179
1465442,5,B00005JKZU,"It has been a long time since I've seen Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers in a theater and now I can't wait to get the DVD!  I do find The Two Towers to be better than the first part, The Fellowship of the Ring, because of the much increased action and comedy sequences.  The Two Towers focuses on group of characters throughout the movie so you get to know characters like Pippin and Merry a lot better.  ....So here is the thing,  The special extended edition is coming out again just like before.  All of the documentaries and material on Disc 3 and 4 seems like it will easily match the material on the FotR Disc 3 and 4 of the extended edition and the extended ed. of FotR including the extra materials was extremely awesome by the way.  The difference is that FotR had about 30 minutes of added footage.  TTT's Extended Edition will have over 40 minutes of added footage.  Woohooo.  Hey,  Longer is a lot better when you are talking about LotR because I can never get enough of it.  It is too bad that the extended edition won't come out for another 4-ish months, but until then... I can watch the theatrical edition dvd that I am also getting.
  I find that buying both the theatrical and extended edition is needed in this case with The Two Towers.  The theatrical edition will first of all hold you off until you get the extended edition.  Also,  The theatrical edition has ""The Long and the Short of It"" which is Sean Astin's short film made while shooting LotR (I really want to see this).... It has a few tv documentaries.... It has a preview of the Extended Ed. dvd AND a 10 minute preview of Return of the King!!!  It also has some short featurettes that were featured on the website and other stuff like music videos and trailers.  Guess what.... The Extended Edition has none of that stuff that I just said.... So it is like you are getting totally new stuff on the Extended Edition... The ext. ed. is like an entirely new movie almost with the hours of GREAT special features and documentaries you get that you will not have ever seen even if you get the theatrical version.  I suggest to people that you buy both so that you don't miss out on things like the Sean Astin film... If you only have enough money to buy one, then definitely buy the Extended Edition......
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is proving to be my favorite movie of all time.  I hope that others will find out about it, rent it, or see it in theaters and enjoy it as much as I do.",1056412800,,2468,4.298701298701299
1465443,2,B00005JKZU,"The coming out on DVD of an extended edition of ""The Two Towers"" gives me a chance to air some of my thoughts regarding Peter Jackson's adaptational techniques before they are buried under several hundred other (probably rave) reviews.  And though, like these other reviewers, I too appreciate the hard-work, dedication, and expert craftsmanship that have gone into making this version of ""Lord of the Rings"" the most stunning yet to appear on film, I do not think history will be kind to it in the end.
This is not b/c I am a Tolkien purist, or do not understand the fundamental differences between literature and film.  I generally liked ""Fellowship"", and fully approved of the changes made to the story whenever they served the interests of narrative or pacing.  My only complaint with it was that it often felt too much like an action movie, with no pauses to build tension, mood, or atmosphere as the characters went from one battle (or chase) to the other.  Sadly, these genre tendencies have only been exaggerated in the second film, and have taken it over to such an extent that even fundamental plot points have been altered just to better fit the zig-zag rising action pattern of most action movies.  This explains not only major changes (the battle with the Wargs, Aragorn's ""death""), but also minor ones (Gandalf's warning that retreating to Helm's Deep only created a trap; Merry & Pippin having to ""trick"" Treebeard into intervening).  In most action films, everything the heroes achieve until the final confrontation either have mixed results, or are a choice between evils, as this ratchets up the tension.  ""The Two Towers"" slavishly follows this formula, hence the deviations from text which have so infuriated some Tolkien fans.
Such changes as were made I would be willing to endure and more if they produced a film that still kept the dignity and moral seriousness of the books; as is, though, I think what's been created is a medieval version of ""Independence Day"", and fans will, in the end, turn just as savagely on this film as they did on that other one.",1056326400,9,2080,4.809523809523809
1465444,5,B00005JKZU,"Where LOTR: The Fellowship of the Rings was a set up for what the next two movies would be about, The Two Towers jumps in and moves at a much quicker pace than the first one.  As good as the first one was, the pace, action and suspense far outweigh the Fellowship in many ways.  With continuation of the battle for middle Earth, humans are forced to stand their ground at secluded keep in the mountians, knowing full well that a huge battle is to come.  Wholly outmatched and out numbered, they bravely take posts knowing that if Gandalf the White doesn't return with an army, all will be lost.  There is no doubt that the scale of this movie could not have been accurate had CGI not progrssed to what it is today.  The massive armies number in the hundreds of thousands, and you can see it.  For great grand epic adventures, this one tops them all.",1056326400,,849,4.341772151898734

This is a must add to your collection. The main reason is it adds 45 minutes of never seen before footage into the movie, not including the 5 hours of bonus material! I cant wait.

1465556,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers was the greatest movie of 2002. The movie diverges from the book on some (in my opinion) minor plot points. But it follows the journey of the sundered Fellowship very well. From the dramatic opening to the close of the movie, The Two Towers delivers action, romance, drama, and a wee bit of comedy (courtesy of the wonderful Gimli the Dwarf). Everything about this movie is wonderful, from the battle of Helm's Deep to the Ents (which took my breath away). The development of the character Gollum was amazing. The only plot change I don't like is Faramir wanting the ring. I like the book versio of Faramir's encounter with the ring much better. Anyway, the acting is amazing, special effects spectacular, and the plot is wonderful. This movie is wonderful and it deserves 5 stars.",1056240000,,796,4.733812949640288
1465557,5,B00005JKZU,"So what if they strayed a little off the book while making the movie. It only made the movie better! I also liked Faramir's personality in the movie better. The Lord of the Ring's actors are some of the best actors in the world. The battle of Helm's Deep was Spectacular! If you gave this movie less than 5 stars, I advise you to seek some therapy.

The noble Ents are poorly done ""Rock-biters"" (See ""Never-ending Story"") and have lost the wisdom and nobility they had in books.  How could the same crew that wowed us with the Balrog give us jerky, fake looking Ents?  The dragons look slightly less menacing than a sick salamander and show the same shoddy work given the Ents.  Golum as a character was great.  The battle between both personalities was fun to watch, but here again the CGI work was lacking.  I was disappointed that even here in our new star of the film the muscle tone isn't performing as it should.  When limbs flex, muscles bulge and crease around the joints.  Other CGI characters have shown this, why not Golum?  Mary and Pippin have been reduced to no importance at all and the movie has changed the path that Frodo and Sam took (and sadly, not for the better).  Changes in the book are fine if done well (like the first movie) but the changes here have watered the story down and caused me to lose my enthusiasm for this work.",1056153600,6,1101,4.432835820895522

One thing you also need to keep in mind is that the special features are totally new and different from the theatrical DVD.

 Bonus DVD on the Weta Workshop and how the Gollum statue was created, featuring interviews with Peter Jackson.
 A printed companion piece showing how Gollum evolved from pencil sketch to sculpted maquette to digital character.

Two Towers is a staggering film.  Helm's Deep might just be the finest battle scene ever filmed.  The visuals are simply stunning.
The film does not follow the book but that's for the better.  The book is very linear and that would not have translated well into a movie experience.

1465664,5,B00005JKZU,"Some observations about the film trilogy so far:
The total length of the harcover trilogy (not including introductions and appendixes) is 1032 pages.
The Fellowship of the Ring - 397 pages
The Two Towers  - 340 pages
The Return of the King  - 295 pages
Jackson's first film (""Fellowship"") covered all 397 pages of book one (skipping the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil scenes, which did not bother me) and about 10 pages from (the book) ""The Two Towers"", for a total movie ""page count"" of 407 pages.
This film, however, covers only 221 pages of (the book) ""The Two Towers"".  It still requires about 220 minutes in this extended edition to cover only a little more than half the written material covered in the first film.
This leaves a total of 404 pages (from ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" combined) to be covered in the third film.
The reason for the small amount of the trilogy covered in this film is evident in the Theatrical Version...a single chapter in the book (The battle of the Hornburg/Helm's Deep) takes over an hour of the film.  This is not a bad thing...but there will have to be a tradeoff.
The book ""The Return of the King"" includes an even bigger battle (Pelennor Fields)...will it get an hour?  It should...but it's hard to imagine how even just the most critical scenes not yet covered will all fit in the final film!
In his audio commentary on the extended DVD version of ""Fellowship"" (which is a must listen!), director Jackson reveals he will *not* be including the final battle of the book trilogy (The Scouring of the Shire) in his movie at all, extended or theatrical.  This does bother me.  Without this scene a main theme of the trilogy is lost.  It seems likely that many scenes that occur after the defeat of Sauron will not be included.
I can only hope that the extended version of ""the Return of the King"" will run 5 hours...it will need to.",1056067200,5,1886,4.526470588235294
1465665,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is absolutely one of the greatest movies ever made. This has a great story as well as great acting and amazing, I mean amazing special effects. Gollum is the best CGI character to date, no questions. Peter Jackson is doing a great job on bringing these films from book to movie. There is a difference between the movie and the book, but so what. To some movie goers 3 hours is way too long and if you put everything that was in the book in this movie, you would have WAY more than a 3 hour movie. This movie ROCKS and if you haven't seen it, DO SO! This Extended Version is going to be awesome (Just like The Fellowship Extended Version was). With up to 43 minutes of added seens, how can you go wrong in buying this. This is the ultimate DVD for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers!",1056067200,,792,4.14935064935065
1465666,4,B00005JKZU,"The only reason it gets a 4 from me is Shelob and a certain capture and the passing of the torch between wizards (so not to give too much away) was not in it.  Other than that this movie has the best battle scene I have ever seen in a movie.  Because I am LOTRs, I was captivated by this movie.  I actually shed a tear during the first movie while I was in the theater.  These movies are so well done in the department of scale, acting and of course the epic story.  And for those that thought it was a little brief during different scenes in The Two Towers, the extra 40+ minutes should help that out like in the extended Fellowship did.",1056067200,,638,4.072
1465667,3,B00005JKZU,"I didn't really like the first movie in the Lord of the Rings Triligy until the second time I saw it, so The Two Towers may be the same way.  Not that I'm saying it was all bad.  It just seemed WAY too long.  They could have cut a lot of those fight scenes in half and still have gotten the point across.
The Two Towers picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring abruptly ends.  There isn't really anything telling about the first movie except for the scene with Gandoph's famous line ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS"" and when the demon pulls him into the pit, you follow him and see him stabing the demon with his sword on the fall, until they hit land, and that's when Frodo wakes up and realizes that Gandoph's fall was a dream.  Golum (the creature that wants ""our precious"") has a bigger role in this part of the story than in the first one.  He actually is one of the main characters.  Golum (with his split personalitys) act's as Frodo's and Sam's guide to the black gate of Mordor.  Also, the other remaining part of the Fellowship of the ring after it split up went off to find the two hobbits that were captured by the Orcs in the first movie.  They escape from the Orcs, and venture into a dark forest complete with walking and talking trees, but I'll get back to them.  Meanwhile, the Orcs from Isengard (the evil wizards tower) are sent to attack a castle that held one of the few groups of men that didn't go to the evil side.  These people are then joined by the Elfs, and are losing the war against the Orcs until Gandoph comes back (Frodo's dream was true) as instead of Gandoph the Grey, as Gandoph the White.  He is accompanied by an army that beat's the orcs.  Meanwhile, the trees see what Isengard's orcs did to the forest and declare war.  They attack the tower, and destroy it by breaking a dam and flooding it, stopping all of the orc's industry in the process.  Then, when the story should be over, Golums evil side takes over, and decides to kill Sam and Frodo in order to get ""Our Precious,"" and then decides that a mysterious ""she"" should kill them.  And then, after a 3 hour movie (6 hours of story so far), the movie stops and leaves off for part 3.  Return of the King.
Long story, huh?  Something good about this movie was the excellent special effects.  I imagine that it was done by ILM, and if it was, it was their work at their best.  Some of that stuff that they did in this movie was so impressive that it was hard to imagine it being fake.
Lord of the Rings has so many underlieing themes that you notice as you watch it.  Of course, there's the good/evil theme which may be why it's so much like Star Wars, or maybe because Star Wars has the same type of fighting scenes.  There's also the theme of industry taking over agriculture.  The evil is industry, and the good is agriculture.  All of the evil forces in the story cut down forests, make objects, etc, while good forces are all farmers that live off of the land, or mine, or do something that doesn't involve destorying something for good.  Like in the real world, industry will win (hate to ruin the ending).
I'll give this movie 3 stars, but as a whole, the triligy may be worth possibly even 5 stars.",1056067200,,3188,4.273333333333333

I hope someone from New Line (or whoever is responsible) is reading these critiques because I want to add my voice to those who are piqued about this ploy (which started last year with the first installment of the trilogy). To be sure, Peter Jackson's is an exciting interpretation of the Tolkien saga and I will definitely want to add The Two Towers to my DVD library. But this time I am prepared to wait for the extended version (assuming the reports are true) and urge all who care about this movie and want to savor everything that went into making it to do the same.

1465671,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers measures up to all the expectations most viewers wanted. After a great movie like Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers had high expectations, not only by me, I imagine. Almost everything about this movie is great. The battle scences, the heros, the setting of where it takes place all fits in wonderfully. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The only sequel I can think of that measures up to The Two Towers is The Matrix Reloaded.
We start up in The Two Towers seeing a scene from the middle of Fellowship. Gandalf's legendary battle with the Balrog. Except this time, we see more of it. We see Gandalf fall, catch his sword while he is falling, and we see him fight the Balrog while they are both falling. So at the start of the movie we know, Gandalf has NOT fallen to his death. He falls with the Balrog as they both fight valiantly. We see how Sam and Frodo are doing, traveling to Mordor, and they pick up a new guest, to travel with them, Gollum. Gollum helps them and leads them through the Dead Marshes, and he says he knows of a secret way into Mordor, but will Gollum actually lead them there, or leave them to die? We also see how Pippin and Merry are, which isn't to well. The got captured in Fellowship of the Ring, by the Uruk-Hai. They are still being held captive, heading to Isengaurd at a terribly fast pace. Aragorn, Legoles, and Gimli chase after the Uruk-Hai in the fields of Rohan, until the meet Eomer, a soldier of Rohan. Aragorn asks if he as seen the two hobbits, but Eomer and his group slayed the Uruk-Hai that was carrying Pippin and Merry. Fortunatly, they escaped the battle and head into the Fangorn Forest. Aragorn, Legoles, and Gimli were given horses. They went to the battle site, found the tracks and went into the Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf. The four of them go to see Theoden, the king of Rohan. Theoden leads his people to the stronghold of Helms Deep. There they are attacked by 10,000 Uruk-Hai. The battle of Helms Deep is one of the coolest battles I have seen in my life. It is the sweetest thing. Peter Jackson did this so well. The whole movie itself is very well done, and very cool.

1465773,2,B00005JKZU,"To edit a book in order to make it into a movie such as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' did, is very common place and acceptable.  After all squeezing an epic reading experience into 2 hours is impossible.  On the other hand what happened in 'The Two Towers'(?) is like splatting some paint onto a canvas and passing it off as a Picasso.  To alter the inherent nature of a main character is a crime against the book, and no longer worthy of it's title.  Peter Jackson could just as well have started from scratch and made a great movie, but let's face it, he wanted to cash in on a much loved classic, not honor it.",1055808000,2,612,4.205128205128205
1465774,4,B00005JKZU,"While the Fellowship of the Ring took us on an emotional roller costar following Frodo from his peaceful Hobbit life to his unwanted role as ring bearer, to his decision to carry the ring though he was not asked, to his final, desperate act of breaking the fellowship for everyone's safety regardless of his own peril; the two towers merely connects that story with the final chapter.
The film opens with a great scene of Gandalf slaying the Balrog, then all threads connecting to the first film begin to fray. Peter Jackson opted for spectacle over story telling for this middle chapter. Likely he feared people would bore easily in this long, long chapter (to be nearly 4 hrs in it's extended glory!!!) so he turned the battle of Helms Deep into the chapters focal point. Unfortunately by doing this he reduced the hobbits interaction with Treadbare (is my spelling correct?) to little more than endless, boring shots of Pippin and Merry bouncing up and down while the tree talks very slowly and sounds way too much like a certain Dwarf in the film (because John Ryse-Daives plays both and the sound of his voice is so obvious it's distracting!) The destruction of Saruman's Foundry / Breading pit is too fast because they have no time in this film if they want the 30 min plus Helms Deep battle to play out (the order of events is drastically changed and the dramatic highpoint of Gandalf facing off with his defeated master is left to the next film, a big, big mistake as it could have salvaged the dramatic shallowness of this film.)
This is an action film, not a story. There is wall to wall amazing action (yeah, like that Matrix Sequel) the battles are biblical, the humor is thick, the spectacle is breathtaking and awe inspiring. Unfortunately the story of the Hobbit, the man who would be king and the Wizard that holds it all together is swamped under the action and humor. All the best drama, the real tension, the character development is spared for the last installment.
Then there's the damned voice overs!!! Don't get me started on the flashbacks and narration that takes place. Every thirty minutes some Elf starts explaining the emotional and dramatic death of the story that you are not seeing, the endless exposition of narrative is mind numbing, stupefying and painful to sit through. It's just, Peter, we get what's going on, now start showing and stop telling.
Of course, Gollum is the high point here. Our only really fully developed character with real emotional weight and dramatic impact (as well as great humor) Forget the forced love triangle, the bull - s*** with the Arwyn and Eoywn that's not even in the book, Gollum is the star and driving force of this film. See it for them, they make it real when the real (not CGI) people can't.

1465775,5,B00005JKZU,"The second part to Peter Jackson's collosal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is even more visually impressive than FELLOWSHIP, with new characters including King Theoden, Eomer, Grima Wormtounge and the ancient Treebeard. This time around, the fellowship has parted into three groups; Frodo and Sam force Gollum to take them to the black gate at Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin. And the Istari Gandalf returns as the more powerful Gandalf the White after defeating the Balrog. The story is more emotional than Fellowship, and the central characters are stronger presences than before. Jackson's excellent direction makes this one of the most amazing films ever made. From the march of the ents toward Isengard, Saruman unleashing his army to ""Destroy the world of men"", it all culminates in the incredible battle of Helm's Deep, an amazing action sequence where the seamless blend of CG and live-action builds up to a fantastic climax.
Howard Shore's strident score encapsulates the very essence of Tolkein's thoughts and emotions. Ian McKellen turns in another great performance as Gandalf, but it is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn who does most of the action here, and he's great. John Rhys- Davies and Orlando Bloom provide strong gravitas, plus with such a vast array of strong supporting actors, the combined strength of veterans like Benard Hill as Theoden and Christopher Lee as Saruman makes the story come alive.
As strong as the characters are in TOWERS however, it's the CG-created Gollum that is the most amazing. Putting lame Jar-Jar and Harry Potter creatures to shame, Andy Serkis' performance helps the emotional presence of an essentially computer-generated character come to life. Treebeard and the Ents are fantastic examples of top-notch CG, but they say that the best effects are the ones you don't notice, which is true in this film. You are so focused on the story, the fleshed-out characters and the spirit of Tolkein's tome coming to life that the CG is simply assisting the tale. This is a film which you have to watch at least three times to fully appreciate all the effort that went into making a true masterpiece.
This is one of the most eagerly-awaited DVD releases this year. Extras include an on set documentary: The Two Towers, ""Return to Middle-earth"" making of the movie, eight lordoftherings.net featurettes, trailers and the ""Gollum Song"" music video.

This movie makes me want to actually pick up the book and start reading. The casting, the effects, the costumes, Gollum, all excellent work.

1465904,4,B00005JKZU,"Some movies are critic-proof. No matter how much the critics pan it, people will still flock to the theaters to watch it. Some movies go beyond that. They have legions of crazed devotees who will physically harm any who dares to disparage their beloved movie. So critics who did so did it at their own peril. Star Wars Episode Two (released last spring) was a good example. Critics who had the thankless job of describing the movie as it was-a  veritable tripe- were nevertheless extremely cautious in choosing their words. Most of them chose to be apologetic. The ones with a weak heart caved in, and lied about how much they loved it. The brave ones ventured forth in a typical display of martyrdom. Whatever their stances were, one thing didn't change. Everyone went to see it.
  Lord of the Rings-The Two Towers is a movie much like Star Wars. The story has such a large fan-base that the movie's appeal will hold regardless of its quality. Thankfully,(and luckily for the critics) there is no such dilemma here. Here is a movie that truly lives up to its famed legacy.
  The Two Towers which is the second installment to the trilogy, picks up from where the last movie ended. The Fellowship is broken, with Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor and Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas  in search for Pippin and Merry who have been abducted by the Orcs. The film branches off to three directions, following the events that happen to each of the separated parties. In addition to familiar faces, some interesting new characters are also introduced. The Treebeards, the Rohans, and Gollum to name a few. While the story doesn't veer far from what's in the book, there are some subtle changes. For instance the elven princess Arwen plays a larger role than in the original story, and the movie ends earlier than what is allotted in the book.
  The film is truly a feast for the eye in which CGI blends perfectly with human actors. Unlike Star Wars where the special effects were actually hindrances to the smooth-running of the plot, here the CGI enhances the  story. With every breath-taking scenery the audience is drawn deeper into Tolkien's fictional world. There are three much talked-about scenes in the movie. The first one is the one with Gollum. Here we are presented with a fully digitized computer creation which is life-like to each strand of hair. Not only is its appearance realistic, its performance actually borders on being 'moving'. It is truly a feat for the special effects department to have created such a marvel of digital technology. The second scene, is of course, the much raved-about 'Siege at the Helms Deep'. Most critics lauded it as one of the best siege sequences of all time. While I'm not ready to bestow such lavish praise on it, one must admit that it is very well orchestrated. Each and every CGI characters are given different movements, and the texture of the walls shows that the creators didn't overlook a single slab of stone. What is even more impressive than the visual , is the pacing of the action. It displays a deft hand at work, shrewdly controlling the flow of adrenaline in the audiences' blood. Peter Jackson deserves much credit for his skillful handling of such a huge and lengthy action sequence. The third scene is where the Treebeards demolish Saruman's stronghold. The scene here has such a biblical grandeur that if one were to sample a movie-still from it and enlarge it into a mural, it should belong in a museum.
  As for the acting, it is uniformly strong. Ian Mckellen brings authority to the grizzled wizard Gandalf.  Elijah Wood is effective in conveying the inner burden felt by Frodo. Newcomers Miranda Otto, and Bernard Hill do commendable jobs as Ewoyn and the Rohan King, Theoden. Of course the biggest scene-stealer is Viggo Mortensen whose Aragorn exudes such sincere charm, that one could literally hear the female audience swoon in their seats.
  The Two Towers is the second part of a trilogy, meaning that there is another film  yet to come out. Anyone who's read Tolkien's trilogy will know what is in store for us, which is more reason to be excited about. This second installment of the trilogy is a proud equal to the  superb first feature, and with two successes under its belt, this trilogy is already slated to be in the top film archives.",1055462400,,4315,4.725699067909454

1466046,5,B00005JKZU,"I never thought I would see such a magnificent transfer of Tolkien's work from the written word to the big (and little) screen. After years of disappointing animated efforts this trilogy exceeded my expectations.
The Two Towers continues the story established in The Fellowship of the Ring. Readers of Tolkien's works had little problem following the story line (or in lamenting the number of excluded scenes in the movie) but first-time viewers missed much of the underlying tapestry of Middle Earth.
The same holds for this edition. The action is spectacular, and the story remains *reasonably* faithful to the written version, but what is missing from the screen version is the sense of depth readers got from the songs and notes in the books.  The movie *is* different from the books, so Tolkien purists may want to keep a list of their grievances. ;)  My biggest objection is that the movie portays present society attitudes about warfare--a reluctance to engage in combat.  This was simply not the case in the books.  Any reluctance to fight was due to Sauruman's influence (via Wormtongue), that is to say, PROPAGANDA...an important point in the book that does not come across in the movie.  There are other differences, but this was to be a 2.5 hour movie, not an entire mini-series unto itself!
Despite the drawbacks the movie is excellent. It is as visually appealing as the first movie and the computer generated scenes mesh well with the live action footage, though not quite to the same level as _Attack of the Clones_.
The DVD will deliver the usual extra features: interviews with the actors, previews of the third movie, a sneak peek at the video game and additional audio/visual choices.
This will be an essential addition for fans of Tolkien, though anyone who will be purchasing the eventual ""special collector's platinum anniversary utlimate edition trilogy boxed set"" releases you know are coming in the years ahead might want to consider buying this used or simply renting it, then purchasing the special edition(s) that will be released in 2004 and beyond.",1054944000,,2079,4.979827089337176
1466047,5,B00005JKZU,"My review is based on the cinema version so my view are strictly about the film. I suppose I have an ""advantage"" in that I haven't read the books ...yet. Therefore no ""disappointment"" as some of the Tolkien purists seem have experienced.  I have the book set sitting on my shelf at home as they have been for years waiting for me to read them someday. Having read some of the other reviews I think I'll wait until the film of ""Return Of the King"" is released later in the year before I pick up the books or maybe I'll just read to ""Two Towers"". With my reading track record it'll probably take me that long anyway!
I thoroughly enjoyed ""Two Towers"". The second film in any trilogy is the hardest to make as it's a linking film. The ""Star Wars"" series & Prequels are a good example of that.  But ""Two Towers"" is big in quality especially the acting from the lead characters. It's a long perilous journey that we take with Frodo and company and we're right there with them during their highs and lows thanks to some superd camera work. (I look forward to the extended DVD set as I am currently enjoying the FOTR 4 disc version). A huge standard has been set by the making of these films and I expect  no less from ""Return"" when released. It's a benchmark that will be hard to top in future. If you are a Tolkien purist it might be hard to divorce yourself from the book/film comparisons. But one should enjoy the films for what they are...majestic and glorious in their presentation, wonderful to watch with the family. I found watching FOTR on DVD to be more rewarding as there were things that I missed the first time around that were better explained on second or third viewing. Two Towers is no less a masterpiece and it will be wonderful on DVD when released. If the packaging & presentation of the extended version in November is anything like FOTR then I'll await it with much anticipation.",1054857600,,1895,4.4240687679083095

I, as a loyal devotee of the books, was not the least bit disappointed with the material left out in the Fellowhsip of the Ring, and am not disappointed in the Two Towers. TTT is one of the greatest achievments in movie history, with both great special effects, great actors, and one of the greatest books ever written adapted into a great movie.
I am not going to write the plot of the movie as you have to go see it for yourself, but I will write that what most impressed me in this movie was not Gollum or the Battle of Helm's Deep (both of which were EXCELLENT), but the actors. Most every performance was believable and the characters were excellently portrayed.
In short, I give this movie a well-deserved 5 stars.

Yes, there were many things left out of Jackson's movie, but for the regular movie goer or someone who is just beginning to enjoy The Lord Of The Rings it is great.  The way Jackson mixed the action of Aragorn and company with that of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum made me happy.  I think that was one thing that I least enjoyed about the book.  Despite inaccuracies in dialogue, setting, and timing I think the movie was excecuted pretty well.  I cannot wait to see the extra footage in the extended DVD.",1054080000,,595,4.324324324324325
1466279,5,B00005JKZU,"Well here it is, the moment all LOTR fans have been waiting for: the release of the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's/Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. And to sum up what I thought about the movie in one sentence: The Two Towers is a magnificent sequel to an equally magnificent film (The Fellowship of the Ring). And, for all those long-time Tolkien fans who thought Peter Jackson went far too astray from the books, this movie stays very faithful to the book, minus some unnecessary dialogue/scenes, that would have bogged the film down. Though, I should mention, some end sequences that were in the original publication (Book) have been moved to the last film; The Return of the King.
  The first thing I would like to talk about is the mood of the film; the Two Towers has very dark and depressing feeling to it (which I like) that really expresses the dire situations the characters are in. The film really has a very foreboding presence to it. It really makes you feel as though you are there, at Helm's Deep, waiting to fight, waiting to die. And thins rings true to all the scenes, whether your with Frodo and Sam on their impossible journey, or with Merry and Pippen, trying to free them selves from the orc's grasp. Whatever scene it is, it makes you feel as though you are apart of the movie. A feeling I thoroughly enjoyed.
  The Computer Generated Images (CGI) are amazing. They blend in with the rest of the scenery so well, it almost seem as though they're real images rolling across the screen. All through the film this holds true, even in the battle scenes in Helm's Deep where a huge amount of Animation was used, it still looked real! And, when you talk about CGI in the Two Towers, you have to, of course, mention Gollum. The CGI the filmmakers use to make him is also spectacular, making him have that almost-real look to him. Gollum is one of the most life-like CGI characters I have ever seen on film.
  The cinematography is, as the first film also was, the best I have every seen; the exuberant colors, the razor sharp tint of the actors eyes, the exciting camera angles that make this movie all the more breathtaking.
  And the plot of the film is (of course) amazing! The Lord of the Rings book saga is probably the best literature written in the 20th century. And all of that masterful storytelling is carried over on to film.
  I thought I should also mention the comedy in this film, mainly delivered by Gimli, the dwarf. His comedy really lightens up this very dark film without making it corny.
  `So,' you might ask, `Is the Two Towers, the second film better then the first?' (The Fellowship of the Ring) To state it simply... No, in my opinion, The Fellowship is a tat-bit better the Two Towers. But I certainly couldn't argue with anyone who said other wise...",1053993600,7,2804,4.53069306930693

Even if it wasn't Tolkien's middle earth.  It was still a fine rendition of a classic novel.

1466408,5,B00005JKZU,"When I first saw the movie, I was a bit disappointed; I was blown away by the wonderful effects, sounds, music, locations, makeup, design, battle sequences etc. yet was somewhat upset about the changes in the plot. Walking back to the car after the movie started a whole thinking process, mainly wondering why Peter Jackson chose to make these changes. I went back to the book in my head, and tried to humbly create my personal version of the Two Towers movie. After a while, I went to see it again, and again, and again. And now I can honestly say that my initial reaction was wrong. This movie serves its purpose - it delivers the story to the movie audience in the most thrilling and moving way. Well done.
I suppose that several plotlines were moved to the next film for climactic reasons (Shelob, the confrontation with Saruman, the Palantir etc.) My guess is they will reappear on the Return of the King. Some were cut off for obvious production reasons - otherwise, the film would have been 7 hours long (really - are the Entwives really that important for the flow of the story?) And the rest of the changes were modified to perhaps change the somewhat non-climactic nature of large parts of the books, mainly the parts with Treebeard, Faramir, and Frodo and Sam.
In the book, the Treebeard sequence is slower and, well, feels less dangerous. Jackson added suspense and excitement to that. Frodo and Sam's journey is full of mostly uneventful travel and brilliant dialongs with Gollum. I hoped to have seen more of that dialog in the film, but the essence is there - the internal battle between Smeagol and Gollum and the slow deterioration of Frodo. Faramir's character was more positive in the book: I like the decision to make him darker and his trial by the Ring longer and more perilous to the Hobbits. And even though I resented that choice the most at first, I suppose a dark sequence such as the battle of Helm's Deep needs some comic relief delivered by Gimli.
All in all - I think Jackson and his team did an expert job cinematically speaking. Purists would frown, of course, but simply because the film is not EXACTLY what Tolkien wrote, doesn't mean that it's not a good film. The main plotlines are delivered extremely well, and even modernized to a point where it is appealing to 21st century audience. Lighten up people - Tolkien was not deflied here. The films' release caused a massive surge in the books' sales: people read the story as a result of the films. Tolkien is being promoted even with this action packed somewhat more commercial version of it. Many people are exposed to the beauty and poetry of Tolkien even if they think that they will read that Legolas made a ""Back to the Future"" orc-shield skateboard trick on the steps of Helm's Deep.",1053820800,4,2777,4.623481781376518

1466410,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson's second of three film versions of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is superb in many ways. As an adaptation of the book, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" this is as authentic as a film can get. Like its predecessor, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings"", this film blends the perfect degree of realism and fantasy so that the viewer is comfortably ensconced between the two. Like the Middle Earth of the books, the one in this film is believable, yet clearly an imaginary world.
The film picks up where its predecessor left off. The dark lord of a powerful evil empire launches multiple wars of aggression. In the process of doing this, he abrogates all the treaties that preserve the peace in Middle Earth, he destroys the environment, including living forests, for his short-term gain, and he deliberately targets civilians in his military campaign. The seemingly omnipotent dark lord possesses powerful weapons of mass destruction including an air force of invincible wraiths, artillery and mobile divisions of Orks and other insensate humanoids. Equally as powerful is his surveillance system, a large telepathic eye that provides him with total information awareness. Although his plans for global hegemony of Middle Earth really require no assistance, the dark lord allies himself with a formerly benign wizard who serves as the junior partner of his invasion plans. By the time the other nations of Middle Earth form a defensive alliance against the dark lord, it appears to be too late. Realizing that the only way to stop the evil leader is to destroy the ring of power, Frodo, Sam, and company head to Mount Doom in order to cast it into the flames from which it was forged. Realizing that he must prevent them from doing this, the dark lord launches a preemptive strike against Minas Tirath, and Gondor, with the eventual goal of conquering the third part of this axis, the Shire itself.
The battle scenes that follow are fantastic, and I won't describe them in detail for fear of giving anything away, but it is safe to say that they involve multiple simultaneous effects based operations whose purpose is to achieve rapid dominance. This film is entertaining, largely faithful to the text, and timely.",1053561600,2,2248,4.887434554973822

Characterizations, dialogue, secondary plots, locations; nothing has been spared the poisoned razor of the Jackson crew. While it may be a 'big' film (in that it cost a lot of money and has been widely hyped), it is a real disappointment in terms of what it could have delivered. The changes in The Two Towers are so significant, an extended edition will only further the bizarre and shallow changes that were made. As for the people that claim that they understand why P. Jackson made the changes, perhaps you could explain it to the people that don't. This isn't Tolkien's Middle-earth. It's Jackson's, and it should be stated as such. I'm waiting for a version that pays homage to the beauty of the book's original dialogue (among many other things), and not a film rife with modern Americanisms ('let's hunt some orc!' Argh!)

1466579,5,B00005JKZU,"The movie, not the book.
The book was good. All three books were good.
The movie was good, too, but not for the same reasons the books were good. That's because they're two different things.
Sorry, everyone, for the remedial class in the difference between book and movie, but it seemed necessary.
This was a really, really good movie. They did an excellent job of catching the character of Gollum who, along with Frodo and Sam, will be pivotal in the next movie. The actor's movements were excellent and the special effects team did a spectacular job of making his facial expressions match the actor.
The plot with Merry and Pippin was rather more watered down than I'd hoped it would be, but the Ents were there, and they were neat-looking, and they pummeled their way to Isengard with a ferocity that surprised me. It makes sense, and is very much like the book, but it was still shocking. One touch in the battle scene I particularly liked: the dam has just broken and orcs are floundering everywhere. One of the Ents is on fire and dives into the water, dousing itself. It's kind of down in the corner of the screen and hard to see, but it's a nice touch of realism in a fantasy movie.
The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli trek probably breaks most from the books, but it still had that ""battle at the edge of desperation"" feel to it, coupled with some good humour and scenes that leave you at the edge of your seat.

1466581,5,B00005JKZU,"I have been a huge fan of the book since I was 12. Two Towers differs from the book more than Fellowship and probably more than Return of the King will. Some of the changes at first glance make you do a double take. However as one examines them closer the reasons and motives are apparent and make sense when making a movie. Some deal with portraying something that happened in  the book in a different way. The Elves fighting for one. In the book they fight on their own front. However since this is not seen in the movie it would be good to show the elves involed. The other huge change was Faramir. However his change was inevitably set up int he first movie where all men, even Aragorn are tempted by the ring of power. Therefore to stay consistant one must also show Faramir as such.
This is a great great movie. It is different from the first as it is more spread out following different people and places. It is an excellent continuation of the Greatest story of our time. One can sit there and pick at it or sit back get lost and let the emotion, terror, and shear magnitude take you. It truely is a slendid sight.

1466583,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale.
The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai.
Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will.
While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for.
Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes.
But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words.
The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film.
Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camerawork and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering.
Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure. And they say ""Return of the King"" will be the best of all...",1052524800,121,4888,4.765330188679245

The war scenes are spectacular as well as the special effects. The way they made TreeBeard and Gollum are just unreal. You think you are watching real creatures not computer animation.

This movie is a triumph in adaptation from book to film.  Most people realize that you simply cannot put the level of detail (Tolkien's is extensive--I, too, have read him and love him) in a movie and make it commercially viable.  Understandably, some portions of the storyline have been altered to make the visual experience better and the plot clear enough for a non-reader to follow.
At the end of the movie, Gollum mentions bringing Sam and Frodo to ""her"" to be killed.  He is referring to Shelob, the great spider-like monster.  The portion of the story which includes her has been put in ""The Return of the King,"" not eliminated.
The collection of talent assembled for this trilogy is amazing.  All of the actors did excellent jobs and created a believable atmosphere of ""Middle Earth.""  The actors and actresses were selected for their resemblance to the characters described in the book, so their looks were appropriate.  There is still plenty of eye candy, though.  I thought Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and Karl Urban especially yummy.  The ladies were classy and attractive.  This cast is one of the best international groups assembled on one project.
The bottom line:  This is definitely a movie worth buying.  It's a keeper and will become a classic for sure.  Enjoy!",1052438400,2,1287,4.875576036866359
1466686,5,B00005JKZU,"...When you look at the history of hollywood and consider all major studio movies that were adapted from books, changes have always been made. Even with such movies as Gone With the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath ...Changes are sometimes necessary for the following reasons:
1. Budget constraints. This is already one of the most expensive movies ever made, you have to expect that the studio would like to earn some money from it.
2. Attention span of the average moviegoer. The movie is already quite lengthy for the average moviegoer, any longer and vivarin would be required with every ticket purchased. Today's children are not going to wait for intermissions (not spelled with an E).
3. An adaption is exactly as it sounds. The director adapts the movie using ""his creative direction"" as what would be best for the flow of the movie. Tolkkien did not have a movie in mind when he wrote these books.
This was one of the BEST movies of the 21st century to date (2000 - 2003) plain and simple, and the critics agree. If you are looking for an exact replica of the book, read the book. If you looking for a great movie with plenty of action and great story line, watch this movie!",1052438400,15,1180,4.544600938967136

In my 44 years I have only 1 other time actually paid out my very hard-earned money to go to the theater to see a movie more than once - even before the advent of video tapes - that was for Life is Beautiful. Mr. Jackson never claimed, nor even pretended, to make a completely faithful adaptation of the book. And I believe Mr. Tolkien would have thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation - by far more than the animated versions, but I guess that goes without saying!!!  I may not have read the books 37 times (YET) but I find that with each re-reading since watching the movies I so completely am engrossed with the literature that the movies serve only to aid my imaginations. I have to say a wholehearted THANK YOU to Mr. Jackson. I wish I could sit down with him and talk about these movies. THEY ARE SUPERB.",1052352000,10,974,4.180851063829787

What Mr. Jackson and the cast and crew involved in the making of the trilogy have done is nothing short of miraculous.  I have seen The Fellowship countless times and I will continue to watch it.  Some have said that this is the greatest movie of all times.  I fully agree. But, I must also add that The Two Towers is equal to The Fellowship.  I cannot wait for the Reteurn of the King.  Once the three movies are out, then we can truly say that this is the greatest work of all times.  There is no miscasting in the series.  I have tried to visualize other actors in these roles, it has been futile.  The cast is perfect, the settings are perfect, the music is perfect, and what can you say about the special effects. I cannot believe that the esteem Academy did see fit to give the Oscar to this effort.  The series seriously outclasses the competition not only visually but in every other aspect.  As a lifelong fan of the literary wonder of The Lord of the Ring, I cannot be less than that for Mr. Jackson's epic motion picture rendering.",1052352000,,1158,4.26605504587156

I am often disappointed with a director's chosen interpretation, but not so with The Two Towers, arguably the most difficult of the three books to film.  the story line is there, both continuing the thread from the first and existing on its own.

1466905,5,B00005JKZU,"I saw this movie in the theaters about a month after it was released.  I have read the books extensively, and all I can say about the film is pure magnificence.  It may not follow the book to the letter, but so what.  Name me one movie, with the exception of the 1st LOTR, that even comes close.  I'll give you 5 minutes to come up with a response............actually, forget that, because I have already thought about it, and can't find a single one.  One question, are you the same people who hate Disney films, cause they don't follow the story....anyways back to the review.  The cinematography was nearly flawless.  The direction superb.  And when you realize that Peter Jackson did a movie this technically amazing, and with this much depth for around $33 million a movie, well it kind of puts Titanic at $200 million, and Harry Potter at over $100 million a movie into perspective.  Peter Jackson is showing every director who has ever been given a smaller budget to make a ""Hollywood"" film, how to do it.  And also showing up most other directors who in essence throw away $100 million dollar budgets to make their own ""Hollywood"" movie....not naming any names *cough* Michael Bay *cough* Pearl Harbor *cough*.  The acting was top notch, and not exactly what you would expect from a cadre of semi-unknowns.  Not that they are independant film actors, but I would not call this ""Hollywoods"" A-List.  When imagining Gandalf and Aragorn, I think I always have seen Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen's type of actor in either roll.  An amazing job of casting.  So to summarize, all of you who have given this movie a bad rating because it did not follow the book, give it a rest and just try to enjoy the movie for the masterpiece that it is.",1052265600,16,1745,4.601941747572815
1466906,5,B00005JKZU,"I was spellbound by the previous Lord Of The Rings film, ""Fellowship Of The Ring"". The previous is more like an introduction to the characters of the trilogy. However, that one, as powerful, riveting, and astounding as ""Fellowship"" is, it is eclipsed by this second installment film in the three part trilogy ""The Two Towers"". The cast of this movie is perfect. The same held true with the previous as well. The thing that I found vastly improved was the grouchy dwarf Gimli. I wasn't fond of him as he seemed selfish, pompous and having a too big of an ego in the first LOTR movie but in the second LOTR movie, he was vastly improved in this movie. Gimli was much funnier expressed much more humor, and showed a much more heroic attitude to become one of the highlight characters in my opinion.
The whole imaginative world that J. R. Tolkien built in his mind would've put anything that George Lucas or Steven Spielberg would've imagined to shame. No pun intended. He made up entire languages, entire language accents, entire worlds, it goes on. He would've been impressed by the movie screen adaptations. No other novel that I've read has been so well adapted to the big screen like 'Lord Of The Rings' has and I doubt it'll be surpassed for a long time if ever. What I find amazing about the LOTR movies so far is that things that make most other fantasy movies rather cheesy sometimes, they add so much to this movies power and emotion especially the talk treelike people, the Ents.
Just trying to be able to put even a drop of the creativity that Tolkien had, onto the big screen seemed impossible but with the help of Peter Jackson, doing so succeeded in every way. Ian McKellen was perfect to play Gandalf. I especially find it wonderful to see the husky voiced Christopher Lee play the renegade wizard Saruman. Saruman is even more evil than he was in the last movie. The visuals are amazing especially with the Sauron's Eye, and the lightning above Mt. Doom, as well as the bird's eye view of Saruman's Orthanc Tower and the Gates of Mordor and also the schizophrenic creature Gollum. Gollum is the spotlight character on this stunning masterpiece of a movie. First, he is a completely computer generated creature but the way they created his form on computer is cutting edge and groundbreaking computer generated imaging. To me, its this that makes Gollum the most intriguing character in the movie. Its also the dangerously conflicting personalities within him and no other computer generated character in any movie showed so much expression like Gollum does. Its hard not to show at least a little pity for his painful life with the Ring.
Picking up where ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" left off where Frodo and Samwise were when they saw the fiery Mount Doom, the two run into the alienish looking creature Gollum, a former Hobbit named Smagol, who found the Ring after it being lost and forgotten for thousands of years and being tormented by it's power for hundreds of years before Bilbo Baggins found it after Gollum lost it and Frodo now had the ring and is on his bid to destroy it in the fires of Mt. Doom but encounters Gollum, the one who found it after it was lost for thousands of years. Due to the permanent mental poisoning caused by the ring and his experience of the rings power, not to mention that he seems to suffer from schizophrenia, he guides Frodo & Samwise (who does not trust Gollum) towards the fiery Mt. Doom. At the same time, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli hunt down orcs that captured Pippin & Merry during the battle that claimed the life of Borimir in the last movie and involved the Fellowship being dispersed with Frodo going on his own. The two hobbits escape the orcs though and what lies ahead for them is well, let's just say, out of this world.
This movie isn't without its flaws though. There are a great deal of changes that were done to the storylines that made a small number of people disappointed. There are also a large number of characters who aren't even shown on the movie and it disappointed a small number of fans. Overall though, The Two Towers surpasses the first on almost all fronts and the flaws done to this movie are so overshadowed by the incredible dialog and emotions that its forgivable as there are so many books, events, and characters to play that its completely impossible to put everything from the book onto the big screen without making each individual movie at least 5 and a half hours long! Theres just no way that could happen. The same holds true with Fellowship Of The Ring. The books have a lot more scenes and images that the movies do but the movies absolutely succeeded in portraying the major battle scenes from the books.
There are quite a few scenes in the movie that will tug at your heart strings and make one feel bad but its a mere taste of the sadness that real life events cause when evil strikes home and societies. To me, that makes the Lord Of The Rings movies so incredibly moving and touching and parallels the dangers our world faces these days.
As for the DVD release, I would like to warn that whenever the DVD is first released, I would recommend holding off as possibly a gift set or extended edition might wind up surfacing later on so if the regular edition comes out, HOLD OFF, and wait until an extended or gift set edition comes out so you don't get duped by the marketing ploys. This is especially true of the first LOTR movie and it might become of this movie too so I just wanted to deliver a fair warning.
Anyhow, back to the movie, TTT is a spellbinding masterpiece and its a humongous crime that it only won one Academy Award!
All I can do now is try to keep myself entertained as I now begin the excruciating wait for the cataclysmic finale 'Return of the King' and witness the final battle to save Middle Earth from the evil clutches of Sauron.

1467026,4,B00005JKZU,"Though and outstanding movie, the ""Two Towers"" fails somewhat when compared to the first.  Unlike ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" the movie departs - quite drastically at times - in several places.  In retrospect, it would have worked out better had Peter Jackson stayed closer to the book, in both a theatrical and dramatic sense.
The first major departure was the activity of Treebeard, and the debate of the Ents.  In the movie, Pippen and Merry convince Treebeard to take them close to Saruman's stronghold, where Treebeard sees the devastation of Orthanac and the surrounding forest.  The whole scene plays pretty hokie.
In the book, Treebeard is already considering action against Saruman - Pippen and Merry simply give him a nudge over the edge, so to speak.  All in all, the movie version comes off pretty bad.
The encounter with Faramir is another departure that would have been done better had it followed the book.  Faramir is a poingant counterpoint to his brother Boromir, and is not corrupted by the lure of the Ring's power.  He let's Frodo and Sam go.  In the movie, he drags them to daddy.
Some of the character development begins to unravel in the second movie as well.  Aragorn's portrayal is weakend by the loss of Boromir (mainly because the two actors plying the respective parts are good, and work well off of one another).  Galadriel gets more and more bizzare in her actions (the whole ""witchy-elf"" couunterpoint that Jackson puts in goes a bit too far).  Pippen and Merry end up looking more like communist revolutionaries then meek hobbits.
Also, much of the weaknesses of the first movie are carried off into the second.  Much of the acting is too staged, phoney, or the timing is rushed.  Some actions and dialog seem overblown or ""overtly"" heroic.
However, many of the new characters introduced are very well done.  Theoden is well acted and well scripted, as are Grima Wormtongue, and Eowyn (who's quite hot, I might add).  Arwen plays more prominatly in this installment as well (see ""hot"" comment above) and much of the tension and turmoil within the mind and soul of Aragorn is explained as well.  Gollum is extremely well written and played.  They did a pretty good job with Treebeard, in addition to providing more ""comic"" exposure for Gimli as well.
I recommend buy the extended edition of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" before getting this installment.",1051747200,16,2386,4.851851851851852
1467027,4,B00005JKZU,"After seeing the Fellowship of the Rings, I couldn't wait for Two Towers to come out, and was pleasantly pleased when our local cinema decided to show the first movie (7 pm) followed by the Two Towers at midnight.
The movie itself is overwhelming. Like the first one, the viewer is bombarded with gorgeous scenery, beautifully constructed costumes, amazing CGI (at times you cannot tell the difference between what's real and what's not), and a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat for nearly three hours.
The story picks up where the first one left. In short: Merry and Pippin got abducted by Saruman's Uruk-Hai Orcs. Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are in close pursuit to try and free them, while Frodo and Sam make their way into the land of Mordor, after a while being escorted by the creature Gollum.
The book is (again) closely followed, but not too closely for my liking. Peter Jackson strayed from the original storyline at a few points, but personally, I fail to see why.
For instance, there's a little substory in which Arwen decides (or is forced) to leave for the Grey Shores. This was unneccessary, and the way in which she is shown to be departing is just painfull, and unworthy of her character. I'm sure it will be fixed in the third movie, but still. Why not stick to the book?
Same thing with Aragorn falling down a cliff. It doesn't really add anything to the story, and it would have been just as easy to follow the book.
Worse is when Jackson actually makes Frodo being abducted by Faramir. In the book, Faramir is a very noble man, who releases Frodo almost straight away. In the movie, he's more made out like a rogue who wants to hand Frodo over to his father, for personal gain. And Frodo showing the ring to the Nazgul is just plain outrageous.
Another little peeve I had was that for an hour and a half, the battle at Helm's Deep is prepared. You see armies marching, defenses being built up, and for an hour and a half, you're kept at the very edge of your seat.
And then within 5 minutes or so, everything is over. The long build-up (which was done extremely well) just ends like that. Jackson could have taken a few more minutes to make it just a tad more spectacular than it turned out.
All in all, still 4 stars, as Jackson DOES correct his 'straying' by the end of the movie, and being carried off to Middle Earth to see all your favourite characters in their natural surroundings is just as wonderfull as it was the very first time.
I'm anxiously awaiting the Return of the King!",1051488000,16,2522,4.461038961038961

1467029,4,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is a spectacular looking movie.  The visual effects have surpassed that of ""Fellowship.""  The computer generated Gollum is worth the price of admission alone.  The movie, based on its own merits, is great.
However, this movie is based on one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and the liberties that Peter Jackson takes with ""The Two Towers"" ultimately detracts from Tolkien's masterpiece.  I understand the constraints of adopting a novel into a movie.  The liberties Jackson took with ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were understandable and kept the essence of the novel.  In the sequel, some of the changes were not necessary.  I was very disappointed with the portrayals of Faramir and Treebeard.  In the book, Faramir is portrayed as being more noble than his brother, Boromir.  In the movie, though, Faramir is shown as not being any better than Boromir.  It isn't until after Faramir has already taken Frodo to Gondor (just one of the plot liberties that irked me) does Faramir become the noble man in the book.  Treebeard is my favorite minor character in the trilogy.  Treebread and the Ents are portrayed as being relunctant to fight Saruman and need tricked by one of the Hobbits to fight back.  The Ents in the book need no persuasion.  These and a few other plot diversions left me disappointed with the movie, in regards to the book.
""The Two Towers"" is a great movie, don't get me wrong, if you haven't read the book or can forget about it until the movie is over.",1051488000,20,1497,4.72972972972973

1467170,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie overwhelmed me in every way. It was quite simply the most fantastic film of 2002. It also beats out it's predecessor, The Fellowship Of The Ring, and that movie was brilliant as well. There is so much to enjoy in this movie, and though it is rip-roaringly entertaining, it also brings much intensity and subtlety to the story, so we care about the outcome of events and what happens to the characters. I am a reviewer who hasn't yet read the books (though some day I hope I have the patience to read the apparently brilliant works of Tolkien) so I am finding the story unpredictable and amazing as it goes along. If you're looking for a reviewer who knows what happens in the long run, then go down the page more and find one. I'm reviewing the movie, not the book.
The thing that makes The Two Towers a masterpiece is its amazing ability to mix stunning how-...-did-they-do-that action sequences while also bringing us closer to the characters and making them more developed. The battle at Helms Deep is the most intense, amazingly produced and brilliant action sequence we're likely to see this decade. And wasn't it amazing how the writers managed to develop Arwen (Liv Tyler) further than they did in the first movie in a matter of about 7 MINUTES? An amazing achievement. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have to work together and their faith is also developed and questioned throughout the feature. Frodo is being more drawn into the ring and Sam is becoming more than the companion. All of these things are acted very well, and the character developments brilliant, but it's none of these characters who are developed the most in this movie. In fact, the character who we explore most in TTT wasn't even in the first movie -
GOLLUM. He is an amazing character. Andy Serkis did much of his scenes himself before they were visualed up, and he deserves a Best Supporting Actor award at any ceremony this year. He was just incredible! He made Gollum a threatening but also loveable and sympathetic character to indentify with. It's also noted that the movie's best scene is obviously Gollum/Smeagol's conversation - this is the most character developing scene of any movie so far in 2002. What an amazing scene!
That scene is also followed up for ""BEST TTT SCENE"" by Legolas so cooly jumping on a horse just before battle (see it to believe it), Gandalf getting Saruman out of King Theodon and obviously the battle at Helm's Deep, which will most definitely go down in history as one of the most amazing sequences ever put to film.
Almost everything about TTT is better than FOTR - more action, better acting, better special effects and much better writing. All of these elements combined make a modern classic. The music is also much better here, and the Celtan quality to the Rohan theme is awesome. If you're one of the, say, about, 5 PEOPLE, who hasn't seen this amazing piece of film yet - rush to your local multiplex NOW.

1467171,5,B00005JKZU,"On December 18, 2002, I was at the movie theatre to see the opening of The Two Towers. Being a Tolkien fan, I feel that movie adaptations are usually [bad], because they stray so far from the books. After seeing what Jackson did with Fellowship, I had high hopes for the Two Towers.
Tolkien fans/purists will understand me when I say that my jaw dropped to the floor when the Elves showed up at Helm's Deep, Faramir said, ""The ring will go to Gondor,"" and when the Ents decided not to go to war, and then 'hastily' changed their minds at the last minute. To those of you unfamiliar with the novels, I'll just say that these three events occurred exactly the opposite in the movie of the way they occurred in the book.
I was put out, and rather distraught with Two Towers having seen the amazing degree to which Jackson had adapted Fellowship. Certainly, the first movie left out parts of the book, but other than the minor character change (Glorfindel/Arwen), I don't remember things happening exactly opposite to the way they did in the book. I felt like the few things that Jackson left out and omitted in the first movie did not change the themes from Tolkien's work, whereas the changes in The Two Towers did.
However, after seeing The Two Towers a second time, then a third time, and finally a fourth time, my opinions have changed. I realized that the movie adaptation was just that: an adaptation, not a photocopy of the book put onto film. I also realized that the things changed only changed temporarily, not permanently.
In The Lord of the Rings books, Tolkien has nearly 2000 pages (not including appendices) to completely develop his characters. Characters are made interesting by the degree to which they change. That being said, Tolkien's character's dynamism is far more subtle than Jackson's, but that is simply the way a movie works: the action is much quicker than in a book.
When Faramir decides to take the ring, I thought his character was ruined...but then I changed my mind. In order to emphasize Faramir's doubt and final resolution, they had him change his mind after a great conflict. In the end, his character has the same mindset as Faramir's character has in the book. In the book, Tolkien emphasizes that the time of the Elves is over, and that the age of men is soon to begin. Thus, he has them win the Battle of Helm's deep by themselves (not outnumbered too terribly). When I first saw the elves at Helm's deep, I thought that that emphasis on the strength of men was ruined. But, if you look closely, there are no elves left in the morning...only the men lasted the night, and only the men led the final charge that won the battle. And, also, if you go back and read the books, the Ents do change their minds rather quickly, and they do resolve at first (at entmoot) not to go to war.
Purists: remember, it's not the books. It's a movie. And, the movie does a darned good job of emphasizing the themes of the book; it just employs different devices to obtain that emphasis. From a Tolkien fan's standpoint, The Two Towers was just as good as The Fellowship of the Ring. From a movie standpoint, this one was far better than the first. It has action, suspense, comic relief, drama, romance, and the best musical score of 2002. The acting and cinematography are brilliant: Jackson will go down in history as one of the greatest directors ever. With Fellowship, I was a purist, and I still am. But this movie is pure: pure movie-making genius. Tolkien is smiling in the Valinor...",1051228800,17,3511,4.574603174603174

1467246,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers, is one of the best cinema experiences I had in years, and proves to be more than a worthy sequel to the Fellowship, and this is coming from someone who has never read Tolkein, and no idea about the story and the sometimes confusing characters and names.
Nevertheless, it was mind boggling experience, a feast to my senses..Over three hours passed by as mere minutes, and by the end,I wanted more!
I think the biggest surprise of the Lord of the Rings franchise is the director Peter Jackson,
a New Zealander with a CV and style that can be best described as a cross between a funnier Cronenberg and a more subdued Waters, with films like Bad Taste, The Frighteners and heavenly Creatures, and suddenly he unleashes on the world the best movie trilogy since Star Wars in the late 70s.
I don't know whether the films would have come out the same with another director, but with Jackson he proves to be one of the most talented directors in the business today.
To be able to handle Tolkein is no easy task, yet to be able to film all the trilogy back to back with such technical,visual and scriptual command, is the result of undeniable strong talent.
Another aspect about the first two Lord of the Ring films, is the scenery! It is simply breathtaking. The New Zealand Tourist board is undoubtedly eternally grateful to Jackon to have provided them the best advertisement they can ever wish for. But the scenery is not merely a background series of postcards, it is rather an integral part of the film, and not since films like Deliverance or Black Robe, did the scenery play an important role in the story telling.
The final aspect I want to talk about is the end scene, The final battle.
With my over twenty years of avid movie watching, I can safely say that it is by far the best battle scene ever filmed!
It is mind boggling, using a combination of extras and digital trickery.
I can not wait for the third installement The Return of the King, and although i am going to be the first to buy The Fellowship when it is released on DVD, I too know that eventually the whole trilogy will be released as one package with so many extras, making it an essential buy of what is one of the best movie experiences of all time.",1050883200,2,2254,4.446859903381642

1467364,5,B00005JKZU,"I liked how the movie began with Gandalf fighting the Balrog and ended with the victory over the Uruk-Hai at Helms Deep with the help of Gandalf and the Rohirrim led by Theoden's nephew.
The fellowship was already broken up with the fall of Gandalf, Boromir's death, and the capture of the two young hobbits by an evil group of orcs and Uruk-Hai.  Frodo and Sam began their lonely quest until a very creepy, hateful, evil creature showed up at night.  His name is Gollum. But his real name was Smeagol, who was once a hobbit of the Stoor tribe.  He claimed  the ring after he had killed his cousin, Deagol over 500 years ago.  Frodo made him his servant who could guide them to Mordor, a barren wasteland of volcanos, fire, sewage, and ugly buildings such as the tower of Barad-dur.
Trouble comes to Rohan once Saruman put its king Theoden under his control so as to render ineffective to rule or to do anything for that matter.  Grima Wormtongue was Theoden's advisor to the king as well as a paid spy and servant to the evil Saruman at Isengard, which is not that far from Rohan.  Saruman wants to take the ring for himself and to become the master of Middle Earth, but Gandalf, coming clean from victory over the Balrog, is stronger than he and that he released the king from Saruman, thereby frustrating his plans of control.  It's not over yet, for Saruman had amass an army of ugly, brutal Uruk-Hai who could destroy Rohan and the rest of Middle Earth.  It's genocide in the extreme.
I could go on and on about this powerful, but disturbing movie.  Time wouldn't allow me to do so. I cannot wait to see it on video and I'm aching to see the extended version as well.  Thanks, Peter Jackson, for bringing Tolkien's books to life.",1050537600,,1734,4.455696202531645
1467499,5,B00005JKZU,"In 1994, when Houghton Mifflin Company published a single copy of The Lord of The Rings, Douglas A. Anderson wrote a `revised note to the text' making it clear that J. R. R. Tolkien's famous epic novel was ""often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes"".  The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings).  According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume.  Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself.  However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.
All of this background is not for won't when reviewing Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of The Rings:  The Two Towers. In spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second.  The Two Towers immediately picks up right where the Fellowship of The Ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced.  The Two Towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to Mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron and the traitorous Saruman.  New characters are introduced, notably the Ents, Grima Wormtongue, King Theodon and the creature Gollum.
The film is undoubtedly mythical, just as Tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions Tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests.  In many ways Gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder.
It is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that Jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had.",1050192000,5,3389,4.940246045694201

1467768,5,B00005JKZU,"I've been reading and re-reading these books for years.  And when I heard they were shooting the entire trilogy I was very excited; I was also very concerned with the second one.  Mainly, my preoccupation was that the role of this book (in Tolkien's original conception of one book and not three) as the middle chapters would not make a very interesting movie; I thought it would be scattered and a little bit flat, not having a real conclusion or a beginning for that matter.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it carries the story very well.
  Mr. Jackson and Company outdid themselves visually for this one, not to mention the stellar portrayal of Gollum by Andy Serkis in of the most interesting roles in cinematic history.  Forget the visual effects for this character, the movements and especially the voice work of Mr. Serkis take you on an unprecedented trip.  Mr. Jackson uses Gollum brilliantly to convey the cold and dark soul of book.  There is so much to mention about this movie, not in the least how the visual effects, cinematography and photography surpass the already masterful touch of the first movie.  To say that the battles scenes are simply impressive is an severe understatement.
  Now I'm looking forward, more than ever, to the Special Extended Edition DVD release in November.  And I can't wait to see the conclusion to the trilogy in December.  this is an excellent movie, even if you're not a Tolkien fan, but you like good cinema, you will find this a highly entertaining movie experience.
  Thanks again to Mr. Jackson and Company for this labour of love.  Blood, sweat and tears is only a small price to pay for the cinematic event of the turn of the millenium.

For those who know maintain the rage because we know that beauty is in the details and for the others, read the book so you too can tell the difference.",1049500800,15,854,4.041420118343195
1467771,4,B00005JKZU,"Being an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy I delightfully snapped up a ticket for the opening night in Austraila, I am not deying that this is an excellent movie and I greatly look forward to the Return of the King. But while I enjoyed the movie a great deal, the changes made to the story slacken the wind in it's sails a bit for me.
There are scores of minor details which were changed for no apparent reason, especially in the unfolding of the battle for Helms Deep, these include;
- Eomer off fighting in the north when he in fact was behind the wall fighting along side Aragorn, which played importantly in the true story by serving to further the friendship which develops between these two. It was also Eomer who accompanied Aragorn to the outside of the Hornburgh to fight off the orcs assailing the gate, Gimli was there unbeknown to them until he saved the two when they turned to retreat and were grabbed from behind.
- Gimli retreating from the wall to the Hornburgh tower, when he retreated to the caves amidst the thick of the fighting. Furthermore the way that the character of Gimli has been changed for him to serve simply as comedy relief I think is an affront to the courageous dwarf which is portrayed in Tolkien's masterpiece.
- The Ents and their part in the conflict was the most drastically changed part of this battle. For starters the Ents agreed to help in the struggle after the Entmoot, and in the original story the Ents lead a force of Hurons (these are wild and violent tree-creatures who the Ents sort of govern over) to block off the entrance of the ravine containing the deep. Then at dawn when the horn of the deep is blown and the king rides out to meet the Orcs while Gandalf arrives with forces from the north to assail the beseigers flank, the Orcs retreat only to find this forest blocking their way. In a panic they wildy try to retreat at a run through it, all of them once disappearing under the dark canopy of the forest never to come out again. I agree with what has been said in a lot of other reviews, the Ents seem to have been dumbed down from the old and wise creatures which they are in the book.
Now the translation of this literary masterpiece to cinema is no meagre task, yet I am left aghast wondering why Peter Jackson chose to change so many details seemingly for no reason and to add whole scenes which never occur in the book at the exclusion of pieces of the original story.
What am I talking about you ask? I am talking about the time wasted furthering the love story between Aragron and Arwen, along side the added in scenes of Frodo and Sam being taken to Osgilliath by Faramir and Aragorn being lost persumed dead. These scenes do nothing to further the story and were not part of the original tale yet they have been created and thrown in, why do you ask? Well only Jackson himself can answer that one. I mean we have these completely newly created scenes put in place which waste time which could have been used better. How do you ask? Well the movie was cut short, it ends with the two sides of Gollum plotting to do away with Sam and Frodo. Yet this is quite a way from the end of the book which concludes with the climatic cliffhanger involving Shelob, I'm not going to detail it here though, don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the book. This was my supreme disappointment with the movie, I could overlook all the other changes but the story being cut short really bit it in the tail for me  because it just made the movie feel incomplete. I oh so wanted to see the visual rendering of Shelob, but I guess I'll have to wait now. Further this clifhanger would have made for a much more grander ending I beleive, and cutting it short is the worst decision PJ made with this film.
I know there are people who have been telling us 'Tolkein Purists' to stop complaining in their reviews, well I say that just as they are entitled to their opinion I am also entitled to mine and this is it;
Aside from the many changes to the core story, it is undeniable that The Two Towers is an excellent film and a good continuation of the series, the cinematography is beautiful, the effects, particularly the rendering of Gollum are astounding and the musical score powerful and moving. For those who haven't read the books it will be an excellent watch, but may be a wee bit of a disappointment for those who were hoping for a more accurate adaptation.
***Interesting facts about The Two Towers***
- To get the sound effects for the army of Orcs attacking Helms Deep Peter Jackson himself and a sound team went to a cricket match in New Zealand and during the innings changeover they set up a recording rig and PJ led the crowd in series off hollaring, raving, chanting and foot stomping.
- There was an organisation started up in America before the movies release which partitioned for the name to be changed from 'The Two Towers'. Totally ignoring the fact that this part of the story has been named  The Two Towers for nearly 60 years, they claimed that the movie was only being called The Two Towers to garnish hype from the tragic events of 9/11. They even have a website up. Just do a google search on ""The Two Towers name change"" or something along those lines to find their site, look closely, this is an excellent example of hyper sensitiviy and crackpot thinking in contemporary times.",1049500800,,5372,4.414314516129032

1467913,2,B00005JKZU,"I respect opinions. I got 'em, you all got 'em. I did not care for this movie, many of you will care for it. That is fine and peachy. Opinions!
... It demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of what Tolkien was attempting to achieve with the LOTR trilogy. So far, the movies have been created with the same misunderstanding.
Tolkien wrote a myth-history of England because, through various historical circumstances, England lacked one. Admiring the Kalevala, Beowulf and other historical ""sagas"", Tolkien wrote the LOTR as a substitute for England's own myth-histories.
Key to building this history are three things 1) sense of place, 2) sense of character and 3) sense of time [continuity]. Tolkien went to painstaking lengths to ensure that all of these were achieved. His narrative is truly a marvel of character development, pacing, interleaving of storylines and time scales, and language. To Tolkien that last is the most important: Tolkien was a philologist, and believed that a culture was defined by its language and that words had emotional vibrations associated with them, whether you understood them or not. That is a subject for another review.
Book to movie translation aside for the moment, The Two Towers fails to communicate Tolkiens original intentions for all three of the above. The sense of place is gone: Jackson far too often dwells on close-ups, particularly in interiors. The beauty that Tolkien finds in many of his settings is all but gone in the movie; Meduseld is a dark, grimy stable robbed of any majesty. The majesty that is leeched from Tolkien's places is also leeched from his characters. The sense of character that Tolkien excels out is non-existent in these movies, with Legolas and Gandalf the only two characters still left with a portion of the grace Toklien gifted them (and for that I applaud the actors, not Jackson). Faramir is not Tolkien's Faramir, Treebeard bears no resemblance to Tolkien's Ent, and Theoden is practically detestable, a whiny and sniveling coward. Third, sense of time. The movie is a narrative mess. Granted, there is much to include, much to cut. The book is far too long to translate word for word onto the screen. But we still find hackneyed scenes written in: the Warg battle is a trite, narrative-flow killing mess. The whole romantic interlude flashback/flash forward is a heavy handed and interruptive attempt to set-up a plot line not at all essential to the story at hand (hint: Tolkien left it out, leaving it for the appendices). We never get the sense of time and distance that Tolkien pulls off so adeptly.
As for translating books to scripts to screen. To the defenders of the Two Towers: you are right, it is an extremely difficult undertaking. But I will say this again: there are certain things in the source material that MUST be preserved. That is why it is the source material, and that is why the name of the book is riding on the opening credits. Consideration must be payed to the source material, especially when it is a 50 year old book that has been studied from stem to stern and rightly considered the most influential book of the century. Consideration must be paid to the fact that Tolkien was an accomplished writer and perfectionist, and intended every single line and plot point to be exactly as he wrote it. The success of his books are evidence enough that he knew what he was doing. To honor the man, you must honor his material, and Jackson et. al. fail so completely, I would say it borders on mockery (albeit non-intentional). Perhaps they are unable to understand Tolkien, ..., perhaps too many cooks, etc etc etc. ... It could be strongly argued that the Two Towers is that movie: in name only does this movie allude to the Two Towers I know, and is an affront to Tolkien's (Tolkien's mind you, not mine) original vision.
If Tolkien were alive, I am quite certain that these movies would not have been made.",1049241600,10,3916,4.820208023774145
1467914,4,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" is a direct sequel to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" without any prologue, flashback or ""Previously on"" footage. It opens up with an aerial view of the Misty Mountains (the same footage that was used when Gandalf fled from Orthanc on the giant eagle). This confused me at first. ""What, they chose to go back into the mountains to look for Gandalf's hat""?
""The Two Towers"" is nowhere near as good as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and it is also very different from the book, but it's still a great movie. Peter Jackson wanted a trilogy, no actually one single movie broken into three, but a trilogy nonetheless (no one would be able to watch a movie that was 9 hours long). Peter also wanted each movie to be different from the others. So, ""The Fellowship of the King"" was a kind of introduction into everything. You got to see lots of people, races, monsters, locations and so on and so on. ""The Two Towers"" was the part where you got to see the Power of the ring, how it could turn people (Saruman) evil and what it was capable of bringing forth (the battle of Helms Deep). ""The Two Towers"" is also the movie of character development for all of the Fellowship members besides Frodo (he was the centre of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"") and Boromir (well, he's dead). Let's just hope that ""The Return of the King"" is better than both ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" and that it'll win the Oscar for ""Best picture 2003"".
Now, as for the changes in the movie. Some were for the better, others for the worse, at least for those who have read the books. Being someone who hasn't read the books, I can still say that ""The Two Towers"" is a great movie, in the sense of that it's a movie based loosely on a book.
Also, in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", the music made a big difference. For example, the drama of Gandalf's ""death"" combined with the last part of ""The Bridge of Khazam-Dm"" made me cry... several times. However, in ""The Two Towers"", most of the songs, much like in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret"" are just variations and continuations of the songs of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
All in all, ""The Two Towers"" is a great movie that's worth seeing. I camped out in the Swedish winter cold for 3 days for tickets to the 00.01 premiere and I wasn't disappointed.",1049241600,,2304,4.398126463700234

1467916,4,B00005JKZU,"Okay, let me start off that I'm NOT a Tolkien purist! I love Tolkien's work and I think Peter Jackson is doing a wonderful job with the movies.
Alright, now to be honest I was a little disappointed with the Two Towers--only with ONE thing! And that was Treebeard...I really wished Peter shouldn't have changed Treebeard because I really loved Treebeard in the book! And to much of my surprise I was shocked that they changed Treebeard. Oh well, it's been done and there's nothing I can do about it.
Anyway, I'll get on with my review.
From the beginning to the end of the movie...I was just so amazed. I loved it all except for the Treebeard part, I was so disappointed. But I loved the Frodo and Sam, Elijah Wood did another wonderful job as Frodo. He's getting more drawn to the ring and Sam's trying his best to keep Frodo to his senses. Then there's Gollum--and he's no where near being another Jar Jar Brinks! Who would do a better job than Andy Serkis? I thought Andy was brillant and he seemed to do the role of Gollum perfectly. I never had a good image of Gollum but the sound of his voice is how Andy did in the movie.
  Then the Helm's Deep battle...wow. I was just blown away with all the action and all those Uruk-hai. Took them five days to do that scene of Helm's Deep and wow, what a battle!
The music in Two Towers is absolutely beautiful! I bought the OST a few days after I seen the movie.
Well I really can't think of what else to put but all I can say that this movie was wonderful and I've only seen it twice in theaters. Although when it comes out on DVD I'm definity buying it and watching it as many times I can. I've watched Fellowship of the Ring on DVD and the extended dvd version so many times I lost count.

There are a significant number of deviations from the book in this movie but 1)Not for a second was the continuity or the context broken, and 2)It actually meant that somebody who has memorised the book from cover to cover was left in suspense. This movie stays in your mind for days after it was viewed. The battle scenes were brilliant. The Black riders managed to look sacrier on their new steeds. Frodo is developing confidence, as the power of the Ring takes hold. When you see Gollum you actually and truly understand what a wretched creature he is, and why Bilbo could not slay him when he had the chance. Just for these bits alone, I praise the director to the sky. The deviations from the story are too numerous to count:
Theoden is 'possessed' by Saruman, not just fooled by Wormtongue's lies (which makes it seem more beliveable)
Faramir is not 'good' as portrayed in the book, but I felt this was necessary to bring home why frodo wanted to avoid men and go off on his quest alone, and also show the what troubled times everyone was living in and the lack of trust existing among all people. The addition of the Arwen and Aragorn story also gives both of them some charcter, and is necessary as you are trying to capture the film audience. But not for a second did it seem out of place. Overall the movie was much much better than the first and there was so much more action. The only complaint I have is that it should have ended like the book did with Shelob's Lair....because now it leaves me worried and anxious considering there are only 3 more hours left - what will be cut, and what won't?
I took a friend of mine along who had only seen the film version of Fellowship of the Ring (and not read any of LOTR) and she just positively loved this part, and like billions of other people around world, is awaiting the final installment",1049068800,8,2114,4.368020304568528

1468087,5,B00005JKZU,"I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.  I also love the films, but the first had some ""transformations"" that I did not agree with.  The Fellowship did not give enough character information on all of the characters: like Sam, Aragorn, and Merrry and Pippin.  I think Jackson simplified their characters too much to make Frodo seem more important.  This is contrary to Tolkien's work.  His work is the antithesis of all the hero stories where there is one main hero, who does everything.  Tolkien has many heroes in many forms.  The Ents are heros.  Aragorn and Sam.  Gimli and Legolas.  NOT just Frodo.  It is not just him saving the world. It is everyone's actions combined.
Jackson I am glad to say corrected his few errors in the magnificent Two Towers.  He gave every character there due and made Merry and Pippin like they should have been in the first movie.
The one thing that Jackson and his crew changed that I agreed with was giving Arwen and Aragorn's romance a bigger presence.  It made the movie all the more profound and enjoyable.
Jackson and his crew did the impossible with creating Gollum and the Ents to perfection without making them seem funny or fake.
THERE was one change that diminished the film for me.  Jackson changed Faramir's character and took away his goodness and purpose by making him just like his brother.  When in reality he lets Frodo and Sam go and proves he is a better person than Boromir.  Also that men can resist the ring's power.  The Two Towers is better than Fellowship but has it very few flaws.
This movie expands Tolkien's universe like the first could not as a film.  It may not be completely loyal to Tolkien but made that up in the character development all the way around.  It is beautifully shot and acted.  The score is grand and sad just like the book.  Viggo Mortensen once again proved he is ARAGORN.  Sean Astin was given the time to show the true and pure spirit that is SAMWISE.  Gollum and Treebead need I say more.
Jackson has proven again that Tolkien can be adapted.  He did some things wrong, but overall he gave the viewer a glimpse into the world of Tolkien.  These are hard novels to adapt and sometimes I cannot believe they were transfered as well as they were.
Jackson shows a small piece of Tolkien, but to truly experience and appreciate Tolkien you must read the books.  They are amazing and there is nothing like them in literature.",1048636800,13,2421,4.52073732718894

1468090,3,B00005JKZU,"...In the first movie, I completely understood why Tom Bombadil had to be left out, sad as it was. That is a scene which even in the book is rather isolated and ultimately has little to do with the advancement of the plot.
 Why, then, did you choose to make changes in the Two Towers which not only were very contrary to the spirit of the involved characters, but actually SLOWED THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLOT DOWN!!? If Faramir had behaved as intelligent and honorable as his character was written to be, poor Frodo and Sam wouldn't have had to spend half of the movie going to some place in which, in Sam's own scripted words ""everything feels wrong. We're not supposed to be here!"" Faramir is much more in control of himself than Boromir. He understands the peril of the ring, and decides to let the hobbits continue on their duty... he NEVER TAKES THEM ANYWHERE AGAINST THEIR WILL!!!
 The Ents... they have the Entmoot and decide, eventually, that they are very, terrifyingly, angry with Saruman, and they also decide to go after him. Forcefully. Treebeard is not tricked like some weak foolish old man into ""walking by"" Isengard. The march of the Ents is ferocious and implacable. Not delayed.
 It would actually have allowed you to make it a tighter and more accurate movie to stick closer to the book in at least those two respects. Instead what we have is an oddly timed movie that takes too long to get to the conclusion... which unfortunately, due to time constraints, was left for the beginning of the third movie. God knows how you're going to have to mangle the third book to finish the movie now. The scouring of the Shire is a shining moment in most fans minds... if that is left out, you will have completely disregarded the love Tolkein had for his characters.

I don't think I'll change many peoples mind but being a historian and a fencer (sword fighter), I want to point out that the film was tactically a bunch of rot.  ... First of all the arrows.  I don't know what [person] was in charge of the films tactics department.  I suspect they didn't have one.  Am I the only one who's noticed that it take four slashes with a sword to kill somebody and one shot with an arrow?  In reality it is the other way around.  One hit with the sword would more likely kill a man than one hit with an arrow.  ...  Ever notice how the dragon only took one shot to send it running?  Why was everybody so scared of it?  Why didn't they just take one simple shot at it and get back to their lives.  Hitting that thing isn't tough to do.  Next.  Archery tactics.  The English sometimes began shooting at an enemy at ranges of a quarter mile, and the elves begin shooting at the last possible moment?  Remember the battle of Helmsdeep?  Next.  When the short hand held ladders went up to the castle, why didn't anybody try pushing one off?  ...  They just stood at the top of the ladder and waited politely for their enemies to climb up.  Next the big ladders: that contraption to hook it to the wall has to be one of the world's stupidest things.  Number one the chances of firing that grappling hook up and hooking it just on the wall is probably mathematically a zero.  Second the chance that one elf or human won't cut the rope that holds the grappling hook to the ladder is absolutely nothing.  (I'm just getting started here!)  The explosion that blew out the wall.  Am I the only one who noticed they picked the absolute worst place to waste on explosion?  Why not set the explosion against the base of the keep?  If you look closely the outer wall did not defend the base of the keep; and the orkii had already reached the base of the keep they could have one the battle right there!  ...  Next when the horses charged out of the castle to meat Gandalf the horses had no armor?!  And not one of them went down!  What kind of code of honor do you think orkii have to not slash out a horses legs?  No way!  Those horses would have been downed in seconds.  Again when the horses charged down the mountainside to save the day.  They would have been murdered by all those spears no questions asked.  (And don't tell me the light did them in remember in Fellowship of the Ring it was said that the orkii traveled by day.  Sun was maybe not their favorite thing, but they could deal with it.)  Next magic: what in the world was the director thinking?  I think Gandalf has used magical abilities a total of ONE time this film.  He's a wizard; he just doesn't do magic.  ...  When Gandalf charged over that hill he should have thrown out his staff and knocked back a hole for the horses to charge through.  Now that combined with the sun and the surprise attack would have been a believable victory. ...",1048032000,3,3018,4.290035587188612
1468092,5,B00005JKZU,"Okay, the storyline is somewhat different than the trilogy written by J.R.R. Tolkien in the 1930's, it is still without a doubt the best serial movie since the first Star Wars series, if not better.  I discovered Tolkien almost 30 years ago at a garage sale in Texas, and it not only had the trilogy, but his complete writings, including his Son's book The Simirillian.  I was pleased at reading The Hobbit, and that he carried some of the charaters into the trilogy, and was so far ahead of his time, it is unbelievable.
In many ways, it is like Steven King's The Gunslinger series (although he has yet to release the final chapter), you will not forget anything you read the year before.  Tolkein has done the same with this series.  And also true to Steven King's novels made into movies, there are few that match up to the book itself, due to the difficulty to portray what each character is actually thinking.  I have read some here who say it is boring, or that it is boring compared to the first movie, if so, then obviously you haven't read the book.  I am certian that the last in the series, it will keep you in suspence and promises to be spellbounding.  If you miss this movie, don't bother to see the last until it is released in DVD or Video, or you will be lost, you must see the whole thing to have the desired effect, it is worth the $8.50 per person to plop down.

1468274,2,B00005JKZU,"Absurd changes to Theoden, Grima, Gimli, Saruman, Aragorn, the Battle of Helms Deep, Treebeard, Gollum and the dynamic between Frodo and Sam, as well as some gratuitous special effects (why have the Nazgul flying scenes?  How do they further the story?), make this, as a faithful version of the book of the same name, only a one-star film.
What gives it two stars are the special effects generally, and the event-like nature of experiencing the film.  Once those effects are no longer the ""newest-latest"" and once watching the film is no longer an event, I'll probably agree with every single awards list on Earth and patently ignore the rather horrid acting (except for Miranda Otto, who is perfect as Eowyn, even if she's been driven to a silly ""love triangle"" role in the script), and be forced to lower the rating even further.
Dwarf comedy indeed...
If Peter Jackson wanted to make his own fantasy film, why call it The Two Towers and use characters from someone else's work?
It's not like Tolkien needed exposuure or anything; the literary work was valued so much that Lord of the Rings is the second-most popular book ever...behind only the Bible.
Second most popular EVER.
But instead of a faithful rendition, we get Aragorn over a cliff in a made-up Warg battle, and Faramir taking the ring to Osgiliath, in clear ""violation"" of who Faramir was?
Again, PJ should have had the courage to make his own film, and conceive his own characters.  To do much of that under the cowardice of making money off of someone else's characters and basic storyline, is rather sad.",1047945600,6,1572,4.772058823529412

Readers of a dearly loved book will forgive omissions if there is an obvious reason for them; but very properly, they will not forgive substitutions.""
Thus wrote David O. Selznick to Alfred Hitchcock concerning ""Rebecca"", a film based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier.  Selznick's advice was not heeded by the writers of ""The Two Towers"", a film which provides an exciting and memorable three hours at the movies but is a disappointment as an adaptation of the middle volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"".
The many critics and moviegoers who seem to prefer ""Two Towers"" to ""Fellowship"" as a movie, considered apart from its source material, are arguably correct.  ""Two Towers"" provides a more intense rollercoaster ride than ""Fellowship"".  It has more of everything:  more characters, more storylines, more special effects, more battle scenes, even more themes in Howard Shore's superb score.
""Two Towers"" also has more scenes than ""Fellowship"" in which Tolkien's story has been altered for dubious reasons.  Why should Theoden be possessed by Saruman when he is merely debilitated by Wormtongue's whisperings in the book?  Why do Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have to fight off the men in Theoden's hall to allow Gandalf to walk up to the King if no such thing occurs in the book?  Did Peter Jackson and company think the scene couldn't be exciting without a little fighting?  Why are the refugees of Rohan attacked by Warg-riders when the only remotely comparable sequence in Tolkien's ""LOTR"" occurs in ""Fellowship"" and was rightly omitted from last year's film as unnecessary to the story?
Meanwhile, east of the Anduin, Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum is garnering well-deserved praise.  But Gollum's character arc is radically distorted by having the sympathetic Smeagol think he has banished the evil Gollum personality from his mind for part of the movie.  No such development occurs in the book.
The presence of Elves at Helm's Deep bothers me somewhat less than the other changes; the controversial depiction of Faramir bothers me almost not at all due to the nobility with which David Wenham invests the character.  I must comment, however, on the Ents.  As visual creations they are beautiful and convincing.  Their presentation in the script, however, is not fully effective.  Treebeard makes his first entrance killing an Orc; although the Ents' dangerousness is certainly emphasized in the book, the overall impression Tolkien gives of them is of peaceful, gentle guardians of nature who must be roused to their awesome and deadly wrath.  The atmosphere Tolkien carefully builds up in the chapter ""Treebeard"" is largely absent from the film's Ent scenes.  As Treebeard carries Merry and Pippin hither and thither through the forest, the scenes fail to pull their weight with respect to the film as a whole.
In Brian Sibley's ""Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide"", Jackson is quoted as saying, ""...almost without exception, all those things that are memorable and vivid from reading the books are there in the movies.""  Apparently Jackson considers none of the following things ""memorable"" or ""vivid"":  the fact that Theoden is debilitated simply by being convinced he is too old to fight; Sam seeing one and only one Oliphaunt in his life, not two; Faramir learning Frodo has the Ring because Sam blurts the fact out; and the arrival of the Ents and Huorns at Helm's Deep at dawn.
I disagree.
I have great respect and admiration for Peter Jackson.  As a Tolkien fan, I am deeply appreciative of the effort he has put into his ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  I did find ""The Two Towers"" an enjoyable experience, and I remain hopeful that ""The Return of the King"" will be of such excellence that the complete Trilogy will be a cinematic masterpiece and a superb adaptation of Tolkien.  The fact remains, however, that in my opinion Tolkien's ""Two Towers"" would be one of the world's great fantasies even if the rest of the trilogy did not exist.  This is not true of Jackson's ""Two Towers"".",1047427200,5,4183,4.978448275862069
1468277,5,B00005JKZU,"The second part to Peter Jackson's collosal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is even more visually impressive than FELLOWSHIP, with new characters including King Theoden, Eomer, Grima Wormtounge and the ancient Treebeard. This time around, the fellowship has parted into three groups; Frodo and Sam force Gollum to take them to the black gate at Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin. And the Istari Gandalf returns as the more powerful Gandalf the White after defeating the Balrog. The story is more emotional than Fellowship, and the central characters are stronger presences than before. Jackson's excellent direction makes this one of the most amazing films ever made. From the march of the ents toward Isengard, Saruman unleashing his army to ""Destroy the world of men"", it all culminates in the incredible battle of Helm's Deep, an amazing action sequence where the seamless blend of CG and live-action builds up to a fantastic climax. Howard Shore's strident score encapsulates the very essence of Tolkein's thoughts and emotions. Ian McKellen turns in another great performance as Gandalf, but it is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn who does most of the action here, and he's great. John Rhys- Davies and Orlando Bloom provide strong gravitas, plus with such a vast array of strong supporting actors, the combined strength of veterans like Benard Hill as Theoden and Christopher Lee as Saruman makes the story come alive. As strong as the characters are in TOWERS however, it's the CG-created Gollum that is the most amazing. Putting lame Jar-Jar and Harry Potter creatures to shame, Andy Serkis' performance helps the emotional presence of an essentially computer-generated character come to life. Treebeard and the Ents are fantastic examples of top-notch CG, but they say that the best effects are the ones you don't notice, which is true in this film. You are so focused on the story, the fleshed-out characters and the spirit of Tolkein's tome coming to life that the CG is simply assisting the tale. This is a film which you have to watch at least three times to fully appreciate all the effort that went into making a true masterpiece.

1468278,5,B00005JKZU,"I was spellbound by the previous Lord Of The Rings film, ""Fellowship Of The Ring"". The previous is more like an introduction to the characters of the trilogy. However, that one, as powerful, riveting, and astounding as Fellowship is, it is eclipsed by this second installment film in the three part trilogy The Two Towers. The cast of this movie is perfect. The same held true with the previous as well. The thing that I found vastly improved was the grouchy dwarf Gimli. I wasn't fond of him as he seemed selfish, pompous and having a too big of an ego in the first LOTR movie but in the second LOTR movie, he was vastly improved in this movie. Gimli was much funnier expressed much more humor, and showed a much more heroic attitude to become one of the highlight characters in my opinion.
The whole imaginative world that J. R. Tolkien built in his mind wouldve put anything that George Lucas or Steven Spielberg wouldve imagined to shame. No pun intended. He made up entire languages, entire language accents, entire worlds, it goes on. He wouldve been impressed by the movie screen adaptations. No other novel that Ive read has been so well adapted to the big screen like Lord Of The Rings has and I doubt itll be surpassed for a long time if ever. What I find amazing about the LOTR movies so far is that things that make most other fantasy movies rather cheesy sometimes, they add so much to this movies power and emotion especially the talk treelike people, the Ents.
Just trying to be able to put even a drop of the creativity that Tolkien had, onto the big screen seemed impossible but with the help of Peter Jackson, doing so succeeded in every way. Ian McKellen was perfect to play Gandalf. I especially find it wonderful to see the husky voiced Christopher Lee play the renegade wizard Saruman. Even the Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger team doesnt stand a chance against the menacing Saruman, Gandalf, Frodo, or Aragorn. Those movies are all classics but The Two Towers alone in more powerful than Star Wars, & Harry Potter combined! Jacksons directing is stunning & mind boggling. In fact, from my perspective, this movie is on the border of being perfect! The visuals are amazing especially with the Saurons Eye, and the lightning above Mt. Doom, as well as the birds eye view of Sarumans Tower Palace and the Gates to it and not to mention the green creature Gollum. The way they made the computer generated creature look almost like real life footage is unbelievable and the pain, madness, and sadness is expressed in his eyes are crystal clear. The storylines are incredible emotionally deep and moving. There isn't one drop of talent that is wasted in the movie.
Picking up where ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" left off where Frodo and Samwise were when they saw the fiery Mount Doom, the two run into the alienish looking creature Gollum, a former Hobbit named Smagol, who found the Ring after it being lost and forgotten for thousands of years and being tormented by it's power for hundreds of years before Bilbo Baggins found it after Gollum lost it and Frodo now had the ring and is on his bid to destroy it in the fires of Mt. Doom but encounters Gollum, the one who found it after it was lost for thousands of years. Due to the permanent mental poisoning caused by the ring and his experience of the rings power, not to mention that he seems to suffer from schizophrenia, he guides Frodo & Samwise (who does not trust Gollum) towards the fiery Mt. Doom. At the same time, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli hunt down orcs that captured Pippin & Merry during the battle that claimed the life of Borimir in the last movie and involved the Fellowship being dispersed with Frodo going on his own. The two hobbits escape the orcs though and what lies ahead for them is well, lets just say, out of this world.
However, that is not the main thing that makes this one rank above Fellowship What makes this one even more powerful is that towards the ending, theres a powerful message at the ending that is oh so true but Im not going to give it out on this review as I feel that doing so would spoil the thrills. I had sky high hopes for The Two Towers but to my surprise, this movie not only met them, it surpassed them by a thousand miles to become my favorite movie of all time. Ill admit that yes, there are more characters, events and others things in the books than there are in the movies but the movies themselves are so mind-boggling and stunning that its totally forgivable as it would be impossible to yank everything out of the books without making the individual movies at the very least 5 hours long!
I think overall, I think this one may as well turn out to be the best of the three, as well as the one with the most substance. All I can do now is try to keep myself entertained as I now begin the excruciating one year wait for the cataclysmic finale Return of the King and witness the final battle to save Middle Earth from the evil clutches of Sauron. Ultimately, these three movies will become legendary classics as the years progress and become favorites for generations to come. I look forward spending 9 to 10 hours watching all three LOTR movies the whole way through when all three of them are out on video. Go see this movie pronto! Okay, maybe I might be exaggerating myself but believe me, there isn't enough I can to to express how much I love this incredible movie.  Well, Im now pretty much exhausted of words. Bye!

The Two Towers picks up mid stride and follows as each group moves inexorably toward their destinies in this classic struggle of good and evil. Tolkien gave us the war we wish we were fighting and Peter Jackson lets us struggle with a foe whose face we can see, an enemy we can recognize on sight. The battles of the Two Towers are fought, for the most part, on open battlefields; far removed from innocent civilians. The Two Towers also echoes America's view of itself as a reluctant warrior. None of these characters wants be be involved in the battle to free the world from the clutches of evil by destroying the One Ring. But, as Sam says, some things are just worth fighting for. Be sure to have seen the first movie to fully understand the second; for the only recap is that of Gandalf the Gray falling to flame and shadow in a dream that Frodo has in the opening minutes.
Once again the grandeur of the New Zealand countryside provides a breath taking setting and the genius of the computer generated portions of the action blend seamlessly with the stuff of real life. Readers of the Trilogy will recall that The Two Towers was the most action filled of the three books when they sit thru this 3 hour movie in what seems like an hour and a half. If there was any portion of the movie that didn't exceed my expectations, it would be the sound track. Although Howard Shore did a wonderful job once again; there were times I wanted more from the music. I wanted strings or ethereal choral voices to sanction the tears that were welling in my eyes when Gimli and Legolas learn that Aragorn had fallen. In the midnight showing, an actual CHEER went up from the crowd when Gandalf the White returned to give hope once more to the trio seeking Merry and Pipin. Smeagol aka Gollum, added a dimension to the movie that was greater than his role in the book; it was brilliant acting by Andy Serkis in a mode that at times seemed impossible, that made it all so real.
In post 9/11 America, this movie affirms that there are absolutes in both worlds and that the forces of good, although tempted to use the tools of evil, must 'stay true'(as Aragorn puts it) to themselves and to their knowledge of good, in order to prevail. What is more, movies like The Two Towers help to show us who we want to be rather than who we are. And as Sam says, this movie reminds us that there are still things worth fighting for.

1468282,5,B00005JKZU,"For me, without a doubt, The Two Towers has been one of the finest movies ever crafted.  From the acting, to the peril, to the excellent battle scenes, this movie is almost perfect, offering an excellent bridge one of the greatest trilogies ever.  Being the middle movie in a trilogy is tough, since there is no real beginning and end for the movie.  Still, the Two Towers truly adds a level of emotion and energy that really makes a great feeling coming out of the movie; the feeling where you can't wait to go back in.
It's pretty understandable that die-hard fans of the books will not like this movie as much as casual moviegoers will.  There are many changes to the storyline within the Two Towers from book to screen. But carrying a bias against a movie because it's based on a book is probably one of the worst things you can do.  Most of the complaints over this movie isn't it's enjoyability or it's themes; it's because Aragorn didn't do this or Gandalf didn't do that.  To totally transfer The Lord of the Rings 100% loyally to a movie would be pretty risky, if not stupid.  Just look at the 1978 animated version.  But, anyway, some story needs to be sacrificed for emotional purposes.  While some decisions can be questioned (such as why Faramir wasn't used as a contrast to Boromir), others have certain belief to them.  Okay, so in this version elves help out humans at Helm's Deep.  Just because the book never said it doesn't mean the battle sucks or it's boring.  Did you really come here to see a movie, or just read the book all over again?  I felt the changes for the most part were nice, keeping the movie fresh.  If you think about it, while certain events have been modified and changed, the core of the story is still fully intact.  The Two Towers doesn't stray as far off the path as some seem to think.  As for the missing battles (Gandalf and Saruman, etc.), they're already hinting that these will be in Return of the King.  Boromir's death was moved to Fellowship, so it's not unheard of to shift these battles to Return of the King either.  If these are important to the story, they will be there.
Back to the movie, it's truly awesome for those who don't mind the event changes.  The Two Towers truly creates a growing sense of peril, and hits some very tense moments, truly showing viewers the danger that Middle Earth and others are in.  The battle scenes are massive and beautiful, and thank god that Peter Jackson doesn't cut away from the action every half second like some directors do.  These fight scenes never get repetitive or boring, and truly a sight to see.  The acting is also top notch, as well as just about everything else.  The Two Towers is also much faster than Fellowship, allowing for more action and movement.
If you're looking for a great movie, than The Two Towers is it.  One of the finest adventure movies ever created if I may say so, it really has some cinematic power to it.  But if you're looking for The Two Towers 100% true to the story; you're better off just reading the books.",1047081600,5,3044,4.471014492753623
1468451,4,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson's epic film version of JRR Tolkien's classic fantasy trilogy continues.  The fellowship has split into three parts and we follow each as it makes its way toward the events of ""The Return of the King.""  Frodo and Sam make their way toward Mordor in the company of Gollum, an incredible CGI creation.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stand with the men of Rohan against the onslaught of Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, culminating in the most spectacular battle in film history.  Merry and Pippin find themselves in the company of the tree-like ents and are present at the defeat of Saruman.
There is much to admire here.  The special effects are magnificent and the talented cast continues to deliver fine performances.  The storyline, however, is not nearly as coherent or unified as ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""  The political situation and relations among the royal family of Rohan were rushed and confusing, Gandalf's return from apparent death was not satisfactorily explained, and the battle of Gondor was overwhelmed by the spectacle of Helm's Deep, making it seem incomplete and inconclusive.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film quite a bit and count myself very pleasantly surprised at the fine job that Jackson and company are doing bringing this classic story to the screen.  No doubt an extended DVD of Towers is on its way.  I expect it to eliminate my complaints about the theatrical version, just as the ""Fellowship"" DVD did so much to deepen the characters and story of that film.",1046908800,2,1500,4.968

I also have enjoyed the movie version of LOTR as another story, not totally true to the original story, just another story loosely based on the original.  In an of itself, it is enjoyable, but it has certainly driven me back to enjoy the ""truth"" of the story, back to the books themselves.
By themselves, the movies are great.  Some of the best fantasy story telling ever.  The locales, and the blend of computer generated and real characters are almost seamless.  The story can be enjoyed without noticing changes from ""real"" to computer generation.  The movies can stand alone (well, actually as three parts of a whole) for enjoyment, quality and excitement.  But, as has been mentioned before, are not totally true to the books.  For that, you must pick them up and enjoy the life's work of a word master.",1046822400,,952,4.526315789473684
1468453,2,B00005JKZU,"I love Tolkien. And I love 'The Lord Of The Rings', which is exactly why ridiculing the book pisses me off. 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' was a thoroughly great movie, but the same cannot be said about 'The Two Towers'.
'The Two Towers', apart from being pretty boring (unlike the book), also manages to leave to boundaries of good taste, as can be seen most vividly in the scenes with ents and Gimli. The ents (who are, by the way, almost sacred creatures for every Tolkienist), instead of being portrayed as wise, are depicted as overwhelmingly stupid. Gimli is depicted as a clown, which is also absolutely unacceptable, considering he is a part of the fellowship. I definitely didn't expect seeing things like this after seeing the first movie.
I also don't see what's the point in showing Aragorn's dreams (???) or concentrating on Liv Tyler's bosom for several seconds (not to say it's not interesting, but what does it have to do with anything?). Still, what I missed the most in the movie was the spirit of Tolkien, which WAS present in 'The Fellowship'. There is none of it here.
I suppose I will go see the third movie, but only in hopes the producers will have learned from their mistakes...",1046822400,14,1201,4.643192488262911

1468455,4,B00005JKZU,"For J.R.R. Tolkien fans (of whom I am one): I found that I enjoyed Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation much more after I came to peace with the notion that it is not the book on a movie screen, but rather a story in its own right that captures the major themes of Tolkien's story. This helps one overcome the sense of betrayal at the plot and character changes and to savor the artistic merit of the films as a fabulous depiction of an imagined medieval world. This kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew the general storyline. Peter Jackson says in one of his commentaries that he wanted to visually re-create the beauty of Middle Earth as a compensation for any disappointment that Tolkien fans might feel with the plot changes, and in that sense I believe he has succeeded: we do feel we have visited Middle Earth (helped in no small part to the wild beauty of New Zealand). This rich depiction of the landscape of Middle Earth is what I enjoy most about the movies. Now when I go back to read the books, I have much more to feed my imagination, even when I imagine the scene differently.",1046649600,5,1114,4.3349282296650715

I praise the people who were brave enough to make this into a movie and make it work so well. You can see the bonds between the actors and it ( in the movie) even cracks a few jokes. If your worried about the time, its almost 3 1/2 hours long, dont, it goes by fast. They picked excellent and admorable people to do this movie and all of the time and the effort that went into these movies really shows.

1468457,4,B00005JKZU,"I really enjoyed The Two Towers.  Not because it was a faithful movie adaptation of the book, but because I enjoyed it for what it was.  My expectations were not that I was going to view a movie version of the book.  I was going to see a movie that I hoped would be entertaining in its own right.  This movie did that for me.
  I can understand the disappointment of those who desire to see a movie about a book that they love.  I enjoy getting caught up in a book and letting my imagination take over.  However, I don't expect everyone to envision the story in their mind the same way that I do.  That is why I have tried to watch the first and second installments of this trilogy without preconceived ideas of how the story should be handled.
  I found this movie very entertaining.  I enjoy being able to go to a movie without being bombarded with a lot swearing and sexual situations.  For that I am thankful.  There was a fair amount of violence in this movie, but it would be hard to tell a story like this without the action.
  A lot of the tension in those scenes has been relieved by making Gimli into sort of a comic character.  This is one of the changes from the book that I enjoyed.  I think it would have been too dark and intense without it.  I was a little disappointed that the movie changed character traits of some of the more noble characters of the book.  There are also some of other deviations from the book that I wish they would have handled differently.
  I do not think that this movie was as good as the first one.  I thought the action scenes were more powerful in the first movie, and I also thought that the action scenes in the first movie touched me in a more deeper way.  However, I still enjoyed this movie very much.  It was very well done.",1046563200,5,1776,4.198813056379822
1468458,5,B00005JKZU,"Having read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings more than 30 times (and dozens of times his other works), I note that Peter Jackson joins nearly every ""Two Towers"" reader in the same mistake:  one tower is indeed Saruman's Orthanc, however the other is NOT Sauron's Barad-dur, but is rather the guard tower (containing Shelob's lair) above the Morgul pass, which is not even addressed in the second installment of Jackson's epic movie endeavor.  That said, the ""LOTR: The Two Towers"" movie is still a mighty and overwhelming experience--leaving the theater I could scarcely catch my breath.
At the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" two groups of characters were separated by the great River Anduin.  Tolkien's second volume dealt with the conquests of the two Towers as separate books, only fleetingly referring to simultaneous events.  Peter Jackson utilizes film's ability to intertwine events, yet his differing treatment on each side of the Anduin gives us a greater appreciation of the two separate quests and the importance of each.
Though not following the book as carefully as some would hope, the movie builds anticipation for the showdown with the first Tower, Orthanc, and at Helm's Deep, Jackson truly captures the horror Tolkien felt about war, then takes it to a higher level by brilliantly insinuating the Elves of Lorien (not remotely connected to that battle in Tolkien's book).  Especially keep an eye on the Elf Haldir for an extraordinary acting moment, where, more fully than Jackson or Tolkien do through Arwen, the essential difference between Elves and mortal Men is hauntingly illuminated.
On the Mordor side of the river, Frodo and Sam meet and subdue Gollum who agrees to lead them into Mordor.  Peter Jackson and the Andy Serkis characterization of Gollum shows us, more convincingly than through Frodo and the Eye, the evil and anguish of the One Ring--even the ending song breaks your heart while making your skin crawl.  In another glaring divergence from Tolkien's book, the character Faramir forces Frodo, Sam and Gollum to accompany he and his men into battle, but then Peter Jackson uses this scenario to remind us that courage is more than strength in arms and determination more than brute force.  Though the movie ends with them not yet having conquered the second Tower, Frodo and Sam emerge as victorious as those on the other side of Anduin.
Peter Jackson uses the basic storyline of the second volume of Tolkien's trilogy and creates a marvelous visual interpretation of the grandiose adventure begun in ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  More importantly, Jackson's ""LOTR: The Two Towers"" takes us to new heights of terror, new depths of despair, and new breadths of understanding.  It is not to be missed.",1046476800,12,2732,5.024336283185841
1468629,5,B00005JKZU,"I loved every minute of this awesome masterpiece of cinematography.  There, I've said it all up front and I make no apologies.  Let's be honest, Jackson had the best of all stories to work with.  The movie was never going to fail on story line, it was only doomed if Jackson couldn't pull off the monumental task of transposing the epic trilogy to the big screen while doing justice to the sumptuous splendour of Tolkein's book.  The Two Towers revolves around the Battle of Helms Deep.  A battle that ranks in my humble opinion as one of the most inspiring in cinematic history.  Certainly it is 90% CGI, but that is mainstream cinema these days and it is accepted by this reviewer, who still appreciates old-fashioned moviemaking. The Battle of Helms Deep ranks with me as my all-time favourite movie battle, co-equal with the battle-scenes in the epic movie `The Battle of Waterloo' (...) and `Saving Private Ryan'.  If the `Battle of Helms Deep' was spectacular then the creature Gollum was nothing short of brilliant.  This is CGI gone mega-marvellous. Gollum left me gob-smacked. The creators at Weta Productions have set a benchmark here that leaves other notables fumbling for their keyboards and mice.  Nothing George Lucas has ever done (and I am a great Star Wars fan) comes close to this wizardry.  It's worth the price of admission just to see Gollum.  Dare I repeat myself but I admire everything about the Two Towers.  The great scenery, the story, the costumes, the creatures, the action.  They form the ingredients for a feast that we savour for three swashbuckling hours.  Let's dispense with the negatives.  Sure the move is not absolutely true to the book.  But there isn't a director on the planet that could have captured the whole story in just over three hours. Some things had to miss out, and I'm sure that was one of the tougher parts of the production, deciding what doesn't make the final cut.  The ending was a big call, and readers of the book will know what I am talking about.  I've no complaints, only elated anticipation for the third in the trilogy.  And that's where I will end.  Not only have we been given something truly special again.  It's only the second instalment.  I've got another eleven months to savour The Two Towers and my mouth is already watering for the third and final feature.  Glorious, just glorious.  Five stars just isn't good enough, take five galaxies Peter Jackson.",1046304000,34,2428,4.753588516746412
1468630,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is BETTER (yes, better) than its prequel, The Fellowship of the Ring!  There is colossal computer effects, a total change in the musical score, and, of course, great adventure and action.
 Frodo and Sam are on the way to Mordor alone.  But ""alone"" is not really what they are.  Gollum, or Smagol, is on their trail.  Frodo manages to get through to Gollum so that he now sees Frodo as his master, and leads them into Mordor.
 Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hot on the trail of the Uruk-hai that took Merry and Pippin.  And while they are unable to retrieve the hobbits themselves (who find their own way out), they are intercepted by an old, unexpected friend...Gandalf!  But returned as Gandalf 'the White'.
 The Two Towers introduces us to more characters such as Thoden, the king of Rohan who has been overpowered by Saruman through Grma Wormtongue.  There is also owyn, and her brother, omer.  owyn is presented as a young woman who is dying to prove herself and also adds to the romantical conflict of Aragorn and Arwen.  Faramir, also, is introduced.  He's the brother of Boromir who died in the last movie.  There are new places:  Fangorn Forest, Rohan, Helm's Deep, the Dead Marshes.
 The anticipated battle of Helm's Deep by readers won't disappoint anyone; it's EXCELLENT!  However, I personally felt slightly undaunted, having known the battle's outcome.  But you do get a certain adrenaline rush each time you see it.
 The one difference between 'Fellowship' and 'Towers' is that in the first there was always things happening that seemed to jump-start you so much that you found yourself gripping the edge of your seat out of anticipation; as if even the movie's atmosphere wasn't to be trusted.  But in 'Towers', it has calmed down some.  You still feel a certain untrustworthiness, especially in Gollum, and you definitely feel hopeless at times.  How are they ever going to survive against ten thousand Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep?  How is Frodo ever going to hold out, as he slowly begins to break?  Those are just a couple of questions that go through your mind.
 I always have to comment on a film's music.  The score was totally different in that there was a Rohan theme on a Norwegian violin, as well as new vocals (Isabel Bayrakdarian, Ben del Maestro, Emiliana Torrini) and the most glorious, victory-ridden sequence I have ever heard in my life which adds up all the film's physical and mental strifes.  There are also small snippet reprises from the 'Fellowship' score.  Howard Shore did very, very well.
 Peter Jackson and his team of filmmakers are some pretty serious filmmakers.  Their fantastic teamwork really shines in this film's final cut, and that, I'm sure, goes for 'Fellowship' and 'Return of the King'.",1046304000,7,2760,4.835470085470085
1468631,5,B00005JKZU,"Well, if you thought Fellowship of the Ring was good, The Two Towers steps up to the plate and works just beautifully as the sequel.
Of course, the main elements are the battle at Helm's Deep, the return of Gandalf (now the White), entirely CGI Gollum, and ditto CGI with Treebeard.
It's just an absolutely cool movie! It doesn't need a bunch of sex and bad words to make it worth going to either. The only problem people might have with it is violence, which can be intense for youngsters, and even adults.
Still, I loved the movie. It works excellently with Tolkien's second book in the trilogy, though there ARE some bones to pick with it: some things are definitely changed, the biggest one taking place in Faramir, who in the books is a stout, brave-hearted nobleman who refuses to give in to the temptation of the Ring. In the movie, it's quite different.

1468634,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: Two Towers is certainly much better than 2002's other sequels.  Attack of the Clones had some good character development, but lack of good screenplay and overabundance of special effects.  Chamber of Secrets had just enough special effects and a not so bad screenplay, but lack of character development.  Two Towers has just enough of everything and a good screenplay.
 There were several things I liked in particular about TT.  I really liked Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, they put such emotion and presence into their roles as possible and greatly improved my opinion of them.  All the other actors did a good job too, especially John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, and Brad Dourif as Wormtongue.
 Secondly, the special effects, which perhaps barely outranked those of FOTR.  The beginning fight with the Balrog, the cool Ents (especially at the end, when poor Saruman met his match: kung-fu trees), the Wargs battle (though added scene was well-done) and the Wraiths on Wings were very good.  And of course the brilliant Andy Serkis doing the movements and excellent voice for an equally brilliant CG Gollum.  He was robbed an Oscar nomination.  Helm's Deep was a really cool battle scene too.
 Now for the complaints:  what in the world was up with Faramir?  While I understand the reason for changing his character according to the words of Galadriel, I was still upset with them.  I always admired the nobility in Faramir of the books, but they've gone and ruined that.  The exorcism of Theoden wasn't as bad as I heard, but it was still a little weird.  The scenes of Arwen and Elrond always made be uncomfortable, because Arwen wasn't supposed to be there and Elrond was too un-elven.
 But in general, the movie is really cool and the music is excellent.  Go and see it, but make sure you saw the first movie first.",1046217600,3,1876,4.770186335403727

1468788,5,B00005JKZU,"I had to breathe. The fact that I had just taken my last final, and could have been on my way home for Christmas break meant little to me, because I was standing in line at the Uptown Cinema in Washinton, D.C. waiting to get in to see the movie I had been anticipating for months. I was a little delirious...I had stayed up late studying for my history final, my brother called at 6am eastern time to tell me he had just seen the midnight showing of The Two Towers in California (bloody sneak), I asked what was left of my brain to be of use at 8:30 that morning while I was being tested on ancient Greece, and now I was walking in to a grand film about the second part of a book that had moved me more than any other written work i had ever read. i was a little delerious. I went alone because my friend that was planning to accompany me couldn't wait to get home...obviously she wasn't too excited about the film. I really didn't care, I just wanted to see it. (sigh) I had to breathe. Well I breathed and I saw the film, and this is my reaction:
In terms of the book's content, the film wastes a great deal of screen time concerning itself with the Isengard vs. Rohan Battle (at Helm's Deep). Here, Dir. Peter Jackson found it necessary to include stunts like Legolas' surfing down the steps on a shield while he shoots orcs-move, and the completely invented appearance of the Mirkwood Elves who turn up to help out- a scene that caused one viewer I know to thumbs down the film automatically.
Sam and Frodo's scenes can be criticized even further, as they progress less then Aragorn's scenes in terms of Tolkien's work. Jackson has saved the appearance of Shelob for Part Three, which is evidentally also where the choices of Master Samwise will play out. Both are seen before Return of the King by the reader of Tolkien's chronology. This is not so troubling as the portrayal of Faramir in the film, who resembles more closely his brother, as he is tempted by the ring and forces it to Gondor, where he finally allows Frodo and Sam to escape with it after a change of heart. Tolkien certainly took care to contrast Faramir drastically with Boromir from the beginning in his work. We'll have to wait for Part III before Sam and Frodo even reach Minas Morgul, so the final part of the trilogy will be eventful to say the least.
The character of Gollum turned out interestingly. He was created through methods that have really never been used by Hollywood before. He seems a complete CGI character on the screen, when in fact he is in large part - human actor (played expertly by Andy Serkis). Serkis provided not only all the voiced lines, but also most of the movement and action of the character. Very well done, and thumbs up to Peter Jackson for that, however, in the end i thought Serkis' choice to play Gollum as a sort of sweet schizophrenic with no internal monolgue was a bit off the mark.
So why do I want to cry like a baby every time I see this film? I actually did the first two times I saw it. Jackson's skill with direction may superseed his skill with the pen. The emotion and character relationships in this film are phenominal. The sheer power that the emotion emits somehow captures the way I feel when I'm studying Tolkien's works. God only knows how he did it, but he did. Although the Fellowship ended up as a better film, The Two Towers is truly The Lord of the Rings.",1045699200,,3394,4.371835443037975

have decided that i can live with the ""artistic liberties"" jackson took with this movie. i mean, i guess i can live with the fact that movie-faramir is just totally different from book-faramir... i may not like it, but i can swallow that.
good gawd, i have to say that i <i>absolutely love</i> the fighting scenes in this one. man, it blew my mind away!!! it was just totally crazy and beautiful at the same time... i'm speechless really...
one of the best entrances yet has to be when gandalf and eomer arrived on the eastern side of the mountain on the fifth morning. stunning and breathtaking. gawd i love the scene where the riders descend from that frigging steep mountain side... *looks like stunned fish* just amazing...

1468791,5,B00005JKZU,"Looking back a few years it seems quite extraordinary that any studio would have even thought twice about plowing a multi-million dollar figure into making the rings trilogy. Even if the films were average they by law of averages would still have made a decent profit. When the first installment in the trilogy hit the screens last year it was an awesome sight, this was a film that blended todays modern effects with the traditional scenery that New Zealand had to offer to give a film that not mnay studios make anymore. It's sucess was deserved and it's snub by the major awards for best picture was a joke.
Now we have the middle part known as The Two Towers. To see this movie you really have to have seen the first one and I'd imagine quite a few of us have. At the end of the last movie we saw the fellowship split. Frodo and Sam left to continue their journey towards Mordor. Gandalf was seemingly gone while Merry and Pippin were captured leaving Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in the quest to find them.
This movie picks up where we left off and follows each of the stories. Each one of them interwoven into the big picture as the ring controls the destiny. By far the most interesting part of the movie is Frodo and Sam's journey, this is because they are joined by Gollum, one of the rings previous holders. Gollum is a split personality, his former self Smeagol destroyed by the rings power. Gollum is a CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis and is by far the best thing in the movie. The effects work is outstanding and the majority of the time Gollum is incredibly photo realisitic, there has been talk of an Oscar nomination and yes the work by Serkis by doing the voice and performance is that good.
Elsewhere the big attraction is battle at helms deep, this is the big set piece that has been talked about for months and it doesn't disappoint. CGI and live action melt together to give the effect of over 10,000 orcs marching towards the walls of Helms Deep. This is sheer blood and guts action as swords cross with flaming torches while explosions reign seige and the rain hammers down. It's a stunning spectacle that has to be seen on the big screen. Because of these two plotlines there has to be somthing that is relegated to the background and that's Merry and Pippin's story, their altercation with Treebeard is great but it's pretty slight in the grand scheme of things and it just feels like we're cutting ack to them to keep them in the whole of the story. However at the end there is a big payoff and once again it's an outstanding work of special effects.
I suppose the big question to be asked is ""Is this as good as the last film?"". I would say that it isn't purely because there is more than one story to concentrate on and at times you may loose track of what is happening. But compared to everything else this is still an amazing achievement in film-making and one that demands to be seen.",1045094400,2,2916,4.432029795158287
1468792,2,B00005JKZU,"I had already read the book by the time I watched Two Towers, unlike with FOTR. I liked FOTR, saw it twice in theaters and twice in DVD (original and expanded versions). And you know what? I never tired of it. Of course, I did have to stifle a yawn, but nothing that can't be cured by hitting the pause button, gulping a cup of coffee and resuming.
So I had great expectations for Two Towers. I mean, I liked the book. The movie has to be very good.
Somewhere before the end of the movie, when Treebeard - going back to his home after the entmoot concluded with the ents saying ""this is not our war"" - had got his first eyeful of the desolation around Isengard, the old ent was suddenly at a loss for words. Somewhere in the old Entish, he said, there must be a word to describe what he just saw, but couldn't figure out what it was. I almost wanted to scream: BETRAYAL! It would have been a perfect fit, both for what Saruman did, and for what the filmmakers did.
I am not by any means a book fanatic. I've read a few, but the titles alone of the books I've NOT read will fill an entire book. But I've read the Lord of the Rings, and I know I don't like what I saw in the movie. My seat-of-the-pants meter does not lie, Two Towers left me cramped, tired and bored. I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again, or even buy it in video form.
Yes, there are the character changes, not only to Faramir and the ents, but also to Gandalf, Legolas and Theoden. Those who justify those changes as necessary because time is too short to flesh out the narrative apparently ignore that the filmmakers actually spent considerable time too in showing the alterations. Those precious minutes could have been spent staying faithful to the story, or to its spirit.
Faramir- IMO, the whole trouble of getting to Osgiliath and showing that Faramir was no more than a poor copy of his brother was a waste of screen time. Those who say the changes in Faramir's character were OK and consistent with the idea that the Ring is irresistible to men have not been watching/reading the story. The Ring is not irresistible, otherwise there would have been no hope. Tom Bombadil is not affected by it. Galadriel, a ""senior"" and wise elf, desires it (although she resisted), yet the Ring had no effect on young Legolas whatsoever. Gimli could have withstood it, after all, dwarves have always been difficult subjects for Sauron, and somehow, the Ring has no effect on Gimli either! Boromir fell to it, but Aragorn, as was plain to see, did not. The hobbits Gollum, Bilbo and Frodo found it hard to give the Ring up, yet Sam gives it away without much thought. Obviously the Ring's effect on people is not uniform.
Now, suppose we stay faithful to the book and Faramir ignores the Ring and sends Frodo on his way. Is that too much to ask?
Ents - in the novel, the Ents not only destroy Isengard, they also help save the day at the Hornburg. In the third part, in the Appendix, we see that the Ents also protect Rohan while Theoden marches to Gondor to aid Denethor. Instead in the movie, the Ents, after a long discussion, decide not to interfere (""This is not our war""), only to be roused by one cry from Treebeard. What is this, Pearl Harbor? And the Ents were not terrifying enough, they were too slow. Couldn't Jackson at least watch a marauding bull elephant on National Geographic and take it from there?
Gandalf in the movie also regards Theoden as incapable of making sound decisions, and thinks that the retreat to Helm's Deep was an act of suicide. But in the book, it was Gandalf who tells Theoden to scrap the plan to go to the Fords and proceed directly to Helm's Deep. Above all his tricks (only few of which he displayed), Gandalf's greatest magical act is his capacity to TRUST the free peoples of Middle Earth, to see the good in them.  He alone trusted the hobbits with anything important (Bilbo, Frodo, etc.) and he certainly trusted men.
Also in the movie, Gandalf asks Aragorn to look after Theoden before the old man hurts himself. What was that about? Aragorn was a great hero, but the fact is, at the time in question, he had no army, and only his sword to offer. He's practically a guest, a freelance. He's supposed to look after the Rohirrim who are hopelessly clueless? And why leave them to the care of this weak-kneed movie version of Aragorn? This Aragorn could not have descended from Elendil, Elros, Beren or Barahir.
Legolas actually lost hope in this movie, and it took Aragorn's ""I will die with them"" (a rare display of strength) to convince him the battle is worth fighting. I always thought Legolas had no fear, except when he saw his first Balrog. And he recovered even from that.
Again, there is this tendency to prolong the battle scenes, obviously to sell the movie. The important reunion of the hobbits with their friends and their meeting with Theoden (Merry and Theoden, remember?) was omitted. All for an extended battle that still falls short of exciting. And what were the elves doing in Rohan shooting in unison? The fairest, most creative of the peoples of Middle Earth, reduced to mere automatons? Aragorn directing the archers? Didn't we see enough of that in FOTR's intro?
Do I dislike the movie because of these changes? No, it's because the changes were not even worth the trouble. And oh, did I get tired, and bored and sleepy!",1045008000,43,5348,4.4851282051282055

Treebeard and the other Ents was very funny ,and the return of Gandalf was surprising. Overall, the movie was action-pacted and the music was breath taking. I loved this film and definatly think that it is THE best movie around to this very day. See it, you'll be totally blown away.",1045008000,2,409,4.324675324675325
1468794,5,B00005JKZU,"After 'The Fellowship of the Ring' blazed across cinema screens in all its glory, it was really hard to imagine any film topping it off. Well, those who had read the book knew that what was to come would wipe the first film off the slate. Now, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is here, and it has done the impossible - it IS better!
The film seamlessly runs straight from the first to the second, where we get an even better glimpse at what happened to Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) on the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. The story then continues. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are in pursuit of the hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monohan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been kidnapped by a band of Suruman's (Christopher Lee) orcs. But the hobbits escape, and hide in Fangorn Forest, where they are rescued by a walking, talking tree called Treebeard. The Three Hunters also go into the forest, where they meet someone they don't expect. Soon, these four are off to Edoras, the capital of Rohan, which is under siege from Saruman. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijiah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue towards Mordor. However, they are being followed by Gollum still, and the hobbits capture the snivelling creature and force him to lead them to Mordor.
Once again, Peter Jackson has outdone all expectations. The internal, psychological elements that were so irresistable in the first are back better than ever. Gollum is the most well-portrayed character, giving the creature much more psychological depth than expected. And, as usual, the jaw-dropping special effects continue. The last ten minutes of 'The Two Towers' is the most amazing, breathtaking ten minutes of cinema ever created. It literally leaves you gasping for air.
When it comes to great movies, this film is there. When it comes to brilliant movies, this one is there. Even when it comes to the exclusive catagory of masterpiece, this film, along with its predesessor, is there. There is no doubt that 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the best film of the year. But the best thing is that, watching it, you know that what is coming up in twelve months time, the third and final instalement, 'The Return of the King' will be even better than this. After all, the only thing better than a Lord of the Rings film is another Lord of the Rings film.",1045008000,4,2355,4.76039119804401
1468795,5,B00005JKZU,"When I saw The Fellowship of the Ring, I was stunned. I honestly could not decide if I liked it or not until it sunk in. I thought I would be prepared for The Two Towers: either love it or be slightly dissapointed. Surprisingly, I had the same feeling. I did not know how I felt about Towers. I couldn't dislike it. And yet I found it very hard to like it.
I have finally decided I love it. It is not better than Fellowship. But it just might be as good. The words to describe the first movie would be cathartic, moving, and touching, with an emotional climax. The second movie has a major action climax and is stirring, thrilling, and rousing. While I get choked up and excited by the Fellowship, I feel weary (intentionally) and get chills up my spine in certain scenes. This time around, though, I get a definite feeling of the books. Slightly more how I imagined them, perhaps only because I had seen the first movie.
The songs at the end of each movie beautifully describe the film. Enya's 'May It Be' plays during the final credits of The Fellowship of the Ring. It is beautiful but sad, hopeful but lulling. 'Gollum's Song' is sung by a harsh but emotional female voice. It is pretty but depressing, awesome but foreboding.
As for the story, Frodo and Sam, two hobbits or halflings, are continuing their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the one ring. They meet up with the slinking gollum, a tragic character addicted to the ring. In another story line, Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, an elven archer, and Gimli, a fighsty dwarf, search for Merry and Pippin, two hobbits captured by the Uruk-hai. The third story line is with Merry and Pippin who meet up with a tree-creature in a lively forest. (It's a terrible summary, but you're just going to have to watch the movies to know what I'm talking about.)
Colors are bleak. Music is lovely. By now the characters are so lovable its almost unbearable. I mean, traveling with them through one three hour movie (Fellowship) was tough enough, but now we get to bond with them for three more hours. Elijah Wood is adorable as the burdened ringbearer Frodo gradually slipping into madness and obsession. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic and you realize just how hot he really is as Aragorn. Arwen, Galadriel, and Elrond have cameos and they are all heart wrenching. Sam is lovely, Pippin is cute, Merry is thoughtful, Legolas is whistle-worthy, and Gimli is wonderful.
Newcomers include Miranda Otto as a strong Eowyn, Bernard Hill as an okay Theodon, and Karl Urban as a thoroughly convincing Eomer. Andy Serkis as Gollum was, as far as I could tell, flawless. Wormtongue was suitably creepy. The only character I was not immediately satisfied with was Faramir. The actor was fine, but he seemed more sinister than I pictured Faramir as. I have a feeling though that he will be redeemed in Return of the King, because he had the softspokenness and thoughtfullness to pull it off.
Anyway. You should check this one out. And see it at least twice - it is better the second time. There is too much to assimilate the first time.",1044921600,2,3088,4.596014492753623

By their very nature, every book causes their readers to create an interpretation of the story in their heads, and each reader will have a different interpretation. This movie the version of the book Peter Jackson created in his head.
That being said, please automatically disregard any review that is negative based solely on the fact it doesn't follow the book to the letter.
Is this movie a good movie based soley on it's own merits? Sure it is. The acting is superb, that action sequences and special effects are amazing, and the sets and locations are breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Peter Jackson's INTERPRETATION of Tolkien's masterpiece.
Also, keep in mind that just like the books, these movies are a continuing story. In a traditional trilogy like Star Wars, each movie has a beginning, middle and end and can stand on their own. These movies are a beginning, a middle and an end, and really should be seen in the context of each other, so don't be suprised by the non-ending.",1044489600,4,1139,4.757575757575758

1. Gollum. He was so realistic I sometimes forgot that he was just a CG-rendered image. The audience could both feel for him and take him seriously as an actual character.
2. Treebeard. Another good looking CGI character. Just what I imagined when I was reading the book.
3. The warg attack. Although it wasn't in the book, it provided some nice action when the movie was lagging.
4. The Battle of Helm's Deep. Peter Jackson devoted the last half hour of the movie to the greatest battle sequence ever seen (at least until film #3). Great visual effects used here, as well.
Absolutely astonishing.
So what if there are changes? I thought many were right on. Stop picking the movie apart to find flaws and enjoy it. Book and film are at opposite ends of the media spectrum. In all, this is a must-see.",1044316800,9,899,4.421686746987952
1468916,5,B00005JKZU,"Wow. After all the reviewers who have gone before me and said all the things I wish I could have thought of to say, I guess I'm left with just voicing my opinion.
I'm not a huge Tolkien fan. I don't use the elvin language when instructing telemarketers to go to a dark place. In fact, I have not (gasp!) even read the entire set of books in the Lord of the Rings. So perhaps I can use my voice to speak for the masses of other people like me who aren't obsessed with this great man.
The Two Towers is great! The actors are superb, the setting breath taking, the directing incredible, the computer simulations seamless, the horses unbelieveable ... I could go on and on. This film leaves you drained and stumbling out into the bright world beyond the theater wondering whether you will be able to drive home without encountering any Orks, and (in my case) wishing you had Aragorn by your side to help you make it. Golum was especially well done, fascinating. The interaction between the various groups of wanderers was full of the warmth of friendship. Touching.
However ... having seen both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, I felt the Fellowship was just the least bit better. There was more storyline, I felt, and more suspense.
That said, both of these films were incredible and, having now gone and read the first two books in the series, I felt the movies stayed close enough to the orignal. Movies are different than books. You can't simply take a book and turn it word for word into a movie. I felt the adaptions were well done and did not alter the meaning of the story.
All this from a mere layperson in the Tolkien world! A layperson who recommends you rush out and see this movie, because it will never be the same at home on your small TV screen with your greasy microwave popcorn tucked between your knees and your baby howling....

One thing I didn't like about this movie is that it didn't follow the book The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers very well. In the book, Frodo, Sam and Gollum never go to Osgilath and Faramir never even thinks about taking the Ring. He actually says something like, ""Don't worry Frodo, I'm not going to try to take the Ring from you like my brother."" But for a movie, it was excellent! I can't wait until the Return of the King!

1468918,4,B00005JKZU,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" turns out to be a mighty impressive second installment in the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy - quite an admission from someone who wasn't exactly the greatest fan of the first installment, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.""  That film, for all its visual splendor, narrative ambition and epic scope, ultimately, turned into little more than a conventional monster movie, with the characters battling one strange creature after another to the point where the film finally became a crashing bore long before its three-hour running time was up.  ""The Two Towers,"" though equally long (one minute shy of three hours, to be exact), doesn't fall into this monotonous narrative pattern, thereby allowing for more variety in its story and more depth in its characterizations.
As someone who knows next to nothing about the specifics of the trilogy, I must say that the story can be a bit hard to follow for the non-initiate.  We aren't always sure who is who or just how the battle lines in the various good-vs.-evil conflicts fall out.  This has the unfortunate effect of making the early stretches of the film confusing and, at times, downright incomprehensible.  Luckily, the plot strands begin to straighten themselves out after not too long a time, and one can at least follow the unfolding action well enough to become absorbed in the spectacle on screen.  And impressive that spectacle is, with director Peter Jackson once again creating an entire fantasy world with the help of his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, as well as his various art directors, scenic designers and special effects wizards.
One of the reasons ""The Two Towers"" triumphs over ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is that this newest film provides us with more conflicted, more complex characters.  This is especially true in the case of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who's been entrusted with the powerful ring, but who must now struggle to avoid becoming taken over by its evil power.  Similarly, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process.  These two characters bring some added depth to all the surface magnificence of eye-filling vistas and heart-pounding adventure and battle scenes.
Not being familiar with Tolkien's novels, I cannot say to what extent the film is or is not faithful to the original.  I will, therefore, simply state that ""The Two Towers"" is a powerful and moving saga that can stand on its own as a first-rate movie-going experience.  Having nodded through the first installment of the series, I was not exactly looking forward to Part Two.  Now, having seen Part Two, I can't wait to see Part Three.",1043971200,,2856,5.0021097046413505

But I still think this was a little too gory, but amazing, sort of scary movie. What I liked about it the most is they didn't overdo anything: the scariness, the humor, or the goriness of it all.

The first Lord of the Rings movie was long, but it was propelled by varied events, introductions of new lands and characters, diverse challenges, and so forth.  This movie merely retreads familiar ground, and has very little action.  I was willing to forgive the first movie for its corny dialogue (which I half expect in fantasy movies), but this movie piles on the schlock until I was either laughing or groaning out loud every 5 minutes.

Much of the movie seems to be concerned with keeping everyone on track, so not much happens save for the characters walking around, riding horses, and talking.  Of the few action scenes, the exorcism that Gandalf performs on the king is ridiculous and has been done way too many times.

The closing fight scene went on way too long as well.  I was expecting the fight to last about 10 minutes, but it seemed to go on for about 30, or close to it!

Finally, Gollum was charming (he was by far my favorite character in the books, with Aragorn being second), but his inner-conflict shown in such a blatant external way again made his character laughable.  Another problem was Orlando Bloom, who I felt played one of the strongest and most likeable characters in the first movie:  in this one, though, they didn't seem to know what to do with him.

Visually, this movie was miraculous and breathtaking, but its completely empty story, lack of emotion and depth, and seemingly forced, repetitive, and lengthy fight scenes, made it utterly torturous to watch.  I was literally squirming in my seat for the majority of this film.",1043798400,11,1730,4.617647058823529
1469061,3,B00005JKZU,"Today marks the second time I have seen The Two Towers, and I continue to be amazed by what the special effects team was able to accomplish, especially with Treebeard.  When he first opened his eyes, I thought ""Now that's cool!""  The Dead Marshes (viewed from both above and below the surface of the water) also freaked me out.  The performances were all well done (if I ever have a major undertaking, I hope I have someone like Sam to help me get through it), but I did miss Sean Bean (at least I still had Orlando Bloom -who actually gets a decent amount of lines this time around- and Viggo Mortensen to satisfy my aesthetic needs).
As a movie, I liked it a lot.  As an adaptation of the second installment of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, however, I found it lacking, which is why I only gave it two and a half stars.
I consider myself a pretty strong Tolkien purist, but went into the movie understanding that certain things would be changed/deleted (like Tom Bombadil in Fellowship) to either tighten up the narrative or save time.  But like others have already said in their reviews, I cannot not forgive the way Peter Jackson and his fellow scriptwriters completely destroyed the character of Faramir, especially because there was absolutely no point to it.  Tolkien described him as having the blood of Numenor flowing through his veins, which puts him on pretty much the same level nobility-wise as Aragorn.  He is supposed to be a man of the highest quality and a direct contrast to his brother Boromir, who was unable to withstand the temptation of the Ring.  Faramir's characterization alone made me deduct 1 star from the movie.
I took off another half-star just because of other plot changes that annoyed me, such as the Ents not seeming to know what was going on with the trees they have the ability to communicate with, Eomer being pretty much deleted when in the book he has a significant part (I felt bad for Karl Urban, who could have had a lot more screen time), the Elves showing up at Helm's Deep (and why did they have to bump off Haldir?), Aragorn's trip over the cliff, and having Saruman possessing Theoden.
The scenes with Aragorn, Arwen and Elrond, and the Osgiliath sequence also cost the movie one star in my mind because they took up valuable time that could have been used to actually include some important, vital events in the plot of the second book - the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard with the turnover of the palantir, and the appearance of Shelob causing the capture of Frodo by the orcs.  I felt differently about the inclusion of Boromir's death in Fellowship because it kept the events of that battle together instead of breaking them up into two films.  But I'm just afraid about what this means for the third movie's plot, because Return of the King is a packed enough book already without adding in extra stuff from The Two Towers.  The movie version of Return of the King looks to be either five hours long or suffering from major plot excisions.  Maybe if they put in another teaser trailer at the end of The Two Towers when it's almost done in the theatres (like they did with Fellowship), there will be some clues.",1043712000,10,3186,4.589788732394366
1469062,5,B00005JKZU,"What's with people rating this movie one star? Because it doesn't follow the books perfectly? What a bunch of bologne. J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is one of the most overrated set of books of all time. Certainly the story and world Tolkien created are classic masterpieces, but Tolkien was not an accomplished author, and his writing skills leave a lot to be desired.
Enter the films. Years ago when I heard the trilogy was being made into a live action film I was both excited and worried. Excited that the one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time would be put to the big screen and worried because hollywood almost always takes great ideas and turns them to garbage. My review of Fellowship of the Ring explains how delighted I was not only to see the film done competently but incredibly well. I was now no long worried about any of the following films; I could just be excited.
I must confess that I am a bit confused at why Peter Jackson took even more liberties with this film than even Fellowship of the Ring. Some acts like trying to make the audience believe Aragorn fell off a cliff and died doesn't make sense. I understand that a screenplay and a novel can't be told the same way, but is there anyone who doesn't know that the king in Return of the King is Aragorn? He can't die, so adding a scene like that that wasn't in the book just seemed to be redundant.
The other difference that most people have a problem with (besides the Elves appearing) is that of Faramir's character. Well, despite that one of Tolkien's biggest weaknesses in the writing department is characterization, Faramir was established as a noble soul who did not try to take the ring from Frodo. However, after seeing the film several times I don't think Jackson was wrong to change the events involving Faramir. It's important for one to remember that a filmmaker has only 2-3 hours in which to tell a story. Jackson has already portrayed that the ring is so powerful that no man can turn it away. Too much explaination would have been needed for the non-book reading audience had Faramir acted exactly as he had in the book. In the end, Faramir's actions do not betray his character. He does not take the One Ring and sets Frodo free to continue his journey. Only the way about it is different.
People complain also that the elves do not show up in the book as they do in the film. What poppycock really. It's one of the most powerful scenes in the film and is something that happens in the overall story anyway. Jackson only changes the timeframe in which it happens. The same is true with Eomir showing up at the end with Gandalf. Cinematically it's much better to have Eomir showing up to save the day than some other character you've never heard of. Talk about contrived plot developement.
Finally readers of the book know that the end of the Two Towers deals with the She-spider-creature Shelob. Jackson was as wise to move this to the next film as he was to move Borimir's death to the first.
The fact is, Jackson loves The Lord of the Rings. He's trying to make the best films possible, and I'm glad he's a skillful enough filmmaker to know that Tolkien's books could never be made into a movie as they are written. If it weren't for the fantastic story and world he created, the books would be garbage. Jackson did take some liberties with the story to make these films, and certainly some are questionable. However, it shouldn't be surprising that the only people that bash on the film also happen to be Tolkien bootlickers who think any deviation from the books is blasphemy. I and the millions of others (whether they know it or not) who helped make this movie into one of the biggest boxoffice successes of all time are certainly happy with the exemplary work Jackson and Co. did in carrying Tolkiens masterpiece books into masterpiece films.",1043366400,7,3858,4.544540229885057

As it was, it bordered on being a bit of commercial travel guide for New Zealand, but you had to admit, if you were looking for Middle Earth, they found it and brought it to life, scene after scene.  Could have spent a bit more time with some of the sub rather than Frodo and Sam, who were not prominent in the second book, but the confrontation at Helms Deep and the revenge on Saurman's Tower more than made up for it.

I am one of those people that look forward to not knowing scene by scene what is going to happen, and even though I haven't read the LOTR trilogy, after reading some of the reviews other people have submitted on Amazon.com, am glad that The Two Towers was different than the novel. Now I can look forward to reading it one of these days and feel like I am experiencing it for the first time. Besides--if they made movies long enough to encompass everything included in ANY book, it would either end up being so long and drawn out that they would have to split it up into more than one movie, or the pace would be going so fast that the audience would not be able to absorb every detail and get lost along the way. I for one would feel cheated if I had to wait another year (or more) to see a movie that only covered half a tome. So I encourage anyone who has been considering watching The Two Towers in the theater to do so--you will be greatly missing out if you do not. Even if you have an awesome home theater system of your own, nothing can compare to seeing a movie of this scope on the big screen. The beauty and splendor of this series is just astounding!! Nothing Compares!!!!",1043366400,3,1643,4.219047619047619
1469065,5,B00005JKZU,"To justify my title -- I'm a nerd.  I've always been a nerd.  I'm kind of proud of it.  Solidly in the nerd camp, me. Okay?  Okay. ;-)
Most of the complaints I've heard against this film are from people who are upset because it doesn't follow the plot of the books exactly.  And it doesn't.  It is not a letter-by-letter adaptation of Tolkien.  (When was the last time you saw a film that was?)
A film is not a book.  And I say this as someone who 1) did in fact read the trilogy and 2) Is usually the first to moan and complain when movies are not totally faithful, a habit I needed to be meticulously trained out of over the course of years:
Book to film translation, like translation from language to language, is never merely the extension of the original.  Exact translation (as the teach us in Lit. Crit.) is impossible.  You're working with a new  ""language"" -- signs, signifiers, connotations -- new raw material, which must necessarily give you a new end result.  It's the creation of a work in its own right, and the only fair way to judge it is -- is it successful of a piece, unto itself?  And is it faithful to the spirit?  And this film is.  It SO is.  It is a *good* film, well-plotted, well acted (only the teeniest bit campy :-), and logical, with important, timeless, universal themes, and it gives you the *heart* of the Tolkien text, if not all the details.  (And actually, it gives you a much higher percentage of the details than you'd imagine, if you only judged by the angry people.)
You talk to people who've seen the film but haven't read Tolkien, and get their reactions -- the reactions are very consistently the same ones that I have gotten from reading the books. The noble hero who looks beyond his own ambitions (and well being) to serve the greater need of his people/sovereign/world.  The leader who recovers from manipulation/corruption to do his duty by his people.  The trials of temptation and the slow corruption of power. The leader who recognizes the fallibility in his own first judgment in time to do the right thing.  The neutral party confronted with a time where neutrality must be abandoned.  Loyalty, honor; despair and the overcoming thereof.  And all the naturism vs. technology and so on.  A friend of mine -- who had not even known Tolkien was Catholic --  went on at great length, and with great excitement  (you should have seen the light in his eyes), about ""the Marian imagery and themes"" in the film after having seen it, and how the film ""made him feel like a better person for having seen it"".  AND.... he's gone out to buy the books -- not only the trilogy, but tons of other Tolkien works and apocrypha.  This is a friend who is ""not into fantasy""  (you know those), a friend I had to BEG to see ""Fellowship"" for about a year.  I kid you not.  (And he's proselytizing his little nephews and nieces. It's a little scary, actually.)
Dudes, they *get* it.  The magic is there -- I've seen it in so many of my friends' eyes. The path to it is *slightly* different, but not enough to take anything away from its merit.
Frankly, we purists make up the loudest contingent of LoTR fans -- but not the biggest. Not by a long shot.  If we were the only audience, the film would've flopped.  Instead, it's beating out Harry Potter (who-HOO!!  YES!!!) and bringing a new generation, nerd and non-nerd alike, :-)  to the written works of Tolkien.  Jackson is passing on the essence of Tolkien to a much broader audience, and he's doing a dang good job of it.  And I say hear hear.  Five stars for that alone.",1043366400,6,3556,4.438948995363215

was the sequence of Gollum. His scenes, particularly those were he was arguing with himself, were perfect.

1469068,3,B00005JKZU,"The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Special Expanded Edition has spoiled me. I saw a film turned from a good fantasy film now changed into an epic masterpiece with just 30 minutes of new scenes and re-editing. After enjoying this film many times I went to see the Two Towers knowing that no matter how good (or how bad) it may be, I couldn't help but always wonder what the 'real' version of this film will be like come Nov 2003. Will it become twice as good as Fellowship became?
What we have here is a very good fantasy film, that really throws the book out the window. I feel pretty bad for Jackson who has put himself in quite a pickle. Not only must he worry about fitting ALL the events that occur in the next book but now he has to squeeze in events from the end of the second movie just to have it all make more sense. This is impossible. I had a real problem with the way the film began. We all remember what happened to Gandalf, it seems weird to be re-watching the first film for pretty much no reason. I hope he re-edits the intro just like he did for Fellowship.
Another problem I had with this film was that while it continued with it's, ""the story continues"" type endings. It really had a chance with this film to give the audience a real cliff hanger especially with the Shelob Spider sequence in the book. Instead we are treated too (but almost bored by) a overly long battle sequence that is given little time in the book but we spend the whole moving preparing for. Another problem is this whole Aragon pretending to die thing. With the next film this will begin to feel like a gimmick now that Frodo and Gandalf almost died in the first film.
I didn't like that merry and pippin spend the ENTIRE film on Ent Beard walking. It was almost laughable. I also thought that the Ents should have come to the conclusion of war at the meeting just like in the book. It makes more sense, how else could all those ents appear from out of nowhere? Didn't they know all their kind were being killed since the first film? I found that hard to believe. Merry and Pippin become so courageous and brave in the book and yet are given little to do by Jackson, that was just stupid.
Now beside all that I really did enjoy the movie. Gollum was amazing to watch, and he was my favorite character in the book so it was a real treat. But this book is my favorite of all three so I was most dissapointed with the sacrifices Jackson made. I fear that Return of the King will include many sacrifices as well, including the fact that he may take out the entire scorching of the shire, for running time sake. While this was a very long part of Return of the King (especially after a nail biting conclusion) as part of the book it deserves to be seen in the next film.
Here is my hope in these films. That the expanded version of each film be what Fellowship became. And they, in the end, will be the real trilogy that should have been seen in theatres.
Here's to a good film that wil become better by the end of 2003.",1043280000,4,3019,4.224913494809688
1469198,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: Two Towers, has much to recommend it as a outstanding adaptation of a breathtaking classic,
while (thankfully) making no pretences at being anything other than
what J. R. R. Tolkien originally meant it to be; the MIDDLE of that very intriguing tale.
Somehow, the middle book was adapted to film in such a way that one doesn't feel cheated at being able to know only part of the whole story.
  How were they able, for example, to keep its loose ends untied and its secrets still locked away -for the third and final movie to uncover;
while still allowing the viewer to come away from it feeling as if unresolved items have been solved!?!
Understandably, this middle movie can't follow the books sequence as undeviatingly
as they were able to do in the first, or the real focus of Tolkien's tale would be lost via condensed and reduced scene cuts;
in fact, the really surprising factor is how well the slim sequence switch-a rounds take place!
These surreptitious modifications do no harm to the plot, while allowing for limitations films must always face when transferring text to visual screen.
As an avid admirer of J. R. R. Tolkien's brilliant work, I can truly say that none of this trilogy has disgraced him.
The written word is finally coming to life without a flaw; and Tolkien would be proud!",1043280000,3,1318,4.676724137931035
1469199,4,B00005JKZU,"Yes, I have read all of the books and when I watch the film, I sigh every time that there is a plot point changed.  I cringe every time a character is ommited.  Every time a bit of back story is expanded at the expense of something in the book I shake my head in wonderment.
All this aside... the movie is beautiful, well directed , nicely acted and worthy of being watched over and over again.  As a Tolkien fan, I have to say that this is probably the best film adaptation that has or will ever be done of the novel.  I take solice in the fact that they add more of the cut things in the special editions.  I also take further solice in the fact that some day, with computers, some real fan of the books will be able to go back and make a 50 or so hour version of the movie that puts everything back in it's place and all the characters and dialogue.  Computers are doing wonderful things today and are only getting better.  Those characters that you watch and say, ""Boy, they almost look real, but I can tell that they aren't."", soon, hopefully, you won't be able to tell at all.  Sometimes, you can't now.  Maybe Peter Jackson will even do it.  Surely, he realizes that the original is better than his version.  My fingers are crossed, but I would recommend this film to anybody.  I agree about Faramir's changes being terrible, but personally...  who would be so confused with learning the name Mithrandir?  I sure wouldn't.",1043193600,,1429,4.323308270676692
1469200,5,B00005JKZU,"I know that I'm committing some sort of sacrilege, but I was one of the few people on the planet Earth who thought that Peter Jackson's first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was good but not great.  The pacing felt rushed, Pippin and Merry (close friends--almost family actually--of Frodo) were reduced to the hobbit equivalent of Beavis and Butthead.  Arwen, super-elf, made a brave stand at the ford instead of Frodo (I'm all for improving Arwen's character, but I still don't understand why Frodo's confrontation against the black riders was robbed from him; after all, Frodo shows something about himself in this scene).  All in all, the Tolkien purist in me thought, ""Ugh!""
That said, I'm surprised that some purist reviewers are taking shots at The Two Towers.  For my money, the Two Towers felt more in line with Tolkien's vision than the first film.  The first 90 minutes are superb.  Rohan and its inhabitants feel ""dead on,"" and there are certain moments--such as when Gandalf saves Theoden--that feel just right.  Gollum is surprisingly well-rendered.  He's the first CGI character that I felt something for.  Even Treebeard looks sharp!
Some will take issue with Jackson's changes, and I can understand this, but his changes didn't feel as arbitrary or damning as those made in the first film (Arwen rescuing Frodo, Aragorn ""letting"" Frodo escape, etc.).  There's really only one serious change made in the Two Towers: Faramir.
In the book, Faramir is the mirror opposite of his brother Boromir.  Whereas Boromir lusted after the ring to his death, Faramir shows maturity and vision by divining that Frodo and Sam are on a serious mission and letting them go.  Jackson has taken some liberties here, making Faramir something of a villain.  Fans have been outraged.  To me, I didn't care much for the change, but unlike Arwen's rescuing of Frodo in Fellowship (which I still don't understand), Faramir's change felt a bit more reasonable.  After all, film is a different medium than the printed page, and it would be difficult to capture the subtlety of Faramir and Frodo's dialogue as Faramir slowly figures things out.  Instead, Jackson has to signal things to the average viewer, and I can understand this.  In essence, Jackson exaggerates Faramir's revelation by casting him as the villain who slowly learns what his brother Boromir could not.  Yes, I too wondered why the hell the hobbits were being dragged to Gondor.  Yes, I too wondered to myself, ""What the hell is Jackson doing?""  Overall, though, I'd say it's a palatable change.
It's palatable because so much of the film works well.  Whereas Fellowship felt rushed to me (the film could have been titled ""The Fellowship of the Ring's Greatest Hits""), The Two Towers revels in its ""middle book"" stance.  Are there negatives?  Well, sure.  Treebeard's scenes with Merry and Pippin feel shortchanged, which is too bad because I was really nervous about Treebeard coming across as cheezy, but I now think he deserved *more* screen time.  There's a 15-minute lull where Arwen and Elrond are shown in flashbacks, and although I respect Jackson's decision to flesh out the Aragorn-Arwen love story (which Tolkien surprisingly ignored, even though--as Tolkien geeks know--Arwen is the only elf (save Luthien) to sacrifice immortality for love), these scenes really drag down the film.  I'd love to say to Jackson, ""Hey, man, I see what you're trying to do, and it's noble, but it just ain't working.""  Lastly, Aragorn's falling over a cliff during and orc/warg battle feels forced.  Not only does it ring as Hollywood action cliche, but we've already seen Gandalf reappear from the depths of death.  We don't want to see this same trope echoed via Aragorn.
Still, the positives outweight the negatives.  The Two Towers is a stronger picture than the first film and is actually more honest to the books--at least in terms of feel and rythym an pace.  Here's hoping that the Return of the King can continue the trend.",1043193600,32,3983,4.953313253012048

It has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. I absolutely adored Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Two Towers in spite of -- and often because of -- his changes. The changes were, after all, all the only surprises I got. I love the Warg Attack, which gave Aragorn a vulnerability and poignance that his character lacks in the books. Faramir's purity always struck me as inconsistent with the power of the ring on humans, it's great to see him a bit conflicted. The Elves arrival at Helms Deep is a perfect chance to show they didn't abandon mankind. It doesn't make sense to take the time to explain that Galadriel and company took down Sauron's old fortress Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. Of course, only readers will understand most of what I just said.

1469203,5,B00005JKZU,"I've always heard about Lord of the Rings even before i actually tried to read the books. When i read articles and stories about it i thought: Man, this Tolkien guy was a genious! A creating God in his own media. How could he created such a astonishingly complex universe with it's own history, peoples, languages and cities? After watching Fellowship and the Two towers four times each i realized that i am in love with epic movies, particulally those whose story is passed in an past or fantastic time. Braveheart, Kagemusha, Ran, Conam or even Star Wars, are movies that give us a feel of watching something greater than us, something trully magnificent. They're like the songs the bards sang in the royal courts of Europe in the Middle Ages.
As for Lord of the Rings, The Two towers abandons the pastoral tone of Fellowship and jumps head-on in the epic dimension. Now the War of the Ring has finally begun as the titanic clash between men and uruk-hai in Helm's Deep and the attack by the ents on Isengard make clear. Now the moments of thruth have finally come and the Midlle-Earth will be shaken to its very foundations. When Two Towers ends we, poor mortals that never read the books can only wonder what will happen in Return of the King, knowing only that will be even bigger than what is shown in The two towers. Since people who will be reading this review will very probably know the movie's story by hard i prefer to focus on two very diferent yet very similar characters: King Thoden and Smagol/Gollum. Thoden is a man, king of Rohan and a brave and noble warrior, and Gollum is a repulsive scavenging creature that has been twisted and deformed by the Ring of Power for centuries. But what links these two characters you ask? Their humanity. Gollum was once a hobbit like Frodo or Sam but has been transformed by the ring into a near-animal. Finding Frodo and Sam and joining them as a guide in their journey to Mordor awakens something in him that laid dorment and forgotten for too long. The faith Frodo has that he can be different, that he can redeem himself is what makes Smagol loyal to the goals of the Quest. His struggle with himself, with Gollum, that is nothing but the savagery and survival instict wich dominated him for so long, makes Smagol both a tragic and touching character. King Thoden on the other hand is a man on an existencial crisis. After being spelled by Saruman and manipulated by Grma Thoden awokes from his apathy and lethargy to find his beloved land being devastated. The death of his only son and heir and the grief that follows  it  contributes for his sense of displacement and confusion. He tries to do his best but still don't know who is or what he must do. And then, when all seems lost and hopeless he finally discovers that he must fight to protect his people from the horrors of genocide, and side by side with Aragorn, Legolas and his lieutenants he rides out to battle once more to meets its destiny.

I am one of the millions of people who have grown up with Lord of the Rings and consider it one of the literary masterpieces of our time. With the Fellowship of the ring, he succeeded in capturing the spirit of the book and introduced the spectacular world of Middle Earth.
In this film, Jackson continues to capture the spirit of the trilogy, but ups the ante a considerably. The sheer scale of the battles in this movie, the triumph of capturing Gollum and the depth of the characters and their bond to one another is not lost in the incredible cinematography and effects work in this movie.
For book fans, prepare yourself for an excursion from the tale you are used to. Fan sites cover this in more detail than I can here, but suffice to say, there are some large deviations from the original story. Regardless of the changes to the middle of the story, the tale leaves everything where it needs to be for the final movie which we have to wait until December to see.

1469316,5,B00005JKZU,"When I love a film this much, it is difficult for me to write a review.  I'm afraid I'll lose my perspective and not be able to see the film for what it is.  So, I made sure that I saw ""The Twin Towers"" twice in theaters, and was lucky enough to live in a city where the second showing was the IMAX version.  As you can imagine, that was totally mind-blowing!

A fan of Tolkien for the last 35 years, I was unafraid of the changes that director Peter Jackson would need to make to continue the story line without burdening it with too many characters.  Anxious to see how he handled the split of the fellowship and its parallel plots, I felt that this was one of the strongest elements of the film! Each of the three plots had a sense of urgency, clear transitions existed between them, and, although the support of the Rohan and the Battle for Helm's Deep far outweighed the progress of Frodo and the journey of Merry, Pippin and the Ents, Jackson kept us riveted in all three.  Many Tolkien loyalists have taken the changes, especially those involving Faramir, as a departure from what Tolkien originally intended.  In contrast, I believe that Jackson and the screenwriters did a masterful job of simplifying, maintaining the good vs. evil theme, and keeping the pace of the movie on target.  There are no plot changes that subtracted from the overall thrill of the film experience for me.

There is no question that the cinematography, costumes, compelling and sweeping vistas of the vast plain of Middle Earth don't take a back seat to characterization and plot in the movie.  The overall visual experience is one of startled wonder, especially the capture of the gloom and fearfulness of Mordor and the evil that has overtaken Isengard.  The music is a perfect counterpoint to the visual senses.  Jackson allows his cast of strong players to once again assume their roles, but no one or group of characters, no plot line, no special effects outbalance the setting.  It feels as though we are again watching the same genius that compelled George Lucas, when he made his ""middle"" or ""bridge"" piece (The Empire Strikes Back) the best of his film trilogy so many years ago.  For me, the success of this film revolved around three startling elements:

1. Gollum.  Gollum is a masterwork, in a film year that has seen some rapid developments and successes in computer aided special effects.  Gollum, in the work of Tolkien, is the central force, a character that embodies the elements of good and evil in his life and in his actions.  In the book, the dual characterization of Gollum (evil) vs. Smeagle (good) is difficult to follow, through their discourse.  When the visualization is added on film, with a masterful voice (and, I'm told, a huge contribution to the special effects through his own body language) by Andy Smerkis, the character of Gollum (as evil as we know him to be) and the misguided creature befriended by Frodo meld their elements successfully.  To say that Gollum is brought to life in a believable, charismatic way, is to understate how brilliantly the character worked on film.

2. The Battle for Helm's Deep.  Never has a powerful and evil enemy come to life on the screen in the way that Jackson portray's Saruman's army.  The sense of doom that permeates the stronghold of Helm's Deep is felt throughout the audience.  The reliance of the world of men on the impermeability of the Helm's Deep fortress is put to the test, and Jackson gives us nearly an hour of incredibly intense battle, punctuated with views of the women and children trapped in the fortress.  Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas all play their roles perfectly in the height of battle, and the viewer is locked to the edge of their seats with every passing moment.

3. For me, the signature moment of the film is the white light arrival of Gandalf on the magnificent steed Shadowfax.  With me, the theater audience cheered and clapped...the instant that he is seen by Aragorn, the surge of feeling and power felt on the screen in that second, will stay with me for a long time.

I think there are no words left to say that won't duplicate what I've already said - 5 stars only because 6 were not available...The Two Towers is a work of breathtaking achievement!",1042934400,27,4247,4.6644295302013425

In Two Towers there are several different storylines that if handled badly can covalute the narrative. The editors did a great job in keeping the pacing up and the seperate adventures clear and concise. Other reviews have given the outline of the story rather well but special mention should be given to the character of Gollum who almost steals the film.
Joseph Campbell wrote on how certain themes in the mythology of almost all cultures are universal. The wandering prince, the battle of good vs evil, the commoner called to perform above and beyond, a band on a mission, etc etc. These themes are in both the Lord of the Rings books and the two movies are masterfully drawn.

  The technology is there to do it, but Peter Jackson and his screenwriters did not do the story justice.
  Yet if this will bring people to the truth, if this will get people to read the books and appreciate the genius of J.R.R. Tolkien then it will deserve the one star I give the movie(s).",1042761600,11,414,4.1375
1469320,5,B00005JKZU,"After growing up on Star Wars, I was wary of the middle epic in a trilogy.  Episode V of Star Wars always seemed flat and discouraging.  However, I left the theater after The Two Towers walking on air.
Simply put, The Two Towers was magnificent.  I battled my way through parts of The Fellowship of the Ring because of the noise, the violence, and the constantly changing scenes and ideas.  You had to get used to so many characters and landscapes and homes and cultures--literally an entirely different world--while at the same time following an incredible plot.  With TTT, however, I truly felt like a part of the fellowship.  I knew the characters, knew their mission, and knew the bad guys by heart.  People may say that TTT has no beginning and no end, but that is exactly how it is meant to be.  It ties in perfectly with the Fellowship and ends suspensfully for the much awaited Return of the King.
This movie followed the book fairly well, although I personally was furious over the confusing part Eowyn played.  Admittedly, I like her far better than Arwen, but she was not meant to be so important or personal in the book.  Also, everyone is complaining about Faramir.  My father simply says that Faramir was a spoiled brat in the book anyway, so the same message gets across in the end.  I'm not excusing Jackson for messing up a character, but let us wait and see what he does with Faramir in the end.  And of course Gollum was terrific.  We'd just begun the first scenes with him and my dad (who has read the trilogy 16 times over) turned to me with a huge smile on his face.  Yes, Gollum was perfect.  My dad thought Wormtongue might have been the best actor in the movie, for his small part was so magnificently played that he shone.  Theoden was OK; not strong, but he wasn't supposed to be.  I also thought Sam did a terrific job.  He's so simple and yet so honest and true... and so wise.  The last scenes almost brought tears to my eyes when Frodo and Sam imagine young hobbits asking about their adventures in the future.  Legolas was great; flipping onto that horse is an art only possible of an elf.  Skiing down the stairs of Helm's Deep on a shield was a little corny, but he still did a great job.  Aragorn also appeared as a very strong character, but all the love scenes with Arwen got on my nerves.  His strength and the king within him are unfolding.  And Gimli was wonderful!  The comic relief in such a long and furious movie was welcomed with much laughter all over the theater.  Gandalf did a great job, although I miss his intimacy from the Fellowship.  He is a perfect picture of Christ, rising from the dead, casting out the evil spirit of Sauron (aka satan), and always coming to the rescue in a glory of splendor.  Frodo did an excellent job as well; thumbs up to Elijah Wood.  He had a hard part to play and can never come across as the most colorful character in it.  Yet Wood doesn't seem to care; he is more concerned with acurately portraying Frodo Baggins, and he does an excellent job.
Basically, this trilogy is the movie of the decade, if not the movie of our century.  Well done, Peter Jackson.  What about The Hobbit?",1042675200,3,3166,4.422145328719723
1469321,3,B00005JKZU,"While I enjoyed this second installment in the LOTR trilogy, I left the theatre with significant qualms about this film.  My concerns center around the changes made to Tolkien's story and characters. Apparently, Peter Jackson thought that Tolkien's story wasn't compelling enough in its original form, so he decided to rewrite portions of it.
Jackson also made some changes in the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, but the changes made in that film were relatively minor, and understandable as part of an effort to cut the story down to manageable length and trim a few tangential characters. Here, however, portions of the story are changed wholesale, and plot elements are grossly embellished.
Some of Jackson's tinkering is not all that troublesome.  To my thinking, the added scenes elaborating on the romance between Aragorn and Arwen were not objectionable, since they flesh out a plot line alluded to in the books. Also, the comic relief provided by Gimli does offer a laugh or two in appropriate places, and seem in the spirit (if not the letter) of Gimli's blustery literary character.  The depiction of Gollum as a split personality is inspired by material in the book, and is a compelling realization of this despicable and ultimately sad character.
Other changes made, however, are much harder to fathom. One example should suffice.  In the book, when Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli meet Theoden in his hall at Edoras, the elderly Theoden is tired and doddering, and under the influence of a pernicious courtier, ""Wormtongue"".  Wormtongue has been whispering bad advice into Theoden's ear, filling him with doubts and indecision.  Gandalf, aware of what has been going on, confronts Wormtongue and denounces him to the king, while working his magic (somewhat slowly and subtly) to reinvigorate Theoden.  Although (as Tolkien reminds us several times), Theoden remains an aged man after his ""cure"", he gains strength, and as he does so, his mind clears and he begins to doubt Wormtongue. We learn only later in the story that Wormtongue was working on Saruman's behalf to undermine Rohan.
In Jackson's version, we meet Theoden as hideously aged and decrepit (if not almost unconscious).  Gandalf undertakes a sort of exorcism of Theoden, in dramatic fashion, and in the course of this it becomes clear that Theoden's body is actually possessed by Saruman.  While conducting this exorcism, Aragorn et al. physically scuffle with Wormtongue and the members of Theoden's household.  At the moment Saruman is expelled from Theoden's body, the scene cuts to Orthanc, where we see Saruman crash to the floor. Theoden then morphs into a hale middle-aged man.
This illustrates how a scene from the book that could have been depicted with subtlety, drama and mysticism was turned into a farcical exorcism, with everything except a spinning head and pea soup.
An important dramatic element of Tolkien's story is how the elderly Theoden, with a little help from Gandalf, needs to summon the strength and willpower to fight the good fight one last time in order to redeem humanity. In Jackson's version, the exorcised Theoden's continued doubts and soul-searching don't make sense if he has been freed of his ""demon"", and don't seem to square with his middle-aged vigor.  Furthermore, the changes create problems with the plotline. If Saruman possessed Theoden's body, why would Saruman need to have Wormtongue whispering in Theoden's ear?
There are at least half a dozen more examples of this. While there was much in the movie to enjoy, a number of us are stunned that Jackson was arrogant enough to think he could improve Tolkien's work. We can only hope that the ""extended version"" fixes a few of these flaws, and in any event that the third film is more faithful to the book.",1042675200,5,3786,5.031948881789138
1469322,5,B00005JKZU,"Last year's The Fellowship Of The Ring, director Peter Jackson's first entry in his three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, provided little cause for complaint. At once thoroughly cinematic and faithful to the spirit (if not always the letter) of Tolkien's book, it presented Middle Earth as an immersive experience, a world in which every aspect is realized in minute detail. Fellowship made the impossible believable, and without draining the magical happenings, fantastical locations, and uncanny creatures of their wonder, it also never abandoned a sense of dramatic and thematic weight. As embodied by a well-chosen cast, Fellowship's characters had all the depth Tolkien gave them on the page (and sometimes more), and their quest to rid the world of a ring of absolutely corrupting power took on greater urgency as the film progressed toward a cliffhanger that set up its second part. The film has plenty of action, as soulful hobbits Elijah Wood and Sean Astin make their way toward Mordor, friends Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan find unlikely allies deep in a forest, and the dwarf/elf/human team of John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Viggo Mortensen attempts to defend a struggling kingdom from the forces of Christopher Lee.
What makes Towers so staggering is the way it brings the full scope of Jackson's adaptation into focus. Without missing a beat in three hours, the film shifts from epic to lyrical and back. It portrays a harrowingly intense battle one moment, then pauses for a father's grief over his son's death the next. It shows in frightening detail the engines of war, then links those engines to the bloodshed they exact and the ecological destruction that made them possible.
What Fellowship suggested, Towers elucidates. It's thrilling as swords clash and arrows fly, but it also never abandons the underlying sadness of Tolkien's world, in which each victory only forestalls the transition to a meaner age. Next year, The Return Of The King will bring the story to a close. Until then, it feels almost like a privilege to watch the unfolding of a tale from a fantastic imagined past rich with resonance for the human present.",1042675200,3,2182,5.063888888888889
1469323,5,B00005JKZU,"Anyone who thinks that the movie The Two Towers stays more faithful to the book has either never read the trilogy, or needs to have their head examined.  Peter Jackson himself has said that this movie departs the most from Tolkien out of the three movies.
That said, this film is amazing.  The Tolkien purists will have a hard time with the departures, (and there are many), but overall this is overshadowed by excellent writing, acting, and Gollum.  He really is the show stealer in this, and for that reason I recommend seeing this twice.  I don't think there are any movies (even Star Wars) that I would recommend repeated viewings, but I think its necessary in this case to fully appreciate this movie.
Gollum has been so well crafted and directed that it is entirely possible to get over the fact that he is 1's and 0's, and relate to him as simply another major character of the story.  I found that the first time I watched this movie, I was staring at the edges and periphery of Gollum's character, to try to see the trickery being used, which was distracting.  The second time I saw it, I was able to stop analyzing the visual information, and just relate to him as an actor.  In that respect, Two Towers was better when viewed the second time.  This movie is worth seeing only on the basis of having revolutionized the CG character.  No other movie has come close to cunningly portraying a real physical presence of a CG character, gotten the lip-synching perfect, and having the character be an integral and entertaining part of the main plot.
Other than that, there are great special effects, wide panoramic locations, and phenomenal action sequences that one would come to expect from this series.  My personal favorite action sequence is when the Ents lay seige to Isengard.  It may not be a conventional battle sequence, but it is very original and shows a lot of thought to the idea of living trees in battle.
I will say that I did prefer the intimacy and characterizations that made Fellowship of the Ring so enjoyable.  So in that case, the first movie is still my favorite, but this one is just as good.",1042675200,5,2122,4.584656084656085

1469441,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers which is the second installment of Tolkein's 3-part book has captured the audience's attention. The movie is the best of all time. Better than The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers picks up where The Fellowship left off. Sam and Frodo are traveling through the Emyn Muil on their way to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power. The last of the Fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli) are chasing after the mighty Uruk-Hai who have taken Merry and Pippin.
Jackson does an excellent job of picking up right where Fellowship left off. He doesn't give a re-cap which is great. The beginning of the movie has a surprise to those who have not read the books. I won't ruin the movie for those many people.
The movie starts with Sam and Frodo who are traveling through the Emyn Muil to Mordor. They meet up with the creature Gollum whom, as we have heard in Fellowship is possessed by the ring. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him swear by the ring, his precious, that he will lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor (Minas Morgul).
Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are on the trail of the Sauruman's Uruk-Hai who have captured Merry and Pippin. Aragorn's efforts will lead the three to the a camp set up by their quarry. Apparently there was a struggle and it seems that Merry and Pippin are dead. But wait! Aragorn discovers tracks that lead into the Fangorn forest.
Merry and Pippin have escaped from the Uruk-Hai, but are pursued into the Fangorn forest by an Orc who is desperate to have them for dinner. Merry and Pippin encounter the Ent, Treebeard, who then leads them to a safe spot.
Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the tracks and come across Treebeard who then leads them to the White Man who is surprise!
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Rohan to seek council with King Theoden whose mind is being poisened by Sauruman's filthy henchmen Grima Wormtounge.
Sam and Frodo are stuck in the Dead Marshes. Frodo questions Gollum about how he came across the ring and also convicts Gollum of once being a Hobbit. Gollum then fights with his other self(his good self) Smeagol. Smeagol in the end wins. They arrive at the Black Gate but it's nearly impossible to get past. Smeagol suggests a new route. Frodo agrees but Sam has his doubts.
King Theoden receives word of the advancing forces of Sauruman's Uruk-Hai and has ordered that everyone evacuate and move to Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel with him. On the way, Theoden's small force is attacked by a group of Orcish scouts. Aragorn falls off a cliff and is presumed dead.
Sam and Frodo have been captured by Faramir and his band. They are taken to Osgilith. Faramir is taken by the ring as did his brother Boromir.
King Theoden arrives at Helm's Deep and awaits the oncoming horde of the Uruk-Hai. The battle of Helm's Deep is the most astonishing feat the CG has to offer. The battle is intense and is depicted very well and it even invites some humor from our little hero Gimli.
Merry and Pippin try to convince Treebeard to go to war with Isengard. Only when Treebeard surveys the land surrounding Isengard (trees have been destroyed and leveled as far as the eye can see) does he decide to go to war.
Back at Helm's Deep, the victory is hopeless for Rohan as the Orcs pummel the Keep. Just when all hope is lost, surprise!
Sam and Frodo are taken to Minas Tirith which is being attacked by the Nazgul and the forces of Mordor. Faramir lets Sam, Frodo and Smeagol go. Smeagol again has another fight with his evil twin, Gollum. Gollum wins and decides to kill Frodo and Sam by taking them to HER. The End
The Two Towers is a really great film and I recommend anyone and everyone to see it before it's too late. Even those who are not Lord of the Rings fans will appreciate this movie for what it is. The cinematography is great and the storyline is true to the book and the CG are awesome and breathtaking. Jackson has done an awesome job. I'm counting the days till The Two Towers comes out on DVD probably around August same as Fellowship and I'm also counting the days till The Return of the King comes into theaters this December.

Isn't it interesting that in 2002-03 the big hit has moral clarity and is written buy a guy named Tolkien! Maybe classic storytelling is the most universal and the most profitable. Take careful note of this Hollywood! This looks great on DVD!",1042588800,,598,4.99

At almost every turning, this movie bastardized and embellished Tolkien's ""The Two Towers.""  They changed almost everything!  And peter jackson committed a cardinal sin!  He villanized Faramir!  Faramir was one of the most noble characters in ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Aragorn loved him for his true sight and inner strength.  In the movie, Faramir tried to take Frodo and Sam to Gondor!  What?  Where did that come from?  Why did you do that, peter?  Why?  There was no reason for that.  In the book, Faramir did not know about the ""ring of power,"" let alone know that Frodo had it.  He only knew that Frodo held something secret and that it was vital and necessary for him to go to Mordor.  He trusted Frodo.
Faramir was my favorite character in the whole trilogy (the books).  I walked out after seeing how peter jacksh! t had him portrayed.  I did not see the end, and will not go see the third movie.  I'm ashamed that I joined the fan club.  J. R. R. Tolkien would NEVER have allowed this!
Why did peter-eater jackson change the outcome of the Ent-moot?  What purpose was served?  Why change that?  Why?  Why did peter change Eomir's fate?  Eomir didn't turn vagabond - he was imprisoned.  He was released when Theodin was released from Wormtongue's spell.  Eomir was imprisoned for letting Aragorn go and loaning him two horses.  In the movie, Eomir was already an outcast vagabond when he met Aragorn.  Why change that?  What purpose was served?
That was only a few instances.  There were many more.  peter jackson can have his movies, but no more of my money.  Thank God I never purchased the DVD!  I'll stick to the books.  They are more than enough.  Hopefully I can find a new edition of hardbacks without peter jackass's movie ... all over the jacket.
It's just sad that peter jackson took a personal advantage over the fact that so many people were clueless to the true storyline.  What a pity that all these people have needlessly been misled.  What will happen when they go back and read the books for the first time?  Will they be disappointed that Tolkien didn't tell it like peter did?  Is that what donkey jackson had in mind?  Probably.  What a cheap trick.

1469447,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is in every way a worthy continuation of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Tolkien trilogy. Just as finely wrought as ""The Fellowship of the Rings,"" yet even more fiercely dramatic, ""The Two Towers"" hurls us into the action where the first movie left off, with the fellowship scattered in different directions. Jackson moves gracefully between the three parallel stories, giving the audience just enough time to catch its breath before the next dazzling set piece. Particularly dazzling are the Battle of Helm's Deep, a thrilling extravaganza that takes up the film's last hour, and the character of Gollum, simultaneously hideous, sinister and pitiful, a brilliant collaboration between actor Andy Serkis and Jackson's crackerjack team of computer artists. The special effects are state-of-the-art; the actors show superb teamwork, all holding up their ends while modestly serving the purposes of Jackson and Tolkien. Once again Jackson makes unobtrusive but definite changes to Tolkien's story, particularly in the form of some romantic complications for Aragorn (Tolkien, as everyone knows by now, fastidiously avoided the mushy stuff). But Jackson's choices are always astute, serving to open up the story cinematically and make it play better to a movie audience. Once again, Jackson is particularly careful to preserve Tolkien's moral vision--namely, that there are clear choices between good and evil, and that the will to wield power is the will to do evil. There are enough parallels between the action of ""The Two Towers"" and the current world situation to give us pause, just as there were between ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the insanity of the world wars Tolkien himself lived through. Tolkien always denied any intentions of allegory, and indeed he didn't need allegory; all he needed was insight into human character. Combining this with masterful scholarship and an agile imagination, he created a fantasy world unique in 20th-century literature. Jackson, in turn, has paid marvelous cinematic tribute to this fantasy world, far above what any audience could expect.",1042329600,,2122,5.3373134328358205
1469448,5,B00005JKZU,"I had missed the opportunity to see part one of this trilogy in the theaters, although I am VERY happy and pleased with the new 4-DVD Special Extended Edition version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I told myself I WOULD, God willing, see this movie in theaters and boy am I glad I did.
Here then, is THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS as brought to the screen by Peter Jackson, Phillippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, Howard Shore, and their crew of merry troubadours. There is no break in action from the first film to the second.  This picks right up where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING left off. Upon seeing the opening grand vistas of the mountains of New Zealand and revisting Gandalf's last-stand battle with the infamous Balrog, I knew I was in for a treat, one that kept me glued to my seat for the full three hours of this movie. Those three hours seemed to just fly by and not once was I bored with the film.
Granted: The visuals for this film are stunning, no matter what they depict. The music, once again supplied by Howard Shore, dances expertly being noble, exciting, chilling and tender without missing a beat. I loved the use of choir in this work, and especially the Norwgian fiddle used in the theme for the people of Rohan. All the music for me, however was absolutely first rate and further added to the supsense and beauty and high adventure of the film.
Granted: The parts of Gandalf and Saruman, respectively, in this movie are small. However, both Sir Ian McKellan (Gandalf The White) and the incomparable Christopher Lee (Saruman The White) manage to give to their scenes an undeniable air of power, nobility, and in their respective cases, tenderness (for Gandalf) and menace (for Saruman). Also, though her role as Arwen is small here, Liv Tyler, to me, shines in it. I LOVED the scenes between both her and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and her and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) In both cases Arwen's scenes were tender and provided a real emotional impact. I felt the weight of her choice as she struggled yet more with the decision between a mortal life with the love of Aragorn versus the immortal life of an elfin princess. I felt for the plight of the Elves as they further progressed towards their final departure from the world of Middle Earth.
All of the acting here in my view was wonderful. Viggo Mortensen shines as the heroic and noble Aragorn. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are a pair you can really relate to as the stalwart little Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his trusty sidekick Samwise Gamgee. Brad Dourif made my skin crawl as the dastardly Grima Wormtongue. Bernard Hill came across as a tough but tender father figure of sorts as Theoden, King of Rohan (the scene where he mourns the death of his son had my own eyes burning with tears). Miranda Otto was apprropriately  stately and regal as Eowyn, who proved she was no mere damsel in distress, but could handle herself quite well. Making a welcome return as Gimli, son of Gloin, John Rhys-Davies strikes the perfect balance between comedic and tough-as-nails. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) were also a joy to behold again. Everybody did a great job.
Special kudos must be given to Andy Serkis (The voice of Gollum/Smeagol) I really sympathized as he watched the unfolding of the sad life of the little creature so horribly twisted by the dark powers of Sauron's One Ring of Power. Andy Serkis really pulled off the role of a poor little creature driven to utter madness and forced by this to be thought of as a monster by virtually ever other inhabitant of Middle Earth.
I found the love triangle worked well. Arwen's time with Aragorn was passionate but done with extreme taste. Likewise, Eowyn's affection and love were obvious, without her throwing herself at Aragorn, AND Aragorn's fidelity to Arwen despite Eowyn's attention was very touching to me
The Battle Of Helms Deep AND the complete and utter TRASHING of Isengard by the Ents (with SOME help from Merry and Pippin) were sequences that both amused, impressed and kept my attention riveted to the full. (I loved seeing Saruman's fortress getting its proverbial buttocks kicked) and the Helm's Deep battle was engaging in the best sense of the word. The Nazgul (the ring-wraiths)  were as chilling as ever, even though their appearance was brief. It was made all the more chilling because the fact that they rode on the backs of winged creatures means that water is no longer a barrier(as it sometimes was when they rode the black horses) and that they could travel greater distances muc faster than before. Treebeard and the Ents looked convincingly real, and John-Rhys-Davies vocals for Treebeard gave that character a gruff nobility that on the whole was entirely appropriate for that character.
In short, this movie is no less than the continuation of a trilogy that is a cinematic masterpiece. In terms of visuals, music, acting, pace and sheer entertainment, it left me breathless and makes the wait for THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING even more taxing and agonizing. I say, bring it on. This was a great film, and I for one am very eager and happy to see how the final chapter of this awesom movie trilogy plays itself out. When it is done, I am totally convinced that we will have one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time on our hands. Go. See it. Enjoy it. It's an easy film to enjoy, and even an easy film to love, if you have the courage to let your heart be touched and your imagination carried away to the awesome cinematic world that is Middle Earth, brought expertly from page to screen by a crew that knows and obviously loves what they're doing. Peace, and God bless you and yours, always.",1042329600,,5703,4.638971315529179
1469592,5,B00005JKZU,"I just went and saw ""The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers"" tonight, for the second time.. and it (not surprisingly) was even better than the previous time. The first installment of the trilogy was very impressive, but the second is just plain fun. Despite some drawn out points of the film, I never lost interest.. not even for a moment. The battle at 'Helm's Deep' was amazing. Throughout the entire movie (the 2nd time), I was so enthusiastic about that whole war sequence to begin. This movie has such imaginative characters, and such saturatingly deep development into the story; you'll leave the theater wishing the final movie was out already.",1042070400,,650,4.8125

I've seen it three times and plan to see it again and again!  And ""Smeegle"" (my apologies to those who know how to spell it) was so cute!  I loved him!  Sure, he was evil at times, but really, he was a charming creature.  I have never read the books, so I'm don't care if they changed anything.  As someone who saw just the movies, this was the best movie ever!  I'm not saying it's better but it's just as good as the first one and we all know how great that was.

1469595,5,B00005JKZU,"A year ago when I saw LoTR: FotR, I was completely blown away.  I'd never read Tolkein but I do enjoy many things derived from his works (Dungeons and Dragons being one of them), and I must say I couldn't get enough.  After the DVD came out I watched it nearly every day, and after the extended edition came out I did the same.  So, at the Two Towers loomed, I drooled in anticipation.  I waited in line for 30 minutes to get into that movie (as opposed to the 2 hours I waited to see The Phantom Menace which, in my opinion, was not nearly worth waiting that long) and when I got in I trembled.  After watching sub-par trailers (X-Men 2 being the only beacon of hope; expect ... trailers about a tooth fairy, some Disney movie, Pirates of the Carribean [WTF] and Terminator 3 [keeping in mind that James Cameron's Terminator is moving on now without James attached at all]) the movie jumped right in, and the Tolkein geeks applauded.
  Two hobbits continue en route to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, Two other hobbits are carried off by walking trees (a notion that seemed ridiculous at the beginning, but made OH so much sense by the end) and the remainder of the fellowship joins the people of Rohan in a desperate struggle to fend off Saruman's army at Helm's Deep.  Frodo (Masterfully played by Elijah Wood) continues to shoulder the burdens of the evil that bearing the One Ring despite the fact that he is tired and looks extremely worn - a notion that Jackson and co. convey perfectly.  Samwise (Sean Astin) continues to be Frodo's balance and friend, and in my opinion the best actor in the films so far.  The two are joined by Gollum, and I have 2 things to say of this performance.  One, anyone who says that 'he looks real' is wrong; he is CGI through and through.  Two, the performance that Andy Serkis gives for Gollum is nothing short of Oscar-worthy.  Brilliant.  WETA and Serkis both deserve awards for bringing a very real and dark life to the screen in Gollum.
  Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Ryhs-Davies) Pursue Saruman's evil orc soldiers into Rohan after Merry and Pippin.  They get tangled in the struggle to save Rohan and her people from Saruman, and the climatic battle is fought at Helm's Deep.  One shot before the Helm's deep sequence sums it up for me; when Merry and Pippin are riding atop TreeBeard the Ent, and see the armies leaving Isengard; I let out a loud when I saw the sheer size.  The Battle at Helm's Deep was spectacular, and for not a moment were my eyes not glued to the screen (At first light on the 5th day, look to the east - that was awesome).
  Now, I am in no regard a Tolkein purist and have never even looked at the books.  In defense of and in opposition to Tolkein purists I say the following:
 - Reading your reviews tells me that Faramir's character was not supposed to be what it was and that he instead releases Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their path to Mordor; I think Tolkein's intent to show that there are men that are worthy of nobility, but Jackson and co. want to focus the nobility of men on Aragorn and Aragorn alone, so I think that's why they did it.
 -  I am not sure why Jackson wanted to hold this until the Return of the King, I think ending the film right after that would have made the darkness and anticipation even moreso for those who have not read the books (like myself).  I mean, leaving both the book (as I understand it anyway) and the film versions of FotR not knowing if Gandalf was really alive helped alot, and doing the same to Frodo would have been a boost.
 - Finally, I am a published author, currently adapting my works to screenplay to see if I can get a studio to bite.  All of your arguments about not being faithful to Tolkein's written texts are founded because you want to see everything up there; but take it from someone who knows, you cannot make a mirror of a book for the screenplay.  It just wouldn't work.  Studios and screenwriters have to change elements to make it more appealing to the movie-going audience, and they have to either heighten those scenes that add drama and intensity, or they have to change or delete those scenes that just don't serve the story.  You can take as long as necessary to read a book, but filmmakers cannot take so long.  They have to convey the story that you maybe took a week to read into a couple hours.  Trust me, it just isn't possible.  So, try not to be too hard on Jackson and Co.; they did a fantastic job and made films that are unbelievably good.",1041984000,2,4545,4.3971291866028706
1469596,3,B00005JKZU,"If I had to really choose between the first and second LOTR movies so far, I'd really have to say this: The first film was better in that it was closer to the events in the book (yes I know Tom Bombadil was missing, that's not the point). The second film, in terms of cinematography and action is pretty much superior. But I like the book better.
The critics say that the biggest problem with ""Two Towers"" is that, as with the book, it has no beginning and no end. The characters are not reintroduced, and the quest is not explained. It's not meant to be. That said: see the first movie or at least read the first book before you see this. I found that the big problem was one constantly had with readers watching adapted films: The characters and some of the places (I.E. The winged Nazgul, the Ents, and Helm's Deep, among other things) were not exactly the way I would have represented them. But, the ways in which they are represented are amazing. Another beef: They tend to focus on three members of the original fellowship: Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn. The parts of the hobbits are just as big, and weren't capitalized on enough. The tone of the entire film is much more dark and hopeless than one normally likes to find in a movie. Finally, a good chunk of the original book is taken out, and left for the third film. But, enough about the technicalities. On to the good stuff:
The battle sequences! My sweet Lord, they were AMAZING! Huge arial shots of Orcs that we're certain are CGI, only because they are too amazing and breathtaking in scale to be real. But they are amazingly realistic. Also, on comedic relief: The director knows very well that this is a very gloomy and hopeless story. So, he puts in a good dose of black humor. During a fight amongst a group of Orcs, their leader takes a look at the carcasses killed, saying ""Meat's back on the menu, boys!"" We have several funny moments having to do with Gimli's height problem. Not to mention the many funny parts presented by Gollum. Yes, we are supposed to be wary of him, but, just take one look at the dopey, very much schizophrenic creature, and he's so weird that you have to laugh a bit.
So, though Tolkein purists will have a bit of a beef with some of the storyline (Aragorn, Arwen, and Eowynn: The love triangle that may or may not go away), this is, all together, a pretty awesome film, yet a somewhat disappointing interpretation.",1041897600,3,2411,4.457013574660634
1469597,2,B00005JKZU,"I was looking forward to the sequel of Peter Jackson's comedy classic. How long before Frodo would fall over followed by Sam's dutiful reminder of him of his Christian name? About twenty minutes into the film, as it happened. Are the guys slipping? But any fears of a repeat of the uncontrollable and embarrassing giggling I helplessly released during 'Fellowship' proved unfounded. This is because it's hard to smile while your teeth are juddering against each other. Yes, my sister's kid and I had ventured once more into Siberia, that is the cavernous bowels of cinema one at my local multiplex, home of the most demented air conditioning system yet invented by man or hobbit. In fact, I suspected the 'hand' of Sauren at work, in a malicious attempt to poison the audience against good filming. He needn't have bothered, as it turned out. The kid was wearing a T-shirt, thermal top, jumper and a jacket. Despite being under more clobber than Muhammad Ali throughout his entire career, he still requested another jacket be flung on top of him. I, in a gesture of soon to be futile machismo, was merely wearing a super thick wooly jumper. After 30 minutes of towering towers, my nose had gone numb and my hand flailed wildly under the seat for that St Bernard with the barrel of brandy. These arctic conditions clouded my impression of the entire picture. First, Gandalf's epic fight with the fire demon Bolrog at the film's opening. ""G..g...give him a free t..ticket to cinema one!"" I exhorted in vain to the big G as the ferocious battle raged. Trust me, Bolrog's flames would die quickly. Gandalf rather unhelpfully anounced himself as no longer monickered 'The Grey' but 'The White', which meant he kept disappearing for large stretches of the film due to the icicles hanging down from my eyebrows. Henceforth, as the reels turned, every utterance by the game cast only seemed to speak of our cruel predicament. ""So...pale...so cold"" said Grima Wormtongue while carressing Eowyn's cheek. ""Like the last chill before spring...."" Boy, you said it, Chewie. I mean, Grimi. When the gang perchanced upon Theoden, he looked like he had already spent three hours in cinema one. Luckily, Gandalf thaws him out. Hey, how about sending us a bolt, Gandy? We're dying in here! We longed for the stretches of dull, incomprehensible dialogue between Theoden and other middle Earthers in his throne room to meander on and on, as there were torches flickering in the background. At one point the kid started flailing wildly with his arms. Was he incensed by Frodo walking to the left of a rock instead of the right as depicted in Tolkien's novel, or was this a last desperate attempt to ward off frostbite? This relentless cold reminded me of Tarkovsky's marvelous 'Andrei Rublev', a Russian fresco set largely in medieval winter. Tarkovsky would rarely cut, instead opting for a series of masterful and subtle long takes with an eye to background detail that united man with earth to such an extent that the screen appeared to be an open door in which one could almost step straight back in time. Jackson does the opposite, resulting in a muddled, uninvolving picture. Kudos though to Sean Astin, whose performance transcends even the misguided 'a word from our sponser' speech at the film's close. Although it was a freezing day, it was nice to step back out through the cinema doors into the warm. The conclusion I have come to is that you definately need two towers. One for the Elves and the other for several thousand pairs of thermal underpants.",1041811200,7,3542,4.8369028006589785
1469598,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers (TTT) is NOT a sequel to the mind-blowing Fellowship of the Ring, but a second part of a 3 act play. So does it live up to it's high expectations? Yes, the magic is still here, but is much darker (and bloodier) this time. Director Peter Jackson puts up right back where we left and doesn't look back. 3 hours later our mind is once again filled with dramatic, vast images that are instant cinematic history and legend. This is the fabric that geek legend is wove of.
Jackson and his team have said they took the most liberties with the story in TTT, and it definitely shows. I'll predict some major backlash from Tolkien purists. I can see both side's arguments and probably lean toward the purists side. There are some changes that obviously put some story angles further up (the Aragorn/Arwen romance) and change some characters (Faramir). The changes still work in the movie and someone who hasn't read the books countless times (like myself) wouldn't think the story doesn't work because it works for both arenas of people.
When we left them, the Fellowship was breaking. The hobbits, Frodo and his loyal companion Sam, have ran off to Mordor while Merry and Pippin have been captured by a group of Uruk-Hai warriors. The man Aragorn, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli have decided to try to rescue the hobbits that are captured and let the ring-bearer off to his task. Gandalf the Grey had fallen into the abyss and Boromir had perished at the hands of the Uruks.
The film kicks into high gear right off with a bang starting that I won't reveal. It then darts back to our Mordor bound hobbits, who are all but lost in the vast wastelands of their trek, but they aren't alone. The creature Gollum finally reveals himself and agrees to lead them to the Black Gate with a promise on his ""precious"", the one ring. The 3 hunters (man, elf, dwarf) chase their prey across the lands of Rohan where they only seem to meet despair and hopelessness.
Gollum is a totally CG character that is more real than you could imagine, but not because of the fantastic work by WETA Digital, but because he has personality and depth as a character. He is the most fully realize movie creature since Yoda. Jackson has captured the wear the ring put on him in the 100s of years he possessed it, but more importantly the inner struggle he faces from his old self, Smeagol. It would not have been possible if Andy Serkis had not capture the essence of the character perfectly with not only the voice, but also with the actions that the digital double was created from.
The vast majority of the new areas of Middle Earth we are introduced to revolve around the land of Rohan, where King Theoden resides, but is ever sinking under the arm of the wizard Saruman through his spy, Grima Wormtounge. Theoden's son has died and his heir, nephew Eomer, has been made an outcast while his niece Eowyn tries to save him the best he can. There were characters I really loved in the book and their are just as gripping onscreen. Bernard Hill captures the lost glory of Theoden King who has to convinced Middle Earth is even worth his effort to defend. Miranda Otto perfectly captures the beauty, and most importantly the longing of Eowyn, who is constantly trying to counteract the sliminess of Brad Dourif's spectacular Wormtounge performance.
The story also introduces us to the Ents, Middle Earth's oldest living creatures, when Merry and Pippin run from their captors and into (onto) Treebeard, the eldest of the old. The Ents are the tree-herders in Fangorn Forest from ancient tales long forgotten and even they've nearly forgotten that they themselves are part of Middle Earth and are under threat from their neighbor Saruman. Here is where the film really takes off as the 3 hunters encounter the White Wizard in Fangorn Forest, but it is an old friend returned. He tells them their hobbits are safe and they must come with him and save the king in Rohan before all is lost.
Ian McKellen once again is engrossing as Gandalf in his return, but is different as his color notes. He is more wise, but more wizard like and less human than before. He knows his ultimate task is before him as does Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn whose character forces you to grasp his nobility and as he excepts his destiny. Orlando Bloom is once again back as our favorite bow & knives wielding Elf while his unique friendship with Gilmi  the dwarf continues to grow. Gimli has a series of one liners and wise cracks that truthfully never grow tiring probably because John Rhys Davies is such a lovable character actor. They prove their worth to each other at the battle of Helm's Deep, which can only be summed up as possibly the best onscreen combat I've ever seen. Jackson does wonders capturing both the vast scope of the battle and the human elements making it up.
To say the film is film is visually pleasing is quite the understatement. The artistic details within the film's locations is surely unmatched it today's cinema, if ever. The cinematography is awe-inspiring and sweeps you into the vast lands of Middle Earth. They always seem to have the perfect shot, whether close or sweeping zoom and fade, to convey the feeling they tried to get across to the viewer. The visual effects are more than satisfactory with the Ents joining Gollum as imagination come to life, as well as the 10,000 strong orc army at Helm's Deep.
The best thing Peter Jackson has done in these 2 films is challenge the audience to expect more out of movies and to prove that there is still much that movies can do. He's energized fantasy fans and general moviegoers alike and that in itself is a miracle. The action sequences are huge and the humanity is there to match it, which is probably what makes these films so pleasing in every which way.",1041811200,5,5791,4.611434108527132
1469599,5,B00005JKZU,"There is no question that this is the middle movie of a trilogy. As the opening of this movie does not give a recap of The Fellowship of the Ring , director Peter Jackson expects that you have seen the first movie. The Two Towers will not likely make sense as a movie without FOTR, nor is it meant to. This is also one of the weaknesses of the film. It cannot stand alone. The story is a continuation of the first film and is a transition into the third (and final) film.
With that said, it is a very fine transition. Frodo and Samwise are headed to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are pursuing the captured Meriadoc and Pippin. Gandalf the Grey is missing, having fallen off a bridge in the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring did such a good job introducing the characters and the world they inhabit that no further introduction is needed. That's a good thing, because we don't get an introduction, we are tossed right into the action.
It has been several years since i've last read The Lord of the Rings (with my single volume edition), so i can't comment on changes made to the movie.
All three films of The Lord of the Rings were filmed at the same time, so there is nothing lost in tone or acting or the sets when looking at the three films (or two films, as the third is not yet released). The performances are the same and they continue to ring true for the characters. While the story ultimately centers around Frodo and the Ring, Aragorn is the strongest of all the characters. It is his strength the guides the broken fellowship and it is his strength that is ultimately relied upon. Viggo Mortensen is believable as Aragorn and is actually credible as a warrior. Is Frodo is central to the story, Aragorn is truly the heart of the Fellowship.
There is no true beginning and no true ending to this movie. We know that we are simply passing through to get to the finale in The Return of the King . Even so, this film had to get so many things right to make the series believable and to keep the audience's interest for one more year. There is a computer generated creature named Gollum that we meet in the shadows of the first movie. Gollum is the most important character in the book and in a way, is the most important character in the series. This is for several reasons. He drives the action forward at times, it was Gollum that led the Nazgul to the Shire, Gollum that first discovered the ring, Gollum that helps Frodo to Mordor, Gollum that will lead Frodo and Sam into something new in the next movie. Gollum is tied to the ring and that lends him import. Gollum is also a sad creature that was twisted by the power of the One Ring. He was twisted so much that while he still resembles his old self, it is a warped version of Smeagol. He is so twisted that the creature had to be computer generated. And this is where the movie gets it right. While Jar Jar Binks was a minor, though annoying characters, The Phantom Menace did not depend on Jar Jar. Gollum is of vital importance to The Two Towers and had Peter Jackson and Co. failed to deliver a credible Gollum, the movie may very well have failed. Gollum is a major character with quite a bit of dialogue and interaction with Frodo and Sam. Gollum is nearly perfect and while you realize at times that he isn't real...you quickly forget about that and believe Gollum for what he is.
I must admit that i have been long a fan of the books, so i am already disposed to like the movies. But these are so easy to get wrong. The animated versions from the 70's are horrible. I wanted so much to like these movies and my expectations have been surpassed in both films. The epic battle at Helm's Deep, the Orcs, dwarf (""toss me....but don't tell the elf""), hobbits, and everything else magical about this series is perfectly realized.
This movie is long, around 3 hours. If you dislike fantasy or slightly overlong epics....skip this. If you haven't seen the first movie...rent it. If you like it, go see this. I believe that you will be missing out on a good movie if you do not see this, but everyone has different tastes and this is not one i will put on the list of movies to push to everyone (Memento, Almost Famous). Suspend your disbelief and sit back to enjoy a well told epic story.",1041811200,2,4290,4.350374064837905

I have spent way to much money on the movie as well as books. I was dissappointed at a few things that were left out after reading the books. But overall I loved the movies. I can not wait untill Dec when Return of the King comes out. Jackson did an amazing job with the effects. The cast is excellent I don't know who could play the carachters any better than who they chose. I also cannot wait until the Two Towers comes out on DVD.

1469715,5,B00005JKZU,"When I heard that this was going to be more emotional and have more themes of family and friends than Fellowship, I seriously doubted anything could top the scenes in Hobbiton. I was drastically wrong. For a good portion of the movie, I was in tears. Several times, I forgot that Treebeard and Gollum were animatronics and CG and thought they were real. The Battle at Helm's Deep had me at the edge of my seat and I tried not to cheer TOO loudly when help arrived (both times). Osgiliath was amazing and they did an excellent job showing how much the ring was effecting Frodo. I loved the scene with the Easterlings and Southrons (Oliphaunt people. I got that wrong, didn't I?). Miranda Otto was beautiful portraying Eowyn and brought her character to life. All the scenes in Edoras (make that Rohan) were captivating and I was upset that Eomer didn't have a larger role. The scene with the wargs was FANTASTIC! Showing Eowyn's concern for Aragorn and the wolves themselves were great. The opening had my jaw to the floor and the ending was PER-FECT! Some people are upset that Peter Jackson moved her to ROTK, but Sam and Frodo don't have a lot to do in ROTK, it was a better cliffhanger, more people will read the books this way, and the movie should have ended on a happy note anyway.
Some of the moments irked me, though. I was annoyed that Arwen had to show up, but she did sway my pity to her during one bit. Gimli was funny, but the comedy was overdone a bit. Like I said above, Eomer should have had a larger role. Faramir shouldn't have been evil (made sense in a way what they did), and I am FURIOUS over what they did to Haldir (I'm still crying about it). Mostly it was a bad thing to do because those who didn't remember him from Fellowship or hadn't even seen it, didn't get to know him that well, and this is Haldir. You just don't do that. Merry and Pippin didn't get enough time, nor did Saruman.
However, when you watch the movie, you'll forget everything I mentioned that was wrong (except Haldir, IMHTVO). This is a movie that will grab you, hold you, and won't let you go until it's over. Trust me, you'll forget about the time as you watch it. Once you see the Black Gates, the wargs, and the army at Isengard, you're theirs. Trust me. Go see it. I can't give it enough praise.",1041724800,,2299,4.361305361305361
1469716,5,B00005JKZU,"I absolutely loved this movie!  Sure, when I saw it at midnight, my brain was half dead, but then I saw it a couple more times when I was fully awake and it was great.  Attention Tolkien purists: You will not like this movie if you can't stand any changes made from the book.
If you're not a big Tolkien BOOK fan and you just want to see a good movie, here are some basic guidelines to whether you'd like it or not:
If you really don't like violence, don't see this film.  None of the violence is graphic, but it's rated PG-13 for ""Epic battle sequences and scary images"".  If you liked Fellowship of the Ring for the beautiful Shire and Rivendell and cute hobbit-children, you'll be surprised at how much darker The Two Towers (TTT) is.
If you're a parent and you have kids under 13 who are absolutely begging to see this movie, screen it first.  Especially if your kids are sensitive to creepy ghosts and people getting killed and disgusting monsters called orcs, this is not a good film for them to see.  I've heard that most parents see the PG part of the PG-13 rating and not the 13.
If you like comedies and not dramatic epics, this is not a good movie for you.
If you LOVE fantasy action/adventures, you'll love this movie.
If you can't stand creatures that don't exist in real life, this is not a film you'd like.
If you're a person in the category that I call Tolkien purist, where you can't stand anyone changing Tolkien's glorious epic, then you'll be horrified at some of the changes.  I'm a super-ringer (Tolkien FAN, not purist), and I was a little miffed with Faramir's changes, but it's still a great movie.
If you loved FOTR (Fellowship of the Ring), love the books, but don't mind changes made, GO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!!
And also if you've read The Silmarillion, you'll adore some references to the Undying Lands, Valinor, the Valar, and the elves passing over the sea.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen FOTR.  That would just be crazy, because you wouldn't understand a thing.
If you're a little out of the Tolkien loop, and you're wondering what happens in this movie, a bare bones summary is ""The quest continues to destroy a ring with the power to enslave the world"".  A little more thorough description is that Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin.  Frodo and Sam continue towards Mordor, and are joined by Gollum.  A, L, and G meet up with the people of Rohan and join them in fighting a huge battle at a place called Helm's Deep.  The rest I won't spoil.
Please go see this movie!  It's a breath of fresh air after some of the junk that Hollywood comes out with....",1041724800,4,2655,4.449484536082474

As for ""Two Towers"" I won't add too much but this: the epic with Celtic music by Howard Shore in the background, simply stupendous, magnificent, grandieuse. As for Computer Animation, praise for the work behind Gollum: seamless, melds in with the Hobbits in a way that more than makes believe. Finally, the battle for Helm's Deep is simply breathtaking.

In many ways, THE TWO TOWERS is a better film than FELLOWSHIP. The action is bigger, the cast is larger, the battles are more magnificient. The central cast of the film is split over three different parts of Middle Earth  and the magnitude of the undertaking filming of Tolkien's beloved masterpiece can truly be recognized in this film.
However, many will be upset over the many changes that have been made in the story. It must be granted that there are many more changes in TWO TOWERS than there were in FELLOWSHIP. Nevertheless, many of the changes bring the text more to life, while others speed up the plot and make the film more interesting (a movie and a novel are not the same thing!) which is something of a necessity in a three-hour film.
I won't say much about the plot of the film other than to comment that the movie ends on even more of a cliff hanger than FELLOWSHIP. Whereas, the FELLOWSHIP movie ended at the beginning of THE TWO TOWERS book, THE TWO TOWERS movie ends far short of where the book ends.
Great, rousing cinema with something for everyone. A wonderful way to spend an afternoon or evening.",1041638400,2,1440,4.55984555984556
1469719,3,B00005JKZU,"The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the best films of 2001 (maybe the best) and one of the most engaging adventures I've ever seen (lagging behind only the Indiana Jones series in this respect).  It's unfortunate The Two Towers fails to follow in the suspense, thrills, and emotional sweep of the first installment.  Overall, it's a decent movie (thanks mostly to its ties with the first film) but this is definitely a terribly disappointing continuation.
As I stated before in my review for Fellowship, I have never read the classic Tolkein novel, thus my complaints have nothing to do with comparative discrepancies.  What I see wrong here is my belief of what are some poor filmmaking decisions.  Much of the appeal of Fellowship was that it was about a small group of a quest that ventured into the unknown, an odyssey full of suspense, thrills and chills.  A surprise lay at every corner, whether it was a riddle, monster, or barrier hindering the journey.  Virtually all of this is lacking from The Two Towers.  It's simply a ""gather as many people together and deliver a big battle"" affair that fails to hold interest.  Some of the slower moments are harder to slog through than my typical day of chemistry class.
As just an average moviegoer, what else did I find wrong with the film?  First, characters pop up on an infrequent basis and then disappear almost as quickly.  Sure, the lead cast is still interesting (particularly Legolas and Aragorn) and the additions of Gollum and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) aid the film during its slower moments.  But most everyone else is a nobody to me, their names uttered too quickly for me to remember and killed off too quickly for me to even bother caring (the king's son, who was he and why did the director think we'd care about his death, given we never even saw him alive in the first place?).
Director Peter Jackson films at least two dozen scenes in slow motion, obviously meant to be dramatic, but most of these moments once again involve characters we don't even know (particularly the slow-mo death of one elf during the battle of Helm's Deep).  Such scenes weigh the film down and give it an agonizingly slow pace.  As for the battle of Helm's Deep, that was perhaps the biggest disappointment of all.  Waiting nearly two-and-a-half hours for the climactic battle, it's unfortunate to see Jackson mars this lengthy sequence with quick-cut editing that turns the sword clashes into a blur.  Intercutting the battle with two other subplots only destroys whatever momentum the spectacle had been building up.
Yet, with all my complaining, there is still much I admired.  The performances are still first-rate, the special effects are mostly excellent, and Howard Shore's score is the most rousing since Vangelis' Conquest of Paradise piece.  The Two Towers lacks in action/adventure and rarely engaged on an emotional level, but it's a movie that's nice to look at, often fairly easy to appreciate, and there's enough breathtaking cinematography to keep things afloat for awhile.  But it's three hours long, hardly energetic enough, and an anti-climax when it should be revving up on the suspense.  I sincerely hope The Return of the King atones for The Two Towers, but I have my doubts.",1041638400,2,3240,4.836956521739131
1469720,5,B00005JKZU,"Having seen The Two Towers three times it has become one of my all time favorite movies.  It is up there with the Star Wars trilogy.  See this film on the big screen while you can.  I've never read the books, but usually the movie version of a book takes many liberties as does this one.  Don't compare it to the book, but see it for the action and adventure.  This movie is destined to be one of the all-time great classic fantasy films.  The visuals are stunning, but don't smother the story as do more recent special effect movies.  I can't wait to see the next Lord of the Rings movie.  Why can't more movies be made like this one?",1041638400,2,635,4.190082644628099
1469721,2,B00005JKZU,"I loved the first movie, adored the extended version, and waited eagerly for the second installment. However, my partner and I left the theatre feeling betrayed.
The Two Towers is not the film that I expected to see. It's obvious why changes were made to the story, but *So Many* changes were made that the story seemed warped. My main issues were with the following things (spoilers minimised):
* the Ents are ""tree-herders."" They care for the trees, and are, effectively, the Forest. They Know what happens in the forest.
* For Aragorn to be injured once is a misfortune. For him to be injured so many times seems daft, and takes away the tension. (Esp. when *every* incident was added to the story.)
* Bits were added for light relief that go against the basic personality of characters, as seen in the books. An army is added for coolness only.
* Faramir is a noble guy. While adding tension heightens the drama, it really goes too far. Much, much, too far.
(Some of the other changes also annoyed me, but not as much.)
Admittedly, I'm hypersensitive about this because I loved the original story so much. I didn't expect a direct transfer, but I certainly didn't assume that it would be a complete rewrite either. I'm sure I'm in the minority, but all of my friends who have seen it so far have been at least annoyed by some of the changes.",1041638400,14,1345,4.539094650205762
1469722,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers hands down wins my vote for best action film of 2002.  Fans of the first movie on a whole should love the second film as well as the action TOTALLY picks up.  Fans of the books may not be as thrilled with the greater emphasis on action over story.  On a whole though, MOST should be pleased with Peter Jacksons second look at Tolkiens legendary work.
THE STORY:
Sarumon the White and Sauron, lords of the Two Towers (Isengard and Mordor), have joined forces to wipe out the denizens of Middle-Earth.  The Fellowship of the Ring has split into three where our story picks up following the storylines of Frodo and Sam who continue to journey to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring; Merry and Pippin who were captured; and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf who seek to rally the people of Middle Earth to rise up and take on the combined Dark Forces.
THE ANALYSIS:
Overall, if you love action and FX, this movie BRINGS it in spades.  This nearly three hour film is almost exclusively fight scenes and suspense.  Tolkiens story is still in the background, but the film tones it down in favor of the fights scenes which is cool with me but may not leave Tolkien purists overly happy.
The character of Gollum easily steals the show with his schizophrenic episodes.  The character of Gimli the Dwarf is also played well as comical relief throughout.
BEST SCENES:
- The battle of Helms Deep (easily tops Attack of the Clones final battle scene)
- Gollums schizophrenia
- The Trees at Isengard
- Gandalf saves Theoden
THE VERDICT:
Overall, the intense action and the awesome special effects rendering of Tolkiens world will easily put LOR: The Two Towers at the top of anyones favorite movie list.
You know you don't want to miss this.

1469723,5,B00005JKZU,"Don't get me wrong, I love Lord of the Rings in book form.  My three favorite books of all time are the three that tell of Frodo's quest to destroy the ring.  With such a love of the books, it would be easy to pass this movie off as [junk] because it changed way too much.  And yes, if it were truer to Tolkien I would probably have liked it even better!  But here's how I think of it: Tolkien said that he wasn't so much writing a story as he was discovering and retelling it.  He went so far as to think of LotR and his other writings on Arda (the LotR world - Middle Earth is only part of it!) as a mythology that England could call its own.  So the books are Tolkien's version of the story.  But like any great mythology, details change in every telling, and now Jackson is telling a slightly different yet equally enthralling version of the story.  The details may be different, but the big plot points are there, and when it all comes down to it the story is as grand and epic as ever.",1041638400,4,991,4.072164948453608
1469864,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers, the second in the famous trilogy, is at least as good as the first. Yes it's true, the plot is much darker than in The Fellowship of Ring but that's how it is in the book as well. Although the plot isn't as lighthearted as the first movie, the more serious nature comes across well and there are plenty of amusing moments that help to lighten the mood.
  The movie starts off right where the Fellowship ended(it might be a good idea to watch the Fellowship before watching the Two Towers for the first time). The first scene is of Gandalf fighting the Balrog. The difference is, this time when he falls, we follow him. We end up watching a dramatic battle as both the Balrog and Gandalf fall into a vast cavern. Then we join Frodo and Sam. Frodo wakes up, and we end up thinking the battle was just a dream. We then meet up with Merry and Pippin in the hands of the Uruk Hai. Then we move on to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they give chase to the Uruk Hai in hopes of rescuing Merry and Pippin. We are then in for a long ride of a fight to conquer evil, friendship, loss, delightful humor, and, of course, action packed fun.
  The movie is extraordinarily well done and will undoubtedly be even more loved than the first. The only criticism for it that I can find is that since the beginning introduces so many characters, it's a bit hard to follow. I also think that the love story between Aragorn and Arwen was a bit overdone. The Ent's appearances weren't what I'd pictured but they were very well done. Everything else is done to perfection. The Battle of Helms Deep is amazing, the numerous special effects are just as good, or better, than anticipated, and Gollum is absolutely perfect! Everything(acting, script, layout, special effects, etc.), was done to perfection. The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever! A must see for everyone. A+

1469865,5,B00005JKZU,"I have now sat through ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" several times, including a few viewings of the film's extended edition, which was released on DVD earlier this Winter. When I originally saw the film theatrically, I liked it, but didn't love it and found it rather flawed - the first hour seemed too slow and I never really found myself fully involved in the characters. However, I warmed up to the film after its first DVD release and consider the extended version to be a very considerable improvement over the theatrical cut.
I'm pleased to say that I found ""The Two Towers"", the follow-up to the first picture, to be mostly a phenomenal piece of cinema (once again, I have not read the books - I'm going simply on what I thought of the film). The film may be the middle part of the trilogy, but that actually works for the opening of the picture - we know these characters and after the sudden close of the first film, most will likely be eager to see the adventure continue on-screen. The opening sixty minutes of the picture opens at a full-throttle pace as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) continue to try and rescue hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from their Orc captors. Elsewhere, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to destroy the ring, guided by Gollum (Andy Serkis), a CGI-creature who is obsessed with the ring, but decides to serve as the guide for the two hobbits. There is also the return of Gandalf (Ian McKellen).
The film does split the story into a few pieces, although it's a credit to director Peter Jackson and the film's editors that the film cuts between the stories perfectly, with not too much time spent on one or another. This film focuses on Aragorn's character considerably more than anyone else, but that's not a bad thing: Viggo Mortensen is a terrific actor and the progression of this character is the most engaging part of this picture. Still, Frodo's quest is compelling material and even Merry and Pippin's ending up on the shoulders of a giant tree creature, Tree Beard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies) is enjoyable - a good mix of comedy and drama. While Gollum's tragic battle with his own soul is often very well-played, there is one darkly funny sequence with the creature battling himself that is quite amusing. The human actors also all provide uniformly stellar performances, with even some of the performances that have less screen-time (Liv Tyler's Arwen) remaining memorable.
All of this eventually builds towards the battle of Helm's Deep, a giant stone fortress that Aragorn, Pippin, Gimli, king Theoden (Bernard Hill) and an army of a few hundred men have retreated to. Sauruman (Christopher Lee)'s armies are sweeping across the lands, however, and its only a matter of time before they reach the gates. When they do - the film's last 20-25 minutes - it's something truly breathtaking. Facing impossible odds, the band of a few hundred looks out to face nearly 10,000.
The film does have a bit of a slow point around the middle, but both the opening and closing of the film proceed with more forward momentum than the first picture did in general. ""The Two Towers"" story, split into several sections, also feels larger than the first film - there's more going on, there feels like even more at stake and the urgency and emotion that Jackson is able to give many events in the film is remarkable.
Technically, the film is also remarkable. Peter Jackson and team, whose careful use of CGI mixed with astonishingly beautiful real locations only enhances the film, shows how computer effects should be used, unlike the latest ""Star Wars"" pictures, where the effects overwhelm everything else. Gollum, for example, is a far better character - in animation, voicing, writing, emotion and movement - than Lucas's horrid Jar-Jar Binks. Andrew Lesnie's cinematography once again makes the New Zeland locations look breathtakingly beautiful and epic. Howard Shore's score adds drama, tension and excitement without calling too much attention to itself. Production design is, once again, first-rate.
""The Two Towers"" is not a flawless picture, but it is grand, epic filmmaking unlike anything I've seen in recent years. The continuing story of these great characters continues to be compelling, the realization of this world by Peter Jackson and crew is visually stunning and many scenes here are powerful and incredibly memorable - especially the Helm's Deep sequence, which is more amazing than anything I've seen on the big screen in recent memory.

1469866,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy masterpiece, the Lord of the Rings.
The Fellowship of the Ring has just been broken and our heroes are now all heading in different directions, all following their own paths. Merry and Pippin have just been captured by a horde of Saruman's foul Huruk-Ha who, following the sorcerer's orders, are taking them to his tower of Isengard, and Aragorn the Heir of Gondor, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf are running to their rescue across the plains of Rohan, land of the Rohirim horsemasters. Taking the advantage of a clash between the orcs and a band of Rohirim, the hobbits manage to escape into Fangorn, the old forest, home of the legendary Ents. There they'll meet an old acquaintance.
Meanwhile Frodo, the Ring-bearer, and his friend Sam are on their way to Mordor. It won't be long until they become lost, nor before they realize they're not alone. Gollum, the filthy creature who once possessed the One Ring, has been following them all along. They capture him, but soon Frodon takes pity and decides to release him in exchange for Gollum's word that he'll guide them to Mordor.
Once again, Peter Jackson managed to bring to screen the enchanting spirit of JJR Tolkien's complex novels. I personally liked Gollum's character a lot, as well as admired the creature's beautiful computer graphics animation. And the Battle of Helm's Deep, the terrible final conflagration between Thoden's people and Saruman's army of ten thousand orcs, is just as formidable.

Director Peter Jackson took Tolkiens already exciting story and made it into the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was exciting and intriguing, leaving me counting the days till The Return of The King comes out.
Several people I saw the movie with complained that the details were confusing, but it's actually alot simpler than it seems. Good vs. Evil is the basic rule. Others complained about details left out from the book, and other details that were added. It seemed to me that the director did the best he could to stay with the book in the 3 hours he was given (you could take a week for each movie) and the few things he changed only made the plot more understandable.
I can't think of anything to complain about, besides afew moments of talking trees (which I found kinda boring) and a cheesy love story. Overall the movie was great, and I would see it for the special effects alone. I recomend it to anyone.",1041552000,,961,4.465909090909091

""The Two Towers"" not only lives up to the grandeur and unmatched spectacle of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" it surpasses it with a greater focus on character and a subdued (but still prominent) focus on exposition.  It is also obvious now, when all is said and done, that Peter Jackson's trilogy will be considered the greatest achievement in the history of cinematic fantasy.  Critics that bash it now as too long or for fantasy geeks only will have to eat crow when these movies are still beloved decades from now.
How did Jackson do it?  How did he make a film like ""The Two Towers,"" one that cost over $100 million to make and yet still feels entirely handmade?  How did he keep a story compelling that should have run out of gas long ago?  However he did it (one assumes it involved lots of late hours and an inordinate amount of help), you the viewer get the end product, and what a sight it is to see.  ""Two Towers"" avoids the plodding narrative of ""Fellowship"" by breaking up its main characters into groups.  With three main storylines going on at once, Jackson alternates between subplots so that the story never grows too stale.  It also has a stronger grip on characters, showing them in moments other than fighting or running away, and that actually helps the film breeze by (3 hours have never passed so quickly, unless you slept through Dances with Wolves).
And you never feel like you see the same thing twice during ""Towers.""  There are always new things to see, new places to go, or new homages to be alert for (in particular one to ""The Wizard of Oz"" at the gates of Mordor).  Of special note is Gollum, the CGI creature who never feels forced into the picture.  He's a real character, and at no point does he just feel like a cartoon stuck in a live action flick.
Are there problems with ""Towers""?  Sure.  The bad guys have terrible aim and the good guys, natch, do not.  There's so much latent homoerotism between Frodo and Sam you half expect them to start kissing halfway in.  And Jon Rhys-Davies jokes are a little corny, but welcome relief in a movie this intense.  There's also not enough of the prominent villains (Christopher Lee's Saruman or the evil Sauron).  Still, movies don't get much better than this, and ""Towers"" seems to only justify Peter Jackson's growing legacy.  A triumph.",1041552000,4,2544,4.5394736842105265

If any of those people try to tell me that with The Two Towers I'm afraid I will have to think that they are liars or idiots.  Very little of the book is left.  I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the creator's were attempting to say.  There must be some sort of statement they want to proclaim that they are using Tolkien's work for, or should I say, abusing.  Why didn't they just make up their own story, I wonder.  Oh, yeah, they are making millions by distorting these works.
My main issue lies with the destruction of characters.  I understand perfectly that you can't fit these books all into 9 hrs of film.  But that doesn't mean you have to destroy the wonderful characters that Tolkien created. ...**

1469871,4,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is an excellent sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring. The strengths of the movie lie in the special effects, the acting, and the battle scenes.
For those who have not read the book, it would be difficult to identify the territories and the characters upon first viewing of this movie, even if you happened to see The Fellowship of the Ring. Upon second viewing, one will likely get a much better ability to perceive the significance of each territory of Middle Earth.
There are those who criticize the movie for its tendencies to stray from the original storyline, and they may have their case. I say that perhaps the main weakness that both purists and nonpurists could bring about would be that the sequel has a weaker focus on the main plot, which is to take the ring to the fires of Mordor and destroy it.
However, there was not really that much that could be done to prevent this from really happening, for from the conclusion of The Fellowship to that of the Two Towers, the team was split up, leaving the factions fending for themselves in the various regions of Middle Earth.
If you have not seen it, here is a recommendation. Though the all-consuming goal and the final product, essentially, is to get to Mordor, think primarily of the intermediate territories in the process. In other words, spend your time comparing and contrasting the scenes from Rohan, Helms Deep, Isengard and Minas Tirith; for Mordor is still ahead.",1041465600,,1447,4.67843137254902

For everyone familiar with THE LORD OF THE RINGS stories, I promise you will not be disappointed.  The entire fellowship are here and looking great! Gandalf is mysterious, and powerful, but his warmth and concern for his comrades shines through.  Aragorn is handsome and has a quiet appeal that can only be called a ""presence"" about him.  Gimli is kind of a lovable bully. Legolas is sprightly and intelligent. Frodo is the gentle hobbit that has to carry and bear the weight of evil. Sam, Merry and Pippin are just what I expected and Gollum could not have been better. The Orcs are a horrible and ugly group and worse looking than I ever pictured them.

1470015,5,B00005JKZU,"When Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring came out in 2001, it easily took the title of Greatest Fantasy Film Of All Time (with the possible exception of John Boorman's Excalibur - but that's a subject for another review). That all changed last month when The Two Towers, FOTR's sequel, premiered.
Yes, folks, Peter Jackson has pulled off the nifty trick of making a film even more jaw-droppingly beautiful than his FOTR. In a world where most sequels are nothing more than blatant cash-ins, Jackson has made one that manages to be simultaneously more spectacular and complex than the original.
Of course, it never hurts to have good source material. The trick is pulling off J.R.R. Tolkien's singular mix of the epic and the personal. LOTR, like many great stories before and after it, is primarily a story about little people (literally, in this case) caught up in big events. If one doesn't hit just the right balance between the two, the whole thing falls apart. Jackson, thank goodness, does just that.
Friends - I could go on and on about this film: the amazing special effects, the breathtaking battle sequences - heck, I could do an entire review about Jackson's uncanny gift for composition. I could also talk about all the nonsense I've read in ostensibly ""intellectual"" magazines about how all this fantasy stuff is irrelevant - merely an escape from the harsh realities of our world. All I know is that LOTR - book and films - are about the importance of courage and friendship in an increasingly horrifying world. Now I ask you - what could possibly be more relevant than that?",1041465600,2,1599,4.755395683453237
1470016,4,B00005JKZU,"I saw ""The Two Towers"" about two weeks ago and I have to say, I was not disappointed.  Never forget the incredible Battle of Helm's Deep, or the amazingly realistic Ents, or Samwise the Brave (long live Sam!).  My only problem was that they stopped the movie before Sam and Frodo meet Shelob; I was all ready to cry my eyes out!  Ah well, just a minor flaw in an otherwise awesome movie.  ""The Two Towers"" drew me right back into the story from the start, casting its magic spell with the first haunting notes of music.  From the first I was on the edge of my seat, wondering anxiously what would become of the Fellowship.  I was amazed by Gollum, how real and creepy -- and pitifully funny at times --  he was.  One minute he would be Stinker, with no thought other than killing Frodo to regain the Ring, and the next he would be Slinker, pathetically eager to please.  The debate between the two halves of Gollum's personality is guaranteed to send chills down your spine!
And now, to several hilights of the movie:  Treebeard the Ent caring for Merry and Pippin after their escape from the Orcs (yay for Pippin, who proves that he is no ""fool of a Took""); the incredible Entish destruction of Isengard; Gimli's hilarious comments, which never failed to make me laugh; Aragorn's inspiring leadership; and of course, the deep friendship between Sam and Frodo, even when Frodo is under the Ringspell.  And kudos to Peter Jackson for an incredibly dramatic ending, with a twist that nobody (least of all me) could have anticipated.  Yes, it is much different than the book, but it's excellent nonetheless.  I won't reveal the details at risk of spoiling it, but let's just say that I was about to have a heart attack because of it!  Frodo never spoke truer words than these:  ""[. . .]And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.""  See this movie; you won't be disappointed!  Bring on next December, and be prepared to bawl when you see the conclusion of this awesome adventure in ""Return of the King!""

1470017,3,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is a good film with excellent scenery, actors, music, and special effects.  However, I was disapointed with the interesting choices Peter Jackson made regarding what parts of the book to include.  The director apparently decided to cut out chunks of the book to make room for completely made-up scenes.  In one instance, a character's attitude and actions were completely reversed (!!!).  And for the parts that were originally from the book, many were altered.
So if you plan on seeing this and have never read the books and don't plan on ever reading them, it's a great movie.  But if you love Tolkien's work, the two towers is still good, just be prepared for the numerous changes.",1041379200,5,699,4.791666666666667
1470018,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie is awsome!  I have seen it 3 times and I would like to see it a fourth!  This movie passes the first installment by far!  It is 3 hours and 15 minutes long but it is worth the time.  It is very different from the book and there is less Merry and Pippin and also less of Frodo and Sam than in the Fellowship of the Ring.  Some parts were a little two long for me (like Sam talking forever to Frodo about not giving up or something!) but all the other great parts made up for it!  The best part was that Orlando Bloom (Legolas) actually had some LINES in this movie!!!!!  I totally love Orlando! If you see the movie, there is also a trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean, a new movie starring Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, and ORLANDO BLOOM! But anyway, I suggest this movie to anyone who luvs LOTR.  Peter Jackson is truly a genious! The movie may be hard to follow to thoughs who have not read the book series, as with the first one.  In this movie, it is slightly confusing because it is night one minute and the previous day or following day the next minute.  It goes forward and back in time a lot to track the tree 'parties' the fellowship has divided into. Despite the confusion, the script, and camara work, and especially the special effects excelled beyond my expectations! The battle of Helms Deep was spectacular!  There were also a few witty lines in the movie and the score was the best I have heard in a long time!  My favorite music was the violin music they play in Edoras. The actors have talent beyond belief!  You can hardly tell that they aren't aragorn or gimli or frodo or something!  How come you can understand Viggo Mortenson in the movie but I need subtitles to understand his interviews?  Strange...",1041379200,3,1734,4.341614906832298
1470019,4,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is a fitting follow up to the very successful first instalment. Again there are strong performances by almost all the cast, the cinematography, attention to detail and pace are excellent, and the creative adaptation of certain elements from the books are by in large successful. However, having now seen the extended version of the ""Fellowship"", I have to wonder what was left on the cutting room floor, and what might be included in a subsequent DVD release.
I'm not wanting to sound too rabid a fan, but I was disappointed with a few elements in the film. While the ""Fellowship"" perfectly captured the relationship between Sam and Frodo, the Two Towers seemed to lack the development of the relationship between Legolas and Gimli. This is primarily due to the direction of Gimli's character, which tended towards bombast and general comic relief. This direction, while making internal sense within the movie, misses the crux of Gimli's character in the book, and doesn't leave enough with the audience to explain the depth and intensity of the friendship between these two characters. The extended ""Fellowship"" DVD made some critical development of the Gimli character, though given the structure of the cinematic release of the ""Two Towers"" I am not sure how easy it may be to do the same. In addition, I am again not too sure of Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Elrond. I'm not entirely certain whether it is his presence or direction, but I can't escape the feeling that Rupert Everett might have been a better choice for the role. I am looking forward to an extended version coming out in a year - the pieces added to the Fellowship DVD filled many of the minor imperfections of the theatrical release, and hopefully the same will be said with the Two Towers.
That being said, all other aspects of the film were excellent. Viggo Mortensen captures his role perfectly, the opening sequence is brilliant, and Gollum is the first CGI character I have not found to be both instantly obnoxious and a waste of space. Like its predecessor, this is not a movie for those with an MTV attention span or a pride in their own functional illiteracy. For the rest of us, Two Towers is definitely worth seeing - it is engaging, visually spectacular and well acted: what more could you wish for in a movie?",1041379200,3,2306,4.7819548872180455
1470020,1,B00005JKZU,"As a ""Lord of the rings"" novel fan, Fellowship became one of my favourite movies ever because of its similarity with the book (I understand the few things changed to bring the novel to theatres).
But this one, aughh, is too different from the novel, and the worst of the cases, in detriment of the history and the characters:
- Frodo NEVER goes to Osgiliath, or faces the Nazgl
- Faramir is wise and gives his best wishes to Frodo's mission, he is not a bad guy, he doesn't take Frodo as prisoner, or treat him bad at all.
- Frodo NEVER attacked Sam with a knife.
- Sam never runs to Morannon (the gate) or gets caught in quicksand or whatever, or somebody spot them.
- &Eacute;omer has been held in prison for disagreements with Grima, he is not an exiled, and who comes to Helm's deep at the end of the battle is Erkenbrand, and also, some kind of Ents are the ones make and ambush to the orcs when they are in full retreat.
- Aragorn (and friends) never fight against the wolves or fall to a river or has been rescued by a horse or returns when every one thinks he is death. He is always at the side of Th&eacute;oden
- Th&eacute;oden is not under Saruman's spell, but under Grima's gossip
- The ents already know that the forest has been destroyed and decided BY THEMSELVES to attack Isengard. It is not because some hobbit tells them to do it.
...and so on, I can be writing for hours and hours...What can I expect for the ""Return of the King"", Gollum king of Gondor? Frodo taking Sauron's place instead of throwing the ring into Mount Doom? Arwen marrying Gandalf? Or what???",1041379200,34,1581,4.344594594594595

""We must go to argon and get the splinter t cheese crisp to find the missing amulet of my brother."" Scene changes to 2 kids and a really annoying moster thing which lead no where the just walk around and argue and a bunch of other .... happens that has no point and is really boring.

Okay. The first one did, too. I really enjoyed the parts when I wasn't dozing off. Gollum is absolutely engaging and wonderfully realized. He was my favorite character in the movie--indeed, in both episodes combined.  It was a mistake for Gimli to be the comic relief. Rhys-Davies just isn't up to it. In that regard, we have what I think is the only serious flaw in Part II--the lack of a sufficiently ""light"" character to add depth and pleasure to the film.
Then again--yawn--why did I find myself nodding off at various points? Could it be that this movie is too long? Heaven forbid! Could it be that the battle scene was stretched out to the point of being, well, exhausting and a bit over-cooked? Not possible! Might it be that the ""American Express"" commercial look and feel (reminiscent of moments from the hideous ""Gladiator"") to the flashbacks triggered a nascent narcolepsy? How could that be?!
Let's call this film for what it is. A fine movie, but certainly not an example of any sort of economy--of time, of plot, of action, or of scenery. But, given the need to convert Tolkein's legendary books to the screen, the central flaw in them has joined us for the ride. The Lord of the Rings books, for all their wonder, are, well, a bit on the boring side for long stretches. You'd have to be a Middle Earth glutton to think otherwise.
One thing this movie, and the first, did well is to show that the ring is technology and mastery over the world, and that our lust for it--so appropos in today's day and age--is going to lead to our destruction. Few, ironically, seem to get it. Fewer still understand that Tokien, a luddite of the first order, was condemning the engine of modern Europe and, more pointedly, America, where in a few short years we've acquired more Gollums (can you say, ""Bill Gates,"" but certainly the rest of us, too) than one might have ever imagined. Here's to empty-hearted, lustful, compelling, dehumanizing, and meaningless attraction to progress, science, and money!

Faramir is portrayed differently in the book, and I like that way much more, as he is concerned that Gollum is to lead the hobbits past Minas Morgul, where the Nazgul reside.  Although there are flaws, I'd like to see anyone do a better job at making this movie than Peter Jackson has.  And then, you can go and try to make a better version of Dead Alive if you'd like.

1470175,5,B00005JKZU,"Been there, done that.
When I first saw THE TWO TOWERS, I (a hopeless Tolkienite) was in shock.  What did I just see?  Eomer not at Helm's Deep, but instead riding to the rescue with Gandalf?  The reluctance of King Theoden to go to war against Isengard?  Helm's Deep as a refuge for the people of Edoras, instead of a heavily-fortified Rohan stronghold?  Aragorn going over a cliff with a warg?  Eowyn a romantic counterpart to Aragorn?  Arwen, Elrond, and Galadriel in the movie at all?  A host of elves from Lothlorien, led by Haldir, coming to the rescue of Helm's Deep?  No ""moving forest"" to destroy and smother fleeing orcs from the Helm's Deep battle?  The reluctance of Treebeard and the Ents to go to war?  Faramir, brother of Boromir, taking Frodo and Sam captive to use the Ring?  The men of Gondor taking the Hobbits to Osgiliath (in the book, nothing more than a ghost town), under siege by Sauron?  No showdown between Gandalf and Saruman?  No disgusting, foul-smelling tunnel of Shelob?
Yes, I was in shock.  How dare Peter Jackson take such liberties with this, perhaps the best, of the books in the LOTR trilogy?
Fortunately, I took a deep breath, then went to see this film again.  A good friend of mine reminded me that books and movies are two entirely different mediums:  what works well for one doesn't necessarily translate for the other.  And I must confess, despite all my misgivings:  this film is a complete cinematic masterpiece.  THE TWO TOWERS is a virtual feast for the eyes--breathtaking landscapes, stunning cinematography, mind-boggling CGI (Gollum/Smeagol comes across as an actual, living creature), compelling acting, and a great, great story.  It's a story that gets up and moves, from the first frame to the last; it's a story that makes its own mark, independent of the book it was based upon.
I realize the Tolkien purists are up in arms:  so was I, at first.  My suggestion:  see this film with an open mind, and let it entertain you on its own merits.  You will not be disappointed.",1041292800,9,2026,4.703703703703703

Installment two opts for LONGER battle scenes (surprisingly bloodless) and almost an equal distribution of on-screen time for each of the major players in this epic tale.
However, the combination of computer generated effects and the acting skills of Andy Serkis make ""Gollum"" one of the true marvels of a truly stupendous film.  The actor's vocal talents and inspired movements make this one of the most memorable ""debuts"" in motion picture history.
And John Ryes-Davis does double duty in the returning role of Gimli the dwarf AND the voice of ""Treebeard"", a creature that bears a striking resemblance to late director John Huston.",1041292800,2,769,5.193548387096774
1470177,2,B00005JKZU,"I have read these books many times.  I learned of them many years ago because I was doing research on a certain author; the research lead me to C. S. Lewis and so on to Tolkien. I truly wished I could inhabit this wonderful place that Tolkien ""discovered."" I was/am like Sam: I would dearly love to meet the Elves.  They were Tolkien's favorites, and the details that he created for them reveals that.
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" would rate 5 stars from me; I, too, noticed omissions of incidents, and I wondered how certain situations would be resolved because of those omissions/changes.
I bought my ticket ASAP and went to ""The Two Towers"" on the first day at the first showing and left feeling ""leaden.""  Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli are still acted very well.  Sean Astin is a wonderful Sam; in fact, I think Sam is the ultimate hero of the LOTR.  All the hobbit actors are very good, but I do not think Merry and Pippin will be given the chance to be the heroes they were in the books.  Why did Faramir take Frodo, Sam, and Gollum?  He would have been more noble than his brother Boromir if he had let Frodo and all depart to continue on their way to Mordor.  Elves at Helm's Deep?  Where were the trees who destroyed their enemies on the plains before Helm's Deep?  How will Eowyn prove her courage as a shield maiden of Rohan?  And most awful of all:  Frodo confronting a mounted Ringwraith.
The battle scenes at Helm's Deep are full of action which will please many viewers.  And Legolas at his crucial moment?  It's inconsistent.
My son and I agree in our disappointment.  If someone asks about the movie, I say ""sure, go see it,"" but I can't rave about it.  Each person must decide for him/herself.

1470178,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson and his associates continue the Lord of the Rings saga with intelligence, inspiration and brilliance.  They have created another wonderfully realized film with a seamless blend of location filming, elaborate sets, makeup & costumes, and CGI magic.  The film hits-the-deck-running, picking up where the first film stopped, with hardly a breath of backstory.  It is beautifully filmed with gorgeous cinematography and continued imagination & thought.
We can again be thankful for the boldness & courage of Jackson and his financial backers to film the entire trilogy at once and the same time.  The dividends of this in terms of the films sharing a unified vision and overall presentation, with a complete ensemble of players, without missing or aging cast members, and with the new locations & characters folding into the whole smoothly and naturally, is readily evident in this second film.  Likewise, while presenting awsome vistas and congregations of armies and elaborate and stunning battles, Jackson has not lost sight of the importance of the smaller more intimate scenes and relationships between Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli, Merry & Pippin, and most importantly Sam and Frodo.  We are well on the way to a masterpiece here.
We have new creatures ranging from flying dragons, to Orks mounted on viscious hyena-like critters.  We have a new beauty in Eowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, and we have Treebeard and his bretheren.  And last, but far from least, we have the astonishing creature Gollum/Smeagol, which is not only stunning technology, but even the more so because of the pathos and complexity of his character.
That Jackson makes the larger story comprehensible and delineates the various strands without losing the viewer is accomplishment enough.  But there is so much more to be had in this rich and complex film.  We can be grateful that cast and crew dedicated themselves so thoroughly to the project.
You can't please everybody, obviously, but I found the first and now this film immensely rewarding experiences.  And, for the record, I have NOT read the books, and I did NOT know the story beforehand.  In fact, I'm not a great fan of fantasy, but I am a great fan of brilliant movie-making, which for my money this is!",1041292800,2,2249,5.065040650406504

1470180,4,B00005JKZU,"Technically, this is a masterpiece. Gandalf's opening duel with the Balrog is the most extraordinary thing I've ever seen on film. The climactic battle sequences are astonishing, and WETA's Golum makes ILM's Jar Jar Binks and digital Yoda even more embarrassing (if that's possible) - Golum isn't a sprite, he's a living, breathing character. But despite the technical brilliance, the whole film left me a little disappointed - and, dare I say it, bored. The problem isn't with Jackson's stunning direction nor WETA's special effects. It's the screenplay. The books are so rich that any adaptation will be necessarily schematic, so it's a matter of choosing carefully what to show. ""Fellowship"" was easily the best page-to-screen adaptation ever written, but I think the choices made this time were less wise. In their enthusiasm for swash-buckling heroics and pseudo-erotic dream sequences, the writers have lost sight of the Ring. The epic quest is sidelined, and we're left wondering what all the fighting's about. Saving the final sections of the second book for the third film (presumably), doesn't help. I have no objection to this kind of shuffling (using the opening of the second book for the climax of the first film worked brilliantly), but here it fails. The story is deprived of unity and we don't get much sense of what's at stake, what Sauron's or Saruman's plans are, nor any real sense of anticipation about what might happen next. A little recapping and scene-setting at the beginning would have helped, too. More effective use could have been made of voice-over narration from Galadriel, as in ""Fellowship"" where she deftly summarized ""The Hobbit"" and the Ring's history in the opening minutes. Here, she's brought in at the 90-minute mark, but it's too little too late. The writers try desperately to reassert an epic tone by putting unreasonably eloquent speeches into Sam's mouth at the end, but it just doesn't play. I still give it 4 stars for technical brilliance, but in terms of story it's not a patch on the first.",1041292800,,2042,5.008823529411765

They only seem to be big at the end when they destroy Sauromon's plans, I always imagined that they were tall giants, and compared to Merry and Pippin they really weren't.. Other than the Ents, I was ok with the movie. Not everything is the same, but they did a really good job of it. My favorite part is the Gollum/Smeagol conversation, which made several of us Gollum fans crack up in the theater. I assume that the final movie will show Shelob's lair.

Saying that, however, I do not wish to demene the film as a whole, it is a 'good', 'acceptable', *watchable* film, with many twists, a couple turns and a good ol' fight scene. Though, it would be preferable to watch all three at once (imagine it... 3hrs per film, x3 films, you have a whole week-end of fantasy right there), for now just the two, or even just the one will do.

If you can, while you can, go to your local cinema and experience LOTR : TTT (yes, three T's!) in full on surround-sound widescreen action.

I say, don't look a gift horse in the mouth! Come on! The average person watching the movies hasn't read the books, and Peter Jackson must cater to this. The movie is already 3 hours long, and to bow to the fans every desire would be suicide.

A decent amount of fans are overlooking the fact that, these movies even exist to complain about in the first place. The computer effects are some of the best I've seen. Gollum is all CGI and I've never seen such a real CGI character! He's by far the star of the film. And another great thing about the CGI, is that Peter Jackson doesn't rely on it. It's there to bring Tolkien's world to life, but he makes his foundation on acting! The actors are superb. Frodo is starting to become distant as the ring dessimates him. Sam is getting more worried by the day. Aragorn is starting to show the stress of the quest, Gandalf is back but now distant, he doesn't even remember his name! Merry and Pippen become more entrenched with the battle for Middle Earth, as they urge the Ents into battle. Gimli and Legolas are a bit lacking in their supposed friendship, but it's easily overlooked as the battle for Helm's Deep encompasses them.

This film is damn good. All I'm hearing from Tolkien purists is little nit picky things about the characters. What I don't see, is them having their eyes wide open enjoying it for what it is! It's an awe inspiring film. Full of laughter, passion, war, hope, or even a lack of hope. These characters have chemistry, unlike Star Wars: Episode I or II, where the characters feel dull and inconsiderate of others... a lot like plastic figurines. Lord of the Rings; however, brings a full range of emotion to the silver screen. Peter Jackson has done a great job melding all three subplots in one seamless 3 hour movie.

For all the moaning and griping I hear, I do feel sorry for all the whiny Tolkien fans, because these films are the best they're going to get. A huge budget, a great cast of characters, and a really good story that takes place over three films. It's too bad all the fans (that don't realize this) can enjoy it for what it is!

1470321,5,B00005JKZU,"Funny thing about how movies affect people differently. I'm the only member of my family never to have read the Tolkien books. When I saw ""Fellowship of the Rings"", I was unmoved and bored, but my family just raved about it, and so did everyone else: my negative review was blasted at 64 disagreeing! But this time, I was completely into and greatly enjoyed ""The Two Towers"". Lights go up, and my brothers are ticked off by the movie because it departs from the book, evidently. Go figure!
Yes, ""The Two Towers"" is a solid work that even someone unconversant with the original trilogy can follow. I see some reviewers found it harder to trace than ""FofTR"", but as a veteran of 1970s disaster movies like ""Towering Inferno"" where action cuts from group to group, I was perfectly able to go from subplot to subplot. The animation of the Gollom character is a tour de force, the battle scenes are riveting. Everything is working excellently in this epic.
Point that kind of got me, though: Evil Christopher Lee has been able to possess some king long distance and create all these monsters and such. An omnipotent kind of fellow, an evil wizard. But when the Ents come and destroy his environs, his only response is to look out the window? He doesn't even say anything? I thought that was a little Too Passive. He needs to get in touch with his anger.
Still and all, ""Two Towers"" stands way above the latest Star Wars movie, and in my opinion, above ""Fellowship of the Ring"".",1041206400,,1472,4.579545454545454
1470322,5,B00005JKZU,This second installment of the Lord of the Ring series is simply amazing. The special effects will leave you breathless without sacrificing the story. The characters seem real in a story that could easily have been lost in special effects like Mr. George Lucas' Star War movies.,1041206400,,278,4.9361702127659575
1470323,5,B00005JKZU,"""The Two Towers"" leaves off exactly where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" ended. Sam and Frodo have embarked on their journey to Morden alone. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolis have gone in search of the kidnapped Hobbits, Merry and Pippin. And Merry and Pippin are being transported on the backs of marauding Orcs. Director Peter Jackson throws the audience headfirst into each of these plots, with the only nod to the twelve month gap between theatrical releases being a recap of Gandolf's fall into the abyss. As Middle Earth tries to defend against Sauruman's enormous military conjuring, the ring and Frodo's responsibility to destroy it seem almost irrelevant since the world must first survive the onslaught of military evil.
Is the movie good? Yes, very. Is it better than the first? It depends on what kind of movie you like. The first is an adventure/friendship movie while the second is more of a war movie, with everything leading up to an enormous battle scene. I found ""The Two Towers"" to have less drive and cohesion than the first, since the three plot lines remain separate and distinct. Jackson spends too much time showing us Merry and Pippin as they walk around with an Ent; in the interest of the dramatic medium, this should have been pared down, especially since these two Hobbits are not driving forces. Still, the acting is good (Mortenson as Aragorn is even more charismatic than he was in the first),and the story line is riveting. As with the first, the cinematography is breathless. The creation of Gollum, the poor tortured soul who is consumed for his need for ""my precious"" is simply brilliant. Wait until you see the wizardry of Gollum's computer generation! He is reminiscent of Yoda - but only if you could imagine Yoda as anguished, malnourished, mentally unstable, and consumed by the lure of the dark force.
If you saw ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and liked it, you won't want to miss ""The Two Towers."" If you didn't understand what the fuss was the first time around, you won't find enough to hold your interest in the second installment.",1041120000,3,2068,4.811797752808989

1470452,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers (TTT) is an absolutely astounding chapter in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  In many ways it exceeds its predecessor, the Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR), and in some ways it doesn't succeed as well.  In any case, there is no denying that it is another masterpiece of cinema that is setting a new standard for the action/adventure and fantasy genres, as well as setting a new example of quality and dedication for all movies in the future.
The story of TTT was already recognized as a work of literary magnificence and incomparable imagination when it was published in book form decades ago, and that story has lost practically none of its potency in Peter Jackson's adaptation.  The themes of good versus evil and hope versus despair are as strong as ever, and they shine in this movie.  The director's cinematic brilliance really comes to bear when he actually improves upon the book's fairly weak characterization, and his masterful knowledge of storytelling is obvious with many of the things he changed from the book.  Instead of bringing down the movie, many of the changes enhance its cinematic power, and Peter Jackson knows this.
Unlike FOTR, however, some of the more major changes did seem to degrade the story rather than enhance it.  The Arwen/Aragorn relationship is something that needed to be played on more, but the writers went too far and ended up beating it into the ground.  The addition of Frodo and company taking a trip to Osgiliath served almost no purpose and visibly threw off the flow of the story.  However, even these low points of the movie are handled excellently and are easily forgiven.
The acting continued with the same expertise as FOTR.  Elijah Wood handles Frodo's continued decent under the Ring's power with expertise, and performs equally well during those brief reprises of the old Frodo of the Shire.  Sean Astin's acting is just as good if not better than in the previous movie.  Viggo Mortensen continues to shine as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom is finally given some real screen time and manges to show us that he's really good at being an Elf, and John Rhys-Davies is brilliant as the gruff, gentle, warrior-comedian Dwarf Gimli.  Miranda Otto (Eowyn) works her magic wonderfully ninety-percent of the time, only giving a slightly manufactured scene once.  Her part in the Return of the King (ROTK) will be handled expertly if she showed us anything in this movie.  Bernard Hill, much like Miranda, shows his skill wonderfully in this movie, though his grief at his fallen son felt contrived rather than sincere.  But, to quote many other viewers, Gollum stole the show.  Andy Serkis was set to the task of playing one of the deepest and most tortured characters ever written and he performs it beautifully.  If only the Academy could see past the pixels, they might find Best Supporting Actor material.
The action in TTT is one aspect of the movie that will undoubtedly set a new standard for cinematic battles in the coming years.  Never before has an army looked so awe-inspiring, never has a battle of such immense proportions ever been attempted, and not once has it worked so well in such an epic way.  Although FOTR's battles were more enjoyable for their small-scale, personal involvement with the characters, TTT's battles take the gargantuan, impersonal battles of war to a new level that will not disappoint.  However, one personal battle in TTT does exceed all others; the battle of Gandalf versus the Balrog might be the most exhilarating battle ever put to film.  The only downfall of any of the battles was a very obvious lack of realism during some parts that pulled the audience out of the movie at times, but it does not ruin the movie by any means.
Howard Shore's score may not be as powerful as FOTR's all the time, but it definitely equals it in many parts and works extremely well as a second act.  The Rohan theme was extremely emotional, and, barring any surprise pieces of brilliance, Gollum's Song deserves the Oscar for Best Song this year.
The special effects of TTT are the best of any movie yet.  Gollum is, without a doubt, the most believable CG-created character ever, almost matching Andy Serkis's believability.  Many reviews have claimed that some of the CG shots of the Ents and Wargs were obviously CG, which is true, but they leave out the fact that the worst CG in TTT is better than most movies accomplish at their best.  The computer-generated armies at Helm's Deep will change movie making, which is enough said about that.
The biggest disappointment of TTT was the editing.  It simply felt rushed in parts, and there were times when the cutting was obvious.  The Extended Edition of TTT should fix this, but it was disappointing to see that TTT had to be hacked with a hatchet to fit within the three-hour time limit.
The minor faults of TTT cannot compare to the grand vision that is the Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson has done an excellent job of not only translating the book onto the movie screen, but he has made a movie that even non-Tolkien fans can enjoy supremely.  What's even more exciting is the prospect that the whole of these movies will be greater than the sum of its parts.  ROTK is going to complete one of the greatest achievements in film history, and it's almost painful to think of the one-year wait we have until we can finally see this great work complete.",1041120000,,5394,4.7502679528403
1470453,4,B00005JKZU,"I was expecting great things from this, the second part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I had seen the trailer and watched the behind-the-scenes special, but nothing prepared me for what the movie would really be like!  I sat in the theater with my mouth agape!  Peter Jackson outdid himself in this one!
The story begins with a flashback to Gandalf's epic battle with the demon (Fellowship of the Ring).  We find Sam and Frodo continuing their journey to Mordor, pursued by Gollum.  Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are tracking the Orakai that have captured their friends and fellow adventurers, Pippen and Merry.  Sauron and Saruman have joined forces and plot the destruction of man.  I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it yet (or read the books), so I won't reveal any spoilers here.  As the heroes continue on their journey, we meet and get to know new characters such as Wormtongue, Eowyn, Eomer, and King Theodon of Rohir and Faramir of Gondor.  Gollum's role becomes more important as he agrees to lead Frodo and Sam into the land of Mordor.
Readers of the book will be pleased at the movie version of Gollum.  This digital character is extremely advanced and believable as the multiple personality creature that craves The One Ring - his Precious.  In fact, at times you feel sorry for the creature.  At other times, you are actually fearful of him.  The battle scenes are above par.  Even better than those of the first installment.  You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat!  The special effects are so believable, that at times, you forget that some of this is actually CGI.
The length of the movie may deter some, but I actually heard some of the people in the theater complaining that they wanted MORE!!  Be warned, there are some scenes in this movie that I, a fan of the novels, did not expect to see until the third installment.  But I was not disappointed in the least.  I can only imagine what wonders Peter Jackson will wow us with in The Return of the King!",1041120000,,2007,4.555865921787709
1470454,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings starts out right where it left off. If you didn't see the first movie don't go thinking that you will be able to pick up on what happened. The movie doesnt start with some flashbacks to get you up to speed, or scrolling text like the Star Wars movies are known for.
Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is the continuation of the Fellowship of the Rings that came out this same time last year. Two Towers is the second of three movies in the series that is based off of J.R.R. Tolkien's books.
The movie has a great story that has developed over the two movies. This is what is driving people to the movie theaters. Since we last saw the fellowship the group had split up into three groups. We watch all three as they battle Sauron and try to destroy the ring before it fell into the wrong hands.
The movie relies heavily on visual effects. For a majority of the movie the visual effects were outstanding. The huge battle at Rohan could not of been possible without the superb work of the special effects team. 10,000 troops storming the castle was really well done. Gollum was also a really well done CGI character that provide some humor at watching this character interact with his duel personalities.
But the visual effects were also very poor in parts of the movie that made those parts look unreal. The scene in which the people of Rohan are migrating to the castle in which they can defend themselves they are met by a riding army of Org. The battling armies do not look to even be in the scene but rather floating on top of the picture. This scene was obviously an after thought of the visual effects team. I am sure they were totally consumed in the battle at Rohan.
The movie ran around three hours so make sure you want to sit for that long. I found this movie to be very entertaining and I love the story line. I definably cant wait till next year to watch the third and final installment in this series.",1041033600,,1930,4.319559228650138
1470455,5,B00005JKZU,"The two towers was definately a good film. It certainly surpassed the first film. The storyline was expertly duplicated from the original tolkien book. Sam and Frodo travel to Mordor in the company of the creature Gollum, which Frodo has apparently ""tamed"". Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli set out to find and rescue Merry and Pipin who were kidnapped at the end of the last movie. Upon the way they find Gandalf who was thought to have perished in the prequel. The Gandalf that they found was transformed and is no longer the waker Gandalf the Grey but is now the everpowerful Gandalf the white. the four travelers now set upon their quest for Gandalf had already found Merry and Pippin and had entrusted their well keeping to the tree-like creature (an ent) Treebeard. the four travelers set upon their journey to the kingdom of rohan. Their King,Theoden who was some what ""possesed"" by the dark wizard Saruman was cured by Gandalf. the Forces of Rohan then waged war between their Keep,(Helm's Deep) and saruman's forces. this battle was by far the most exciting part of the movie. the combination on stunning graphics and sword and arrow techniques make it by far the best of all movies since Gladiator. Meanwhile, while battle wages between the two superforces, Merry and Pippin convince thhe Ents to wage war against saruman. The ents succesfully dethrown saruman and seize his kingdom. The movie was a great one. You need not go to the cinema to see it's magnificence for i downloaded it on kazaa. but it you do decide to go to the cinema, be glad that you spent your money wiseley!!! Now go on and see the movie!!!
Try and wait for the return of the king. but read the book first.
Thanks for reading my review, do reccomend me!!

1470456,5,B00005JKZU,"This movie was so much better than FOTR.  At least a whole star's worth!  There is more emotion, and more concentration is dedicated to the individual characters.
Yes, Peter Jackson changed some things from the book, a lot of things; but, generally speaking, I think he enhanced the movie.
Sure, he added Arwen where she shouldn't have been, but being so little of a three-hour movie it's not as bad as it could have been.  Besides, did she really affect anything?
And, yes, little things along the way, including the Ent's reluctance to fight, were not as good as they could have been.  Yet, nothing's perfect [And I wish people would stop calling me nothing! : )] and Jackson did do a good job on the important parts.  Cut him some slack, will ya?
However, I do agree that Faramir should not have been so like Boromir.  That was one of the things I liked about the book -- that Faramir could sit down and be reasonable.  That he could learn from his brother's shortcomings.  Taking Frodo and Sam hostage -- and all the way into Gondor -- was just too much.  Well, too much if you want the book on screen.  For a separate story... it wasn't that bad a decision.  It did let you see Frodo succumbing more to the ring, anyway.  You wouldn't have seen so much a change in Frodo from his possession of the ring if this scene had not been added.  So it did have its good parts.
I almost forgot Gollum!  He was so lifelike!
But another mistake, if you can call it that, on Peter Jackson's part, was that he did not let Frodo even attempt to explain to Gollum why he ""betrays"" him later in the movie.  Of course Gollum does not understand!  More time should definitely have been devoted to this, or at least a reason why not.
All taken into account, I think this movie had a better feel to it than FOTR -- more REAL.  I appreciated there not being so many kooky camera angles as in the first movie.",1041033600,,1892,4.329545454545454
1470457,5,B00005JKZU,"For one, it's nice to only have to wait 1 year for the sequel, unlike Star Wars flicks where we have to wait three years or so.  This movie was unusual in that it began with a climax and did not go downhill from there.  Admittedly, it has been quite some time (at least 10 years) since I read the novels, so it's a bit difficult to make accurate comparisons between the movie and the book, but I was greatly impressed nonetheless.  The war scenes were remarkable, effects believable, and the story intriguing.  The most impressive feature in the films so far has been the elves; this is the first time elves have appeared in movies being tall, courageous and showing the full splendor of their cities (those familiar with the ""Dragonlance"" novels can liken these more to the elves of Qualinesti); normally they are shown as more fairie-like, with odd, high-pitched voices and dwelling in trees.
Anyways, the film was not quite as involving as the first, perhaps due to the fact that the first had to reel the viewers in for the setup.  As that's already been established, this film focused more on the battles for the survival in the human race of Middle-Earth.  There were a few confusing parts in relating the different cities/kingdoms of humans to one another, but I guess that's due again to the fact that I haven't read the novels for a while.  The tree-herders were very well done (their scene in the final sequence of the film was off the hook), and it would have been nice to see Gandalf call down some lightning or something more explosive in the last battle..  I assume there were a few characters missing, but Pete Jackson managed to stuff all he could into three hours and it turned out pretty well.  My biggest complaint would be the same as that for the first film, as there's more fruity hobbit interaction at the end of the film.  You kinda have to wonder about Frodo and Sam's relationship after their exchanged comments and endearing stares into one anothers' eyes- kinda makes you cringe.  Granted, the hobbits are a friendly folk, but the scenes take it a bit far.

1470459,3,B00005JKZU,"Far too many people have prattled on about how this film (and its predecessor) are among the greatest in Cinema history. Utter, utter bunk. This is a great rainy Saturday afternoon matinee, and if all that was being claimed for it were that, I'd give it four or five stars.
But no, there is a hard core of mediaeval battle revivalists (which, to my surprise, seems to comprise a large part of the film-going population) who say that with this series Peter Jackson has redefined cinema, and to them (well, you, I guess) I say he has done nothing of the kind, unless you call the cinematic equivalent of ""I Love 1983"" a re-definition of cinema.
Which is my first beef: far from being a ""triumph of the imagination"", this has to be one of the least original films I've ever seen. Every scene is saturated in clich. What perhaps ought to be respectful cap-doffing to celluloidal elders comes off as plain derivative - derivative, what's more, of B-Grade films: Gandalf is Ben Kenobi; the battle of Helm's Deep is the final scene of The Alamo; the ogres turning the treadmill to open the gates of Mordor ape Schwarzenegger's opening scene in Conan the Destroyer; the troll-like horsey things streaming across the uplands are straight out of Jurassic Park, the apocalyptic riders on their dinosaur-winged pterodactyls from that frightful Sinbad movie; the walking trees (walking trees? WALKING TREES?? Give me a break!) right out of Labryrinth. There is even a straight-faced impersonation of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, and one of those ugly bad dudes was so closely modelled on Nosferatu I'm not convinced it wasn't Max Schreck playing the part.
There was nothing new, no agenda set, no trail blazed at all: What you have is Willow, Excalibur, Labyrinth, Krull, Highlander, Clash of the Titans, Conan the Barbarian, the pilot for Robin of Sherwood and the serious bits (!) from Monty Python and the Holy Grail rolled into one big bag, and given a CGI budget that would make third world nations weep.
All of this with nothing more is still, of course, a pretty cool movie experience. It's grand, it's epic - they haven't made films with this sort of sweep for fifty years, so it's great to see - but Jackson's such a gifted director, and he's got a track record of making such perceptive, witty, moving pieces of cinema (see for example Heavenly Creatures and Forgotten Silver), that I think we're entitled to expect a little more. But that's all you get.
Part of the problem, I think, is over-reverence. THIS MOVIE IS SO PO-FACED IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. Like it or not, the idea of walking tree-shepherds is patently potty. So Tolkein thought of it: fine, if you can't bring yourself to do some judicial editing, put it in. But do you need to keep a straight face about it? A film in this genre desperately needs the off-the-ball wit and timing of a Jim Henson - or a Peter Jackson, for that matter - it really needs comic relief.  But Jackson dares not commit that sacrilege. The nearest he gets is a dwarf with a Brian Blessed fixation and a schizophrenic goblin thing with a ring complex, which you'll be glad to hear looks exactly like it sounds: i.e. a naked David Bowie.
You CANNOT expect (well - should not be able to, at any rate) an audience to sit through three hours of pre-Raphaelite mush featuring elfin dialogue (helpfully subtitled!), possessed kings, wizards on white chargers, immortal fairies and earthy maidens, legions of ugly monsters (ten thousand strong, sirrah) and leading characters who have nary a finger laid on any of them in three hours of non-stop close-quarters battle, in which the enemy body count can be measured in thousands, without at least a knowing wink.
But, even from Jackson, a knowing winker par excellence, there is none. All this effort, all this budget, all this talent, and what you get is a film which rests content on its surface thrills. The characters don't develop - the actors inject no personality or interpretation into their acting: the dialogue tells us that Frodo is becoming increasingly corrupted by the ring, but nothing in his actual performance does. Aragorn is the dullest hero-figure since Kevin Costner. And he never shaves, but his three day growth never grows. Christopher Lee is reduced to his stock in trade as a hammy evil-dude bit-part.
Finally, at the end of this buttock-torturing instalment, we are no closer at all to the quest than we were at the beginning. There's a working definition of gratuitous, if ever there was one.
Look, it's good, no doubt about that. Compared to Lara Croft, Tomb Raider or Battlefield Earth, it might seem like a work of genius. But in any context wider than that, it's just another sword and sorcery epic.
And really, what is with those walking trees?",1041033600,7,4796,4.7713598074608905

""Two Towers"".
I understand not being able to have everything in the movie that is in the books. BUT, I feel rewriting parts of a masterpiece is
unforgivable. The escape to and from The Prancing Pony should not
have been touched, the ride to Rivendale should have been as in the book. (The
Extended Version is much better.)
In the Two Towers it was unforgiveable for Jackson to have re-written the Chapters 4,5, and 6 of Book 4. He presents Faramir
falsely and destroys what Tolkien was trying to relate-that there
were some honorable men who would help Frodo and not try and steal the Ring. The movie would have been so much better if Jackson had just followed the books.
Jackson's creation of Gollum and Treebeard was magnificent and he
he did a wonderful job with them.

1470620,3,B00005JKZU,"Two Towers is much more than the empty CGI mess of the new Star Wars films, but it is nevertheless not the masterpiece that some people are claiming. The film is lavish and has nice moments; but there is a distinct lack of movement and structure to it that causes it to not quite work.
Specifically, the three major storylines never mesh or balance with each other. The two minor hobbits have nothing to do, and are extraneous characters. There is a general shapelessness to the film that makes it a confusing experience.
This shapelessness is due to the devotion to the storyline of the original book. This is a brave and foolish choice.
...
The acting and cinematography are often heavy-handed, boring and melodramatic. Do we really need to see so many sweeping shots of the countryside? And do the actors have to speak-so-slowly? As if this is The Ten Commandments. When Gimli jokes about Dwarvish women, the tone of the film is improved a lot. The film is taken too seriously: no whismicality or spontaneity (sp?) to speak of. Same flaw was in FOTR.
Enough has been said of the changes to the storyline that actually negate the story in the book. Specifically, the fact that we never know that the reason why Saruman had the minor hobbits captured is because they are thought to have the Ring. Saruman's rebellion against Sauron is never even alluded to! Frodo shows the ring to the Nazgul, thereby negating all the action of the War of the Ring, and also negating the surprise that the hobbits are supposed to have caused Sauron.
One final negative: some characters are corny. The voices of Gollum, the Orcs and the Ents are very corny. They sound like some cheap Saturday morning cartoon characters, as well as being nearly impossible to comprehend.
Now for the positives.
One: The film avoids many of the pitfalls of the preceding film. The static action scenes of the second half of FOTR ruined it for me; TT totally avoids that pitfall. The action scenes seem nicely paced, and actually have effect on the storyline! One action scene was invented for the film: the fight with the Warg-riders. However, this happened in The Hobbit; and besides, the sequence is very nicely done.
Two: the grittiness of the atmosphere improves the appearance of the film. Despite an excess of sweeping shots, mentioned earlier, the griminess of the surroundings makes the film more interesting that the continuous goldenness/cleanness of FOTR.
Speaking of which, the props and sets are still *too complicated*! A little less curlicue and a little more simplicity would be easier on the eye. However, that's more of a subjective point.
Three: Gollum still has some of the usual flaws of an animated character - i.e., the animators never seem to make him stay still, he has a silly voice. However, he is an interesting character, and the CGI does look as good as people say.
Four: the battle scenes are as impressive as people say, especially the various siege devices. Saruman is depicted as using gunpowder, which fits in with his love of machines and explosions!
 One minor point though: The orcs form up in very deep blocks-formations. No army in the world would form up in such deep formations. It makes the frontage of an army narrower, while getting no benefit from the rear ranks. This opens up the force to outflanking maneuvers, as well as being vulnerable to a collapse in the forward ranks. Ancient and mediaeval infantry would form up, on average, eight men deep. Yes, I know this is fantasy...
Overall, TT is not quite as good as people seem to think. It's incoherent and sometimes corny and melodramatic. But it is still an entertaining film; it ""works"" in that sense, I suppose.",1040947200,3,3682,4.77115987460815

The Two Towers cannot really be better then The Fellowship of the Ring because they are really, in a sense, the same movie, only cut into three different parts, and are being released at three different times. This film is, however, darker and alot more intense then The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring. I have seen it twice already, and I will gladly see it many more times.",1040860800,,523,4.402061855670103
1470622,5,B00005JKZU,"In this second movie, Peter Jackson makes far grander changes than he did in the first film.  Some dialog and plot has been simplified as it probably was needed to be, but there are also entire subplots that threaten to take our beloved characters in brand new directions.  These changaes seem to add as many problems as they add great moments.  However, Peter Jackson respects the source material and gently returns us to familiar territory in the end.  I actually enjoyed the overall philosophy, as it made this film a mostly new experience for me, instead of always knowing what to expact next.
Gollum is easily the best ""new"" part of this trilogy, as the most life-like CGI creation I've ever seen.  Rumors of a first-ever Oscar nomination for a CGI actor are well deserved, as Gollum forfills his place as the great mystery of this story, a character that completely captivates and mystifies.
Another high point is the huge final battle sequence at Helm's Deep.  I didn't think this was a great a some would tell you - it is basically an extension of the opening battle scenes in the first movie, with lots of orcs clashing from different directions of the screen.  I was much more impressed with the Clone Wars finale.
Of course, the Two Towers shares the same problems of the first movie, and in fact these weaknesses are intensified.  The pacing is still insanely fast and chaotic, cutting between 3, sometime 4 or 5 subplots!  The director sometimes overpowers his actors' fine performances with melodramtic shots and music.
Already, I am longing for the extended DVD version of this movie.  If it adds as much material as the Fellowship of the Ring, then I'm sure any problems I have with this movie will be solved.",1040860800,,1725,4.72
1470623,4,B00005JKZU,"Big is the word that best characterizes Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It's a film big in duration (179 minutes), big in special effects (just take a look at the army of tens of thousands of Uruk-Hais that Saruman is so proud of), and of course, big in intentions and scope.
It tells three different stories, involving the members of the former fellowship. The first story describes Frodo's and Sam's attempts to find their way to Mordor. The second story is about Merry and Pippin, being captive by a horde of Orcs. The final story starts with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli hunting down the Orc captors of Merry and Pippin and ends with the climax of the film, the over 35 minutes Helm's Deep battle.
What I did like about The Two Towers:
-- The opening sequence featuring the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog was effective and gripping. The film certainly starts with a bang.
-- I had my doubts about they way Ents (an ancient race of tree-like creatures) would appear on screen. Nevertheless, the result was most fitting.
-- The inner struggle of the Gollum was convincingly depicted. As for the Gollum itself, it was an impressive piece of CGI work.
-- The beautiful New Zealand landscape looks perfectly close to the Middle Earth that Tolkien himself had in mind.
What I did not like about The Two Towers:
-- I would prefer it if the director told the story more in Tolkien's original, magical spirit (something that was evident in the first installment of the trilogy), than transform it into an action-packed extravaganza - but admittedly an engagingly told one.
-- Seemed to me (probably mistakenly) that the producers decided to close the film a bit earlier than its natural book ending, giving it a more smooth finish, in order to avoid all this displeasure that viewers expressed by the way Fellowship of the Ring ""abruptly"" ended a year ago. In my humble opinion, the book ending would be more appropriate, having the viewers scratching their heads in anticipation.
Overall, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a grand movie, more easily accessible to the viewer than its predecessor, one that every fantasy adventure fan must see and should enjoy.",1040860800,,2175,4.741424802110818

I loved the 2 towers. it was good.",1040860800,,367,3.8933333333333335
1470625,5,B00005JKZU,"Gollum steals the movie. That said, here's the least you need to know.
The Two Towers is more sweeping in cinematography, and darker in plot than was Fellowship of the Ring. But we knew that going in. Is it as good as the first film? Yes. Did I enjoy it more? No. Perhaps Fellowship provided more the joy of discovery. Towers provides overt, uncompromising, Middle Earthshaking action.
Orlando Bloom (Legolas) will once again steal the hearts of teenage girls, however the finest performance (other than Gollum) comes from Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue. Though not a large part, his portrayal is superb nonetheless. Gimli the dwarf is much more entertaining in this second installment, and the humor of John Rhys-Davies (""...toss me!"") is more elaborated. Elijah Wood continues to do a quality job as Frodo, the Shireling hobbit beginning to feel the weight of the One Ring's corrupting influence.
One silly inclusion in the film is Legolas' skateboarding down the Helm's Deep ramp while shooting Orcs. Most of the special effects in Two Towers however, are nothing short of spectacular. Gollum is as real as computer graphics can create, although the Wargs were somewhat disappointing. The Oliphants-though featured only briefly, are quite good, and the Ents are even better. Their hurling of the great stones in the spectacular flood destruction conclusion is a highlight, though watching them lumber across Fanghorn Forest brought flashbacks of Jurassic Park.
The Battle of Helm's Deep is as good as advertised, however I somehow thought it would take up a bigger part of the film. No complaints though-it is Middle Earthshaking to say the least. Especially welcome are the numerous foreboding glimpses of Mount Doom where the story concludes in the final chapter, and the eerie futuristic death of Aragorn is captivating.
Tolkien's passion for religious themes pervade the story, and knowledgeable Bible students will easily spot them. The two natures of everyman (Gollum), as described in Romans 7, and the deceit of unwise council (Wormtongue) are primary examples. The arrival of the resurrected Gandalf (with a `new name') from the east, riding a white horse followed by a great host, is an overt parallel to the return of Christ at Armageddon. So good is the concluding battle in fact, that Helm's Deep seems to be Armageddon, only by another name.
In addition to the obvious resurrection theme, the story exemplifies for us the importance of valuing good for the sake of good (as Sam tells Frodo), and makes us recognize that every creature of God (even Gollum) has some redemptive merit. ""I have to help him, Sam, because I have to believe he can come back"", says Frodo of the most pathetic and pitiful creature ever to grace a silver screen. (Parents, be advised that Gollum may unnerve small children.)
The limits of tolerance (evil must be seen for what it is and destroyed) become immediately relevant to America's fight against terrorism. Environmental awareness is also portrayed as Treebeard references Saruman's ""mind of metal"". ""The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall"", gloats the evil sorcerer.
Finally, the theme of self-sacrifice is not to be overlooked in Two Towers. Tolkien's world is full of characters who give up something precious. Frodo gives up his chance to possess the ring; Arwen--her immortality, for Aragorn, and Sam risks his life Frodo.
Yes, computer-generated graphics they may be, but along with the grand and sweeping cinematography across the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand, special effects make The Two Towers a bona fide new-style epic. Pity we must wait a year to watch good ultimately triumph over the shadows of darkness, best articulated by Sam when he tells Frodo, ""In the end, it's only a passing thing, this darkness. ... There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for."" A conclusion worth waiting for, and just as importantly-we will finally see the Shelob!",1040860800,15,3964,5.071975497702909
1470626,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is the second instalment in the LOTR trilogy of the Tolkien classic. The story continues with the quest in the first movie, but it just gets darker. The first movie we saw the light and the dark in a very discreet manner, but in Two Towers, everyone is in the state of internal struggling. Gollum, the CG character acted by a real actor has more coverage in this second movie and the description of its struggling between the good and the evil is very vivid and heart throbbing. Peter Jackson surely has put in a lot of effort to bring Gollum to life. Frodo is now struggling with the ring that he bears. His mission is to destroy the ring in the fires of Mordor, but at the same time the ring is fighting its will to survive by trying to get control of the ring bearer and seduce him to the dark side. Elijah Wood gave a promising performance as Frodo, though Aragon and Legolas might still be stealing the show a bit. Aragon is now facing the dilemmas of yielding himself to the fate or grip hold to his heart?s resistance. He still chose to fight, but try to avoid the fate as the heir to the incomplete mission of destroying the evil. Legolas tasted the death of his elvish allies and fought with pain in the battle. Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom once again brought these two characters into real life. We can feel the existence of these roles through them. Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette and Hugo Weaving all have short appearances in this second movie, in which they were not originally in the book. Their parts are mainly to finish off the unfunished plot in the first movie, so that the two movies would be weaved together in a tighter manner. Miranda Otto?s did well as Eowyn the human princess. Her hidden emotions for Aragon were well expressed. Despite she knows that Aragon?s heart is with Arwen, she still tried to do her best to care for Aragon, without the expectation of getting anything in return. She is a well done character but could be sterner and strong, for this was one of the major differences between Arwen and Ewoyn that made Aragon feels something for Eowyn. David Wenham as Faramir did not really receive a lot of attention in the movie, but he is a well known Australian actor, so he could probably receive more attention in Australia with his good performance as Faramir. Without doubt, Ian McKellen gave a spectacular performance as Gandalf the White and it is just an icon of the whole saga. People would expect and enjoy his company throughout the movie. Christopher Lee as Sauraman did not have as much part as the first movie, but it is a good break and wash away form his similar and confusing role as Count Dukoo in Episode II of the Star Wars saga.
One thing to be mentioned is that the story of the second movie has quite a bit of change in the plot. Die hard Tolkien fans might find this a bit offended. Basically the whole story is still there, the plot is the same plot, but in some of the details, things were swapped around to produce a more dramatic effect on the movie screen. The whole movie was really well done, and it seems it is more breathtaking than the first movie. However, if people are looking for a real original reproduction on the screen, that could be disappointing for them. The special effects are great and the sceneries are spectacular. No wonder why in my friend?s recent trip to New Zealand, they actually brought them to the location of the movie.
This is definitely a good choice for all movie goers, no matter you have read the book or not.",1040860800,14,3527,4.461300309597523
1470627,5,B00005JKZU,"I've seen The Two Towers twice since its arrival in the theaters, and believe it to be better than part 1. Part 1, excellent as it was, is an introduction of characters and milieu, the terrain rising toward the story that lay ahead. This second installment ascends to the plateau and delivers a Romantic vision of epic proportions. It equals in sweep, gravity and visual and emotional impact any epic tale that has ever been put on film.
For once, something hyped and oversold lives up to all the claims made for it by waiting fans and the films makers. Please understand, I am not a Tolkienite. I have no vested interest in selling this series. But take the word of an unbiased viewer: it IS an awe-inspiring, frightening, sad, stirring, funny film. It's about hope, faith, love and obsession.

1470775,5,B00005JKZU,"For the second time, Peter Jackson, works wonders in bringing JRR Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings' to life, and the Part II: The Two Towers is even more stunning than the first.

As a long-time fan of the books, I was very skeptical that the big screen could really do these works justice, but Peter Jackson, and everyone else who worked on this amazing project, has proved that it certainly can!

The hideous and destructive evil of the Orcs, Wargs and Black Riders is made even more frighteningly stark, and it is with a sense of wonder that we are introduced to the people of Rohan; the Ents and the horrible, crawling, scheming Gollum.

For me the highlight of the film is the Battle of Helms Deep, where a 10 000 strong horde of Orcs, Uruk-Hai and Hillmen from Isengard besiege the people of at this ancient fortress, and the ensuing battle shows the great courage and determination to survive of the besieged and their allies.

Seeing the innocent, beautiful faces of the children of Rohan, hiding with the women in the fortress, and then being flashed to the cruel terror of Saruman's forces is a contrast I will never forget, as Aragorn reminds us that the forces of Saruman are determined to destroy the people of Rohan, down to the last child.

In a clear analogy of propaganda for terrorism., Saruman works the Hillmen into a bloodlust, telling them that the Rohirrim took away their land and drove them into the hills, and now they must burn, destroy, and kill all in their path.

And it is with a sense of grand triumph, that we see Gandalf and the cavalry of Rohan charging down the hill to break the siege; and the army of angry Ents destroying Isengard

The message in the film is what makes it so remarkable and encouraging at this difficult time in human history.

Here is placed a monumental battle between good and evil, without any of the relativism or moral blur that blight our age.

The free world is under threat by dark and evil forces that have a demonic drive to destroy all that is good, just and beautiful.

And the question that faces us all today is asked King Theoden of Rohan: `How do we deal with such reckless hatred'.

Aragorn, the only answer that points the way to the truth, gives the clear answer: `Ride out and meet it, head-on'.",1040774400,,2268,4.52078239608802
1470776,5,B00005JKZU,"It's hard to know where to begin in articulating a coherent summary of so spectacular an epic as Peter Jackson's rendering of Tolkein's masterpiece. Perhaps the most incisive comment I can make is that, having been a fan of ""The Lord of the Rings"" since I first read the trilogy nearly 35 years ago, I'm impressed by Jackson's fidelity to the spirit of the original literary work.
""The Two Towers"" is a very different kind of film than its predecessor. Don't expect the intimacy of ""The Fellowship of the Ring""; the evolution of the story precludes it. The dissolution of the Fellowship scattered the principal characters of the first film into three distinct sub-plots: Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), whose capture by the Uruk-Hai takes them into Fangorn Forest and their ultimate influence on the fate of Saruman (Christopher Lee); Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), who re-unite with a resurrected Gandalf (Ian McKellan) in the climactic battle of Helm's Deep; and Frodo (Elijah Wood) & Sam (Sean Astin), who continue their quest to destroy the Ring at Orodruin (ably played by Mount Doom) in Mordor. That's a lot of threads to weave into the overall tapestry of the story, and it necessarily calls for some fairly abrupt and rapid scene changes.  The action is so fast-paced that you will barely have time to catch your breath.
One of the most personally meaningful aspects of the film -- and so far, it has been true of both ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" -- is Jackson's uncompromising adherence to Tolkein's vision of the timelessness of the story itself. The author was determined NOT to write a story that served as an allegory for any of the current events of his time, but rather hoped to address much broader issues that are rooted in the fundamentals of human nature. In so doing, the trilogy has remained relevant to the human condition in a way that transcends nationalities, ethnicities, and the various idiosyncratic cultural zeitgeists of any of the historical periods it has spanned. I find real personal relevance in Aragorn's struggle with his own destiny. It's not a predetermined kind of destiny, as in ""fate"", but rather the self-determined destiny of one who follows his heart and his own integrity. Ditto for Eowyn (Miranda Otto), whose struggle to fulfill her desire for valor in the service of good is established in ""The Two Towers"", and will culminate in the final installment, ""The Return of the King"".
But Jackson's triumph runs much deeper than his artistry in character development; many great films share that characteristic. It is his mastery in the use of surpassing technological innovation as an aid in the storytelling rather than as an end in itself that raises the bar for all subsequent films. His combination of digital, fabricated, and natural scenery in creating the world of Middle Earth is simply breathtaking. The battle scenes are terrifying without being overwhelming in their reliance on gratuitous violence or gruesome bloodshed. [I will allow my daughters (8 and 12 years of age) to watch the films, and I am probably more protective of their sensibilities than most parents I know.] And Jackson's creation of the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) is without equal or precedent in filmmaking history. Gollum is more than simply ""believable""; he is real. His role in the story is pivotal, and it was Jackson's test of fire to create an all-digital character whose range of expression and movement could carry such an important part in the story. It is a masterpiece of moviemaking art.
It will seem incomprehensible to the uninitiated that my only lament about the three-hour film is that it is too short. That's hardly a criticism, for Jackson has included everything that is relevant to the story line in setting the stage for the trilogy's climax in the third film. As a matter of practicality, the film can't exceed three hours for simple economic reasons. A longer film would mean fewer showings -- not good for the profitability of movie theatres -- or a higher price of admission, which would not be popular with moviegoers. So, the filmmaker has had to accommodate those constraints, and I believe it's a job well done.
Still, it's inevitable that one who has read the book will find discrepancies or omissions in the film, but that's not the basis of my wish that the film were longer. Rather, it's more a matter of being sorry that it was over at the end. ""The Two Towers"" is so captivating, so utterly engrossing a film-watching experience, that I found myself wanting more. What better statement could one make about the success of the filmmaker who wants his customers to come back for the third and final part of this epic trilogy? The consolation to those who want more will undoubtedly be in the release of the special edition DVD, which -- like its counterpart for ""The Fellowship..."" -- will add significant additional footage to the theatrical version.
Finally, for all the unparalleled technological excellence of the film, the most compelling reason of all to see it is the story itself. If you love great movies crafted by professionals with vision who tell a remarkable story exceedingly well, you simply must see ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's clear that the trilogy has found a special place in moviegoers' hearts. I saw ""The Two Towers"" at Edwards Cinema in Brea, California at a matinee showing on December 23, 2002, in a full-house audience of people of all ages. When the initial title ""The Lord of the Rings"" appeared on the screen, the audience spontaneously burst into applause. I have never seen that happen at any movie I have ever attended, and for good reason - there has never been a movie like this before.",1040774400,166,5777,4.888888888888889
1470777,4,B00005JKZU,"Shelob? Who or what is that? If you haven't read the book, don't worry, you'll meet her in the beginning of Return of the King, next Christmas. In Tolkien, however, Shelob appears at the very end of The Two Towers.
 There are three major ""parts"" to this movie, each ""part"" has its own cast. They are as follows:
 The Sam, Frodo, and Gollum part: Sam and Frodo continue to take the ring to Mordor, however, they get lost. Gollum, from now on known as Smeagol (Smee-Goal), finds them and promisesss to lead them to Mordor, yesss. As far as CGI characters go, Smeagol far surpasses Yoda. In fact, Smeagol is of the same quality--and perhaps better--than the human-like CGI characters in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. That's saying ALOT. The best part of the Sam/Frodo/Smeagol part is watching Smeagol have conversations with himself. One part of him is despiccably evil. You hates Smeagol, yesss. The other part of him is rational, trying to be good. You likes Smeagol.
 The Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli part: The three are still searching for Merry and Pippin but with no luck. They end up meeting King Theoden and his dark servant (Wormwood? Wormtongue? It's been awhile since I read the book). Gandalf the White appears and performs a sort of excorcism on the possessed King Theoden. Now that he's rational again (sorta), King Theoden marches his people to Helm's Deep, a strong fortress and place of safety. There, the main characters of this part and their forces make a stand against some 10,000 enemies. This last battle is really excellent, except for the fact that Peter Jackson has a nasty habit of getting too close to the action sometimes, resulting in blurry scenes of action.
 The Merry and Pippin part: The two hobbits escape from the Orcs and find themselves in Fangorn forest, where they're found by a kindly Ent (A walking, talking tree). This part is very short in comparison but the end where the Ents attack Isengard is worthwhile.
 Fellowship of the Ring was very linear but easy to follow. The Two Towers skips around the three ""parts"", sometimes making it hard to follow. Also, I found the Two Towers to be much slower moving--especially the middle. But don't let these things prevent you from seeing this movie. It still TOWERS over most fantasy movies and even movies in general.",1040688000,8,2306,4.78391959798995
1470778,5,B00005JKZU,"The second movie in the trilogy, while not as true to the book's storyline as the first release, is still absolutely breathtaking entertainment. Some fans of the book will no doubt cry foul at some of Peter Jackson's additions, but the movie was still very entertaining and worth multiple viewings for book and movie fans.
I thought this movie would be much more violent and overall darker than the first - I was wrong.  Because the movie ends differently than the book, a large portion of that ""dark"" part is left for the third movie, ""Return of the King.""  If you could handle the violence in the first one, you should be fine with the second one.
One of the best performances was from Gollum, a.k.a. Smeagol, the creature that's hunting the ring.  Yes, I realize his performances wasn't simply the performance of one man, but a team.  Still, it was absolutely riveting at parts.  He totally lived up to my expectations, and even surpassed them.
If you're interested in some of the additions Peter Jackson added to this film that weren't in the book (or not featured as prominently):
- the romance between Aragorn and Arwen is not touched very much, especially not in the second book.  Not at all to the extent seen in the movie.
- A scene that involves Aragorn (I'll say it's before the Elves come to Helm's Deep... the Elves are also not in the book) is not present in the book.
- Treebeard the Ent, a new character in the second book, is not portrayed quite how I would have done it. He seems surprised to learn of the slaughtered trees, though in the book he knows of it the whole time.  The same result is in both book and movie, but I think Treebeard is a little too hasty in the movie.  Still, I did enjoy him, as the Ents are my favorite characters in the series.
Overall, an entertaining movie that definitely gives you your seven bucks' worth.  And that's what a movie in the theater is supposed to do, right?  (I have a theory about how book-to-movie adaptations may be changing with the release of the Fellowship of the Ring: Special Extended Version DVD, but that's for another time and place!)

I think of all the films I have seen in theaters this year Two Towers is definately my favorite.  I know Lord of the Rings fans will love it...and I think those who aren't fans will still love it.

1470780,2,B00005JKZU,"I hated The Two Towers. Now, I'm not such a purist that I hate any kind of deviation from the books, but in The Two Towers Peter Jackson didn't just change some scenes, he also changed major characters and consequently the whole logic behind the story. Why?! I can only think of one reason: everyone in the cinema must be convinced that Aragorn is the one true hero of the movie. Let me explain. In the last half hour of TFOTR we see Aragorn refuse the Ring. In the books it is Faramir who does that. Faramir is a noble character. As noble as Aragorn, but more human and therefore more likable. In the movie Faramir has changed into an evil carbon-copy of Boromir who captures the hobbits and takes them to the city of Osgiliath only to release them after Frodo (who strangely has changed into a Psycho-hobbit, but then *Sam* has turned into Marten Luther King apparantly, with all the speeches he spews - with apologies to MLK) has nearly given the Ring to the Nazgul. Now, what is the one great big underlying logic in the books? Why do Frodo and Sam succeed against such great evil? Because Sauron - being evil - cannot comprehend that anybody who posessess the Ring won't use it. Aragorn looks for that purpose into the Palantir, so Sauron will get distracted (Sauron expects Aragorn to have the Ring and use it) and to buy the Ringbearers more time. That's why the great big battles are being fought, against overwhelming odds, against all better judgement: to buy more time because you cannot fight evil with swords and arrows (hear that mr Bush?). In the movie however, it's all about swashbuckling Aragorn who almost singlehandedly battles 10.000 orks. Everybody else are supposedly idiots who simply don't know what they're doing (Theoden suddenly becomes a stupid stubborn king who leads his people into a trap at Helmsdeep, Faramir turns into a baddie - why should Eowyn ever fall in love with *him*?) and Sauron and the Nazgul are - for all that Sauron is a giant all-seeing Eye - simply blind: they literary see Frodo with the Ring in Osgiliath, they now KNOW the Ring is carried by a Hobbit near their borders, but they simply ignore that fact and let him crawl into Mordor. Yeah, sure. Add to that a lot of annoying, unnessesary botched details (Gandalf claiming to have lived in Middle-Earth for 300 years instead of 2000, the Warg-fight and Aragorn falling down a cliff - hello? are we talking about the same books here? - and Legolas surfing down some stairs on a shield, not to mention the lost chances in regard to the Ent-scenes) and you know why I exited the cinema with clenched fist, all but foaming round the mouth. If the FotR had been equally bad, I would have just shrugged my shoulders but because the FotR was so utterly brilliant I could have just wept. Such opportunities you had, Peter Jackson, and you botched it! The only reason I give two stars is because Gollum was so spot on. The only one in the entire movie perhaps who stayed in character. Too bad.",1040688000,31,2989,4.567970204841713
1470781,4,B00005JKZU,"I'm pretty sure I feel this way because it's the middle of the trilogy...and middles are usually the least of all three.  Because..well...it's the MIDDLE, which means that there really isn't a beginning or an end, and events that are supposed to be triumphant accomplishments come off as hardly climactic; they just make you think: ""Okay, this is good, but there's far more to come. GET ON WITH THE STORY!!!"".
Now, don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, and if you like the first one, you obviously have to see it. But while ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best, the all-time greatest, THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER MADE, ""The Two Towers"" comes off as nothing more than an enjoyable action/war movie.
Needless to say, ""The Two Towers"" is very different from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  War has broken out in Middle Earth, and the Fortress of Sarumon, has formed a legion with the Tower of Sauron (I forgot the names of both towers...in fact, I don't think either names are mentioned once in the movie!). The story now parts three seperate ways: Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are now on a quest to rescue Merry and Pippin from the band of Uruk-hai that captured them at the end of the first film.  But they have escaped, into the hands of the kind Treebeard, an Ent.  This part of the story tends to drag, and only kicks in at the end, when the Ents assault on Isengard, and kick those Orcs' butts!  (Watching Sarumon (Christopher Lee) just stand there in the window in disbelief and watching his fortress crumble at the hands of the Ents, while kind of stupid as he doesn't try to do a bloody thing and just stands there doing nothing, is very pleasing to behold.)
Now, on to Frodo and Sam, who continue their quest to destroy the One Ring. On the way, they meet up with Gollum, whom they force to lead them to Mordor. Gollum is, of course, computer-animated, but it is barely noticeable.  Over time, Frodo becomes more and more close to Gollum, and the two form an unspoken friendship.  Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo are growing more and more apart, as the Ring begins to consume Frodo.  Andy Serkis, as the voice and movements of Gollum, gives the best performance in the whole movie; you really get to feel for Gollum, and pity him and all the hardships he has faced at the hands of the Ring.
This section holds the most drama in the movie, in watching the two hobbits' friendship drift apart, and Gollum's sorrow.  Unfortuanately, the whole story seems far less concerned with the Ringbearer's task (which should be the centerpiece of the movie), and far more with Aragorn, as he bands with the men of Rohan against the army of 10,000 Uruk-hai at the Battle of Helm's Deep, the biggest movie battle perhaps, ever.  However, while the battles in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" had you literally jumping out of your seats and holding your breath, the battles in ""The Two Towers"" don't, and this is ultimately harmful to the movie.
Also, the music isn't a tenth as well as in the first installment, which was the finest music ever written.  The only reliefs are when old tunes from the first one are recycled.
The characters are really drawn down to two-dimensional status, especially those of Gandalf and Sarumon.  Gandalf comes off as nothing more than a glowing thing who comes to save the day.  Sarumon is now nothing more than a pale spectre standing around and looking menacing.  In the first movie, he was the ultimate screen villain, and made you love to hate him, and hate to love him.  Simillarly, Gandalf was once a powerful personification of all that is good in the universe, and Ian McKellen should've won his Best Actor Nomination at the Oscars. Now, he's hardly even essential to the movie, or so it seems.
There is much more background of the love relationship between Aragorn and Arwen, and you truly feel for the love that is shared between them, and for the sacrifices they are willing to make for eachother.  The choice that Arwen must make in the end is devistating, and heart-breaking.  But the addition of another woman in the story is pointless, and does nothing more than add a stupid love triangle.
A major plus to the film is the comedic relief mainly based on the relationship between Legolas and Gimli.  It's very funny!
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a fantasy with equal amounts of drama and action.  ""The Two Towers"" is hardly as great as that was.
The focus is more on the world of men, and %99.9 of the magic and awe that dominated the first film is lost here, and the world of Middle Earth seems no more than an area of our world that is barren of cities. In ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", you were totally swept away into another world, and forgot all reality. Well, not anymore.
Like I said, it's a war movie, as well as the middle of a story.  So the pace is (or atleast tries to be) more hectic, action-packed, bloody, dark....and in the end it is depressing and disappointing, as you'll walk out of the theatre feeling.  (As I did one hour ago.)
Like I said, it's worth seeing, but it's nowhere near as good as the first film. Let's just hope that things shape up a bit in ""The return of the King""!  (I'm sure thay will.)",1040601600,4,5160,4.513948497854077
1470782,5,B00005JKZU,"""Lord of the rings: the Two towers"" is undeniably the number one film of 2002. It's an awe-inspiring fantasy. The savagery of warfare and the presence of fatality being imagined with such sumptuousness haven't been this good in a long time. The beautiful cinematography is bound to impress you. The movie does get a little slow around the middle when Aragorn dreams of Arwen but the movie soon paces up quickly. Despite the fact that the movie isn't as hearty as the first one (Fellowship of the rings), this sequel is even better. The suspense, battling the Orcs, and the visual pleasure of the eye-catching landscapes is all wonderful. The movie even has the soothing score to fit the scenes making the scenes perfectly in the mood of the movie. The movie is a mind-blowing, mind-boggling masterpiece of a mess!  The Two towers is the middle third of an epic that will doubtlessly excel as one of the most courageous and victorious films in motion-picture history. It's an epic of grandeur. Spectacular, thrilling, and significantly touching, it's the very description of heroic adventure. It has the fighting that `Star Wars episode II' has, the heroic adventure that `Spiderman' has, the moving scenes that `The good girl' has, and the imaginative creatures not to mention a great novel that `Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets' has so in short `The two towers' is a wrap-up of all the critically successful films of 2002. Peter Jackson's excellent movie makes you forget that the most horrific and sinister scenes are yet to be seen in 2003's `Lord of the rings: The return of the king'. It's a thought-provoking work of art. It makes you wonder how the third movie will ever compete with the second but that's what we thought when we watched the first movie. The cast ensemble was of coarse excellent and the battle of Helm's Deep is one of the best, most outgoing battle sequences ever to be showed on the big movie screen. The movie will have you at the edge of your seat at all times. You'd forget everything. It's just like actually playing the Two towers game. Now this is filmmaking on a supreme level; inspiring, stirring, and ideal. When the hours long movie is over, you can just not stop wanting more. The movie is definitely built on numbers like the countless numbers of Orcs, the movie budget, the prediction of the movie's box-office gross, and let's not forget the 26,000 extras.
 The balance of supremacy is uneven across Middle-earth. Two Towers - the Dark Lord Sauron's dominating place at Barad-dr and the wizard Saruman's place at Orthanc - have allied to fight in opposition to all civilization, and bring about the ending of the race of Humankind. The mortifying evil of The One Ring, forged by Sauron, has split the Fellowship that stuck together to destroy it. The quest has already claimed the life of the Wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the Human Boromir (Sean Bean). Only the Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) has shown some resistance to its great power, which makes him solely capable to be the Ring bearer. Now Frodo must face his fate unaided. Accompanied only by his reliable companion, Sam, Frodo goes into evil lands uninformed that he is on the trail of Gollum who previously owned the ring. I won't tell you the rest. It'll spoil it!
 Overall it's an exceptional movie. It's something that'll get rave reviews in all reader's (watcher's) response journals. The Fellowship of the rings showed why the ring was important to the characters and now the sequel explains why the ring is important to us. The sequel is something you can watch for a long time on the cinemas while you wait for the third movie in the trilogy. Peter Jackson is like Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Cleopatra-1963) in the way that he uses an expensive budget to make his movie a masterpiece also not caring how long the movie runs for. He is also like David Lean (Dr. Zhivago) in the way that he uses spectacular cinematography to impress us. And last but not least he's like Steven Spielberg in the way that he creates movies that impress the generations and in the way that he will too leave a great effect in motion picture history.",1040601600,65,4157,4.731034482758621
1470783,4,B00005JKZU,"I loved the movie.  If you want to know what the movie did right, read the hundreds of other reviews.  They're probably all correct.  The action scenes were fantastic, the music was engaging, and the movie itself was great.
All of this was also true of the Fellowship of the Rings movie, however, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel with few exceptions, such as Arwen taking Frodo to Rivendell.  This particular change was so female movie-goers wouldn't feel so left out.
Unfortunately, Jackson abandons his dedication towards authenticity in favor of his own revisions this time around.  In the middle of the movie, a twenty-minute segment shows up that will not be found in any version of the book.  The scenes prominently feature three characters who aren't even in the Two Towers book.
*Spoilers*
Twenty minutes of Arwen, Elrond, and Galadriel that had no purpose except to let those viewers who for whatever reason thought the Lord of the Rings was a love story have their moments of happiness, and maybe so Jackon could have those actors in all three movies.  The only other purpose of the segment was to provide of a reason for a few hundred Elven archers to show up at Helm's Deep.
Mr. Jackon, if you're going to add elements to the story, you don't have to spend an eighth of the movie setting up for it.
There were numerous other new things (Aragorn going off the cliff, a shameless copy of the gunpowder-""keep that candle away"" scene from Army of Darkness, and the Uruk-hai's use of World War I seamines.  All of these are fine.  Really, they are.  They make the movie more dramatic, give it style.  In my opinion, it's an acceptable transition from book to movie.  The twenty minute segment though...ugh.
It's a great movie, but I am of the people who read the book long before this movie was announced.  I couldn't help walking out of the theater with a little bit of disappointment.",1040601600,8,1903,4.661676646706587
1470894,4,B00005JKZU,"Okay, first off let me say ""READ THE BOOKS""!
I was so impressed with Mr. Jackson's first effort, ""The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring"", that I had NO anticipation of being disappointed in his second effort.  Especially after his ""Special Edition"", if anything, followed the books more closely than the original theatrical release.  It was hard to believe anyone could have done such an excellent job.  Sure there were changes, but the ""spirit"" was certainly preserved.
I'm not going to give away any plot lines, but I could barely recognize this as the second book.  There were additions, and deletions.  Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson seems to have lost his road, fallen from grace, or in general, not done what I thought he should.  Yeah, I would have probably done much worse than he, but I am critiquing the movie.  I certainly don't envy him the task of putting this work on film, but he started so well, why did he deviate?  Maybe it was because he went from two, to one, to three movies.  I don't know the reason, but I'm truly sorry to say - this one doesn't measure up to the first.  At least, not for the purist fans of the novels.  I'm not saying the movie was bad, I'm saying I was disappointed.  Why did he feel the need to deviate so many times, and in so many places?  Of course, who can argue with his box office?  And, yes it is a good movie; just not a great movie.  I felt after the first movie, we were all in for a marvelous treat, an unparalleled achievement.  Now, I fell like we're in for a treat, just not a breathtaking one.",1040601600,4,1561,4.368055555555555
1470895,5,B00005JKZU,"I have just arrived home from the cinema after watching The Two Towers. It is all I can think about! I absolutely loved The Fellowship Of The Ring and thought The Two Towers couldn't possibly be any better - but I was proved wrong! Words can't begin to describe how amazing this film is. The Two Towers has gone straight in at No. 1 in the US Box Office grossing a staggering $61 million in its first five days of release - did anyone expect anything less? There may be spoilers ahead in this review, so if you don't want to know about it, don't read on!
The most noticable change about The Two Towers from The Fellowship Of The Ring - for me - was the increasing addition of violence, power, war and darkness. There is much more of it than in the first edition of The Lord Of The Rings, which is not surprising considering all the stuff that needed to be squeezed in. Speaking of this, I was delighted when realising that The Two Towers isn't full of half an hours' twaddle-talk like The Fellowship Of The Ring; the story begins straight away without any hesitation. At first it seems strange, but after the first twenty minutes or so, you forget all about it and succumb to the powers of this extraordinary film. After The Fellowship was left broken at the end of the first enstallment, there are three main storylines in The Two Towers that follow in the order of Frodo/Sam, Merry/Pippin and Legolas/Aragorn/Gimli.
In the Frodo/Sam subplot, the two continue their quest to return the One Ring back to Mordor - the dark and hellish realm of the Dark Lord Sauron - and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom. The longer Frodo (Elijah Wood) has the ring within his possession, the more chance he has of succumbing to the evil powers of the One Ring. On their way, they meet up with Gollom - the monster who has been following them hoping to claim the ""precious"" ring for himself. Hinted at in the introduction of The Fellowship Of The Ring, Gollom (superbly voiced by Andy Serkis) was once the ring bearer but his greed and need for the ring over-powered him and turned him into the monster he is today. The pathetic wretch offers to guide the Hobbits to the dark realm, his tortured mind wavering between servitude and treachery. Sam (Sean Astin) is reluctant to trust Gollom at first, but Frodo is instantly willing for him to help them in their quest to arrive at Mordor. Gollom and Frodo have a special connection that no one else has; they were/are both ring bearers. This friendship, however, threatens the one Frodo has with Sam. Gollom is, quite simply, the greatest CG-creature in cinematic history. It's incredible how a few pixels can turn into a lovable character of whom you share emotion and pity. There are many scenes where it is obvious to the untrained eye that Gollom is computer-generated, but the fascination and interaction with the character overpowers this. In the Merry/Pippin subplot, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are trying to find them after they were captured by the fearsome Uruk-hai at the end of the last enstallment. The pursuit of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) takes Aragorn and company to Rohan, a kingdom of Viking-like horsemen. Rohan's king, Theoden (Bernard Hill), has fallen under the spell of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) through the manipulations of his adviser, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin manage to escape and seek cover in the mysterious Fanghorn Forest. While there they meet a strange a surprising army amongst the ancient trees. For me, the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli plotline was the best because of its power and strength - not only in battle scenes, but in the emotional side of things. The romance between Aragorn and Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler) has been further embellished, drawing from the trilogy's appendix. I was rather disappointed of the amount of screen time Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) has. She didn't have much in The Fellowship Of The Ring, so I was expecting more in The Two Towers - but no! The three join forces with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) (who was presumed dead at the end of The Fellowship Of The Ring) to rescue Theoden from the spell of Saruman and guide the people of Rohan to the strongholds of Helm's Deep. However, on their way to Helm's Deep they are attacked by Orcs on wargs. Aragorn and company are joined by hundreds of Rohan village people to attack and defeat an army of 10,000 Orcs. Quite possibly the most intense and awesome battle ever seen on film, it lasts for up to 45 minutes and took months to film. The scene is incredibly dark, but still manages to add the odd pinch of humour from Gimli. This fight scene is the climax to the Two Towers and is experty done.
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
Like The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers was filmed in New Zealand with its stunning scenery. With the scenery a main object of the first enstallment, The Two Towers can focus more of the love/hate/emotion side of the story - and it does, to awesome effect. Peter Jackson is definitely the ""Director of the Moment"" and rightly deserves all the praise he is recieving. The Two Towers is bound to be even more of a success than the first enstallment, which will leave you on tender hooks for the third and final enstallment - The Return Of The King. Roll on December 2003...",1040601600,2,5362,4.6691331923890065
1470896,5,B00005JKZU,"When I saw ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and realized how fantastic it was, I knew that ""The Two Towers"" was going to have a hard time beating it in scope, in talent, in visual poise and grandeur, and when I saw ""The Two Towers,"" I was absolutely blown away!  The movie litterally picks up right where ""The Fellowship"" left off.  Merry and Pippen are still held captive by the fighting Uruk-Hai, Aragorn, Gimili and Legolas are persuing them and Frodo and Sam are making their way to Mordor.  I knew the movie was going to be great in the first fifteen minutes when my favorite character from ""The Hobbit"" was introduced.  Gollum, done completely digitally (although the body movements were created by Andy Serkis, who also voices the creature) was amazing.  He is everyhting I wanted him to be and more.  Merry and Pippen come across the path of the giant tree-men, known as Ents, and the head Ent Treebeard.  These Ents provide some comic relief as well as the power needed to overhtrow Isengard.
The special effects in this film are amazing.  Much of the film enccompases Sauraman's desire to kill all humans, and his first assault on the people of Rohan and the battle to save them at Helm's Deep.  The last 45 minutes of this movie are unbelievable.  With two epic battle sequences, one at Helm's Deep and one at Isengard, Peter Jackson had his hands full with special effects.  What he accomplished in this film is far better and more advanced than anything George Lucas could ever dream of.
Another great part of this film is the fact that it is not just an action film.  The story become more emotionally engaging.  You feel strongly for the people of Rohan as the young boys prepare to go to war and you feel for Arwen and Aragorn as their love is tested and objected to.  You feel sorry for Fordo.
The movie is amazing.  The acting talent is, once again, enheralded.  Ian MacKellan is amazing once again.  Elijah Wood has an impresive turn as the emotionally unstable Frodo and Viggo Mortensen is spectacular as Aragorn.
While this movie does stray from the book a little more than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" it is still highly enjoyable.  What makes these movies so amazing is Peter Jackson.  Unlike the people who did ""Harry Potter,"" Peter Jackson took Tolkien's image of middle-earth and has created his own version.  The story remains ture, but the movie is not simply a way of retelling the book, it is a movie in its own right, and a spectacular film at that.  DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!!!",1040601600,2,2502,4.5775280898876405
1470897,5,B00005JKZU,"Pick at the flaws if you will (this movie deviates the most from the books) but Jackson's adaption of the ""Two Towers"" is an emotionally urgent, fierce, and seamless forward march in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  A word of caution, the movie begins in media res.  You get no prolouge or get put up to speed with a quick recollection of scenes from the Fellowship.
We catch up with the fractured members of the Fellowship.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Gimli (John Ryes-Davis) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are off to find and rescue the Hobbits Merry and Pippin from a band of orcs that made off with them at the end of the last film.  We also catch up with Sam (Sean Astin) and Frodo (Elijah Wood) as they try to make their way through the Rocky terrain of Emin Myul to make their way to Mordor to destroy the Ring of Power.  We also see Gollum, a wonder of CGI and masterfully voiced by Andy Serkis.  Eventually, we make our way to Rohan where Saruman (Christopher Lee) has begun his assault on the lands of men. A pawn of Saruman's has taken control of the King and put the influence of Saruman in him.  King Theoden (Bernard Hill)  is powerless on his throne.  This all can get very confusing, especially if you have not recently seen the first movie, which I strongly suggest you do.
The performances all around are charged with emotion and feeling, and the story's themes come through loud and clear.  Frodo is beginning to wain under the pressure of the Ring.  The lands of men are growing ever more weak and vulnerable to the growing might of the mordor and Isengard.  infact, the whole of middle Earth is starting to despair, now that they are faced with forces the like of which they have not seen in thousands of years.
And for those who want to see blood, guts and grand film war, Jackson delivers some of the most spectacular battle sequences ever caught on film.  Helm's Deep is one that will take your breath away.  Not to mention the opening scene of Gandalf and the Balrog and in the finale when the Ents that Merry and Pippin met in Fangorn Forest storm the walls of Isengard.  And also the scene where the soldiers of Rohan fight Isengard orcs riding ferocious beasts that Saruman had in waiting in his underground caverns.
Even with all those high standards, there are a few minor flaws.  For one, Treebeard the head Ent is hard to understand some of the time, we cannot make out what he is saying.  The next is the battle scene at Helm's Deep  goes on just a little too long before it all ends.  But one thing I would like to point out is the matter of the love story between Aragorn and Arwen.  This could have easily have ended up as filler between the film's stronger scenes but instead, we get a haunting vision of their relationship both in the past when Aragorn left Rivendell for the Fellowship and also in their future when Aragorn finally succombs to age and Arwen must live on because she is immortal.
To conclude, this is undoutably one of the best adventure/fantasy/action film in the history of movies.  There is grand specacle but it does not cover the story.  To leave you with one final word, you may have to see the movie more than once to fully appreciate it.  I am going later this week to see it one more time, and maybe again, and again, and again, and agian...",1040601600,2,3301,4.428807947019868
1470898,3,B00005JKZU,"First of all, let me preface this by saying that I loved FOTR.  I thought the editing was perfect, especially in the extended version DVD where the story flowed a little bit better.  The biggest issue for me was that the movie (the parts that were included) was pretty faithful to the book.
I will not get too specific because I don't want to spoil anyone's trip to the theatre but there were, at least, two major points in the movie where I felt incredibly let down by what was done.  Faramir, my personal favorite from the books, was diminished somewhat by his actions upon meeting Frodo (completely different from the book for no reason that I can see).  I will also only say that the people of Rohan, upon leaving Edoras, go to the wrong place.  These are only a couple of the things that were changed from the book.  Now, if changes are necessary to move the story along I can understand that...but these changes did not seem to be at all necessary and that bothered me.
But, if you're someone who is really into FX you'll definitely want to see this film.  The battle for Helm's Deep is pretty incredible, Gollum is incredible (the interaction between Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo is great), the Ents are just about how I imagined them when I was reading the books. The New Zealand scenery is stunning.
Basically, I'm only giving this 3 stars because of how far it strays from the original story...it pretty much ends up in the same place but takes a different (unfortunately, in my opinion) route in getting there.",1040601600,12,1519,4.542124542124542
1470899,2,B00005JKZU,"Visually this movie is a masterpiece. The sets, the towns, landscapes, the creatures.. everything is right out of middle earth. In this area, the film truly shines and those working on this film are to be commended for it.
I found the screenplay to leave a lot to be desired, however. Someone should tell the writers that they don't need to have a climactic moment every 10 minutes. This really killed the momentum of the movie. I was also a little disappointed at how they turned Gimli into comic relief.
Watching this film was certainly a pleasure, but I can't say that I'd do it again anytime in the near future.",1040601600,9,615,4.54954954954955
1470900,5,B00005JKZU,"I remembered well from my initial attempts at reading the ""Lord of the Rings"" at age 10 that ""The Two Towers"" was where I gave up, and hoped that Peter Jackson could work his magic at converting arguably the slowest of the Tolkien books into an epic movie. Where Jackson did a stunning job in bringing the Shire and then the individuals of the Fellowship to life in the previous movie, here I thought he had a more colossal task in front of him.  ""Towers"" lacked the whimsy of the  Bag End sequences in ""Fellowship"", replacing the fun Hobbits with stilted dialogue between anonymous human soldiers. I shouldn't have worried, of course.
There are three areas in which ""The Two Towers"" excels as a storytelling achievement.
The Story: Jackson and three other scriptwriters depart from their ""Fellowship"" path by taking real liberties with the Tolkien novel. The book that's come to be known as ""Towers"" -- really the middle two ""books"" of ""Lord of the Rings"" -- suffers in that Frodo, Sam and the Ring do not appear until the second half. The movie amends that by redividing its structure equally between Frodo/Sam, Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, and Merry/Pippin, the three surviving branches of the Fellowship. Considerable more time is spent, of course, on the epic battle at Helm's Deep, in which Aragorn proves his nascent leadership skills to the evolving race of Man. Frodo for his part takes an unexpected detour amonst men, as the character of Faramir (whose brother perished in the last film) becomes far more obsessed by the lure of the Rings than he did in the book. Jackson takes us through the bombardment of Osgiliath -- only alluded to in the book -- and thus allows Sam Gamgee's heroism to be proven at a critical moment.
This is important because of what the ""Two Towers"" movie doesn't include: a substantial slice of the action from the novel.  You won't get to see the Palantir hurled from the ruins of Saruman's tower, and, most importantly, Frodo, Sam and Gollum do not cross over into Mordor. Jackson & co. deferred a lot of the plot of ""Towers"" for the final movie, but they've expanded what's left into a seamless, structurally intact, movie of its own.
Helm's Deep: The previous gold standard in movie battle sequences was ""Barry Lyndon"". A line of soldiers in period costume marching shoulder to shoulder along the length of 70mm film, to the fife and drum strains of ""The British Grenadiers"", is going to be hard to top. Jackson, rather than hire 10,000 extras wearing grotesque latex masks, used sophisticated software to simulate large chunks of the battle, while the most important moments are achieved by close-up shots of actors and stuntmen (a far more satisfying balance than achieved in the almost entirely-digital fights of ""Spider-Man""). The battle at Helm's Deep runs about an hour and sustains interest throughout. The tone of the battle progresses from fearful to dim to triumphan, as a long-missing character rides in to save the day with second digital army.
The Digital Spectacle: Let's face it, computerized graphic imaging (CGI) can seem a tremendous step backwards in special effects at times. The Jar Jar Binks presence in the first ""Star Wars"" prequel was about as convincingly integrated into the film as were the cartoon characters in 1947's ""Song of the South"". Spider-Man's recent efforts flight resembled nothing so much as Mighty Mouse. Here, Jackson has taken a tremendous leap forward by turning Gollum into a Ray Harryhausen effect: Gollum appears on screen all spidery, herky-jerky, more like the stop-motion Beast from 20,000 Fathoms than how you might expect a thousand year-old hobbit to actually move.  Which isn't bad -- this proves that the concept of ""digital actors"" is getting easier to realize, month by month.  And the Gollum design is absolutely grotesque and far more imaginative than could have been attained by a man in a rubber mask.
The real triumph of the film is Treebeard. A bizarre plot point in ""Lord of the Rings"" is here wonderfully rendered in terrific CGI. The plot point (just a chapter or two in the book) is dragged out across the whole of the film's three hours, as the Ents slowly uproot themselves into action, but the script alters the structure of the Ents sequence and thus allows for a more visually compelling conclusion.
The lesson of ""Two Towers"" is that less is not always more. Jackson shows what Tolkien only alludes to on the printed page, and restructures the script so that a three-hour movie seems as effortless and fun to watch as something half the length.  This will be a film to see at least twice in the theater, and repeatedly on DVD late next year.",1040515200,,4650,4.8501259445843825
1470901,5,B00005JKZU,"Wow! I'm tempted to say that The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the BEST film I've ever seen. I won't go that far just yet. I'll have to see if it stands the test of time like my other fave flicks; For now, I'll just say that Two Towers is the best film of the year.
  The Two Towers hits the ground running; There's no recap of The Fellowship, and the audience is instantly thrown into the thick of things, starting with Gandalf's struggle against The Balrog. We follow Frodo and Sam on their trek to Mount Doom, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli as they track the Uruk-Hai that have abducted Merry and Pippin, and get our first glimpses of Gollum and Treebeard. The acting and effects are first-rate, especially Gollum, a computer-animated character voiced/portrayed by Andy Serkis. He's cute in an ugly kinda way, and the effects combine with Serkis' amazing performance to generate a sympathy for the character that none of the animated Tolkien tales ever managed to do. I don't know if Serkis is eligible for an Oscar, but he should be. The scene where Gollum argues with himself is heart-rending. The Two Towers also contains the biggest battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie- There were times when the audience would just collectively gasp at the sheer size of the armies. Amazing stuff! We've all seen effects-driven films before though; What sets The Lord of the Rings apart are the characters. You truly grow to care about them over the course of the films, something I can't really say about too many other Fantasy/Sci-Fi films lately (Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clones...).
  Ok, so that's what's good. What's bad is the Year-long wait until The Return of the King! I don't know about you, but it's not often I sit through a three-hour long film and start feeling sad when I know it's about to end! I just wanted it to keep going! Director Peter Jackson has done yet another wonderful job, and I can't wait to get the DVD.",1040515200,,1938,4.560344827586207
1470902,3,B00005JKZU,"My review might have to be taken with a grain of salt, since I'm not a Tolkein fan, the only book I've read is The Hobbit, and I didn't even see the last movie.  Even for someone in my position though this movie is kind of fun.  It starts off with a bang, the movie goes straight into the action, and we follow several threads of adventurers all seeking the same ends, to save Middle Earth, the world of men, and destroy the ring Frodo wears about his neck.  The movie is three quarters special effects, but they're nicely done, it's a little like watching a Disney movie with human actors.  The epic itself is rousing.  The bad guys, the orcs are truly disgusting.  The ents, walking and talking trees, are rather slow and frustrating, but they're supposed to be that way.  And they are engaging.  The loves of Aragorn, elf and human, add a little romance to the story.  And the climactic battle scenes are amusing as long as you don't think about them too much.  The best character, however, is Gollum (aka Smiegel?) a washed out villain with a conscience who must debate his every move with himself.  Apparently he's entirely computer graphics, but he steals the  show.  He's a kind of anti-Yoda.",1040515200,2,1199,4.52093023255814
1470903,4,B00005JKZU,"I wanted to be one of the first people to give this flick a rave after having seen it.  ""Towers"" is not faultless - even next to ""Fellowship"", but it's still a great flick, very much the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy.  The film opens with Gandalf's climactic battle against the Balrog in the depths of the Dwarves's kingdom of Moria, setting us up for the return of the wizard who we all thought lost.  The over-all story concerns the efforts of a group of rabbit-like people called Hobbits to destroy the ""One Ring"" of power sought by the evil Sauron.  Should Sauron reclaim it, he will become powerful enough to return the world to shadow.  The only way to destroy the ring is to toss it into the fiery chasm of ""Mount Doom"", a seething volcano in the dark land of Mordor - itself Sauron's home (the ring is otherwise indestructible).  The first film had the Hobbit Frodo and his friends form a ""fellowship"" with Gimli (a bellicose dwarf), Legolas (an elvish archer whose quiver never empties of arrows and whose aim is always true), Boromir (a human and thus more prone than most to the ring) Aragorn (played by Viggo Mortensen; Aragorn is also human but seems immune from the temptations of the ring out of duty - his great ancestor was seduced by its power and Aragorn's doubts keep him honest) and the sage wizard Gandalf (Ian Kckellen buried under piles of hair and speaking in a delicious accent that seems similarly weighted).  The band must contend, not only with the forces of Mordor, but also those of Isengard - a human realm led by the once wise now corrupt Saruman the White.  With nothing but hope to stand in the way of Mordor (in ""Middle Earth"", magic is common while ""hope"" is considered the stuff of fantasy) Saruman throws his lot in with Sauron - his fortress in Isengarde and Sauron's looming citadel at Barad-Dur being the two towers of the title.  If the Rings trilogy is meant as a metaphor for pre-WWII Europe, Mordor would be Nazi Germany while Saruman would approximate Marshal Petain and Il-Duce, the Quislings, Fifth Columnists and collaborators of every stripe; scenes of Saruman addressing huge columns of Orc troops look reminiscent of the Nazi rallies of 1938.
""Fellowship"" ended with the band fracturing.  The Hobbits Merry and Pippin (the first movie's comic relief) are captured by orcs.  Frodo and Sam, eager to prevent any more of their friends from suffering, proceed onto Mordor alone.  The remaining band swear to rescue the Hobbits.  Gollum, a wretched hobbit-like creature who bore the ring for 500 years (the ring gave him long life, but time has not been kind to his body or soul) appeared briefly in the first movie, but now comes face-to-face with our heroes.  Sam would as soon be rid of Gollum, but Frodo pities him - both because of Gandalf's wise words in the first movie, but more practically because Gollum will prove useful for navigating the dark lands of Mordor.  Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas are side-tracked in their search for Merry and Pippin when they miraculously reunite with Gandalf and go to join to the defense of Rohan - a human kingdom facing massacre from Saruman's army. Rohan's king leads his people to a mountain redoubt called ""Helm's Deep"" - carved out of the mountains, it's apparently impregnable, the only defense they have against Saruman's orcs.  Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin meet up with the enchanted inhabitants of a living forest - CGI trees who learn to their horror that Saruman has uprooted the forests of Isengarde to feed the fires that forged his army.
So, is it great?  Yeah - it suffers in comparison to the first movie, though that's because ""Fellowship"" was able to focus on that one group rather than dividing itself among several as ""Towers"" requires.  The new flick fits seamlessly with the first, though making it harder to follow for non-fanatics who didn't catch ""Fellowship"" (which began with a monolog by the Elvish Queen Galadriel that synopsizes the ring lore, and then reinforces it through the perspectives of the elvish King Elrond and the nagging doubts of Aragorn; the new film doesn't deal with the legend at all, keeping its business to the story at hand - the ring itself becomes less an object than an idea or metaphor, a ""mcguffin"" like that suitcase in ""Pulp Fiction"").  If the story is harder to follow, it stays true to the first film's focus on the trials and loyalty of its characters.  If the flick gets more jokes at the expense of the dwarf Gimli, it also reminds you that he's the guy you want fighting on your side when the Orcs strike your neighborhood - something you'd never say about Jar-Jar.  Aragorn is less remote than he was in the first flick - though Gandalf becomes more aloof, the result of his life-altering battle with the Balrog.  The change implies that he's less of the approachable character in ""Fellowship"" - and only highlights the cursory treatment of that epic deathmatch.  ""Towers"" draws strength from two sources - the epic battle for Helm's Deep and the tortured character of Gollum.  Though both dependent on cutting-edge CGI, the flick works wonders with each: the battle is fought by hordes yet not the faceless hordes of ""Attack of the Clones""; Gollum is a CGI wonder, tortured not only by his endless wasted life, but by conflicting emotions brought to life in one scene that unintentionally reminds of Ren from ""Ren and Stimpy"", but shows the very convincing depths of his dark soul.  At over three hours long, this movie doesn't waste a minute.",1040515200,,5505,4.73326359832636
1470994,4,B00005JKZU,"I just saw this movie yesterday and decided to writer a review on it. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues where the first one left off, the Fellowship is broken and now they continue different ways. Frodo and Sam are making their way towards Mordor to try to get rid of the ring. Mary and Pippin have been captured by a band of Urak-Hai, Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn from where they left off from the last movie are going to try to rescue Mary and Pippin.
Now not already known from the LAST movie.
When seeing the two towers I was often breathtaken by it but...It lacked when compared to the first movie. It seems as if the ""Chemistry"" between the actors was not there. There were glimpses  of it, such as when Frodo and Sam ask if people will write stories about them later on, it felt just like it used to, the relationship between each other. Probably the main reason was that much of the movie was made on blue screen. Another thing that made me slightly angry was that they completely ... up Faramir. In the movie he seemed FAR too much like Boramir. I think they took too much liberty when writing the script because they completely messed up how he found out about the ring and how he treated them. In the book he treated them as guests, but still prisoners, but he treated them with respect. Eventually he gets curious and asks them what they were doing there, and they get into a verbal sparring match that lasts for hours, and eventually Sam finds lets it out. Later on even though it's against the laws of his people he lets them go from the Hide Out.
But...In the movie he treats them as prisoners yes, but it seems just as prisoners. There wasn't the respect that he had in the book. He finds out about the ring from Gollum in the movie. Big ""no no"". And then he takes them to (I've gone blank) ""The City"", again, in the book they never visit it, which kind of screws up the plot line.
There were many good things though. The Ents were PERFECT! ""We have decided that you are not orcs. Gollum was just plain amazing, the anamation AND the voice. The battle of helms deep sucked you right in, and Frodo saying that he believes Smeegle (Gollum) can come back was just heartwarming.
Except for the bad points mentioned above, very good.

1470995,5,B00005JKZU,"Congratulations to Peter Jackson and all of his associates for bringing Tolkien's work to silver screen in all its glory!  One obvious telltale to how successful this movie is the fact that over this weekend, one could not simply go to the movie theater and get tickets for the next show.  The lines for this silver screen masterpiece were to say the least, amazing.  The Two Towers and its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring are what movie going is all about!  Hopefully, the producers will follow the same pattern they set with the first movie and put the DVD for the theatrical release out in May and the extended version next November.
The premise:
The Two Towers opens with what can only be described as an utterly astonishing sequence of the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog.  As is revealed at the end of the previous movie, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trailing the Oraki who have captured Merry and Pippin, taking them to Saruman.  Frodo and Sam are on their own quest, attempting to take the ""one ring"" to Mordor for its destruction.  Along the way they have Gollum to deal with.  The movie builds up to the battle of Helms Deep.  The Battle of Helms Deeps makes the epic battle scenes of other popular movies over the last few years pale in comparison.
If you have to wait in line or purchase advance tickets for this movie, it is absolutely worth the wait.  Now we've only a year to wait for the conclusion to this masterpiece in The Return of the King.  {ssintrepid}",1040515200,2,1491,4.567669172932331
1470996,2,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers had fantastic cinematography and effects, just like the first; however, it seriously deviates from the book. Now I know that a movie can't follow any book exactly and I was impressed with how 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was amazingly close to the book. But the Two Towers takes some of the most key events, characters, and relationships and totally changes them around. The first movie did not.
Great action... I think parts would be hard to follow for someone who hasn't read the books. There were some serious director liberties taken in this movie... many, many more than the previous. Some major events resembled the book. Others were totally changed and made less effective. Readers of the books who liked the first movie will be seriously disappointed with this movie. Too bad. :(.",1040428800,11,804,4.875912408759124
1470997,5,B00005JKZU,Peter Jackson has done it again! He has outdone himself on the Two Towers. This is a must see movie especially if you followed The Fellowship of the Ring. I am a big fan of the books and I must admit that Jackson tries to stay as true to the books as possible. Who knew that Gimli the dwarf was a comediene? How about Gollum and his split personality? The closer he gets to Mordor the weirder Frodo gets. And Sam? well he is  just Sam. Treebeard was quite a spectacle too. Merry and Pippin really got his ire up showing him the trees sauruman destroyed. I would recomend this movie to anyone. My best friend's 8 year old son went with us and he loved it and kept up with it. Go see it you will love it too.,1040428800,,706,4.042857142857143
1470998,5,B00005JKZU,"That basically much sums up ""The Two Towers"", which is the next chapter in J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy novel, as well as director, Peter Jackson's, film version.
PLOT SUMMARY: This chapter, contrasted to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", is a much darker, more twisted, and evil chapter. The film follows three main subplots: Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee's (Sean Astin) journey through Mordor to Mount Doom; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas's (Orlando Bloom) hunt for the Orcs, which later into the story, turns into a huge battle; and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin's (Billy Boyd) escape from the Orcs and meeting a giant-talking tree, Treebread (also voiced by John Rhys-Davies). Saruman the White (Christopher Lee) has turned more evil and powerful, and wants nothing more than the Ring, which of course, is what Frodo has. He creates an evil army set out to destroy all the men of Middle-Earth. Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) has also returned, and sets out to help Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Aragorn believes the three should help the people of Middle-Earth. When they sought out Theoden, King of Rohan (Bernard Hill), Aragorn urges the old king to persue war against the Ugluk, Saruman's followers, even though there are not enough men left to fight. The Ugluk are getting closer to the castle where the people are staying, and there's no stopping them. So King Theoden finally agrees, and a huge battle begins. Also, while all this is going on, Aragorn is introduced to Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who is Theoden's daughter. Aragorn and Eowyn are attracted to each other, but Aragorn tries to keep his promise to Arwen (Liv Tyler), who has decided to go and help her people, after a lecture from her father, Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), about sacraficing her life to become mortal. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam seem to be lost finding their way to Mordor. No sooner can you say, ""my precious"", than are they encountered by Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), who has been following them all this time, attracted to the Ring. Sam notices that Frodo has been starting to fall under the evil spell of the Ring, and tries to keep Frodo grounded, especially after Frodo takes the risk of letting Gollum guide them to the gates of Mordor. The final subplot consists of Merry and Pippin, who manage to escape the Orcs after they are attacked by a group of men. They escape into the dark forest, and come across a talking and moving tree, called Treebread. Treebread is from a species known as the Ents, and as he carries them through the forest, Treebread mentions that there are not many Ents left, for Saruman's slaves have been cutting them down. Merry and Pippin at first want to go home back to the Shire, but then they realize that if they don't go and help their companions, then the Shire may be no more when they get there. So they end up persuing Treebread and the rest of the Ents to fight Saruman, which starts a battle all on it's own.
OVERALL THOUGHTS: Unlike ""The Fellowship"", ""The Two Towers"" has more complex plots, which can be confusing if you haven't seen the first film, and they do not go into detail about how the Ring became an evil source of power, also like they did in the first one. I guess Peter Jackson expects that most of the people who go to see ""The Two Towers"" have either already read the books, or have at least seen ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". The acting is quite superb, more so in this one than in the first. The chemistry between the actors is much stronger, and the dialouge is better. The special effects and the CG Gollum are absolutely amazing! The battle sequences are exceptional, visually intense and stunning. There is not as much humor or character development in this chapter, but this chapter was more about the battles and the power of the Ring. Peter Jackson is a true genius, but you cannot give him all of the credit. J.R.R. Tolkien was also a true genius, for creating such a breathtaking story. Even the love triangle between Aragorn, Arwen, and Eowyn was interesting, and didn't take up too much time, either. We only get to see Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) towards the end as she is talking through Elrond's mind. So Blanchett has more of a cameo role.
People also might get a little confused since there is no real beginning and no real ending, but most people can soon forgive it...and it makes you eager for the final chapter, ""The Return of the King"", due out in theaters next Christmas in 2003.
""The Fellowship of the Ring"" begins it...""The Two Towers"" continues it...and ""The Return of the King"" concludes it. It's
""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy!
I highly recommend ""The Two Towers"".

1470999,5,B00005JKZU,"Be prepared to be greatly entertained even if you flunked LoTR 101. The story progresses with the Ring still in the custody of Frodo(E.Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin).
 There are two new 'little people,' Merry and Pippin, who spend most of their time riding on the backs of beasts or on the limbs of a tree. You will like them and I did not mind the trees either, they were quite entertaining and essential for the start of the disembowelment of the black power under Saruman The White. Purists will say the Director took liberties on interpreting the Books an I say good on the Director as there were a lot of numbing dialog in the book, that is not in the picture.
All and I do mean all of the cast were there and 100% with the movie. They are to be commended for their togetherness and long hard months making this movie of the century. Kudos for all of you! And for entertaining us with a well thought of story.
You will marvel at the cinematography and especially the breathtaking beauty of New Zealand, what a masterpiece of scenery. The sets were not to be believed, they were so perfect, Down to the last stone in the Castle tower.
The love between Aragorn (Viggo M.) and Arwen, (Liv T.) is a sweet never ending
affair that exudes their admiration for each other.
Mckeller, as (Gandolph The White) does a great job for his part to destroy Saruman The White. The scene of him calling his great white steed and then riding him, no saddle or bridle will amaze you.
Now for the part I thought was the most realistic of the creatures of LoTR and that is 'precious, precious,' Gollum, a Smeagol, an ancient relative of the Hobbits. Andy Serkis does all the crawling around over the rocks and chasing the fish in the stream and the Animators fill in Gollum, and there is no time when you will not think that precious, precious, Gollum is anything but, real and alive. Even on the very close-ups of his face, absolutely amazing. If for no other reason Gollum is worth the trip and money to see this amazing film.
But you will have 10,000 reasons to go see this movie and an empty spot in your psyche if you do not...I want to mention Orlando Bloom who has quite a big part in this movie and as young as he is he carried himself well, also, Karl Urban as Eomer did a brief but great job.",1040428800,,2281,4.34192037470726
1471000,5,B00005JKZU,"I don't think trailer reviews should be written. Anyway, I just saw the Two Towers and it was defenitly better than the Fellowship. And Thats hard to do. It did totally fool aroud with the story, however. Faramir never wanted to posses the ring, and he never took Frodo and Sam to Osgalith in the book. The scene with Osgalith was the only dissapointing part. I especialy liked Gandalf going toe-to-toe with the Balroq on Zirak-Zigal. LOTR trivia: Gandalf's sword Glamdring was once held by Turgon king of Gondolin. The film ends at least four chapters before the book does, but I think this is to compinsate for th Return of the King's length. That book is shorter than the first Harry Potter(ugh, I hate HP). That probably mean's Jackson has cut out the Souring of the Shire. Oh well, you can't have everything in life.

While it is without a doubt some of the best cinematography ever, it was really nothing more than a war film and basically ""Braveheart"" with elves.  It is 100% unadulterated testosterone.  The two female characters in the film are ""fluff"" and do exactly as they are told.  Not to mention that I had a huge cramp in my back after sitting watching battle scene after battle scene for three hours.  To the other reviewers, no one cares whether you liked the trailer or not, that's the gimmick to get you to spend your money on the film.  Don't you get it?  It's an advertisement and those are always suppose to make the product look good even if it is a piece of trash.

1471002,4,B00005JKZU,"Well some of you aren't going to want to read this but,the movie was only 4 stars. The action great, CG was great, following the plot of the book not so great. Now I'm not one of these nerds who think it has to be word for word like the book but some of the scenes were way off. The Treebeard scene was one of the lesser ones  but still off(Why can't they just agree to a war what was the point of having to be tricked?)Also Aragon falling off the cliff? What was the point of that(Why couldn't he just ride to Helms Deep with the others?) And finally, the one and only thing that really upset me was the next to last scene Faramir and Frodo. Faramir Bad?? What happened to I wouldn't pick it up if it was on the highway and the walls of Gondor were falling(or something like that)? Now it's tell the king I have a most powerful gift for him(traitor). Peter Jackson really let the book readers down on this one I think. Now my mom may not mind but for someone who has read the book this is to big of a director's change. Leaving something out is one thing but changing the story is another. All in all this is a great middle movie to the series. Just read the book before you go. Smeagol is the best CG creature ever(Star What!!!)Don't be fooled though this isn't a movie it is the continuation of the first one. You jump right in and take off till you once again hit a sudden stop no looking back. Well once again the long wait till the DVD comes out.

1471003,3,B00005JKZU,"I loved the Fellowship of the Ring movie, and was eagerly awaiting the Two Towers.  Although a devoted Tolkien reader (generally re-reading LOTR once a year), I don't consider myself a ""purist"", and was willing to forgive Fellowship for it's deviations from the story because it kept within the spirit of Tolkien, as well as being necessary to adapt to a much shorter medium than the books.
However, I was deeply disappointed by the deviations The Two Towers movie made from the book - deviations which I felt fundamentally altered many of the characters involved.  Example #1 is Faramir - his whole character is altered by his stout resolution to take Frodo to Gondor.  The whole contrast between Boromir and Faramir is now completely lost. The scene takes up valuable minutes that could be spent on something else, and far from adding to the story, seriously detracts.
Also disappointing is the healing of Theoden, and his subsequent recovery.  In the books, Gandalfs healing powers are 10% magic, and 90% wisdom.  The movie completely reverses this relationship, making the healing a simple magical duel between Gandalf and Saruman.  In Tolkien, Wizards accomplish their greatest feats through their extensive knowledge and lore.  Changing this to magic feels like a cheat.  Also, after being freed from his affliction, Thoeden seems to show very little willingness to accept the advice of Gandalf, another serious departure from the books which seems pointless.
Third major variation I was disappointed with was the Entmoot.  The Ents make decisions very slowly.  To show them deciding not to help, and then flipping about on a moments notice when Treebeard sees what he should have known all along seems bizarre in the extreme.
I also had a problem with the treatment of Gimli.  The comic relief added to Fellowship was fun, and added to the story.  In the Two Towers, however, the comic relief seemed to consist of making Gimli into a buffoon, something not at all keeping in character with the story.
I thought the added scene depicting an attack on Theoden and his people was O.K., and added some extra action, but the fall of Aragorn seemed a pointless excursion.
A minor quibble- Gollum was not visually not at all as I imagined him, but I recognize that everyone will have their own opinion of what he should look like.  But really, he didn't look nearly as wizened as one would expect after 500 years of being stretched and tormented by the ring.  Clean him up and fix his teeth and he would look like a healthy hobbit, not a creature barely recognizable as one.
I was also deeply disappointed that the two best scenes from Two Towers were removed - the confrontation with Saruman, and the fight with Shelob.  But since these seem to be simply moved to ROTK, that doesn't detract from the series as a whole, I suppose.
Two Towers remains competently executed, and the actors do an excellent job portraying the parts they were given.  I simply have serious problems with the scriptwriter.  Overall, Peter Jackson has used up most of the good will from me that he earned in Fellowship of the Ring.  I'll be watching Return of the King, but praying it resembles Fellowship more than Towers.",1040428800,14,3199,4.8385321100917436
1471084,2,B00005JKZU,"Anyone who has read the book will be likely to find this film to be jarring.  If Peter Jackson is such a Tolkien fan, why does he find it necessary to make so many gratuitous changes?  My personal unfavorite is the new character Faramir who Jackson wrote in.  By a strange coincidence, Tolkien also had a character by the same name in his book.  I am not a purist,and loved the Fellowship despite its changes, but this time the spirit of the book has been trampled and I really don't care if I am the only person in the known universe who thinks so.",1040428800,13,549,4.25
1471085,5,B00005JKZU,"Being a movie fan who has never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this movie or not.  I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.
As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie.  All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately.  If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.
From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile.  While there are plenty of keen fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deeper character development, especially since all the characters had been introduced in the first movie.  There are also plenty of special effects, but they are blended into the movie and advanec the story, they don't create a sense of showing off.
[possible spoilers here]
Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual.  Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one.  He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy.  The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film.  And of course, there is Golum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.
In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie.  It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the ""Star Wars"" of this generation.  Peter Jackson's second Lord of the Rings movie is an excellent show and a movie that will be famous years from now.",1040428800,3,2091,4.391191709844559
1471086,5,B00005JKZU,"The question of how do you follow up one of the best fantasy movies ever made, has finally been resolved by Peter Jackson: you take things to another level, another scale.  And that's precisely what he's done with The Two Towers, the middle part of his Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It begins pretty much where the last film left off, with Frodo and Sam in search of Mordor, Pippin and Merry hobbit-napped by orcs and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on their way to rescue them.
Any review of this movie is probably going to be separated into two parts to some extent.  One is to whether Two Towers works as a film and secondly as to whether it's a good adaptation of Tolkien's novel.  The answer to both is a defiant yes, despite sometimes veering from the original narrative.  Visually this is amazing, making glorious use of the New Zealand landscape, and manages to stage some thrilling battle sequences, in particular the long but not over-extended fight for Helm's Deep that proves the movie's finale.  However, though Helm's Deep has often been the focus of many a review, the stunning fights along the way - notably Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, and a group of Orcs arriving on a pack of hyena-like creatures.  There's also the creation of Gollum, most definitely the most impressive digital creation for the cinema to date.  Although much credit is due to the actor who plays him, the digital creation of Gollum's split persona is superbly realised, managing to mould a creature that is both grotesque and pitiable.  The acting is again solid as ever.  Indeed, the cast is almost entirely made up of rising stars, and Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler and Viggo Mortensen hold their own alongside acting greats Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill.  All of the characters here have such screen presence that they really pull you into this beautifully realised fantasy world.  Of course, such words as 'beautifully' and 'superbly' seem like hyperbole but to anyone who's seen the movie they're the only words that seem fit somehow.
Now as to how Peter Jackson, a self-confessed Tolkien fanatic, deals with the book.  He does it incredibly well, although the various deviances from Tolkien's work may infuriate some purists.  Yet for the most part such deviances are entirely necessary and help to make the story even more cinematic and involving than it already was.  The book is actually split into two parts, telling the tale of Frodo and Sam after telling of what happened to the other characters.  As an interesting sidenote, the battle of Helm's Deep actually happens halfway through rather than at the end.  Jackson adds much more Eowyn and Arwen (who isn't in the book) to the action, although incidentally the romantic subplot of Aragorn and Arwen is in Tolkien's appendix to the third book Return of the King.  The addition of more screen time for the female characters was a wise choice, since this was arguably the only thing wrong with the book was its homogenous environment.  There's also the addition of Frodo's empathy for Gollum, and his argument with Sam over this provides one of the movie's most compelling moments.  Also the recreation of the Ents and the Nazgul are very well done indeed, showing Jackson's attention to detail.
At three hours in length many people have complained that's it's boring, but something this accomplished that has character development alongside the action sequences, drawing an audience of adults and kids alike.  My one point of possible criticism is that this might be a bit menacing for younger children, although other than that this is proof positive that Jackson is a director of his generation.  Miss this at your peril!",1040428800,,3682,4.86698717948718
1471087,4,B00005JKZU,"The movie was fantastic, but so much happened that some of the characters were barely in it, like Gandalf, Eomer and Faramir.  This film was three hours long, but still needed to be longer to add a bit of depth of character to some of the people in it.  Perhaps I'll be a bit more satisfied if they put out an extended version on DVD.
The battle scenes were truly breathtaking; I sat there slack-jawed, staring at what the director Peter Jackson has achieved with this series of films.
But there were certain things not in this film that were in the books, that I really wanted to see, most notably, Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman after the battle of Helm's Deep.  There were a few scenes with Arwen to make the film not so male-oriented, and I thought they could easily have been dispensed with so that we could spend a little time getting to know some of the newer characters.  Eomer in particular was in the film for not much more than 60 seconds, and I thought he needed some fleshing out.
However, all in all, Jackson has raised the bar on film making once again with this film.  Gollum was the first computer generated character I've ever seen that I actually liked, and in fact he was quite a scene-stealer.  The film was a wonderful effort all around.",1040428800,,1265,4.478260869565218
1471088,5,B00005JKZU,"For those who have read, re-read and re-re-read the Lord of The Rings, the new Peter Jackson film, the Two Towers, is a big departure from what we've imagined while reading the book.  That doesn't lessen the visual impact, the cinemagraphic sweep, or the awe inspiring size and scope of the film.  The battle scenes alone are enough to make the ghost of Cecil B.(10 Commandments) DeMille drool with envy.
It does mean that you shouldn't go into the movie expecting to see the story followed as closely as it was in Fellowship (yes, it also departed from the written story, but not as much as Towers).
Although Mr, Jackson took quite a bit of artistic license with this film, enough of the original story is woven in to satisfy the most ardent fan of the book.  In fact, there are long stretches that are taken practically verbatim from Tolkien's work.
The only major annoyance?  Gimli's role dwarfed (sorry) by the desire to have him be the comic relief.
All in all, Towers is at least as good, if not better than Fellowship.",1040428800,,1025,4.584699453551913
1471089,3,B00005JKZU,"Ive noticed that most of the reviews currently are based on the ""preview"" (mostly 5 stars). I too liked the ""preview"", and it looked very interesting.
BUT, when i went to go see it it was not that interesting.
I have not read the book, but then again i did not read the book for the first movie (fellowship) and enjoyed that one. But this one was three hours of what i would like to call a ""buffer"".
They did a very odd thing, which I could not follow. It seemed as though they had three (yes three) movies going at once. This really confused me, and by doing so might have took away from the movies story line. Now, I don't know if they did this in the book, but as a viewer I would have liked to see it progressing though time, not just little cuts.  After the movie, i found out that there were two other hobbits, which i thought were just another storyline of frodo.  This is what triped me up, and as a viewer, I did not pick up on this because they looked so much alike.
Also, even at the biggest war scene yet, it wasn't top notch. The computer graphics (cg) were good though, and kept that feeling of realism that could only be acomplished by computers.
The music of the movie was very appropiate, and fit in perfectly as this epic battle unfolds.
I think this is really ment to lead up to the third movie, and i'm hoping the third is much better.
They did a good job with golem, and like the book he was a major character in the movie.
To sum it up. The Trailer seems alot more interesting then the movie really is. And the movie had a very confusing sort of style to it, which I myself did not like. If you are a true fan though, you just have to see this, but don't expect it to be like the first movie.
Lastly, I think if I had read the book, it would have made a lot more sense and would have been better.

1471195,4,B00005JKZU,"Im finding it a bit difficult to assess this movie overall after just one viewing, as it felt so distinct from the book. Whereas _Fellowship_ corresponded in a linear manner with the events portrayed in the book, and so felt at once familiar as well as visually new and bracing, the disparate nature of the plot lines in _The Two Towers_ seemed to give the filmmakers a lot of jostling room to monkey with the source material. And while that at times worked during the course of the film, it didn't always feel comfortable to me.
 Im pretty sure Ill like it better the second time through, as that was the case with _Fellowship_. Unfortunately, that probably means that given the opportunity of repeated absorbings, the immediacy of the film increasingly supplants the book version that was fresh in my mind (Im wondering how _Fellowship_ the book will seem once Ive gone back and read it; I haven't since the movie came out last year). I haven't figured how that dichotomy is going to resolve itself over time, or even if it is.
Anyway, back to the movie, and some random thoughts about it. As with _Fellowship_, there were numerous instances of attention to detail that I really liked and appreciated, such as Eomers Rohirrim surrounding the Three Hunters in perfect formation, Southrons marching into the Black Gate, Theoden and the simbelmyn flowers on the burial mounds, Herbs and Stewed Rabbit, Oliphaunts, ""Forth Eorlingas!"", and many lines of dialogue lifted right from the pages of Tolkien, even Faramirs initial confrontation with Frodo and Sam (although their interaction diverges from the book radically after that).
The Arwen/Elrond flashbacks and interludes I thought worked fine, and I didn't mind the whole Warg attack episode either (we didn't get to see the one in _Fellowship_, after all). I heard several weeks in advance about the Elves participation in Helms Deep, and thought ""thats messed up,"" but now I don't mind it so much. It makes sense to me now. Unfortunately, the brief scenes with Treebeard and the Ents did not conjure up a scintilla of the sense of enchantment and wonder which the book does for me, but at least they're there. A few of Treebeards lines are pretty good, though (""hooommm, that doesnt make much sense to me but you *are* very *small*""), and I did enjoy seeing Isengard getting WORKED! Hah!
One tendency I notice in these movies is for certain details or hints in the book to get picked up and made into a *spectacle*, like the wizard-duel in _Fellowship_, and the transformation of Theoden in _The Two Towers_, in which a vague metaphor in the book is played out like nothing so much as an *exorcism* on screen (complete with a view of Sarumans control being physically wrested away). Seemed weird, and perhaps a little excessive. Probably one of those book-to-film things where important subtleties get made really obvious. Oh, well. Thats why we have books.
I must confess I was a bit underwhelmed with Helms Deep. One of the many things that really grabbed me about _Fellowship_ was the incredibly *kinetic* way the battle scenes were filmed, of which I had never seen the likes before, and I was expecting to see that same sort of thing on a much larger scale at Helms Deep (all the more because advance reports used all manner of hyperbole like ""mind-blowing"" to describe it). And a lot of the hand-to-hand stuff just seemed dizzying and a bit incoherent, although some cool stuff shows up when the camera backs up a bit from the action, like all the Uruk-Hais war machines, and the physical setting of Helms Deep itself, which is certainly impressive. And where Legolass single-screen-shot one-two-three move in _Fellowship_ dropped my jaw to the floor, his little shield-surfing bit here only drew a ""yeah-sure"" smirk from me.
And now to Gollum. The rendering of his character by Andy Serkis is as finely nuanced as the CGI on the screen is. Jackson and co., to their credit, fully realized how important it was to make Gollum *work*. The truth is, hes not much more fun to be around on screen than he would be in person, and I think the reason for that is that he *does* come across like hes supposed to: a tortured junkie in withdrawal, consumed with insatiable want and loathing. The only potential problem, maybe, was the unintentional(?) laughs Gollum generated in the audience in some key scenes. Wood and Astins performances of Frodo and Sam are adequate, as they were in the first film.
Sadly, the perceptive, intuitive, but strong-willed Faramir of the books has been all but replaced, and the guy in the movie trying to pass himself off as Faramir is none too compelling even in the capacity he serves there. I heard that either Philippa Boyens or Fran Walsh said that the Faramir of the books was rather static and wouldnt translate well filmically, and thats as may be, but what they did do with Faramir didn't work so well for me. How will they make him likeable enough in _Return of the King_ that Eowyn will take him?
The whole Osgiliath thing where Frodo almost gives the Ring up to the Nazgul, and Faramir is somehow able to discourage it with a single arrow, I didn't buy it. As people have already pointed out, wouldnt Sauron have bent all his resources to capturing the Ring once one of the Nazgul located it? Doesnt make sense to me.
In summary, I certainly admire the scope of the effort, the obvious reverence of the filmmakers for the source material, and all the little loving details that do work like they're supposed to. I think thats all I have to say about it until a second viewing",1040342400,,5570,4.730452674897119
1471196,5,B00005JKZU,"This is ""storytelling"" and ""storyseeing"" of the highest order. We were all blown away by Part I and left the theater asking how Parts II and III could measure up. Would there be a let down? Was all the budget used up on Part I? (They had to know we would all go see Part II anyway.) Well, Part II answers those questions. If anything, this movie is more satisfying, more detailed and more expensive than the first and the perfect set up for the final part of the Trilogy.
The action is intense and unrelenting, making room for digital effects to be a part of almost every scene, but nothing gets in the way of the tale.  The care and detail show up everywhere. When the digital effects start flowing in the battles, focus now and then on the corners of the screen. There are even small subplots of action there.
You literally could not have made this movie five years ago--unless you would have settled for a Gollum puppet or some man in a Gollum costume. The poor creature is done just about perfectly and actually looks the best in the close up shots. Here, what I saw on the screen matched the vision that I had as I read the book.
Some slight liberties were taken with the storyline, but its not a bad thing in the context of what they faced in making a movie out of such a long book. I do recommend that you again read or watch ""Fellowship"" before you go so you can more easily jump into the full storyline and remember all of characters. Be warned that Part II starts with no summary review of the events we saw in last year's film--it just continues.
As a small negative, some of the dialog (like that of Treebeard) seemed overly distorted and a little hard to follow. Thus, I missed a few of the jokes. (Yes, parts are funny, even in the midst of battle.) Maybe it was due to where I sat in the theater, maybe it was due to my failing old ""rock concert"" ears --but maybe that's just the way Ents talk!

1471197,5,B00005JKZU,"Im a huge LOTR fan, having read the books several times for about 20 years now, I had already wondered why noone had made the movie... till Peter Jackson came around with this impressive representation. I will not spoil the movie in case you haven't read the book, so feel free to read on...
First of all, watch the fellowship before the two towers. (yes, reading the book helps, but if you want to experience the two towers at the most, see the fellowship).
The film picks up right where ""fellowship"" left off, and carries on much in the way the books do- back and forth the three storylines. Even though it lasts three hours (im sorry-- 2:59), you won't notice the time (unless you have to go to the bathroom) and by the end, ushers will have to carry you out because you want more... you will hope the lights are on and people are leaving because its an intermission... but no luck.
The film has spectacular visual effects, beautiful landscapes and impressive ""massive"" battle sequences. Jackson manages to either make you forget you are watching a movie or make you think he spent 3 billion on each film due to the realism of each creature, beit the Ents, orcs, wargs or Gollum (which im sure will get an award for realism)... they all look real and move like they were real individual actors. And the real actors each deserve awards for their work, expect to laugh with Gimli's remarks and be shocked by every actor!
What can I tell you... a masterpiece that will be remembered for ages, I thank P.J. for making the movie now that technology is so advanced, and for dedicating so much time and effort to it. He has an enormous responsability towars the fans and readers of the second best selling book in all time (after the bible) and has delivered once more with ""The Two Towers"".
Unfortunately the movie ends and you are left not hungry... you are left STARVING for more! Im a huge fan of LOTR and P.J., so this is what I feel... Im not sure how youll feel, but im sure you'll love it. I cant wait for the DVD to come out!
Congratulations, P.J.!",1040342400,,2053,4.448275862068965
1471198,5,B00005JKZU,"The second part of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy tells what happens to the members of the Fellowship of the Ring after the breaking of their Fellowship.  As the film opens, Sam and Frodo are journeying to Mordor to destroy the ring of power, while Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas search for Mary and Pippin last seen captured by the Uruk-Hai warriors.  I'm happy to say that the Two Towers lives up to expectations and is as good, and in some ways better, than the first.  The Two Towers takes on a darker tone as Middle Earth heads towards war at the hands of Saruman.  Middle Earth literally becomes a battlefield with the epic battle taking place at Helms Deep.  It was reported that it took some three months to film the Helms Deep scenes.  The results are quite spectacular.  Gollum plays a much larger role in this film.  The CGI characterization is fantastic.  An actor played all of Gollums scenes and was later replaced by the CGI character.  The meticulous work here is apparent.  We are also introduced to several new beasts including Wargs, Oliphaunts, and  Fell beasts,  dragon like creatures that serve as the Nazgul's new form of transportation.  Also making a debut is a living, talking tree named Treebeard.  This effect came of great as well, much better then I expected.  Other elements of the film have Aragorn showing his leadership abilities and Frodo feeling the ""weight"" of the ring.  The stage is set for next year's Return of the King.  Some of the scenes are a bit ""scary"" for young children, thus the PG-13 rating (It's rumored that next years extended edition DVD release will include cut scenes that will require an R rating).  This film is worthy of multiple viewings and is highly recommended.",1040342400,,1725,4.69

Brilliantly done and wonderful to watch.  At a three-hour long ride, I still continued to grip the seat handles until the very end and didn't dare wonder off to go to the bathroom.  One word of advice, don't drink before you enter or risk holding it for three hours.  I would probably have sat through the thrid one as well - for a grand total of six hours, but then that one doesn't come out for another year.

1471200,5,B00005JKZU,"After a year of anticipation, increasingly intense with each day of waiting, each spoiler revealed, and each rave early review read, the second part of LOTR has finally arrived. As a wary filmgoer who seldom wastes money on current cineplex junk, I was naturally concerned whether this colossal undertaking will live up to my expectations, let alone its equally collossal hype.
Perhaps, The Two Towers is an easier book to adapt cinematically, because it is more action-based, and its main events occur during a more condensed time period - weeks as opposed to months or years. On the other hand, it creates greater challenges in terms of intercutting between three separate storylines. Peter Jackson does a near-flawless job facing up to these challenges, and largely succeeds. The flaws are still there, but they are less jarring. The ""gloom and doom"" yet hopeful spirit of Tolkien's second book is present in spades, and again - painstalking detail is lavished on all visual aspects of Middle Earth.
Now, the usual discussion of strengths and weaknesses - and the latter are definitely fewer this time around.
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!
-----------------------------------------------
THE GOOD:
1) My favorite character in the entire book was always Gollum, and Jackson's team along with Andy Serkis absolutely nail him. He is best acted and most complex of all, a feat for a CGI creature. As another reviewer said, ""Jar-Jar is not fit to lick Gollum's ***"", a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. When Gollum/Serkis remembers his past as Smeagol, the moment alone is worth the price of admission. Personalit(ies) indeed go a long way. Nearly every scene in the book that featured Gollum is reproduced here, with great accuracy, even the ""rabbit stew"" scene! The final scene of the film is extremely effective, possibly one of the finest.
2) Gimli - yes, he is largely relegated to necessary comic relief, but he is funny, not laughable. His character is actually well realized, because a Dwarf would truly feel like a fish out of water in such foreign surroundings. He also gets to save the day more than a few times. I have a feeling he'll have even more to say and do in the Extended DVD.
3) Merry and Pippin display passion and wit, taking their development further.
4)The movie is historically/geographically minded, and handles various new places and concepts well. The fans even get references to the Bombadil Story omitted from FOTR - the Old Forest and the Barrow-Whigths (Gollum sings their song). All of the landscapes are gorgeous, and 100% Alan Lee.
5) Of course, the epic feel is tremendous and the action spectacular. It is unneeded to even mention. At times it seemed like I was watching something out of the Iliad.
THE NOT-SO-BAD:
1) Arwen and Aragorn came off well, at least non-distracting. The sequence of Arwen mourning and wandering the woods alone was starltingly beautiful.
2) Faramir I never cared much about, so his motivation changes did not bother me. The actor playing him was not very strong however, and didn't impress me. Good thing he had little screen time.
3) Treebeard was decent, not quite as I would have liked but in the context of the film, the ents worked. I know that they will get additional scenes in the DVD from Jackson's interview. Their scenes appeared choppy. The Destruction of Isengard, though, was magnificent - goosebump-worthy.
4) The music was still excessive, but better. The Rohan theme was more pleasing to the ear than any pseudo-Titanic pap.
THE NOT-SO-GOOD:
1) The Rohan ""women and children"" storyline. Used purely for dramatic purposes, cheesy and worn-out. Could have done without it.
2) Sam's long speech about heroic endurance at the end needed some editing. Jackson is not a director known for subtelty.
3) Haldir's real death and Aragorn's fake one were overdone (slow-motion bathos syndrome) , but that is a fairly minor complaint.
4) CGI was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes. In fact, none the action scenes falter much.
------------------------------------------------------------
In closing, I am pleased that TTT not only lived up to the hype/expectations, but managed to exceed them on almost all accounts. A gleeful smile has hardly left my face in all 3 hours, and my expression changed to an annoyed cringe only once or twice - far less than during Fellowship. I have to say that this film was the one (in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre) that I enjoyed the most ever since the good old days of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I do not say that lightly.",1040342400,2,4602,4.962435233160622
1471201,4,B00005JKZU,"Having recently viewed the Director's Cut of the Fellowship of the Ring (containing 30 minutes of added footage and an absorbing documentary on Tolkien's worlds and the making of the film), I was oiled and primed for the Two Towers. I was not dissappointed. Perhaps what stands out, most surprisingly, is the depth of character development - even among newly introduced players, such as Theoden, his daughter Eowyn, Grima Wormtongue, Faramir and, especially, Smeagol ""Gollum"".  Pathos and bravery (with considerable comic relief courtesy of Gimli and Gollum) make for a potent, compelling motion picture experience.
How can one resist the nobility of grim warriors determined to fight bravely despite the certitude of defeat and death?
The battle scene at Helms Deep is the greatest scene of medieval warfare ever hung onto the big screen. Panoramic, close-up and set-piece battle scenes blend together seemlessly. The sword and archery combat is intense and desperate. The only thing missing was boiling oil spilling from the ramparts (but I suppose that would have been too gruesome - and not in keeping with the book -even for this violent film).
Not that fealty to the book was uppermost in the minds of the creators of this film.  Certain improbabilities, plot holes, and deviations from Tolkien do strain credulity.  And REALLY, was it necessary to alter Faramir's character from the books (making him a brutish jerk), add the pointless scene at Osgiliath (fabricated from whole cloth), and shove in the extra orc/warg battle scene as a prelude to Helm's Deep (with Aragorn almost dying but somehow being supernaturally saved by the Elf babe, Arwen)?  Tolkien had nothing to do with any of these scenes and, really, for the most part they do seem a bit pointless.
The above quibblings aside (and Tolkien purists, please take note: these are MINOR quibbles), TTT is THE motion picture to see at the theatre this year. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!
A final note to the more disgruntled reviewers in this space:  remember Bakshi's decrepit attempt, and count your blessings.  In your wildest dreams you could never have hoped for anything even as remotely satisfying as Mr. Jackson & Company's rendering of LOTR thus far.",1040342400,,2215,5.088154269972452
1471202,5,B00005JKZU,"I must admit, I was a little skeptical about the second part of the story. I was not sure that Peter Jackson would pull it off and be able to keep people pinned to their seats for yet another 3 hour stint. I was amazed by the film, not only was I pinned to my seat, The events in the movie unfolded at perfect timing and then gripped tight and took you into the action. The tale picks up and explains in full detail, what happened to Gandalf the Gray and twists the action over to Frodo & Samwise and the quest they share to destroy the One Ring. Certain review sites on the net claim that Golem plays a ""small part"" in this movie. I felt that he played a bigger role in this film than Gandalf, You really get in depth information about who Golem really is and how the One Ring has twisted his mind as many others in the past. Golem is at constant battle with his two halves and Peter Jackson as well as the CG animators pulled this fully computer animated creature off with flying colors. The battle sequences are ""Edge of Your Seat"" action and there are many battles in this installment. There are also new characters in this film which again are pulled off with amazing precision and reality. Weather you are a Lord of The Rings fan or not, you are sure to fully enjoy this 10 star adventure!",1040342400,,1295,4.225806451612903
1471313,5,B00005JKZU,"Having just seen this film for the second time in 1 1/2 days, I now think I can write a reasonable review. All I can say is : WOW! Simply stunning. There are some significant departures from the book, so be warned, all you tolkien-purists. Having read the trilogy many, many, many times since high school( it being my all-time favorite book), it took a couple of viewings to be truly at ease with it. I won't go into a full-scale plot outline here, only to say that the film moves on its own, independent of the book, much like the Fellowship of the Ring did. It's a stand-alone piece, and is a very worthy successor to the first film.
The pace moves along at a great clip, and handles the three story lines quite well, without losing the audiences' attention.
The acting in this film seems of a higher caliber for most involved, which is saying something, since the acting in the first film was mostly top-notch. The visual effects are astounding. One word: Gollum. This CG creation seems to live and breath on film like a true actor, holding his own with anyone in the film. Such misery, such wretchedness, such deceit. The film will likely win the academy award for best visual effects based on his charactor alone, and most deservedly so. I'm sure some will whine about the length of the film( one minute shy of 3 hours), or the alteration of the story line( the charactor of Faramir, for instance), or the increased violence( the battle of Helm's Deep), but this is all moot. This is a fine, fine film, and will stand as an achievement of the first rank, only to be likely topped by next year's finale, The Return of the King.

The Two Towers proves that what Peter Jackson et. al. accomplished in The Fellowship of the Ring was no fluke:  Same absolute tracking with the essentials of Tolkien's story and message (most tellingly revealed when the Elvish forces show up at Helm's Deep to offer their meager but essential support and renew old alliances and pay off old debts); same brilliant portrayal of Aragorn as a man of destiny, yet haunted by his human finitude (I love how they did his relationship to Eomir); same sense of loss and longing, especially in the achingly poignant scenes with Elrond and Arwin; same sweep and grandeur, most telling on display in the mind-boggling battle scenes at Helm's Deep; and (perhaps the key to Jackson's success) same willingness to forego mere cinematic artistry and instead aim for a deep integrity of filmic transposition.
In some ways, The Two Towers is an even greater achievement than the first installment.  As with many trilogies, the second book of LOTR sags.  It is essentially a bridge between books one and three.  How to punch it up to make it play on the screen?  That must've been the filmmaker's greatest problem to solve.  And, with one significant exception, he brilliantly solved it.  Even where the film stumbles slightly--the decision to recast Faramir as one tempted by the ring as was his brother Boromir--one sees that it was done to add drama to what is otherwise a more elegiac scene, something that would be difficult to convincingly portray as film.  But Jackson's slight change in adding weight and agency to Saruman pays off huge here.  And his rendering of Grima Wormtongue--along with the transformation of Theoden--is a very fine achievement.
All in all, I have nothing but admiration for this project.  Highest recommendation.",1040256000,,1895,4.912225705329154
1471315,5,B00005JKZU,"This is a perfect sequal to The Fellowship. It keeps to the book well, but is also well cut to fit into a three hour movie. It deffinitely doesn't seem like a three hour movie either; by the time it is over everyone is thinking ""but they can't finish it there! there has to be more!"" The acting is just as spectacular as in the first film, and the music is just different enough to be new but still has some threads of the old soundtrack to string the two movies together. The special effects are beyond compare, just as in the first film, and the cinematography is fantastic. This movie is quite a bit more dark than the first one (what can you expect though, Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor, and the rest of the company is just starting to fight the huge battle against Sauron)but there are bleeps of comic relief, oddly enough, most coming from Gollum. I was afraid Treebeard and Gollum would look ridiculously fake and silly, but I was pleasantly surprised by Treebeard realistic Entness and Gollum's realistic creepiness. Can you tell I loved the movie? It was fantastic and I will probably end up seeing it 10 times before it leaves the theatre, just like I saw The Fellowship;0). Everyone should see it!!",1040256000,,1222,4.509009009009009
1471316,5,B00005JKZU,"I saw this movie yesterday, and already I've overheard one comment from the theater I was at, as well as a comment from a workmate, who said that they were disappointed with something(s) about this movie. Whether it'd be that it didn't follow the book EXACTLY, or it just wasn't as good as the first. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but I beg to differ as far as it not being as good as the first movie.
Sure, it doesn't follow the book exactly. Neither did the last one. In fact, as far as I know, there were probably just as many differences from the book in this movie as there were in the last. For example, in the book of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" Gandalf takes many years to get back to the Shire(wasn't it like 50 years?) before he tells Frodo to set off on his quest to destroy the One Ring. Also, the ENTIRE Tom Bombadil scene was cut from the movie - including the scene where they obtain the swords to kill the Nazgul where they meet the Barrow-wights (I assume that perhaps the swords that Aragorn gave the hobbits at Weathertop are the swords that kill the Nazgul, but I can't be certain). Also, dialogue was switched around from what it was in the book, like someone in the movie saying a line that was originally someone else's line in the book. Or the same person who said a line in the book says it in the movie but at a different point in the story(a.k.a. Gandalf's ""all we need to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us"" speech and his story of Gollum; in the book it was at Bag End, but in the movie it was in Moria.) Also, we never see Gandalf talk to Radagast the Brown (another wizard). And, Boromir dies at the end of the movie, whereas he died at the beginning of the second book. Lastly, they never went to Farmer Maggot's house where we discover that Merry and Pippin knew something about Bilbo having the One Ring. And I know there were more changes.
And what changes were made to ""The Two Towers' story in the movie? Faramir was meaner, they didn't go to Gondor, we don't see Saruman wandering the woods, Elves were at Helm's Deep, Wormtongue makes it to Isengard before the Ents flooded it, Arwen was in it, Eowen went with them, and certain things were pushed back until the third movie. There were a few more, but there were not many more changes than what was done in the first film. And that's not what gets me. What gets me is that people complain about these changes, and NONE of them were bad! The movie still worked very well! It still stayed 90-95% true to the book(if you got that percentage on a term paper - that's an A grade my friends!). The only reason anyone would see these changes as bad is because <snobby, whiny & complaining voice>""It wasn't in the books!""</snobby, whiny & complaining voice>
Come on! This movie was fantastic! It's still very true to the book, Gollum was cool and funny, Gimli was hilarious, and the battles were so epic in scale it's not even funny. The Ents were just as I had pictured them - both character and visual-wise. The conflict with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum was perfect. Helm's Deep was terrific and very epic in scope. And the destruction of Isengard was just amazing. We really got a great picture.
I think ultimately when one goes to a movie and comes out loving it, they will build up the sequels to such high expectations that they end up disappointed. Why not just expect the sequels to NOT be as good, since it's impossible to capture lightning in a bottle - and then come out not so disappointed?
This movie was awesome. Just as great as the first one.

1471317,4,B00005JKZU,"O.K so where do I start?
First the good
The cinematography was-Excellent it takes you and draws you into this world of Middle Earth, that in and of itself is stunning and it deserves that oscar at the very least(but will not get it if last year is any indication of things to come)
The acting from all quarters was very good I particularly liked Orlando Bloom and Vorg(Aragon) these two performed the best in making their characters come alive. Everyone else did a very good job but these are the performances that stand out
The Ents-Providing some very good comic relief in this movie are the tree shepherds the oldest of whom ""Treebeard"" is the oldest living thing under the sun in Middle Earth.  The ents also look really cool and if you witness nothing else in this movie you should see part where the Ents smack the .... out of Isenguard (the wizard Saurman's stronghold)
Gollum-Hats off to the guy that was cast to fill this role, just like I always pictured him
Helms Deep-The set is just really good looking you have to see the movie in order to judge for yourself
Now the bad
O.K first le me say this I am not a Tolken literalist but the book got totally chopped up an diced, not that I mind some of the new parts were good.  I just had to endure the moaning and whining of all the literalists at the theater.
The Character of John Ryees Davis played a little too heavy on the comic relife aspect of the movie, it got annoying(not that most of it wasn't funny)
The ending-As in the last one there was no end.  Let me clarify (I'm talking to people who have read the book right now).  Guys we know how it ends but what is John Q. Public who is just there for a night of escape supposed to think?  I mean it just stops!  Jackson could have done a little better with that particular aspect of the movie
My overall impression-I loved this movie I really Good Special Effects although it was a little slow at times.  An all round good movie",1040256000,,1944,4.30958904109589
1471318,5,B00005JKZU,"Unlike many of the ""reviewers"" who wrote ""reviews"" BEFORE the movie was even released (How can you review something you have never seen?), I have seen the movie.  It was honestly one of the best movies that I have seen in the past few years.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan, but The Two Towers was much better than either of the Harry Potter movies, which are excellent in their own right.  I also liked it more than ""Fellowship"" which I loved to begin with.  There is a lot of action, but there is also charm and humor.  The characters seem to have more depth than they did in the first movie.  I also like the ending of Two Towers much more, because it kind of ""wraps up"" a little more instead of just ending abruptly.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether or not they are Tolkien fans.",1040256000,,797,4.23841059602649

The two towers on the other hand........ I have to wonder if peter jackson even had a copy of the second book. This movie did everything but follow the storyline of the book. Don't get me wrong the graphics and action and all that were outstanding, but why even make a movie after a book if you aren't going to follow the book, at least a little. I for one am disappointed, and doubt that I'll visit the theatre to see it as many times as the first.",1040256000,5,594,4.0423728813559325
1471320,5,B00005JKZU,"I had the pleasure of watching the Two Towers last night with my family and a sold out auditorium.  We were not disappointed.
I will try to convey a little of the excitement surrounding this film without giving away spoilers - the film's own trailor gives away FAR too much already, in my opinion.
The thrill that pulsed through the theater audience as various characters made their screen appearance was palpable.  Much has been made of Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn, Andy Serkis' remarkable portrayal of Gollum/Smeagol, Ian McKellen's startling transformation from certain death as Gandalph the Grey to return as Gandalph the White, and the incredible staging of the Battle of Helm's Deep.
What I had not expected was the power of the individual characters of John Rhys-Davies as Gimli and Orlando Bloom as Legolas.  Gimli is given most of the lighter, more humorous moments - but he also proves at Helm's Deep to be a greater warrior than his Dwarvish size would suggest.  When Orlando Bloom's Legolas first strolls across the screen in the opening moments of the film I could hear the sounds of swooning women all around me.  And Legolas' character displays some of the film's finer and noblest moments, in particular scenes with Aragorn.  At Helm's Deep let's just say you would not want to be an enemy of Legolas - in his fighting scenes he is not only a prolific dispatcher of the enemy, but also marvelously graceful.
The special effects fill the screen, but do not dominate the story.  This story contained within this film does not stand on it's own - it requires the volumes before and after.  But this is true of Tolkien's original work as well - Lord of the Rings is meant to be taken as a whole, broken into three ""smaller"" pieces for ease of digestion.
What ""middle"" part of a film trilogy can compare?  Godfather II?  The Empire Strikes Back?  This film stands in very high company.
Lord, let me live long enough to see ""Return of the King"".
Bravo, Peter Jackson, crew and cast.  Bravo.",1040256000,,1998,4.726224783861672
1471321,4,B00005JKZU,"I should probably be giving this movie five stars but my actual honest opinion is that it's a 4 and 1/2 star movie, and only because it strays from the book a lot more than Fellowship did. While Fellowship may have left out Tom Bobmabadle and other things there wasn't a lot of material added to the movie that wasn't at least implied in the books (IE the relationship between Aragorn and Arwin). However, this movie ads much to the story that wasn't in the book The Two Towers, and while some of it works, like the elves coming to aid against the Oruki, other parts had me a little frustrated. Faramir was not given the chance to be the good man that he was in the books, and came off as being a real jerk right up until the end. I didn't feel the desperation from Faramir that I felt from Boromir in the Fellowship of the Ring, and I didn't feel for him the way I did in the book, but then a lot of things happen in the book that it seems that they are holding for the third movie. I don't recall Faramir taking Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to Gondor in the book either.
 Despite these additions, and some occasionally poor CGI effects the movie still managed to hold me in awe throughout the entire 179 minutes. Most of the film is simply breathtaking, even though there are moments where some of the CGI creatures were not very convincing.
 On the other hand there's Gollum who put Yoda to shame. Yoda da man? I think not. Gollum! Gollum! To be honest I have a very well trained eye, and CGI effects do not convince me very often, but Gollum fooled my eyes! He looked so real, right down to the pours in his skin, convincing animation, facial expressions... and this boy delivered the most amazing performance of the movie, dealing out a dual personality, and moving the way he did... I'm impressed. Without a doubt Gollum is the best looking CGI character ever... on the other hand I felt that the Ents could have looked more realistic, and on occasion you run into those CGI wolves that the orcs were riding that were not as well done as they could have been either... but then again I know how difficult it is to have hundreds of thousands of photo realistic characters on screen at once.
 Over all I loved this movie, but I think that some aspects could have been better. I was upset to see it stray so much from the book, and yet it was still an epic of massive proportions. Still true, in spirit at least to the tone of the novel, if only in spirit. While Fellowship is the better of the two films so far I view the Two Towers as a bridge between to huge points, as with any trilogy the middle chapter is the thinnest, as far as plot and character development, and while this still has plenty of plot and character it is still thinner than the Fellowship, and I'm expecting the Return of the King to be the biggest of all, especially since so much that happened at the end of the Two Towers novel did NOT happen in the movie... but with the cliffhanger ending the movie had, one has to believe that Peter Jackson is just saving some of those big moments for the last movie.",1040256000,,3077,4.292598967297763
1471322,4,B00005JKZU,"While the title of this film should be called ""The Showdown at Helms Deep,"" instead of ""The Two Towers,"" this next installment of The Lord of the Rings is nevertheless very impressive. While being a bit different compared to the novel, director, Peter Jackson weaves a timeless film about adventure, love and valor.

1471424,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the continuation of last year's Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo the ring bearer (Elijah Wood) and his trusted companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) find themselves going in circles while trying to get to Mordor. They realize they're being followed by the ring obsessed creature Gollum, they capture him and Frodo decides to use him as a guide to Mordor. Gollum is exactly the way I imagined him in the book, well except for the fact I pictured him green. Well anyway he's very well done, he steals the show in fact. After the movie he's all people talked about. While watching it I even found myself thinking too bad the actor that plays Gollum ""but was replaced by CGI of course"" can't be nominated. Gollum by the way is absolutely no Jar Jar Binks, he's what George wishes Jar Jar could be like . I especially wouldn't mind seeing The Hobbit get made and get some more light shed on Gollum's past.
 Well besides Frodo and Sam's adventure Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf who has returned more powerful have to defend Helm's Deep from Saruman's huge army of Orks. Also Merry and Pippen escape from a gang of Orks and stumble apon a talking tree named Tree Beard. They try to convince him and his group of other talking trees named Ents to fight against Sauruman and his army as the world is at stake.
 To sum it all up this movie is just fantastic. The visuals, the locations, the action and the cast are all just incredible. Also I have to say that I don't agree with Roger Ebert's complaints at all in his review. He really needs to read the books he claims he knows so well again. There's something wrong when you give the Harry Potter movies 4 stars and the LOTR movies only 3 stars. If he read Potter books he'd see those movies aren't entirely faithful to the books either.
 Yes the other characters such as Aragorn have a bigger part to play than the Hobbits but can't say I found that to be any different in the books. They are taught to be braver by people like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and get braver by the 3rd book. So if he'd be patient, will probably be the same with the movies. He acts like Peter Jacksons version will have J.R.R. Tolken rolling around in his grave which I don't think is the case at all. He takes making the adaption from book to screen seriously and you can tell that just by looking at the scenes with Gollum. The part where Gollum is in the sacred pond catching a fish and Frodo has to convince him to leave is exactly the way I pictured it while reading the book. The way Gollum has conversations with his other personality Smeagol is just simply awesome, it's scary, funny and pure genious at the same time. Pure genious is exactly what should be said about this masterpiece of an epic adventure. To add to my review it's nice to that the Two Towers has been nominated for best picture. I can't imagine why Peter Jackson hasn't been nominated for best director again though. Also 2 actors that deserved to be nominated are Miranda Otto as owyn
Bernard Hill and Thoden. Miranda Otto is as gifted of an actress as she is beautiful, she really makes you feel her love for Aragorn. Bernard Hill is wonderful as well, I've seen a few names nominated for best supporting actor  this year that I don't think deserve it more than him. Of course they should of found some way to nominate Gollum as well as he steals the show almost completely.",1040256000,,3419,4.4222222222222225

Faramir was supposed to be the more honorable, wiser brother, which i guess he was in the end. aside from that, the movie was done even better than the first, and it's looking like the third will be even better. i'm counting the days already. this movie is more than worth the $8 and sore neck. i'm gonna do it again and again, i think, probably until X-2 in May.",1040256000,,1158,4.386046511627907
1471426,5,B00005JKZU,"Peter Jackson is going to be a legend in Hollywood. For the first time in my life, I sat down to a sequel that literally felt like it simply picked up where the other film left off. Filming all three films at once undoubtedly contributed to this. The characters, the mood, and the intensity of the first film were unchanged because the actors never had to break character. And even though visual effects abound, the use of actual full scale sets and thousands of extras for battle scenes were an obvious impact on the performance of the actors and actresses. As good as everyone is, the film belongs to Gollum. He is the character you will leave thinking about. His grotesque, sympathetic, and sometimes even humorous persona is animated and performed to absolute perfection. He is truly the most believable CG character on screen to date. If any CG character could ever be nominated for a best actor oscar, it should be Smeagol.
For Tolkien purists, you'll find more changes from the book in this film than in the Fellowship of the Ring. It is for you to argue among yourselves whether or not the changes were good. Most, in my opinion, were for setup purposes for the final film. However, the middle section of the movie is likely to be the most controversial. It apparently is taken from an appendix Tolkien wrote concerning Aragorn and Arwen. I am unsure of an event in the middle of this film involving Aragorn especially. It might also be a part of the appendix. If not, it is most certainly a large liberty to take with Tolkien's story and I'm sure many who love the books will be scratching their heads here. This added segment is at least twenty to thirty minutes in length. This may seem inconsequential, however, when you realize that the film is ending long before the final chapter of Two Towers arrives, you may be asking why Peter Jackson decided add this segment when it cost him a more breathtaking and pivotal sequence later.
Some other unexpected changes include an early visit to Gondor (which is most likely intended to set the scene for the next film) and the omission of much of the visit with Treebeard. The Ent sequence will likely be another topic of discussion, as some of the effects looked very unrealistic here compared with the cinematic glory of the rest of the film. Several scenes using a blue screen behind Merry and Pippin revert to the incredibly fake blue screen shots of the 50's and 60's. These two talented actors are also given very little to do and their pleasant banter is sorely missed. This however, does not differ too much from the book. What was a greater dissappointment to myself was the absence of the continual banter between Sam and Smeagol that made me laugh out loud while reading the book. We only get a glimmer of the extreme tension between the two in this film. The Director can hardly be criticized for this however, when you realize that to include everything would have created a six hour film, rather than three.
Gimli proves to be the comic relief in this film and his growing friendship and bond with Legolas is evident. Orlando Bloom once again plays Legolas with the unblinking (and I mean the guy never blinks!) intensity we've come to expect. Much focus is place on Aragorn and the films center has shifted a great deal. Aragorn is becoming a more central part of the story, and previous big players are standing more in the background. The most noticible step back is by Gandalf. However, he literally shines in every moment he is given and no one could argue that few characters have been given such a grand entrance in decades. New characters that I'm anxious to see much more of are the King of Rohan and his lovely daughter Eowyn. Eowyn's character is mesmerizing and Miranda Otto plays her with an amazing grace. Wormtongue, is as unlikeable and despicable as he should be.
You will find that despite the heart thumping battle scenes that take your breath away, the Two Towers also is also surprisingly touching - a combination that few fantasy films have perfected or even attempted. Expect your emotions to run the gammet here. Peter Jackson, master cinematic chef that he is, has cooked up a masterpiece and in spite of a few minor changes in the recipe, The Two Towers will leave you with nothing but a delicious taste of Tolkien.",1040256000,,4310,4.650065530799476
1471427,5,B00005JKZU,"I was one of the first people to see the second instalment in the Epic tale that is Lord of the Rings. To begin, Two Towers which is the second part in the ongoing Tolkien tale of Middle Earth starts off where it finished in the Fellowship of the Ring.
The tale of Sam Gangee and Frodo Baggins is but a sub-plot in this film as the film follows the story of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and the battle of Helm's Deep. I should mention that this film does not pursue the Adventure Genre that its predecessor had done. Two Towers will remind you more of a war genre, such as Patton, than the mystical journey of the ring. And this is not for the worse, the depiction of Good Vs Evil runs rampant throughout the 3 hours of the film in awe-inspiring visuals. The cinematography in the film is much darker when we get glimpses of what Sauron's forces are doing in Mordor while we get much brighter cinematography when seeing the Elvish and Human lands near Helm's Deep.
The CGI (Computer Generated Images) is used to perfection when portraying the image of 10,000 Orcs strong waiting to go into battle. The Costumes and Make-up displayed throughout the evil army captures the gritty, ugly and Medieval style that Peter Jackson (Director) brings to the audience.  The location manager of the film must be commended also for finding the sites of the main locations thoroughly described in Tolkien's tale. One of the first things you will notice in the film is the beautiful landscapes. New Zealand as the choice of Middle Earth was one of the smartest decisions the Film team could of made and this can be seen when multiple locations that exhibit completely different styles can all be filmed in the one country. Amazing.
The acting is once again stellar. All characters are played to perfection as their character development is evident throughout the film. Aragorn becomes more and more of a leader, Legolas and Gimli start to form a friendship, Merry and Pippen gain more bravery and courage plus Sam and Frodo portray the understanding of their destiny's to a T. Another aspect of the film and characters that should be mentioned is that there is more comedy in this story. Gimli comes into his own when his height becomes exploited and he complies to being `tossed'. This is the best time to add the comedy as it is the middle part of the Legendary tale and would not have been a wise choice to include in the first part (Establishing the Danger) or the third part (The pivotal dramatic ending).
The Score is once again magical. The Orchestration gives you that energetic feel as though you want to be there fighting to save Middle-earth. There is not one aspect to change about the music as it surpasses its original purpose and gives you a more dramatic and unforgettable edge to the film.
The construction of the film may be a deterrent to some people as it is the very middle section of Lord of the Rings. While in Fellowship there was a beginning to the film, The Two Towers immediately goes into the thick of the story giving us a brief summary of each of the characters and where they're located. You may also find yourself thinking why you're watching a 3 hour epic of a film with no real ending. Simple. Its brilliant. If you have not read the books, you want to know what obstacles the characters will encounter and most probably see some action plus can proudly claim that you have seen this classic of a film. And for those who have read the book, you would want to know how alike and dislike the book is to the film and how each moment will be portrayed compared to your imagination and/or Tolkien's novel description. I have to stress that this is a Must-See!
For all those Bloodthirsty fans out there who want to see the warriors `Hunt some Orc' shall not be disappointed as the battle of Helm's Deep will surpass your expectations in the 45 minute long battle-fest. An interesting note, the actors and extras that did this battle found it to be the most gruelling scene out of all them. As it was filmed at night in the rain and they had to wait hours on end to get a shot set-up while some battled with hyperthermia. Now that just shows the raw passion and commitment to make this film grow beyond people's wildest expectations.
We are also joined by all the favourite and significant characters in the first film. **Spoilers** Gandalf makes his return as Gandalf the White and makes a memorable quote to set up the final chapter of Middle-earth. ""The battle of Helm's Deep has ended. Now the battle for Middle-earth had Begun"". We are also joined again by the schizophrenic hybrid of Gollum, who we see in full for the first time and is the best CG character to ever grace the cinema screen. We are also joined by a few new characters of Treebeard, who helps the comedy duo of Merry and Pippen through their escape of Mordor. Each are classics in their own right.
To finish off, this movie is a must-see. It may not have that first magical experience you encountered during the first movie but it delivers what it set out to do and create a stunner of a film. The acting, CGI, story, costumes, make-up, locations, characters, cinematography and score is absolutely extraordinary. I really couldn't make up my mind if this movie surpassed the first film (Probably have to watch it again) but I can tell you it is a 5 star movie. Each person will have their own preference to which movie they favour but believe me, it will be hard to decide.

1471429,5,B00005JKZU,"This one in a way reminded me of Star Wars Episode II. That means it had a much more exciting plot, more character developement, better special effects, better acting, and a more complex plot line. This was better than Episode II because it had better acting. The special effects were incredible, and the pace of the movie made it seem like 1 hour instead of 3 hours and 15 minutes. See this now, it is the best movie of 2002!",1040256000,,426,4.3375
1471430,5,B00005JKZU,"I thought it was a very good follow up to Fellowship of the Ring. Great effects, great score, great characters, and one of the most exciting hours at the end including a truly mind blowing battle.  My only problem with it is that I didn't think the pacing was all that good.  Where as Fellowship was 2 and 1/2+ hours and seemed like an hour and half or so to me (being so enthralled), The Two Towers, bein ga 3 hour movie, really did seem like one.  Too many ups and downs and flashback scenes of aragon and Arwen that I really just didn't find all that interesting.  I'm not sure why, but I really don't like how the love relationship is handled.  Anyway, its a worthy chapter in the Trilogy and I recommend it immensely.
On a side note I hope they make The Hobbit.  I Think it will definitely be made after the success Fellowship had and the success that TTT and Return of the King are bound to have.  I do think it is a better movie to do later though because the dragon is really going to be a hard CG character to make look real.  I had just recently saw Reign of Fire and I thought they did a decent job on it considering they only had a mid-level budget.  Jackson has 100 million for each of these movies and with success only comes bigger budgets so if they do make the Hobbit the dragon should be really amazing.

It ends with a similar feel to The Fellowship of the Ring, only much darker. The Helm's Deep and Rohan scenes were amazing... very well done. The Ents are really amazing and fun to watch. Gollum is also a very entertaining character and very well created. The scenes of the Elven Haven of Rivendell are just as beautiful if not more than The Fellowship of the Ring although fairly short. Aragorn's dreams of Arwen are very touching and lovely. The only thing I don't like is that I have to wait an ENTIRE year for the next movie, The Return of the King, to come out.

It was released today, and I went to see it. I had really high expectations for this movie. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was one of my favorite movies, and I was hoping (and expecting) this movie to be just as good, if not better. And it totally was! This movie is undescribably good. It's exciting, it's partly romance, it's got a lot of action. I do recommend that you see the first movie first, because this movie would make much more sense.
This movie continues the stories of the characters from Fellowship of the Ring. Their paths have split up, and they're in groups doing different things. It's got adventure and fighting in it, just like the first movie, and it has more of the characters' stories. Oh yeah, and the special effects are totally awesome!
This movie is a must-see for anyone who even slightly likes Lord of the Rings. If you thought the first Lord of the Rings was okay, you'll most likely like this one. If you liked the first Lord of the Rings, you'll most likely love this movie. It is one of the greatest movies ever. I actually liked it better then the first Lord of the Rings movie, which is totally amazing. This movie totally passed beyond my high expectations. Everyone, SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS COMPLETELY, TOTALLY AWESOME!!! I'm not exaggerating at all! The only bad thing is, now we have to wait a whole more year for the last movie!

That said, it was quite disappointing in the many points where it diverged from the book. I'm not such a stickler that I can't handle a few differences -- I agreed with all of the changes made to Fellowship that were necessary to make the story flow on screen. But making Faramir a bad guy? And what's the deal with the wimpy Ents? Visually appealling, but an intellectual let down. I almost wish I didn't love the books so I could have enjoyed the movie.

1471523,4,B00005JKZU,"*Spoilers Ahead* - though being the second most read book of the 20th century, it shouldn't spoil much for many.
I went into the second movie with very high expectations, and I think with good reason. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with the first film, and as far as effects, the second film does not disappoint, with a couple small exceptions. The aspects that I was not as pleased with were major story changes and pacing.
In Fellowship, I was most irritated by Arwen's role increase, particularly as I am not a Liv Tyler fan. In Towers, there are a lot more serious changes that, I feel, dramatically alter Tolkien's work.
My criticism:
- The army of Elves does not march to Helm's Deep to help. The ""Last Alliance of Men and Elves"" was just that - the LAST. This is a MAJOR change. Tolkien's Elves were done interfering in the world of men.
- Eomer and his Riders do not come to help as late as they do - the forest moves in at dawn. That is the aid that Gandalf brings. The orcs disappear in the trees.
- The Ents make the decision at Entmoot to go to war. It's not the Hobbits' doing at all.
- Faramir is not tempted by the Ring. He does not make Frodo go to Osgiliath. He gives them provisions and helps them on their way. The point in the book is that he's the opposite of Boromir.
- I wish that another actor voiced Treebeard, as there is one cut that goes from Gimli to Treebeard and you can tell it's the same voice.
- The movie ends short of the mark. The last line in the book is ""Frodo was alive, but taken by the enemy."" The movie ends before Shelob's Lair.
- The whole Saruman possessing King Theoden was a little over the top. I sincerely doubt Tolkien meant anything about actual spiritual possession.
- Frodo's fall into the Dead Marshes was a little overblown as far as the effects. It seemed amateurish compared to other effects in the films.
- The other effects problem I referred to earlier are the shots of Merry and Pippin walking with Treebeard; you can really tell that a blue screen was used.
- Gimli was made into a joke. He didn't have a serious line in the film. And did they really need to bring Dwarf-tossing back into it?
The good stuff:
- Gollum was well done. I was happy with his animation and with the personality conflict that showed through.
- The Nazgul steeds were also well imagined, as it's not the clearest of descriptions in the text.
- Lots of good Legolas action - especially the mount onto the horse - you'll see what I mean.
- Music was excellent. Kudos to Howard Shore yet again.
- Great battle sequences at Helm's Deep.
- There are others, but I'm much more irritated right now then impressed, so I'm not remembering them all.
Overall, it was good but unsettling. It starts fast, but slows, then quickens, then doesn't have a main pace. It doesn't have near the character development that the first film had - and, of course, shouldn't need it, as many have already been established. But it feels like something is missing - that connection you had with the characters in the first film just wasn't there. This is a very difficult book to adapt, and I don't begrudge them the job. I just expected it to be truer to Tolkien's vision.
Of course, you really must see it regardless. It's beautiful and still the best anyone's ever done with the story. I greatly look forward to the Extended DVD and Peter Jackson's explanation of these story changes.",1040169600,79,3400,4.398412698412699
1471524,5,B00005JKZU,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second part of the trilogy, which is a a superb transition between the The Fellowship of the Rings and the future The Return of the King.  The begining is rather fragmented and it resembles the moment of losing hope that the broken fellowship is sensing.  Frodo is off on his quest with Sam trying to find a way into Mordor to destroy the ring while they are being stalked by Gollum.  In a different direction, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to hunt down the uruk-hai and orcs that have kidnapped Merry and Pippen.  Meanwhile, Saruman is sending troops into Rohan and someone is clouding the thoughts of Rohan's King.  Many different subplots emerge and they all seem to lead towards one common threat, the evil within Mordor.  The Two Towers deals with many different issues such as immorality, love, compassion, hope, and many more in a very real manner while the looming war is drawing nearer.",1040169600,,944,4.656626506024097
1471525,5,B00005JKZU,"Thats what the rest of Hollywood will have to do after Peter Jackson has finished his trilogy. ""The Two Towers"" surpasses its predecessor in every way possible - scale, action, humor, plot and acting. As ""Fellowship.."" was clearly Elijah Wood's film, this one has Viggo Mortensen written all over it. Aragorn all but steals the show and engages in some of the most spectacular battle sequences ever filmed. I'm sure that all know the story by now, but the Helm's Deep sequence at the end of the film is truly all that it has been hyped up to be. A jaw-dropping, knee shaking, and breathless sequence that can only be described as a medieval version of the Alamo.
Jackson's skillful eye for detail has made this remarkable film an instant classic, and ranks this trilogy right alongside the original Star Wars trilogy in terms of epic entertainment. A thrill a minute ride that will be sure to ellicit numerous viewings...saw it today and I am going to see it on Friday already!! Don't want to spoil anything, but the Ents' assault on Isengard was my favorite part, with Helm's Deep a close second. Could strongly challenge for a Best Picture Oscar...yeah, its that damned good. Don't miss out!!!",1040169600,,1195,4.75
1471526,5,B00005JKZU,"Be forewarned that there are no catching up for the first opening scene jumps straight to Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) engaged in a fierce tussle with the Balrog after plunging from a vertiginous cliff. The 3-hour long epic continues the saga from where The Fellowship of The Ring left off in the literary fantasy gem by J.R.R Tolkien; the second in the trilogy.
And this movie succeeds the predecessor in every manner under Peter Jackson's direction to become a magnum opus of tremendous power, visual splendor and emotional core that will make Tolkien proud. Every moment in this majestic adventure sweeps you with its elegiac tone and dark suspense with the judicious use of astonishing CGI effects that you never thought could materialize in such supremacy.
The fantasy tells of the journey hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) embarks to destroy The One Ring that tempts humanity into evil and Frodo becomes increasingly powerless to the attraction. Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) is his sole companion as the rest of his motley gang is separated. Merry (Dominic Monaghen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) captured by the Orcs, harrowingly escapes to Fangorn Forest. Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) pursues relentlessly for the missing two and arrives at Rohan.
It is amazing how these three paths interweaves with its own clarity to pave the road to the showdown at Helm's Deep where the people of Rohan under the rule of King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and niece Eowyn  (Miranda Otto) battles against the 10,000 strong Uruk Hai cavalry. The Dark Lord Sauron has aligned forces with Saruman the White (Christopher Lee) to wipe out mankind and it is up to Aragon to bind Rohan and Gandor against the dark forces.
The Two Towers is a full-fledged action adventure but also a deeply moving tale of freedom, massacre and enslavement. Peter Jackson's bold cinematic angles and close-ups effectively conveys personal intimacy and emotions besides the grandeur. In an unprecedented revolutionizing move, he employs evocative complexed digital creatures such as Gollum the elfin and Ents the ancient talking trees to relay subtly the devastating psychological effects of evil and ecological messages respectively.
His ambitious work shot over 2 years in New Zealand and a bloating budget of 310 million has being rewarded fruitfully with increasing followers who are being enchanted by his interpretation of Middle Earth with lush greenery and rolling mountains as well as shadowly swamps that makes the period convincingly real. The gorgeous cinematography has replaced the explanation of the plot that hindered the first episode.
It is no longer a tale of the conventional struggle between evil and good but also one of fraternity and gives one the conviction of the heroes's affirmation and belief. It is touchingly poignant as the allegory gains currency in the modern zeigeist of terrorism and defies categorization. Constantly riveting and exhilarating, Jackson's passion for the sprawling saga has turned it into a fragile objet d' art and a revolutionizing piece of epic work, accomplished in every sense.",1040169600,,3159,5.230769230769231
1471527,5,B00005JKZU,"We just got home from seeing The Two Towers and oh!  It is WONDERFUL!  As a fan of The Lord of the Rings for about 35 years, I am still stunned at how authentic Peter Jackson and everyone associated with this trilogy have been able to make it.  This one is as good or better than Fellowship if that's possible.  I NEVER thought anyone would be able to do this profound and many-leveled, many-event, story justice but they have done it.  Obviously they can't include everything that's in the books or everything exactly like the books BUT what they have done is convey the depth and feel of the epic - they have retained its very essence and why it is a masterpiece.
We sat riveted for the entire approximately 3 hours. Riveted.
What more can I say?
Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it a zillion times like I did Fellowship and I REALLY can't wait for The Return of the King.

1471528,5,B00005JKZU,"Have you spent much of the last year wondering about what to expect with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers?  I have.  The first film dug itself under my skin and became as precious to me as the Ring is to Gollum.  Going for 364 days to see the next chapter has been grueling at times.  But (sigh) here I am.
(Begin Spoilers)
The film picks up with a flashback to Gandalf battling the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-Dum.  We see it all over, except we see more of Gandalf's fall as he continues to fight the Balrog.  Frodo jerks awake suddenly, and we see we have been watching a dream.
The film wastes no time drawing the audience in.  Fans of the first film will certainly love this one, probably equally, maybe better.  The tone is a bit different, as the tone of the book was different than that of the first.  There are more discrepancies in the story here than there were in 'Fellowship,' and more liberties taken as a result.  Does this hurt the film? Not at all, as long as you're not a Tolkien purist.
The cast is once again great, with John Rhys Davies' Gimli having more to do, as well as his turn as the voice of Treebeard adding charm to the CG character.
Speaking of CG characters, Gollum is very impressive.  He's obviously CG-based, but the motion capture of actor Andy Serkis, as well as his grovelly voice, help to make a sympathetic character.
Karl Urban (Eomer), Bernard Hill (Theoden), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), Brad Dourif (Wormtongue), and David Wyndham (Faramir) are all approproately cast, with Hill and Otto giving the strongest performances among the newcomers.
Howard Shore's score is great, once again hitting in all the right places, and fitting the grand scale of the movie.  The Helm's Deep sequence is stunning, but there is much more to love in this film.  The re-introduction of Gandalf is a nicely done moment, as is Sean Astin's speech as Sam near the end.  The movie ends on an even bigger tease than the end of FOTR... leaving us salivating for Return of the King.

I am not going to give any spoilers away here so if that is what you are looking for please see the other posting with spoilers.. Instead.. I am going to give you a short rundown of the parts I found wonderfull..
1) The movie began with a bang.. By showing us what happened to our beloved wizard as he feel down the hole.. I found myself cheering.. <g>
2) The acting was again superb!  The director again showed his eye for understanding this Middle Earth.
3) The CGI.. Ahh the CGI.. It was awesome!!!  Specially the big battle which is all CGI but, you would swear that it was not..  And then there is Gollum.. Being a CGI creature you would thing that they would not pan to him to much but, instead he is very prolific in this movie and very.. very.. well done..
4) The three subplots will just blow your mind away.. (well there are actually more then three but, you count them..
5) The musical score is just fantastic!!
And there is my list.. If I may say soo this movie was (if possible) better then the first movie!  Wonder what they will do in the third and final movie?",1040169600,,1235,4.220338983050848
1471530,5,B00005JKZU,"Like all of us, I've been looking forward to the second installment of Peter Jackson's _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy for a year now.  _The Two Towers_ has always been my favourite of the original trilogy.  Well, I'm happy to say the _The Two Towers_, the movie met and exceeded my expectations in nearly every respect.
Taking up where FoTR left off, ""Towers"" follows the now sundered members of the Fellowship on their disparate paths.  Frodo and Sam are heading for Mordor, hooking up along the way with Gollum, who agrees to guide them.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin, eventually coming to Rohan where they are caught up in that country's struggle against Saruman.  Merry and Pippin come through a series of perils to the forest of Fangorn, where they meet Treebeard the Ent.  By the end of the movie, everyone will have fought some kind of battle, either personal or monumental, against overwhelming odds.
Overall, _The Two Towers_ is even truer to the original than was FoTR.  Jackson takes a lot of time to go through this important part of the trilogy, with the result that he's only about 2/3 of the way through the book by the end.  I didn't mind this at all.  IN fact, I thought the slower pace was a good juxtaposition with the intensity of many of the events and the transitions seemed much less hectic than they were in FoTR.  I enjoyed the added material, particularly the extra Rohan scenes that set up the situation and the characters.  Many places in this movie, Jackson shows us things that are only told or alluded to in the book, and it works very well.
Once again the acting was great, both from the old characters and the new.  I loved the casting of Miranda Otto as Eowyn.  Brad Dourif shone as Grima Wormtongue, a character I always found somewhat flat in the books, and Bernard Hill as Theoden was also great.  I can't wait to see more of Eomer -- he ruled every scene he was in.
The CG effects were amazing.  I loved the Ents, who were a perfect combination of treeishness and bipedal humanoid.  But the real star goes to Gollum, a character so real that I could hardly believe he...uh...wasn't real.  The portrayal of his struggle between his ""Slinker"" and ""Stinker"" halves was incredibly well done -- at risk of sacrilege I would say even better than in the books.  And the way the realtionship and similarities between him and Frodo were played up was a good touch.
There were several departures from the book but only one that really bothered me (and bothered everyone who was at the midnight show I went to):  What they did to Faramir was just wrong and annoying.  I think maybe I have some idea why they did it, but, well, they just shouldn't have.
Other than that, the only flaw in this movie was that for about the first third of it much of the dialogue was very hard to understand, particularly the growly effects voices.  I'll need to see ""Towers"" again (as if I wouldn't anyway) just to pick up what I missed the first time around.
_The Two Towers_ is quite long -- a little over three hours by my clock -- but it never suffers from drag.  I enjoyed every minute (Except the Faramir bits).  This is one great movie!  I'm counting the minutes until the DVD comes out and the days until _Return of the King_!",1040169600,23,3288,4.505902192242833
1471631,5,B00005JKZU,"If you didn't like the first movie then don't go, because you won't like this movie.
I was worried because some reviewers were trashing this movie on television. I went with a friend and watched the movie at the Mall of Georgia on Dec. 17 11:59pm. Overall, I thought the movie was really good and actually better than the prequel, in my opinion.
There is a lot of action and really cool battle scenes. They have a lot of humor to relieve some of the tension. This movie is pretty long (3 hours). Typically, I don't get moved (swept up) by the movie. The sound and music in the movie is awesome. The special effects, acting, etc. are excellent. Contrary to rumors, the movie doesn't drag or lag action! The movie has a pretty fast pace. NOTE I'M NOT A FANATIC FOR LOTR SERIES.
Even if you have read the book, the movie will be entertaining and different but still true to books. What more could you ask for? By the way, the books are excellent. Surprise, Surprise! They are well written. The only problem is all the names and etc. can bog you down.
Back to the movie, the only controversial thing will about the trees. I'm nuetral on them. They didn't make or break it, so the movie was still great despite them. It works out better in a book than a movie.
Anyways, it a great movie. It's worth the admission price alone. My friend just watched both of them yesterday, and he said that he like them both and wanted to watch the third installment. Hope that helps.",1040169600,,1462,4.3786764705882355
1471632,5,B00005JKZU,"I have just returned from a 12:01 am first screening of Peter Jackson's second installment in the Lord of the Rings Saga.  So how was it?
It is clear we are in the midst of a milestone of cinema.  The Two Towers is every bit as stunning, overwhelming, moving and spectacular as its predecessor -- while being a completely different movie altogether.  FOTR was an adventure movie infused with a sense of wonder and awe.  It's major theme was loyalty.  The Two Towers is a war epic with a much darker and more frantic tone.  If there is a theme, it is about courage and hope in the face of overwhelming evil.
(very minor spoilers ahead)
We start off right where FOTR left off -- the Fellowship scattered.  Merry and Pippin have been abducted by Orcs.  Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas are persuing.  Their journey puts them in the path of Saruman, who is massing an army at his fortress to attack the nation of Rohan -- one of the powers on the side of good. But Rohan's king Theoden is old and sick and can not resist. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo continue their quest to destroy the Ring of Power with an unexpected ally -- Gollum, the pathetic creature that once owned the Ring for 500 years.
This is movie-making the way it should be -- grand, majestic, almost monstrous in its power.  The vistas are grand, the characters strong, the visuals stunning, the direction crisp, the dialogue splendid.  There's not a single bad line or bad scene.  And there are many that simply overpower the viewer.  I'm going to need to see this a second and third time just to take everything in.
Highlights?  The final 45 minutes, which feature three simultaneous battles, makes Star Wars 2 look like a kid's video game.  The character of Theoden, King of Rohan, is splendily realized in the script as a man who yearns for glory while fearing he is too old to achieve it.  He is magnificently acted by Bernard Hill.
But the highlight of this movie is Gollum -- a creature corrupted and twisted by the Ring, his psych split down the middle with both love and hatred for it.  In him, you see the creature Frodo might one day become.  His CG character is amazingly realized and powerfully acted by Andy Serkis -- who deserves an academy award for his portrayal.  As my girlfriend said:  This is Gollum's movie.
My principle objection to the movie?  It's too short.  It is rushed.  I can see another Special Edition coming.  And it's not followed immediately by Return of the King.
For those of you have read the book, the movie parts significantly from the text but not in any objectionable way and not in any manner that alters the storyline.  It ends a few chapters before the book.  And Tolkien's vision is amazing realized.  I thought that the Ents would be comical.  Instead, they looked amazing.  Through skillful combination of CGI, models and bluescreen work, this movie is a seamless and perfect rendering of middle Earth.",1040169600,,2903,4.58252427184466
1471633,5,B00005JKZU,"Fun and action packed.  True Tolkein fans beware... as with the first movie, several things from the story are excluded (to be expected) however, a few major things are added... curious decicsions on Jackson's part.  If one can forgive the liberties taken by the creative team, then you will truly enjoy this movie (some will NOT forgive... to each their own).
Legolas fans will rejoice, however Gimli fans may be disappointed at his ""demotion"" to comic relief. Fans of the book will know that he is a much more competent warrior than the movie portrays.  Still, he does have the best comic lines in the movie.  It might have been a good idea to reveal that he actually WINS that little competition he has with Legolas.  Again, a little forgiveness on behalf of the audience will prevent this from ruining the movie in a grand sense.
Gollum is well done, as are the Ents.  The story of the ring kind of takes a back seat to the battle at Helm's Deep, however that is probably more Tolkein's design.
Lots and lots of stand-up-and-cheer moments... mostly in the later half of the movie.  The Eowyn-Aragorn-Arwen triangle adds rich drama on an emotional level, even though the chemistry has been tweaked somewhat.

1471634,5,B00005JKZU,"I attended a midnight showing of the Two Towers last night and found that it was worth the night without sleep.
This movie doesn't need a lot of description.  Quality is consistant from the last picture, which is to be expected since they were all made at once.  The Graphics were very good.  The special effects awsome (love those ents)  The sound quality in the theater was poor, (of course it could just be that I was tired) but I'll see it again with the kids and judge it properly then.
Golumn does his best to steal the show.  The Character is great and is acted well.  I say Acted because Andy Serkis voice and movements that the graphics were put over were vital to the character.  I tended to feel more and more sorry for the character, particularly since Frodo was moving in the same direction.  Great Job by wood.
I think the decision to make Gimli a comic character hurt and I would have liked to see more of the interplay between him and Legolas. (perhaps in the extended version) It was the films only weakness.
Easily the best movie of the year.  It is almost high art.  The Godfather is high art, Star Wars is not, however this movie moves toward that direction.  The final movie will confirm it.
The story is rife with symbols of the modern earth shaking events taking place now.  Those who believe in coincidence and who follow current events must be amazed.  I don't belive in coincidence so I am not.  From the rising of the Ents to the turning of Thoden, (war is upon you if you like it or not)the parallels are astounding.  Many will miss it, some will do their best to ignore it but the message of these two (soon to be three) movies at this time, speaks to an age the message it needs to hear.  The makers and the actors deny this, but they are ring bearers like it or no.",1040169600,,1796,4.316417910447761

For many reasons was this sequel excellent, but it comes down to three main things:
1) It is based on the excellent work of J.R.R. Tolkien
2) It expresses the themes of the book very well.
3) It is more open, in my opinion, for the public.
1) Being hailed as the best book of the 20th Century, The Lord of the Rings has been often cited as the beginning of modern fantasy. Bringing its readers into a world which is, at the same time, fantastic and realistic, the story expresses themes of hope and faith as well as some really good characters. Thus, since the film is well-adapted to match the book in many ways (making a few adaptations to shorten the length as well as make the story flow better on the screen), it is excellent just as the book itself is excellent.
2) The themes of both hope (and hopelessness at times) are expressed well in this movie. Also, through cunning development of Gollum, the theme that good can prevail within a (seemingly) completely corrupt individual is expressly shown.
3) In my opinion, The Two Towers is more accessible to the public. Once you get past all the names in the movie, the plot is relatively easy to follow even if you have not read the books. However, the thing that lightens the mood, which is often needed for viewers who are not ""hard-core"" fantasy/Tolkien fans is the comic relief that is often inserted. The movie is often very dark, so the film is at some times extremely dreary. However, throughout the movie, there are other areas of light humor which help lighten the mood which often helps non-fanatics.
So in the end, The Two Towers gets 5 out of 5. I HIGHLY suggest seeing this movie!",1040169600,,1968,4.5
1471636,5,B00005JKZU,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a near perfect adaptation of Tolkien's novel (in spirit more than in its structure), the first volume in The Lord of the Rings ""trilogy"" (though Tolkien himself designed it as one long book, but that's neither here nor there where the movies are concerned). Peter Jackson brought Middle-Earth to life, and maintained the emotional content of Tolkien's work as well as the adventure and spectacle. With The Two Towers, though, Peter Jackson is less successful on all grounds. The movie is neither as true to its written counterpart as the previous film, nor does it leave a sparkling aftertaste when the credits roll. For some reason, Peter Jackson decided to cut the content of The Two Towers in half for his film adaptation, only to attach it next year to the beginning of The Return of the King. For example, if you're an avid fan of Tolkien (and by God you should be!), you'll notice that Shelob is absent in film two, and so are many other events. Now, that's not to say they got the ole Glorfindel axe -not at all. Shelob will appear in film three, and so will all of the other important events that got lopped out of The Two Towers.
In Mr. Jackson's defense, I must add that the structure of his film would make another climax such as Shelob's a little too much to handle - I mean, after all, we've already been through Helm's Deep in all its glory. However, if Jackson had restructured his screenplay, it could have played out more like Tolkien's novel - and been the better for it... and I'm not speaking strictly as a Tolkien zealot here either. Despite the film's virtual three hours of running time, Jackson manages to deliver an ending that feels somehow rushed. It is certainly not a satisfactory conclusion that will leave you beaming. Instead, you'll be groaning and whining, ""That's it? Another year?"" I know that a cliffhanger was something of a given, but The Two Towers, as adapted by Jackson, doesn't complete a satisfying story arch the way he managed with The Fellowship of the Ring (and in flying colors, I hasten to add!). It can't help but be a little disappointing given this. I really wish Jackson hadn't made his fateful decision to saw The Two Towers down the middle.
Does this mean I'm not a fan of The Two Towers? Not by a long shot - I'm only saying that the The Fellowship of the Ring is more gratifying as a whole, and that it's a tough act to follow. My list of praises for The Two Towers is lengthy indeed! To begin with, Gollum is, without question, exactly how he should be. Not only does Gollum seem very real and alive (he's computer-generated), but his behavior is dead on. Gollum is as tragic in the film as he is on the written page, and the behind-the-FX performance is haunting and worthy of limitless honor. Just looking at Gollum evokes feelings of pity for the poor lost soul.
All of the performances in The Two Towers are amazing, though. The characterizations are also much nearer to Tolkien's. Gimli was mere comic relief in film 1, for example, but he shines in film 2 - and, yes, he's still very funny too, but it all feels a little more appropriate. Add to this some amazing action segments, some dazzling visual effects (much better than the lacking effects in part 1), and sometimes verbatim dialogue from Tolkien himself, and you have a movie that is exciting and dramatic both at once (just like The Lord of the Rings should be, after all!). If only the film had adhered to Tolkien's book as strictly near the end as it did at the outset... Alas!
The first portion of The Two Towers is a Ringer dream come true. I dare say, in fact, that the first hour of film 2 is even more true to its source material than the first hour of film 1. This was a bit misleading, because, soon enough, Jackson's liberties begin to creep in - and they're not all bad, nor are they far from the Tolkien spirit. Still, there are a few inexcusable offenses. The first, and most severe, is the film's structure, as I've mentioned, which makes a mess of what happens in which installment of the tale. The second major offense comes in the form of the elves at Helm's Deep - and I'm not moaning just because there at elves at Helm's Deep either. What I really have a problem with is Jackson's callous slaying of a Tolkien character who, however unimportant in the grand scheme of things, did not actually die in the novels. Some minor quibbles include Gandalf's lack of screen time despite his ""resurrection,"" and the Merry and Pippin moments which seem to be more of an afterthought than anything else. They were not given the proper amount of attention by the filmmakers, who preferred instead to throw a lot of unimportant Arwen sequences our way.
All in all, The Two Towers is no Fellowship of the Ring, but what it does well, it does exceedingly well. It just feels too much like a story that was cut in half - which, essentially, is exactly what it is. As a Tolkien fanatic as well as an avid moviegoer, I object to this. Still, when all three films are completed, none of these niggles will seem as troublesome. It's the desire for more that lead to much of my disappointment in the conclusion, after all.",1040169600,2,5176,4.513312034078807
1471637,5,B00005JKZU,"The Two Towers is going to be awesome; no doubt!!!
Why?  Well here are a few reasons from the Ragin' Cajun herself:
1)  Legolas is in it!
2)  The characters don't change their style, looks, or behavior because TTT was shot right after FOTR!
3)  All three movies were shot very true to the book.
4)  And finally, LEGOLAS IS IN IT!!!  :-)

To all the pods that had something to say about the ending I got one word for you: TRILOGY.
The Towers will be even better as story progresses and the rythem really picks up.
Anyone who critisizes the movies can try and imagine of how he would make this one better- NOT!

1471739,5,B00005JKZU,"Alright, I know I'm once again breaking the rules by writing a review for the trailor instead of the movie, but in my defense I'm not the only one impatiently awaiting the next installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and if Amazon.com didn't want input before the movie's release, then they wouldn't have this webpage up! Anyway, if you don't find my review for the brand new trailor helpful, I hope at least that you find it interesting.
The brand new trailor, not yet shown in theatres, once again got my heart pumping due to the incredible amount of new scenes, new dialouge and new characters that were held within it. It's much better put together than the first trailor which was a bit clumsy and choppy (as some reviewers have noted) but this new one can be found at the official sight and I strongly advise heading down there to download it.
It begins much as the preview did, with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas on the hunt for the captured Merry and Pippen - only in this one they are stopped by the Riders of Rohan and we get our first good look at Eomer who questions them on their presence suspiciously, but sends them on their way (and all of this filmed practically on my backdoor!) It moves to include shots of Merry and Pippen in the orc's imcampment and Frodo and Sam descending into the Emyn Muil who comment on their lack of direction. With all the broken Fellowship accounted for, it immediatly launches into shots of other characters.
Many include furthering the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen - there are many shots of them together and Elrond sternly telling Aragorn - ""Our time here is ending. Arwen's time is ending. Let her go"" and telling Arwen - ""There is nothing for you here, only death."" There is certainly pressure on them to part ways, but Arwen quietly answers her father -""There is still hope,"" even after Elrond predicts that Aragorn will not return. Purists at this point may be concerned at these extensive love scenes, none of which appear in the book, but let me explain: although there are rumours that Arwen appears at Helm's Deep, we can be fairly certain this is *not* true. Instead the elves abandon Rivendell for the Grey Havens(there is a beautiful shot of their departure in the trailor) and Arwen takes the still un-forged Shards of Narsil with her.
But the trailor doesn't focus solely on the love story - along with Eomer there are many scenes of Eowyn and the much anticipated Bernard Hill as King Theoden, who is being conselled by Gandalf and Aragorn to prepare for war. He is reluctant, but much of the dialouge includes talk of the Uruk-Hai and their purpose to wipe out the world of men. Theoden declares: ""I will not risk open war!"" and Aragorn replies: ""Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not."" Eowyn to gets some good scenes - Theoden orders her to led the refugees from Rohan, we see her looking quite feminine at one stage and there is an intriguing scene with her and Aragorn where she asks him - ""Who is she? The one who gave you that jewel?"" It would seem Peter Jackson is heightening the love triangle between Aragorn, Eowyn and Arwen, though for better or worse remains to be seen.
And thankfully, there is more of Frodo and Sam. There was very little of them in all previous previews for the Two Towers, but here there are some very VERY amazing scenes of them struggling with Gollum and appointing him as their guide through Mordor; Frodo brandishing a sword; Frodo falling face-first to the ground (possibly fainting?) and Sam crying out that the Ring ""is taking hold of you!"" (P.S. thanks to the reviewers who wrote in explaining Frodo's role in the next book, but all I meant in my previous review was that there was surprising little of him in the *preview* - I assume because his journey through Mordor isn't as visually exciting as the rest of character's travels).
Now brace yourselves, as the last portion of the trailor picks up speed, and to incredible music flashes through scenes of: the blazing eye of Sauron atop Barad-dur; an awe-inspiring shot of the orc legions; Saruman and Wormtongue; fleeting but clear glimpses of the Wargs; an ent swooping down and lifting Merry off his feet; an oliphaunt; tantalising glimpses of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog; Shadowfax; battle sequences on horseback; Gandalf's return to the three hunters; and more of incredible battle at Helm's Deep. Track this trailor down - you won't be sorry, as it adds even more exicitement for December!
From the trailor - ""The Fellowship has broken...the Power of Darkness Grows...All Will Be Sacrificed...All Will Be Lost...Unless All Unite Against Evil...""

1471740,5,B00005JKZU,"The movie will jump back and forth from book 3 to 4, and Shelob is being pushed back to the third film and it looks as if part of book 5 will be in this film > It does make sense when you understand that Frodo was at Cirith Gorgor chapter 3 of book 4 while Gandalf was at Isengard with Saruman chapter 10 of book 3 >",1030233600,,316,3.661764705882353
1471741,5,B00005JKZU,"'The Two Towers' may even be more anticipated than the Fellowship.  How is that possible?  Well take a look at the trailor if ou have any doubts.  Especially after the events of Sept. 11 the title is even more eery than what Tolkien could have ever imagined.  When I first read the novel I thought to myself, 'how are they going to pull this off?'  Well they did it with imagination, determination and creativity.  Holding the perfect scenery and costum design, this movie captured the spirit of middle earth in one of its most perilous moments. Death in darkness and hope in light seemed to be a recurruing theme through-out the battle scenes and on Frodo's journey.  But the charater who stole the show was Brad Dourif's Wormtounge.  He was creepy to look and and he held the essence of his character in his pocket with grace and malignancy.  I know that this movie will surpass all expectations as it delivers an unreal world with real visions and dialogue.  The detail is more than enthralling, it is overwhelming at its worst.  The new characters introduced in the second chapter push the story to new hights, developing intertwining conflicts and subterfuge through-out a story of death, life, good, evil and everything in between.  An amalgan of emotions dives the viewer into a unpresidented sense of absorbtion following not just the actors,but the colors, the scenery, the costum, the music and the life begotten from pain and suffering in an attempt to minimalise the push of Sauron's power.  See it, see it four times, it will inspire you with each passing.",1029974400,10,1569,4.788104089219331
1471742,5,B00005JKZU,"Okay, I am basically a Tolkien geek, but I still keep my cool... I have read the whole trilogy twice and almost done with the first two books for the third time. I know quite a bit about what the movie will be like basing it on the book. Jackson stayed basically to the book when making the Fellowship of the Ring, so he should for The Two Towers. Yes, there are some things that he had to take out of FOTR such as Bombadil and Gildor and the Exiles, but did he have a choice? Watching the special features on the FOTR DVD, I noticed that Jackson said that everyone always had said that these amazing classics could never be made into a movie. The world of Middle Earth was too large. Well, here Jackson is, an avid Tolkien fan, and he is determined to find a way. Everyone was right... there is no possible way to fit EVERYTHING into ONE movie... so Jackson fit what he could into THREE movies. The Two Towers is massive compared to FOTR, and the movie will be the same. There is more action for war-buffs, more romance for people like me, more mystery fo those who like suspense. This is a movie telling of the journey, rather than one that draws a picture of the characters which was the purpose of FOTR. Here you meet important people, such as omer and owyn and Thoden. In the second half, you meet Faramir & Smagol/Gollum. How can you add that many more MAIN charactors and NOT have a HUGE movie? Compared to The Two Towers, the FOTR was slow and boring. This will be a movie to remember, with one amazing battle scene, an amazing hunt, wonderful new creatures, new characters, and a whole lot of class. I thought i would mention to ravenya that most of the book is about Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli and Merry & Pippen. Frodo and Sam don't come in until the second half of the book, which makes for an interesting question of how will Jackson do the seperate books? Will he and do every other scene, or every two scenes (by scenes i mean like chapters of the book) or will he actually have just two halves, and the end of the first half is an ending of the movie? Just a thought to ponder. Here's a sum of all this babble :-) The Two Towers will be a massive movie, both in scale, and in the box office. It is a movie that has something for everyone, from action to romance to mystery. This will be a must see when it comes out.",1029974400,3,2333,4.221476510067114

7939053,5,B00005JKZU,"I didn't have a deep connection with LOTR until it was revealed in 2016 just how corrupted, widespread and impregnable the establishment of Washington DC had become. It has been earth-shaking to see how career politicians along with the hierarchy of the intelligence community have been working hand in hand with the mainstream media to overturn a Presidential Election. How could this be happening in the USA? Over the last few years I have seen true evil that I had never experienced before. The worst part is the helplessness of watching it all happen. I've never understood the true reality of what helplessness feels like. Now I feel that connection with the essence of Tolkien's story- the fear of helplessness and the means of overcoming an enemy so great and powerful. LOTR always seemed too clichd before. It was the same old story of good triumphing over evil. But now that I've experienced the Washington Establishment and mainstream media and felt their malicious power I understand the existence of how hard it is to rise up and defeat something so huge. I understand how average people are scared to act because of their striking vulnerability. We literally have black-masked villains threatening groups who want to stand against the establishment. This would've never seemed possible to me years ago. I would've mistakenly presumed that people in the US wouldn't stand for corruption. But now I see how it's a person's vulnerability that keeps them from acting. To actually rise up and fight takes so much more than I ever thought possible. Because of these things LOTR has become a major inspiration for me. Whereas before I saw it as too grand and clichd, now I see it as the perfect portrayal. The whole idea comes down to good people finding their courage and coming together to defeat evil. It's a clich, but it has become real again.",1525737600,,1854,4.870253164556962
