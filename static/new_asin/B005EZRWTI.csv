8469362,5,B005EZRWTI,"English is a 2nd or 3rd language for His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
Anyone who has attended Tibetan teachings understand this. This is NOT a problem for most people.
I have studied with His Holiness and I think this is one of the very best presentations on emotions I have seen by His Holiness.
