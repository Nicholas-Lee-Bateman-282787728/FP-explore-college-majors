1061603,5,6305661707,"This video is great for beginners. The instructor, Alan Finger, provides good guidance, introduces each posture gently, uses humor effectively, and encourages students. I find the combination of his soothing voice and the instructions he give out before and during each posture very effective.  While most of the asanas shown are at an introductory level, there are some that are challenging as well, so that even those who have been practicing yoga for a considerable amount of time already will find this a good alternative for the more intensive sessions. The sequence of postures ensure that the whole body is exercised.  The postures are demonstrated by two senior yoga instructors, one of whom does the modified forms, and two students (Alan Finger's wife and his friend).  Overall, the video is excellent for beginners, but if there's one thing to complain about, it's the length of time of the savasana with Alan Finger guiding you through the final posture.",1087516800,5,966,5.10126582278481
1061604,5,6305661707,"I developed an interest in trying yoga about a month ago and decided to pick up this video. I'm so glad I did, because it's been such a great video that I now do yoga every single day, doing this video specifically at least 4 or 5 times a week.
The instructor's voice is very soothing and relaxing, and the poses are challenging but definitely not unattainable for the beginner. What's more, there's always room to grow. When I started to feel like I really had a pose down and might feel bored by that section of the video, instead I started really examining the pose to see how I felt, or noticing that I could be relaxing a particular part of my body more, or breathing better. Someone else in these reviews mentioned that they felt bored during the explanations if they'd done the video a while -- what I've begun to do is simply start doing the pose while he's explaining. I get more workout that way and I'm growing in my ability to do it.
I highly recommend this video for any beginner interested in yoga.",1065744000,17,1012,4.35978835978836
1061605,5,6305661707,"I first discovered yoga in the late 70's when I had the good fortune to learn from a teacher who had studied with a bona fide yoga master from India.  That was long ago and far away and soon afterwards I moved to New York City.  Due to the hurly burly of trying to get established and live here, my yoga practice gradually slipped away.
I have made several attempts to rekindle my initial enthusiam by purchasing over a dozen books and videos and taking numerous classes.  Up until I saw this video, I had failed to find anything that replicated the quality of the instruction I first experienced.
It is unfortunate that two prior reviewers of this tape called it ""boring"" and one went over the top and panned everything about it, ending the review by citing preferred videos made by people in the fitness industry.
First of all, if anyone finds this video boring, I suggest the problem may not be with the video but rather the person.  Even though now there are many styles of yoga to choose from (Bikram, Kundalini, Ashtanga, Kripalu, Iyengar, and so forth)--and I have tried several of these--the fact remains that classical hatha yoga is supposed to be slow, deliberate, precise, meditative and mindful.  Anything that deviates from that is usually some bastardization of it.  I once took a yoga class from a local high-quality health club and the instructor never once even went over the proper way to breathe, never made reference to the mind-body discipline of it and the hour passed as nothing more than a stretching class.
Now that yoga has gone mainstream in these intervening 20 or so years since I first discovered it, there are a lot of people out there teaching it who obviously have no business doing so.  It seems that every celebrity and fitness guru has a book or video out on it and there is nothing that authenticates these people as qualified to teach it other than their names.
Don't get me wrong, I am not a yoga expert, I still consider myself a beginner, but I can recognize excellent instruction when I see it.  Alan Finger is all a yoga teacher should be--he teaches the proper breath and form throughout.  He is gentle, slow and tells you where every every toe, arm and vertebra should be.  He is thorough, exacting and precise:  since yoga is not some new phenomenon of pop culture but an ancient art and science, his manner of instruction recognizes that and dignifies it as such.  I am so inspired and impressed with him that I would lay out all the extra money it would take, and schlep all the way down to the other end of this city, if I thought I could study at his studio with the man himself.  Trust me, this is a quality video.  All the superlatives apply.",996883200,202,2694,4.539256198347108
1061606,5,6305661707,This is the first yoga video I have purchased and it won't be the last.  This is an excellent video for anyone who is just starting out with yoga and it is easy to follow even the first time through.  Alan Finger is very soothing and relaxing as he tells you not to push further than you can go.  Yoga isn't just for human pretzels anymore!  Even performing modified poses gives a good workout for both mind and body.  I worked up a sweat and then had the best night's sleep in a long time.  I highly recommend this video to anyone!,992131200,2,532,4.166666666666667
1061607,4,6305661707,"GREAT!  I had bought the introduction to yoga book, but was not sure if I was doing the postures correctly.  The video helped me to understand correct Yoga breathing, and gave me confidence that I was doing Yoga correctly.  While the tape does not have a lot of postures, it taught me enough that I can now do all the postures in my book with confidence.  I have already recommended this tape and the intro to Yoga book by Yoga Zone to family and friends.  It is relaxing and I can see an improvement in my upper body strength.",971568000,8,527,4.282828282828283

After 4 months of use, I'd say this video and the others in the set are an excellent choice for those new to yoga.  Instructor Alan Finger's pleasant voice gives clear, encouraging, and  careful direction from move to move, and the three yoga practioners with  him perform at different flexibility levels, so you won't feel intimidated  by advanced pretzel maneuvers.  The production quality is first rate, and  the accompanying music is pleasant and unobtrusive.  I'm grateful for such  a positive first yoga experience, and I highly recommend this video and the  other 3 Yoga Zone videos in the set.  Enjoy!",946512000,125,706,4.75206611570248

I have been doing yoga for 20+ years and got my first Yoga Zone videos somewhere, early on in there, while living overseas and without access to yoga classes.

I love these dvds. I upgraded to dvds about 12 years ago, and even now, with access to lessons with a real face to face yoga instructor, I still revert to yoga zone because the explanation of breathing technique and posture is unsurpassed.

In the video there is emphasis on going at your own pace and modifications are offered. And, how to move toward not using the modifications, if you're physically able.

1061881,5,6305661707,"I used to wake up religiously at 4:00am to watch Yoga Zone back in the early 90's on Direct TV.  I learned a lot about yoga from watching Alan Finger host the Yoga Zone Show.  Alan Finger is probably the best Yoga teacher I have ever had and although I learned from watching this television show, I also took more advanced classes later in life, but always return back to the Yoga Zone series to get back into reiterating the pose into my head or even teaching others about how to incorporate yoga into their lives. I am 48 years old, but have many senior citizen friends that I highly recommend this beginning DVD to.  Yoga Zone Beginners truly helped me incorporate yoga into my life effortlessly.

I used to own this on VHS, but wore it out. This truly is the best yoga instruction film I have ever seen.  It is a great gift for senior citizens, anyone who suffers from arthritis, and anyone who really, truly, hates to exercise, but knows they have to do something to get their body back into shape.  It helped me graduate into the advanced yoga poses.  I highly recommend this DVD.  The accompanying music is very cool.",1368748800,6,1124,4.4487804878048784
1061882,5,6305661707,"I use this DVD the most because it starts slow and has multiple people doing the positions at different skill levels.

1061883,5,6305661707,"I previously owned a vhs version of this which became damaged so I replaced it with this DVD.  I find this so helpful as a beginner who is not that flexible.  I use it to supplement 1/2 marathon training (walking not running). I find using it tones muscles and improves my posture by making me aware of correct posture.  It helps my breathing for swimming as well. Over time the improvement in fitness in breathing, flexibility, toning, balance and posture becomes very noticeable for me.  A lapse in consistent use also becomes noticeable in these areas of fitness! I like being able to progress at my own pace in the privacy of my home. Being a member of the more mature population, I find it works for me.",1357689600,4,708,4.5078125

1061885,5,6305661707,"I'm in my early 50s, very out of shape, with a lower back condition that will never go away. My doctor suggested I take up yoga. A freind recommended Alan Finger's DVDs to me--I really like this one. Mr. Finger's instructions are very concise and easy to follow. He is very encouraging to those of us who are less flexible--saying to be careful, that we will become more flexible eventually. He gives precise instructions on how to simplify a poise and why. I am sore, which is natural, but I have not injured myself--this is due to Mr. Finger's careful instructions.

I have only done this video routine for a week, but already feel better and have noticed a difference in my flexibility. The calming effects of yoga are nice as well.",1350518400,7,735,4.568181818181818

This is one of my first yoga instructions and I have tried others only to find myself in severe pain after the fact. His instruction is very complete, after you have done it a few times, you rarely have to look up at the TV, which hurts your neck anyways. He also demonstrates modified poses for the less flexible. I have found his techniques are wonderful and low impact. I feel amazing and pain free when I'm done. I highly recommend this instruction for beginners and novice.

My entire body has been stretched out and I worked up a little sweat as well.  Alan Finger explains in detail what to do, how you should be feeling and how and when to breath in and out.  As a beginner, I truly appreciate his way of teaching Yoga.  I've tried other yoga tapes and honestly they don't compare. You cannot know if you're doing it right in most cases.  Even other beginner tapes are not as clear as Alan Finger, and some of them make you try dangerous poses, well not this one.  You can be very out of shape and do this one.  You only go as far into the poses as you can go, and he tells you so the whole way through.

This is a slow paced practice that gives you an excellent foundation and helps you really understand proper alignment.  Unlike some ""beginner"" dvd's, the average person who has never done a yoga pose in their life can do this dvd because of the very precise and detailed instruction.

Using this DVD as a foundation to beginning my yoga practice has allowed me to do so many other yoga dvd's that are great workouts but perhaps lacking a bit in the instructional side.  Alan Finger is very motivating and guides you through the best relaxations at the end.  I find that although he talks through them nearly the entire time, I can actually relax better into them than in other dvd's shavasana's where my mind tends to wander.

Alan Finger explains the poses clearly and goes at a gentle pace, making it accessible for beginners yet even more experienced yogis as myself will still learn from it and enjoy the practice. Unlike many other videos I've seen which either rush at a hectic pace or bore us with endless talking and no movement, this video flows nicely allowing participants to feel confident in knowing they are doing the poses safely and correctly while getting a great yoga class filled with a variety of poses and stretches.  Once you are comfortable with this video I recommend trying Yoga Journal's Intro to Yoga series, which is a little more advanced.

Allan Fingers offers very detailed and precise instructions each time I listen to it, I get additional hints and tips.

The program is rather quick paced and ends with an excellent guided relaxation.

After following the video several times and learning the sequence I prefer to do it without the DVD and take long time in the positions.

An amusing aspect of the video is that Allan Finger chose some extraordinarily sexy looking models, ""senior yoga instructors"",  and the camera-person is at times dwelling on the sexy aspects of these ""senior instructors"" just a tad too long...
Due to this, some of my women friends found the video offensive (perhaps they felt intimidated by these young and sexy as the models).

I highly recommend this program, it does not require any previous knowledge of yoga positions while at the same time, ever very advanced practitioners loved it.",1188259200,3,910,4.953947368421052

There is one extra stretch position and the order of the movements is switched around once or twice, but other than that it's the same.  Alan Finger even says some of the same lines.  (I suppose that's inevitable, after doing dozens of shows and videos). In fact, Flexibility and Tone feels more 'thorough'.  That workout leaves you feeling like you really did something, whereas this one leaves you feeling unchallenged and wondering if you just wasted an hour.  I'm glad this is really inexpensive these days.

1062070,5,6305661707,"I need to stress that I really loathe any form of physical exercises. However, after having two babies, being completely out of shape, feeling constantly tried, and having to suffer very strained and sore back almost daily, I know I need a remedy for good. Ever since I was no longer able to visit my chiropractor on a weekly basis, my back has gone further and further out of adjustment and is really starting to negatively impact my emotional health as well. Then I purchased this DVD after reading the reviews here and skeptically tried the whole routine (about 1 hour) at first viewing.

The next day, though my back was still sore, I was not experiencing sharp pain anymore. This was my first experience with the DVD. I felt pretty good for a couple of days and the pain came back. Then two weeks went by without trying to do the exercises. My back was hurting me so much that it was causing me stomachaches. (I know it sounds odd but not so in reality since our body parts are very much linked).

I finally broke down and did the yoga exercises yesterday. I started to feel better half way through it and by the end of the routine, I was so relaxed that I was sound asleep on the floor! I repeated the exercises at night the second time. Today, I have very minor, dull pain in my back but I feel so much more energized and light!

One more thing I need to mention is that: though I am very much inclined to seek alternative/ homeopathic/ holistic, etc... form of healing, I dislike the new-age-ish garbage that sometimes goes along with this community. I was afraid that I'll be watching some ugly, long-haired weirdo chanting a foreign language, preaching new age spirituality while trying to teach yoga. The instructor, Alan Finger, did none of that. He is very much a gentleman, likable, humorous, and though long-haired, he's not at all ugly and weird. His descriptions of the breathing technique and the poses are clear and concise. His constant remainder and emphasis on completing the breathing while attempting the various poses are a tremendous help to a beginner, both in yoga and exercises in general.

Anyway, I hope my clumsily put together review actually goes to show how much I've benefited from this DVD and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the healing power of yoga.",1156464000,23,2324,4.606280193236715

This is a gentle beginning yoga program that, at the same time, is challenging for those of us who are very out of shape or have never done yoga.  Alan Finger is a very low key instructor who does not get into the viewer's face, but at the same time succeeds in giving clear and thorough instruction for each pose.

Anyone who finds this program boring just doesn't understand the nature of this style of yoga. If you have never done yoga before, or if you are accustomed to power yoga, you need to understand that there are different styles of yoga. This style of yoga is done is a slow, almost contemplative style that concentrates on correct form and on breathing. If you do the postures correctly, you can spend a lifetime doing them and still find small adjustments to make every time you do the posture. The object of this type of yoga is to assume the posture, and make small corrections to your posture while also concentrating on your breathing. The goal is to occupy the mind with the minutiae of correct posture and breathing so that the mind is stilled and the practitioner is immersed in the present, rather than letting your mind run on about other things. This is not a simple exercise, even for the simplest posture. If you are bored, it's because you are not doing it right, plain and simple.",1142553600,14,1568,4.514084507042254

1062073,5,6305661707,"I recently purchased the four VHS version of Yoga Zone's Beginner Series. Just moments ago I finished doing this introductory program for the first time. While I am far from being a beginner and have been practicing daily for 9 years (w/ over 90 Yoga programs and years of instruction w/ a great teacher,)  I still enjoy doing programs like this now and then. Today I was looking to do a gentle practice on the longer side so it was a perfect program.

 I have many other Yoga Zone programs and really enjoy Alan Finger's teaching. He is a true master teacher whose father (and teacher)Mani Finger learned from a lineage of authentic Indian masters.

 This program is great on so many levels. First, the detailed instruction is great for someone who is a beginner or someone who has more experience but wants to keep refining their practice. The sequence of poses work your body gently and thoroughly through a wide range of motion (I feel amazing right now having just done it). It starts seated, then moves to all fours (cat, down dog etc), to standing postures, back to seated (twists, forward bends) and finishes lying in Savasana. The length of the program (55 minutes) lets you really take your time with each posture and really breathe into all the areas of tension that need to be released.

 There are four other ""students"" demonstrating the postures, with one showing modifications throughout.

 I am a big fan of Alan Finger's teaching because I find him to be detailed enough without ever becoming tedious. Even after 9 years of daily practice I found his instructions to be helpful reminders of subtle details which one can never master too well.

 Highly recommended!

1062074,5,6305661707,"I have never done Yoga in my life. I had considered on a couple occasions joining a Yoga class, but decided I would rather learn a little in the privacy of my home first.  I am so glad I bought this DVD. After the first time doing it, I already loved it!  For an absolute beginner like me, some of the positions are a little difficult to hold for any amount of time. But there is no problem in following along and understanding what you should be doing. I found Alan Finger to be a wonderful instructor. He explains the positions very well and always stresses to make sure you are breathing. His voice is very calming, which helped me remain relaxed throughout the video.  After doing this video, I feel completely relaxed! I really think this a great choice for a beginner!  I  also purchased the Yoga Zone Conditioning and Stess Relief DVD along with this one and am looking very forward to trying that one too!",1132012800,19,913,4.410714285714286
1062075,5,6305661707,"I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind.

I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the practice.  I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more.

I highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there.",1122595200,17,1226,4.095833333333333
1062076,5,6305661707,"I took a yoga class many years ago. I still remember how delightfully flexible I was and how peaceful I felt. Now a working mother with all the challenges and stresses we all feel from day to day, I yearned to recapture that feeling.

Though I walk on a treadmill for 30-45 minutes every day, I knew that my muscles weren't what they were in my twenties so I thought it best to start with a beginning video. I am happy with my decision to do so.

This video is an excellent starting point for someone beginning yoga, or someone like me who yearned to return to it. The instructor's voice is soothing and guides you through each posture coaching the location and tension of each muscle through entire postures - a very important key to yoga.

Though the video is 55 minutes long, it most definitely doesn't feel so long. There were no tedious moments. My mind didn't wander from what I was doing to the inevitable stresses of work and daily life - your mind and body really do become one. At the end of the session there is a calming relaxation portion - the hallmark of any good yoga program.

One more thing I liked about this video - there were four individuals doing poses at alternating levels. If you are still not as flexible as you would like to be, you can follow the lesser version of the posture demonstrated by one person on the screen. As you attain greater flexibility you can pose with the member demonstrating the most complex version of the pose. In short, you can individualize this yoga session to suit your own fitness level.

I highly recommend this video for all of the reasons stated above. You can learn and grow with it and attain tighter muscles and a more peaceful mind.",1093132800,35,1696,4.440514469453376
