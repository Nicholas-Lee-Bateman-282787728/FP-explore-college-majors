8118277,5,B000F6ZEFK,"I also saw this movie as a teenager when it first was released and I never forgot the courage of young Peter Gottfried. I remember a character saying that the only way to survive as a Christian in East Germany was to be like a radish - red, but only on the outside.  A few years later, I got to serve as a Mormon missionary in a beautiful West German town right on the DDR border. Viewing a guard tower through binoculars, I recalled the scene in which Peter left the music festival in Berlin and ran to freedom.  A very thought-provoking movie.",1440633600,,545,4.281553398058253
8118278,5,B000F6ZEFK,"THANK YOU SO MUCH . I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS FOR YEARS . I SAW IT ONCE ONLY WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13/14 YEARS OLD AND CAN REMEMBER THE STORY SO CLEARLY .  I HAD AT THAT TIME A PEN FRIEND IN EAST GERMANY AND THE QUESTION I ASKED HIM IN ALL INNOCENCE COULD HAVE GOT HIM INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE IF HE HAD ANSWERED IT . I DO HOPE IT DIDN'T .
I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET BUT AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT .",1428796800,,399,3.4831460674157304
8118279,5,B000F6ZEFK,So glad I could locate a copy of this and see it again after so many decades. I first saw it as a teenager and have thought about it over and over again throughout my adult life.,1416355200,,178,3.8378378378378377
8118280,5,B000F6ZEFK,"This is the story of the son of a Lutheran pastor in the ""German Democratic Republic"" (more accurately, the Soviet Zone of occupation in central Germany) who, to further his musical education at the university level, must first fill out a questionnaire and, in particular, answer the seventh question - who has been of the most influence in his life?  The movie was made in the Federal Republic of Germany, with British and German actors, prior to the construction of The Wall.
 I first saw it as a teenager and thought then that the answer was less than, well, what it could have been. More than forty years later I have more appreciation for it.
 Our oldest daughter obtained her master's degrees at the University of Leipzig
(formerly Karl-Marx-Universitaet) in theology and political science a few years ago.
All but one of the half dozen theology professors had nominally been Spitzler (informants) - that's what it took to hold the position, although I doubt they betrayed anyone. It was enough compromise to satisfy the Communists and, perhaps, damage the souls of those who compromised. Such was life in that dreary prison.

8118281,2,B000F6ZEFK,"Question 7 was made in WEST Germany, back at a time when West (non-Communist) and East (Communist) Germany were quite hostile to each other.  And West Germany's film,  Question 7, presents a very negative depiction of life in East Germany in the 1960s, especially East Germany's discrimination against church membership and belief in a Christian God.  -- S.P. Hill.",1148428800,,365,5.1525423728813555
8118282,4,B000F6ZEFK,"This movie was filmed in 1960 about a pastor who is sent to the town of Osterstadt in East Germany under communist rule. It is a very gripping story of how the pastor's son, Peter, must make a decision to stand for his  faith or give in to the teachings and influences of the state to be what he  really wants to be - a pianist. At one point in the movie all of the  students in Peter's school are given a questionaire to complete in order to  be chosen for colleges and one of the questions is number 7: ""Who has  most influenced you social development?"" How does the boy answer? Does  he say the State, Karl Marx, or Christ? This is a must see movie for every  Christian in our ever changing post-Christian American culture of today.",919987200,10,735,4.244604316546763
