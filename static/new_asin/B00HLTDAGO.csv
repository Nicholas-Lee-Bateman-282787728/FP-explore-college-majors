6168604,5,B00HLTDAGO,"Love this movie. Haven't gotten the dvd yet because it hasn't been released yet so I pre-ordered it. But very good thriller ""Who done it""",1425513600,11,137,4.52
6168605,1,B00HLTDAGO,"Successful thrillers are a lot like successful horror movies -- you need to have at least one sympathetic character, or nothing in it will matter.

And that is where ""The Loft"" completely fails as a thriller, with a main cast of violently unlikable jerks who make cheating on their wives a way of life. Despite some fairly solid performances by Karl Urban and James Marsden (who are really trying to sell the silliness of it all), this remake of a Belgian thriller is too sterile to be sexy, too obnoxious to be likable, and too confusingly convoluted to really be thrilling.

Architect Vincent Stephens (Urban) is married, a father, and perpetually unfaithful to his wife. When he designs a sleek building in downtown, he arranges for joint ownership of a luxurious loft with five other men -- awkward Luke (Wentworth Miller), randy drunken Marty (Eric Stonestreet), lovestruck shrink Chris (James Marsden) and his violent half-brother (Matthias Schoenaerts). Each man is given a single key, so they can take their mistresses, prostitutes and one-night-stands there. Each man is sworn to secrecy.

Then one morning, Luke discovers a dead woman in the bed, and summons all his friends. With only five keys, the men start desperately trying to figure out who was there with the woman the night before, and who could possibly have murdered her. The men go back over their complicated affairs -- and discover the ugly secrets that will crack apart their friendship. And underlying all the lies and schemes is a sinister murder plot.

In an odd way, ""The Loft"" feels a bit like a stage play adapted to film -- most of it takes place in the titular loft, with the occasional interrogation at police headquarters or flashback to a party. So it's a very character-driven piece, with the men slowly falling to pieces as their friendships fracture apart -- we see what they are made of through flashbacks, affairs and the way they respond to the woman's death.

The problem is... it's difficult to care about the characters, because they are all horrible people. All of them, from the serial cheater Vincent to the creepy voyeur Luke to the violent rapist Philip. Every single one of these men ends up being a despicable person based on the very premise of the movie, especially since none of them have any reasonable excuses for having an affair, aside from a few of the wives being mildly irritable. The affairs are entirely based on the fact that all these characters are male, and thus think of themselves as being entitled to illicit sex due to their maleness. This is hammered home in one charming scene where Vincent presents Philip with a key for cheating filthy adultery... at his wedding reception.

The closest to a sympathetic character is Chris, whom I think we're supposed to sympathize with because he's supposedly in love with the hot blonde prostitute he barely knows... but he still acts pretty despicably, and his ""heroic"" role at the climax fails because of it. The wives, mistresses and police are little more than paper dolls for the men to react to, leaving nothing but the five main men to be fully developed characters. It also doesn't help that two very similar-looking blondes are cast in important roles, which left me confused until the movie's final scene about whether they were one person or not.

And with them being horrible people, who do we have to root for? No one.

So it's very difficult to care about the frame-up, the murder and the big ""conspiracy"" twist, because the tension falls flat if you don't care who lives or who dies, who's the murderer and whether he'll get away with it.

And you would expect the original movie's director, Erik Van Looy, to be able to remake his own movie best. But he presents us with a movie too sterile to be a proper erotic thriller -- most of the sex is just in soft-focus montages, with the occasional awkward sex scene where the man never removes his pants in bed. And the urgency of the narrative dies every single time we lurch back into a too-long flashback, leaving the movie choppy and awkward and full of obvious red herrings (Philip being the most obvious one).

And the story itself is an awkward mass of attempted Hitchcockian twists that just feel ridiculous. One of them never even makes sense, because it requires most of the cast to flawlessly fake almost all of their reactions and responses to EVERYTHING... in other words, a waste of the audience's time. The other ends up producing a mass of cliches and artsy photography at the climax... and by then, you'll be hard-pressed to care what happens.

One of the few good things is some of the actors. Urban gives the best performance, almost making you feel sorry for the utterly despicable Vincent. Marsden does a decent job, and Schoenaerts -- who played Filip Willems in the original movie -- also do decent jobs with their underdeveloped characters. Unfortunately, Miller just comes across as a wooden, weird, awkward mass of weird awkwardness, with no room for anything else; and Stonestreet is just violently annoying in every scene he's in.

Tedious and bereft of thrills, ""The Loft"" ends up being a chore because of its total lack of ANYONE likable in the cast -- a sleazy, cheesy expanse of wretched individuals and terrible twists. Only interesting if you're a dude who thinks sex with whomever you want is your birthright.",1424908800,15,5367,4.790270270270271
6168606,4,B00HLTDAGO,"The movie starts off with a murdered blond whose face we don't get to see for quite a while. The film is told with select flashbacks to the guys discovering the corpse and the formation of the Loft and before and not always in chronological order so not to reveal the whole story until the end.

Five professionals decide to share a loft in order to bring women there where their always suspecting wives won't be able to follow any money trail. The blond appears to be a woman introduced as a politician's aide whose boss is possessive. We also have 5 wives as suspects too. As the film goes on the plot reveals more of itself. It is made to seem complex due to the nature on how we are given clues.

The film leaves clues, but there is no way to tie them into anything. And PLOT SPOILER we don't always see what actually happened and have no way of knowing that until the end. It is a mystery that tries to be clever, but not good.

Not only can this tall, handsome Belgian speak several languages fluently, he can speak English in a variety of convincing accents. In Far From the Madding Crowd, he played a Wessex sheep farmer.

6168679,5,B00HLTDAGO,"this is a good movie, but be open mined when you watch it,
not because its hard to follow , because its not,
this could actually happen in real life
this is a good murder mystery movie!
these 5 good friends get together to  split the price of a nice loft,
sounds simple right?
the idea is a good one, but when you have 5 different personality's
and different lifestyles, any thing can happen and it all does
 each guy was given a key to the loft  and told not to tell anyone else about this& no one was to know where it was either  the loft is suppose to be so when one of the guy needs privacy from there life or whatever they could go there,
no one would have to worry about hidden hotel bills,  or know about any kind of  sexual in to windows.
one day , one of the guys buys some grocery's for his little rump, he is planing in the loft, he goes there opens up the
door, and there is a women laying in the bed had cuffed to the bed railing and all bloody.
he contacts the other four guys to find out who this women is and who did this
no one knows anything as far as it goes, you need to watch this movie and see what happens
and how they find out who and what , how this happens, this movie is a nail bitter!
there is some blood involved and no nudity at all, but lots of reasons why there should be!
the movie is worth watching and will keep you in your seat",1471392000,4,1363,3.9025270758122743
6168680,4,B00HLTDAGO,"THE LOFT ~ hmmmmmm, where to start.  This film is a remake from a German film of the same name - from what I understand.  I have not seen the German film, so I can't compare it to that - and I can't say if one is better than the other, but what I can say is that I liked this film.  It seems that it didn't get the best reviews, or at best - it got mixed reviews.  I will say this though - this movie makes men, the male species, look very, very bad, especially men like them, with wealth and power.  And as a man, I can say, we don't need the help.  I will also say, the film seemed to be somewhat incohesive.  As it goes along, and the plot unfolds, there's a point or two where it's not really clear what happened, or what's going on - and one does have to ""think"" about it - and ""figure"" it out.  But other than that, I liked it.  It was very entertaining - even though it makes my brothers in the Lord look like brothers on our way to hell.",1470787200,2,945,3.829896907216495

6168869,4,B00HLTDAGO,"I bought this movie based upon what I recalled from the previews, and . . . . I liked it!  As several other customer reviews stated, I threw it on as background, and found myself drawn into it.  THEN I went into the reviews (not the Amazon customer reviews) and was surprised to see how negatively The Loft was received by the critics.  I definitely believe this is a case of establishment critics 'overthinking it.'

I've always loved the noir erotic thriller as a form (though there are certainly plenty of terrible examples out there), and this one never seems to promise too much--and certainly delivers on what it does promise.  The movie's overall 'feel' is exactly what I look for from this genre--plenty of twists and turns, brisk pace, crisp editing, and eye candy.  By 'eye candy,' I am referring to not only the cast, but the locations, the lighting, the colors, and the attention to detail for the sets.  A guy like me will never be making in the high six figures . . . so I always enjoy when a director manages to evoke the lifestyles of guys I can relate to, but (unlike me) can afford the best of everything.  The loft apartment itself looks exactly the way I'd have my own pied--terre if there was no budget.  That these guys manage to blow it all through overindulgence is the morality twist that a part of me needs to see.  Vincent is the lady killer (no pun intended) we all knew in our 20s and both looks and acts the part.  Luke's jealousy is something all of us who knew a Vincent felt at one time or another for his conquests.  And the blondes (Ann and Sarah) are perfect.  No real nudity,  but the scene where Sarah is filmed from behind getting ready for the pool is a perfect example why erotic noir doesn't need to be explicit to evoke a lifestyle and a dynamic we all dream of, but few of us will experience.  In this scene, she is slowly revealed like a new showroom floor Ferrari having its car cover slowly and lovingly removed.  A work of art!

Why would we need anything more from this genre?  The critics whiffed on this one.",1450310400,,2059,4.387862796833773

6169018,1,B00HLTDAGO,"Irretrievably stupid, cardboard characters -- and that's just the men; the women are either insane bitchy harpies (the wives) or prostitutes, and the movie is not nearly fun enough for any of that to be excusable. By the end I was hoping it was the prequel to ""Armageddon"" so an asteroid would hit the whole thing.",1443916800,,314,4.625
6169069,2,B00HLTDAGO,"If nothing else, this movie is at least entertaining. That being said, there really is nothing else.

Substance? Bah....hahaha. Sure, there are a few naked ladies; but a few gorgeous rears are hardly enough to satisfy my expectations regarding a ""secret loft"" for five men to act out their carnal desires. If 50 Shades of Gray is Penthouse, The Loft is a jc penny's intimates catalogue.

Surprisingly, the lack of nudity doesn't make this movie any less superficial. Short on sex, this movie heaps on the sexism to ensure it's target audience doesn't leave entirely disappointed. Yet, as offensive as this may be to women, one should hope it would be equally offensive to men. Unless, of course, male viewers like their gender to be depicted as unfaithful, corrupt, and so sexually impulsive and shameless that they do little more than raise their voice when their coked out bro decides to mutilate a woman's dead body.

The sexist depictions of both men and women in the ""film"" are so overt and exaggerated that I have to wonder if this is not secretly a satire. What with its implausible plot and ""you've got to be freaking kidding me"" twist (not to be confused with its equally pathetic second twist), surely, this must be a comedy!

Is James Marsden an incredible actor? No, but he's starred in enough ok movies that I can't imagine he'd sign up to star in this if it was presented as anything but a joke. But if it's not a comedy, then Marsden must be in some deep sh*it. I don't know if they're holding his family hostage or blackmailing him, but it must be something bad if he's willing to lend his name to one of the most unsuspenseful ""thrillers"" and empty ""romances"" I've ever seen.

I made it to the end though, something I can't say for every piece of garbage I've started to watch, so it gets one extra star for not boring me to death.",1443830400,,1848,4.554216867469879

Karl Urban is a great leading man, and James Marsden is a likable guy who just wants to keep a kept woman from keeping on the way she has been ;)  Eric Stonestreet's portrayal of an alcoholic big mouth is only a bit of a stretch from his role as Cameron Tucker on ""Modern Family.""  The twists and turns will keep you watching, and the ending is...well, one that I really liked.

6169165,5,B00HLTDAGO,"The basic premise is The Loft is this:  Five dudes all share ownership of a loft apartment so they have a discreet place to go to bang chicks who are not their wives.  The movie opens with one of them showing up to find a dead and bloody chick handcuffed to the headboard and no sign of forced entry.

To set the stage a bit, when watching this movie, I was all by my onesie in my bedroom.  There are some plot twists in this movie that had me yelling NO BLEEPING WAY!!! at my television.  Yes, me, a grown adult, yelling at my TV.  Im a writer.  I look for oncoming plot twists whether I am reading a book or watching a movie.  I can usually spot it coming a mile off, and when a twist floors me the way two in particular did, I am beyond impressed.

The only thing that I could see being an issue with some viewers of this movie is there is a lot of time jumping  present, then past, then further in the past, then present, and so on and so on.  It wasn't an issue for me, but I could see it confusing some people.  Trust me, just stick with it.  Its so worth it.

Now my favorite part.  Karl Urban gets naked.  Thats right.  You read that right.  He gets starkers.  You only see his booty, but the little strip show is worth it anyway.  *faints and falls face-first on the floor*  Two thumbs up and bonus points for the mostly nude shot of my future ex-husband!!!",1440892800,11,1366,4.06015037593985

6169252,2,B00HLTDAGO,"I'm going to keep this short.  The film isn't for everyone.  In fact it isn't for anyone.  I was hoping to get a sexy who-done-it.  Well the film isn't sexy and as far as who did it, who cares?

Five best friends decide to rent a penthouse apartment, designed by one of the 5, architect Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban).  It is to be a getaway for extra-marital affairs.  The others include James Marsden as Chris, Matthias Schoenaerts as Chris's half-brother Phillip, Eric Stonestreet as Marty and Wentworth Miller as Luke.  No one is remotely likeable but the bigger issue is that it would seem none of them have anything in common.  I mean Phillip is a cokehead, Marty is a drunk and both think they are God's gift to women.

When a woman is discovered dead in the apartment, the 5 gather and try to figure out which of them killed her.  The movie meanders between the current setting and a much longer series of flashbacks.  I guess it's all supposed to be cool.  Well, the apartment is pretty cool.  The wives get plenty of screen time and it's pretty clear, the boys aren't fooling anyone.  Let's just say this...the movie is dumb.",1439510400,,1133,4.512315270935961

6169351,4,B00HLTDAGO,"The Loft is similar in set up to the straight to DVD movie Very Bad Things with Christian Slater.  In the Loft version a group of guys share the purchase of an apartment, each has a key (and due to a pact no one else does) where they can bring a woman any time to cheat on their wives knowing there will be no hotel bill or anything else to catch them out.  I did wonder who changes the sheets, since there doesn't seem to be a washing machine there, unless you're just throwing them away each time, seems an opportunity to get caught there.  But anyway one day one of them arrives and finds a dead blonde girl slashed up and handcuffed to the bedhead, he immediately summons the others and each wants to know why one of them did this?  You've got your usual, well we'd better call the cops, with the no way we can't call the cops back and forth banter and each reveal something the others in the group didn't know about one of the others causing a larger rift and more suspicion.  There's also a lot of flashback scenes to the wedding of one of them, a trip to San Diego and encounters with the girl in the bed while alive.

The Loft isn't that badly done, it's not really a mystery as you aren't given all the information, it is slowly leaked out to the viewer up until the final credits. They could even have ended the movie a number of times before a new twist was added and you would never have known. Once some of the information is known it does question some of the earlier reactions and fights that happened in the early scenes when they all get together after being summoned, but it's best not to dwell on these things when trying to enjoy the story.  Since we knew who the girl was, I also wonder why we have two female characters who look similar (played by Isabel Lucas and Rachel Taylor), this would have had some purpose if we were wondering who was on the bed, but since we already do it was confusing as sometimes you assumed it was the girl on the bed character and then thought oh hang on no she's the girl associated with one of the other guys.

Fans of Modern Family will enjoy seeing Eric Stonestreet in a different and less likeable character role to Cam.  Likewise Wentworth Miller as a lot less intelligent and able to be pushed around by more dominant characters guy than the one who broke out of jail and outsmarted in Prison Break.  There some weak aspects such as the fact there can't be any other key holders because you need a code to copy the key, when they are just a regular door key you could take down to the guy in your hardware store to copy for a few bucks.  Seinfeld even made fun of the can't duplicate key myth assumption in an episode where George believed this and never got a spare key cut.

The Loft probably isn't a film you'd ever watch a second time, but it's a decent once off viewing experience.  It's of course also a remake of a Belgian film, there's also a Dutch remake as well out there.",1438732800,,2942,4.241502683363149

6169354,4,B00HLTDAGO,"This remake of the Belgian erotic thriller of the same title provides a story revolves around five married men who conspire to secretly share a penthouse loft in a city wherein they could bring mistresses and fulfill their sexual fantasies without their wives knowing. It becomes a nightmare when a dead body was found in it. The five friends start to get rattled they begin to question friendships and loyalties knowing one of them is the guilty of committing the crime. Events that transpired during the last year were brought back into flashback scenes as the viewer gets know what led to this murder and gets into the puzzle of figuring out who among the five friends was responsible for the crime.

This has a lot of tension-filled moments with regards to the puzzle of the murder committed considering the complications involved and the ultimate solution to the guilty one. Despite of it,the film is not free of flaws as the performances of the main cast is far from compelling and somewhat lacking as a character-driven film as the viewer would least likely care about them.

6169527,4,B00HLTDAGO,"Wow, the description didn't really pull me in...to be honest I don't remember exactly why I decided to watch this movie but I was not disappointed. I thought I knew what was going on most of the time but I was proven wrong more than once. I don't give away spoilers and I won't start here so let me close by saying that you will most likely be very surprised by the ending. I can often guess the direction a story is going and more often than not I am right but this time I was a child making wild guesses. The actors were cast rather well and they played their parts well. I was never a big fan of James Marsden but he was excellent in this picture. I had trouble deciding whether or not I was rooting for his character, let alone whether I liked him or not. Mr Marsden was quite excellent. I don't mean to imply the other actors and characters were lackluster by any means, they were quite excellent as well but I was pulled in by Chris Vanowen, the actor played by Mr. Marsden.
 Some of the critics didn't like the movie and called the plot uninspired but I disagree. I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat more than once. I rather enjoyed the movie but I do have to add that watching it a second time might be difficult once you know the ending and most of the plot.  I can't give it 5 stars but I do with there was a 1/2 star because this movie earned 4 1/2 stars in my opinion. If you are a fan of mystery whodunnits then I suggest you give The Loft a chance. I think you will enjoy it.",1436054400,,1499,4.043771043771044

6169558,3,B00HLTDAGO,"Three stars is gracious.  The acting was superb, but the movie is just a LIfetime drama on steroids.  For me, personally, the mystery dragged on and on.  And then the truth had to be unraveled like a sexually abused onion--piece by by gooey piece.  The ending is so convoluted that some will call this a masterpiece and others will be rewinding to see the hints in the film.  Me?  All I know is, I'm not buying a loft with a bunch of dudes.

There is a moral here: Break up with your wives FIRST.  Then go horn around.  Loft unnecessary and, frankly, way too expensive.

Second Moral: Women, if you meet a man with a loft he shares, RUN.

Third Moral: You notice how there was no black guy doing this crazy, gross stuff?  No Hispanic?  No Chinese guy?  The only good white guys are Italian and Irish, ladies.  :)

Oh, and the wives in this movie are just as bad as the guys, so enjoy this misanthropic romp through human sexuality.  I'd rather rock myself to sleep in a Walmart storage closet.

One morning, a bloodied dead woman is found in the bedroom and the arguing and finger-pointing begins. This seemingly has all the ingredients for a great small-scale tension cranker, but ambition gets the best of it, it tries to go large, and the whole thing blows to bits on the launchpad. It's terribly acted, for one, which is something of a surprise given the healthy careers enjoyed by its stars. Karl Urban and James Marsden are well-seasoned, even if they aren't exactly leading men, and Eric Stonestreet - while miscast in a very adult role - should at least know how to carry himself on the screen. Instead it's amateur hour, where limp first-takes abound, and the finished product is something I would expect from a bit of Cinemax softcore, not a polished big-budget production. I don't care about, or even remotely like, a single one of the characters, the writing goes around in circles seeking every possible twist, and the ending really doesn't even make any sense. Points for the concept, and for a few scanty bits of eye candy, but otherwise this is a major whiff.",1435276800,,1202,4.783653846153846

6169704,5,B00HLTDAGO,"I rented The Loft honestly because I am a fan of Eric Stonestreet and the trailer looked interesting enough but I was seriously impressed. The plot was extremely dynamic  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The way it was filmed  going back between current events and the past  made the characters and their actions a lot more compelling. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, they totally turned the tables on me. This is not just a movie about five guys buying a loft to hide their affairs from their wives. It is on par with some of my favorite drama/thrillers from the 90s/early 2000s like The Perfect Murder, What Lies Beneath, Fatal Attraction, and The Game.",1433635200,,691,4.512

Makes no sense, and if you've seen more than one episode of any 'Cop Drama' out there on TV, you can poke enough holes in the script to make it able to strain your vegetables.. Just weird, none of the characters are at all likeable (unless you like sketchy, misogynist, cheating, violent sociopaths), and by the end, my husband and I didn't even really care 'whodunnit', we just wanted to see if our guess was correct, which it more or less was, give or take a few of the more absurd plot twists... Don't waste your time. We thought it would be a fun, brainless diversion, but it was just brainless, in all the irredeemable ways. Avoid.

6169772,4,B00HLTDAGO,I would give 4 1/2 stars really if possible because of the slightly lame very ending. But overall this was very good acting and storytelling and a nice break from the usual CGI driven dreck we have been abused with over the last decade. Just proves that you can still make good movies without a 200 million budget. I might be off on this but I think it's possible we may see more good film making due to the success of great TV shows like Breaking Bad. I'll take great movie making over stupid super hero movies any day of the week. I would love to see these lousy CGI movies start losing money so Hollywood would stop making them.,1432598400,2,631,4.266666666666667
6169773,3,B00HLTDAGO,"Overall Enjoyable.

Likes:
Naturally fond of thrillers and mysteries this definitely feed the need for that.
It's not an action movie playing as a thriller or vice versa.
Mostly a handsome/beautiful cast, plenty of eye candy.
Wasn't over the top.

Dislikes:
Though a pretty handsome cast throughout, I found it disturbing that the husbands cheated on typical brunette housewives for blond chicks & literally one of the chicks is a slut. Not cool. Would've been far more interesting to see the men cheat with the ""not-so"" typical. A transexual? A big girl? A man? Maybe one isn't cheating at all (or vicariously living out a fantasy), but simply looking for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of kids and a wife. Maybe one of them actually gets caught in the loft itself, or spin! A wife is having an affair in the loft??
It wasn't action packed, and though for me that's a good thing, a few swinging guns would have done this movie some justice.

Overall very fair.
Would I buy this movie? No, but I would definitely encourage someone else to see it at least once.",1432598400,,1066,4.62962962962963
6169794,2,B00HLTDAGO,"It started okay with a murder of blond girl and five men trying to get to the bottom of it before it ruins them professionally and socially. It has plenty of twists and turns. It is a who done it movie except you are not given all the clues, and you cannot figure it out. Unfortunately for me, the story never grabbed me. As it went on I got bored. Towards the end, I really did not care less who did it.

The acting itself is pretty good.  Eric Stonestreet, played particularly well.  Isabel Lucas had her moments. Those two were the only characters that was interesting to me.

The filming was good.

Would I see it again, NO? I almost did not see it a first time.",1432512000,,666,4.171875

Things are going fine until they find a dead woman in the bed. Friendships are tested as they try and figure out who she is, and who killed her. I didn't know what to expect from this movie at all. I didn't see any previews for this and I was really just hoping it would be something I wouldn't have to fight to stay awake through. What I found was that I was sucked in almost right away and could not look away. The movie is very well written and while the twists are a little predictable it doesn't distract from the enjoyment or the tenseness of the movie in any way. This is like a grown up Very Bad Things and I'm not sure if it was because I had no expectations for this movie but I really really enjoyed it and I recommend this as a change of pace movie.

6169801,3,B00HLTDAGO,"The Loft is apparently a remake of a Dutch film, with both being directed by Erik Van Looy. I've heard of this happening a few times before now, but I always find it interesting that the same director would be involved in both films. I'd be interested to see the original Loft movie to see how it compares to this remake and what changes Van Looy made (if any).  But, since I haven't seen the original, I can't speak to that. So.. The Loft is about 5 married men that share a secret penthouse apartment that they use to see women and carry out affairs without their wives knowing. This movie is a thriller/whodunnit-style of movie, with the whodunnit starting when one of the men discover a dead women in the apartment. Since only the 5 men (James Marsden, Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, and Matthias Shoenaerts) have keys and know about this apartment, they try to determine which of them killed this woman and what to do, since none of them want their wives finding out about the apartment.

There were a lot of twists and turns to this movie, and the plot was unveiled in an interesting way as it jumped back and forth between them discovering the body, them being interviewed by police, and back to earlier times when they were renting the apartment and carrying on these affairs.  Despite the plot twists, I didn't think this movie was much of a thinker, which was fine by me because then I could just check out and enjoy the movie without having to put forth much effort into trying to follow a difficult storyline.

Overall, I thought the movie was enjoyable. It had an interesting premise and I liked it, however, it would have been more enjoyable and more ""thrilling"" had certain parts made more sense. There were a few ideas that weren't fully explored or explained, resulting in some plot holes that I thought could have been cleaned up a bit.

The most glaring issue to me that drove me crazy was that the men's main means of renting or buying this apartment wasn't fully explained. The thought behind having this secret apartment was so the men wouldn't have hotel and restaurant receipts to clue their wives in on their affairs, but the movie never addressed how they paid for this apartment without their wives knowing about it or becoming suspicious, nor does the movie address why the wives aren't suspicious when their husbands don't come home at night (unless it's during the day..or they say they're away on business..or maybe the wives are out of town..?) There were also a few details regarding a realtor and Wentworth Miller's character that I didn't feel were fully resolved or explained enough to my liking.

Overall, a decent movie, but it definitely could have been improved upon, in my opinion.",1426204800,10,2739,4.672199170124482
6169802,1,B00HLTDAGO,"Based off a Begium film directed by Erik Van Looy of the same name is The Loft. Five friends arrive at their secret pad to discover a dead woman lying on a bed. As each of them try to uncover the mystery of who the killer is they soon turn on one another. But when the answers trickle in little by little they realize that friendship isn't always so pleasant. The film stars Karl Urban, James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, and Matthias Schoenaerts in a crime thriller that leaves you in disbelief to the very end.

Watching the trailer for this film I didn't see any good coming out of this movie because of how similar weve seen these types of scenarios play out. A group of friends start a secret that ends up turning into trouble as one of them is possibly the culprit. And while your watching The Loft you cannot help but be bothered by how wrong all of these characters are. Were introduced to a group of friends who are all married and decide to share a loft to get away so to speak from their day-to-day lives and have drugs, sex, and alcohol. First and foremost, all of the guys come off as dis-likable whos behaviors come into question many times throughout the film. I couldn't keep count as to how many of them either cheat or lie to their own respective wives.

The script for the film has a decent plot although familiar in other movies in recent past. Its just the lame motives behind some of the characters that you find it hard to believe that they get away with so much. And then theres a character who the movie tries to make look like a hero that it doesnt work or make sense. It doesnt matter by me mentioning the characters by name just because they all were horrible in their own right. The only ones Ill mention are Vincent, played by Karl Urban, and Chris (James Marsden) who stand out so to speak. I never liked Vincent because he was the one that never seemed trustworthy to begin with. And then theres Chris who has a wife and family and goes on to cheat on his wife with a prostitute by the name of Anne (Rachel Taylor) whos the only one you find sympathy for. How sad is it to say that the prostitute was the only person you felt bad for while the main characters are sleazy.

This brings me to the twists in the film because when we get to the heart of the matter everyone is guilty in some shape or form. And when the additional twist is added to the craziness your left thinking how did these idiots get so far in life without getting caught or supporting each others motives for whatever reason. The final twist at the end just left me laughing inside because of how illogical and insane it is. Im sorry but I don't know how the director or writers think people are going to remember this train wreck when theres nobody to cheer for. And since Im at it Ill also mention the wives in the movie. They play a small part in one of the reveals that makes you even question just how pitiful they are as their husbands. So in final, everyone but the prostitute I had no sympathy for.

So lets talk about prostitute Anne who we come to find out is being paid for her services and feels threatened that she cant escape from her life. When she has a fling with Chris she tells him that he cant love her because of the kind of person she is. By the end of the movie we find out she moved on and ended her life as a prostitute and wants to have a better living. And in the final scene we find Chris and Anne bumping into each other at a parking garage where possibly they may find friendship. Now remember the movie tries to make Chris look like the best of the worst but in reality hes a piece of work that is anything but trustworthy.

If this review hasn't frustrated you by now then you can only imagine how stressful it was watching it. You will tear your eyes out at how appalling these friends actions are and in trying to justify any means of sanity. Please don't watch this movie because even though you may find the mystery surrounding the dead girl of some interest youll just be flabbergasted by the details and laugh it off. Im just sure glad January is coming to an end as we usher in a new month that hopefully has decent films to sit through.",1426204800,3,4194,4.257214554579674

It's no wonder this was a flop, one of those ""I-need-a-check"" concoctions (can't call it a film). Perhaps a theme was karma; when you do wrong, it'll bite you in the ass...and dick. It still wasn't clear if Wentworth Miller's character Luke was a voyeur with bisexual tendencies or just madly obsessed with the beautiful young blonde dame. It's probably just art imitating life, men are usually going to go for the next pretty young thing until it expires.
