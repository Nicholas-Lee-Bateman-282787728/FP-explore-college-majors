Directing was superb especially the cinematography in setting locations, lighting and camera angles. The editing for the oscillating two time periods presented in the story flowed as if conducted for an orchestra. Well done!

Acting was exemplary-naturale especially and surprisingly for the nouveau actress, seven year old young Goni. Kudos!",1314057600,,504,5.706666666666667
