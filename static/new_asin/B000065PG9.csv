1709049,5,B000065PG9,"Space Travelors like Kia - Zev - Stanley always seem to cross paths of other wanderors

and lost souls like me in the universe.  Managed to hitch-hike a ride with them on the Lexx

from series two through four.  Damned incredible journey that makes me regret that I wasn't

with them right from the beginning of 'The Dark Zone'.  Haven't seen any of series one - the

four films.  Damned !  Someone out there in the dark zone just has to put together a dvd box

set of that session before the end of the world takes us all away from our televisions -

annihilates LEXX to obscurity.  Let's resurrect Stanley Tweedle for President of the USA with

Zev as The First Lady !  Kia as The Secretary of Defense!  So freaking pleased that my eyes

and deviant imagination found this series on Amazon.com !",1175904000,4,797,4.393103448275862
1709050,5,B000065PG9,"This is a great series. I don't have a lot to add that others haven't already mentioned. I would like to clarify some confusion and difficulty as to how to get the entire first season, the four mini-movies.

They do not all appear to be available from Amazon.com, well, volume 1, 2 and 4 are available, but volume 3, Eating Patterns, is not.

Save yourself the irritation. Just go to Amazon.ca, the canadian version, sign in using your normal name and password and look up Lexx Series One.

You can obtain all four movies with one click, including the difficult to find volume 3, just order: Lexx: Season 1: Ep. 1.1-1.4

Hope this saves some people some time.",1142380800,38,659,4.559322033898305
1709051,3,B000065PG9,"The Lexx universe is a somewhat depressing, Orwellian creation of mindless bureaucracy and an underlying sense of evil. His Divine Shadow, the supreme ruler, exists to rule through order. That makes for a fairly dreary and miserable existence. It is a universe of bread and circuses. There are a few alternatives, however.

There is a parallel shadow world about which little is known except that it is chaotic. There is also an active resistance within the realm of His Divine Shadow. The story begins to come together with the confluence of several events.

A minor bureaucrat faces ""reprogramming"" or possibly extinction for his minor personal failings. His failure to face his problems leads him to get into deeper trouble.

A frumpy woman makes the disorderly mistake of slugging her fianc when he is disappointed with her appearance. She is sentenced to a new, very attractive body and life as a sex slave.

A leader of the resistance is caught and about to be sentence to death in an arena. He has a plan of escape that goes slightly off plan when one of his gizmos is unwittingly damaged by the bureaucrat mentioned above. He still manages to wreak some havoc and escape in the confusion. He takes with him these previous two characters.

The last member of a long dead race is revived to track down these fugitives. He is utilized by His Divine Shadow as an assassin. He is really dead but his body and mind are utilized (against his will) by means of advanced technology. He goes after the fleeing escapees but defects. He helps them to capture the Lexx, an immensely powerful ship. Together, they flee into the shadow zone.

The story doesn't hang together too well but it does manage to maintain interest. Partly, this is because of Zev, the very decorative sex slave character. Partly it is because of the hapless bureaucrat who manages to be amusing. Partly it is to see what silliness will occur next. It's certainly not great but I am willing to give it a chance and see what develops.",1137456000,6,2001,4.71919770773639
1709052,5,B000065PG9,"I am a huge fan of Lexx. I really think it is one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV. I got into it around the middle of the second season & became an addict after that. I have all of the DVD's & have seen every episode (even the movies) multiple times. I plan to review each DVD, each episode, one by one. So here's my review for Series 1, Volume 1

Episode 1.1: I Worship His Shadow -This is it, the beginning of the show Lexx.  The first ""season"" consisted of 4 mini-movies & this is the first one in the series.  A great first episode, where you learn about the history of the Kai, Stan & Xev. It's a long story but I'll try to summarize.  Kai's people, the Brunnen-G, get destroyed by the Divine Shadow.  Kai was killed and re-animated (with this stuff called Proto-Blood) & made into an assain for his shadow.  Stan was a part of a group of heretics fighting against the Divine Shadow, but Stan got caught & lost some codes that ended up killing lots of his people, the Divine Order kept him around in case they ever needed more information & made him a lowly security guard on the cluster.  Zev was deserted by her parents & put in a wife bank.  She got sent to the cluster & was sentenced to become a love slave, but something went wrong & she became part Cluster Lizard.  Basically this mini-movie shows all of this background, plus it shows how they 3 end up together & how they get the Lexx (The Lexx being the ship they fly in, it's a living Bug that need to eat & can blow up planets with ease.  It was meant to be a weapon for his Divine Shadow).  Of course stealing the Lexx makes The Divine Shadow mad & he chases after the crew.  It's a great episode & really shows the history behind the show.  It sets up the other min-movies & the series really well.  It's a great story & I think the best of the 4 mini-movies of the first season.  Check it out if you can, especially if you liked the series.

That does it for this review check out my other reviews for Lexx",1099267200,43,1983,4.098445595854923
1709053,5,B000065PG9,"The science fiction world has been wrapped up for so long with Star Wars & Star Trek (great....I admit) that it only spawns clones of each. I love to see shows like Lexx & Red Dwarf get the credit they deserve. Funny and exciting, but yet maintain their completely science fiction qualities.

Looking for something different go with Lexx.",1046908800,22,338,4.728813559322034
1709054,5,B000065PG9,"The Lexx series varies wildly in terms of quality and story.  Not so with the first four episodes or mini-series.
This is truely one of the most odd and strange rendering of an alien society that's ever hit film.  For that alone it gets high marks, but more than that, the world of Lexx is brutal, funny, sometimes sexy and nihilistic.
Most of the Lexx series is an acquired taste but this first installment is well-rendered and better than the majority of sci-fi fare out there.",1020211200,39,479,4.558139534883721
1709055,5,B000065PG9,"This is the first of the series.  It set the basic premise for  all that would follow in this series.  The show moves quickly introducing the a villain, a hero, an anti Hero as well as the yor standards sex slave, planet killer and Robot head characters.  The  plot twist and story line are somewhat familiar with some good suprises along the way.  Buy it, invite some friends over start the show up and have some fun where it all began for LEXX.",1018742400,13,446,4.313253012048193

7961471,5,B000065PG9,"This is the beginning of the series.  Great if you buy the series separately, but if yo buy the packet of LEXX Season 1&2 you don't need this as it is in the packet.  I loved it, gives you the origins of this series and gets you Hooke for more.",1405728000,,244,3.86
7961472,5,B000065PG9,"Bad review here, but ""I worship Eva Habermann."" She should have been an international star. She was excellent in this series. I didn't think I'd like it, but it is so quirky andhumerous that it took me right in. Now I'm a Lexx and Eva fan.",1393977600,,239,4.217391304347826
7961473,5,B000065PG9,Totally ridiculous story but who'd ever have thought of insect style space vessels. Good eye candy now and then and fun fantasy getaway.,1391817600,,136,4.956521739130435
7961474,5,B000065PG9,"From accidentally seeing switching channels with the SyFy channel was running a re-run of the very begging what happened how all 4 got together in why each character is the reason why they are all in this wheel to be able to do what they can to keep it going. Sad to see Eva Haberman, leave the show playing the part of Zev, but glad for her to move on to better things like we all do.  The newer Xez character ( Xenia Seeberg), the writers did a good job on how and why the newer Xez is the reason why.

I would recommend this DVD to better under stand the series :)",1380153600,,567,4.008849557522124
7961475,5,B000065PG9,Wild. Very wild. Enjoyable to the nth degree; my wife would not agree. She prefers the resistance fighters escaping the Nazis through the sewers of some European city.,1359676800,,167,5.0
7961476,3,B000065PG9,"First aired as a TV series LEXX,is a good thing to own as part of your personal collection. With a wonderfully wierd crew aboard a living spaceship the adventures never end,and this is one of them. Awesome!",1249862400,2,206,4.594594594594595
7961477,5,B000065PG9,"First off let me say this, an American Company needs to gain the rights to Season One.  Season one consisted of four 2 hour movies which aired here in the States late night on Showtime.
Way back in 1997 one of my friends taped the four movies, at the time I didn't have cable or satellite, and brought them over.  The fact that 65% of the show was computer generated was amazing at the time.  It was the atitude of the show that got me most.  The tongue in cheek humor, the raw kinky sexuality.  The show never apologized foir anything.  That was great....  The characters....  The underdog loser who gains the key to the most powerful weapon in two universes....the Beautiful Love Slave who cannot find a man to satisfy her....the unstoppable undead assasin who only has enough life left for ten days out of the refridgerator, the wise cracking traitorous robot head with total lust for one of the characters...and Lexx the childlike, after being brain damaged, ship they travelled on.....  I miss this show.
I had to order the original series one from Canada back in 2000 on DVD, it was region one, but recently heard that it was out of print there, and had never been released stateside in DVD format....  A shame.....
I've heard it compared to the more popular Farscape many times, because they both featured a crew of misfits on living ships I supose.... But Lexx beat farscape to screen by several years.... However alot of folks probaly remember Lexx as it was run on Sci-Fi...in the time slot after Farscape about two years later when Sci-Fi started broadcasting seasons 2-4.  Anyway if you want to see an original series in the Sci-Fi genre, and want some laughs, and like your humor a bit naughty then this is the show for you.  I know it's one of my favorites.",1185235200,6,1771,4.569620253164557
7961478,1,B000065PG9,"This is a cross between a horror story and a Science Fiction story. I like both of these types of stories but I don't like this.

I found the story weak both in technical science which it has none and its actual story.

Also it needs more characters, the characters it has are weak.

The acting is okay at best.",1184889600,2,311,4.15
