1094677,3,6305944350,"I would seriously appreciate it if ""Something Weird Video) would lose the opening crappy montage of creepy, seedy and sicko, twisted, scum-sucking bottom feeder trailer clips.  Their trademark you say?  Lose it anyway.  Touted as a Sci-Fi Comedy film, this 1968 release runs 69 minutes.  This is a ""Something Weird Video"" $17.5K exploitation effort to almost put a storyline with erotica.  No shaved lunchmeat sandwiches in these sixties vintage dinner boxes, although there is variety.  Not all of the actresses go wholly buff, and there isn't any bratwurst on the grill, strictly salmon.  There is however a well-stocked display of lactose canteens.  Keeping within the boundaries of softcore, some prefer their business partner with the same chromosomes.  Some lash out at others and whip them into a frenzy.  I would be willing to bet 98% of those who purchase and watch this film will never tell anyone, anywhere, for as long as they live.  Me neither.  I have no idea who Cara Peters, Karla Conway, Merci Montello, or Fancher Fague are.  I may never see worse special FX ever, or hear more annoying soundtrack noise again.  This UR film won't be otherwise given anything under a NC-17 in my lifetime.  The alien incognito says he's from Kansas City, Kansas.  You'll end up sticking this one in the back of your socks drawer, more than likely.  Is it hot in here, or is it just me?",1339286400,5,1386,4.829787234042553
1094678,1,6305944350,"Is this movie relevant to the 60's nudie films. I guess you could say yes. Sorry for this contradictory review,because I'm not sure which way to go with this .It's kinda boring but if you fast foward past some of the parts that drag and go straight to the weird kinky sex scenes(of course the DVD release is  from Something Weird Video) then you should get a pretty good laugh,as I for one did. One of those movies that has a great trailer but as a whole for the movie it's a bit of a bore. One star for the premise,0 stars for keeping my interest in watching the whole movie. The sets are so cheap,it's funny. The costumes of the actors are something to behold. Good pick up as a novelty piece to add to a collection,just as long as you don't pay much. Still even though there is a certain novelty charm to ""Space Thing"",I really don't think it deserves more then 1 star. A good 60% of this 1966 nudie cutie feature is still boring as hell. The trailer is probally the best thing about it. I have seen a complilation of bad movies from the past set DVD(I'm forgetting what it's called,something 42nd street something,oh well)and this garbage is on it garnering a 5 star trailer rating.",1229472000,2,1186,4.366515837104072
1094679,4,6305944350,"I'm not on here to add a lot in the way of perceptive analysis of ""Space Thing,"" as I don't think this is Shakespeare or Dante. I decided to jump in the discussion because I believe some reviews are unfairly harsh in not considering the type of movie this is. ""Space Thing"" is not cerebral science fiction that puts you in deep thought like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Forbidden Planet."" No, this is intended to be a sexy and schlocky film with some sci-fi window dressing, and no serious story intended. If what you want is a film with lots of eye candy, ""Space Thing"" has several great-looking ladies who come out of their gauzy space suits with the slightest hint, with an interstellar super-stud on board to give them a good excuse to. In that aspect alone I think it rates 4 stars. Picture quality is decent too and is full screen, though of the bonus features only the director commentary amounts to much. To sum up, not much here in the way of story, the sets and costumes are cheesy, acting pretty bad, and special effects are a laugh. But if you enjoy sci-fi films whose claim to fame is T & A with some hot female astronauts, ""Space Thing"" is a lot of fun. In this regard it's by far the best of the box set that includes ""Space Thing,"" ""Nude On the Moon,"" and ""Wham, Bam, Thank You Spaceman,"" which are all the same type of movie.",1167091200,4,1341,4.325396825396825
1094680,2,6305944350,"This is a poorly made adult space spoof from the late 1960s, and despite the fact that I normally like the Something Weird line, this one is probably best left on the shelf. The print of the film is much better than most films of this generation, and the color is excellent, but besides that and a few not unattractive girls, it does not have much to recommend it.

The acting here is very bad and the sets would have made Ed Wood blush. The movie begins with a guy fighting with his wife about the plausibility of some sci-fi magazines he was reading, then quickly he becomes a space refugee stranded in what appears to be a model of part of the USS Enterprise (from ""Star Trek"") but he refers to as a ""small space canoe."" We later learn that he was saved from a collision that killed all his crewmates by his ""supersonic sneakers.""

He pulls along this saucer that must be seen to be believed, and comes aboard. You will note that everyone is wearing some form of pajamas, including the cat-suited female Captain. Perhaps the biggest spectacle of the film is the hair on these women. (Well, that and the blue eye shadow.) We see a bit of life onboard the spaceship (do not miss the toast performed at mealtime!) and then realize that our protagonist is out to destroy this ship as they are sworn enemies.

Because of his sabotage, they are forced to land on an asteroid (which looks exactly like the desert of Southern California), which they all explore in gauzy gowns. They basically wander around the desert scheming against each other while bad pan flute music plays in the background, further annoying the audience. Before it is over we get to see a very bad ray gun effect, a game of space checkers (which is a clear rip off of the ""Star Trek"" three dimensional chess) and the power of a ""micro atomic bomb!"" The best scene in the film is when the protagonist looks longingly at a picture of his family. You will laugh so hard you may fall off the sofa.

The film comes with a commentary track from Producer David F. Friedman, who reveals, among other things, that the entire film was made for $17,000 and was shot on 35mm stock, which means the actors must have been very well compensated, indeed...

There are two shorts, ""Roll Oh Robot"" is a futuristic tale of a robot butler and the hilarity he causes (he has a unique vacuum foot attachment that would be kind of useful), and ""Dance of Tomorrow"" is a little musical nightmare you might have seen on MST3K, featuring ugly fashions, and even uglier cars.

Overall, this has some funny moments, most of which involve ""special"" effects, but there are better Something Weird titles out there.",1093651200,6,2650,4.521920668058455
1094681,1,6305944350,"""Screwball sci-fi"" is a misleading label for SPACE THING; it's a boring pseudo-sex film whose only saving grace is a quartet of attractive starlets.
Producer David Friedman says that SPACE THING was made because, as of 1967, no one had yet made a sci-fi nudie movie.  But apart from the ""outer space"" setting, there is no legitimate science- fiction in SPACE THING.  The derivative spaceship sets and costumes are really all that separate SPACE THING from, for example, BOAT THING or TRAIN THING.
The narrative structure of SPACE THING is compartmentalized to allow for all the staple elements of Friedman's ""adult"" entertainment, but without a plot there's no purpose to anything that happens, beyond serving as mere spectacle.
So SPACE THING unsurprisingly works best as a spectacle.  The sex scenes are tepid and truncated, but the women are very pretty.  The color print used by Something Weird is gorgeous.  But since this film is of the substance and character of cotton candy, SPACE THING badly needs a second feature to bring the disc up to snuff.  The HEAD MISTRESS/FANNY HILL DVD (a Friedman double-feature from Something Weird) is a much better value.
This ""special edition"" is for Friedman/SWV completists and the most rabid (i.e., uncritical) sci-fi collectors only.",1026950400,11,1279,5.125
1094682,3,6305944350,"If you like to see big-breasted babes cavorting in the nude, you will enjoy this movie.  If you like low-budget sci-fi with laughable special effects, you will enjoy this movie.  If you like a story that makes some sense, however, you will not find one here.  Even filmmaker Friedman, in his commentary, laments the lack of plot in this genre entry in the nudie-cutie field.  He admits that if it were not a softcore effort, with only naked girls to provide interest,  it would probably be considered a worse film than the classic Plan 9 from Outer Space.  Ed Wood probably had a bigger budget on Plan 9 than Friedman had here!
The special effects?  Colored cotton balls for asteroids, and plastic models bought in a hobby shop for the spaceships, hung on thread to simulate flight.  One of them is a model of the flying saucer from the TV series The Invaders and the other is a model of the good ship Enterprise from Star Trek, saucer section removed, and hung upside down!  Friedman says he wasn't even aware that it was upside down while making the movie!  Evidently he wasn't a Trekker.
But he was a fan of the pulp magazines in his youth, in particular Amazing Stories (as was Steven Spielberg!) and Planet Stories.  The latter especially because of its lurid covers which always featured a scantily-clad woman in danger from a horrible monster of some sort.  He says he wanted to capture some of the sexy fun of those colorful covers, and to a degree, he did, by uncovering some sexy girls with impressive special effects of their own.
The commentary is about the only interesting thing in the special features of this DVD.  There's an overlong and somewhat boring gallery of poster art, repetitive and not too well done, a couple of short subjects, scene index, trailer, and that's about it.  If you want sci-fi on a shoestring, and a G-string, this movie's for you!",983664000,23,1873,4.636363636363637
1094683,4,6305944350,"I love this DVD! Well, to be honest, I've only watched it with the filmmaker's commentary on, but trust me, you aren't missing much!
David Friedman sits down with video distributor Mike Varney (sp?) to discuss the making of this obscure ""nudie cutie,"" and Friedman is none-too-hesitant to call it the worst film ever made. He's not far off. As stated before, watching the movie without the commentary is needless, there's nothing to it really. Lots of T&A, some space ship models and some very bare sets (no pun intended). The stories that Friedman and Varney recount are the best part, from the history of the theaters this type of movie played in, to how Friedman got around the legalities of using the Starship Enterprise in this celluloid schlock.
If you're a fan of bad sci-fi or T&A flicks, this is a definite must!",971308800,17,821,4.708333333333333

7898249,2,6305944350,"This is not soft core and as a T&A movie it is very lacking. The acting is sub-par, there should be much more nudity, and in this movie the men don't have to take their clothes off when they have sex, This is really bad, and not worth paying for, even for free it may not be worth your time unless you are a fan of this kind of movie.

7898250,1,6305944350,"I know these types of movies typically don't aim very high but even by B-movie standards this is a dud.
