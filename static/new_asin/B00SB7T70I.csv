8697967,5,B00SB7T70I,"This 2 DVD set is another Beatles related set of films we all enjoyed. The first on the Apple Empire is one of the finest documentaries on the group I've ever seen.
The programs hold the interest right across the four plus hours the two DVDs run for.and are ripe for repeat viewings

8697968,5,B00SB7T70I,The other reviews that are complaining that this 2 x DVD set is 'a false front' are in my view wrong. Both films are about the final years of the Beatles and the 2 films included - especially the film on the Apple Empire - are both wonderful. To suggest that Apple was not among the reasons that ended the Beatles is badly informed. Watching this particular DVD emphsises this point. It was quite simply a pivotal factor. I heartily recommend this set.,1446249600,,452,4.457831325301205
8697969,1,B00SB7T70I,"This collection is false front to two separate DVDs that are unrelated to the stated subject material on the box. What you find inside the cardboard box are the following two DVDs:
""Strange Fruit: the Beatles' Apple Records"" http://smile.amazon.com/Beatles-Strange-Fruit-Apple-Records/dp/B00B680GGS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429918204&sr=8-1&keywords=strange+fruit%3A+the+beatles%27
""Composing the Beatles songbook: Lennon & McCartney 1966-1970""  http://smile.amazon.com/Composing-Beatles-Songbook-McCartney-1966-1970/dp/B001G9CNJK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1429918344&sr=8-2&keywords=Composing+the+Beatles+songbook

These may or may not be good DVDs that you will enjoy but neither specifically state that they are about how the group fell apart, rather they seem to focus on the history of their Apple Records production company & how their songs during 1966-1970 composed.  Neither DVD is sanctioned by the artists or Apple Records.  The box claims the following: ""...This 2 DVD film set does not attempt to address this lack of clarity [as to the confusing rumors of why they broke up].... instead it provides a new look at the second half of the Beatles' career.... Taking events in a uniquely objective manner and without the constraint of chronology, this film collection develops many new and previously unheard opinions and backs them up with the newest research, the rarest footage and the finest production values yet to grace a Beatles documentary.""  Nowhere on the box does it state the titles of the two documentaries.  It misleadingly gives a copyright date of 2015 for the box, but the two DVDs inside are dated 2008 & 2011.",1429833600,2,1635,6.212389380530974
8697970,1,B00SB7T70I,I thought this was a documentary on how it fell apart? I got 2 DVD's not relating to that at all.......,1429228800,,103,3.9523809523809526
