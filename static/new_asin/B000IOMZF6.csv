2659538,5,B000IOMZF6,"After taking an online course with Eva, I decided to order the DVD to ""attend"" one of her seminars and ""meet"" her on a different level. As you can tell by some of the other reviews, Eva attracts followers. Its an excellent seminar.  If you don't know what the bubble method is -- this DVD will pay for itself in the first 15 minutes!",1200441600,3,333,4.203125
2659539,4,B000IOMZF6,"If your answer is ""Yes!"" then this DVD will help.  Filmed at one of her seminars, Eva Shaw covers the Bubble Method for brainstorming and organizing ideas.  She demonstrates the method's use, explaining as she goes, and includes clips from the audience question and answer period at the end.  The same method can be used for articles, short stories, and pretty much any other form of the written word.  I've watched it a couple of times and recommend it for anyone overwhelmed by the task of assembling their thoughts and notes into a well-planned piece of work.  So, that being said, are you serious or not?",1192233600,6,608,4.69811320754717
2659540,5,B000IOMZF6,"Eva Shaw is an encouraging, enthusiastic, and wonderful teacher, and she shares some of her writing expertise in this interesting and informative DVD. I had brainstormed writing ideas before. I had sometimes used clustering and mindmapping to generate and organize ideas. I had read Eva's descriptions of the Bubble Method (her term for this technique of brainstorming and organizing)...

But actually seeing the bubble method in action was enlightening!

Watching Eva brainstorm and use the bubble method with a group of writing workshop participants, was like seeing the pieces of a puzzle fall into place. The bubble method came alive for me, and the thought of putting the bare bones of a book together quickly and easily became real.

The question and answer session at the end, as well as the writing tips Eva shares as she demonstrates the bubble method, were also great additions to the DVD's content.

I'm sure I'll be watching this DVD many times -- not only for information, but also for inspiration.",1188950400,20,1011,5.0359281437125745
2659541,5,B000IOMZF6,"My name is Tamimae and I am a student of Eva Shaw's.  I have taken two of her classes and I am on my way to begin my third.  If you are looking for an inspiration or a ""nudge"" to write, I recommend any of Eva's Shaw's material.  However if you are a visual person who enjoys learning by sight - I highly recommend this DVD.

I am such a person that learns by touching, seeing, and experience.  I have to admit her bubble method is exciting and it is amazing to watch your ideas flow threw your mind to the paper and see a story involve in front of you with just a few moments of creativity.

Eva Shaw is an inspiration to anyone who is beginning to write.  Her exercises are easy and fun to explore, she gives you confidence by her kindness and through her mentoring.  She is a fantastic teacher and mentor.",1169510400,10,807,4.128205128205129
2659542,4,B000IOMZF6,"Being more left brain than right, I like the method Eva teaches which accesses the right brain. Also, she shows the writer how to break a project down into small increments which are within the realm of accomplishment. And knowing this is what she does, and has done so very many times, it's got to work for me too.",1166054400,9,315,4.3559322033898304

8146700,3,B000IOMZF6,"good dvd, but too short and not quite what I was expecting, is your average writing for newbies workshop on video !",1396051200,,115,4.2727272727272725

8146702,2,B000IOMZF6,"I am sorry to say I was deeply disappointed in this DVD. It is an amateur video and covers a brainstorming style that every high school student has been introduced to already. I had hoped for more original material, but there was nothing in this DVD that your English teacher hasn't covered for you.",1336089600,6,299,4.555555555555555
8146703,4,B000IOMZF6,"Eva Shaw's ""Write Your Book in 20 Minutes"" provides tried and true information about mindmapping (AKA the Bubble Method) which acts to simplify the writing process for authors of fiction and non-fiction alike.  Though some of the examples are a bit drawn out, the overall presentation is useful and informative.",1249430400,2,311,5.22
