5339976,4,B009INAL0E,"I knew nothing about this movie when I bought it. I just wanted more Hallmark movies in my collection. It was obvious from the cover who the female lead would end up with, once you found out that Jamie Kennedy played the part of Cupid, so there's not spoiler alert in saying that the woman falls in love with her producer. I couldn't really handle Jamie Kennedyhe's not really an actor. He actually annoyed me. Apart from that, I thought this movie had an original premise and I thought that the female lead was a good actress. I could have done with a little less of her boobs falling out of her dresses, but, whatever.",1388793600,,620,4.4
