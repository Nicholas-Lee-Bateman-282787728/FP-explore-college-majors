1193318,5,B000006D2X,"I came across 'quilombo' after I had read on the internet about the 'palenques' or 'maroons', which were communities made of escaped slaves in Latin America's colonial era. In Brazil, the palenques were known as quilombos, and the most famous to have existed - and featured on the movie -- was that of Palmares in northeastern Brazil. Although the director injects a big dose of magic realism to the movie, it still gives a fairly accurate picture of the times - mid-late 17th century. The hellish conditions endured by slaves brought from western Africa, the Portuguese-Dutch wars, and the human will to break free combined to create the conditions for a slave exodus and a formation of an exile, small republic to form in  a remote hillside in the forests.

The movie centers around two characters that have long lived in the collective memory of Afro-Brazilians for hundreds of years: Ganga Zumba and Zumbi, the former the spiritual leader of his new found nation, the latter the warrior who would resist fiercely the devastating assault unleashed upon the quilombo and its dwellers by a well-armed expeditionary force made up of portuguese troops, colonial regulars and Sao Paolo mercenaries.

'Quilombo' tells a story of defiance, courage, and the fighting spirit of formerly oppressed peoples who chose to die for their freedom rather than returning alive in chains to hell on earth, namely the sugar plantations of Pernambuco province. Palmares defied the Portuguese empire for almost a century, and represented a threat to the province's plantations because they were often raided and the slaves were freed.

For an attempt to publicize this epic era in Brazilian history, Diegues does a good job by putting together historical facts and magic realism. Though I would have loved to see more emphasis on the economic aspects of the quilombo. It is said that 'Palmares' had developed its own business schemes with free-lance merchants and local ranchers as well, creating also not only the threat of slave mutiny but the threat that presented the diversity in crops around the quilombo, which contrasted sharply with the monocultures, thus the economic interests of plantations.

All in all, 'Quilombo' is dramatic, thrilling, and beautiful. For those interested on history about maroon communities and slave resistance in the New World I truly encourage to get this movie.",1096329600,52,2379,5.136950904392765
1193319,2,B000006D2X,"This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying and is worth viewing by the student of colonialism. However, this film -- as a film -- is terrible. The story may stir pride in the heart of Africans, African-Americans, and Afro-Caribbeans, but the production seems almost laughable by today's standards.
The box lauds the ""the pulsing beat of Gilberto Gil's rhythmic musical score."" The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It sounds more like Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Violent battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop beats, complete with sythesizers. Admittedly, the lyrics -- which are subtitled -- are moving folk-music tales of the fighters' heroism.
The special effects and staging are highly dated at best and absurd at worst. While they may appeal to those who claim to be steeped in African spiritualism, they alienate a more critical viewer. Rather than invoke mysticism and atavistic beliefs, they make the film look cheap. For example:
-- Spears turn to fire in the hands of warriors.
-- Children ""fight"" slave catchers by turning cartwheels and bewildering their enemies before jumping on them all at once. (And these slave catchers have muskets, which they infrequently use.)
-- The lighting effects used to create a conversion between the present king (Zumbi) and the deceased king (Ganga Zumba) are like something out of a high school video project.
I cringed watching the director's portrayal of daily life within the commune of Palmares. The video box calls it ""carnival madness."" That's exactly what it is. There are countless scenes of dance parties in which the Palmarans paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of '80s pop music. Moreover, where is the real daily life? What is it actually like in Palmares? The freed slaves have an abundance of oversized and colorful vegetables, but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. The king also advocates a naive and benign socialism, which may or may not have prevailed in the real Palmares. Am I really to believe that all food was commonly owned, even that which was privately grown?
As a professional historian and an expert on colonialism, I am glad that I watched this film. On the other hand, as a professional historian, I did not come away from the film with the view that is the way it truly was. The film's depiction or moralizing is far too simplistic; and the music/special effects deny it a quality of reality. Both the box of the video and other reviewers compare this tale to ""Roots"" by Alex Haley. In terms of story, that may be so, but ""Roots"" never seemed to border on farce.",1079568000,21,2752,4.882478632478633
1193320,5,B000006D2X,"As an individual who is initiated into a traditional African Spiritual system, this film touched me deeply.  The validity of not only the film's historical content, but the authenticity of the films spirituality was  refreshing.
I recommend this film to anyone who is interested not only in  history, but in the retention of traditional african culture and  spirituality in this part of the world.

1193321,3,B000006D2X,"""Quilombo"" is a historical movie about slavery in Brazil. The movie has a great story to tell about the evils of slavery and how a few Brazilian slaves were able to escape and start a new life and community  based on freedom and equality.  It's too bad the acting in this movie isn't  that great.  Many of the scenes in the movie are over dramatic and  unrealistic.  However, ""Quilombo"" does offer some insight into  Brasilian slave culture.",923011200,5,441,4.64935064935065

Set in brazil this film is spoken in mainly  portugues, but it is worth the slightly annoying english subtitles.  In  fact, the film is so glorious in just its presentation that the film is  still a treat with the sound off.

7904176,1,B000006D2X,The DVD is in Portuguese !!!  It seems to me that DVD's marketed to a English speaking audience would be in that language but this one isn't. It might be a great DVD but I can't understand it !!!  I wish I had been told that in the advertisement before purchasing.,1395273600,,264,4.1568627450980395

7904178,1,B000006D2X,FIRST IT DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME AND I WOULD LIKE THE ADDRESS TO RETURN IT.  THE SYSTEM DID NOT WORK TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  IT WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR CLASS AND I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.,1364342400,,193,3.8
7904179,5,B000006D2X,"It is a commonly believed throughout the Afro-Diaspora that Africans and most of their descendants (except for a few revolts) simply accepted their lots as slaves. This is totally not true. If you watched Roots and it made you angry. Then you saw Sankofa and it made you hopeful. Quilombo will make you proud for one, because it is actually based upon historical events.

The film was made in typical Brazilian style and will appear almost like a low-budget 1960-1970s flick because the director was trying to show the difference between normal conscious and spiritual possession.  This is when the orishas - the divinities/angels of the Yoruba pantheon - possesses the devotees and inspires them to fight for their liberation.

As I stated before, this movie will make you proud and will make you want to learn about other ways African people resisted and fought against slavery. For instance, when I learned that the character Zumbi in the movie is the legendary famed folk hero sung about in Capoeira Ngula (Angola), I was like floored, because it gave me a different appreciation and perspective about the art.

I recommend this movie to anyone and encourage those that have it to share it with others. In fact, I would recommend that it be shown during Black History Month like other films of the same genre and also be shown on November 20, which is Brazil's Day of Black Consciousness in honor of Zumbi.

Again, share not give this movie away y'all know how folks are when it comes to borrowing. :)",1262649600,4,1505,4.773076923076923
7904180,5,B000006D2X,This movie was spectacular!!! It was encouraging to know and see slave revolts that lead to triumph for the African people. It depicts a historical account and illustrates to the viewers that not all Africans layed down and allowed themselves to be conquered.,1203465600,,259,5.046511627906977
7904181,5,B000006D2X,"Based on true events, I thought this film was unforgettable.  It depicts a charismatic Black leader in 17th century Brazil who persuades the slaves to revolt and move to the uplands to build villages free from contact with the white Portuguese.  Another central theme is the contrast between the empty faith of (some of) the missionaries versus the vibrant religion of the tribal peoples. Of course, the idea of resistance to tyranny is depicted in many films; but those things which make ""Quilombo"" different are the spectacular costumes, paints, music, and dance. The photography of Brazilian landscapes is similarly splendid. Few films are such a treat for the senses. I am delighted that the VHS version was finally converted to a DVD.",1127952000,18,739,5.049180327868853
7904182,4,B000006D2X,"I saw this movie at a film festival last month. ""Quilombo"" portrays the slave revolts in Brazil during the 17th century. Africans were enslaved to fuel Europe's economy abroad and in the colonies. They refused to be shackled and treated like cattle. It took the strength of our people to fight against their oppressors and form communities to maintain their culture and customs.

They were seen as savages because they possessed a great deal of power and refused to succumb to the powers that be that were using them to build their economic wealth. Perhaps if some of us could live like maroons, we can reflect on ourselves and help one another as they did. We can also challenge the power structure that continues to bring us down.

Although the movie was very interesting to watch, it was a bit Hollywood. The background music was too tropical for that period.",1120780800,8,862,4.74
