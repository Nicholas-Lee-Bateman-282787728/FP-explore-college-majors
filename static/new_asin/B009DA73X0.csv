8540120,3,B009DA73X0,"Underbelly is not the Sopranos, The Wire or the Shield, it is not that good. Having said that it's Ok, its just a run of the mill gangster show which is not saved by either it's Australian setting or the fact that it's based on real events. Beware much of the story is open to question. These are after all professional criminals who lie as a matter of course.

If you like Aussie crime series try Blue Murder (not the British series of the same name) or the Great Bookie Robbery both of which are like underbelly based on real events and much better viewing.",1377561600,,559,4.3238095238095235

As my review for the ""import version"" may be getting lost, I thought I would keep K. Harris company over here!

Pros:

1.) There was a good deal of nudity & violence

2.) The filming technique reminds me of a Guy Ritche movie

3.) Shows how unorganized ""organized crime"" crime can be

4.) Really good soundtrack

5.) I increased my knowledge of Australian slang

Cons:

1.) It was difficult to figure out the actual organizational structure of the ""Moran Mob"" (referred to in the series as the ""Carlton Crew""). With the exception of the Loan Sharking (Mario) and the attempt of the Moran Brothers to get into the ""X"" business, it was difficult to ascertain what everyone else was into. I couldn't even figure out to the last disc that Mick was the defacto head of the crew. Perhaps it is me, though I tend to like details and enjoy doing the ""math"" re: ill gotten gains. Unless I missed it there were only 2 references to money/profits (other than the cost of having someone killed): interest rates that Mario charged and some loose references to the production costs versus sale price of ""X""

2.) For mobsters these guys were sorely lacking in the personal protection arena. No bullet proof cars, trained body guards, etc. Alphonse (AKA ""The Black Prince"") was the only one that even seemed to have a home security system, which apparently doesn't alert you when the front door is left open! Also, I don't think that I saw anyone ""sweep"" for listening devices! Perhaps things are done differently in Australia, however, anywhere else in the world and relative to the money that some of these guys were supposedly earning, I would have thought that they would have protected themselves better

All in I would give the series 4-1/2-stars, though still falling short on an aggregate basis to the Sopranos (some seasons were better than others).",1366848000,3,1859,4.7601246105919
