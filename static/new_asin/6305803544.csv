7894893,5,6305803544,"I really like this movie because it teaches about teamwork and working together as a team about sportsmanship even though it is not that easy to try again, again!",1410739200,,162,4.620689655172414
7894894,1,6305803544,"Unbelievable, unoriginal, unreasonable and unsatisfying. The baseball looks fake,the emotion seems forced, the timing of the humor seems off and the ending seems abrupt.",1340668800,,169,6.083333333333333
7894895,5,6305803544,An excellent teaching tool for my students with special needs. It is a feel good about yourself movie that encourages being the best you can be no matter what.,1339372800,,159,4.517241379310345
7894896,5,6305803544,"We enjoyed the movie theme and the looking out for those maybe not as large or as athletic as the next kid, and show that they have a place to shine as well.",1318809600,,157,3.787878787878788
7894897,5,6305803544,Great movie for old and young baseball fans. Saw it when it first came out and it was great.,1295395200,,92,3.8947368421052633
7894898,1,6305803544,"Watched this movie with my seven year old son. It exposed him to all sorts of themes that I just didn't want him to see. For a young baseball player, the movie introduces the concept of ""loser"" and just won't let go of it.  Irritating as a parent. I spent the movie talking him thru dialogue just to keep him positively directly.  Avoid this movie if you have a young kid just learning baseball.  There's plenty of fun positively directed baseball films out there.",1119744000,4,464,4.5
7894899,2,6305803544,"Not only is this movie unoriginal and superficial at its very core, but also its logic is flawed and it is not really a good kids movie.
There are far too many prototypes: the not-so good team coached by a washed-up ex-minor league player, the ""evil"" coach who has won a string of championships that wants to ""rule"" the baseball league with another title, the ""heart-broken"" kid who wants to win for Dad, the mom who wants the best for her little boy, the rise and fall of the ""lovable loser"" type team, etc. It seems to all be a bunch of one-dimensional and predictable characters that begin to work each and every baseball clich&eacute;.
I agree with the reviewer, Brett,  who mentioned the flawed logic of this movie. It's hard to exactly know what the message of this movie is.  Do the parents want their team to win? Do they want their kids to practice, not to practice? Why do they want them to quit a game that is a passion just because some coach tells them they aren't good enough? The naivety of this movie excels all baseball movies I've seen.  Couldn't they put a little more thought into some of these characters?
The slight positive to this movie were the few chuckles that were there. Ed Asner does a decent job as the ex-minor league player turned coach, and has a few good lines:
""Baseball is spelled F-U-N-D-A-M-E-N-T-L-E"" ..
 ""Can you spell irritating, kid?""
However, overall, the lines and the action aren't fun, but rather superficial, and it's ending left me, well, confused (kind of like they just said, ""Let's stop the movie right here.""). A movie that could have been much more, but failed miserably.
Even if it is just suppose to be a fun movie, Perfect Game doesn't even come across as a true kids movie. I would suggest that if you want a kid's movie with a little more spirit, rent ""The Rookie"" instead. If you are wanting a good baseball movie period, see ""The Natural"" or ""Field of Dreams.""",1081296000,3,1921,4.543352601156069
7894900,5,6305803544,"There are all too few movies around that we can take the kids to.  And many of them are tough for adults to sit through.  Thankfully, this one is a gem.  Ed Asner is charming as always and Patrick Duffy makes a great bad  guy.  But the kids are the stars of this story of a young boy who just  wants to be one of the team.  Don't miss this one.  It'll make a great  addtion to the kids' video library.",956188800,2,401,3.8518518518518516
