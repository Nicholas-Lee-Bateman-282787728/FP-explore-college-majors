8061975,1,B0009JN72A,"I have beem studying martial arts for approximately 15 years and specificly Hapkido for about 8 years. As far as this series is concerned, was supremely dissapointed. I thought that coming from Black Belt I couldn't go wrong. Well the video / sound quality were the only part of this series that was of any quality. But the content and imformation was severly limited and the actual techniques demonstrated are less than worthless. I agree with the previous reviewer. Pleade, do your self a huge favor and skip all the videos from this series.",1480377600,,543,4.787234042553192
8061976,1,B0009JN72A,"Bottom Line:  Waste of Money (Get Hapkido Ultimate Self-Defense by Steve Sexton instead; that's amazing)

Here's a summary :
-Misrepresentation
-No close up
-No different angles
-Poor execution by colored belts (Mike and Larry)
-Unrealistic techniques

My Qualification: I have practiced/practicing, karate, tkd, judo, and hapkido.

Details:
-Misrepresentation: Jong Bae Rim does not teach in the video, regardless of the cover which shows him throwing Joe Sheya and giving him credit for the DVD.  RIm is amazing.  I have seen him perform on youtube.  There is just some old clip where he is seen for few seconds.  Where I come from this is known as FRAUD.

-No close up.  The camera stays about 10 feet or so away and never zooms in.  It is a mystery as to where the hand, finger... are positioned for a lot of these techniques.  That may be OK for striking martial arts (not really).  But is NOT OK for styles like Hapkido which is pain and leverage based.  There is little explanations as to what the proper placement is.  I study martial arts that use joint locks and manipulations and I have competed in Judo tournaments as well.  I can honestly tell you that a half inch off can be the difference between whether you get the lock or not.  The technique is worthless without that specific detail and proper execution.  On the streets, it can mean your life.

-No different angles.  Same reasons as above ""No close up"".

-Poor execution by colored belts (Mike and Larry).  When I pay money to buy an instructional dvd or take classes, I want to see experts to teach me how to do it correctly.  About half of the techniques are done by 2 brown belts named Mike and Larry who do it WRONG.  Shea fixes their mistakes every time.  But that one mistake is not all they make.  Shea doesn't point it out.  I watched this dvd BEFORE I started hapkido/judo/jujitsu (but with background in karate and judo), and to my untrained eyes, they looked sloppy.  But now, I see the mistakes that they are making.  This is outrageous.  I have no problem having colored belts do the techniques, but they need to so it correctly.

-Unrealistic techniques:  Some of these techniques are unrealistic to use in a fight.  I am very doubtful whether any of these guys ever used them in a real street fight.  The precedence in defense is avoid, evade, block.  The simulated attacks are so fake; slow and far away from the defender.  The attacker flips over at the slightest touch.  The punches never make it to the face , for instance.  I practiced jujitsu knife (plastic) defense where the attacker is less than arms length away and come in full force.  If I don't evade, I get stabbed a little (it's ok, it's plastic), then I do my technique to train muscle memory.

There's other problems with the DVD, but the above that I mention deal with the core content and whether they are worthy.  I don't expect Hollywood quality film, but do expect quality instructional dvd that teaches me hapkido.

Because of my background in hapkido, judo, jujitsu, I can figure out many of these moves.  I regret buying this dvd.  I will not buy the others in the series.  I will not buy anything produced by Sheya.

Mr. Sheya, you seem like a nice guy on the DVD, but you have no business producing HapKiDo DVDs.  And Mike and Larry, ... well, good luck with your hapkido.  Hope you never have to use it.

I want my money back.  Including shipping!",1389916800,,3411,4.584717607973422
