8635415,4,B00HSHPYK4,"Serenity was in a class far, far above the rest.  It probably should have been cast w/out Fillion.  He had a good moment here and there but the humor was a mismatch for his acting and his character.  Honestly, I was missing Stana Katic, I just couldn't help myself.
Spoiler Alert-
In one action sequence, he survives being shot in the back, AND impaled with a wakizashi.  He walks away intending to fight some more.
""River"" was played very well by a surprisingly young and good actress.  ""I swallowed a bug,"" she manages to detach herself from the other characters very well as her character demands it.  I love her athletic ability, but her first fight scene was Hollywood choreography and subpar.  Her technique lacked the body mechanics of a real martial artist and even a layman could pick that out-not really her fault.
Initially, the story was long as it just kept unfolding.  It managed to keep a good balance and pace but it felt like the movie was just too long, it felt like a 3.5/4 hour movie.  Ironically, i watched it again an it went by seemingly quick.  It felt like a 30/45 minute program, program, NOT a movie.
""River"" made this a success, my hat's off to this fine young actress and she had the help of a decent storyline.
I think this movie would have gone over better if it was rated ""R"" and had the elements to make it so.
The Rock's movie had such **** poor characterization, I struggled to keep watching the movie.  It was the worst of the others and none of them came close to two stars.  They're all just time wasters.",1510185600,,1543,4.432624113475177

8635419,3,B00HSHPYK4,"My main reason I bought this was for ""Hellboy and the Golden Army. I didn't like ""Doom"" and ""Pitch Dark"" was a poor ""B-rated"" movie. The pilot ""Serenity"" lead up to ""Firefly"" the series which I liked.",1486339200,,200,4.4324324324324325
