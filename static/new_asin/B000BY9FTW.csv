There is no funnier one year series out there than this series.  It is actually similar to real life mistakes and mishaps than a written comdey.  Go with the flow and enjoy a rollicking good laugh with friends.",1242777600,2,249,4.767441860465116
2446124,2,B000BY9FTW,i got it super cheap here though so not the end of the world. there was one episode that was hilarious start to finish but the others were hit and miss.,1236643200,,152,3.935483870967742
2446125,1,B000BY9FTW,"I bought this series after reading the favorable reviews posted on Amazon.  I enjoyed the series Sons and Daughters and read that this series also had improvised dialogue.  I figured the fact that Fred Goss was involved in both series would give this a similar feel.  Not so - save your money and time.  If you want to hear adults feel sorry for themselves and not laugh, purchase Friends.  This will undoubtedly become a cult hit in France.",1182729600,2,441,4.602564102564102
2446126,5,B000BY9FTW,"I happened upon this DVD purely by accident. I saw Nicole Randall Johnson (of MADtv) on the cover and I am becoming a big fan of hers. I also noticed the Shout! Facory logo on it and knowing the stellar series they have produced (""Freaks and Geeks,"" ""Undeclared"" and especially ""The Job"") I decided to take the chance. As far as I am concerned, Shout! is now 4 for 4, this show is simply fantastic.

This show is done in odd form (and I mean that in a good way). It follows the marriages of four separate couples. The only thing they have in common is the therapist they all go to, the four couples have NO interaction what-so-ever. Each episode focuses on three of the four couples.

The couples are all hilarious and mostly well-matched. My favorite couple is Bill and Connie. Bill (played by the, in my opinion, genius Fred Goss) is unemployed and in a dark abyss of depression. The opening scene between he and Connie is one of the funniest segments I have ever seen. The next couple (and the only couple featured in every episode) is James and Chelsea. It is easy to see why they enjoy most of the screen time as the actors, Brian Palermo and Andrea Savage, have the best chemistry of anyone on the show. Their back-and-forth is absolutely top shelf. The other couples, Devon (Chris Spencer) and Alex (Nicole Randall Johnson) and Ethan (Herschel Bleefeld) and Eleanor (Faith Salie) are fantastic but can pale in comparison to the others.

The topics range from infidelity to divorce to pregnancy to Fred Goss dancing around in skimpy underwear. It is completely hilarious and I could not recommend it any more. Only 12 episodes got made (Shout!, while maintaining a high quality, cannot keep a show in the air) which is a crying shame. If you like anything Shout! has ever done, you will not be disappointed here.",1173225600,5,1818,4.587692307692308
2446127,3,B000BY9FTW,"If you like watching 5 minutes of MANDATORY trailers each time you play a DVD - this is the one for you!!

Sig Others is great -- but SHOUT!! (the releasing company) should realize that the only mandatory playback should be the FBI warning - NOT their trailers.  Consumers buy content, not promos.

Just wait for the repeats on BRAVO and TIVO them.",1140134400,5,348,4.492063492063492
2446128,5,B000BY9FTW,"If you're a fan of shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, The Simpsons, The Office and the like, you'll lurrrrve this show. It's largely improvisational, and every single episode had me wheezing with laughter-induced asthma.",1139184000,13,240,5.694444444444445
2446129,5,B000BY9FTW,"Seriously, this is the funniest frigging show I've seen come out in the last couple of years. Can't WAIT to get this DVD. The concept is totally original--it alternates between seeing these couples in their everyday lives, and seeing them in the therapist's office--except you the viewer are in the therapist's seat, because the couples are talking right into the camera. The improv is relentlessly brilliant--if you're a Gen-Xer or thereabouts, they nail the humor. For points of reference, I'm a huge fan of SNL and Family Guy.",1136332800,13,529,5.0227272727272725

8094117,5,B000BY9FTW,"This was one of the funniest shows on cable television, and held so much promise that I can't believe it was cancelled. I have this on DVD somewhere, but I've worn it out and am in dire need of a replacement. This show gives a tongue-in-cheek peek at dysfunctional marriages everywhere, and kind of proves the point that there is no such thing as normal. Get this for an evening of binge watching, it's that funny!!!",1466985600,,416,4.4868421052631575
8094118,5,B000BY9FTW,"This should have been a huge hit, it was VERY funny!",1457740800,,52,3.8181818181818183
8094119,5,B000BY9FTW,"This is my favorite show of all time. Hilarious!  It was well ahead of its time, and the genre of mockumentaries and mock-reality shows became mainstream a few years after this show went off air.",1440288000,,195,4.571428571428571
8094120,5,B000BY9FTW,"I have yet to meet anyone else who has seen or even heard about this series. I don't know myself how I stumbled upon it, but I watched it when it was airing on Bravo and thought it was one of the funniest shows I'd ever seen. When it was released on video, I jumped at the chance to own it, and it's one of my favorite go-to shows. In fact, I'm watching it again right now. It's funny, unique, irreverent, innovative -- it's just the best. The only drawback is that there aren't more episodes. I highly recommend it.  I also love shows like News Radio, The New Adventures of Old Christine, Wings, Parks and Recreation, and Spin City -- if you like these, I'll bet that you'll love Significant Others. Give it try. I think you'll be glad you did.",1432425600,,745,4.246478873239437
8094121,1,B000BY9FTW,"I could barely watch the first three episodes before I trashed it. It is not funny, it is not well done, the acting is decent I guess but the characters are pathetic individuals with no depth.",1406332800,,192,4.361111111111111
8094122,5,B000BY9FTW,"I wish people would stop stealing it from me...  I'm about to buy my third copy of this because it's so incredibly funny.  Apparently, it's funny enough that people keep borrowing it and never bringing it back.  The skits are put together in such a clever way.  I loved this show and wish it hadn't gone off the air.",1364774400,,316,4.305084745762712
8094123,4,B000BY9FTW,"Great series. Smart, witty, and extremely well written. If only it had gained more popularity; I would have loved to have seen at least two more seasons to see how the characters were developed. Reminds me a bit of what Modern Family is today.",1296259200,2,243,4.545454545454546
8094124,5,B000BY9FTW,"Before ""The Office"" and ""In Treatment,"" Bravo put a group of comedian-couples on the couch for an inventive, improvised show about couples in therapy. You'll recognize some of the principals from commercials and from bit parts in movies and TV shows that have a quirky, improvised comedy feel. And others you won't recognize from anything, but you'll wish for more of them, somewhere, anywhere. This is a rare show about ""attached life"" that doesn't alienate single viewers and that tells all the couples out there, ""it's not just you."" Dysfunction leads to hilarity and occasionally the awkward laugh, but in a really good way. This is one of my all-time favorite shows, and if you're like me, you'll find yourself incredulous and disappointed that the show only lasted one season...like I said, ahead of its time.",1292889600,2,815,5.0
8094125,5,B000BY9FTW,I really enjoy this show. Too bad it was so short-lived. The price was good. The DVD quality was very good.,1244851200,,107,4.142857142857143
