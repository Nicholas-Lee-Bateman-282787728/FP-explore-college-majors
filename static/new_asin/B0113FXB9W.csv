7323671,5,B0113FXB9W,"This series is just fantastic. From the performances, to the set, to the well-written script, peppered with wit, it is a notch above the other sword and sorcery series' out there, including Game of Thrones. This is the kind of class act you expect from the BBC and the producer of Downtown Abbey.  Based upon the Saxon Series novels by British writer Bernard Cornwell (of which The Last Kingdom is the first in the series, although Season one covers the first two books), the series stays close to the flavor of the books, each episode depicting 9th century Britain and exploring timeless themes of heroism, loyalty, war, and faith. Here, battle is not glorified, but bloody and often tragic; characterizations are never shallow and motivations are complex.

The story explores the life of Uhtred, a young Saxon, whose family is killed by raiding Danes (Vikings) and he is kidnapped into slavery at about aged 12. His intelligence, good will, and charm, endear him to his owner, Ragnar Ragnarson, a Viking warlord, who raises him as a son. But when opposing Danes also slaughter his adoptive family when he is about twenty, he must find his way in the world and his way back to Bebbanburg - his father's Saxon fort, which is his by birthright but has been taken by his treacherous uncle. The trouble is, the Danes see him as a Saxon, and the Saxons take one listen to his Danish accent and one look at his Danish dress and mannerisms, and see him as the enemy. A man without a country, rejected by both cultures, Uhtred must prove himself at every turn, trying to win the trust of King Alfred while warring with demons within himself. This happens against the historical backdrop of the struggle of Wessex the last of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to stand against the warring Danish invasion, to unite the Anglo-Saxon peoples and establish an England under one king.

Amongst the many outstanding performances is that of the lead, Alexander Dreymon as Uhtred of Bebbanburg, who brings nuance and layers upon layers of emotion and humor to his role. Others worth mention here are that of David Dawson as King Alfred the Great, and Adrian Bower as Leofric, warrior and Uhtred's good friend.

This is escapism at its best. Women will enjoy the eye candy that Alexander Dreymon provides and the romance, while men will love the politics and rivalries and impeccably realistic battle scenes. Be warned that the violence, while never gratuitous or frivolous, is realistic. These are early medieval battles, and they are brutal. Probably not suitable for children under 12  or 14.",1441670400,4,2569,4.829545454545454

7323677,5,B0113FXB9W,"Based on the book series by Bernard Cornwell, The Last Kingdom is filled with rip-roaring action and plenty of drama. Mr. Cornwell is a descendant of our hero Uhtred of Bebbenburg, which meant his research was thorough and careful. The televised series covers two books each season, which means that parts had to be edited out. The main characters and events are all there, however, and the story is vividly told. The acting is just fine, though Alexander Dreymon as Uhtred seems to drift a bit in and out of a Danish accent. David Dawson is excellent as the pious Alfred, who is determined to unite all the elements of Britain into one country. Uhtred, as a brash and impulsive warrior, is his polar opposite, yet is continually drawn back into Alfred's cause - usually reluctantly. And I enjoyed the fact that many of the female characters are as fierce and as strong-willed as the men. As a side note, some of the most amazing looking actors in Hunkdom were cast in this! An exciting series; I was delighted to learn a third season is being filmed.",1531526400,,1051,4.625668449197861

7323707,4,B0113FXB9W,It is good but I liked the books better. Perhaps it is because after many years of reading the series my imagination is indelibly fixed on specific mental images that the film fails to live up to.

However, how on Earth am I supposed to watch a series about Uhtred, the Saxon boy turned Dane, returned to reclaim his title, when he is such an unlikeable guy?  He turns on just about everybody that is decent to him by the end of the season.  He kills a worker for stealing timber, saying the theft is terrible, then murders an entire village to steal their silver - and keep the beautiful sorceress, of course.  He is told how to build an army, work his way up, and get power, but doesn't like waiting, so immediately goes his own way - and gets everyone hurt.  The other characters are all portrayed as sneaky or creepy religious zealots.  There was just no one left to root for - save maybe Uhtred's infant son, whom he abandons.",1511827200,,808,4.425675675675675

I will say at the beginning it was hard to grasp, bounced around a lot and started stories in the middle of their story. It was hard to keep up with who was who and where, what, why. BUT we have pushed through and have gotten swepted up into the story, the actors are normal-real looking, very real acting emotions and the fighting scenes....well they looked pretty real getting a sword through the throat. The stories do come around and you can understand what's going on, definitely not as grandeur as Vikings, but more real looking and different spin on the story.

Netflex or whoever, would really be kinda silly for not putting out more seasons.  Vikings have been a mystery to me, and as a Christian, I do like to explore both sides.  But the Avengers series has put the vikings gods in proper prospective, they are cartoon characters and that is all.

Alexander Dreymon makes a fine young Uhtred (he could be an inch taller, I suppose) and the actors who play Beocca and the King are excellent.
Production values are very good. I can't say exactly why, but this series feels more like the books than the Sharpe series.

One thing largely absent are the in your face shield wall bludgeonings that characterize the novels. When Uhtred fights, he's a bit of a choreographed superhero.",1495584000,,646,4.657894736842105

7323814,4,B0113FXB9W,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this series there are some weak spots which truly annoyed me because - well - it could have been much, much better. Please don't get me wrong as it is very good and far superior to most of the tripe that is on television these days but it could have been better. First, and sad to say, Alexander Dreymon really hasn't filled out his character as well as one would expect, especially given these excellent books the story is based on. In fact, I would say he was miscast as he just doesn't look the Viking type, much too pretty, and his portrayal of Uhtred just isn't course, hard, harsh enough. And, his costumes, as well as Emila Cox's, who plays Brida (excellently in my opinion as is Ian Hunt (of course!) and David Dawson) are too clean, too modern, too Hollywood. I think BBC should have looked to the 'Vikings' a bit more before shooting because they do have an wonderful script and story and director; it just could have been much, much better. So, those are my two annoyances: costumes and a bit of miscasting. The latter isn't all that serious and Dreymon does a fair job but when compared to the 'Vikings' which is almost perfect...well, it could have been much, much better but it's still very worthy entertainment.",1490659200,8,1253,4.548672566371682
7323815,2,B0113FXB9W,"I guess I am not a fan of BBC TV shows. I have tried several. The protagonist of the show makes so many dumb choices that it's hard to find him appealing.

7323817,1,B0113FXB9W,"Christian viewers BE WARNED! This is horribly anti-Christian. That didn't come across fully in the first episode so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and bought the rest of the series. By half way through episode 2 I knew I couldn't watch the whole lot.
A lot of the anti-Christian stuff is quite subtle and cumulative. Time after time Christian characters and Christian faith are shown negatively. For example, in 'The Last Kingdom', in episode 1, the priest almost drowns the boy while baptising him - it's supposed to be funny, but it portrays him as totally stupid. The Lord's wife is presented as a hysterical Christian women thinking prayer could help them - again, that's supposed to be funny. Plus she wants the boy re-baptised - how silly of her. And so it goes on. All things that would be fine here or there, since some Christians will be silly, or hysterical, or stupid, but it's always the Christians presented that way, not the Vikings. There's no balance, it's totally skewed. I have since read in reviews that they even give the Pagans real 'magic' such as visions and so on, and that the Christians never get anything like that.

Plus there's the scenes like the Martyrdom of St Edmund, though one can hardly call it a martyrdom, the way they portray it, which just use the Vikings to mock the Christians in a supposedly acceptable way, because 'Vikings did that sort of thing' (reminds me of the scene at Mass in 'Vikings'). Yes, they did do that sort of thing, but you don't have to present it as being okay.

Also I find The Last Kingdom (just like Vikings) to have a twisted attitude to the Vikings. The audience is clearly invited to take pleasure in the Vikings' murder, rapine and plunder, again, under the excuse that it's just historical. No surprise really, when our culture thinks it's okay to have video games where people pretend to be a bad guys, and take pleasure in killing loads of people in the pursuit of selfish goals. Yes, Vikings did these things, so show why they thought it was okay in their culture, whilst making it clear that it isn't. It is possible to do that.

It took me a while to accept what I was picking up on, in anti-Christian terms, when watching Vikings, because otherwise I was enjoying the show (though the violence is often gratuitous), but once I was tuned in to the anti-Christian stuff it was impossible to tune it out again, and probably why I picked up on it much quicker when I started watching 'The Last Kingdom'. It's subtle, and corrosive, and personally I would rather watch nothing than watch programmes like that.

I have since read that Bernard Cornwall's books, on which this were based, are very anti-Christian. There were some danger signs in episode one, so I should have guessed. So I would seriously have to advise against anyone watching The Last Kingdom (or Vikings). For fairnesss sake, I will note that I stopped watching slightly before the end of the first season of 'Vikings' and half way through episode 2 of The Last Kingdom so it is just possible that it improves. But somehow I suspect both series start as they mean to go on. Very disappointing indeed.",1490140800,5,3154,4.616755793226382
7323818,5,B0113FXB9W,"A rare confluence of excellence:  excellent story, script, actors, direction, and production values.

Every country was once- at some point in history- a band of smaller tribes, kingdoms or fiefdoms.  A unification story requires well fleshed out characters to bring to life, which The Last Kingdom has, but it has something extra:  a main character who is part of BOTH sides in the fight.

Uhtred is born a Saxon, kidnapped by Danes, raised by them and loyal to them, until disaster strikes.  He has to win the trust back of the Saxons and fight the Danes, while maintaining a couple of lifelong Danish relatives and friends.  He is a brilliant way to explore the character of both sides of the fight for England in the late 9th century.

Next to 'Sherlock', this is one of the best series that I have seen come from the BBC.  It is, in my opinion, very well made.  The acting, costumes, lighting, special effects and scenery are very well done.  How historic the program may be left to be seen, but it is great entertainment.  It may too violent for a younger audience or those with a 'weak' stomach and is DEFINITELY not suitable where sex is concerned.  That's sad, because I know young people that would enjoy this series, but would not be allowed to watch it for the very visual sex scenes.  And that's why the four stars, instead of five.  The sex in this series serves no purpose to the plot line except to attract a few viewers to the program who might otherwise not watch.  The sex could easily be alluded to, but they continue with the entire act and talk of 'plowing' their women.  Get past that and it's a pretty decent program and it's hard not to keep watching episode after episode in a 'Last Kingdom' marathon.",1486166400,,1149,4.419047619047619

I absolutely LOVE it when it feels like characters walked right off the book pages and onto my screen.
This is just such a production.
The season is built with excellent casting, gripping intrigue and battle scenes, engaging characters that help pull one into the drama, instead of mindless bloodshed and gratuitous over-the-top viking sex-scenes. There is even a touch of humour, here and there, which is true to Uhtred's voice throughout the books.
I do truly hope that they will continue to make further seasons, and continue, as much as is possible, to remain faithful to the story told in the book series.
If they do so, we can look forward to YEARS worth of excellence in entertainment, given that this highly entertaining book series is already 10 volumes long.

The protagonist, Uhtred, is realistic with a mixture of arrogance, loyalty, immaturity and determination.  Uhtred grows you and his resemblance is close enough to Matthew McFayden to make him the believable son bent on regaining his families lands.

It's worth a binge watch",1483315200,,503,5.185185185185185

I have read them all.  The story of Utrick of Bebanberg is fiction but the events in which he is part of are real and accurate. The drama is excellent. The battle scenes our fearsome and bloody.  The character development  is outstanding. I cannot say enough about this series. I want to watch it over and over again even though I've read all the books.  I look forward to the next offering. My complaint is about the technical aspects of the desk. The one I viewed  contains no menu calm no way just skip between episodes, no way to jump from one scene to another. One must restart the desk and then either fast forward or usurers seen advance button to go through everything you have seen before to get back where you left off.  There are no extra features. The program would benefit from a background history, a list of characters, and the other things that are found in most of the DVd's of this nature.  It is very hard to follow all the characters without a list of the cast.  Nevertheless this is in the exciting adventure. One worth five stars. Watch it.",1474675200,,1238,4.520179372197309

7323922,5,B0113FXB9W,"Lots of blood-spilling Dark Ages action-adventure in this show, boys. Time to sharpen up your blades, strap on your armor and go out a-plundering!

Bottom Line about The Last Kingdom:

In addition to the plentiful and vivid battle scenes, the casting is strong and the story line is compelling.

The tale swirls around the great contest between Saxon and Dane for mastery of England in the anno domini 800's, and between their conflicting cultural imperatives - Christianity versus the Old Norse religion, their different languages and world views, and of course, who gets the Virgin Cornish Witch Queen?

Special commendations go to Alexander Dreymon in his starring role as the bold warrior Uhtred. Saxon-born but captured and adopted by the Danes, Uhtred in his singular character contains all the complexities and conflicts of the war itself.

Likewise, it would be difficult to imagine a better choice for the role of Saxon King Alfred than David Dawson, who perfectly conveys the  essence of Perfidious Albion with his intelligent, nuanced, and ruthless performance.

And the appropriately named Norwegian actor Rune Tempte is exactly who you would pick for the role of a Mystic Berserker Viking Chieftain.

7323925,5,B0113FXB9W,"Blurb: The Last Kingdom is a ten episodes historical series based on The Saxon Stories (9 books) by Bernard Cornwell.
Uhtred Ragnarson (Alexander Dreymon) is born a Saxon; when raiding Danes invade his land, he disobeys his father's orders and goes toward the war; he sees the enemy kill his father and faces the warriors looking for revenge. He fails because he is just a ten-year-old boy.
Earl Ragnar  a Danish warlord  adopts Uhtred; at the beginning, the boy is just a slave, but when he saves Earl's daughter, the warlord starts to look to the boy in a different way. Uhtred becomes Earl's adopted son.
Years pass. Uhtred grows up and watches other Danishes kill his adoptive family. He is accused of his family's death and has to flee with his Brida (East Anglian), his lover and friend. As he doesn't have where to go, he heads to Wessex and joins King Alfred against the Danishes.
A second series has been announced for a 2016 release.
Comment: Set in the late ninth century AD, Danes invade and rule the Anglo-Saxon lands; they are stronger, crueler enemies and pagans.
Uhtred is a brave and wise warrior and good man; however, sometimes he is too nave for a person who has faced so many things since his childhood. He trusts people and pays a high price for it. He knows how to deal with Danishes, but not with Saxons.
The Saxons deceive him and many times you wonder why Uhtred supports so many insults; he is very smart or too stupid. Has slavery broken him? Did he get used to serve? At some point of the story, Uhtred doesn't fit I anywhere; he is neither Danish nor Saxon, even so, he struggles to prove that he is an honest man who just wants to recover what belonged to his family.
It's impossible not to have a connection with Uhtred; he is a complex and captivating character. You don't know what to expect from him; he always does the opposite of what you'd do and it surprises you.
Dealing with real issues like betrayals, losses, and great enemies, Uhtred describes his life among the Danes and the fights between Danishes and Saxons while he tries to find a place to live in.
It's a historical drama, but has its moments of fun; it isn't too heavy like Game of Thrones and boring like some historical series. The series explores England history instead of violence, nudity and sex; there are scenes of sex and violence, but they aren't excessively explored like in Game of Thrones.",1471046400,,2404,4.5625

The acting was good. I enjoyed the storyline. It does not follow the storyline of the books but it is still very good. It may lack some of the intensity of Vikings but well worth the time and money in my opinion none-the-less.,1470528000,,393,4.397260273972603

Unlike series such as the Game Of Thrones you truly get to immerse yourself in the main character and follow his journey. I found myself rooting for Uhtred and for King Alfred as they go through their struggles with leadership and with each other.

**Spoilers below**

I would only like to point out at something that I would have personally liked. I would have certainly preferred Uhtred to stay with Mildrith and not with Iseult. I understand Mildrith's religiousness was kind of a problem towards their relationship, but still... Also, that whole ""converting to Christianity"" thing would have definitely been something worth exploiting, which both Beocca and Mildrith could have helped with! Heck, her becoming godless would have also been a great plot twist! Anyhow, I understand this is just a personal preference and that other may see it differently but well... I also vaguely read something about a season 2, is that really happening? Because if it is, I will surely be first in line, just like Aethelwold!",1469232000,,1001,4.9523809523809526

All of which you might expect, since it's a BBC production, and to this day nobody does historical costume drama like the BBC does, though many others are catching on.

7323956,5,B0113FXB9W,"I really enjoyed the Last Kingdom. There are some similarities to Game of Thrones, but it is based on actual history and there is no nudity and no dragons. Some of the reviewers don't seem to realize that Alfred the Great was a real English king who fought and defeated the Vikings in the 9th century. The story is based on a series of novels called The Saxon Chronicles by Bernard Cornwell. The series was made by the BBC. It is fun, well-acted and has impressive production values for a TV series.

The series covers an overlooked period in English history. Alfred is generally viewed as the first English king, but a movie about his life flopped at the box office in 1969. The Anglo-Saxons were originally fearsome German invaders who started arriving in England after the Romans left in the 5th century. By the 9th century they ruled the whole of England, but they had turned into peaceful farmers and pious Christians. The Saxons were prosperous but they had become soft. They did not have a full-time army and were easy pickings for the pagan Vikings.

The Vikings had defeated all of Englands seven kingdoms apart from Wessex. Wessex is the last kingdom. This series tells the story of the fightback. The hero of this story is Uhtred of Bebbanburg, played by Alexander Dreymon. Uhtreds father was an English king who was killed in battle. Uhtred was taken as a slave, while still a child. He is trained by the Vikings and becomes a warrior. He rejoins the Saxons as an adult and suffers culture shock among the Christians. Alfred initially finds Uhtred a useful military adviser because he understands the Danes. He later becomes a trusted lieutenant. This is a good story well told. The battle scenes are well done.",1468540800,,1723,4.701986754966887

7323967,5,B0113FXB9W,"Just finished Season One and LOVED it. For GoT fans As I heard the author and director for the series say, this is in some ways similar but without the mysticism magic, and also some of the salacious nudity although George Martin's books are still quite the blueprint.

Where this differs is that it is historical fiction, one that is not very well known about the founding of what we call today ""England"". Most of our images of ""Vikings"" are from shows like Black Sailes, or Vikings. But all the raters from the Scandinavian countries, in this case Danish, were considered Vikings and did not know that the single area of southern England was all that was left of what is now the United Kingdom. Peace treaties were made, people were tortured, killed, betrayed, and this adds the element of the interplay between two religions. That which was brought over from the Romans versus the Norse Gods that we are so used to hearing about. It's like Braveheart but against a foreign invader. And the eight episodes are so well-written how little boy of around 11 is taken into a family and treated as a son, only to rediscover his Saxon roots but is un-trusted by both sides.

Cannot wait to read the rest of the series before the next season as this covers the first two books. Definitely for those looking for something to occupy their binge watching while game of thrones and Outlander are on hiatus, look no further. When it is done by the BBC you can count on quality and I imagine many of the actors in this series will go on to do bigger things and become household names.",1467676800,,1572,4.53169014084507

My complaint is that it is as if the writers took the chapters of The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman and shuffled them and wrote a little from each chapter.  It COULD have been SO good, but it isn't well written.  The costumes are a little cheesy and sometimes look like they are from a Halloween costume store. One scene that bothered me the most is when Uthred is talking to Albert and Ihas wrapped his fingers and hands all over the blade of his super sharp sword.  Anyone with any experience with sharp knives know your don't do that. It is odd things like that which makes it a 3 star series instead of a 4 star series.

Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon) is excellently portrayed (I think I'm in love! :), and I gained a new insight into the character of King Alfred, with the sensitivity of the actor's portrayal.

7324054,3,B0113FXB9W,"I've been hoping for this series for a long time - ever since the History Channel gave us their wretched ""Vikings"" series, to be exact.  And now that it's here, I do like it, even though I think it could have been better.

The good - By and large, I think the performances range from good to superb.  King Alfred is particularly well drawn, as are some of the Danish adversaries and Father Beocca.  The production values are excellent, and the show gets a lot of bang for the buck out of what I've read was a fairly low budget.  The writing, based on some of the most vivid historical novels I've read, gets high marks from me as well.  It's also beautifully filmed, with excellent, though infrequent, use of color.

The not-so-good - I'm not at all drawn to Uhtred, the main character, and find myself wondering why the show cast the particular actor it chose.  This series depends on Uhtred to move it forward, and there is more than one ensemble scene in which virtually everyone else involved is more compelling.  It's a problem.  Also, the contrast between the Danes and the Saxons is not as keenly drawn here as it is in the books.  In the books, Uhtred is always comparing the joyous attitude of the Danes to the somberness of the Saxons.  The contrast goes way beyond the difference between paganism and early Christianity, and was beautifully summed up in one brief scene that could certainly have been put in the series.  When the Danes sail by Bebbanburg at the very beginning of Book One, their leader, Earl Ragnar, runs from one end of his longship to the other on the extended oars of his crew.  It's a beautifully written scene, and establishes the Danes not just as ruthless plunderers but as joyous adventurers.  This aspect of the Danes is pretty much lost in the series, which is a shame.  It could have been there.

The bad, but unavoidable under the circumstances - the series is monumentally slimmed down from the books.  The books had a cast of dozens, all beautifully executed by Bernard Cornwell, who excels at character development.  The series, by comparison, has a much smaller ensemble, and some of the best characters in the first two books have gone by the boards.  Still, it's very rare that a film version of anything can stand up to the book or books that inspired it, so I can live with it.

The inexplicable - Uhtred's weapons had names, and his sword, Serpent-Breath, is so anthropomorphised in the books that it is, for all intents and purposes, a character.  Uhtred's seax, named Wasp-Sting, enjoys a similar stature.  This is a wonderful bit of historical color that added tremendously to the books, and which would have added tremendously to the series.  Why this was left out is beyond me.

Still, I am such a devotee of Cornwell's Saxon Tales that I am happy to have this series to watch.  There are nine books so far, so there is plenty more of Uhtred's story to tell.  I hope the BBC tells it.",1458518400,2,2938,4.557251908396947

As I understand it this is the first season & it is a great example of how successful & entertaining a show can be without a huge budget.

7324108,5,B0113FXB9W,"""The Last Kingdom"" is set in the 800s in the Viking infested England. Our fictional hero, Uhtred, is the second son of a king who loses his life To Vikings and then is abducted by the same Vikings. He is reared as a Dane then has to choose between an English life or a Danish one - not an easy choice since neither side trusts him. The story explores history, families, love, lust, loyalty, betrayal, prejudice, and just about every other human condition imaginable. It's unbelievably rich.

This was very well done. It brings alive a time in history that I knew absolutely nothing about. The story is captivating. It's a bit violent and there is some sex and nudity, but I don't think it was gratuitious. The sex isn't steamy Hollywood sex, but a lot more realistic. The people seem like real people, not heroes. They are fleshed out and interesting. It's good story telling. I'm so glad there will be a season two!",1456617600,2,916,4.551515151515152

7324116,2,B0113FXB9W,"Loosely based on/around historic events, this is a story about a medieval man-child that panders to the sensibilities of modern-day man-children. Character development is minimal, at least in the first season--the main character, Uhtred, is a one-note guy from beginning to end. Other characters come in to kill or be killed in various ways to move the plot along. I was rooting for the intended-as-unlikable King Alfred, because he's the only one that shows some intelligence and foresight, although that isn't really delved into by the story either.
The BBC does some great historical fiction series, but this was a miss. For good, intelligent historical fiction, see Wolf Hall instead.",1456099200,2,688,5.263636363636364

7324201,5,B0113FXB9W,"Like many television series it uses lots of characters and some plot from the  books.  But then...
Still, I like this new take on the Saxon Tales by Bernard Cornwell.  Uhtred is so darn loveable. He wants two
things, humping and fighting. Oh, and Bebbanburg is in there somewhere. Bernard Cornwell introduces other
characters as being slow-witted, but Uhtred is just plain dim. You want to give him a good kick in the rear when he blunders
over and over again.  Everybody takes turn lecturing Uhtred. But he has this great smile. (Alexander Dreymon of course.)
Don't ignore young Uhtred, Tom Taylor. He is just a fun and dim-witted.

We meet a bunch of great young actors playing Brida (Emily Cox) and Ragnar the Younger (Tobias Santelman).  They do a great job. You find that you even enjoy Ubba and Guthrum who are the major villains of the series. But, perhaps the real villains are Asser and Alfed the pain in the butt.
David Dawson crafts a somewhat likeable but mostly disgusting Alfred.  He has to keep Uhtred in line when Uhtred wants nothing but to hump and fight without restrictions. After all this is the BBC, so Alfred can't just be a worm with stomach problems. So Alfred more than Uhtred grows the most through the series. In the end he even leads a Saxon charge at Ethandun.  So kudos to a great new BBC series.  I look forward to season 2 whenever we get that one.

I know TV series will be different from the books, but did I read a different book?  Uhtred the Wicked, not Uhtred the Goddless.  In the TV series Uhtred is portray more of a Metro-male rather than the ass kicking and take no name person.  Most importantly, there is no story behind Serpent Breath.  Uhtred and Brida in a bird cage as prisoners while King Alfred wins the day. Last I will stop with the scene of how Uhtred kills Ubba, please give me a break.

7324220,5,B0113FXB9W,"This is the first Series made of eight episodes based on Bernard Cornwells books. It corresponds to the first two (The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman). The bottom line of this review is that this Series is not quite but almost as good as the books, each of which is worth way more than five stars. The Series, which closely follows the books even if there are some omissions, itself qualifies for five stars, for a number of reasons.

First of all, there is the choice of actors, and their respective performances. Some of them are quite superb, such as the ascetic, torn, gifted and ruthless David Dawson in the role of Alfred. Adrian Bower as Leofric, the heros friend and rival warrior, is also excellent, for instance. I had more mixed feelings about others, including Emily Cox as Brida, Uhtred's first love, and Charlie Murphy as Iseult, the beautiful pagan sorceress who knows the future and can save a live, but at a very heavy price however. I found their performance to be sometimes good and sometimes rather bland. I was however not very impressed by Matthew Macfayden in the role of Uthred, ealdorman of Bebbanburg and father of Uthred, the Series hero, maybe because he did not look rough and tough enough, unlike most of the other male warrior characters. The actor playing Aethelwold, Alfreds traitorous and somewhat cowardly nephew who believes that his uncle has usurped his crown, is also excellent.

Then there is Uthred himself, the son of the ealdorman of Bebbanburg (Alexander Dreymon) whose lands and fortress have been stolen from him when a child by his uncle and after the Danes killed his father in battle. While the actor was not at all what I had imagined the young Uthred to look like, his performance is also pretty good. In particular, he does display this mixture of hot headed and headstrong arrogance, of daring and courage that you find in the books. He also has a very straightforward and brutal sense of justice, a deep attachment to the pagan Gods of the Danes which correspond so well to his warrior ethics, unlike the nailed God. Finally, his striving for fame, reputation and money are relentless since they are the means by which he hopes to reconquer his heritage.

In my view, however, the best performances were those delivered by the actors playing the Danes. This was true of Ragnar the Fearless (Tobias Santleman) who captures Uthred instead of killing him, and then brings him up and teaches him to fight like a Dane. You understand rather quickly where his nickname comes from. Ragnar the Younger, son of the other Ragnar, and Uthreds foster brother, is just as impressive and faithfully reflects the book with his fierce sense of honour and loyalty to his kin. Also excellent is the actor playing the ferocious and undefeated Ubba, the last and most ferocious among the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok and their most capable warlord whom Uthred has been advised to never fight against. Guthrum, ruthless, pragmatic and cynical, is also superb and so are a number of others, including one cruel and devious Sword Dane that you will come across towards the end of the Series, but I will mention no more to refrain from spoilers.

However, the Series have somewhat simplified the complex cast of characters that you find in the books. This is in particular the case for the clergy. For instance, while Father Beocca is included in the plot, the Welsh monk and ex-warrior Pyrlig has been excised. This was a bit of a pity in my view, since he was one of my favourites but his absence  and that of a number of other secondary characters such as Steapa,who has been somewhat merged with Leofric - is not crucial. Also absent is Wulfhere, who in fact sided with the Danes against his King.

Then there is the plot and the historical context. Here again, the Director has had to make a number of choices and cut out bits and pieces. By and large, the result is not bad, but there is nevertheless a bit of a price to pay for this.

One is that the eight episodes span a period of some twelve years, from AD 866, when Eoferwic (York) falls to the Danes of the Great Army, to AD 878 when Guthrum is defeated at Ashdown and accepts conversion. As mentioned by another reviewer, you do not really feel the passage of time in the Series. Unless you know the historical context or have read the books before, you could well believe than only a handful of years have passed (i.e. just enough for Uthred the boy to turn into Uthred the Dane-trained warrior). Another consequence of having to make some hard choices is that all the naval scenes featuring Uthred on ships have also been excised.

A third is that the Director has also chosen to simplify and cut some scenes. Those who have not yet Cornwells books will probably not notice. As for the others, the story and the historical period are sufficiently action-packed that it does not show too much. I nevertheless had one regret about the battle of Cynuit, where Ubba is defeated and meets his fate. The battle itself has been almost reduced to a duel to the death between Uthred and the Dane warlord whereas the book shows how this warlord broke the Anglo-Saxon shield wall on his own with his huge battle axe (and the axe in the film is a rather smallish version of this).

In all fairness, however, the battle scenes in general, and those displaying the sheer horror of fighting in the shield wall, are very well presented. When you get to these scenes, you will quickly understand why the release of this film comes with a warning that it is only fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more. The visual effects of the battles and warriors are simply stunning.

So, to conclude what is already a somewhat long review, and in a nutshell: five stars all the same, even if (like me and many others) you have already read the books and found them somewhat richer in content",1453161600,8,5865,4.6253602305475505

 Biggest issue I had with this show was the sexual content, or 'humping' as they like to say in the show :) From reviews I had of this series it makes it sound like there is very little, in the 2 epidsodes I watched there was 3-4 scenes. They are still clothed for the most part so no nudity is scene (one scene shows a breast), but still very much having sex. For a show that reviews say does not have any I was very dissapointed, just because you are not seeing nudity does not mean its not sexual. I really wish movies would get away from thinking they have to have sex in everything to be good, or learn as others have and do it tastefully.

7324245,5,B0113FXB9W,"I'm a huge fan of the book series, so when it was announced that BBC America would adapt the first book for TV, my expectations were reasonably high. The show did not disappoint. I think anyone who loves the first book will love this show. There are some differences between the book and the show- some minor and some not so minor. I believe the show stays as faithful to the book as it possibly can though.

The casting was perfect. Uhtred and Alfred are exactly how I would imagine. Ragnar was well. I don't think it's possible to fault anyone on any of the casting.

There are a few things that they do/don't do, which I was a little disappointed with . . . SPOILERS AHEAD. Everyone in the show speaks English. No effort is made to show the Danes speak Danish and the Saxons speak English- everyone is apparently fluent in English. Despite a few lines spoken by various characters saying 'you speak English very well, yada, yada,' really, everyone speaks English and these are weak attempts to infer that they're really speaking another language. Uhtred's childhood is also sort of skipped over. Don't get me wrong, they hit the highlights, but I think it doesn't really show the ties that the character has to Wessex. The show would have you believe he really had no other choice . . . it mentions but skips over his mother's family. Brida's origin story is altered, and while she is still a bad ass in the show, she is more of a bad ass in the books. Hild is also not really given enough screen time. Hopefully they flesh out her character properly in the next season. The last, super minor, thing is that they changed the initial battle location where Uhtred's father dies. In the book he dies within the city walls of York, in the show he's on a field.

Despite those difference, the show is still amazing and fantastic.",1451952000,2,1827,4.496987951807229

Its sprinkled with lots of assorted carnage which, one assumes, was about par for the course for the times, in between lots of praying by the irritatingly pious Alfred and his court.  The Danes, at this time, are pagan and greatly feared by the Saxons: looking at them one can easily see why.

The minor irritations mentioned above include the fact that the supposed wise Alfred (he reads a lot) seems, as well as being pious, more than a bit thick: e.g. he cant see, apparently, the one particular duplicitous courtier, right before his eyes, who is so odious its obvious hes going to turn traitor sooner or later.

But if you can look past these, in addition to the periodic carnage, there is much to enjoy.  Its quite nice, for instance, to have a historical drama earlier than the Tudors or Plantagenets for once!",1450915200,21,1314,4.703056768558952

7324274,4,B0113FXB9W,"Fans of the History Channel's gorgeous, surreal series Vikings, about the adventures of young Viking leader Ragnar Lothbrok, will get a kick out of The Last Kingdom. The new series is set 70 years after the History Channel's, recounting the Viking invasions of Northern England from the English point of view.
A lush adaptation of Bernard Cornwell's The Saxon Stories novel cycle, The Last Kingdom is a fictionalized fable about a young English nobleman, Uhtred of Bebbanburg (the dreamy Alexander Dreymon from American Horror Story: Asylum), who finds himself in the middle of the dread war between Viking invaders and England's Saxon leaders.
The eight-episode series opens with the arrival of Danish Viking reinforcements in Northern England. Led by the aging Ragnar Lothbrok (Peter Gantzler), they make mincemeat out of the soldiers provided by local leader Lord Uhtred (Matthew Macfadyen), who is viciously killed as 12-year-old Uhtred Jr. watches.
To add insult to injury, Lord Uhtred's lands are usurped by his evil brother, Alfric (Joseph Millson).
Ragnar admires young Uhtred's spirit and adopts him on the condition that he renounce his Christianity. Fast-forward a decade, and Uhtred has grown up into a distinguished pagan warrior. His idyllic life is shattered when Ragnar is betrayed and murdered by a fellow Dane.
Like a mythical hero out of some ancient fable, Uhtred is left without an identity after losing both his Christian and pagan Viking fathers. He wanders south to join the armies of the English king Alfred the Great (David Dawson). But his true intention is to avenge both fathers and reclaim his land.
The Last Kingdom isn't in the same league as that other medievalesque literary adaptation Game of Thrones, nor does it have the epic scope of Vikings.
But its breathtaking photography, glorious fight scenes, and fantastical story make it a worthwhile treat for genre fans.",1450483200,,1902,5.198697068403908

7324282,5,B0113FXB9W,"AD 866. Uhtred, the Northumbrian Ealdorman of Bebbanburg, is slain in battle with raiders and his son, also called, Uhtred, is captured by Danes. Uhtred's spirit amuses one of the warriors, Ragnar, who decides to keep him and raise him as a slave and servant. When Uhtred saves Ragnar's daughter Thyra from another Danish boy, Ragnar adopts him into his household and teaches him the Danish art of war.

A decade later, Ragnar is betrayed and murdered by an affronted rival. Uhtred and a servant, Brida, escape. Learning that his uncle has usurped his father's seat, Uhtred decides to seek refuge in Wessex to the south. With Northumbria and Mercia overrun by the Danes and East Anglia under attack, Wessex is now the last surviving free Saxon kingdom in England. There Uhtred gains service with the king's brother, Alfred. Alfred is a visionary who sees a single great nation called England rising from the ashes of the Saxon kingdoms and the Danish strongholds...a nation that will need a great, first king.

The Last Kingdom is a television adaptation of the novel series of the same name by Bernard Cornwell, Britain's foremost and most popular writer of historical fiction. Cornwell's work has been adapted to the screen before, most notably his Sharpe series (starring a then-unknown Sean Bean) about a fictional officer raised from the ranks during the height of the Napoleonic Wars. The Last Kingdom is an earthier, harsher series where life is cheaper but also arguably more passionate. The series may have been inspired by the success of Game of Thrones, like so many others, but The Last Kingdom differs from them in one key respect: it's very, very good.

The first season adapts the first two novels in the series, The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horsemen. The through-line of the season is Uhtred's attempt to find a home where he can be accepted. Among the Danes, his Northumbrian birth causes some to look down on him, but amongst the Saxons his Danish upbringing is viewed with suspicion. His refusal to convert to Christianity also makes life difficult at the court in Winchester. Several times he offends his patron, Alfred of Wessex (the later King Alfred the Great), and he earns the enmity of several powerful noblemen, such as Odda the Younger. He does take an English wife, which helps with his image, but this causes further problems when their different backgrounds, religions and outlooks clash.

The series is clever enough to paint Uhtred as a deeply flawed human being. He is young and for all of the harshness of his times and the need to grow up quickly he can still be hotheaded, precipitous and foolish. His brashness and bravery is instrumental in achieving several victories and surviving ambushes, but also works against him as he blunders through the intricacies of court politics. Fortunately, various allies such as the priest Beocca and the great Wessex warrior Leofric are on hand to help him survive.

The series succeeds because of excellent writing, which borrows from the books but also mixes in other historical ideas, and tremendous performances. Alexander Dreymon's surly performance as Uhtred kind of grates until you realise he's supposed to be surly and arrogant, and this lessens over the series as he learns (more or less) humility. David Dawson is also nothing less than exceptional as Alfred, the bookish and quiet younger brother of the king who acts as his spymaster and chief diplomat who then unexpectedly is given the throne and crown despite a lack of charisma or battlefield skills. The fact that he somehow overcomes these problems to become the only English king in twelve centuries to ever be acknowledged ""The Great"" at first seems implausible, but his growth and evolution over the eight episodes leaves you in no doubt that this is a great man, a statesman who prefers reasoned dialogue but is prepared to use force when necessary. Adrian Bower gives an excellent performance as Leofric, and Leofric and Uhtred's ""bromance"" gives rise to many excellent moments of humour and comradeship. Female characters are also not forgotten, with Emily Cox giving a convincing conflicted performance as Brida, Uhtred's first love who cannot abandon her Danish ties. Charlie Murphy is also excellent as Iseult, the ""Shadow Queen"" of Cornwall, and Amy Wren gives a dignified performance as Mildrith, Uhtred's highly reluctant bride. Eliza Butterworth also has a tough role as Queen Aelswith, who initially appears to be very one-note, but later nuance is introduced to the character in a convincing manner.

In fact, all of the performances are excellent, helped by the quality script and great production values. The show is clearly made on a much tighter budget than Game of Thrones - the eight episodes in this first season apparently cost considerably less than just two episodes of Thrones - but delivers some impressive sets, visuals and battle sequences anyway.

If there are any weaknesses it's that the show can be a tad confusing at times, especially in its failure to show the passage of time. It's not made clear, for example, that months pass between some of the episodes, leading to the appearance of the Danes making peace and then breaking it almost instantly. There's also an issue with foreshadowing given that Uhtred is established as primarily wanting to retake his homeland of Bebbanburg but this ambition is then put on the backburner for most of the season. If the next season adapts the third and fourth novels in the series (as seems likely), this storyline should return to prominence then.

The first season of The Last Kingdom (****) has a bit of a slow start but then transforms into a highly compelling, enjoyable slice of historical drama. It is available in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) now and will be released in the USA (on DVD only, controversially) on 6 January.",1449964800,124,5845,4.957142857142857
7324283,5,B0113FXB9W,"This series' Season 1 is absolutely fantastic. I am among many fans thrilled that they are planning a season 2.  It is far about Game of Thrones and Bastard Executioner in terms of plot, acting and production. It shines above Vikings for quality of writing and performances. It is based upon the history of late 9th century England, when the Anglo-Saxons banded together from various kingdoms to unite under King Alfred (the Great) of Wessex (the last kingdom not to be overrun by the Vikings) to win and found the country of England. It tells the story of the Anglo-Saxon struggle but also features much about the Danes (Vikings) who controlled much of the British Isles at the time.  The story is centered around actual historical figures, but the protagonist is Uhtred, an earl (ealdorman) and warrior from the north of England, who was kidnapped and raised by Danes as a boy. He constantly struggles to find his own identity/loyalty and re-establish his birthright.  The series features great plotlines, superb acting (standouts are the lead, Alexander Dreymon as ""Uhtred"" and David Dawson as ""King Alfred"", amongst many others), and writing that is only found in such outstanding series as Downton Abbey.  It is no coincidence that the producers of Downton Abbey have brought us this wonderful series as well.",1449964800,47,1314,4.986301369863014

However, I was willing to see if they had a point to it all.  As I see it, they failed there.  The sex/nudity, in particular, was more for gratuity than story.  It could have been implied and would have told the same story.

I lost interest because the writing just flopped over time.  The main character has a charming, boyish likeability that grants him some grace as a youth, then tolerance as a young man, for his less likeable behaviors.  By episode 5, though, I was losing interest in this guy. The story puts him through tremendous challenges, losses, and tests.  It all seems to bounce off his skull with a resounding 'boi-oi-oinng-g-g-g-g'.  He continues to repeat loudly to his understandably weary companions, that he wants his land back, ignoring all the advice he's given on how to go about getting it.  He ignores people he supposedly trusts, when they warn him his obnoxious behavior is counteractive to his goals, then bellyaches about the consequences.  Gradually, I found myself empathizing more with his enemies, who at least had some self-control and intelligence. This guy goes on like he's stuck at age 13.  He never learns to have compassion, or honesty, or any power of self-examination.  When he kills a man for stealing from him, then immediately goes raiding weaker, unsuspecting communities to get ""wealth"" so he can get his land and title back, well, at that point, I just gave up.  This could have been a great story, superbly acted, with a better-written protagonist. And more judicious use of violence, etc.  As it is, Ewwwwww.",1449532800,9,1701,4.874564459930314

7324303,5,B0113FXB9W,"I went ahead and bought it and I was pretty impressed (compared to what you normally come across anyway). The first two things that struck me was that they didn't strap studded biker leather across the Danes, and they only called them Vikings once (so far that I've heard), the line, ""No, they are not here to trade. They are Danes. They come as Vikings!""

The Danes are the antagonists in general, but not all bad. They represented the Church and Christian customs a bit silly... but the idea was to have religion on both sides portrayed with their ups and downs. The Danes are portrayed as having a strong consideration for loyalty, family, and living life. The Christian Saxons are portrayed to have a strong consideration for compassion, faith, and restraint (respective traits opposing each other).
THANK GOD the woman protagonist at the beginning was not a swift, smooth, Elvish archer that killed men left and right.
They also had a proper sword pull from the back, full in-camera view with no tricks, and he never did it in a combat.
The Danes (Vikings) are actually portrayed as much more competent fighters than the Saxons, and were not slobbering hordes of mindless barbarians. In fact, in a (rather crude) philosophical scene, they were portrayed as very clever.

-
Outside of the exactness of the historical background, the accuracy to the series is a bit beyond my general learning (there was a scene in which an ax split a sword, about the biggest flaw I saw), and Lindybeige would flip at the sight of a heel on a boot. But it was clearly not quite as stupid as normal Hollywood style so I was actually able to enjoy historical fiction for once rather than spend my entire time criticizing it.

I'm sure there's more flaws in there that I'm just not noticing, but it shocked me to the core than they seemed to have taken at least some time to divert from Hollywood Vikings and paid at least some attention.",1449187200,,1922,4.647058823529412

I did not know BBC was doing a series, and discovered it quite by accident just this weekend--but I missed the first three episodes and they were no longer available on On Demand. I knew that Amazon would have it--just knew it! And they did. And the series is fabulous! So close to the books! Uhtred is one of the most likable characters you will ever meet in a book or a series. (I had him pictured as a little bit craggier, but the actor who plays him is definitely an improvement over my mental picture, and definitely eye candy, and definitely very talented.) What I so love about Bernard Cornwell's series is that his main characters are in and of their times, yet they have problems that are very understandable to us today: For example, King Alfred gives Uhtred a wife; Uhtred is expecting a bad deal, then finds out to his delight that the woman is not a hideous crone. BUT she comes with a debt that can never be repaid, and this doesn't come out until after the marriage is a done deal. Just one example of how King Alfred likes to jack Uhtred around.

7324341,4,B0113FXB9W,"I'll start this by coming clean and admitting that the series of books on which this show is based is my favorite series of books EVER, period. So of course, the chance that the show could live up to the books was miniscule to begin with.

The Good: Fans of the book series have been pining for this show for years, and we got our wish. All TV shows adapted from books are just that- adaptations. It's rare indeed for a book to translate well to the screen or vice-verca without making some changes. This adaptation is, over all, pretty good. People are drawing a lot of comparisons to Vikings and Game of Thrones. It's fair (somewhat) to compare it to the former, and pointless to compare it to the latter. Cornwell's books are solid historical fiction. Vikings is what I'd call 'loose' historical fiction, while Game of Thrones is D&D-like fantasy. The comparison is like apples and oranges, really. It's gritty and it's entertaining, and for the most part the acting is excellent. Being a British production, however, it's playing up the Saxon side of history and Alfred the Great a lot sooner than the books did. The casting choices for Alfred and Leofrich are excellent. The characterization of Uhtred (while abbreviated by how fast they are blowing through his younger life) is very good- in addition to his good traits he's also unapologetic, selfish, grasping, stubborn, and occasionally cruel just like in the book.

The Bad: So far there are 9 books in the series; they are burning through two whole books worth of material in the first 8 episodes. It's too much material to try and pack into 8 episodes and too much is being lost along the way. For folks who aren't familiar with the books the series must seem pretty disjointed. Also, it's painfully evident that the show doesn't have much in the way of a budget. Sadly, this seems to be the case for a lot of BBC productions but they make do pretty nicely. The problem here is that battles which should be 'epic' are anything but, and in at least a couple case they've sort of skipped over major battle entirely and cut straight to the aftermath- which also goes back to the points about going through too much material too quickly.

The Ugly: No disrespect to the lead actor (he's clearly a good one) but Uhtred has been totally and completely miscast. So much so that it's darn near a deal-breaker. Uhtred (as described by Cornwell) is a bear of a man, towering almost a full head over the majority of his peers, tow-haired and easily able to pass for a dane- a veritable Lord of War. They needed someone who looks like a meaner, younger Dolph Lundgren or Vladimir Kulich for the role.

I'd like to see the show continue but my expectations for this production were a lot higher. If it's cancelled I won't be too bothered. No offense to BBC, but I think another network willing to throw a bigger budget at this adaptation might have done a better job of it. In fact, back when the History Channel put out the first season of Vikings I was a little perturbed that they didn't adapt Cornwell's books as their source material; it seemed like a match made in Valhalla. Oh well- wyrd bid ful araed!",1448755200,2,3158,4.564373897707231

7324354,4,B0113FXB9W,"As a diehard fan of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories series, I was overjoyed when I heard the series would be adapted for television, and even more so when I heard the studio responsible for Downton Abbey would be handling it, as they are known for their high production values.

First, Alexander Dreymon has been brilliantly casted as Uhtred.  I was skeptical, but I've come to be convinced that he has the acting chops needed for a character as complicated as this.  He does horrible things (not as horrible as in the book--yet, at least) and you still can't help but like and sympathize with him.  I'm a little concerned about how they're going to age Uhtred as in the books; Dreymon has a very youthful look, but as the series goes on, you can see the added scars, etc., so I think they'll be able to adapt his look.

Other casting has been just as spot-on: Alfred, Leofric, Mildrith, and even Odda the Younger, who is surprisingly complex.  All of these actors have truly delivered, and this is where the series excels.  Unfortunately, Steapa has been replaced by Leofric, but hopefully that was just for this first season.

On to the dislikes: Generally, this adaptation is a bit too ""clean.""  At times, the aesthetics and cinematography can seem soap opera-like.  It's a bit weird, going back and forth between epic, rugged shots and sets that seem a little on the cheap side.  The battles have really been lacking--this is where the low budget of the production becomes apparent, as the epic battles of the books are here filmed in such tight frames or with so few people that it's obvious the director was trying to cover up the fact that it's just 10-20 men in front of the camera.  This is one of my biggest disappointments so far.  The battle with Ubba at Cynuit was a particular let-down, having been scaled down significantly from the riveting climax of the first book.  I was left scratching my head when it was over.

One of my biggest complaints, which I'll admit isn't really a big deal, is with the costumes.  Uhtred has worn the exact same thing since episode 1, with few exceptions.  Not once has he worn mail, which is almost hard to believe, given how often he refers to that attire of his in the books.  His furry Ragnar coat is getting old, but it looks just as fresh as day one.

The last major qualm I have is with the battles, or lack thereof.  The History Channel's Vikings series has done a far, far better job of translating one of Bernard Cornwell's shield walls to the small screen than this series has in its first season.  Those are the grittiest parts of Uhtred's story, and thus far, they have been nearly nonexistent, and far too sanitized when they have appeared.  George R. R. Martin has said that Cornwell writes the best battle scenes of any author he's ever read, and this series is just not delivering enough of that, or with the intensity needed to match the feeling conjured by the books.

All that being said, it's still a very good series, and highly recommended.  Anyone who is a fan of a book series will always be nit-picky about a television or film adaptation, and I admit that I'm still very much enjoying this series for what it is, understanding that not everything can or will be translated faithfully.

One last pitch: If you have enjoyed this series even slightly, don't just read the books, but pick up the audio book version as read by Jonathan Keeble.  He is one of the greatest vocal performers I have ever had the privilege to hear, and he brings this series to life in an amazing way, even far better than this very good television adaptation.

I am not bothered by Uhtred being dark haired at all.  I love the great battle scenes, costumes and backdrops. The acting is fine. I especially loved the look on the elder Uhtred's as he walks into battle. I lost interest in Vikings. I watched this, 7 episodes straight through.

7324359,2,B0113FXB9W,"Such poor casting of Uhtred as to be virtually unwatchable by anyone familiar with the novels.

Now if you are like me and a huge fan of the books you may be a bit disappointed. One of Cornwell's strongest traits is his character development and that was lacking in the show. Uhtred's childhood is completely skipped and that is what creates the man that he is to become. Characters are missing from the show, the timeline is off, important scenes are missed. It is your standard show based off of a book, but with a season to do what had to be done they decided to skip very important events.",1448150400,6,720,4.142857142857143

The quality of the acting, the sets/scenery are first rate, and they tell the most intriguing story of Uhtred as he goes from being a Saxon to a Dane to a man of mixed loyalties in an age of Viking invasion and the fierce resistance by the Saxons of Southern 'England.'

7324369,3,B0113FXB9W,"I will not summarize the plot of THE LAST KINGDOM, as it follows a familiar quest-pattern and has been amply described by previous reviewers. Suffice to say that the source-text's author is Bernard Cornwell, an established writer of historical adventures set in various historical periods that have translated successfully to television in the past (remember SHARPE (1993-2008))?

Directed by four different people (Anthony Byrne, Ben Chanan, Peter Hoar and Nick Murphy), THE LAST KINGDOM is basically SHARPE transposed to the Saxon/ Viking era, with the same combination of familial politics, intrigue and rivalry. The moral priorities are determined from the first episode onwards: the Sharpe-character is personified by Uhtred of Babbanberg (Alexander Dreymon) who must negotiate several obstacles before he can assume his rightful place in the formation of a new kingdom. Good guys and bad guys are easily distinguished, chiefly by their hirsuteness; the bad guys have bushier beards and longer hair than their rivals.

Each episode has its fair share of incident, romance, and a touch of pathos; the visual style owes a lot to Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (2005), with its lengthy pans of lonely isolated, almost primeval landscapes contrasted with dimly-lit interiors illuminated by candlelight. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the elements - sunrises, sunsets, storms, wind and rain - making us aware of how difficult life can be for those trying to establish social and political order. Hence their acts of heroism become all the more noteworthy.

THE LAST KINGDOM might be hokum, but it is nonetheless highly entertaining: we care for the characters and their futures, even if we are well aware of what will happen in the end. As with most adventure novels, there is little doubt that it will have a morally definite ending.",1447977600,,1846,5.272108843537415

The characters are well developed and the gore and sex is appropriate for the times, indeed probably much less prevalent than actual life.  There is no gratuitous blood and gore such as you see in Spartacus or Rome.

While I like the lead actor who plays Uhtred, he looks like he stepped off the film stage of Game of Thrones wearing one of those Night Watch uniforms (the feathery garment that looks like someone slaughtered Big Bird and dyed him black).  The rest of the world looks dirty and somewhat ragged, while he apparently walks through the series so far with a force field around him.  Cornwell paints him much more squalidly: he's basically a randy thug who develops with wisdom only with time.

They have difficulty in finding really attractive ancient British women, or ones with pleasing personalities and still able to connote warrior. But, a lot of the plot lines, and history, religious aspects, are sort of accurate and I like the way it moves form one city to another, as cities in Britain DO have a basis in their history, though people often forget today.

There is lots of meaningless dialogue, and the characterizations are cartoonish and poorly cast. Cornell's Sharpe series was very well done.

They are two completely different types of shows.  One is fantasy, and one deals with history. The screen writers have more leeway with Game of Thrones.  The other one - not as much due to sticking mostly to some historic value.

I will wait for season 2 to see if I can get into this.  If not, too bad.  It has the potential to be great.  But so far...it hasn't grabbed me and I LOVE these types of shows and eat them for Breakfast lunch and dinner.  But then, that may be why I expect more :)

7324420,3,B0113FXB9W,"I have just watched the first two episodes.  I love the books because of the interesting clash of cultures and attitudes that they portray.  So far, the shows fail to interpret the books on that level.  They don't show the reasons for Uhtred's heartfelt adoption of the Danish way of life, or the good-fellowship, easygoing, boisterousness that he treasures.  They don't contrast that pagan joyousness with the mean-hearted fearful subservience that early Saxon Christianity represents to him. They also play fast and loose with the plot, reducing pivot points to clichs instead of giving you the original story.  For example, it hangs Ragnar's favor on Uhtred's defense of his daughter--which is in the book, but that's not the hinge... instead, it should have shown how Ragnar always delighted in Uhtred's daring nature.
As for the backgrounds, they look too clean and airy to be realistic:  No smoke inside the buildings, no stains on the clothing, no mice scurrying in the thatch...
That said, the characterizations are very good and the acting tops.  Uhtred's pride and delight in his prowess is really well portrayed as is Brida's sharpness (although not her wildness), Beocca's benevolence and Alfred's intelligence, drive, and enforced athetiscism.",1446508800,3,1256,5.25

7324422,3,B0113FXB9W,"I thought I'd join the talk about The Last Kingdom. I've been an amateur student of the Viking age for decades; the seed was planted the first time I saw ""The Vikings"" at age 8. I've read many books, and seen museum exhibits here and in Europe, so I have some idea about historical accuracy. I think we all know that when we read novels like Cornwell's, or see these films, we're not getting good history but fractured history and a large dose of artistic license. That being said, any enthusiast wants a reasonable amount of historical plausibility  (""The Long Ships"" ? Please!)  along with the enjoyment. I read the first 3 of Cornwell's stories and lost interest - I found them a bit too much. I'm enjoying the films (saw the first 4 episodes) even thought it's a somewhat flawed production. I'm okay with it not being faithful to the books; it's a filmmaker's artistic license doing a take on a novelist's artistic license, so it's fiction twice removed. (I'm not OK with history being changed, like the upcoming movie on the 1820 Essex whaling  ship tragedy where they put Herman Melville aboard!)  Anyhow, nobody's made a perfect Viking movie yet. Despite some anachronisms, bad dialogue here and there, comic book plot, miscasting (Tony Curtis?) ""The Vikings"" to me is still the best. I've seen History Channel's ""Vikings"" entire series twice so far; not perfect (ships way too small for one thing), but well done, a good blend of twisted myth and history; the acting and characters are to me first rate, the settings and equipment top notch. The Icelandic filmmaker Baltasar Kormakur is planning a Viking movie, and I have hopes he'll make the best yet  (I am thankful that Mel Gibson is not going ahead with his project). So, back to the topic: I think The Last Kingdom films are worth the watch. Good acting, decent sets and costumes/equipment, ( except for Guthrum's - Michael York looked better and seemed more the character in ""Alfred the Great""); I look forward every Sunday for the next episode. The biggest problem to me so far is the bad story-telling of the screenplay in episode one, and a lot of the dialogue throughout is hard to get because of accents,I guess. Give it a go, it's worth 2 bucks a shot.",1446422400,16,2223,4.675191815856778

My yardstick for Viking type movies is the Viking Series from the History Channel. However, this one just didn't make the grade. The young boy who was the son of the nobleman killed, was captured and made a slave, but soon became part of the head Viking's household. These Vikings came from Denmark. Then the story turned into a series of revenge killings - what goes around comes around. These revenge scenarios continued to episode 2 (yes, I watched it) waiting for something momentous to keep my attention. I didn't bother finishing episode 2 and I don't care about episode 3.",1446336000,,741,4.621212121212121

7324427,3,B0113FXB9W,"This keeps reminding me of Vikings.  But that's not such a bad thing.  I mean, if we can have a whole genre called Westerns, then why not one called Vikings?  Like Westerns, Vikings need authentic feel and plenty of action.  Unfortunately, action is expensive, so there's lots of talk here.  I'm sure that Danes and Saxons were men of few words, far fewer than what we get here.

There are a few annoying hangups:  They have the lead, Alexander Dreymon, tending to grin like a Travis Fimmel wannabe, as if to signify that Vikings did their murder, rape and pillage gleefully.  There's yet another of those ""girl-wailing"" soundtracks that have become pretentious clichs.  When Alfred asks Uhtred to tell him something about Viking warfare Uhtred tells him, ""They hate to lose men.""  Really?  I thought the Viking's highest ambition was to die in battle.  Finally, does the hero have to wear a man bun?

Still, this an enjoyable yarn.  The Brits are good at historical stuff, if not very creative, though I guess it's pretty creative to portray Alfred not so much The Great as The Weasel.",1446336000,2,1086,4.737967914438503

I worried that I would be massively disappointed by some slaughtering of the story. Fortunately, my worries were for nothing! I am highly impressed with how it's playing out so far! I keep hearing this show being compared to GOT and how some are under the mistaken or misguided impression that this should live up to GOT expectations. This is not GOT, this is not fantasy and should not be compared as such. This show is historical fiction/drama but by no means should it be considered and some sort of fantasy genre. Nor is it all about graphic sex for ratings. This is a dirty, grim, and often harsh look at history and life during the time of Alfred's reign and the Great Heathen armies conquest of England. I have read some reviews in which the viewers complained that it felt dated and low budget as compared to some other shows. I completely disagree in that regard. As I mentioned, what it is, is a more realistic presentation showing the conditions that many- most people lived in during that time.

Are there some historical inaccuracies, of course there are- nothing is perfect and I don't expect 100% historical authenticity or accuracy... if I did, I would refrain from television or fiction at all and read only text books about the events- and even then, I would never get exact because even text books make mistakes. I am far more interested in the story that is being told here and that story is keeping me interested and waiting for each new episode. If you have read the books, yes there are deviations and changes so I suppose that if you are book purist, this may cause you some frustration, annoyance or irritation. I appreciate the changes that have been made to make this story work in the compacted visual version that the creators are limited to. As far as I can see, the story is still falling into place and following a similar path as the books did, just getting there in a slightly different manner.",1445731200,,2163,4.589147286821706

First, where are the dogs? Your Pekinese goes ballistic when the hated mailman is still a block away, don't you think that Earl Ragnar's dogs would have been barking their brains out before a raiding party could get within two miles of his great hall? What's the point of feeding the mangy mutts if they don't warn you until the intruders are throwing torches on your roof?

Second, the English were great archers (ask the French). Yet twice someone rode right up to the gates of Bebbanburg to gift them a head and neither time did he get an arrow in the gizzard for his impertinence.

7324496,4,B0113FXB9W,"Always love the mix of fiction and historical fact that Bernard Cornwell brings to his work and I appreciate his honesty when he writes about where he has used conjecture to provide drama or fill in gaps about what may have happened in the absence of a clear historical fact. The BBC makes excellent drama and this production can stand alone as a well produced and well crafted work of television but I think they could have taken a leaf out of Mr. Cornwell's book and provided a similar explanation of the historical accuracy and context. I wish they had also paid more attention to the descriptions of the characters. Viewers who have not read the books will not, of course care about this oversight but I'm guessing that the core of viewers will be avid fans and would have preferred that Bernard Cornwell had a greater input than it appears he has had. That said, I am thoroughly enjoying the series and would love to see the BBC produce more of his work together with the adaptations of authors such as C.J.Sansom and Alison Weir or Amanda Scott's 'Boudica'.",1445472000,,1063,4.6

I swear its like they didn't even have a historical consultant on hand, nothing was right... from the lack luster battle scenes, to the cheap and obviously plastic helmets, the square shields for the Saxons... I could go on and on...  sigh.

The story, ugh.. it has been butchered to such an extent that is really is only slightly recognizable... stripping out all of Uhtrud's childhood and background was a mistake that I really don't see how they will recover from for the rest of the series.

I've been looking forward to this show for awhile, being very disappointed by Bastard Executioner, as a big fan of both Vikings and GOT.  This first episode is a lot of set up, and I laughed when the plot lined up exactly with the Lion King more than once, but I love the setting of early Medieval England and it's done very well.  I haven't read the books, and have no idea what further episodes have in store, but I will say the one thing that worries me so far is the show's treatment of its female characters.  There's a bunch of groping and not much dialogue for them unfortunately.  Where are my viking warrior women?  Have to say, people put down GOT but it's still winning in that area so far.

7324533,5,B0113FXB9W,"I made an impulse purchase of the entire season of this show based on the trailer, my love of the time period and my fondness for BBC America. I'll preface this by saying that I haven't read any of the historical fiction books in the Saxon Tales series by Bernard Cornwell, so this is a layman's opinion of episode 1.

The Last Kingdom tells the tale of young Uhtred of Bebbanburg, heir to a Saxon kingdom, and his attempt to reclaim his title after the violent death of pretty much everyone he cares about in episode 1. This is visceral and primal fare for BBC America but it never approaches the hedonistic depths that A Game of Thrones descends into for HBO. Expect some coarse language with a few adult themes, and if dropping prisoners from a 25 ft ceiling to the floor is deemed inappropriate in your home for some reason, then you might want to put the kids to bed early.

I enjoyed the gritty look of the sets and characters, and the fact that the viking ships were actually made of wood and not from bits and bytes at Weta Workshop or ILM was greatly appreciated. Well done. The costumes, makeup and sets are all well crafted for a BBC production competing against the bloated budgets of their online studio competitors.

I confess that I watch too much BBC, but as a yank who has visited the UK numerous times, I've become pretty good at understanding different British dialects. However, sometimes when the action is too loud, or the actors don't enunciate, or the actors whisper and mumble while the action is too loud... well, I can't understand a damn thing. That's why I used closed captioning for some parts of episode 1. It's a bit distracting, but the Fire TV let's you pick a small point size which isn't too obtrusive, and makes some scenes much more comprehensible. For instance, in one scene without CC my wife asked me ""What did he just say?"" to which I replied ""Oh, I think Ravenger just told Ootrip don't ever fry wheat with Bubba."" For some reason this didn't make sense to my wife, so we turned on CC to discover that Ravn told Uhtred never to fight with Ubba. It's a subtle translation difference, but if you simply must follow along with the plot, CC can come in handy.

Thankfully, there are still plenty of interesting characters for the show to kill off, including a murdering power mad uncle, Uhtred's, um, common law wife, the perpetually groped and abused Thyra, and finally Sven the cyclops... who appears to be impersonating Kirk Douglas's character Einar from the 1958 movie The Vikings, but not because Tony Curtis released his eye gouging hawk... oops, I digress. You'll have to watch for yourself.

This promises to be an epic adventure with solid performances and a gripping script brimming with characters you'll care about.

7324534,5,B0113FXB9W,"Authentic settings and props, stays very close to the book.

7324536,1,B0113FXB9W,"I am a HUGE fan of the Saxon Chronicles, so much so that I've read books 1-5 at least half a dozen times, and the more recent books at least 2 times each. I'll start with minor complaints about the TV show, like Uhtred is short and a brunette, and Ragnar is a brunette as well. Beocca is cast as a middle-aged priest, and has none of the physical attributes or personality traits of the character in the books. We all have images in our heads of our favorite literary characters, and the cast of the BBC Last Kingdom look nothing like the characters as they're described in Cornwell's books. Maybe these are silly details to get caught up on, but they're hard to ignore. And then there are my more serious complaints...major plot details are changed, perhaps to propel the story faster, but the changes are hardly justifiable. I won't give away any spoilers, out of respect for those of you who haven't watched it yet. Maybe if I didn't have such a love affair with the Saxon Chronicles, I would have enjoyed the show more than I did, so I don't mean to deter new fans. But for those of you who have loved Uhtred for years, and were eagerly awaiting the show, lower your expectations so that maybe your disappointment will not be so keen. It's been a struggle to sit through the entirety of episode 1, and I regret buying the season pass. I'll stick with the books and won't subject myself to this show again.",1444521600,8,1409,4.423076923076923

7324538,4,B0113FXB9W,"Engaging series set in a turbulent time.. The ninth century is a violent but formative period for England. Northeastern England was conquered by the Danes. To this day it has a Scandinavian character in ancestry, accents, and heritage. The word York comes from Old Norse Jrvk. The dragon ships had a shallow draft enabling them to sail up rivers. The Vikings were hungry for land as well as plunder. In the titular last kingdom, a leader arises, Alfred the Great who fights the great Viking army to a standstill after a long hard period of loosing and guerrilla fighting. The Danes and the Saxons do eventually merge as a people enriching the English language with pronouns and s endings for plurals and many words, including husband. By the way, the Danes brought orange tabby cats with them.

Some gruesome scenes including lopped off heads, torture, and intimidation not suitable for young children, but mild compared to some recent shows.",1444521600,,942,4.9245283018867925
7324539,5,B0113FXB9W,"I've noticed that there's been a lot of Medieval/Vikings shows lately. Vikings, The Bastard Executioner, and The Last Kingdom are just a few examples of the ones I've watched. This first episode really convinced me that this show will be worth watching. The story telling and development was alright for the most part, if anything it might've  paced along too fast for me. To lose 2 important historical characters like that straight out the gate really left me a little concerned for the story-line later on. I don't think that this show will follow the historical timelines to a T, but it will have some relevant moments.

Last Kingdom takes place in 9th century England during a time of conflict between the Danish Vikings and England. The first episode really sets up the background story for the main character that we will be following along with. They skipped through large periods of his life from when he was a little boy to early adulthood to show you his beginnings. I thought this show was going to focus mainly on Ragnar Lothbrok because of the timeline and Vikings invasion, but I was wrong. I think it is better that they went with this route because Vikings already have their foothold in that area. At this point in development, they can do whatever they want with the storyline and I think that's a good thing. Can't wait to see what they bring in the future.

Edit: Sorry, didn't know that this was based off a book. I've finished episode 5 now and the story has just been getting increasingly better. Definitely a must watch if you're into the Viking series. They depict both side's culture and religion really well.",1444521600,23,1636,4.693379790940766
