13: Game of Death /or 13 Beloved- This Thai film is extremely suspenceful. A guy down on his luck is offered 100 million if he completes 13 challenges for an underground game show. If he quits, fails, or is found by the police in one of the challenges, the game is over and all money he has one will be dropped. And each act is becoming more degrading and the police is on his trail... Krissada Sukosol Clapp does a great job as the main character: When your not worried about him commiting an act that brings the tension but more what will be next or if he'll finish of his last task. Some parts had me talking at the screen and I got so mad at one character near the end that I wanted him to die, something I rarely ever do in a movie. Plus it's a great mixture of comedy and suspence that is easier to access for people not into horror. This is in fact almost nothing like the cover would have you believe. Plus it has some big things to say about Thai culture, and while not everything it throws works, it felt rewarding for me and with that I give it honor. The best movie on the collection, this one deserves 6/10.

Automation Transfusion- As much great special effects and zombie cliches' [Ashley Elizabeth Pierce is great screamer] this low-budget movie had, it wasn't that great. The characters are mostly done with steriotypical bad acting [Except for William Howard Bowman, Kevin J. O'Neill, Larry Miller], the camera work is bad and the ending is Tarantino garbage. But still, this can be fun at times with it's earnest. I give it a 4/10.

Black Sheep- Despite heavy raving over this When-Sheep-Attack movie being New Zealand's best gore outing since the heyday of Peter Jackson, I didn't see it. It's not bad and the gore and sheep-people [You heard me] by the Weta Workshop is impressive but the characters, despite the okay acting of Tandi Wright, Oliver Driver, Nick Blake, Tammy Davis and Glenis Levestam [Or the pretty Danielle Mason], it feels dull with coloring. Good photography though.

Broken- Ugghj. I haven't seen this all the way. I like low budget. I like torture. I don't know what it was about this one but after the opening credits I turned it off. If you truly want to buy this, buy it on the special package slip cover which open up like a slit body.

Rogue- Your average People-get-stuck- with-Alligator-when-boat-goes-down film. Ohh, look. There's your uptight girl, there's the mean boyfriend, there's John Wayne. It's just stock characters. It does wager some suspenceful moments in it's second half and the characters build their own personalities but this is just too average. If you are to watch this for something, make it because our hero has to carry a dirty, scratched up, knocked out Radha Mitchell through a cave. He has to battle the alligator and she sill never wakes up through the whole fight. Totally titillating.

Welecome TO The Jungle- I didn't watch much of this one. I don't care much for Shaky cam movies, especially ones just using it for budget. I geuss this one is like Cannibal Holocaust about kids going to look for Nelson Rockefeller and meet cannibals. I liked the two ladies [Sandy Gardiner and Veronica Sywak] but stopped after the talking.

Overall, this is an okay set for people wanting more movies in their collection, especially the Dimension extreme label or gory titles. But most of the movies are just mediocre.

Price: I'd say you should pay ten doallers at absolute most. It's hard to buy a collection when one title is scratched. But make sure that scratched title isn't 13: Game of Death. I'd say just try to buy it on the go or on a whim. Maybe 6 doallers new.",1369180800,4,3890,4.531339031339031
