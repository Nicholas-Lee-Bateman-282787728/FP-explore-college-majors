8738120,4,B0176HOUYG,"First, I really like Nathan Carter, consider him one of my favorite singers, and I've purchased several of his CD's and 2 of his DVD's, including this one.  I purchased this DVD and the CD format specifically for ""Home to Donegal."" BUT--at his concerts he should do the singing and let the audience do the listening. It has become tedious hearing his constant ""hands in the air"" and letting the audience do the singing. We purchase his CD's and DVD's to hear him sing, not the audience. Also, his asking the audience to rub the leg of the person next to him/her was amusing in the ""Wagon Wheel Live Show"" but when he repeated it on this DVD, it was stale. Nathan is a gifted entertainer, but it's good that he's not aiming for the American market because American audiences are fickle and would quickly grow weary of his repetitive shows and constant ""hands in the air.""",1455148800,,870,4.54140127388535
8738121,5,B0176HOUYG,Nathan has a great voice.  Bought the digital version of this performance when I heard his remake of Dolly Parton's Two Doors Down.  Got the whole house stomping to that one!  He sings the notes cleanly unlike many of his peers that do god-awful vocal acrobatics and kill everything song they sing both old and new.  Wish him all the best.  Can't wait until we get the DVD!,1447459200,,373,4.426470588235294
