1828055,5,B000087F5G,"2 out of 3 Falls Match
1st Fall-Street Fight
2nd Fall-Steel Cage Match
3rd Fall-Ladder Match
World Heavyweight Championship:
Shawn Michaels(c) vs. Triple H w/ Ric Flair
*****
-The best match of the year! This match was so brutal, it outdid the Elimination Chamber Match and their match at Summerslam. HBK and Triple H damn near killed eachother, there was blood everywhere. Steel chairs, Flaming Barbwire Bats, Tables, Ladders, you name it. Both men gave forth a tremendous effort, Shawn Michaels was the ""Heartbreak Kid"" of old but when the final bell ringed, it was ""The Game's"" hand raised in victory as the new World Heavyweight Champion.
WWE Championship:
Big Show(c) w/ Paul Heyman vs. Kurt Angle
****
-Without a doubt, the Big Show's best match of his career. It just goes to show how amazing Kurt Angle really is, being able to have such an incredible match with about anybody on the roster. Brock Lesnar made a run-in all hell broke loose in this match! Kurt Angle picked up the victory after a devestating F-5 and became the new WWE Champion.
Fatal Four Way Match for the World Tag Team Championship:
Christian & Chris Jericho(c) vs. Booker T & Goldust vs.
The Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm & William Regal
****
-The best part about this match was the last 5 minutes, it should have just been Jericho and Christian against Goldust and Booker T because they have had so many great tag team matches on RAW and really made the Tag Team Titles mean something. There were plenty of false finishes and great technical wrestling from all four teams.
Triple Threat Match for the Women's Championship
Victoria(c) vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline
***1/2
-A decent match. Didn't do as well as the Hardcore Match at Survivor Series but defenitley a very good match. All three competitors put you on the edge of your seat with some good spots and false finishes.
Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero
****1/2
-This one had ""classic"" written all over it and surely did deliver. Great match physcology used here, a well wrestled technical match with plenty of submissions and great offense with lots of exciting near falls. Almost as good as the main-event.
A-Train vs. Edge
****
-Suprisingly, a great match. Edge and A-Train mixed well with their styles, the high flying charismatic Edge against the rough and tough A-Train. Both used tremendous offense and counters and delivered one hell of a match.
Kane vs. Batista w/ Ric Flair
****
-Another great match, plenty of power displayed by Kane and Batista. Flair's interference caused Kane the match though, after Batista delivered an amazing sit-out Powerbomb to Kane.
-Lesbian Scene-
Hot! Torrie and Dawn made good on the hype. A lot better than HLA.
Bottom Line: This is the best PPV of 2002, no doubt. I strongly suggest this DVD.",1042848000,5,2771,4.823529411764706
1828056,3,B000087F5G,"WWE Armageddon 2002 was the final P.P.V. of the year.  Headlining the card was a two out of three falls match for the World Heavyweight Championship.  The first fall was a street fight.  The second fall was a cage match.  The third and deciding fall was a ladder match.  In that match-up, Shawn Michaels does battle one more time with former champ, Triple H.  For the WWE Title, Big Show defends against Kurt Angle.  Where will Brock Lesnar stand?  In a 4-corners elimination match, Chris Jericho and Christian defend the World Tag Team Titles against Booker T and Goldust, the Dudley Boyz and Lance Storm & William Regal.  In a match of the year candidate, Chris Benoit goes one on one with Eddie Guerrero.  Edge takes on A-Train.  Victoria defends the Women's Title against Trish Stratus and Jacqueline in a triple threat match.  Kane tries to fight off the challenge of Batista.  In an extra added segment that was really just a waste of time, Dawn Marie tries to expose Torrie Wilson as a sexual predator right in front of her father.  Overall there is some good solid wrestling action on this DVD.  However even though there were only a few weak spots, it seemed to slow down the event just enough to keep it from being one of the best of the year.",1042416000,,1253,4.53125

Match 1

World Tag Team Titles - Fatal Fourway

Chris Jericho and Christian(c, i call them Y2C) vs Lance Storm and William Regal vs Dudley Boyz vs Booker T and Goldust!

This match made every body think the PPV was gonna be great(even though it wasn't) but a great opener and the winners of this match deserved the titles! 7.5/10

Match 2

Edge vs A-train

Short match but had some good highspots, but the end turned the whole damn match around when it ended in DQ! 6/10

Match 3

Eddie Gurrero(tag team champion) vs Chris Benoit

Easily the match of the night and there weren't any titles on the line and if you liked this you should watch there match at Vengeance 2003! 8.8/10

Match 4

Kane vs Batista(w/ ric flair)

This is where everything changes this match was a squash but had some good moves good win for batista! 5.5/10

Triple H(w/ ric flair) vs Shawn Michaels(C)

This was something like the second 2 out of 3 falls stipulation match and was a main event outcome: pathetic! First fall was a bit too long but was really good like there match at Summerslam!

Second fall had crashing tables and that was it, that was cool but it was much of a match HBK kicked HHH ass easily! Third fall wasn't much and this match could have saved this event! 7.9/10

It should also be noted that any sports-entertainment segment which I deem to take up enough time to warrant inclusion in the review, will also be rated. As a general rule, these segments will have to last at least 7 minutes.

BOOKERT/GOLDUST defeated CHRIS JERICHO/CHRISTIAN, LANCE STORM/WILLIAM REGAL & THE DUDLEY BOYZ in an Elimination Match to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: The first 6 minutes of this opener was disappointingly terrible. But following the practically simultaneous elimination of The Dudleyz & Storm/Regal, the remaining 2 teams showed why this bout should have been a normal tag match. The remaining 10 minutes was a hot & predominantly crisp bout, with excellent exchanges right up until the crowd-pleasing finale. Match Rating...7

EDGE defeated A-TRAIN: I thought that this bout should have been a 'No Holds Barred' Match, in order to gain some sort of interest for this lifeless feud. Even at 7 minutes, this match went on too long. It ended with Albert using a chair to disqualify himself. Not as horrible as it could have been, but not that pretty either. Match Rating...5

CHRIS BENOIT defeated EDDIE GUERRERO: A technical masterpiece, this bout showed why these 2 superstars are recognized as 2 of the best mat technicians ever. A match that highlighted the great intensity of both combatants, I'm going to be ultra critical & state that there wasn't enough fast-paced high-flying action thrown into this 17 minute match. Guerrero finally tapped to a crossface that Benoit applied from the opposite side than usual. Match Rating...8

DAWN-MARIE, AL & TORRIE WILSON Segment: A segment has to be really good to be given over 15 minutes on a pay-per-view. This wasn't!!! Sure, some teenage males may have got something out of it, but even that could have been done in less time. I wonder how many parents would have been put off by this segment...??? The one thing the segment did succeed in doing, was heating up the crowd. That can't be denied, but almost one tenth of the whole event was spent on this. Segment Rating...3

BATISTA defeated KANE: Folks, this was a painful 7 minutes to watch. This match was just plain horrible at times. Everything seemed wrong, even the timing of Flair's interference. I've been saying it for months; As good as Batista's potential is, he clearly is not ready for a singles push yet. Match Rating...4

VICTORIA defeated TRISH STRATUS & JACQUELINE to Retain the Womens Title: This triple-threat match was extremely fast-paced early on & I was wondering how long the 3 combatants could keep it up for. Then I realized why it was so frenetic. When you're only given 4 minutes or so to work with, you have to go that fast. The entire ppv did run over time & I got the feeling that this was the match that suffered the consequences. I actually didn't mind the match until the ridiculous finish that saw Victoria pin Jackie following a belt shot to the head. Why wouldn't they let Victoria use that devastating finisher of hers? Match Rating...6

KURT ANGLE defeated THE BIG SHOW to win the WWE Championship: Major props to Kurt Angle in this match. To show the intensity & enthusiasm that he did to get such a good 13 minute match out of The Big Show, is exactly why the WWE needs Kurt to be the face of the WWE in 2003. Genuinely well put together match with a crowd-pleasing ending. Match Rating...7

TRIPLE H defeated SHAWN MICHAELS 2 Falls To 1, to win the World Heavyweight Title: Hard to rate, this match seemed to lack the freshness of the duo's SummerSlam bout, nor equal the brilliance of Triple H's '2 out of 3 falls' match against Steve Austin at No Way Out 2001. But comparing this match to 2 matches I rated a perfect 10, is definitely a compliment. The effort these 2 put into the 22 minute streetfight, 10 minute cage match & 8 minute ladder match cannot be questioned. Far from perfect, the sum total of 40 minutes was nonetheless entertaining, and at the end of the day, being entertained is why we as fans watch professional wrestling. Match Rating...8

PPV RATING (48/80) = 60

Looking at the key, I have basically given Armageddon a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. It only just got into that rating range, yet I'm still happy with that overall grade & comment. It was an up-and-down pay-per-view event.",1114732800,,4787,4.685339690107271

Good segment.  Flair took a good beating in this match.  Crazy spot when HBK jumps off the top of the cage and onto Triple H, through a table.  (9/10)

3rd Fall/Ladder Match

Another good segment, but slow.  Michaels takes a nasty bump falling off the ladder and through four tables.  Good match, just a bit short.  (9/10)

Overall, this match was good.  It suffered because Triple H was hurt and really couldn't do much.  Overall match rating:  (9/10)

This DVD is not really worth picking up.  The main event sounds better than it actually was.  One worthwhile thing about this DVD is the extra match which featured a Fatal Fourway Elimination #1 Contender Match on Smackdown which featured Kurt Angle, Edge, Chris Benoit, and Eddie Guerrero.  Great match, with many, many close falls.  (9/10)

1828078,4,B000087F5G,"When I saw this ppv I have to say I was hesitant to oder it. The only match I was really looking forward too was the Main Event. However once I saw this in its entirety I realized I did not waste my money. The extras on the DVD are okay, but could have been better, but several matches on the wrestling card made up for it.

Fatal Four Way match for Raw tag team championships: This was good for an opener. The crowd was excellent since they were way in the corners of Booker T and Goldust or the Dudley Boyz. I was surprised to see the Dudleyz eliminated so soon, but at least Booker T and Goldust won. A good match. 8/10

Edge vs. A-Train: This was a sort of dissapointment since Edge used a chair to get DQ. This is where Albert would formally become A-Trian, don't know why he changed it to that but anything is better than Albert for him I guess. Slow match. 7/10

Kane vs. Batista: This was strength and power vs, strength and power. I can still not see Batista as strong as Kane, but somehow he keeps knocking him down. Flair makes his prescence known and causes Kane to lose. This was a good match, but only for RAW. 7.5/10

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero: A good match but slow in some spots. Benoit gets payback from Eddie after Eddie cost Benoit the title shot. The match was very back and forth and Benoit finally gets the win after making Eddie tap out to the crossface. A great match. 8/10

Triple Threat Womens Match: Not very good, this was just a card filler in my opinion. Victoria wins. 6/10

WWE Championship Match: This was good and suspenseful. When A-Train came out again and ran over Angle the entire crowd went into a confused state. Then Brock Lesnar comes out and ruins the match, not that I am a Big Show fan, its just Angle should have done the angle slam after the interference. The ending looked like Angle won just because of Brock. Still a good match between these two. 9/10

Two out of Three falls match: Match of the night. The videotape at the beginning of the match is really awsome. HHH and Shawn's entrances are awsome in this one. Out of all three matches the best would be the cage match. Garbage cans, chairs, and even a table was used when shawn jumped off the top of the cage onto HHH through a table. The street fight was kinda slow but it does have Shawn hitting HHH in the face with a BURNING barbed wire bat. The ladder match also had Shawn falling off the top of a ladder through four tables. This was a great match. 10/10

The extras have 5 interviews and the Fatal Four Way match for the #1 contendership for the Smackdown title. That was a good match and Angle gave an Angle slam to edge off the top rope!
Also, too the guys, the torrie wilson and Dawn Marie footage is off the page also. The crowd and Al Wilson are kind of annoying though.",1093392000,4,2794,4.248587570621469

Raw Tag titles - Jericho & Christian V Booker T & Goldust V Regal & Storm V Dudleys
This was a cool match to start the PPV. At the end Booker & Goldust won, which was great as everyone wanted them to. 7/10
Edge V A-Train
This match was booked because A-Train injured Rey. Edge can do way better than this match, and I've never liked A-Train much. The end is stupid - a DQ. Afterwards Edge beats the hell out of A-Trian with a chair. 6/10
Eddie Guerrero V Chris Benoit
If you like technical matches you'll like this. If not, you'll get bored. The crowd got bored of it and so did I. 4/10
Kane V Batista
This was just a push match for Batista really. It was alright, but there was no chemistry between the two. 5/10
Women's Championship - Trish Stratus V Jacqueline V Victoria
A short bout that was actually not bad for a women's match. Fast paced. 5/10
WWE Title Kurt Angle V The Big Show
This was a quite good match, with  Angle leading Big Show. The end was rather stupid since Angle wins after pinning directly after interference from Brock Lesnar. Angle should have done something else first instead of pinning straight away, because it meant he won as a direct result of Lesnar. Good match though. 7/10
World Heavyweight Championship Two-out-of-Three Falls Match
Triple H V Shawn Michaels
First Fall - Streetfight
Second Fall - Steel Cage Match
Third Fall - Ladder Match
Best match of the night easily. The first fall is quite long and drags on a bit, but there are some cool spots including Triple H lighting some barbed wire on fire. The second fall is the best one, and should have been longer. They use a table and Ric Flair interferes, but Shawn still manages to win meaning the 3rd fall is necessary. The final fall is the shortest of all, but then end is quite cool as HBK is pushed from on top of a ladder in the ring all the way down to 4 tables on the outside! 9/10
Overall
Armageddon was a pretty good PPV. The main event is a great match, and the mid-card has some decent matches on it too.",1086048000,,2022,4.321052631578947

Four Way Elimination Match for World Tag Team Championship-Chris Jericho and Christian vs Booker T and Goldust vs William Regal and Lance Storm vs The Dudley Boyz-The Dudley Boyz reunited at the Survivor Series and Goldust decided that if he and Booker T did not win the titles then they would break up. A solid and fast paced match that had a good ending. Drags a little, but only when it comes down to two teams. One of the highlights of the ppv. 8 out of 10 stars.
Edge vs A-Train- Can't stand A-Train. Outside of the shortlived X-Factor he has never shown anything to make him worth watching. This was the case with this match. A decent feud that centered around A-Train injuring Rey Mysterio, but a lackluster match. Edge is really misused here as he deserves to be in better feuds than this one. 7 out of 10.
Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit- Two of the greatest technical wrestlers in the WWE lock horns. Not as exciting as what was expected, but a solid technical match. A decent showing from these two and hopefully there will be a rematch later on. Another highlight of the show. 8 out of 10 stars.
Kane vs Batista w/Ric Flair- Batista is an impressive looking wrestler, but he has yet to do anything that really makes him stand out. Kane has been stale since he returned. These two have actually met in the past when Batista was in OVW, but nothing shows here. This is a boring match that had nothing going for it. Please do not put these two together again.  5 out of 10 stars.
Triple Threat for the Women's Championship-Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria- A match that was thankfully kept short. One of the worse women's matches on ppv in a while. 3 out of 10.
Kurt Angle vs The Big Show w/Paul Heyman- Kurt Angle is awesome. He can carry anyone to a decent match and that goes for this one too. A solid match with the only downfall being the interference from Lesnar. A clean ending would have made this match, but it would have hurt the Big Show so the ending makes sense. 9 out of 10.
Triple H vs Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Two-out-of-Three Falls Match: The First Fall a Streetfight, The Second Fall a Steel Cage Match and the Third Fall a Ladder Match- The match of the night. Shawn Michaels is the HBK of old and it shows here. The only downfall is the ending, which was kind of predictable. Other than that a 10 star match.

Only problem was it was a long match and it seemed to bore you a little but once Regal & Storm and the Dudleyz are gone, the match gets better. 7/10
Match 2: Edge vs. A-Train: Looked like another boring Smackdown match but actually turned out to be a fairly good match especially when Edge goes wild on A-Train after the A-Train's gets DQ. 8/10
Match 3: Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guererro: Actually this was the match that actually stole the show. One of my favorites. Great technical moves until Chavo to help his tag partner and uncle Eddie. But Benoit had a good match and proved that everyone is prone to tap to the Crossface. 9/10

This was a long match, 16 or 17 minutes long. A very good match. The first 2 teams were eliminated in about 5 minutes, up until then the action got started quickly and kept going. The final 2 teams were Jericho & Christian and Booker & Goldust. Shortly after 2 teams were eliminated, Goldust got double teamed for a while in the least exciting part of the match, but Goldust tags Booker, and the rest of the match is only Booker T & Jericho. They put on a great show, And Booker & Goldust finally win the tag titles. 9/10
Match 2: Edge vs. A-Train (Albert)
This was a typical big man vs. small man match. It had a reasonable pace, with the occasional interesting move. A-Train does some impressive powerful moves - like the Baldo Bomb, and Edge uses quickness. A good match overall, but it ends in a DQ which is rare for a PPV non-title match. 7.5/10

If you like flawless technical wrestling, then you'll love this. It lasted nearly 17 minutes. The start was basically all technical holds, but it then picked up and became a very good match. 9/10

A short 4-minute match, not bad, but it could've been a lot better. The women's division was quite strong at this time. 7/10
Match 6: WWE Title: Kurt Angle vs. Big Show
It was quite funny to watch Kurt try to over-power the Big Show, In the beginning, Show was beating up Angle, but Kurt fought back, and Brock Lesnar's interference directly leads to Kurt winning the title! Good match 9/10
Match 7: 2 out of 3 falls: World Title: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
Fall 1: Street Fight: This just went far too long, about 20 minutes. Very slow, but exciting in parts.
Fall 2: Cage Match: The pace picks up here and Ric Flair gets involved. This was probably the most exciting fall, 9 minutes long.
Fall 3: Ladder Match: This only lasted 5 minutes, actually, but was still an entertaining match, with a few nasty spots. Overall this match is 9/10

( Match Reviews )
--- Four-Way Elimination Match for the World Tag Team Championship - Chris Jericho and Christian Vs Booker T and Goldust Vs The Dudley Boyz Vs Lance Storm and William Regal ---
This was a good opener that moved quickly and contained some funny moments. Goldust surprised me once again in this match as he not only wrestled well but he played his character of the weak link well to, not to mention Goldust took some bigger than usual bumps. The last two teams put on quite the performance with many near falls and exciting moments, good tag match. (6/10)
--- Edge Vs A-Train ---
This was unexpectedly a pretty good match, better then anything I have seen from A-Train. The match accomplished showing A-Trains strength and contained some high spots. The match ends in DQ, after the match is over there is quite the beating with a chair. Nothing to special but still better then I expected. (5/10)
--- Chris Benoit Vs Eddie Guerrero ---
This was a great match however it was still a disappointment, The pace was much slower then I expected it to be and there was not many of those fast move to counter wrestling sequences to be found. The match was filled mostly with great submissions and submission countering. The crowd at one point started chanting boring and I really have no clue why, I guess Japan type wrestling doesn't work to well in America. The match also contains some technical and high fly wrestling, sadly there is a interference in this match although it really didn't effect the match that much. Most of what these two do is perfected making them two of the best in the world, you should see the powerbomb. Good ending, great match, just not Eddie and Benoit's best encounter. (7.5/10)
--- Kane Vs Batista ---
This match was thankfully pretty short, there is not much to say about it. Batista could not get Kane up for the powerbomb in the middle of the match, however Batista eventually got him up and dropped him hard. This match was bad but it wasn't completely horrible. (3/10)
--- Triple-Threat Women's Championship Match - Victoria Vs Trish Stratus Vs Jacqueline ---
This was one of the better Women's matches I have seen in WWE, all women went full throttle in this short but fast paced match. There where a few moves done that aren't usually done by the women of WWE. Great effort from everyone in this match. (6.5/10)
--- WWE Championship Match - Big Show Vs Kurt Angle ---
I thought this was a very good match, just like the Albert match the Big Shows strength was shown in this. Kurt Angle almost broke his neck while attempting a moonsault off the top rope onto a standing Big Show. Kurt Angle actually flew quite a bit in this match. The end had interference's that I wish where never there but they where kinda necessary for story line purposes. Kurt pulled out one of the Big Show's best matches, Kurt Angle is so impressive he can pull a good match out of anyone. (6.5/10)
--- Best Two-out-of-Three Falls for the World Championship Match - Shawn Michaels Vs Triple H ---
I do not find this match as great as many other seem to, what you are getting in this is three matches in one, you are getting one average street fight, one average cage match and one poor ladder match. The match is just full of screw ups, drags on at points and is slowly paced, I guess that's because of the length of the match. Shawn Michael's just cannot leap off a ladder like he used to and he takes the pedigree worse then almost everyone. There is also a long period of time taken in the street fight and cage match setting up tables and not breaking them. This match however does have its moments, there is quite a bit of weapons and hard hitting action, there is one big move in each fall that are pretty good but at the same time they are things that have already been done before and done better. I easily give the wrestlers credit for taking the pain and putting in the effort that they did in this match, especially because they where both injured however it just didn't live up to what I was expecting. (6/10)
( Extra Feature )
The extras on this DVD fall on the short side, there is 5 exclusive interviews however the wrestlers are still in character and also tired from their match. The DVD also contains a extra and amazing match. It is a Fatal Four-Elimination Match to Determine the No. 1 Contender from Smackdown on December 5, 2002, it is Chris Benoit Vs Kurt Angle Vs Eddie Guerrero Vs Edge, Very good match with close falls and a great finish. Very good match however overall lacking special features. (4/10)
( Overall DVD )
With only one match being lower then 5/10 I can say that pretty much the whole show was entertaining. Again the footage of Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie shows nothing so don't expect anything from that. Keep in mind that I rate women matches differently from the men's, so if you look at my scores and are wondering why I gave the women's match the same as Kurt Angle's match it is because I rate the women easier. No insult to the women's triple-threat however, they really did put on a good match. With good matches of different styles of wrestling I would say that this is a good event to at least rent and possibly buy.",1056758400,,5723,4.472275334608031

William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Booker T and Goldust vs. Jericho & Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz

Edge vs. A-Train
Seeing as how Albert's, ring performance has greatly improved since using the name A-Train, I was thinking that this would be a solid match.

in the business. A great contest. *** stars.

Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline
Decent match. It's what I've come to expect from these three.  Interesting ending. **1/2 stars.
WWE Championship:
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle
Looking at this match on paper, you would think twice about watching it, but actually both superstars performed extremely well. A great finish, which later sets up a rivalry and the current storyline. *** stars.
World Championship-2 out of 3 Falls:
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
The first fall seemed a bit long and it took a while for it to really get going. Very exciting when the match did pick up. ***1/2 stars.
The second fall was more entertaining, yet very short. Not too much high risk, but still a good effort. *** stars.
The third and deciding fall was, in my opinion only about seven minutes and was getting good until it had ended. It definitely left you wanting more. Disappointing in that respect. **3/4 stars. Overall match rating: ***stars.
Good card with very little to show for it. The WWE has really went downhill since then and let's hope that they can find a way to rebound from all these lackluster events.",1048204800,,2530,4.584988962472406
1828098,5,B000087F5G,"THE END IS HERE FOR HBK
The end of Shawn Michaels' World Heavyweight Championship reign came at Armageddon when Triple H defeated HBK in a best two-out-of-three falls match. The Game pinned Michaels in the first match, a Street Fight, after hitting him with a Pedigree.
The second fall, a Steel Cage Match, saw Shawn Michaels give it his all in an attempt to hold on to his World Heavyweight Championship. Despite Ric Flair's interference, Shawn Michaels was able to pin Triple H after leaping from the top of the cage onto The Game, while he lay lifeless on a table.
The third and final fall, a Ladder Match, decided the winner. After sending Shawn Michaels off the top of the ladder into four tables, Triple H climbed the ladder to win the match and capture the World Heavyweight Championship.
In a match that had to be seen to be believed, Kurt Angle defeated Big Show to capture the WWE Championship. The victory came after Brock Lesnar gave Big Show the F5 while the official was knocked out. Prior to Brock's interference, the match was back and forth. On numerous occasions, either competitor could have walked away with the victory. It especially looked as though Show was going to pin Angle after the A-Train interfered on Show's expense. It wasn't the case, however. In the end, it was Angle walking out of the arena with the WWE Championship.
As promised, Dawn Marie proved that Torrie Wilson was a sexual predator. Several weeks ago on SmackDown!, fans saw Torrie meet Dawn in room 357. But the show went off the air before we could see the entire footage. Dawn Marie's footage showed Torrie getting undressed down to her bra and panties. Finally, when the two girls began to kiss, Al Wilson demanded that the footage stop. Not wanting to upset her fianc, Dawn Marie agreed and the footage was stopped.

Triple H again puts himself over at a pay per view and has a 2 star match with Shawn Michaels in a match that never shouldve been given over 30 minutes! Triple H shouldn't have even been wrestling, as his knee was banged up and he has trouble doing any moves at all. Triple H has yet to let any of the younger stars go over him.

However, the 2 out of 3 Falls match between Shawn Micheals & Triple H was a bit disappointing. It dragged on way too much and was too long! It was very slow at times and the action was a bit bland. The part in which Shawn Micheals whacks Triple H over the forehead w/ a burning 2X4 wrapped in barbed wire is quite interesting. Also, the cage match was entertaining in some ways, especially at the end when Shawn leaps off the cage and crashes HHH through a table! The climax in the 3rd Fall (ladder match) was obviously stolen from the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches, but it's still cool when Shawn is shoved off of a ladder through 4 stacked tables!

What a great match to kick off the PPV! Raw's 4 top Tag Teams square off in this Elimination match for their chance at being World Tag Team Champions. After a few minutes; The Dudleyz hit a 3D on Christian and Bubba goes for the pin, but unbeknownst to him, Regal made a blind tag. Regal and Bubba have a small package pin battle before Regal finally gets the advantage, grabbing Bubba's tights to get the pin. The Dudleyz have been eliminated. The Un-Americans are eliminated almost immediately after when Goldust pins Regal after a powerslam. The final 2 teams are down to Jericho and Christian against Booker T and Goldie. We get some nice back and forth tag team action from both teams, as they both take turns working each other over for awhile. This was an even better showing from Jericho/Christian and Booker/Goldie than there match they had at No Mercy. Several close calls between Jericho and Booker as the match comes to a close but in the end it's Booker who scores the pinfall victory after dropping Jericho with a Book End for the win and the World Tag Team Championships. Spectacular match that even the crowd loved to start off the night. The Coach conducts a post-match interview with Booker who says that despite the critics, the people believed in them and that they're now the World Tag Team Champions

2.) Edge vs A-Train

This was the beginning of Matt Bloom's Smackdown push as he'd recently be re-christened as A-Train over on the blue brand and was being booked as the show's new monster heel. To put over his dominance, he injured Rey Mysterio's knee with a steel chair, weeks before the PPV and tried doing the same to Edge. This turned out to be a fairly a good back and forth match than what was expected. Edge really stands his own, which frustrates the Train, causing him to grab a steel chair and whack Edge in the knee with it for the DQ. A-Train tries to perform a post-match assault on Edge with the chair, but Edge dropkicks the chair in Train's face before obliterating him with the chair

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit

Anyone who knew the history between Benoit and Eddie didn't need to hear it to know that this match was going to be a treat in and of itself. Benoit and Guerrero fought several times in WCW and a few times in WWE and every single encounter was an epic one. Just like all of their other matches, this was a technical work of art. Benoit and Guerrero work and wear each other down with as many of their technically sound moves that they have in their arsenal. Both men kick out of moves that most expected to be the end of the match. It's a match where they both throw everything at each other ""but the kitchen sink"". While Eddie distracts the referee, Chavo attacks Benoit from behind on the outside with one of the Tag Team Championships but it's still not enough to keep the Rabid Wolverine down. After lots of submission holds, slams, and pins dished out; it's Benoit who prevails after making Eddie tap to the Crossface in an amazing 15+ minute technical bout. This was a WRESTLING match folks! Amazing and forgotten tremendous match

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Paul Heyman enters Stephanie McMahon's (who looked fascinating) office and tries to make her change her mind about Brock Lesnar's suspension to alter Brock's likely decision to be in Kurt Angle's corner in the WWE Championship match. Stephanie refuses and states that Brock's suspension is lifted and that if Brock wants to be in Kurt's corner during the championship match, then it's up to Brock himself. Heyman tells Stephanie that if Brock interferes, Big Show will break his neck

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To further the awful Torrie/Al/Dawn love triangle storyline; Dawn Marie comes to the ring with Al Wilson in hand to show a tape of her seducing Torrie in her hotel room. So basically how it all went down was Dawn Marie began a relationship with Torrie's dad, Al. Torrie didn't like this and the feud became really heated when Dawn announced that she and Al were engaged. Dawn came up with an ultimatum for Torrie and told Torrie to come to her hotel room after a Smackdown one night and if she showed up and did what she said; Dawn wouldn't marry Al. So now we're at the PPV and Dawn is referring to Torrie as a sexual predator and says that Torrie didn't show up because she was embarrassed about what happened. Dawn shows the tape of her seducing Torrie and just as things are about to get interestingl; Al demands the tape to be stopped, which gets him a lot of heat. This is the only memorable thing from the Torrie/Dawn feud. Everything else was forgettable as this was just as bad as the Katie Vick storyline Raw had only 2 months before. 2002 wasn't a good year for relationship storylines. Tazz said it best ""I'd rather pass a kidney stone than watch Al Wilson."" Me too Tazz, me too.

4.) Kane vs Batista w/Ric Flair

Basic match here. Nothing special going on here. Kane was involved in some pretty good PPV matches from the time he had returned that August, but that streak ended here with this less than stellar match against Batista. Not a good showing for Batista's PPV debut match either. Batista botches a Batista Bomb on Kane but the crowd was too dead for the match to care. 3 Ric Flair interferences later and Batista manages to get the Batista Bomb the second time around and pins Kane for the win

5.) WWE Women's Championship Triple Threat Match: Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria (c)

Not so decent Women's Championship match to feature 3 of the toughest divas to ever step in a ring. The build-up was decent though that showed the hate the 3 women had for each other--although it was mostly the hate that Trish and Jacqueline had for Victoria. The match was fair at the start but screw ups come in nearing the end. There was an awkward moment in the match where Trish pins Jackie and Charles Robinson awkwardly stalls to make the pin because Victoria was late coming in the ring to break up the pin. Then at the end, Trish clotheslines Jackie in the corner and went for a bulldog but Jackie falls to the mat following the clothesline. Victoria hits Trish with the Women's Championship at an angle Robinson couldn't see and pins Jackie to retain the championship.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Backstage segment with Kurt Angle reminding Brock Lesnar of how Paul Heyman screwed him over at Survivor Series and how if Lesnar is in Angle's corner, he'll only be 20 feet away from Heyman. Brock tells Angle he won't regret it and just to make sure; Angle pops in a tape from Survivor Series of Heyman screwing Lesnar out of the WWE Championship

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWE Championship Match: Big Show (c) w/Paul Heyman vs Kurt Angle

Fairly good WWE Championship match. However it was so obvious that Angle would win the match since all of the build-up for the match was about Angle getting Brock's suspension lifted to help him beat Big Show. A few close calls here and there that definitely make the match more intense. A ""we want Brock"" chant breaks out nearing the end of the match. Of course this match wouldn't truly live up to it's build-up if the referee didn't get knocked out. After the ref takes his bump, A-Train interferes and lays out Angle. Big Show capitalizes with a Chokeslam on Angle and it was right at that moment that Brock Lesnar appeared from out of nowhere and dropped Show with an F5 and sprints after Heyman to the backstage area. Angle takes advantage of the opportunity and pins Show to get the win. It was a good match but the predictability of the outcome was way too high here

7.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship 3 Stages of Hell Match: Triple H w/Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels  (First Fall: Street Fight/Second Fall: Steel Cage/Third Fall: Ladder Match)

In one of the greatest matches of Triple H and Shawn Michaels' careers and in my opinion the second best match they had against each other (first best being at SummerSlam), they'd bring their 2002 feud to an end in this hellaciously bloody and brutal 3 Stages of Hell Match all to establish themselves as the top star on the Raw brand. The last 3 Stages of Hell match that had taken place on PPV was between Triple H and Stone Cold at No Way Out in 2001 and that one was amazing; so you knew this one was too. Ric Flair gets himself banned from ringside for the match after trying to attack Michaels for mocking him before the match. The match starts off normal but gets violent pretty soon. Weapons are pulled out within minutes. Triple H draws first blood after getting nailed in between the eyes with a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire; shades of No Way Out 2000. In the end, Triple H stands tall and wins the first fall with a Pedigree on Shawn.

As the cage lowers for the second match, Triple H brings in several weapons to use inside the cage. Shawn tastes blood next after getting catapulted into the cage linked fence by Triple H. Flair returns to ringside and tries to prevent Shawn from escaping the cage but takes a beating and gets busted open with a steel chair as a price. Shawn gets the win of the second fall after delivering Sweet Chin Music to Triple H, followed by a body splash off the top of the cage through a table.

In the final fall, both Shawn and Triple H; already bloody and beaten square off in a Ladder Match with the World Title suspended above the ring. Michaels attempts another splash on Trips, this time off the ladder, but takes a sick crash to the mat. HBK hits a Superkick on Triple H and slowly makes his way up the ladder only to be stopped at the last minute by Triple H who pushes Shawn off a 20 foot ladder, through 4 tables stacked at ringside. The Game makes his way up the ladder and retrieves the championship and win the match. Amazing main event to close Armageddon! Despite what anyone may say, it was a great match! This match was not about wrestling, it was about violence and brutality and it lived up to that. I just wish Shawn's reign as World Champion lasted a bit longer than it did

Overall: Armageddon 2002 was a fair PPV. Most matches on the card delivered quite well in the ring. There were the matches and segments like Kane vs Batista, the Dawn Marie/Al Wilson angle, the Women's Championship match, and the random John Cena rapping segment that were better left off the PPV but overall, Armageddon turned out to be quite a nice PPV to close out 2002 for WWE PPVs.",1419033600,,11819,5.086215797625194

Steel Cage match was pretty short, Triple H picked Shawn Michaels a part for most of this, althought Michaels had his part in the cage. By this time, there was a lot of these 2 selling their injuries. Ladder Match was very short, only a few minutes. A nice move to end it--one man goes through the table on the outside off of the ladder, nothing we havn't seen before. So, these 2 just had it back then. They had a hell of a rivalry, one of the best in WWE history. Great match. Match of the night.

Booker t & Goldust vs. Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Regal & Storm
A solid match to start things off. The team of Booker & Goldust with the Dudleyz performed some good double teaming with each other. The crowd really got behind the Dudley Boys. The first two eliminations came so near to each other, it was one after another. The last two teams put a on solid tag match. Y2J & Christian isolated Goldust from Booker here. Once Booker got the tag, he cleaned house. A lot of near falls. Certainly a crowning moment for Booker t & Goldust. A very good opener. 4.5/5

This was a match for Edge getting revenge for himself and Rey. A-Train used that big body of his to wear down Edge. Edge got in some good counters to A-Train's moves. A chair would get introduce which would cause a dq. Edge gave A-Train a very hard chair shot to the head after the match. A shockingly good match. 3.75/5

A match that was very good but also could have been better. Both Eddie & Chris used some good submissions on each other & reversed each other moves.

Angle would use his speed and his quickness to try and take down Show. Angle also did some stuff you hardly see him do on a daily basis. Kurt pulled off some impressive moves on the bigger Big Show. Brock Lesnar also got payback on Heyman & Big Show which would allow Angle to capitalize on it. Pretty awesome match. 4.5/5

7. 2 out of 3 Falls for the World Heavyweight Title
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H with Ric Flair
The first fall was a street fight. The second fall was a steel cage and the third fall was a ladder match.

I have to say the best fall was the street fight. The street fight was very brutal. Maybe even more brutal than their match from summer slam. All kinds of weapons would get brought in such as a steel chair, trash cans, and even a barbed wire 2x4. Hunter really works on the knee of hbk for the better part and using all kinds of ""toys"" to punish the knee of hbk. Very good first fall. To me, best of the 3.

Before the cage got lowered, Triple h would fill the ring with more weapons. This second fall felt a little slow at times but it did had some good usage with the cage. Flair would get himself involved in this fall. HBK would splash Triple H from the top of the cage through a table to tie things up.

The ladder match was without of a doubt the slowest fall of the three. The ladder only came into play when needed. Both men took a few hard bumps on and off the ladder. Shawn would crash through four tables at the end and the game would become a seven time world champion. Overall a very brutal match. 5/5

Armageddon was indeed that, Armageddon. A pretty good ppv to pick up.",1220832000,,3710,4.2631578947368425
7979416,2,B000087F5G,"What a glorious year for the WWE this was.  We witnessed a Hogan/Rock dream match we never though see.  Shawn Michaels returned to the WWE after a few years.  The New World Order wreaked a little chaos, even if only for a short while.  Triple H, Chris Benoit, and Eddie Guerrero made their return to TV after a year of absence.  Remember the ""SmackDown Six""?  I know I'll never forget those great matches.  Even the brand split was incredibly successful at the time.

So, what better way than to close this tremendous year for the WWE by putting together a complete pile of garbage!?

The biggest problem with ARMAGEDDON 2002 is that it never gets off the ground.  Take, for instance, the opening Fatal Fourway Elimination Match for RAW's World Tag Team Titles: How did eight wrestlers this gifted leave me disappointed?  The answer is ""predictability"".  Even if you have no knowledge of WWE history, you can tell how this first contest is going to play out from bell to bell.  Well, the last few minutes were pretty exciting, but the buildup was unusually slow until we got down to the final two teams.

Next up is a SMACKDOWN grudge match between Edge and A-Train.  I think most people dislike this match because they don't like A-Train.  To me, I really liked A-Train's physical abilities, and Edge is awesome, of course.  But man, this brief little scuffle didn't amount to anything except for the finish.  Who'd have thought the TV hype and PPV finale all revolved around a steel chair?

ARMAGEDDON 2002 not only fails to get off the ground, but it buries itself deep when Dawn Marie and Al Wilson take a painful amount of time to recap their torrid affair.  I know WWE superstars never went to Lee Strasberg's acting lessons, but Al Wilson is one of the worst actors on the planet.  Period!

The most shocking disappointment to me was how unimpressed I was by a technical showdown between Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit.  I regretfully call this the worst of their many matches together.  I love methodical wrestling.  In fact, I'm a bit of ground grappling and technical junkie.  But this whole contest was a plodding, brutally slow presentation.  Not a terrible match, but me giving these guys less than a ""7"" really says something in my book.

In fact, I'd rather watch the match that followed Guerrero & Benoit.  That's right, I probably preferred Kane facing Batista in a pointless big-man contest.  The two giants battled in a back-and-forth fight that made both men look good.  However, there were some a few serious botches that are starting to creep back into my memory.

And can someone explain how in the hell a Triple Threat involving Trish Stratus, Victoria, and Jacqueline --- three of the best female athletes in the company's history --- put together such an embarassing hodge-podge?!  My goodness, this ARMAGEDDON just can't get its act together at all!

Well, the only parts left of this dismal PPV are the main events.  Thankfully, they're pretty good.

The first main event is Kurt Angle challenging Big Show for the WWE Championship.  Angle is a legend, and Big Show had a fantastic year from mid-2002 to mid-2003.  Both men complemented each other very well, and the Fort Lauderdale crowd was going nuts from bell to bell.  Unfortunately, these guys only got to wrestle about 12 minutes, and the run-in finish was yet another example of WWE giving away their best secrets.  I can understand the WWE telegraphing their TV surprises, but if you can't see this PPV surprise coming from a mile away, I'm astonished.

World Heavyweight champion Shawn Michaels and Triple H engage in one of many battles.  This time, they compete in a Two-Out-of-Three Falls Match, each contest having its own stipulation.  Somehow, ARMAGEDDON 2002 brought out the worst of two rivalries: Benoit/Eddie, and now HBK/HHH.  Don't get me wrong, this is an above-average showcase.  But out of all the classic encounters between these two men, I've enjoyed this one the least.  Considering that this is a 45-minute battle featuring a Street Fight, a Steel Cage, AND a Ladder Match...I'm stunned!  And it's not as if one fall clearly stands out above the others.  Nope, I didn't prefer one particular contest over the other.  This would've been great if performed by another pair of wrestlers.  But from Triple H and Michaels, I expected more.  Sorry guys, but this good match is badly overrated.

You know, the SURVIVOR SERIES that came 1 month before this PPV is my all-time favorite PPV.  And the ROYAL RUMBLE that came 1 month after this is my favorite of that particular PPV series.  Sadly, ARMAGEDDON 2002 is a poor monkey in the middle.

I enjoyed the main events, but the rest of this card was unbelievable poor.  Where was Rey Mysterio?  Where was Jeff Hardy?  Where were the Cruiserweights?  Where was Rob Van Dam?  Where was Brock Lesnar...oh wait, never mind.

This whole card is just unimpressive to read in print!  And, it's even worse in execution.  The only real light at the end of this dark tunnel --- other than the excellent PPVs that preceded and followed this crap --- is the bonus match on the DVD.  It's a Fatal Fourway Elimination Match between Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Edge, and Eddie Guerrero.  The winner got the WWE Title shot on this PPV, but each guy put on an impressive showing that surpassed anything they did on this event.  It's the best part of the DVD.

People, I will always take the WWE over any other form of televised wrestling.  But this was 3 of the longest hours I've taken from them.",1220400000,,5922,4.767258382642998

7979418,4,B000087F5G,"Id been looking at this PPV for awhile but never got around to buy it. I was buying some other WWE dvds and just went for this dvd. It was a decent PPV but the main event stole the show with two very huge moments.

Chris Jericho & Christian VS Booker T & Golddust VS Lance Storm & William Regal VS Dudley Boyz: Back on PPVS in 2001 and 2002, this match was always present it seems. I guess WWE wants to prove they still have somewhat of a tag team division. A decent match.

Edge Vs A-Train: Stupid match and a stupid ending.

Chris Benoit VS Eddie Guerrero: Not the best match between the two. Still a very good ""wrestling"" match.

Kane VS Batista: A short, useless match. Batista was still learning the ropes.

Victoria VS Trish Stratus VS Jacqueline: Bathroom break.

Big Show VS Kurt Angle: Brock Lensar helps Angle win the world title in an uneventful Smackdown title match.

3 Stages Of Hell (street fight/cage match/ladder match): World Champion Shawn Michaels VS Triple H: Very good idea but not the best match these two would have. The street fight started off slow but did have one high spot. Michaels nails Triple H in the face with a flamming barbwire bat! it was very awesome to see. I think Cactus Jack did the same to Triple H in there hell in the cell match but could be mistaken. The street fight was slow and took up alot of time. The cage match was fast paced and a good match. The ladder match was short but had anther crazy moment. Michaels falls thru 3 or 4 tables outside the ring when Triple H pushed him off the ladder. As I write this, I honestly don't remember how those tables got like that. Still the last few matches were fast paced and fun.

This PPV was not that great. The Main Event was worth watching but if they put it on anther dvd, it would be better. The extra match is pretty good as well and even better then the match on the PPV. Also, the set was pretty cool with fire surrounding it. I don't know WWE never tried a set like that again, it was cool. The theme song to the PPV is also good..anyone know who sings it? It sounds like a rip off of the Doors.",1196812800,,2097,4.225
7979419,3,B000087F5G,"Four Way Elimination Match: World Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Booker T & Kane vs. Lance Storm & William Regal vs. Dudley Boyz - Don't let the match title fool you because Storm, Regal, and the Dudleys are eliminated within the first couple of minutes...with Bubba Ray screwing up the rollup attempt.  From there, it was all about Goldust proving that he wasn't the ""weak link"" in the team as he finally became the World Tag Team Champions with Booker T in the end.

Edge vs. A-Train - They gave Albert a new nickname & renewed push by taking Mysterio out of action for a month so Edge was out for revenge for his partner.  The match itself was just boring as Albert just isn't very good in the ring and Edge at this point in his career didn't have the capability of carrying his opposition.  Dud match.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was before Eddie was doing the ""lie, cheat, steal"" gimmick so it was a straight up wrestling match without the usual Eddie humor we get from time to time.  It's not a classic encounter as their later & earlier matches have been but it's still a good solid pure wrestling match that you would expect from these two.

Kane vs. Batista - This match was just like the Edge/Albert match in that it just wasn't good & boring for the most part.  Batista was still very green at the time & Kane is just like Edge in that he can only carry his opposition so far in the match but it just didn't work here for another dull match.

Womens Champion Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline - This was a solid fast paced matchup here between the women.  It was good but nothing memorable.

WWE Champion Big Show vs. Kurt Angle - Big Show continued to show what his true potential since moving over to SmackDown & it continued here as he went against Kurt Angle.  A-Train appears again but the real treat was the appearence of Brock Lesnar helping Kurt Angle win the WWE Title...and starting their roads to WrestleMania XIX.

3 Stages Of Hell (street fight/cage match/ladder match): World Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Just like Stone Cold vs. Triple H at No Way Out 2001 in that you get 3 full main events in one match.  The story here was will we see the ""humble"" Shawn Michaels or ""Heartbreak Kid?""  Just a side note but watch before the match gets started as Ric Flair kept getting into it with the referee to the point where he gets shoved on his ass...it's funny.  The street fight was brutal as they didn't do alot of weapons spots but just instead beat the hell out of each other & occassionally use weapons such as a flaming barbed wire board.  The cage match was around 10 mins. with the only memorable spot being HBK's dive onto Triple H though a table.  The ladder match wasn't the calibur of HBK's previous ladder matches but it was still good concidering the circumstances with the finish of HBK falling off the ladder though loads of tables being a highlight to the point where WWE continued to use that footage in their ""Don't try this at home"" advertisement before any WWE home video.

Somewhere on here as well was the Dawn Marie/Torrie Wilson ""hotel room"" footage which was nothing more than them being in lingere/bra & panties and resulting in a kiss.

Overall, this was a good PPV but it's nothing memorable past the main event (and the hotel footage if your a very horny man) so this is something I would recommend for a rental or at a cheap cost.",1182729600,,3428,4.437001594896332
