1265212,5,B00003CXKD,"Nutty Professor 2 was one of the funniest movies this summer. It was definitely better and had a better story than the other fat suiyt comedy this year, Big Mamma's House. This one is better because we get more of Eddie at what he does best and we get Janet Jackson, who lights up the screen with her presence. Granny Klump is the best. She makes you laugh every time you see her. Great movie! Funny movie! Excellent Characters! Get it now!",971222400,11,440,4.378048780487805
1265213,3,B00003CXKD,"i was dreading seeing this movie, but in the event it wasn't so bad.  I thought both Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson were very talented (Jackson's a LOT better than Madonna and just 'cos she was the pretty girl in the movie I don't see why everyone has to be catty about her) and the last scene was quite moving, but I thought sometimes it just went too far, i.e with the hamster, which was kinda stupid.  But I don't think I'd bother seeing this movie again - at times it all got too dumb.",971136000,,489,4.136842105263158
1265214,2,B00003CXKD,"I was expecting a repeat of the first one. Nope. Bad jokes, boring plot and Buddy Love is just annoying. Im afraid this one hit an all time low. The only funny jokes come with Dean Richmond and Granny chasing down Buddy, thinking hes the stripper man. Otherwise a low blow.",970963200,,273,4.372549019607843
1265215,2,B00003CXKD,"I can no longer remember the days when Eddie Murphy has made a funny movie. He is now involved in movies that will appeal to everyone and pad his wallet more than his reputation as a comedian. This film is no exception. The first film made a good anount of money, so someone had the bright idea to make a sequal. That was mistake number one. The second mistake was to take a scene that was funny from the original film, and make it into a feature length film. The scene with his entire family, which was Eddie on a huge ego trip, was taken out, and now has a very poorly written film surrounding it. Janet Jackson may have been a high point, that being that she could actually act a little, but the rest of the movie was displaying what can happen when a star gets too much power, and such a large ego, that it is impossible for the film studio to say no to him.",970531200,2,862,4.106508875739645
1265216,2,B00003CXKD,"Eddie Murphy proves once again (not that we need any more convincing) that he deserves to someday be included on Hollywood's ""All Time Greatest"" list.  Jim Carey he's not, but he doesn't need to be!  Recent comparisons between Carey's character in ""Liar Liar"" and Sherman Klump serve absolutely no purpose.  All things considered, Klump is pretty boring.  What a delight if Murphy ever decides to surround himself with better writers (with a deeper vision) who can provide him enough substance to showcase his talents in a more positive light.  No doubt, most of the creative juices for this shoddy material could have originated from any low class joint that doesn't bother to remove its restroom graffiti.  How shameful if this gifted genius is never involved in a classic film that stands the test of time.  It becomes increasingly unlikely that future generations will appreciate Murphy if his work becomes outdated within a few months of being released.  Theater audiences howled when some  sap sucker was subjected to anal rape by a giant hamster!  They howled again when an old Negro ate a piece of meat courtesy of the Heimleck maneuver.  If this is your thing . . . Please don't allow me to be the one pushing you to take that vital next step toward reaching your potential as a human being. The oversexed grandmother bit was a novel idea, and apparently based on the actor's real life flesh and blood.  Teaming up with a terribly impotent but sympathetic male figure was funny, but this type of gag only goes so far!  Janet Jackson was released from her ""nasty girl"" image to play a character analogous to ""Darla"" comforting Spanky, Buckwheat, and Alfalfa . . . But those fellows had the advantage of rubbing elbows with true professionals in the critical areas of writing, directing, and film production.  In Nutty Professor II, we do get to know the Klump family much better, but it doesn't really mean anything.",970272000,3,1924,4.826219512195122

1265326,3,B00003CXKD,"Released in 2000 and directed by Peter Segal, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps brings back Eddie Murphy as Sherman Klump, grossly overweight professor with a good heart, whos dating a new girl  (Janet Jackson) and still battling with his thin, charismatic alter ego, Buddy Love (also Murphy), although the way Buddy manifests is different. Larry Miller is on hand as the dean of the university while Melinda McGraw plays a representative of a company interested in purchasing a youth-giving potion. Like the first movie, Murphy plays all the adult Klump members (Granny, Mama, Papa and Ernie).

Janet is a superb replacement for Jada Pinkett Smith as Shermans girlfriend and, like the first film, Sherman is a sympathetic character while Buddy Love is charismatic. I might be in the minority, but I wasn't a fan of the two Klump dinner table scenes in the 1996 movie, which explains why I feel this sequel is a drop in quality: There are too many tasteless scenes with the Klumps  not to mention unnecessarily crude scenes in general  and not enough with the best characters, Sherman and Buddy Love. Buddy in particular is mysteriously absent much of the time, which is inexplicable in that he was one of the comedic highlights of the earlier movie.

The way Eddie plays all the different characters is genius and well-executed, but the films simply not as funny as the first one, unless you favor flatulence jokes and vulgar humor in general. The first movie had both, but theres more of it here and less of what was good.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot mostly in the Los Angeles area, but also Moore's Crossroads, South Carolina (presumably the opening church scene).

1265824,1,B00003CXKD,"There are some films that entertain for the sheer campy value of it all and then there are those films that delve so far into their own wanton stupidity that they abandon all restraint that thus lose all respect.  `Nutty Professor II: The Klumps' is one of those films that just doesn't know what to do with itself.  It lathers on the offensive in a way that gets a laugh but doesn't get to the root of the audience.  It fades quickly.  This is particularly true because of the fact that the gags are the only entertaining aspect of the film.  The core of the film, the plot itself, is a mess.  The main character, Sherman Klump, is a bore.  His whole plight (literally battling his inner demon) isn't the least bit interesting.  Add to that the fact that the token `girlfriend' role was given to a lackluster Janet Jackson (what happened to you girl?).  The film itself just doesn't work.  It is choppy and unengaged and forgettable.  You'll laugh, but you won't care enough about this `stupid' film to bother popping it in for another round.

1265828,4,B00003CXKD,"Calling Eddie Murphy a comedic genius is an understatement. Likewise, calling Janet Jackson a singing superstar is also an understatement. Now where would you find these two names together I hear you say? Well in the sequel to one of the funniest films ever made in recent years of course. Unless you've been hiding for the last 2 months or just never ever listen to the radio, you won't have missed the new Janet Jackson song that goes round and round in your head forever. The catchy summer tune is one of the songs that although annoying, it's kind of catchy. Well `Doesn't Really Matter' is the theme tune to the new Eddie Murphy movie - Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps. But Ms Jackson doesn't just appear on the soundtrack; she's in the movie as well! In the movie, we see the lovable 28-stone Sherman Klump return with the rest of his family entail. If you think your way back to the 1996 re-make of the Jerry Lewis Nutty Professor, then you'll remember Buddy Love, Sherman's alter-ego. Just as Professor Klump thought he'd got rid of him for good, Buddy pops up again - but not without a plan. He breaks free of Sherman's body for good and is determined to ruin his plans to we his colleague Denise Gaines played by the illustrious Janet Jackson. Sherman's new youth formula has fallen into Buddy's hands, and it looks like Klump is losing his intelligence - for good! From the beginning I knew that it was going to be a laughter packed movie because judging by the first scene, Eddie's performances as Sherman, Mama, Papa, Ernie and last but not least Grandma Klump are so believable, that it is as if they are five different people. The second most important Klump character in the film is Granny Klumps whose sexual appetite knows no bounds, and as she spots Buddy sneaking around the Klump family home, she has only one thing on her mind! As a singer, people don't realise that Janet has a long history of acting. As a child, she starred in many American sitcoms including Fame and Good Times and went on to star in the 1993 John Singleton (Shaft, Boyz N The Hood) film `Poetic Justice' alongside the late Tupac (Shakur). `I've never stopped receiving scripts since Poetic Justice,' Janet said, `but there was either a scheduling conflict, the script was too similar to Poetic Justice or I didn't really like it. But when Nutty came along, I jumped at the chance. I mean, who wouldn't want to work with Eddie?' Although as a Janet fan, you may say I'm being biased, Janet really does a good job acting here. `I really wanted people to think of me as Denise. I hope that people will be able to separate Denise from Janet.' And one genuinely can. However, the movie isn't 100% perfect. Where it faulters is in terms of a decent storyline. It felt like a bit of a re-trip to the first movie with a similar plot. The film, though, is hilarious and will have you repeating lines for days after it, but my only recommendation is that you see it twice. The first time round, you are getting to grips with the storyline, and I have to admit, because I didn't catch all the jokes, I didn't find it that funny. But when you go back a second time, as you know the basic storyline (which is there - despite what I said earlier), you can listen in for the jokes, as they are quite hard to catch sometimes. Altogether, Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps is very good - in fact it is one of the best sequels (save M:I2) that I have seen. It was always going to be difficult to follow up the success of The Nutty Professor, but seeing that it took over $45 million in its first weekend at the US Box Office, this is sure to be a hit in the UK as well.",1253059200,,3639,4.408618127786033

As one reviewer noted, Sherman is the most boring of all the characters, and his romantic tryst with Janet Jackson (who is surprisingly good) tends to get in the way of the script's flow.

Technical feats aside, this Klump family is rude and crude.  The dad mostly rants and talks down to everyone.  And the Grandma only knows how to talk about sex and erections, and ends up dropping her robe for a ""stripper,"" in trying to initiate sex with him, though she is supposedly happily married. This is just one of many objectionable content scenes.

I cringed a lot seeing this, and should have just dumped it, but hoped it would get better... I really can't imagine showing this to my children, or anyone.  It's not family friendly, and not that funny.  I just wanted to warn concerned parents.",1120003200,2,756,4.646616541353383

When Buddy escapes, there are two professors runnning lose and the professor's got himself a problem.

The humor is missing and in its place is a huge amount of farting and cursing and potty-mouthed, potty-minded crap. The language is terrible and I really didn't want my kids to see the shots of swinging breasts and bulging erections. As a family film it is completely inappropriate.

1266108,3,B00003CXKD,"In my review of the movie The Nutty Professor II which was released in 2000 I attempt the rate the movie based on its potential appeal to viewers. The Movie director is Peter Segal and it is from Universal Studios. The main actor in the Nutty Professor II is Eddie Murphy who plays many characters in the movie (Sherman Klump, Buddy Love, the grandmother, etc) and the primary actress is Janet Jackson who plays Denise Gaines.
The movie setting starts out with Sherman dreaming that he is getting married to his assistant professor (Denise Gaines). Then he starts having sexual reactions when he looks at Denise breast sticking out in her wedding dress.  Buddy Love reappears coming out of his rear end. Buddy Love keeps Sherman upset because he controls his personality and intelligence and has him saying rude things to everyone. Sherman is trying to get Buddy Love out his system.
Denise Gaines tells Sherman she cares for him once she finds out that she is being offered a job in Maine. And then Sherman goes to confess his love to Denise but Buddy Love takes over and he starts doing sexual actions toward her, which Denise gets very upset.
This movie is very funny and it will keep your attention. I like the more serious movies that Eddie Murphy has played in.  It is just amazing how Eddie played 5 different characters in this movie. And for Janet Jackson she is a very good actress, more than she gets credit for.

1266233,4,B00003CXKD,"I sat in utter amazement during much of this movie.  Not only is Nutty Prof 2 very funny, but very touching with themes about family and marriage.  Eddie Murphy is amazing - he plays men and women of all ages so convincingly that you can't spot ""the man in the suit"".  Thru the Klumps, Murphy provides us with some deeply emotional scenes in which he is just playing off of himself, acting to a blank space and people who really doesn't exist.  His timing and weight is perfect for each character.  All the Klumps are unique individuals, with their own dreams and fears.  I noticed also that many women who had seen this movie felt that Murphy's acting as women was very accurate.  Bravo.
The story is a dual romance film, following Sherman Klumps new love for associate professor Janet Jackson, while also showing the elder Klumps' aging marriage as it enters a crisis.  Through in a dangerous science experiment and some Buddy Love for laughs, and you've got this picture.  The Collector's Edition DVD is nice because it includes some scenes which were too naughty to include in the PG-13 theatrical release, plus some extra bloopers and a ""Making-of"" documentary (very interesting for a film like this).",1019001600,,1206,4.759615384615385

They are Mulan, the two Nutty Professor movies, and Shrek. I have rented both of the Dr. Dolittle movies. He is amazing. I just wish there could have been some passionate kissing in between Denise and Sherman. Buy the DVD. You will love the beginning of the menu.

1266235,2,B00003CXKD,"To be fair, The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps must be looked at in two ways. One should look at the performances of its star, Eddie Murphy, who plays seven different characters. One should then look at how it works as a movie. Unfortunately, the latter look almost undoes the former.
Once again, Eddie Murphy show what an extraordinary actor he is. He plays Sherman Klump, the brilliant, lovable, shy and grossly overweight professor. He also play's Sherman's father, mother, grandmother, brother and the foul-mouthed, bad-tempered Buddy Love, Sherman's accidental alter-ego. It is true that Murphy played those characters before in The Nutty Professor. Obviously, the novelty is absent in the sequel, but it should be noted that in the original, he played the family only in scenes where they were seated around a dinner table. This was done for budget reasons, as the star was not as 'bankable' at the time as he once had been. Murphy's back on top now, so the Klumps in this picture have left the table and are all over the place. This change made for a far more complex production schedule, as well as a horrendously complicated job for Murphy. That he pulls it off at all is amazing. That he pulls it off with style is nearly a miracle.
This time Sherman Klump has invented a formula which reverses the aging process. He does this at the university lab where he works, and the dean thinks they can make [money] from it. Naturally, Buddy Love is around to make sure things go wrong, including Sherman's romance with the beautiful Denise [Janet Jackson]. In addition to all this, Sherman must still deal with his madly dysfunctional family.
As for the story, it goes nowhere fast. Some scenes are quite funny, but others lack the sparkle one would hope for in such a high profile piece of entertainment. I am certain that Mr. Murphy, who often endured five hours a day in the makeup chair, had no time or energy left to devote to the plot. That was the writers' job, and I am afraid they let both us and our people-pleasing star down. Still, compared to recent letdowns such as Martin Lawrence in Big Momma's House, the movie has enough interesting moments in it to make it worth viewing.",1016409600,3,2191,4.678756476683938

1266238,3,B00003CXKD,"I saw NUTTY PROFESSOR II--THE KLUMPS in the theater when it first came out, and just bought it last month on DVD. After watching the ""Unrated Director's Cut"", I can say that it really isn't all that much different than the original PG-13 cut (which got away with a *lot* if you ask me). I think this version is a bit over-hyped on back of the DVD case: The only thing ""wilder"" about the Mariachi scene is that one extra risque` line that was added back to it. The only thing ""steamier"" about the Hot Tub scene is that Buddy's reaction is more animated. Big deal! As for the ""big surprise"" that Denise supposedly gets, I still don't get it. :)
However, this film still has it's laughs, and you just can't beat Eddie Murphy performing a total of--gasp!--8 characters, usually in the same scene. Eddie Murphy shows us yet again how extraordinarily talented of a comedic actor he is, as well as how much fun he has when doing character ensembles.  Rick Baker's makeup is superb as always, and really makes us forget that these roles are all filled by the same man. Just look at all of the huge differences (literally) between Sherman Klump, Buddy Love, Cletus & Mama Klump, Grandma, etc--it's truly amazing.
The screenplay is funny, and the directing/editing is fast-paced. All in all, it's a good, funny film, although it's definitely not for the under-13 kiddies. Forget about things like occasional plot holes, and some of the pseudo-science in it; this is a movie to just sit back and laugh with.

1266342,2,B00003CXKD,"Nobody watching ""Nutty Professor II:  The Klumps"" could ever doubt either Eddie Murphy's extraordinary talent for comic impersonation nor the ingenious skill of the special effects team that has managed to bring the actor's many characters to fruition on film.  The utterly seamless merging of all Murphy's personas into a single shot is indeed something wondrous to behold.  Unfortunately, no amount of acting or technical expertise can compensate for a weak script - for a comedy is, after all, only as good as its writing.  In the case of ""NP II,"" the writing leaves a great deal to be desired.
In many ways, the film's greatest strength turns out, ultimately, to be its greatest weakness.  Murphy is so good at delineating and inhabiting his characters that it is quite understandable that the filmmakers would want to apportion virtually equal time to each and every one of them.  This turns out to be a problem.  For one thing, it manages to dilute the focus of the film's storyline quite frequently.  Time and again, we find the narrative wandering back and forth between unrelated situations.  Just as we become involved in the affairs of one character, we shift over to the quandaries of another.
Still, this would be acceptable if the film at least managed to be funny.  It does offer a few laughs along the way, but the film's script rarely rises above the waistline in its humor.  If a joke doesn't deal with a specific body part (and we're not talking about hands, feet and noses here), it probably deals with a bodily function either sexual or scatological in nature.  I have no personal objection to dirty jokes, but when an entire film consists of nothing BUT such jokes, the whole enterprise ultimately becomes tasteless, tedious and unpleasant.  Take heed if you plan on watching this film with your young children (and note that this isn't even the UNCENSORED version!).
In terms of acting, Murphy proves once again his phenomenal ability to create characters who are offbeat, individualized and likable.  What a shame that the filmmakers were not able to craft a vehicle commensurate with his talent.",999475200,8,2120,4.901960784313726

1266435,1,B00003CXKD,"During the 3-4 months prior to Academy Award voting, the studios sponsor for the various industry guilds an abundance of free screenings of the movies thought eligible for Oscar nominations. Such screenings give the guilds' voting members, as well as the memberships at large, an opportunity to view the fruits of their labors. Each guild member can bring one guest to a screening. It was as a guest that I attended a showing of NUTTY PROFESSOR II - THE KLUMPS. The circumstances allowing me to see this movie are irrelevant, except as I refer again to the studio screenings towards the end of this review.
The plot of this comedy verges on incoherent, so please bear with my poor attempt to summarize it. Eddie Murphy plays several roles as the grossly overweight members of the Klump family, including the brilliant Professor Sherman Klump, and the professor's mother, father, grandmother and uncle. Janet Jackson, playing a professorial colleague of Sherman's at a small, private college, serves dubiously as his love interest. Sherman has developed a potion that restores youth, a discovery of potentially great wealth for the college. Unfortunately, his persona also harbors his alter ego, Buddy Love, also played by Murphy, who forces him into periodic obscene or otherwise inappropriate outbursts at awkward moments. The bulk of the film - the incoherent part - revolves around Sherman's attempt to eradicate Buddy from his personality by genetic manipulation, woo the Jackson character, and win a lucrative pharmaceutical contract for his Fountain of Youth.
Now, I'll be the first to admit that Eddie Murphy has great talent. In THE KLUMPS, his ability to assume multiple roles is unquestionably demonstrated. And, the costuming and make-up enabling him to pull this off are first rate. However, the plot, which relies heavily on over-the-top bathroom humor to get the laughs, is loud, chaotic and positively moronic. As I've indicated in the first paragraph, the studio, Universal in this case, apparently thinks this film of Oscar caliber by the very fact of its free screenings. Considering the evident target audience (pre-pubescent juveniles?), I cannot imagine who they think would even be available to nominate in any award category, much less vote for, this work of crude nonsense.  What could they've possibly been thinking in Universal's corridors of power? The movie's strong points (costuming and make-up), even assuming that they're equal to or better than those in Y2K's truly great films, are positively swamped in the swill.

Janet Jackson makes a great co-star aside Eddie Murphy. What amazes me is the fact that Eddie can play 5 characters so well. As a bonus, there are some funny, short outtakes on the movie.

Unlike most comedies from previous or current SNL stars nowadays, this movie is more than an extended 10 minute skit. It has a human side that draws your sympathy for The Nutty Professor (Sherman Klump) and a decent love story with Janet Jackson who is a better actress than she gets credit for.
The Collector's Edition has the standard 10 minute clip on brief tidbits that went into making the movie.  It's interesting to see the make-up and special effects that went into making this movie.
All in all, a fun movie to watch the first time but I'm not sure about owning the movie.  If you are a big Eddie Murphy or comedy fan, you'll enjoy this in your collection, but for the rest of us, it might be better just renting.",979948800,,1027,4.4866310160427805
1266438,3,B00003CXKD,"The first movie is great. Funny as heck! One of Murphy's best. BUT, not the second movie. Parts were over-played. The plot...forget it...LoL. You're better off renting these first before you buy.",979776000,,195,5.125
1266439,4,B00003CXKD,"One of his best works yet! He headlines a all-star cast as the Klumps. From Mamma Klump to the grandmother, it shows why he is the best actor ever. And it adds the beautiful Janet Jackson to take Jada Smith place in the movie. From beginning to end will have you rolling in your seats. Watch out for the part when the family are at the buffet resturant. If that doesn't show Eddie's talent, I don't know what will. Better than the first. Hope that it's not the last we see from him.",979603200,,482,4.193548387096774
1266529,5,B00003CXKD,"Now, I know what you're thinking. How can a sequel be better than the original? Well, it rarely happens that a sequel is better than the original, with THE KLUMPS it has. THE KLUMPS is a hilarious film, that will leave you laughing for a while after you see it. It picks up where the original left off, to expand on Sherman Klump's family. This time around, the plot is better, as is the quality of the film. Thus, I think it was better than the original.
  THE KLUMPS was not as groundbreaking as the first installment. However, it shows just how talented Eddie Murphy really is. Talented enough is he to play all the members of the Klump family (save the little boy) and a white exercise guru. Each character is wonderfully played and is unique. Also, as Sherman's love interest, we see the amazingly talented Janet Jackson. She is incredibly beautiful and adds real sparkle to the film. Her chemistry with Sherman is extremely believable, making the romance part of the film great.
  In essence, THE KLUMPS is a great film with a great plot and cast. If you love very very funny comedies, with great plots and a sparkle of romance, then THE KLUMPS is a film you should have. You won't be disappointed. Enter the very funny Klump family today!",979344000,,1245,4.544642857142857
1266530,3,B00003CXKD,"How much one likes ""The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"" depends on how much Eddie Murphy you can stand.  After grossing more than $125 million at the box office, I would have to conclude that moviegoers couldn't get enough.  This sequel is a one-man show built around a character skit from the first movie.  Murphy plays eight different roles and gives a tour de force performance without the benefit of any story whatever.  I got the impression that the writers were superfluous anyway, since Murphy was obviously ad libbing about 90% of the time.
The humor is lowbrow and delivers a good deal of physical comedy laced with sexual innuendo.  Though Murphy's caricatures are consistently droll, they rely too much on unflattering stereotypes of blacks.  The first dinner scene is a rehash of the dinner scene from the first film.  After that scene, most of the film is a repetition of the same tired sight gags.  Though Murphy's amusing electricity runs through every character, once the novelty wears off the film's appeal wears thin.
Kudos to the makeup department for an outstanding job on Murphy's various alter egos.  Otherwise, the production of this film was nothing out of the ordinary.  Larry Miller also gets a very honorable mention as the obnoxious Dean Richmond, getting his just deserts at the hands of a giant hamster.
This film has some laughs but not enough substance for a feature length movie.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add two or three points if you are an Eddie Murphy fan.",978825600,,1489,4.796078431372549
1266531,2,B00003CXKD,"This movie proves, once again, that the sequal never lives up to the original.  The Klumps, trying to ride on the tails of its predecessor, attempts to give the one-dimensional Klump family a second dimension to their characters.  FAILED!  While the movie is very funny (why it got a second star in my opinion), it tried to take on a more serious family aspect which left the film dragging slowly to the next punch-line delivered by Eddie Murphy in any of his hilarious disguises.  If you want a funny movie, I suggest going with the first Nutty Professor where the one-sided Klumps are more suited for their roles, though less present in the overall story line.  If you're an avid fan of Grandma Klump and her ""Cletus-cutdowns,"" then this is your movie... though I could have done without seeing her making moves on Buddy Love.

1266532,4,B00003CXKD,"In some ways, this good sequel has more heart and soul, then the first movie was back in 1996. The plot:Sherman Klump(Eddie Murphy) is in love with an beautiful woman(Janet Jackson, she does good acting in this one) discover in his new formula to become young again for a short while, but he`s trying to make it work to make it young and healty for forever, anyone who`s has taken the formula but Sherman has feel his alter ago Buddy Love is still inside trying to control him. In fact, sherman did destory a part of his cells to destory Buddy. Then one night, a dog walk on the lab, with his dog hair, fell in the floor and the dog accidently drop something and letting Buddy Love free with a part of DNA Dog!. Now sherman has to face Buddy again but this time in a different way. Buddy is more human than ever but Buddy problem has a dog sense in him.

1266533,4,B00003CXKD,"The Nutty Professor 2 was hysterically funny at times.  All of the characters were very well played and they had their own individual humor.  You just can't say enough about that Grandma.  She was the funniest character of them all.  But I do think that this movie went onto a different, deeper level.  It showed Sherman's struggles with his girlfriend and Buddy Love and soon you feel great sympathy for him.  But that's what Eddie Murphy is capable of doing.  I think only he could pull this kind of thing off.  And he does pull it off again.  But as the movie wore on the jokes got to be a little stale.  It was funny the whole way through but the characters got a little predictable.  The family scenes are very funny but sometimes too much of a good thing is not good.  Also another good thing about this movie was that you didn't have to have seen the first movie to know what is going on.  The Nutty Professor 2 was a wonderfully acted movie with a great story that did leave you with a good feeling.  4 Stars",977961600,,1016,4.278947368421052

This film was HORRIBLE! I hate it when people liked it! Sure, he did 9 roles, but can't he talk about something other than sex?

With that being said however, I realized that the main draw of the movie was Eddie.  If the family members were played by different actors, this movie would have been terrible.  I mean, there were so many stupid scenes in this movie, (The Space Shuttle, Giant Hamster, etc) that it was a pain to watch.  The humor relied on crude, sex related jokes and toilet humor.  People have been saying that this is not a drama, but a comedy.  If so...then where are the laughs?  I for one do not find all of the farts that funny...",977616000,2,680,4.299212598425197

But let's face it, we all howled with laughter at both ""family"" scenes in Nutty Prof, and the family are as funny again this time round. And yes the film is somewhat thin on plot, but it has a lot more plot than, say, M:i2, which despite being a great film added nothing new to the original. Klumps add a lot more - they show that the family are ""real"", well-rounded (no pun intended) people - and still completely hilarious.
I think if everyone approaches this movie knowing and accepting that it's a sequel, they will get lots out of it! Stop comparing it to Nutty Professor 1!",976147200,2,776,4.433566433566433

1266635,3,B00003CXKD,"The Nutty Proffesor 2: The Klumps, was a movie that could have been fabulous but stunk. The whole plot of the movie was pretty stupid and far fetched. The only parts of the movie that were funny were the parts when Buddy the dog was changed into the form of Eddie Murphy.
 Another part that could've been enjoyed was the part with the baby on the boardroom table. This part was ruined when it was put into coming attractions. But they have to show something funny there right?
 Despite the fact that the whole plot idea was dumb and far fetched, the movie still had a few good laughs. Watch the first movie instead if you are looking for a good story and lots of laughs. Wait! You may also want to watch this movie to see Janet Jackson.
