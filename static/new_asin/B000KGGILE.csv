It seems to be a low-budget movie too. So, rent it if you want. As for me, I regretted buying it.",1173312000,14,260,4.326530612244898

2691172,3,B000KGGILE,"PHOENIX is the third feature by Michael D. Akers as a director and writer (here sharing the credits with Sandon Berg) and as with his other two features 'Matrimonium' and 'Gone, But Not Forgotten' there is a sense that Akers knows how to tell a good story, a story based on universal themes but just happening to be using gay characters to explain a similarity in all manners of love whether they be straight or gay.

LVN Dylan (Chad Bartley) is celebrating his 23rd birthday by setting his apartment with flowers and dinner, expecting his love of one year to arrive for the surprise. The love is Ken (Gaetano Jones) who arrives late and barely notices the setting, giving Dylan a clay vase as a gift and then telling him he must dash off to Phoenix for a failing real estate deal. Dylan is hurt then angry and breaks his gift, sending Ken off to Phoenix in a miff.  Sorry for his behavior Dylan takes the money enclosed in a Birthday card from his folks and flies to Phoenix to apologize to Ken.  But surprises arise in Phoenix: Ken is missing, Dylan traces the broken vase to discover chef/ceramist Demetrius (Jeff Castle) and learns that Ken and Demetrius have been partnered for seven years!  Neither Dylan nor Demetrius is pleased with Ken's lying and cheating but they gradually admit to finding solace with each other and spend time together, including a physical encounter that leads to others as the two prolong Dylan's stay.  How the love triangle is broken but remains influential is the resolution of the story.

Akers has the sensitivity to not make the story have the happy-wappy Hollywood ending: he also has the talent to capture love encounters in a very sensual way.  The actors are all attractive men and given the lack of prior experience each has had, they offer fairly strong performances - especially Chad Bartley.  The film is desperately in need of editing as there are extraneous scenes galore (the landscape scenes are far to brightly sun drenched for the desert locales captured.  But in the end the film is successful in that it does present the joys, trials, and disappointments in love relationships in the gay community that could have easily been in a straight character movie - and that is refreshing!

2691175,4,B000KGGILE,"So your partner frequently travels on business, and you decide to surprise him by showing up at his hotel in Phoenix.  Only the surprise is two-sided.  Not only that, but there is a love twist that surprises even the surprised.  This is not one of those success-driven, happily-ever-after movies, but a realistic look at how life sometimes turns out differently than we expect.  For many, human relationships are much more complex than we realize.  This is a good movie.",1400976000,2,470,4.89873417721519
2691176,5,B000KGGILE,"Phoenix is a movie that it could be one of my favorite of ever if not for a little small detail... The two main characters are beautiful and tender, Dylan is so cute that I almost have always a smile when he was on scene. You can't avoid to heart for him when he again and again prepares his little nest for the soul mates he so desperately is searching. He is soo young and so open to be hurt. Again the movie is a small budget one, the setting is so empty and cold, but really, I believe that Chad Edward Bartley made a very good job with his role. Pity for the end (the small detail I don't like), but probably it's a right end, since Dylan is so young and has still so many road ahead of him.",1278288000,2,696,3.9432624113475176
2691177,4,B000KGGILE,"I really enjoyed this because of the two cute leads, the scenes near my home near Palm Springs, and the gay theme.  The story line could easily happen because of Dylan's age (and his naivete).  But the ending was terrible.

Okay, it didn't need to be a Hollywood ending where everyone lives happily ever after, but that last scene just left me hanging.  I wanted closure.  I didn't get it.  Okay, when Dylan is smiling in the rear view mirror as he's coming back to LA might have been it, but I had to guess that's what this movies' closure looked like.  Did I really have to guess?

Regardless, I gave it 4 stars because it was particularly moving in a few of the touching scenes. The acting by Chad and Jeff was very well done.  Bravo guys, I was able to watch it to the very end and not cringe at 'bad acting' or horrible dialog.",1239321600,,832,4.248407643312102
2691178,3,B000KGGILE,"This is actually a well-done picture, considering it was filmed on a tight budget. I watched Michael Akers' first film, ""Gone, But Not Forgotten."" That film was OK, but the production quality was so poor that the story got lost in the ""cheapie"" look, sound, lighting, and overall feel. ""Phoenix"" has a pleasing look, excellent sound quality, and good background music that actually blends into the film without being invasive. The acting is acceptable, especially by new-comer, Chad Bartley, who shows a surprising range of emotion. This film does not have the cinematic quality ""Get Real"" or ""Latter Days"" has, yet the film is enjoyable and certainly worth watching more than once. Michael Akers is learning his craft and getting better at film making.",1199577600,,753,5.080645161290323

2691180,4,B000KGGILE,"California surfer 23 year old Dylan Wells is in a long-distance relationship with Ken Sparks, who lives in ""Phoenix""(2006).  Dylan is a romantic, and yearns for the day when his boyfriend's work - which involves real estate deals - allows him to move in with him full-time, but tries to make the most out of their times together.

When Ken is called back suddenly to Phoenix, Dylan decides to surprise him and visit him there.  The address he has for him turns out to be a hotel room, but Ken isn't there.  Asking around, Dylan encounters Demetrius, who he later learns has been in a relationship with Ken for seven years.  They learn that Ken has left town, perhaps permanently, following a somewhat shady failed deal.  In consoling each other, they find they have some things in common, and a mutual attraction develops.

A low-budget film, made with inexperienced actors, which nevertheless manages to tell a touching, emotionally-rich story of what love really means to good people.  In the role of Dylan, Chad Bartley shows significant range and emotion as a young gay man already already disillusioned with the games and insincerity that is often a part of the dating experience.  The dialogue is realistic and devoid of simplistic stereotypes, the photography is very good, although the editing could have been sharper.  DVD has no extras other than a couple of trailers and scene selection.  I give this film four stars out of five.",1178496000,9,1440,4.860655737704918

Phoenix is a movie in search of meaning and in search of a story.  In a nutshell, a young (and very cute) man discovers that his lover is leading a double life and has a husband in Phoenix.  After the despicable and poorly-acted lover then disappears, he gets to know ""the other man"" and starts to fall for him.  Big deal.  Most of this movie is him wandering around and/or walking around the house/apartment/hotel in various states of undress.  (These moments are actually some of the highlights.)

I'd completely avoid this movie.  It's a wasted effort for Mr. Akers.  I would have thought he could do better than this, certainly.",1177718400,13,899,5.742424242424242
2691182,5,B000KGGILE,"It is possible to analyze a movie to death. This is not a deep movie. The theme is an ageless and eternal one of love, betrayal of trust and innocence lost. This is not a movie about ""things"". If one played Jackie Wilson's ""To Be Loved"" the moral of this work will become clear. When we draw our last breath, the BMW will not be on our minds, but the arms wrapped around us as we pass from this world.

Chad Bartley as Dylan Wells showed a range of truly believable emotions as he struggled through his young life. One reason for this successful portrayal may be that this persona is what he is really like as a person. While he loved and lost, he gained wisdom for another day. He will be a winner in life. I found the ending upbeat.

Material things in the final analysis really do not matter; they simply make our day-to-day existence more comfortable. What matters is how we treat the people for whom we care. Dylan went to the effort to place an ashtray for his lover, though Dylan was a non-smoker, prepare a special meal, set out candles, etc. These are the acts of a sensitive and caring person. What a treasure it would be to find someone like Dylan (Chad Bartley) who loved you for who you are, not what you can buy. More people should watch this movie and try to internalize its life-affirming message. It really sets forth a basic blueprint for a fulfilling life.",1174521600,8,1375,4.3671875

8156786,3,B000KGGILE,"This movie while not perfect was not half bad either.  The lead actor was so good looking and as good as he looked he could act as well.  He def played the part of a guy who fell in love hard and easily and unsuccessfully. I really like the black and white concept throughout the film as it really worked out well.
The character of Ken who was not really seen so much but was used pretty well here, he was pretty much the jerk of the movie who just seemed so dishonest and shady but still the Dylan character was hooked on him. The Jeff character did not do that much for me here...he seemed all over the place and there were parts of this movie I kept thinking to myself no wonder that  Ken ran out on Jeff... he seemed kind of unbalanced at times.
All in all it was a sweet movie about people unlucky in love and the lengths they go through to hold onto something thats not really there to begin with.",1471564800,4,903,4.090395480225989
