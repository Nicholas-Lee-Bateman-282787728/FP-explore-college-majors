8544461,5,B009V1W9OE,"I watched this film while living in Prague.  It was subtitled in English, so it was easy to follow.  I loved it!  The movie traces the cause and result of the Nazi murders at Lidice.  The film is historically correct, and the acting is good. Particularly the character of the local police chief, who struggles with saving his own life at the sacrifice of his village.  What happened in real life is disturbing, and the movie represents that well.  The ending credits are particularly touching.  I wish I could get this movie on DVD!",1380758400,10,532,4.595744680851064
