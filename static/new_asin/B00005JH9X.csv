1435170,3,B00005JH9X,"When I saw this movie for the first time, it was at the 2000 (?) Chicago Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, where it was premiering for the first time, and I liked it quite a bit.
Yes, just about every character is a catty bed-hopper who spends entirely too much time on looking good and finding the exactly right thing to say in any situation, but can anyone honestly tell me that those kind of people don't exist? Especially in the Castro?
A lot of people who have reviewed this film here have called this a ""Queer as Folk"" knock-off. That's not entirely true. ABout the only thing both shows have in common are the aforementioned catty wit-queens mentioned above. The difference between this and ""QAF"" is that while both present the same stereotypes, ""QAF""--at least in my mind--is even more offensive because it's made by straights who are pandering to what they think the gay community wants to see. It's the equivalent of the ""Mantan"" concept in Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled.""
Somehow, I find it less offensive coming from a gay filmmaker--I'm not sure why, but I do.
I would recommend this movie.",1064016000,13,1094,4.6735751295336785
1435171,3,B00005JH9X,"Very middle of the road gay flick. Cute, kinda funny, but not exactly the expectation nor would I suggest it as a top of the wish list item. But, as a gift it was great and I liked it enough I expect to watch it again.",1044835200,9,218,3.760869565217391
1435172,1,B00005JH9X,"The Gypsy Boys need to get back in the wagon and go back to wherever they came from.
Unrealistic, stupid, poorly acted, cheaply filmed, God where do I end?
Only the cute Cuban boy (Manny?) pulled off a credible performance; and due to this they had him kiss two of the most unattractive men in the American film industry's history! Not to sound superficial, but the men that he was attracted to (the Nazi and the Grandpa) were so unrealistically under his league that you cringe when watching (literally!)
The cheap dream sequences, the really bad jokes, I wish I did not buy this DVD and instead spent the money on envelopes and stamps to write hate-mail to the cast.
Please save your money! No disrespect to Amazon, but don't spend your money on this, they have MANY fantastic films you can buy: go look for them!",1031011200,10,815,4.551020408163265
1435173,1,B00005JH9X,"Wow, this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the actors were mechanical and stale. (read-Boring amatures whose attempts at acting should have never been captured on film)The rest of the movie is too damn cliche...The only appeal to this film is the few male actors who are attractive,but if you were buying this movie for that sole reason, you'd be better off buying an A&F catalouge. Again, I can't stress how crappy this movie is. DON'T BUY IT!",1026518400,5,469,4.529411764705882
1435174,4,B00005JH9X,"Depsite the harsh reviews,  I think this is a pretty good movie.  I suggest you first watch it and then draw your own conclusions.",1024012800,5,130,4.375
1435175,1,B00005JH9X,"Oh my gosh, this movie was BAD!!!!  It was forced in it's acting and empty in it's plot!  I have a LOT of gay movies, and I realize lots of them are made on shoestring budgets, but this movie was A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!",1000080000,15,222,3.911111111111111
1435176,3,B00005JH9X,"All of the characters in this film are young gay males.  One is a highly imaginative sort who ventures - too frequently - into imagining his life in short fantasy vignettes.  Another one, the best-looking, is the resident ""slut"" who is narcissistic and not at all inclined towards settling down with the long suffering artist who loves him and who he partially resides with.  They have an arrangement of openness in their relationship which the artist is growing increasingly dissatisfied with.  In another scenario of interlinking stories, one young Cuban is in love with a bald-headed gent who loves him, but is not in love with him as he is instead in love with the Englishman whom he plans to move to London with.  The unfortunate aspect to this is the English lover is hardly the faithful type, though the center of this romantic triangle doesn't realize this.  Back to the writer's search for his ""knight in shining armor,"" there is a tall, professional model type who is the object of his fantasies, and those fantasies become increasingly lengthy and more and more annoying.  The club scene in the Castro District of San Francisco features brightly in this film as you are dizzyingly introduced to a mutlitude - too many - characters, stereotypes and scenarios.  As with any ensemble cast and multiple plotlines, there are times you want to freeze on one couple, following their story, while instead the film yanks you in a different direction entirely.  The entire story plays out in one weekend, all heavy-socializing from one Friday night to Sunday night.  This movie makes a good companion piece to BROKEN HEARTS CLUB which is also an ensemble with all-gay characters, and also taking place in California, only that group of friends resides in the southern contingent of West Hollywood.",998179200,12,1798,4.923841059602649
7938897,3,B00005JH9X,The movie was quite nice but not really appealling The cast did their best to be funny but not enough kutzpah. Not all of the casts were right for their role.,1469664000,,158,4.129032258064516
7938898,5,B00005JH9X,very good movie. the men are pretty hot in this movie. its sort of like queer as folk in its own way.,1421712000,,101,3.6363636363636362
7938899,4,B00005JH9X,"When watching this you have to remember when this was filmed and what this movie is - an independent film that set the stage for Queer as Folk.  So as a humorous and campy snapshot of San Francisco, it did a great job, it had the mix of laughter and zaniness and yes the common story of searching for love with a great collection of hot boys.  This film a the time had a cult-like following and yes it was because of the cliches.

I think the negative comments I see are because since 1999 this story was the foundation of many great films and TV series done really well.  Since then growth in gay films took off, funding for gay films took off, then came funding from HBO, and the birth of gay networks like Logo.  But if you enjoy stepping-back in time, seeing where gay film started, you are in for a few good giggles and some pretty boys.",1397433600,,842,4.204968944099379
7938900,1,B00005JH9X,"I try not to be overy critical of the artistic endeavors of others. Creative people work hard to express themselves in their respective art forms, and often do so on virtually nonexistent budgets.  This little film is trying to make a statement about the lives and loves of young, attractive gay men. It misses its mark, though, in that the vignettes have no common thead, no plot device to advance the viewer along through the movie.  I've tried twice to get through this low-budget indy, and I simply cannot.  My advice to you, if you're thinking of renting it:  just don't.",1377648000,,576,4.673267326732673
7938901,3,B00005JH9X,This movie lacks a plot line. It is slow and boring. The charactors are funny or amusing.  the preview was deceiving.,1375920000,,117,4.571428571428571
7938902,1,B00005JH9X,"I felt the title was misleading and didn't make a good description for the movie. It had weak plot twists, not to mention the characters scenes didn't transition well from one to the next character. It lacks some level of professionalism, and could it be less drawn out what the theme of the movie was.",1369180800,,302,4.509090909090909
7938903,2,B00005JH9X,"another boring dvd!! why do so many gay movies involve going to a gay bar, drinking, & wondering why a guy can't find Mr. Right? What a boring way to sort out relational problems!",1338768000,,179,4.294117647058823
7938904,1,B00005JH9X,"There is nothing positive I could write about this horrific film. No acting, stupid plot, even more silly dialogues. And ""actors""? They are as hot as ice (unless you are into feminine guys)...
Waste of time and money.",1310342400,,217,4.7368421052631575
7938905,1,B00005JH9X,this movie was a real bomb. tired men with tired one liners that have been said a thousand times.the queens were obnoxious and the others just plain boring.no real plot going on. I've seen alot of gay movies thanks to netflix and this was one of the worst.,1228608000,,256,4.354166666666667
7938906,1,B00005JH9X,"Add this to the pile of navel-gazing ""gay circle of friends"" romantic comedies---it's astounding how many of these get made, as though the same people who make them forget that six or seven of them play the Gay film festivals every year, all following the same template and none much better than the others.  The idea of trying to sit through all of ""Gypsy Boys"" is far funnier than anything actually in the movie---it's hard to decide whether to laugh or die of embarrassment at the stilted dialogue, lame attempts at ""queeny"" humor, dreadful acting, and the unsexiest love scenes ever captured on camera.  Hopefully gay ""filmmakers"" will get over the mindset that throwing what they see as their lives onscreen ---which seems to consist mostly of a small group of friends pursuing the best looking muscle queens at the local bars/clubs---constitutes relevant cinema.  An unfortunate effect of the small-pond mentality of gay cinema perhaps; a small core of mainstream gay audiences lap this stuff up but this sort of tired and unoriginal storytelling wouldn't pass muster for a second in the larger indie film scene.  ""Gypsy Boys"" is a particulary wretched example of this sort of dumbed-down pandering to mainstream gay audiences; but its greatest sin is that even as a stereotypical gay comedy it's too lame to deliver the goods.  You'd do better to watch ""Kiss Me Guido"" again if that's the kind of thing you're looking for.",1142553600,3,1429,4.9375
