8120368,3,B000FBFUPO,I've got it through international shipping. I liked the movie simply because it has fenn in it. The flow of events is a bit exagerating especially how casper the actor kept killing everyone although he's a cop and no one bothered to stop him except for Fenn...very odd to me!! Hope you enjoy the movie,1415750400,,301,4.490909090909091
8120369,1,B000FBFUPO,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!  There are several inconsistencies with various scenes and the plot itself.  I'm glad I didn't pay any money to watch this movie.  Here are some examples:  1)  The female detective is being chased by other police cars because of her wreckless driving - she never shows her badge or calls on her radio.  2) she wrecks while being chased and ends up in the hospital, she yells at her corrupt partner and tells him to get out.  Next thing you see is her calmly listening to him explain his decisions...  3) She shoots the father of the bad cop, double-tap to the center of his chest.  He come around long enough to shoot the bad cop surprisingly enough - but wait - he is then shown to have survived the shooting and is in jail.  He takes two to the chest and survives but it only takes one bullet to kill his son...  I would never recommend that anyone suffer through this movie!!",1409961600,,930,4.287356321839081

8120371,1,B000FBFUPO,"Sherilyn Fenn (Twin Peaks, Boxing Helena) stars as Kathryn Shaunessy in this painful unsuspenseful action/thriller about some LAPD corrupt cops and a killer played by Casper Van Dien (Slayer, Starship Troopers) who is taking out drug dealers one by one. Soon Fenn finds out whats going on and her husband and baby might be in danger. Could her partner played by Jerry Kroll (Second to Die, Starkweather) be in on it too? Well if you're very interested in it take a look but it's pretty formulaic with cringe worthy dialouge and bad acting. The action even isn't that good. Fenn is wasted big time here. Van Dien isn't a convincing bad guy. Also starring Larry Drake (Dr. Giggles, Darkman), Ted Shackelford (Knots Landing, Cave In), Jordan Roberts (Butch Camp, Passions) & Richard Gleason (Good Friday, 10 Tricks). The movie is also called Officer Down",1155600000,3,851,4.916666666666667
