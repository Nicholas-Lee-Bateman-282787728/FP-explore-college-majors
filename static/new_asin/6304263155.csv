7866163,5,6304263155,"Nice video of the history of gun development from early formation of hand cannons, black powder, then wheel lock, fintlock, percussion, upi to modern guns.  Since I had it on vhs, this dvd copy is much more clearer.  Recommended",1470787200,,228,4.82051282051282
7866164,5,6304263155,"Already made one review on this one. I personally feel this is the best of all gun documentaries that I have ever seen. To bad A&E didn't have the foresight to put it on dvd.  Love it's history on what is presented. A couple of key point though: other documentaries give credit of gun powder to the Chinese because of early fireworks. These guys don't know and give credit to Roger Bacon. My favorite of all is that they couldn't figure out how the lock stock and barrel came together. Some experts, I figured it out all by myself. The lock and the stock came from a crossbow, and the hand held cannon or barrel was simply mounted to it and refined throught the years! Was a great deal for the price and I am glad I finally broke down and bought it. Thanks",1402272000,,756,4.25
7866165,5,6304263155,"This is a great TV show, that comes in a set of four tapes, that documents the vast history of the firearm... from conception of black powder to the invention of the modern firearm, this program documents it all, in an entertaining and historical way. This is the greatest gun series of all time!!! If you're a fan of firearms or want to learn more about them, this series is an excellent and entertaining way to go about that... It isn't a reality show, like ""Sons of Guns"" or ""American Guns"", but rather an actual educational program, about the history of firearms.",1397779200,,567,4.568627450980392

7866167,3,6304263155,"When this was presented on TV, I taped the complete series (commercials and all).
  When the DVD came out (I wanted better quality and no commercials).  I got my wish ( with the exception) that only the first two episodes are there.
  The quality of the video and sound is excellent.  I only wish the indicated that this was only the first two episodes and the others will follow or something.",1360108800,,393,4.464788732394366

7866170,5,6304263155,"Most people have very strong feelings one way or the other about guns.

This is a 4-VHS tape series on the history of weapons, specifically guns.

It takes viewers all the way back in time to man's desire to extend the reach of his arm.

Something very typical of this history of guns is the comment by Oliver Winchester, that a gun is essentially little more than ""a machine for throwing balls.""  Most of us have never thought of it that way, as the media have attached quite a bit of ""baggage"" to every report about guns.

We have also never been given the opportunity to discover the freedom which guns have brought to the world.  Huh?--how is that possible?  Before the invention of guns, feudal lords could tyrannize the masses by employing a relative handful of knights, highly skilled bowmen, and castle strongholds.  Upon the invention of firearms, even the common folk could use a firearm against a feudal lord's hired thugs, and cannons could bring down the castle walls that previously had allowed feudalism to flourish.

What we have here is a straightforward, historical story of the evolution of guns from simple beginnings hundreds of years ago, to the remarkable machines of today which feature incredible accuracy and durability.

There is good, crisp photography of some beautiful collectible guns, and of famous people in the history of gun lore.  Even for those who never have any intention of even holding a gun, this is a presentation of information they should know, and may be surprised to find they enjoy!",1172275200,3,1530,4.823754789272031
