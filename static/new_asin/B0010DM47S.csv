8237714,5,B0010DM47S,"I heard about this series from a friend at [...] and I was skeptical about it at first. When I started watching it, I thought the over the top action was a parody. But it wasn't as I soon found out, and I realized how epic the series is.

27 episodes later, it far surpassed my favorite anime series and will forever hold a place in my heart.",1222732800,,342,4.029411764705882
8237715,5,B0010DM47S,"This is probably the best series I have ever seen and pre-ordered this in december. The problem is, ADV is having issues so don't expect to see this title at your doorstep anytime soon. They haven't been giving out much information so it makes us wonder, will it ever come out?",1206316800,,277,4.450980392156863
8237716,5,B0010DM47S,"This is not an anime for anyone who thinks anime should be stern, serious and deep.  Gainax has outdone themselves this time; Gurren Lagann has all the wild creativity, fanservice, humor and passion that has distinguished this animation house, except this time they've turned it all up to eleven.  The elements are familiar enough: spirited shounen goggle-boy, gorgeous bikini-clad girl with gun, post-apocalyptic world where humans live underground in fear, giant robots, et cetera.  Gainax even retraces the themes of some of their own previous releases, and pays blatant homage to a number of prior anime.  Yet somehow all these elements form an unpredictable series that rarely lets up.  Certainly not everything makes sense in Gurren Lagann, but it doesn't have to; the ferocity of the characters is enough to enthrall and captivate.  The animation (with the forgivable exception of Episode 4) is top-notch as well.  This is completely worth seeing.",1204070400,4,954,5.2781456953642385
8237717,5,B0010DM47S,"even though this series is ...... i can't even think of a word for this series i watched it last year with some friends when he had to search for independently subtitled copies and all i can think is the sword that keeps going in either episode 2 or 3 and don't believe in yourself, believe in me who believes in you!

i would definitely suggest to everyone to at least check this one out",1203984000,4,388,4.173333333333333
8237718,5,B0010DM47S,"It's a phrase that you will hear quite often in Gainax's latest television series. You probably remember them as the creators of Nadia, Otaku No Video, Gunbuster, FLCL, and Evangelion. Their new series is all about kicking reason to the curb....literally. Take everything that you loved about giant robot shows like Getter Robo, Voltron, Gundam, or Macross and multiply it by a thousand.....no make it a million. The cast of characters are instantly memorable after a few episode and animation is spectacular throughout the entire series. The story keeps progressing forward at a quick pace with action in nearly EVERY episode. It doesn't take itself too seriously and after watching it you'll know why it's one of the greatest anime series' of this decade.",1203897600,9,757,5.112903225806452
8237719,5,B0010DM47S,"Anime DVD's can be incredibly expensive, compared to movies and domestic TV shows. However, I think the first three episodes of Gurren Lagann, 75 minutes in length, meets and succeeds the levels of raw entertainment in your average Hollywood action film, as well as paving the way to a truely heartfully-told, unique story.

Episode 4 is a terrible, steaming wreck that essentially got one of the companies co-founders fired. But it can just be skipped...head straight to episode 5.",1201651200,8,482,5.10126582278481
8237720,5,B0010DM47S,"...for I will review this before the R1 is out! Well, I did review the first official sub over at Anime News Network, so this is somewhat legitimate. Like with R. Cumbee, believe in me who believes in the review, which will say this is THE series to see of 2007 (and buy in 2008 =) ).

GAINAX has pulled an amazing rabbit trick out of its hat with this original series. As an action series, not one episode goes by without one explosive event involving Gunmen (as what the mechas are called in the series). The story does not fall off the wayside because it, but instead advances beyond what is possible because of the main characters' very actions.

Simon, the central character throughout the series, shows gradual and distinctive development as the plot unfolds. Using this analogy, he is like Naota from FLCL, but instead of watching Haruka leave, he goes with her to further himself (as savior of the universe).

Animation quality is excellent, higher than most works for a series of 27 episodes. It follows a stylized artwork like with FLCL, less like NGE. Though this is just for Volume 1, the rest of the series will not disappoint.

I have not heard the English dub versions, though the voice actors are familiar. Tiffany Grant, who voices Yoko, is best known for her voicing of Asuka Langley Soryu, and Brett Weaver, who voices Kamina, voiced Toji Suzuhara from NGE. Josh Grelle voices Simon, but I have not heard him in the series he has voiced.

Just how is this series not on TV???",1200873600,4,1494,4.580524344569288
8237721,5,B0010DM47S,"I am not gonna lie to you.... This Anime is stupid and ridiculous. And its probably the best anime I have seen in a very long time. The story is about a boy who finds a tiny little green drill thing and he uses this to pilot a  small and funny looking face mecca. The story does take some very interesting turns and will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next Vol.

I do have to say that this Anime has a vary good pacing, meaning that things move somewhat fast and you won't find yourself listening to countless episodes dialog over the same stuff.

And if you don't believe in this review believe in me who believes in this review. XD",1200355200,20,652,4.118110236220472
