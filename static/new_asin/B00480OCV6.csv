8418462,5,B00480OCV6,"While the film is called Mr. Wu, it is actually about a powerful Mandarin and the love, deep love, he has for his daughter and his Chinese traditions and code. Lon Chaney is excellent in the film. He plays Mr. Wu (the Mandarin) and Mr. Wu's grandfather (the former Mandarin). The film is sad. It is a 1927 black and white silent film that lasts 106 minutes. Despite it being silent, it is very easy to follow and enjoy.
The grandfather arranges a marriage for his grandson when he was just a boy, and the grandson enjoys and loves his wife even though he did not see her before his marriage. Unfortunately, she dies giving her husband a daughter, which, as I said, he loves dearly, and wants to arrange a marriage for her as well. She also loves her father very much. When the grandfather dies, the grandson becomes the Mandarin.
Despite his plans, the daughter falls in love with an Englishman and has sex with him. This is a violation of Chinese law which demands that in such a case, the father must kill the daughter, otherwise she will suffer in the next world.
The Mandarin decides to take revenge upon the Englishman who seduced his daughter and the Englishman's family.",1501977600,,1177,4.530516431924883

8418467,1,B00480OCV6,"I have been a fan of Lon Chaney Sr most of my life and so am happy these films are finally being made available. This script is pretty dated and some may see the portrayal of some of the Chinese characters as offensive but Chaney does his with strength and sensitivity.

The problem is that Warner Archives gave absolutely no thought to the the soundtrack for this DVD. These film had scores composed for them yet Warners just plays anything. This score is especially bad. It has nothing to do with the film at any point and makes no sense whatsoever even as music. Just stuff thrown together, often times being shrill and hard on the ears. This so-called ""composer"" is so inept I wonder if she's a child with no training. Sounds like it. Definitely not a musician in any sense of the word. Warner Archive should withdraw this until they find a listenable soundtrack.

Of course, the film is worth seeing for Chaney but the unlistenablely bad soundtrack pretty much negates Chaney's efforts. Wait for Warners to reissue it properly.",1289433600,17,1032,4.664835164835165
