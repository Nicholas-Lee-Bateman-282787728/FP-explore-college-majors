Jeremy Pivens does a remarkable job of describing the all too-typical college lifestyle.  To add to his antics, put David Spade right smack in the middle.  The movie reflects a satirical look at stereotypes on most American college campuses and a commentary on how secular we've become.  The story centers on one kid who is visiting PCU (Port Chester University) for the weekend.  They refer to him as a ""pre-frosh.""  He winds up getting himself in a mix of trouble and relies on the PCU gang to bail him out.  This movie comes highly recommended to any college student or movie lover around.

Period.

Yes, I've seen Animal House.

PCU is a wonderful satire of how stupid being overly politically correct is and how it's a huge negative for the value of colleges in America.

589766,4,6303165737,"The movie has a pretty star studded cast.  Jeremy Piven (Entourage, Rush Hour 2, Smokin' Aces, Cars), Jon Favreau (Swingers, Iron Man, I Love You Man), David Spade (Tommy Boy, SNL, Rules of Engagement), Jessica Walter (Mother in Arrested Development) and Alex Dsert (Swingers, Becker).

The movie is a tight 90 minutes about a Senior in High School (Tom Lawrence, played by Chris Young) who is visiting PCU (Port Chester University) for the day, because he is interested in attending.  Piven's character is signed up, as a prank, by a friend (Alex Dsert) to show around ""the pre-frosh""(Tom) the School.  Piven is in a frat that is dwindling in numbers and has a bad rep.  The school, according to many of the characters, is drowning from being politically correct.  Piven, Young and Dsert cause some trouble and need to get some money to bail them selves out.

The movie is the story of how they do it, things that stop them and has many different good themes, that if I tell you may give away too much of the plot.

The movie is well written, has a lot of heart and has you understanding who the characters are without much explanation.  The movie is from 1994 and it shows, but doesn't take much away from it.  In the end, what you have is a funny, entertaining movie worth watching.  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Piven or quirky, off beat comedies like Eurotrip.",1312416000,,1380,4.591836734693878

589768,5,6303165737,"I first saw this movie on HBO in summer 1995.  I didn't remember it ever having been in theaters, but the tagline on Prevue Network was ""an Animal House for the 90's"" and I love Animal House, so I decided to give it a try.  I found it to be even better than Animal House, due to being more relevant to the times, plus just a good movie all-around.  Very little bad language, no sexual situations, and a fun, lighthearted message about going against the flow and being yourself.  Modern college movies could, and should, take notes.  THIS is how you make a comedy.

Jeremy Piven is at his best in this movie as the slacker leader of a bunch of college misfits.  The story centers around a 'pre-frosh' that visits the PCU campus and has his ideas and expectations of what college life will be shattered during one crazy weekend in the 'Pit'.

589818,4,6303165737,"A little of Jeremy goes a long way, but I know plenty of people love him, and now that he has attained mass popularity playing the agent in ENTOURAGE on HBO, his new fans who are looking back for earlier traces of his brilliance should come here first.  This is the movie that should have catapulted him into stardom, and on the DVD track a sulky, offhand Jeremy Piven reveals some of the frustration he must have felt when as it happened, the movie died a terrible death during its very first weekend at the box office and nearly ended the careers of all concerned.

Piven is always complaining about poor Hart Bochner and how he felt stifled by Bochner's conservative direction and his insistence on sticking to the script.  You'd think Jeremy was some kind of Robert Altman/John Cassavetes veteran the way he swears by improvising your lines even when you've got a really good script.  Of course he had a very good bit in Altman's THE PLAYER.  Directors are drawn to his ability to play a selfish, self-absorbed heel.  On the DVD commentary he comes across as supremely bored with everything, including his own performance.

Everyone who hates being PC will find their egos massaged by this light-hearted, and really very conservative movie which is really only for college students and those who remember being on the odds with the PC culture while they were in college.  If you didn't go to college you won't find it half as funny as those who have.  Add a point if you're drunk or high.",1121817600,2,1492,4.621212121212121

The story is based around Chris Young who plays a pre-frosh visting Westchester college to see if he wants to go there. He finds himself engulfed in a student body that is overrun with hypocrtical political agendas and student protests. Jermey Piven unexpectedly becomes his tour guide as they fall into various adventures including throwing meat at a vegan protest, trashing a bmw, getting evicted from their house, and having Geroge Clinton play for an all campus party. David Spade plays the preppy overachever that becomes Piven's nemesis as he attempts to get him kicked out of school.

It has something in it, maybe the memorable cast and the eccentric storyline, that just has everyone wanting to watch it again and again and again. It's like 'Dazed and Confused', just no Richard Linklater. But anyway, this film is a classic and a much better college classic than say, Van Wilder...although I do enjoy that, as well.

Pivitz and Favreu are a great working team. It's only a surprise Favreu doesn't use him a lot in his films, because here, they work. Although Favreu isn't the main character, he still takes the scene always. Need I mention David Spade, in his ego driven, highly right wing, conservative college student role? The characters are memorable to say the least.

The story is simple. Lame kid come to college. College crazy. Kid see crazy. Kid conquer crazy. Lame kid equal cool kid. It's simple, but the side stories, the soundtrack(funk and rock), and the time period where politically correct was bound for a long road...all just flow well.

PCU isn't a classic comedy. It's a classic cult comedy and because of that, it receives special treatment. I just wonder why most cult comedies receivesuch minimal DVD treatment, although this fairs better than Wayne's World, Tommy Boy, Billy Madison.

I'd buy it and for that price, you can't beat it. It's usually 10 bucks too.",1090368000,3,1365,4.82051282051282
589872,3,6303165737,"PCU is a 90's version of Animal House.  Set at the fictional Port Chester University in Connecticut, the film centers around a fun loving fraternity who faces eviction from their frat house unless they come up with $7,500. for damages.  Much like Animal House, a smarmy, white-bred priss teams with the dean to help aid in their ousting.  The campus is overrun with political correctness from Womanysts, Afrocentrics, gay groups, stoners and others.  The plotlines are predictable, but the cast lead by the extremely underrated Jeremy Piven, rise above the clichs to create an extremely enjoyable film.  Mr. Piven stars as Droz, the leader of the group and he plans a blow out party at the house's main room, The Pit.  His cohorts include Alex Desert as Muls, his smooth talking best friend, a young Jon Favreau (with a bizarre dreadlock hairdo) as the stoner Gutter, Megan Ward as the freshman Katy and Chris Young as a pre-freshman up for weekend to see if he wants to attend the school and who ends up ticking off almost the entire campus.  They are pitted against the Dean Garcia-Thompson played with icy bluster by Jessica Walter and Rand McPherson played with unctuous smarm by David Spade.  Through a series of mishaps, it looks like the party is going to be a bust.  Then through a minor set of miracles, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic show up and play the party and they gather enough cash to pay the damages.  It is still not enough to save them.  In another Animal House parallel, the frat disrupts the school's Bicentennial celebration and ends up saving the house by getting the dean fired.  PCU has TV movie like running time of barely one hour and twenty minutes, but its brevity helps keep the frantic pace up and it doesn't get bogged down in extraneous plotlines.",1088726400,2,1791,4.760517799352751

Anywho, this is a great college film that seperates itself from the rest in its genre (except a few such as Animal House or Road Trip). It has a descent cast, including Jeremy Piven and David Spade. It is quite funny and has many memorable parts, while keeping in mind the important topic of political correctness. I'm not saying the movie is politically correct, it's far from it, but it makes you think twice about it.

""Stop Protesting"" should be the mantra for this new century.  PC, unfortunately, will never die but this movie went a long way to delegitimizing it.  I had a laugh when I saw that this was rated #12 for Michigan universities--it would have to be based on my memories of visiting my friend's at Michigan.

Then, during my own occasionally bizarre collegiate experience, I found one such *real* department at a (to remain unnamed) school in California. I @#$% you not, folks. PCU is a very, very funny movie, and in the years since its release it is proving to have been movie that was, astonishingly, well ahead of its time. If you went to college in or after the late '90s, you will recognize every caricature the movie presents, and even if you didn't you can see them all, increasingly, at large in society today. Don't get carried away, it's not an especially deep or insightful comedy, but it presents the obvious in a way impossible to not find hilarious and it may even surprise you occasionally when you look around and see how little they really had to exaggerate to make it happen. Plus, it has George Clinton in it...how much more does a movie really need before you can call it a latter-day classic?",1071532800,2,1223,4.746478873239437

589911,4,6303165737,"I'll make my point upfront:  This was a great movie (one of my personal favorites), and purchasing the DVD is worth every penny spent for Hart Bochner's commentary alone.
Now for the reasons behind my opinion:  Let me premise this review by saying that I watched PCU on cable not too long ago, so I skipped straight to the Bonus features upon getting the DVD home.  I wasn't very impressed with the Mud Honey video or the Behind-the-scenes featurette, but seeing the trailer (for the first time ever) was cool and the fact that I had TWO separate commentaries to choose from was very promising.  HOWEVER, being a Jeremy Piven fan, I started with his commentary, which is actually second on the list of bonus features and not necessarily a logical place to start the show.  I was sorely disappointed by Piven's whiney repetitive rant about how the actors were denied creative license & not allowed to improvise.  He spent half the movie complaining about the director (not very professional).  The other 50% was pretty evenly split between him mentioning that he came down with Malaria and just letting the movie play because he couldn't think of anything else to say.  I felt like he hadn't watched the movie since it's release a decade ago and didn't bother to prepare for his stint as commentator.
I then turned to Hart Bochner's commentary, figuring that he would have comparable complaints to those of Piven.  I was surprised to find that he seems to be under the exact opposite impression - namely that he actively gave the cast creative license.  He did have some complaints of his own though... namely that HE was not allowed to have creative license due to being contractually bound by the studio to deliver a PG-13 movie, whereas his vision of PCU would have been R (language, visual, drug use, etc).  He makes several references to scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor (most notably the Jerrytown scene, which is apparently completely different than the original version), which would have made an excellent addition to the Bonus Features section.  Other interesting info served up by Bochner include the other actors considered for certain roles.  I found Bochner's commentary to be the most entertaining and educational commentary I have ever watched.
If you buy this DVD for one reason, buy it because PCU is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  If you buy it for two reasons, make sure you watch Bochner's commentary.  You'll gain a new appreciation of an old favorite.",1063324800,5,2487,4.8325471698113205
589912,5,6303165737,"You can read my movie review below; this is for the DVD extras.  (By the way, my reference in my first review to Hart Bochner as Ellis is from the first _Die Hard_ movie, in case you couldn't guess.)
The extra features are:
- The disc has a Fullscreen edition on the front and Widescreen on the back.
- Commentary by director Hart Bochner
- Separate commentary by Jeremy Piven
- Featurette
- Mudhoney ""Pump It Up"" video
- Original trailer
I didn't find the featurette or the video too thrilling.  Hart Bochner's commentary was dry, but occasinally had informative nuggets.  When I saw PCU in the theater, I remember being a little disappointed that it seemed to be more of a ""party"" movie rather than really skewering the PCU movement, which should have been its focus in my opinion.  Hart Bochner basically says the same thing...he was contractually forced to deliver a PG-13 rating, and feels a more edgy, R-rated movie would have better suited the material.  It would have been nice to see some of the scenes that were cut to avoid the ""R"" (like half the Jerrytown scene.)
Jeremy Piven's commentary was a little bit of a letdown, because he spends something like half of it complaining that the actors didn't get to do improvisation with the script during shooting.  Really gets annoying the third or fourth time he brings it up
But hey, the extras are all free on the disc, so I can't complain too much.  Enjoy this great movie!",1062979200,,1432,4.592156862745098
589913,4,6303165737,"When you're in school you find that a movie or two becomes a reference point for your life.  You watch it with your boys after you get home from a bar, you see parts of the plot in your everyday life, you give people you know nicknames from the movie, you pull the quotes out for no reason to crack people up, and you wear out the vhs tape to the point that you need a new one.
For me, PCU is that movie.  Buying this DVD will be my third purchase of this movie.  That has to say something.
Just some highlights:
Piven jumping on Spade (while asleep in bed) in thier freshman year with a woman and a bottle of vodka screaming ""GO BACK TO SLEEP""
A stoned Favreau interpreting ""Can you show me where the campus is?"" as ""Can you blow me where the pampers is?""

Jeremy Piven leads a cast of semi-normal college students in a sea of caricatures in this movie.  He does all the stuff we wish we could do against all the people we wish we could do it to--the overly sensitive, ""cravenly PC"" crowd.  Normally, his cookie-cutter adversaries would make for boring subject matter, but after spending my time at college, I've seen that there really are people out there that are this bizarre.  Piven really carries this movie, and Jon Favreau is also pretty good as Gutter.  The potheads are hilarious, as are the Womynists.  David Spade's character and his organization are also pretty good.  The one thing that you'll begin to notice if you've been on a college campus lately, is that you'll see a character in this movie, and realize that you know someone like that or have seen something similar.

589919,4,6303165737,"I saw this in theaters, and although I felt at the time that it didn't measure up to similar films (Animal House), it grew on me.  It does an excellent job of poking fun at the whole PC craze that was sweeping college campuses in the early to mid 90's...it was so bad, anything you said could be misconstrued, and any attempt to have fun was frowned upon.  This movie made me a huge fan of Jeremy Piven (although, after this movie, I can't believe he's the DEAN in _Old School_!)  My favorite moment was when the group wonders what happened to Gutter (Jon Favreau)...one character says he's probably in a parking lot picking his nose somewhere.  Cut to Gutter in a long shot, under a parking lot street lamp.  He looks down at his finger, then makes a flicking motion... his nose-picking is only implied, never seen.

589920,5,6303165737,"This movie is so funny I seriously watch it about once a week. The members of 'the pit' are the anti-fraternity on campus, who don't care about be being politically correct (like everyone else on campus is obsessed with). When they are in danger of being kicked out of their house, they decide to have a fundraiser in the form of a party. It succeeds in bringing all the students together (with some help from George Clinton), but the president of the university still shuts them down. They decide to get rid of her by wrecking the school's bicentennial celebration. There are a few other storylines going on at the same time - Droz and his old girlfriend hooking up again; the pre-frosh making enemies with everyone on campus and the stoners. There are lots of great pranks and physical comedy. Jeremy Piven is great as the college-student-for-life James 'Droz' Andrews and David Spade as the elitist leader of underground frat Balls and Shaft provides some of the funniest moments.

589963,5,6303165737,"One of the traditions displayed every decade in film tends to be of the college flick.  However, these have become abundantly rare.  Having been in the shadow of the likes of such movies as Porky's and National Lampoon's Animal House, PCU finds itself stuck in the midst of a competitive market.  I do believe this movie does manage to hold its own with the portrayal of how college life really is (in most cases).  With the perfect mix of stoner humor and a reasonable plot, PCU comes to life as Piven's character Droz comes to terms with his former love, his enemies, as well as his friends.  Chocked full of hi-jinx, this college movie starring Jeremy Piven (Family Man, Very Bad Things), John Favreau (Very Bad Things, The Replacements, Made), and sarcastic funny-man David Spade (Lost and Found, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep) with a very special appearance of the funk master himself, George Clinton, you just might find yourself liking it at PCU.

589964,4,6303165737,"I caught this movie on video not long after it took a dive in theatres in 1994 and had no expectations for it. I was surprised how much I loved it and after half-a-dozen viewings it still holds up as one of the top ""kollege skool daze"" films of all-time. A sort of 1990s take on ""Animal House"" but adjusted to reflect the smothering, neutering, pandering effect that political correctness has had on society, and college society in particular, ""PCU"" is the story of a hapless perspective freshman (""prefresh"") who visits the fictional Port Charles University, once a happening party school that has been spayed by its obsessively PC dean. The prefresh finds himself in the middle of a war being waged between the Order of Balls & Shaft (a button-down clan of elitist snobs led by super-smarmy David Spade) and a group of renegade misfits led by Droz (Jeremy Piven at his very best) over ownership of ""the Pit"" -- the decaying fraternity house occupied by Droz's band but which once housed Spade's Hitler Youth troop. The real battle on campus, however, is between those who just want to party and have a good time and various sterotypical groups (militant blacks, feminazis, potheads, vegans, gays, etc) who have made any behavior that doesn't involve protesting basically impossible. The president of the university, Garcia-Thomas (note the hyphen), so hates the ""offensive"" Pit-persons that she sides with Spade's group to drive them off campus even though Spade is the antithesis of all of her beliefs. What follows is general chaos, with a hilarious performance by John Favereau (fat and wearing dreadlocks) as Gutter, a moron who fails every task given to him yet somehow gets George Clinton and his P-Funk All Stars to jam at a ""Save the Pit"" fundraiser. ""PCU"" is hardly a perfect movie, but having had an extremely crazy college career I could definetly relate to what happens in the film, and I most definetly give a ""big up"" (as they say in Jamaica) to the brutally anti-PC message. Simply put, I laughed my butt off at this film.
