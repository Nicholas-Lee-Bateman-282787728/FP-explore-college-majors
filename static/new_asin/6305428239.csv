1019636,2,6305428239,"why so small a picture? i'm not a huge fan of widescreen's diminished image-size on what-used-to-be-normal monitors.....but this letter-boxed size gives you even less image than that. i didn't pull out the ruler to measure  but basically the image takes up maybe 50% of the screen...ridiculous...a true rip if you ask me.
and it's not like it's a $5 movie either....so if you like your wes anderson the way i do....big and poetic and vibrant and colorful...be forewarned here.

1020698,5,6305428239,"I will freely admit that this movie irritates a lot of people, as it should. I knew a kid in high school who was just like Max, the film's protagonist. Someone who was touched by some divine hand, one that allowed him to be himself in all circumstances, to thumb his nose at the authorities and to come out better for it. He was fearless, driven, absurd, relentless and, like Max, somehow irresistible. That, for me, is what Wes Anderson captures best in this film -- Max's allure. You likely hate him. You hardly love him, sometimes sympathize with him, often resent him, but you can't, under any circumstances, ignore him -- just as Herman Blume, Rosemary Cross and poor old Dr. Guggenheim can't.

Jason Schwartzman's first major movie role could not have been better suited to him; indeed, he has reprised this archetype in numerous later roles. The oddly perspicacious, oddly above-it-all little go-getter who may not always ""succeed"", but by God he does try. Mr. Failbetter himself.

Even if you love Rushmore, you've got to be in a certain type of mood to watch and appreciate it -- somewhere between frumpy and wistful, perhaps after a bout of deep creativity or 2 depressing weeks of project management b****hit.

I sometimes like to picture what Max Fischer has done with his life since we last saw him in 1998. Wouldn't it be great to have a Rushmore 2? Max at 35. I picture him as a big shot Hollywood director whose latest film tanked, sending him into a spiraling depression. We open on Herman Blume smoking a cigarette on the veranda of some derelict colonial mansion, overlooking the Indian Ocean. The air is hot and humid. It's nearing dusk. Blume is clearly uncomfortable. He's traveled two days to get to Fischer, who's hiding out at this mansion on the remote French island outpost of Reunion.

Max's life at the mansion is no picnic: a resentful, hot wife who's beginning to think she could have done better and is considering trading Max in while she's still young enough to snag a billionaire; twin boys who have ADHD and insist on speaking French, an affectation Max can't stand; the mansion's staff are in quiet revolt, and the gardener makes menacing motions with the tree clippers while Max, in his bathrobe, stares absentmindedly out at the ocean, sipping his morning Turkish coffee on the balcony.

Blume proposes they go on an adventure.

Hijinks ensue.

Margaret Yang redeems Max in the end, just as she did the first time.",1406678400,,2453,4.744131455399061

1020700,5,6305428239,"Rushmore was great!  It seemed like the characterization was the most important element in this movie.  The story was a bit bizarre. We were waiting for the characters to do something extreme and from the way things unfolded, we weren't sure where the characters were being led or how extreme their actions might be.  It was kind of a twisted, coming-of-age, romantic comedy.  The music was fantastically chosen perfect for each scene.  Once again, we are Wes Anderson fans!",1406073600,,474,4.949367088607595

The others were decent, though not terribly likeable. It came off as an odd combination of John Hughes' Ferris Bueller and the Coen Brother's A Serious Man.

But that's only the framework for a fascinating look at this young misfit who is nevertheless deeply engaged in his school, Rushmore, as an awkward leader who seems to be wearing two left shoes at all times. You still love him, as he bumbles through clumsy efforts to win the kindergarten teacher's heart. Bill Murray plays a grumpy divorcee who captures some of those same traits, giving us a movie with foil.

Holding the movie together, in a certain sense, is the warm and touching performance of Seymour Cassel as the father of Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman. Made all the more poignant, BTW, by the news of his very recent passing (Seymour Cassel, not Jason Schwartzman). Wonderful, touching, hilarious movie.",1396051200,,519,4.777777777777778

Then I saw ""Rushmore"" and my whole perspective changed. Wes Anderson perfectly captures the feeling of a teenager and the pressures that surround while also adding originality to the plot and characters. Jason Schwartzman perfectly portrays an  extra-curricular addicted teen who has a love-hate relationship with the audience and characters alike and is to mature for his own good as seen when he continually surprises the wonderfully played supporting actors Bill Murray and Olivia Williams. The kids are played spot on and the plot keeps you interested the entire time.

1021030,5,6305428239,"I was 15 when I first saw this film. I was coming to the end of an odd emotional whirlwind, and my first year of crazy, irrational high school was almost over. A teacher I met in the first semester, an English teacher for whom I'd had a slight innocent crush on was now working at the local video store(I think she was the manager, but I cant be certain), anyway, she was only a student teacher, so she left after the first semester was up, and I missed her a lot, then I found that she worked at the video store, every Sunday I'd grab my movies, turn them in and rent three more, all because I could see her and talk to her about movies, video games, comics, books, anything. I'd heard of Rushmore many time through the internet, magazines, and other things, I'd seen Bottle Rocket(Wes Anderson's first and equally great film)and The Darjeeling Limited already, but it was Rushmore. I found it on the shelf, and rented it. I brought it home and probably watched it that night or the next. From the first scene on, I was entranced.
  Max Fischer(played to perfection by Jason Schwartzman)reminded me so much of myself, not only in his odd tastes, his somewhat mean-mannered behavior, his flaws, his everything, really. Max first meets Miss Cross after reading a passage she wrote into a book about the sea, a quote from Jacques Cousteau, he falls in love with her almost immediately. And through his naive encounters and constant strains to try and convince her she is the one for him, and he the one for her, he only manages to push her away, and lose what he wanted most. And through this, we see Max grow up, and become more mature. To me, the film was almost a mirror of what I was feeling at the time, depressed, angry, ""in love"", etc. it showed me something new, hope. And for the first time in a film it didn't seem cheap or trite, or whatever, it felt real, to me at least, and my own twisted up world view, but that doesn't matter. I never ever went to the extremes Max did, in fact, I never acted on my attractions what so ever, but I felt a kind of... I dunno soulful connection between Max and myself, for better or worse, he almost is exactly like me. Yes, I know this wasn't the ""average"" review, but I wanted to say WHY this film is so important to me, and why, after seeing it about ten times since, and about a year and half since I FIRST saw it, it still packs an emotional punch at the end when the curtains are drawn. This film isn't for everyone, so everyone shouldn't necessarily go see it. It's classic Wes Anderson dry, dead-pan humor, if you don't get it, you probably never will. The film is a lot like Harold and Maude and even the Graduate, but still functions solely in and of itself. This film isn't guaranteed to effect most people in the same way it did me, because most people don't have that first hand experience with what the film more or less deals with, and also in an innocent way, not like in a dark foreign art house film that'd make the thing into a very dark and disturbing endeavor, here, to me and my experiences, Rushmore couldn't BE anymore realistic. This is most definitely in my top ten favorite films, but probably only because of my experiences, check it out if you think you'll like it, it will certainly be worth it.
  I have grown to love Wes Anderson and his films, all somewhat surrealistic, and more than obviously inspired by both New Hollywood films of the sixties and also the artistic and cinematography of French New Wave films like Breathless, Pierot Le Fou and Jules et Jim(referenced slightly in the Life Aquatic, ""Not This One.""). I decided to keep this review personal, and completely non-objective, because, well, I cant be objective with this film, its too near and dear to me to do that, so yes, I am biased, but please, be biased with me? :)",1310515200,5,3813,4.396600566572238
1021031,5,6305428239,"`Rushmore' is classic Wes Anderson and offers up a dry, humorous storyline with enough depth to elevate it above a mere comedy.

Max Fischer goes to Rushmore Private Academy and despite his poor grades he throws himself into school life with full vigour.  He is president and founder of numerous school clubs, mentors a younger pupil and talks with airs and graces not normally becoming a fifteen year student.  He also works at seducing a young teacher who works at the school and who he falls deeply in love with.  He befriends another pupils father (played by Murray) and when he too falls for the teacher things start to go awry.

This has Anderson's quirky touch throughout and whilst a lot of the lines are delivered dead pan and this isn't an out and out comedy, I found myself laughing for much of the film.  Jason Schwartzman is simply excellent in this film and his delivery of numerous lines borders on perfection.  Bill Murray is as superb as we have come to expect and I tend to feel he is rather overlooked as a credible actor due to his more outlandish early comedy films.  The direction is as good as anything Anderson has done before or since and the story balances on the cusp of sadness and triumph throughout, not giving anything away until the very end.

For a look at young unrequited love and the life of a young male adolescent, however unique he may be, this film is unmatched and the excellent direction, coupled with some stunning performances throws up a surprisingly good film that can be enjoyed again and again.

Jason Schwartzman is great, and Bill Murray may do his best work ever - side-splittingly funny, but with a damaged, sad, sometimes dangerous edge just under the surface.

As in all of Anderson's films, terrific use of songs as score, wonderfully inventive transitions and visual framing. And a lot of fun.

Add to the mix a pretty kindergarten teacher (Olivia Williams) that Max and one of his teachers (Bill Murray) fall in love with, and you have all the twists and turns of a high school soap opera.

1021111,2,6305428239,"I am a huge fan of `The Royal Tenenbaums', but I couldn't rally behind `Rushmore' the way I thought I would.  The acting was superb across the board, and the humor, when it hit, was hilarious; but there was just something about this movie that didn't sit well with me.  I found myself wondering where this movie was going; what point it was trying to make.  There are many scenes where it feels like this movie doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be.  Is it a comedy, is it a drama, is it an intellectual farce, is it a tearjerker; is it neither?  I found the contemplation of the films intent to be tiresome and draining and thus I found my feelings for the film in general to be rather indifferent.

I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't.

The film tells the story of Max Fisher (an outstanding Jason Schwartzman), a young fifteen-year-old who is just making it at Rushmore.  He is failing everything yet his indulgence in extracurricular activities keeps him active in the school.  He's fallen for the young widowed teacher Rosemary Cross and become friends with Rushmore alumnus and industrial tycoon Herman Blume.  When those two friendships cross paths though, Max's world comes crashing down on him.

`Rushmore' is heralded by many as a near masterpiece and is placed alongside classics like `The Graduate' as one of the best coming-of-age stories out there, but I sorely disagree.  What `The Graduate' has that `Rushmore' lacks is a common strain of thought.  Instead of focusing its attention on a primary subject, `Rushmore' seems to barely find its footing, skirting along various focal points, never really settling down to uncover the meat of the film.  I found some of the performances to feel disjointed from the film because they seemed to be from a completely different genre.  Case-in-point; Schwartzman is purely comic while Olivia Williams is pure drama.  There is a scene where Max confronts Rosemary about his feelings, and her response seemed so unnatural when taken in the context of the film; it just didn't flow.

Bill Murray is the only actor who actually `gets' it.  His delivery is comic, yet in that subtly dramatic way (as he was in `Lost in Translation') and it seems to elevate each scene he is in.  He plays Herman with the perfect mixture of misery and humor.  His performance is so good that I'm appalled he was denied an Oscar nomination, despite his winning several critics awards.  This isn't to say that Schwartzman and Williams aren't wonderful (Schwartzman is really at the top of his game, and the character fits him like a glove; and Williams is very moving in her scenes and understandably endearing) I just feel that they contradict one another in their approach to the material.

I can see why some adore this film, for it has its moments of quirky delightfulness, but in the end I feel that it misses what it was striving for and winds up being less than one would expect.  If it had some better direction maybe, or any direction, the film would have realized its potential and made good use of its stars.  I'll admit that the final Vietnam War themed school play was a hoot, but for the most part I found myself to bewildered to enjoy the humor.",1221782400,6,3206,4.6637010676156585
1021194,4,6305428239,"Rushmore is a great film and ultimately one of the best examples of Indie Auteur Wes Anderson's work.  This copy of the DVD is a great value for the $10 but isn't really enough for the true fan which I suggest the Criterion Edition.

The film is a great coming-of-age story as any of the other reviewers will tell you.  Some of the other reviewers report Anderson defining the rules of film making which is highly debatable, as I haven't seen anything that strikes me as vividly as films by other film makers like Jim Jarmusch.  This film is Anderson's first break out and perhaps his most original and interesting as if you've seen this one you'll easily recognize the style and humor in the rest of his films as he does not deviate much from his success but I do feel this film is important in the cannon of American independent film.

The performance by Bill Murray is my favorite, other viewers report this showing his largest range of emotion but I find it sticks to sarcastic quips and subtle humor but doesn't develop as much as his later films.  This was his first real turn to the actor we see him as today lining him up for Broken Flowers, Lost in Translation and Life Aquatic.  I do love his role and think he holds some amazing lines in the film.  Jason Schwartzman is great and seeing him early in his career gives the audience a chance to see  his development into the actor he's now known as.

The film itself is a comedy about a 15 year old in prep school, based largely on Anderson's experience with prep school himself which brings a personal touch to the film that helps develop the lead into a believable character.  The humor as others have mentioned is sarcastic and subtle but the soundtrack brit-invasion as Anderson is known for and the movie is worth seeing especially at the $10 value.  I feel the film gets a little more credit than it deserves but in all is a good watch.",1219622400,2,1900,4.42816091954023
1021195,5,6305428239,"Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson wrote and created a film that is profoundly rich in its portrayal of multifaceted characters, three lonely and wounded people. I have seen many coming of age films, from comedies to dramas, from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". ""Rushmore"" is one of my favorites, a total standout with its own unique flavor and style. It is at times dark, quirky, funny, joyful, heartbreaking, and triumphant.

I can't imagine this film without Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. They are both so good here. You can't help liking them, loathing them, pitying them, laughing at them, cheering for them, and hoping for them to find some thread of happiness. They start out friends, then enemies, then friends again but stronger. This film really is about friendships.

Max Fischer is easily one of the most fascinating and interesting characters I have encountered in the movies. He is a creative dynamo and yet he is flawed and vulnerable. Max is (pardon all the adjectives) witty, cruel, clever, resilient, funny, dangerous, foolish, brilliant, lonely, formidable, and damaged. This is not a character you've seen before in a film.

I was particularly impressed with one friendship in ""Rushmore"", which was that of Dirk and Max. I felt their history together; you just know they've been buddies for a long time, and have had many schemes and fun times... and when there was a big rift between them, I actually was hoping that their bond would not be broken permanently.

When it comes down to it, this is (for me) a love story about a young man and the time of his life. Rushmore is more than a school to Max, it is a time. I remember that time in my life, and I think that the fact that it has to end or change is rather sad and unfair (but inevitable). It's a heady time with so many things going on: changes, self image issues, first loves, learning, socializing, making mistakes, friendship, creating, failing, fighting, and slowly beginning to discover your place in life. ""Rushmore"" captures a genuine taste of this time.

I really wish ""Rushmore"" had become a TV series, an hourly 'dramedy'. It has a perfect setting and characters for that. The film left me wanting to see more stories involving Max and his world.",1213660800,6,2259,4.782051282051282

Jason Schwartzman -- Talia Shire's son -- played the lead in this 1998 dramedy as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy in Houston. Max is everything -- head of the fencing team, the beekeepers, most other oddball clubs -- except a very good student. This becomes his downfall and, finally, his salvation.

There's not much point in describing what goes on in the movie, its script, or its other actors (including Bill Murray in one of those roles that defined him in middle age before his breakout in ""Lost In Transition"") other than to say this film merges elements of romance, teen hijinks, class warfare and derision into a stew that almost no one will be able to resist.

There is something you've never seen in a film before happening in almost every scene.

Each of the featured characters is scarred by one or more of the following: loss, lies and love. The juxtaposition throughout of how it affects the individual and the situation with others involved is subtle, yet vital.

Jason Schwartzman is the rebellious teen, Max Fischer, whose life is structured around his extra-curricular responsibilities at Rushmore Academy. But he is teetering on expulsion due to poor grades, though he has a gift in playwriting and bringing people into his real-life drama.

Bill Murray (school booster, Mr. Blume) and Olivia Williams (first grade teacher, Miss Cross), respectively, capture the hard work of a man who has built great wealth - in the steel industry - but has not forgotten where he came from and the young, overqualified teacher who has special, altruistic reasons to enter the field.

It looked like a smarmy, Gen X ""ironic"" movie to me, so I avoided it for a bit, but then decided to go see it.  It is a brilliant, funny, honest, heartfelt film, the best film I've seen from Wes Anderson.  It has great performances by Jason Schwartzman as Max and Bill Murray, and also Seymour Cassel (a Cassavettes veteran) as Max's father, Olivia Willams as Max's ""love interest"", and Brian Cox as the dean of Rushmore.  Never does the film feel condescending like a lot of ""hip"" films during this time had a tendency to do.  It doesn't feel smarmy or sleazy.  In the hands of a ""hip"" director, they could have needled Max's character, mocking him and making fun of him.  Anderson didn't.  Wes (and co-writer Owen Wilson, who should write more) made all their characters like real people.  And the film has one of the greatest soundtracks EVER.  It is filled with British invasion hits, and the use of The Who's A Quick One While He's Away is truly inspired.  Anderson gets major points for using the live version from The Rock and Roll Circus instead of the studio version, which isn't as good.

Under Mr. Andersn's impeccable direction, the excellent cast makes this a most rewarding experience.

  The story concerns one Max Fischer, 15 years old, student at the illustrious Rushmore Academy. But Max is not your average student- he's one of the worst.
  Max (Schwartzman) befriends wealthy industrialist Herman Bloom (Murray), and falls in love with Rushmore's newest teacher, Rosemary, a widow from England, and unleashes some truly machiavellian schemes to get her to fall in love with him, (including trying to build an unauthorized aquarium for her on school grounds, backed by Mr. Bloom's millions), getting himself expelled in the process. Meanwhile, the married Herman also falls in love with her and they begin to have an affair, which sets off one of the funniest sequences in American film history; watching a 50 year-old man being attacked by bees that have mysteriously invaded his hotel room and intentionally running over a 15 year old boy's bicycle always makes me smile.
  In the end, Max learns alot about life and love and friendship and all of that, and makes peace with Mr. Bloom, Rosemary, the memory of his deceased mother and the end of his tenure at Rushmore Academy. While watching, ask yourself why Max does what he does, why he never wants to leave Rushmore- his reason, never stated, is among the most touching aspects of a character that I have ever seen in any movie.
  The soundtrack is truly amazing, as with all of the Wes Anderson films; check out The Who singing ""A Quick One While He's Away.""

But it also seems like some people don't like the movie because it's different. I guess that if you're patient and you like the little things, you'll enjoy this movie. Also, if you feel like you're left out or sort of an outcast you might enjoy this movie.

I, too, found him to be a pompous spoiled brat and often times bordered on the creepy side in his pursuit of Mrs. Cross.  And I'm not sure where his air of entitlement came from.  For a boy with such humble orgins, his character seems totally out of whack.  Bill Murray surely has his middle-aged blues shtick down (Lost in translation/Broken Flowers).  he, too, was not a character I could root for.  I understand he was not happy with the direction of his life, but the whole affair thing just seems so typical...and I'm not sure if he and Mrs. Cross were going to pick up things where they left off or not.  Max never does pick up his grades or cut back on the extracurriculum activies--so I'm not sure about his character arch.  He's pretty much the same boy at the end of the film as he was in the begining.  Oh, except, he does admit his father is a barber now.

1021288,3,6305428239,"OK...my title is a little mean, but I found this kid, whom we're supposed to ""just love"" a little mean and the fact that I lost sympathy for him early on (due to his meanness) kept me from rooting for him.  This is defintely a film in which we are supposed to root for the hero (or the anti-hero)...the adorable short nerdy kid with a big nose and glasses. His mother died of cancer, his father is a poor-but-good hearted barber,

he got into this fancy prep school on a scholarship, he is so smart that he solved a math problem that stumped MIT profs in a matter of minutes, etc. And the school bully picks on him.

Well he isn't really that nice, himself.  He's insufferably rude to the Chinese girl, destroys Blume's marriage without a second thought, disables Blume's car which could have killed him.  But he's still ""adorable nerdy Max"" so we're supposed to overlook these quirks and love him.  I found his egotism much more annoying than cute.

I suspect that guys who felt like nerds in middle school might like this film due to some sort of wish fulfillment but beware, he doesn't end up with the pretty school teacher in the end!  Maybe if another, more naturally likable actor had starred I'd have more interest in him..(Leonardo DiCaprio captured our sympathy as a young kid, in spite of committing huge crimes in Catch Me if You Can and I think that a lot of that was due to DiCaprio's natural sweetness)  Jason Shwartzman (whom I actually liked a lot in Marie Antoinette) just didn't grab my heart the way the script obviously intended.  Only once, when he smiled in the end did he seem a little sympathetic. For most of the film he sails through his antics with a vague superior smirk on an opaque, masklike face. There's no light there except an evil glint in his eyes  when he's seeking revenge.

He looks like a cross between Woody Allan and Groucho Marx (were those his real eyebrows?.) Maybe if you find those guys endearing, you'll love Max.  Otherwise... well, I warned you.

On the plus side, Bill Murray was genuinely touching and funny and many of the supporting cast were  very good. I liked the music too.",1173484800,3,2131,4.513020833333333
1021289,5,6305428239,"The chemistry between Jason Schwartzman & Bill Murray is what really makes this movie great.  The supporting cast does an admirable job as well.  I really love Seymour Cassell's role as Max's (Schwartzman)father and it's always a treat to see him on screen.  Out of the four Wes Anderson films this one I feel is the funniest and by far the darkest of the lot. It also has great music as well (with the highlight being Cat Steven's rendition of ""Here Comes My Baby"").  I don't believe that Bill Murray was even nominated for an Academy Award for this film and that is an absolute crime.  His performance was his best ever and it just goes to show you that the Oscars have become almost a joke nowadays.  After I saw this film I was convinced that Schwartzman was headed for superstardom.  However, I guess he was born to play this role because he hasn't really been in anything that memorable since and his acting has never been close to as good.  He was great in this film though!  I have never seen a more lovable, cooler geek portrayed on film in my whole life.  This is the first Wes Anderson film I had ever seen and I have been a big fan ever since.

1021290,4,6305428239,"Wes Anderson has a nice light touch in the comedy department.  He also has a unique style.  Whereas most prep school coming of age stories attempt a kind of been-there realism, what Anderson achieves here is something close to a kid's fantasy framed in realism.

Jason Schwartzman stars as 15-year-old Max Fischer whose claim to fame is flunking most of his classes at Rushmore prep while being a boy genius who leads a dozen extra curricular activities including writing and directing his own plays.  He's a kind of dark browed Woody Allen in the making.  Bill Murray, slightly subdued and under comedic control, gives support as Herman Blume the millionaire entrepreneur who is impressed with Fischer's accomplishments and style.  Olivia Williams is the grade school teacher they both adore.

Well, if you are a slightly nerdish boy (or were one) this movie is going to just pop your tart.  So wish-fulfilling is the story that at any moment I expected Max Fischer to hop into a phone booth and come out in leotards and cape.  Even the plays Max writes embody a boy's dream of being a man: Serpico as played by teens, Platoon (or Apocalypse Now) in the high school gym.  But I have to say anybody who watches this movie and doesn't feel a bit of nostalgia for childhood needs to have his bedpan changed.

Max is a slacker who doesn't slack.  Max is to be preferred to Blume's own idiot kids.  Max can lead the boys at public or private schools.  It doesn't matter.  Max can almost win the girl, even though she is a dozen or so years older and six inches taller.  Max can take a punch.  Max has inexhaustible energy.  Max is a leader and liked and respected by all but the school bully (whom he wins over and puts to work).  Max probably will get into his safety school, Harvard, by scoring a perfect 2400 on his SATs.  Humm, maybe that's a good idea for a sequel--oh, too late for a sequel, and anyway The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) certainly is better than any sequel.

Well, how about Max grows up and becomes an astronaut, the first man on Mars?  Or better yet, Max grows up and becomes--Wes Anderson!

I have one MAJOR problem with this movie.  What is with all the cigarettes?  Wes, did you get some backing from Phillip Morris?  I am so tired of cigarettes in movies where they serve no plot or character purpose, where they are planted merely to entice young people into a lifetime of addiction.  Wes Anderson, now that you have found some fame and fortune, please remember: smoking cigarettes causes cancer and taking money from cigarette companies is, at the very least,  Bad Form.",1165881600,4,2590,4.596069868995633

And on top of that, there are plenty of very funny lines and the delight of seeing both ""Serpico"" and ""Platoon"" produced for the high school stage.

1021292,5,6305428239,"""Rushmore"" serves as an interesting reference for semiotic analysis because its director, Wes Anderson, is a unique auteur.  He understands paradigmatic choices and commands them with a satirical tone characteristic in his films.  When performing this semiotic analysis, it helps to keep in mind the film's target audience as a point of reference.  This film is probably intended for an American audience of almost all ages however I think younger audiences, who have recently been through high school, could relate to the film in particular.  Even further, this movie could be considered only for the growing cult of loyal Wes Anderson fans who follow his distinctive brand of film.  For practical purposes of this essay, we will only examine the introductory scene from the movie paradigmatically and then look at some of its oppositions.

Anderson wastes no time establishing the quirky and mildly uplifting mood found throughout the movie.  As the Touchstone Pictures logo moves on screen, we hear the jubilant plucking of a mandolin and are delighted because we expect this to be a lighthearted ""fun"" movie.  Anderson's introduction is dissimilar from most other big budget movies in that it does not begin with a lengthy montage of credits; a strategy intended to set him apart from the Hollywood norm much in the way an oil painter seeks  his/her avant-garde style.

Painting of the Blumes

The first shot fades in to a family portrait on an easel to the left of the screen with a red curtain closed in the background.  ""Touchstone Pictures presents"" appears on the right in Anderson's trademark bold Futura font.  It is important to note that like his other paradigmatic choices, Anderson's consistent selection of Futura font found in all his films is deeply personal and may not be fully understood by the audience.  A set of curtains open to reveal the Rushmore plaque on a gate just outside the campus.

This shot comprises an array of unusually crafted paradigmatic choices.  Denotatively, the fact that the portrait is painted suggests that the family depicted is part of an elite upper class.  Many families in America have their family portrait hanging in the living room but they are usually photographed because it is a significantly cheaper.  An original painting suggests the high importance and appreciation of art that many upper class families boast.  In the painting, everyone appears to be happy and normal except the father figure, Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is not standing next to his wife; instead he sits in the foreground with the look of pain on his face and a cigarette drooping off the corner of his mouth.  Obviously this man has problems.  The two adolescent twins are wearing the exact same outfit with the exact same haircut.  Therefore, we can assume their interests and personalities are similar as well.  Their clothes are part of a private school uniform; another indication of the family's wealth.  Anderson consistently exploits the ambiguous relationship between the signifier and the signified to draw humor.  Many of his paradigmatic choices seem random and cannot be explained logically.  For example, the drab green sheet in the painting's background is subtly humorous because of its hideous color and presence.  Indeed, it is noticeable but its presence cannot be fully explained.  Even the quality of the painting itself is an odd paradigmatic choice.  The colors are basic and the faces look almost cartoon-like; the entire painting hints the unrefined work of an art student in training.  Why would a wealthy man, who could afford to commission the best artist money can buy, hire someone with sub par skills?  What family would find it acceptable for the father to pose by himself in the foreground with a frown on his face for a family portrait?  These are the kind odd paradigmatic choices Anderson uses to dance on the fence between realistic life and satirical exaggeration.  It is also important to note the choice to include an opening curtain.  Anderson reminds us that we are watching a completely fictitious play on screen; a fantasy world completely separate from our own.  The curtain serves as an intermediary in this transition.

Max's Dream

A student asks about an extra credit problem on a forgotten chalkboard in the classroom and the teacher explains that it is ""just a joke"" geometry problem even his mentor from MIT cannot solve.  The students whisper about this amongst themselves and the name ""Max Fisher"" surfaces a few times.  Max Fisher is called on, who is busy reading the Wall Street Journal, but causally gets out of his desk to work out the problem.  He fills most of the chalkboard with his mathematical steps written neatly in calligraphy and finally arrives with an answer.  The teacher nods in approval and the whole class cheers for him.  Max then wakes up from his dream.

The film's protagonist, Max Fisher, is introduced in a dream sequence taking place in a Geometry class at Rushmore.  Connotatively, I can immediately identify with the algebraic symbols and graphs on the chalkboard from when I took Geometry in high school.  Even the crusty white writing of chalk on a blackboard alone can conjure an array of memories from an academic environment.  The boxed off list of homework assignments on the top right corner of the chalkboard, random colored papers posted on the wall, and black board eraser smudges are hardly noticed in this scene, however they all serve as an effective sign system which provide the realistic detail authenticating Anderson's work.  The teacher dresses conservatively in a beige V-neck sweater vest and a dry, monotone speech pattern to match.  We can stereotype his dull persona as the result of a lifelong dedication to advanced mathematics.  By this time, the audience is aware that Rushmore is an elite private high school but may find it hard to identify with the setting since the majority of people go to public schools.  We expect Rushmore to be filled with the best teachers, a nurturing administration, and endless opportunity.  This is evident when Max gets expelled from Rushmore because of his bad grades and forced into the public school system.  His former club activities such as fencing are no longer embraced by the public school community and he is not allowed to use the public phone without a hall pass.

 Max's dream sequence elicits the following main oppositions:

Student vs. Teacher

Student vs. Students

Public vs. Private School

The Intelligent vs. The Average

In his dream, Max is idealizing that he is the exact opposite of what he is.  The teacher and students respect him for his academic prowess but in reality, he is ""one of the worse student's we've got,"" according to the president of Rushmore in a later scene.  When Herman Blume asks his twin sons if they invited Max to their birthday party and they respond in disgust: ""Max Fisher? Common Dad there's gonna be girls there.  I'd rather die.""  With Max's odd fashion sense, neatly parted hair, thick framed glasses, and braces, he is denotatively the stereotypical nerdy kid in school.  Connotatively, his character traits eventually unfold to reveal his enthusiasm for extra-curricular activities, great organization skills, and finally his compassion for others.  Max's nonconformity with the ""average kids"" in school and his poor academic infamy with the school's administrators allow him to surprise viewers with his ambitious club endeavors such as directing a hit play about the Vietnam War complete with real dynamite pyrotechnics.  The audience is willing to accept this precocious behavior from a student attending a private school which presumably admits only the most gifted applicants.  We recognize that school uniforms are commonly worn at private schools and are intended to maintain a presentable student and encourage equality.  However, many kids do not adhere to conformity by individualizing their uniform; they can take off their jacket, roll their sleeves up, and untuck their shirt if they want to.  Max, on the other hand, breaks this trend by wearing his complete Rushmore school uniform while the other students prefer the relaxed look of the light blue collar shirt.  This stark difference is accentuated further when Max stands to clap for the Herman Blume's chapel speech in the next scene.  Max's dark navy blue blazer is unmistakable amongst the sea of light blue shirts in the congregation; an obvious statement that he is the black sheep.

 In conclusion, Anderson's unique brand of paradigmatic choices in ""Rushmore"" allows for an interesting semiotic analysis because they are not always produce a relevant meaning.  Although he follows many of the same semiotic strategies to convey meaning as other directors, Anderson plays with the non-existential relationship between the signifier and signified in his paradigmatic choices to provoke confusion and humor.  He is a quiet reminder that film is an art form and not a science of optimizing commercial success.  For the true auteur, there are no rules.",1160956800,5,9060,5.075050709939148

Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson's melding of/take on 'Catcher in the Rye' and 'Harold and Maude' turned out to be far more of a success than they could have ever imagined.  Hailed world wide as the arrival of a new force in film making, even though it's Anderson's second film, Rushmore put Jason Schwartzman into the spotlight and thrust Bill Murray back into homes all over America.

Rushmore is, basically, the story a woman you can't have, and the effect it has on the two men who want her. (Jules & Jim automatically comes to mind as another influence.)  Schwartzman plays, masterfully, Max Fischer - doing his best to involve himself in as many extracurricular activities as possible, and to avoid homework as often as he can.  Max is growing up too quickly, he has an air of pseudomaturity, and this only raises in intensity when he meets Rosemary, a teacher at his school.

He does his best to impress her, as any young boy in love would.  He buys her new fish, and seems interested in her life outside of school.  She catches on and informs him that he's far too young for her.

All the while, Murray's character, Harold Bloom, is miserable in his life with his cheating wife and annoying twin sons.  He meets Max and is strangely in awe of the young man and his tenacity.  Through Max he meets Rosemary and he too falls for her subtle charms.

What follows is a war between two men, well, one man and a boy, a war for something neither one could ever acquire.

This film was the beginning of the long and fruitful collaberation between Wes Anderson and Murray -- and, in my opinion, it is the best in the series so far.

Prior to seeing this film, I thought of Bill Murray as a good character actor -- a clunky physical comedian who was essentially rehashing his SNL days in a series of mediocre films.  This movie blew a hole through that misperception.  This is an essential Murray performance, in which he shows how truly expressive he can be -- every one of his facial twitches and tics is as good as ten pages of dialogue.

And that is to say nothing of the rest of the cast.  In particular, Jason Schwartzmann plays one of the most inspired characters in modern cinematic history: an adolescent whose massive optimism and intelligence work in tandem to overcome his (also significant) naivete.

You know, that rare brand that makes you laugh but you're not exactly sure what you are laughing about. A movie with the mordant tone of Donnie Darko or The Royal Tennenbaums.

And Rushmore I'd contend is the most extraordinary feather in his illustrious cap to date. It is difficult to classify. Romance features as a pervasive undercurrent, full of mercurial dialogue and quirky moments, but it's not merely a romantic-comedy. It's not even your average angst-filled coming-of-age story. It's an oddity with a flowy screenplay that begs to be discovered individually, for oneself.

The acting all round is top notch. Schwatzman, our young protagonist, is very intriguing in his potrayal of an academically challenged overachiever. Murray delivers a rock solid sad-sack performance as usual, his long face speaking volumes.

The brand of subtle humour may not spring out to everyone but is hilarious when pondered over. For instance,

""Are you a neurosurgeon?""

""No, I'm a barber. But many people make that mistake.""

It's anything but an ordinary movie, it does not follow the typical mindset of opening-body-conclusion and its funky vibe may not appeal to everyone. But if you have an appetite for the unusual, it's a very, very beautiful caper and all its weirdness makes perfect sense within its context.

They are well-made with talented actors, for one.  I also have a theory that intellectual comedy snobs love static like this so they can feel superior to the great unwashed who just want to laugh (I'll take DUMB AND DUMBER any day).

Roger Ebert recently wrote in a review: ""As I grow weary of films like THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2, which follow their formulas with relentless fidelity to cliche and stereotype, I feel gratitude to directors who make something new.""

And I agree.  But that doesn't make ""new"" equal ""good.""

Make us laugh.

As good as Bill Murray is in this film (and he's great), I will still pluck CADDYSHACK off the shelf to watch instead of RUSHMORE.",1093824000,7,1092,4.577319587628866
1021465,5,6305428239,"Rushmore stands alone among movies about young teenagers at a time in their life when anything is possible.  I know that sounds cliche, but how else could someone genuinely believe they could attract a woman twice his age who is a teacher at his school (Rosemary Cross)?  If Max Fischer were a few years older, he would be considered delusional, but his age forgives his optimism.

Bill Murray's character, Herman Blume, is an unhappy old man who can probably remember a time when he believed that things like money or family would make him happy.  Max and Rosemary Cross manage to fill two voids in his life, love and the belief in things that can make his life worthwhile.

If this were a stupid teenage fantasy movie, Max might actually get Rosemary to sleep with him, but it is far to smart for that.  In the end, all three main characters benefit from knowing eachother, even if it was not the way they wanted.",1093651200,3,915,4.548780487804878

The humor is never funny enough to laugh out loud and sometimes not even funny at all. The part of of Bill Murray was fine, like in 'Groundhog Day' or 'Lost in Translation' but not special. Only good thing then was the sound track.

But sometimes you have some of those movies that make you think and this was one of them. The more I had to think about it the better the story got, the better Jason Schartzman got and the more brilliant Bill Murray became. All of a sudden I started laughing about things I hadn't thought of before!

The movie is great, the main character both charming and sad at the same time. He is sometimes vicious, not complete worldwise but warms up in the end. His friendship, then fight, than friendship with Murray is hilarious. Every teen will see something of himself back in Schartzman.

Second, it was not a re-hash of some old story line with the same old actors. It is a very well written comedic coming of age movie.  Few movies take the time or effort to develop complex, flawed and genuine characters, but director Wes Anderson apparently understands the value of doing so. The emotionally stagnating business tycoon Herman Blume is played brilliantly by Bill Murray - the disappointment he feels with his banal life and idiotic children is wrenchingly palpable. But Rushmore Academy student and quirky prodigy Max Fischer enters Herman Blume's dull life, renewing his enthusiam. The movie is both thought provoking and hilarious. Particularly enjoyable are Max's adaptations of ""Serpico"" and ""Platoon"" for the high-school drama club.  Hands down this was the best comedy produced in the 90's. With the decade that produced MTV sex and bathroom joke frat boy movies, this film offers an intelligent script, cast of characters, and an excellent soundtrack.",1083283200,122,1148,5.133689839572193

I think the main theme to this movie is obsession, as max moves from one to another. The other theme could be commitment, because it shows the amount of effort max puts in to everything he does and tries to see it to the end.
I think it was acted out well, in showing the tourment each character was put through. I believe the soundtrack helped to movie progress, helping to emphase the mood within the scene.
I think it was a typically enjoyable movie in which has an originality to it, yet the story of trying to win over love has been done before. The style was very different, although it ran smoothly, it wasn't predicable as you weren't quite sure how it would end.

1021549,5,6305428239,"A story about an overachieving high school student and a depressed millionaire fighting for the love of a preschool teacher sounds too bizarre to be made into a Hollywood movie, right? Well, not for Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. They came up with one of the smartest, most captivating screenplays in recent years and paired that with Anderson's fantastic and very personal style of directing, and with great casting for the lead roles. The result? Rushmore, one of the best movies you'll ever get a chance to see.
Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) is a high school student. He goes to Rushmore. He has it all figured out - he is an average student at best, but his extra-curricular activities can not be contained. He's the president, or founder, or director to almost every single group, club or association in the school, ranging from calligraphy and debate to sword fighting and go-kart racing. And, most of all, he's the head of the Max Fisher Players theater troup.
He meets Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a tired, depressed man who happens to be a millionaire . He has two annoying sons who go to school with Max. They hit it off and become friends - Max finds someone to look up to (other than his barber dad) and Blume finds someone that sparks the interest he lacks for everything else in life.
Enter Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). Max falls in love with her at first sight, but of course, she pays no attention to him, so he recruits Mr. Blume to help him win her, but in the process, he too falls in love with the teacher. What follows is a hilarious battle of wits between the two as both try to get the other out of the way.
Although this story alone would make a good movie, Anderson's writing and directing take this film to the next level. The setting of the film manages to remain contemporary while not being truly current (if that makes any sense). The supporting characters surrounding the leads are also interesting and capture your attention from the first moment (especially Wilson's brother Luke, the great Brian Cox as Max's principal and Seymour Cassel as Max's father).
Another key element of the film is its music. Anderson is one of those directors that `gets' music and knows how to use it in his movies. I promise you that after watching this movie, you'll want to get the soundtrack to it.
Rushmore is truly a hidden gem, one of those great movies that almost no one saw at the theaters, but that has gained a somewhat large cult following . There is a great Criterion Collection DVD that you should check out to truly appreciate this work of art.
On a final, side note, Anderson and Wilson are the same team that brought us the also incredibly fantastic The Royal Tenenbaums (for which they were nominated for an Original Screenplay Oscar), also starring both Wilsons and Murray. As for Jason Schwartzman, he is another member of one of the most prolific Hollywood movies, the Coppolas - he's the grandson of Carmine Coppola, nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, son of Talia Shire, and cousin to Sofia Coppola, Nicolas Cage and Roman Coppola.",1081296000,6,3064,4.654981549815498

1021625,4,6305428239,"I struck up my acquaintance with the work of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson with the later The Royal Tenenbaums. I was not disappointed when I finally sat down to watch Rushmore. Anderson and Wilson have the extraordinary gift of being able to write characters and stories that are as deeply human and believable as they are absurdly surreal.
Like Tenenbaums, Rushmore is a film about vulnerable people finding their way through conflict to resolution and reconciliation. From my Christian point of view, I like to see it as GRACE. In the world of Rushmore, there is even hope for a washed-up old failure like tycoon Herman Blume (Bill Murray).
The filmmakers place in their world characters who are poles apart from one another: Rich and poor; English, Scottish and American; young and old; western and eastern. Somehow events conspire to show the characters their commonality; something breaks; and through the cracks we see glimpses of healing.
Performances are incredible. I have never been a fan of Murray, but after this, I can see myself fast becoming a devotee. Schwartzman veers brilliantly between suavely sophisticated and grimacingly geeky. Seymour Cassel is a talent I would like to see more of: His brief appearances here and in Tenenbaums are to be treasured. There is even an amusing turn from Mason Gamble, who doesn't seem to have aged a bit since Dennis the Menace.
The humour is subtle, yet hilarious to those with whom this brand of quirkiness resonates. For me, its funniness comes from the fact that the comedy is not arbitrary---no banana skins for banana skins' sake---but is made part and parcel of the characters, who they are and how they develop.
I know this is a film I will watch over and over, simply because it resonates me on the deepest level as a human being---contra the critics who say that Anderson and Wilson's films lack heart and warmth. My favourite films have always been about vulnerable people who find courage and a means to healing, and Rushmore does that with the best of them.",1072656000,3,2024,4.8526011560693645

The fear of expulsion is ever hanging over his head.  Still he manages to mold his reality towards his view and interpretation.  Until he falls in love with a 1st grade teacher and battles for her love with a local tycoon played by Bill Murray.
Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman give us great performances, although Bill Murray sticks out due to his name.  When you see him act, you expect him to be Bill Murray.  In this role, he becomes the character.  I can see why he was nominated for so many awards.
What is Rushmore to each of the characters?  At the base, it is the elite academy at which Max is enrolled.  Later, Max would mention that everyone has his Rushmore.  Is this like a Waterloo, where everyone gets his comeuppance?  Or, is it more like Holy Grail of sorts?  All need a dream, but all need to have a firm does of reality.

1021628,5,6305428239,"Jason Schwartzman's portrayal of schmoozer par-excellence Max Fischer is one of the great performances in recent comedy.  You cannot separate the two, Schwartzman is so wedded to his character.  Yet, his depiction does not reek of ""method"" disingenuousness.
Max Fischer is a precocious and ingratiating young man who is already a ""professional student"" by aged 15 at the tony Rushmore Academy.  He's sort of a male Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon's defining role in Alexander Payne's ""Election""), a consummate extracurricular overachiever and president of every club in the yearbook.  Unfortunately -- unlike Tracy -- this leaves Max with little time for his studies, in which he is failing miserably.  Having sailed through school since second grade (when he was awarded a full scholarship to Rushmore for writing an original stage play based on Watergate, which one can infer was a ripoff of ""All the President's Men"" based on Max's later featured stage production, ""Serpico: An Original Play by Max Fischer""), Max now sees that his days are numbered.
This nevertheless does not impel Max to putting his nose to the grindstone; Rather, he finds more intricate ways of manipulating the school's dean and using his wiles to establish his status as an unexpendable big man on campus.  However, unlike the Ferris Bueller he imagines himself to be, Max is more an adolescent Walter Mitty, kind of a loner and dreamer.
As far as he is capable of a crisis of conscience, two interlopers in Max's life suddenly change his routine at Rushmore.  Self-made industrialist and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (played by the irrascible Bill Murray) picques Max's interest one day with a wonderfully off-the-wall ""get the rich boys in your crosshairs"" speech before the spoiled children of privilege who people Max's school, reaching only Max, a barber's son (whom Max has promoted to neurosurgeon in his conversations with others).  When Max gushes to Blume about his enthusiasm for his speech, Blume sees an opportunity to mentor Max.  Meanwhile, Max has developed a crush on a first grade teacher at Rushmore, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), which provides a few hilarious scenes as Max uses his full reserve of charm to woo the reluctant educator, who is mildly amused by Max's overconfident advances.  It is at this point that ""Rushmore"" could devolve into a sappy ABC After School Movie like ""Murder In Mew Hampshire,"" but director Wes Anderson instead handles the scenes farcically, in showing up Max more as Don Quixote than Don Juan.
In exchange for showing Max the ropes in the real world, Blume acts as Cyrano de Bergerac to Miss Cross, keeping tabs on her for Max, in hopes of arranging dalliances for Max and Miss Cross.  Of course, like the real Cyrano, Blume falls in love (or rather, lust) with Max's Roxanne, and it is at this point that the movie really takes off.
For unbeknownst to Blume, it is Max -- and not he -- who is the mentor, and Blume who will soon be schooled, as he finds himself in an battle of wits with the prodigious saboteur.  I won't give away the actual battle plan, but the scenes are both endearing and ingenious.  Bill Murray really shines as Herman Blume, and is his best recent performance since sleazy bowler Ernie McCracken in ""Kingpin.""
Because of his lax attitude towards his studies, Max finds himself out on his ear at Rushmore anyways, and has to attend public school for the first time in his life.
Once ensconsed at Grover Cleveland H.S., Max is back to his old tricks, and uses his overachieving zeal among the apathetic students to hatch a grand scheme to finally win back (not that he ever had) Miss Cross:  An extravagantly staged production of ""Heaven and Hell,"" a script lifted mostly from ""Apocalypse Now"" and Oliver Stone's Vietnam-era movies.  I was rolling on the floor during the staging, particularly when a couple of GIs were carrying a surfboard in front of the beachhead).
The movie ends wistfully, with the unrequited love between Max and Miss Cross still unfulfilled.  By this time, Max has reluctantly given into the advances of a fellow student, Margaret Yang (played by the beautiful Sara Tanaka), who is initially rebuffed by Max as Miss Cross had previously turned down Max's romantic overtures.
""Rushmore"" is a solid and offbeat movie that is a welcome detour from the hackneyed and formulaic comedies Hollywood is currently proferring.  Its combination of social satire, screwball situations and sadistic slapstick places Wes Anderson in the same patheon with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, Oliver Stone and Francis Ford Copolla, all of whose work has been adapted for the stage by the inimitable Max Fischer.",1034467200,4,4686,4.979513444302177

I weathered Deep Blue Sea and Deep Rising (no offense to the people that loved them), I plowed my way through Robot Holocaust (without the MST3K guys doing voice-over parody even!), I even survived The Mummy Returns, but after 30 minutes of this DVD, I had to stop it and watch a different movie.

1021675,5,6305428239,"The true love triangle involves bonds of affections in all directions.  It is Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot and their tortured relationships rather than Rhett loving Scarlett who loves Ashley who loves Melanie.  The true epic love triangle is difficult to carry off; recent case in point, ""Pearl Harbor.""  However, in ""Rushmore,"" we are once again fortunately enough to scale the heights of love the true love triangle.
If we follow the figurational logic of our paradigmatic example, then Bill Murray as Mr. Herman J. Blume is our Arthur, the king of all the limited world he surveys, but disenchanted with both his life and his wife.  As our Lancelot we have Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer, Mr. Extra-Curricular Activities at Rushmore, the prep school where in we lay our scene.  The bond between the two is what comes first, with Blume seeing Max as the son he never had (he cannot abide the twins he does have), and Max seeing Blume as the father of his dreams (Max loves his father, but tells everyone his father is a neurosurgeon rather than a barber).  It is Max who stumbles upon their Guinevere, Olivia Williams as Miss Rosemary Cross, a teacher at Rushmore.  Recently a widow, she is amused and flattered by Max's attention (He saves the Latin classes as a token of his affection), but obviously does not know where to draw the line.  When Blume becomes enamored of her as well, the relationship between the two males becomes, shall we say, strained.
Ironically, the more they go after each other, the more Blume and Max prove their true affinity for one another.  Your assumption is that ""Rushmore"" will end when the dust has settled and we see if anybody is left alive on the battlefield, but writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have higher aspirations.  The three main actors all turn in marvelously understated and subtle performances (yes, even Murray), so even though the action is going over the top, the film does not.  Every absurdity seems well grounded in the created reality of the world we are visiting.  For this Anderson gets additional credit as director.  ""Rushmore"" is a film that is wickedly funny without being wickedly cynical.  The obvious double bill for this film would be ""Election,"" which will only serve to underscore the effectiveness of the more subtle performances in ""Rushmore.""",1024704000,,2323,4.862944162436548

1021677,5,6305428239,"RUSHMORE constitutes a piece of celluloid which is amply demonstrative of what can be achieved when skilled construction is crossed with sublime imagination; what you get is a very addictive work, the repetitive viewings seeming to defy monotony and instead inspire further investigation.
Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson received one hell of a gift when their respective muses colluded on this remarkable screenplay, a script so worthy of praise and adulation one has to wonder if the Devil itself helped them with it.  The movie recites the tale of Max Fischer, something of a paradox- on the one hand, he is a wunderkind writer and an extremely gregarious lad whose social skills border on the level of a savant, while on the opposite extremity he is an underachieving, academic failure who has no time to ponder the theorems and axioms of Euclidean geometry.  He's a dreamer, he's caught up in his role as resident playwright at Rushmore, he is the founder of just about all the cool clubs (and the not-so-cool ones as well), and he basks in all the saturating glory afforded him by his private-school compatriots...why bother himself with dry, insipid textbooks?
Well, for one thing, he's on the verge of being kicked out of his beloved Rushmore, a concept he finds beyond anathema.  But try as he might, he just can't get into the swing of things.  And another complication is added to his already challenged world: Miss Rosemary Cross, the institution's new pedagogue.  An infatuation with the bursting energy of a quasar builds up inside his psyche, he becomes obsessed by this crush; but, as fate would have it- as fate always has it- Cross is not the least bit interested in crossing the anachronistic line which separates them.
Enter Herman J. Blume, wealthy industrialist and Rushmore benefactor.  Played with understated and sardonic elegance by expert-of-the-everyman-character and erstwhile member of the Saturday Night Live repertory Bill Murray, Blume develops a paternal bond with Fischer, finding in him a sharp contrast with his twin sons, a pair of progeny both crude in demeanor and lacking in high-level cognitive abilities.  He wishes Fischer was the product of his loins instead of what he's been cursed with, and he makes overtures to the boy by hanging with him and aiding him when necessary.
A nasty thing then develops: Blume falls for Cross.  Talk about a tempest.  To say Fischer was hurt is to call the Big Bang a Little Pop.  By this time, the Rushmore student's shenanigans succeed in getting him expelled to a public school; having Blume now on Cross's tail in addition to such an indignity sends him over the edge, and a give-and-take battle erupts between the two, with Max siccing angry bees on his adversary and Herman crushing the kid's bicycle under his vehicle's tires.  Poor Miss Cross is caught in the crossfire, and becomes exasperated with the both of them.  But Fischer has one more play in him, and as he begins to assimilate the damage that he's done and received, he uses it to find some semblance of sanity not only for himself but for Herman and Rosemary.
RUSHMORE is a complex tapestry of technique, make no mistake about it.  The filmmaking protocols and paradigms at work are quite subtle for the most part, yet are discernible for those willing to invest even a cursory analysis; it is an entire semester's worth at Emerson or UCLA, covering even the most ambitious syllabus.  Director Anderson is a genius at detail and execution, and he knows about pace- above all, he keeps things moving, and in fun, interesting ways.  Great example is when Max requests seed money from Blume for a project; watch as the dialogue's linear course is broken up into several successive scene changes, thus granting the illusion of swift shifting through the story's arc.  Each scene's vector is calculated with meticulous grace, the mathematics at work making sure that the sequences last as long as they need to (of course, this is not to suggest that such calculation is consciously going on in the mind of the director; but music is, as they say, just a prettier way of expressing number manipulation, and who can argue that a great movie is like a great song?).  Every subplot- and there really aren't any subplots in a sense, more like subconcepts- is treated appropriately and amplifies the value of the alpha plot.  As such, this is one of the best-edited works to come along in quite some time; it is worthy to note that it is probably due to the seminal reach of early-MTV videos, making proper use of the better trappings of that particular- and perhaps dubious- art form (good example: the yearbook-like montage of Fischer's clubs).
Anderson doesn't stop there.  No, for his camera moves are slick and fluid when not static (when they are static, the above-mentioned quick-cut editing adds the style).  And his direction is as masterful as it is practical; although it cannot be stated with surety, it definitely seems as if he's a minimalist when it comes to giving orders, preferring instead to allow the thespians under his tutelage broad range of interpretation...given the nature of the material, it is probably a sagacious choice, since it is best for actors to draw upon their own experiences when it comes to slice-of-life artistic endeavors.  The soundtrack is almost a character in its own right, and is comprised of a song collection which not only captures the mood of the varied moments throughout the film with sharp accuracy but is catchy and offbeat; the excellent score was done by former head Devo Mark Mothersbaugh, the Pepsi to Danny Elfman's Coke.
RUSHMORE comes highly recommended.  More could be said about it, but the thousand-word limit has almost been reached.  If you've ever had a debilitating crush on the opposite sex, you'll enjoy it's nuances...",1022025600,,5824,4.90233977619532
1021678,5,6305428239,"With the movies I really love it usually takes a couple of viewings for me to fully grasp their complexity, the greatness.  With ""Rushmore"", however, I walked out of the theater immediately in a daze of pleasure.  It seemed as if the film revealed it self to me completely and wholly at once.  What makes it so special is the dazzling juggling act of hilarity and depression--and how one is a cure for the other.  The key to the film is the affecting performance by Bill Murray as millionaire Herman Blume (for which he was robbed of an Oscar.)  It's as convincing and touching a portrayal of angst as you could ever see.  Death haunts this movie--the death of Max's mother, of Ms. Cross' husband.  And it's just lightly touched on that Herman is a Vietnam vet (and has seen his share of death), but the traumas of the 1960's and 1970's seem to permeate every frame of the movie--check out Max's plays.  Herman is steeped in melancholy.  It's only Max Fishcer's riotously warped vision of forgiveness and reconciliation that allows Herman to come alive again.  (Notice how during the final production, set in the Vietnam war, Herman is the only member of the audience to *not* put his protective goggles on.)  Some days, I wake up feeling like Blume.  That's the days I need to put ""Rushmore"" in the VCR.",1018310400,2,1304,4.597402597402597

I've heard some people call it disturbing, which I can understand, but it doesn't make the movie any less great. It makes it better if you ask me. I have also heard people say they think Jason schwartzman is annoying in it and I have to disagree with that. I think he did a great job and I don't think it would have been as good if performed by someone else. The movie has some sort of intense parts, but overall, it's a movie you don't want to pass up. Bill Murray did a great job also, just perfect. I absolutely loved the music in the movie also, I need to get the soundtrack.

1021680,5,6305428239,"Of course, to include it in such a genre is really an insult, but it is about a teenager and it is quite funny. But it is in no way, shape, or form a genre comedy, and in fact is more heartfelt and moving than the vast mojority of dramas.
Many people have commented on the brilliant performance given by Bill Murray, but Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams also give nearly flawless efforts. I've heard people complain that Schwartzman is annoying and unlikeable - and certainly he is eccentric - but I'd argue that Max Fisher is a timeless example of the dynamic protaganist; he begins his year at Rushmore as an obsessed, pretentious, sexually-frustrated teen (girls aren't his *forte*), and ends up with a very different perspective on life, learning, and love. Williams couldn't be better in her ability to combine a strong intellect with vulnerability.
But, of course, Murray steals the show in the long run. He is a wonderful anti-hero who ultimately just wants to be a simple, happy man, but is confronted constantly with vice and disillusionment. He is a weakling -- there is no doubt about this, but his wealth and status make his weakness complicated and endearing.
The music in this movie, and all of Anderson's movies, is as crucial an element as any other. Try imagining Max walking out of the hotel room, having just assaulted Bill Murray with a swarm of bees, with John Williams music playing in the background. Or Max dancing with Olivia Williams with Glenn Miller as the music. It woulndn't work. Both the selected and composed music in Rushmore contribute perfectly throughout.",1015545600,,1597,4.8321167883211675

1021682,2,6305428239,"...I did indeed go and see this film on release with a couple of friends. I made the decision on the basis of great reviews which suggested a cutting edge black comedy, a possible epic and nasty dual between a manic Bill Murray and a devious pupil. I can't tell you what it's like when you're sitting there and after the first ten minutes you know it's not gelling. The laughs aren't coming and you're sinking further into your seat at the embarrassingly twee events unfolding. This is not a guy flick. Unless it's a guy who plays with dolls. The hobbies compendium must have taken a long time to shoot and raises nary a titter. You are aware that one of your friends is a Maori and that they and the English have historically not seen eye to eye. You suggested the film. They paid good money. We rise from our seats at the end and a voice wearily announces with a cold, flat menace: ""Well, that was one that could have waited for the video."" I cringe. Dare I look? Please, not the Maori. I look, and there is no God. As it turns out, the guys were very magnaminous about this friday night debacle at the cinema. Because of my hernia they generously declined to beat me anywhere below the head, touching when considering the apocalyptic averageness of the film.

1021683,5,6305428239,"Stop the counting, ladies and gentlemen.  We have a winner.
""Rushmore"", for me, is 'it'.  Indescribable, indefinable.  The be-all and end-all of movies.  Potissimus membrana*.  It has all my favourite themes: genius, obsession, and loneliness.  And also love, friendship, loyalty, art, commerce, class, sin, redemption, and glory.  All wrapped up in a charming little picaresque about one boy's love for his school.
That boy, Max Fischer, is piquant and palpable but non compos mentis, an intense man stuck in a child's body with a child's immaturity.  He has the energy and determination of ten (nay, hundreds of) men, but lacks the focus to turn this virtue into a viable tool.  The President or founder of several dozen clubs and organizations at Rushmore Academy, Max's horrific grades have him on the verge of expulsion.  Jason Schwartzman, who plays Max with total abandonment of ego and multibrow, captures all of these qualities (features?) without ever breaking a sweat or showing the seams.  He shows Max at his best, and also at his worst, while always making him a character the audience can cheer for.  From an amateur actor, it is by far the best performance I have ever seen.
As Max's mentor and friend, Bill Murray pulls off an unconventional Bill Murray performance.  His steel magnate, Herman Blume, is beaten down by life (read: his shrewish wife and his twin Neanderthal sons), but becomes energized when he meets Max.  Murray plays all his cards close to his chest, exposing the reality within Herman: his loneliness, his sadness, his shyness (Bill Murray playing shy!  Who'd have thought?), but also his concealed vitality.  The relationship between Murray, the seasoned veteran, and Schwartzman, the promising rookie, is volatile and affectionate, without ever being showy.
Olivia Williams, as the object of these two men's affections, is worthy of such.  She plays first grade teacher Rosemary Cross, confused by the adoration she receives, but desperately in need of some.
None of these three are perfect people, and that is why they are perfect for each other.
The supporting cast, notably Seymour Cassell as Max's amiable father, Brian Cox as stern headmaster Dr. Nelson Guggenheim, Mason Gamble as protective chapel partner Dirk Calloway, and Sara Tanaka as prospective love interest Margaret Yang, are all note perfect.  Perfectly cast, perfectly conceived, perfectly executed.  They make Rushmore a real world, and thus ""Rushmore"" becomes real life.
Director Wes Anderson is a persnicketor.  He has chronic meticulosis.  His fastidiophilia is beyond cure.  And for that, I love his work.  If God is in the details, He can surely be found in Anderson's films.  Max's typewriter is emblazoned with the inscription: ""Bravo, Max!  Love, Mom.""  (Key information to add to the melancholy: Mom, who was once terribly supportive, is now dead and gone).  His plays recreate classic movies down to the finest integral elements.  And my favourite: the after party of ""Heaven and Hell"", the Vietnam-era play that closes the film, is dressed up just like an army unit's quarters, complete with bunk beds and nudie pinups.  Anderson frames his shots with the intent of best portraying his characters' humanistic beauty, while composing tableaus to die for made up of colours to warm your toes by.
I wonder if some of the credit for this should go to co-screenwriter Owen Wilson.  The two men have crafted a wonderful story that zips along at a frenetic pace (the first half-hour is so jam-packed with landmark and milestone events that when the title curtain falls for a second time, you realize that we're only in the second month of the school year).  It may look and feel like a typical boy meets girl / boy loses girl / boy tries to get girl back kind of story.  But it's also a Max Fischer kind of story, and that boy certainly doesn't follow formulas.  What a wonderful character Anderson and Wilson have created.  Just his introduction scene alone (""The Hardest Geometry Problem in the World!"") is enough to make you stand up and cheer for this kid, and keep cheering throughout the movie.
Anderson, an acknowledged musicphile, picks just the right pieces for his soundtrack.  John Lennon's song ""Oh Yoko"" scores a scene where Max and Herman try to get their act together for a re-emergence upon the story; it's an odd song choice (unless Max and Herman's unconditional love is meant to be as strong as John and Yoko's was; quite likely) but a right one.  The Who's ""A Quick One While He's Away"" makes a revenge montage sequence all the more frightful, and then poignant when the final refrain comes in (""You are forgiven"").  Obscure Cat Stevens, Rolling Stones, and The Faces (""I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger"") all litter the soundscape in ideal places.  Add to that Mark Mothersbaugh's prodigious and beautiful Renaissance guitar noodling, and this is a film as enticing to listen to, as it is to watch.
I understand that ""Rushmore"", for some, is a taste difficult to acquire.  If you find yourself in that demographic, my sincerest condolences.  If you don't, if you're the type who'll get a lump in your throat at the sight of Max's father, teary-eyed in the audience after Max has paid tribute to his late mother from the lip of the stage, then please make the effort and climb Mount ""Rushmore"".  You'll love the view from the top, I promise.

It takes a somewhat trite `coming of age' story to the next level by incorporating a dry and darkly comic edge, exposing the melancholy behind youthful innocence and hopeless romanticism. This is accomplished primarily through the surreal maturity found in its young characters, but also with the tenderly problematic older ones. Overall, Rushmore dispenses a gloomy charm, as the events of the film constantly teeter over failure, yet remain focused on fanciful dreams of success. The result is the ability of the audience to overlook disappointment and cherish the love of creation: to love the actual process of achievement, no matter how impossible or unattainable the ends may seem. In essence, Rushmore illustrates a new love for life, questioning whether one can ignore consequences in spite of the trivial pursuit of fun and invention. 10/10",978220800,,922,5.321917808219178

Rushmore is the name of a highly prestigious preppy academy.  Max Fischer, wonderfully played by Jason Schwartzman, is a sophomore who dreams of being a scholastic genius, but who has to compensate for his lack of academic capacity by involving himself in extra-curricular activities (or maybe his academic failures can be attributed to his extra-curricular activities).  To list all the clubs that he is a member, president, or founder would easily go over the Amazon.com 1000 word limit, so let's just say that if one can imagine any sort of school or after school activity, Max has done it.  His greatest passion is theater, for which he writes, directs, and acts; the plays he concocts are hilariously extravagant productions, and unfortunately cannot be described without giving away some great moments and visual effects.  Simply put, Max does not believe in half measures.

Max attends Rushmore on a full scholarship provided by Mr. Guggenheim, the principal, but that scholarship is in jeopardy due to his poor grades and extravagant behavior.  To further complicate matters, Max comes from a humble family, his father is a barber, and he feels shame, lying about his family to his friends.

The plot centers around Max and two adults.  Mr. Blume, a steel magnate played by Bill Murray, is rich, but not one who can be considered part of the elite.  He does drive a Rolls Royce, but for him, it might as well have been a Buick.  He drives it everywhere, without care or pride.  He has two annoying, spoiled sons and has been having marital difficulties.  After giving a speech at Rushmore, where his sons attend, Mr. Blume meets Max, and they both become friends - one a precocious child and the other an adult that never really grew up.  The third player of this comedy is Miss Cross, played by Olivia Williams, a new elementary school teacher at Rushmore.  Max falls desperately in love with her, but so does Mr. Blume, and the race is on.

The humor can best be described as oblique.  The situations are funny because they are strange, but they take place in an extremely matter of fact way.  The score enhances this perception by its constant pace.  It is muted, calm, unlike most comedies where the music serves as the laugh track for the movie, and the audience clearly know where they are supposed to laugh by just listening to the crescendos in the score.

The movie raises interesting questions about trust and friendship.  Who are our friends and our enemies, and if trust is broken, can it ever be repaired?  Can one trust in others without trusting in oneself?  The movie takes the audience in a journey of self-discovery, using Max as the little paranoid/compulsive child in all of us, the child that wants to be loved and admired, even though it is painfully aware of its own shortcomings.  The lessons, although sometimes funny, can also hurt.  All in all, it is a satisfying movie that has depth and humor.  There is much to be learned from Max Fischer, and the audience will have a blast while doing so.",972259200,3,3243,4.794594594594595
1021834,5,6305428239,"Directed by Wes Anderson from a script by Anderson and Owen Wilson, Rushmore was an unexpected comedy masterpiece.  Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer, a 10th grade student at Rushmore Academy who is more interested in starting clubs than getting good grades.  Enlisting the aide of the extremely wealthy Mr. Blume (Bill Murray in an award winning performance) in order to impress a first grade teacher, Max unwittingly starts a twisted love triangle.  Bill Murray steals the show, portraying the middle aged-about-to-have-a-breakdown Mr. Blume.  His performance alone is worth the purchase price of this film.  As with Bottle Rocket the humor in Rushmore is done on a thought provoking level, with mild slapstick and witty dialogue.  Being alone, divorce, finding one's niche in life, all of these issues are dealt with carefully and with intelligence.  All in all Rushmore is difficult to explain as to why it works, but it does, and that's all that matters.  ""You just gotta find something you love to do and do it for the rest of your life.""  One of the best films of 1998, and unjustly snubbed by the Motion Picture Academy of America.  This movie should have at least won an Oscar for its script!

Olivia Williams is excellent too -- she was one of the most redeeming features of ""The Postman"", if anyone remembers that movie.  For me, however, Bill Muray steals the show.  Who would have thought, when he was ""Todd"" on Saturday Night Live in 1977, giving Gilda Radner noogies, that he would turn out to be a real actor with actual range, and actual depth?!?!  Well, the man's doing something right, that's all I can say.  Also -- I don't want to give the ending away, but just be somewhat aware, while watching this, that you could construct a pretty strong argument that Max Fischer is just a total jerk.

1021889,5,6305428239,"""Rushmore"" is a new and exciting kind of comedy.  It's a quirky film about teens, but all is not about hormones.  Well, a little is but the  film does it in a very cleaver way.  Most teen films are awful glamour  pictures about beautiful young people and falling in love.  Isn't that  cute?  This film on the other hand is about breaking out and trying to make  something of yourself.  The character of Max Fisher gives you faith in  teens today.
The movie is about a young man named Max Fisher (Jason  Schwartzman) that is in love with his private school Rushmore.  For most  people out in the academy, it's just another part of being rich, but for  innovative Max it's a dream job.  He focuses all of his time on extra  circulars and pet projects like plays (which are often violent but very  poignant).  This kid wrote a one-act play on Watergate before turning 7!  But these activities land him in deep trouble as he begins slipping grade  wise.  Still everything is great as Max not only finds a friend in a wise  but sly steel tycoon (Bill ""The Genius"" Murray) and falls in love  with a charming 1st grade teacher (Olivia Williams).  The friendship with  Herman is a good one, but Rosemary is not as impressed with the ideal of  romance with a 15-year-old.  One of the keys to impressing her is getting  Latin not only reinstated, but required!  It's the mind in action, and it's  a sight to behold. The fun doesn't last forever as soon Miss Cross realizes  the young man is falling in love with her.  If it takes his mind and  Herman's money to get her, Fisher it up to it.
A new twist on the  ""teen"" movie is the smart and calculated hero that isn't perfect.  Max is not the richest kid by any means and is not easily liked.  He  manages to be appreciated for his talents and not his good looks or  something artificial.  Also fascinating is the fact that Max has a good  relationship with his hapless father.  Max shockingly doesn't really trick  his father but just uses him in the lot in the film.  He doesn't view him  as a threat at all while other teen movies have parents that are cunning  and to ready to punish their kids. Here it is dad that treats his child  extremely well, but won't dare try to restrict him.  Maybe this is wise, as  we see Max fall in his face but indeed learn from his mistakes.  Anyway, I  just thought it was worth noting the stellar performance of Seymour Class,  that is all.
  I don't want to give too much of this superior script away  but at some point Herman and Max do become enemies and then friend's again.  It's speculator the chemistry the two have as a comic team.  They are just  too ingenious for words, yet it is this cleaver dialogue that brings them  to life.  This film is superb in comic timing not to mention some emotional  moments.  It's a light-hearted but very smart movie with a few really big  twists and turns that no one suspects.  For many reasons, it's an excellent  film, from introducing Jason Schwartzman as a geeky but cutting edge kid to  being a great welcome back to Bill Murphy.  While Murray is always a comic  master, it had been while since he had done anything so this is a great way  to introduce him into a new generation.  His performance as a gloomy  millionaire trying to figure out life while having to put up with a  cheating wife and two obnoxious twins that he really doesn't relate to is  more than Oscar worthy.  If this is the last film he stars in (or last  notable one), it will be a great way to seal his career.  But please do  more, Mr. Murray.  You're the best.",966729600,5,3563,4.346625766871166

1021895,3,6305428239,"I don't know what I expected out of ""Rushmore"", a quirky,  offbeat film written and directed by Wes Anderson (""Bottle  Rocket"").  I seemed to recall some buzz regarding the movie and that  it won a couple prizes at last year's Independent Spirit Awards.  I can  report, though, that ""Rushmore"" pleasantly surprised  me.
Newcomer Jason Schwartzman stars as Max Fischer, an oddly mature  15-year-old who goes to Rushmore Academy, which is ""one of the best  schools in the country.""  Max (who always sports a blue blazer and  tie) is extremely active in many - if not most - of the school's clubs.  He's a little too active, however, and is facing expulsion because of  ""too many extracurricular activities.""  Max is into everything it  seems, so much so that a wealthy steel tycoon, Mr. Bloom (Bill Murray in  yet another terrific supporting role) comments to the headmaster Dr.  Guggenheim that Max seems ""to have it pretty figured out.""
That is until he falls for a pretty teacher.  When their friendship  starts to become more in his mind, she quickly cuts him off.  And then the  movie takes an unusual turn.  Max's friend Mr. Bloom falls for her too.  The romantic triangle that follows is strange until you realize that Max  and Mr. Bloom aren't so different as you might imagine.
Two films came  to my mind as I watched ""Rushmore"".  The movie reminded me of  ""The Graduate"" and ""Harold and Maude"" (two terrific  films by the way).  I think you'll be able to see the similarity to  ""The Graduate"" right away, but if you doubt me on the other one,  remember this - both ""Harold and Maude"" and ""Rushmore""  feature Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack.  I don't think  ""Rushmore"" is as good as those other movies, however, but the  fact that it earns comparison says a lot.",962668800,,1773,4.683006535947713

Jason Schwartzman played a fifteen year old egotistical snot who was  failing his academic courses at the prestigious Rushmore High School.  He  was involved in all kinds of extra-curricular activities, but he just  couldn't make the grade as far as science, history, etc.  Instead of being  a nice person, he has to be an obnoxious son of a gun just because he  doesn't get his way.
When confronted by an equally obnoxious Scotsman,  Jason quickly states that he did ugly things to his little best friend's  mother.
Then Bill Murray, a married man, cheats on his wife with the best  friend's mother, and that made me not like HIM very much.

There were not too many  extras -- all it had were the trailer and recommended film section which  quite frankly, was hokey (stillshot of 3 movie boxes).  The advantages of  DVD with all the extras beyond subtitling and extra trailer were lost on  this copy.  An example would be the fact that Rushmore has a *sweet*  soundtrack but no advantage was derived such as a seperate soundtrack  section with lyrics or contact info for the bands (lost marketing  opportunity there).

1021958,5,6305428239,"There is something amazing about films written and directed by the same  individual, as is the case with Rushmore(co-written by Owen Wilson, now  curiously enough appearing in Shanghai Noon), a certain understanding of  characters and situations and attention to details that may be overlooked  in other filmic circumstances. I found this film amazing in the details.  Sure the basic plot is compelling enough but a much shabbier movie could  have been hung on it. I am continually amused by this film: Bill Murray  wearing Budweiser swimming trunks, carrying his scotch and cigarette up to  the diving board, tripping over fences, smoking and drinking hotel minibar  rum and diet coke in a hospital elevator, by Max's green suit and bowtie,  Yves Montand cassetes, Dirk's malapropism, Serpico, the crazy lookin'  nameless kid who shows up in a lot of scenes and at the bottom of the pool  like a crazy little elf with huge eyes; all of these little quirky details  are surreal in their appropriateness and show the work of minds critically  attuned to minute observations that are somehow familiar and otherworldly.  Jason Schwartzman is such a find(though he's hardly a ""find""  being part of the Coppola royal family). I can't wait to see him in  something else if he can ever find time to tear himself away from his band  Phantom Planet.

This included such films as the rather dull Cruel Intentions and the frankly dire American Pie. I admit  I am usually hard to please, so at the end of my tether this would need to  be superb to return my faith in the Amercian movie industry.
I was not  disappointed. This was an absolute gem of a movie - perfect in execution,  consistently witty, often moving, and always thoroughly enjoyable. I rarely  watch a film again immediately after finishing it. This film, I watched  three times over the two days I rented it.
The acting was spot on. The  love-struck,geeky, selfish - yet strangley likeable hero, Max, was played  to perfection by Schwartzman, and Bill Murray gave a wonderfully  underplayed performance as the lonely, sullen, somewhat lost businessman  who befreinds Max. Williams turns in a great performance as the  love-interest, and though still a slightly stereotyped Englishwoman, in  Rushmore Williams makes it somehow more charming than annoying. The  soundtrack is also perfectly matched to the movie. I always believe a good  soundtrack adds depth to a movie - hightens your emotions, and Lennon,  Stevens and co. do just that.
When this film finished you knew it was a  classic. From start to finish it is perfectly executed, avoiding cheesy  moments, and constantly enthralling. Perhaps most strangely, it is not  necessarily a new plot idea, its just been done here so well, that it  deserves a place among the finest movies of the last few years.

He does not get sent to a work camp for juvenile offenders (though he spends a  short time in jail). He lives with a loving father. And where Antoine is  helpless in a world run by hapless adults, Max is a precocious youth who  has firmly established himself in, at least some aspects, the adult world.

They are both  misunderstood and at odds with ""the establishment"".  They are  both vital and active children who search for something to live for.  And  they both look to the adult world to answer their innermost yearnings, and  come back disappointed and rejected.
Rushmore, like The 400 Blows, has  a magic quality to it.  Whether it is the catchy soundtrack; the  rebelliouly charming, somewhat anachronistic 60's quality of Max; the  quaint, quiet, enlightened, and tolerant town of Rushmore; or the wonderful  supporting characters like Mr. Littlejeans, Dirk, Margaret Yang, and Max's  haircutting father--the film conveys a real sense of the subtle,  understated beauty hidden amid all of the irritation, brilliance, and  activity that exudes from the film.

He does not get sent to a work camp for juvenile offenders (though he spends a  short time in jail). He lives with a loving father. And where Antoine is  helpless in a world run by hapless adults, Max is a precocious youth who  has firmly established himself in, at least some aspects, the adult world.
On the other hand there are several very salient affinities between the  two.  They are both brilliantly intelligent and creative.  They are both  misunderstood and at odds with ""the establishment"".  They are  both vital and active children who search for something to live for.  And  they both look to the adult world to answer their innermost yearnings, and  come back disappointed and rejected.
Rushmore, like The 400 Blows, has  a magic quality to it.  Whether it is the catchy soundtrack; the  rebelliouly charming, somewhat anachronistic 60's quality of Max; the  quaint, quiet, enlightened, and tolerant town of Rushmore; or the wonderful  supporting characters like Mr. Littlejeans, Dirk, Margaret Yang, and Max's  haircutting father--the film conveys a real sense of the subtle,  understated beauty hidden amid all of the irritation, brilliance, and  activity that exudes from the film.

But it's a black comedy.  And you might not like it.  You need to be able to be a bit mean yourself to love it, and you also need to be a bit mooshy deep down inside to get it.
OK,  my thoughts: this film, much like the wonderful ""Welcome to the  Dollhouse,"" is based on a certain embarassment factor.  We have our  unassailable hero, Max -- played wonderfully and fearlessly by Jason  Schwartzman -- who is everything a Hollywood smarty-pants in high school  movies should be: over-zealous, arrogant, lazy, manipulative, asthmatic,  etc.  He is both awful and wonderful to watch because all you can do is  wait for his brilliant, ill-planned schemes to fail.
And they have to  fail in order to make this movie more than a teen-angst 90's ""Pretty  in Pink.""  And when they fail, of course you must feel awful about the  whole thing, despite your former cringing.
Just as surely as Max must be  cringe-inducing, Bill Murray must be even more so.  He is just wonderful as  the awful, broken mentor and rival of our hero, Max.
So basically the  story is about 2 utter losers who behave nastily during a significant  portion of the film.  And it's really funny.  And you come to like the  characters for their flaws, and see some very weird parts of yourself in  them.  But it is also one of those films that sneaks up on you while you're  laughing and has a philosophical point.
And that's a sign of a fine,  fine movie.

Having attended a private school for part of my education and known people who've gone to male-only, private schools, the film stylishly captures the mix of geekdom, male social  codes/rituals, RAMPANT egomania, and most of all, unique comraderie that's  unique to such institutions.  It's satire, but a warm, nostalgic  satire.

 This flick also works as a private school version of The  Simpsons.  Yes, Max Fisher is really another version of Bart Simpson, that  mix of wiser-than-his-time, can-do chutzpah, and adolescence, which all  comes apart when he falls for 1st teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams.)  As in the cartoon Montegomary Burns is what Bart may be if he loses his  heart, Bill Murray is what Max may become if he succombs to bitterness.  This also becomes a source of an endearing rivalry and friendship between  Bill and Max, and all of a sudden you have a honest, sometimes dark,  sometimes touching look at human relationships.

 More than a  coming-of-age story, it's a story about the weird people we meet and the  weirder (and special) friendships we get from them.  Hands down, the film  of '98 and really one of the best comedies of this decade.",936489600,,1215,4.97

1022448,1,6305428239,Really disappointing. Bill Murray is wasted here. I only laughed because I thought I was supposed to laugh. I did like Max's quirkyness but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I feel cheated out of $30.00. My best  advice is to rent before you buy.,930700800,6,256,4.333333333333333

1022500,5,6305428239,"Amazing and fun, but has the heart of any great film.  It is done very well and we really learn something about the characters.  Every times I watch it I still get a tear in my eye.  Enjoy it!",930441600,,192,3.871794871794872
1022501,5,6305428239,"Rushmore was such a wonderful movie, though I might be a bit biased since it was filmed at my high school, the same high school Wes Anderson attended. It had a wonderful plot, and far surpassed the usual box office  hit.",930441600,,220,4.365853658536586

7888808,5,6305428239,Favorite movie of all time.  Probably because I first saw it when I was 15 years old and a terrible underachiever at a fancy boarding school.,1524528000,,141,4.423076923076923
7888809,4,6305428239,"Very good early Anderson movie. Sometimes I prefer the simpler striped down style of his earlier work, but Life Aquatic remains my favorite.",1523145600,,140,5.130434782608695
7888810,5,6305428239,It's the story of a psychopath that slowly turns into a decent human. I appreciate that every bad thing he did backfired.,1522368000,,121,4.545454545454546
7888811,5,6305428239,Very funny movie.  Dont know how I missed it back in 1998.,1521244800,,58,3.8333333333333335
7888812,4,6305428239,"Wes Anderson proves once again, why he is so original and so irreverent with every artistic proposela he underatkes.

Rushmore bets for challenging the rules, in the line of Einstein's quote: ""The imagination is more important than knowledge"". A smart guy becomes a multidimensional leader in many disciplines. And that's the main reason he will become a pain for many.

So, when he arrives a new school he will pave the way (With a little help of his beloved sentimental contrary) a modest project to enhance the limits of knowledge.

Despite the film approaches to end, the script experiments a certain weakness, the narrative structure is formidable. The several intersections and twists of fate will make you think, far beyond the easy laughs.

Watch one of the main cult movies of the nineties!!!

And kudos for Wes!",1520812800,,821,4.963503649635037
7888813,5,6305428239,"Wes Anderson at his finest, as usual.  Phenomenal cast starting, Schwarzman totally nails this role and steals the show.  If you have not seen his other flicks, like The Royal Tenenbaums, the Grand Budapest Hotel, do check them out.",1520294400,,232,4.923076923076923
