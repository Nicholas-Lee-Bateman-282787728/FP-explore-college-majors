7607635,5,B01AP0ASG0,As giant Kenndy fan this was a great addition to my collection of JFK DVDs. Candid not often seen footage of a great president.,1472774400,,127,4.333333333333333
7607636,5,B01AP0ASG0,"The film Crisis is the knock-out tour-de-force in this collection IMHO. The film Primary is famous for being the first film of this kind. If you want to really blow your mind about what is possible in a documentary I would say to get this and watch Crisis and you will know why people have been talking about these films since the 1960s. There were no films being made like this at the time. If you are into the history of documentary and you have not seen Primary, your peers will look at you cross eyed. This DVD also includes never-before released footage from inside the Kennedy White House and Robert Kennedy.",1471910400,3,614,4.491071428571429

7607638,5,B01AP0ASG0,"An absolutely brilliant Blu-Ray. The films of Robert Drew and Associates on Kennedy provide a valuable and historical
look at the last best president our country has had. The cinematic techniques used to gather footage were groundbreaking and provided
a live feel to what was being filmed and recorded.
The extras on this release are quite good also.
A must have for documentarians and admirers of the Kennedy administration.",1470096000,4,425,5.173913043478261
7607639,5,B01AP0ASG0,"The four documentaries assembled in this Criterion release are all essential viewing for anyone interested in the Kennedy political dynasty. John and Robert Kennedy look like rock stars in these movies, and one gets a peek into their roles as President, and Attorney General, respectively.

Primary is the most entertaining film, and contains some very funny footage about life on the campaign trail. I had no idea, for example, that campaigns had their own songs people would sing at events.

Adventures on the New Frontier in my opinion is the weakest of the group. However, it has some heartbreaking footage of my home state of West Virginia, and the struggles of the people there. Surprisingly, this documentary has little footage of John Kennedy. The first ten minutes recycle a great amount of footage from Primary.

The third is the best film, in my opinion. It's Crisis, which is the narrative about integration of the University of Alabama. The story plays out like a feature film, with the characters introduced in the beginning and the camera follows each of them through the course of the film. Also, the movie has a spectacular amount of footage of Bobby Kennedy, and also insight into George Wallace.

The final film is Faces of November. It's a short about the funeral of President Kennedy. The most powerful image is the look on the face of Jackie Kennedy, who looks so different from only a few years before, in Primary.

This set is just spectacular.",1469664000,8,1468,4.879518072289157

7607642,4,B01AP0ASG0,Took me back to that time. I felt that it recaptured the experience of that time in a way that historical documentaries can't.,1466380800,4,126,4.521739130434782
7607643,1,B01AP0ASG0,Unfortunately I would like to give it no stars because the disk would not play on my dvd player and I had to return it for a refund.,1464998400,,132,3.75
8747955,5,B01AP0ASG0,"I've been a follower of JFK and have known about him since I was a young man growing up in the 1970s. I have several documentaries on him, some from the History Channel, some from Millcreek. This one is another one to add to the library.
There are 4 films here in all from Robert Drew. All in black and white, but they all look really good now when played back on an Ultra 4K player with the same type of TV.
I had not seen any of these here, but after watching them in succession, I now have a better understanding of what some of the things former President Kennedy did and had to go through in his short time as our President.
If you are a follower of JFK or just want to know more about him during his campaign run for President during the Primary and after he became President, I highly recommend this to you.
** Package, disc and graphics are well done. Another win for Criterion..",1531785600,,887,4.192982456140351

8747957,5,B01AP0ASG0,Once again Criterion puts together yet another fine package for a film and/or film series. I have been purchasing Criterion items back in the 1990s when Laser discs were still the best-to-date media delivery system and in the great LP size and some time gate-fold option packages. Always pricey but well worth it.  I have been a Kennedy fan back to the 80s and these films taken before and after Kennedys assertion to the Presidency by a Manhattan ad agency (probably the best/cool job either represented by 60s TV shows and now MAD MEN) truly captures the times and the energy of the moment. Great addition to anyones collection.,1511568000,,630,4.779816513761468

8747959,5,B01AP0ASG0,"The best study of any historical subject is to source primary documents and or contemporary audio/visual from the time. Through Robert Drew's short documentaries an ""up close and personal"" and relatively  uncensored unscripted glimpse is allowed into President Kennedy's personality, his team, and the background to interesting historical events between 1960-63. One anecdote is that the normally media savvy, confident, JFK who is rarely flummoxed, looks startled in his rocking chair in the oval office, for one second, when his brother Bobby suggests that the President go on television that night (June 1963) to give a speech in defence of civil rights for African Americans. The speech was given and is one of JFK's finest and most noble. No plastic spin-driven politician here - just raw unfettered filming of an American leader we have never seen the likes of since (sadly).",1495238400,3,881,5.24822695035461
