People in a theater watch six dancing girls on the stage, and the other act. Sheriff Kens thinking about quitting and buying a ranch. His twin brother Clem runs a store. They want to lock up money in the safe overnight. After they leave a man asks Clem to open the safe so he can steal the money. They telephone the Sheriff with a false report to draw him out of town. Sheriff Ken gathers men to ride to that ranch where they learn of the trick. They race back to town, the robbers start shooting at them. The robbers tear up the floorboards to escape. Ken and the others fight the fire with buckets of water.

Men pump to build water pressure. They discover Clem tied up in the back room. Ken promises to hunt for the robbers in the morning. But others want a new Sheriff. Ken is arrested and jailed! Clem meets Mary and asks her to go away with him. Then he says Ken is hurt and wants Mary. The robbers reach their hideout and split the loot. Clem arrives to get his share, but is disappointed. In town Ken cuts the ropes to free himself. Clem puts a note on Kens horse, who opens the gates to return to town.

Ken disguises himself as Charley to sing about a bird in a gilded cage. Ken is recognized but makes his escape! Rawhide tells Mary to get some sleep, she will be guarded. When Clem gets out of his chair he is stopped! Kens trick riding skills allows him to evade the armed guard by the robbers hideout. Mary plays the organ, this draws Ken to the cabin. Ken fights Rawhide while Mary plays loudly. Then they escape with the money. There is shooting. Can Clem stop the robbers by himself? The townsmen arrive, Ken returns the money. He and Mary will continue to ride together.

Ken Maynard joined a Wild West Show in his teens and became a trick rider. He shows his horsemanship skills in this and other movies. Ken plays two roles as two different characters and performs well. The vigorous fight scenes are a feature in this and other movies. Kens movies are generally better than average.",1509494400,,2034,4.330708661417323
8064245,3,B0009OL95W,"Ken Maynard was at the peak of his film career from 1933 to 1934 when Universal brought him in to replace the retired Tom Mix.  Maynard was given his own unit and a great deal of control over how the film's were made.  This is evident in this film by Maynard's duel role as the heroism sheriff Ken and his weak brother Clem.  The duel role of the strong and weak brother was a favorite of Maynard, and although he does well as the stalwart hero, his performance as Clem, the weak willed store keeper who betrays Ken could be best described as on the bizarre side.  Maynard also performs a song and dance number, in disguise,  singing ""She's Only A Bird In A Gilded Cage"", also an exercise in weirdness.  Can't recall any other cowboy hero resorting to a soft shoe number!  Fred Kohler plays the chief heavy so convincingly that he must had held a patent on this type of role.  Celia Parker plays the female lead, but frankly Maynard displays more chemistry with his horse Tarzan.  The production values are solid and up to the standard set by the Mix series, and Ken, although visibility over weight,  photographs well, especially while on horseback.  The only real objection I had with this film was the poor print, with strings showing up across the image all through the film.  Also, the print is grainy and dark, and since much of the action takes place at night, including a roof top chase scene, this was pretty frustrating.
From everything I've read, Ken Maynard was a despicable human being, a violent, drunken ego maniac who eventually destroyed himself through alcoholism and  temprement.  Despite his many flaws of character,  he was an innovative film maker and is deservedly remembered as one of the great movie cowyboys.",1506211200,,1734,4.657894736842105

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse.

Our story line and plot, After Sheriff Ken (Ken Maynard) puts money in the safe, his brother Clem (Ken Maynard) gives Rawhide (Fred Kohler) the combination. With the money gone the disgruntled townsmen make Boots Sheriff (Frank Hagney) and lock up Ken --- Clem, now a prisoner of Rawhide, has a change of heart and sends Ken a message with the outlaw's location --- Ken escapes by impersonating the saloon entertainer and rides for the hangout --- This rather grim Universal film is notable for Ken Maynard's portrayal of two characters: one his usual heroic self, and the other a shy, sneaking, yet ultimately honorable fellow. This film is considerably darker than most of his efforts, and shows the off-beat star's versatility.

But, in this film, in what sounds like his natural voice, he sings ""She Was Only a Bird In a Gilded Cage,"" while disguised, and...does a dance to the song as well with some chorus girls, but it does work! So glad Maynard shared all these elements of his talent, if only he would have kept that temper in line --- Well worth your time. The singing, dancing and disguise are priceless, especially if you know what a complex character Maynard was.

Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.

8064247,3,B0009OL95W,"Ken Maynard did not make traditional Westerns for Universal - in fact, he frequently clashed with studio bosses over the bizarre nature of his storylines. ""Honor of the Range"" (1934) has Ken in a dual role as the town sheriff and his weak-willed twin brother. Good stunt work and solid Universal production  values make this one of Maynard's better efforts. However, if you want to see the cowboy star at his most outlandish, check out ""Smoking Guns.""",1158105600,5,451,4.857142857142857
