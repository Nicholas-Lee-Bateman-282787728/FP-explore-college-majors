8119752,1,B000FAB5L8,I bought these DVD's because I thought they would be a great workout. The quality of the workout is terrible. There was no cool down to the workout. It seemed to just be two girlfriends who wanted to workout together poolside and decided to record it and sell it. The video spends most of the time zoomed in on the womans face and you usually cannot see what she is doing. Then there is no transition to the next workout. She is already in position and doing what you are supposed to be doing. Her explanations are minimal and since the video is zoomed in on her face you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing. This DVD was a waste of money. I am sure there are better Pilates DVD's out there.,1295136000,,702,4.169117647058823
8119753,5,B000FAB5L8,"I had never done Pilates before but was curious because I heard several of my friends talking about it.  I found this two-pack in the $5.50 bin at Wal*Mart and decided to give them a try.  I loved them.  I love the beach setting; it's so relaxing.  The instructors are so personal, like they're really interacting with you.  These videos really helped me to tone up and strengthen my entire body!  Now if only I can find a pre-natal Pilates routine that's as good.

I def. recommend it!",1171584000,,486,4.454545454545454
