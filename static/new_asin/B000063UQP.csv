1691694,5,B000063UQP,"This is a true drama.  At times it is very painful.  I suppose a modern viewer may find the movie a bit slow moving.  To me this is film making art at its finest.  For the ardent student of Hollywood history, this film is a true ""must see"".

This film made me a permanent fan of Anthony Quinn.  I almost do not know how a role could have been performed better.  Jackie Gleason was also very good.  As a child, I saw Jackie Gleason as a comedic buffoon..  I had no idea what a fine dramatic actor he was.

I saw the movie in its full length.  I keep seeing that the DVD is edited.  I have no idea why this would be done.  Occasionally I see a shortened version of great books.  I always opt for the full length version whenever I can.  Recently I tried to rent this on TCM and the runnng time was 85 minutes.  I believe that is the edited version.  The original running time was more like and hour and a half.  Thank You...",1478736000,,922,4.027777777777778

1691736,5,B000063UQP,"Staggering performance by Anthony Quinn as washed-up fighter Mountain Rivera. As in Lawrence of Arabia, Quinn's appearance is so dramatically altered that it is hard to believe that this is actually Quinn. His performance is absolutely seamless -- there is not a dishonest moment. Quinn is matched by Jackie Gleason, proving that he was as great a dramatic actor as he was a comedian. Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris also do some of their best work. The scenes with Quinn and Harris are magical. It is difficult to watch this film because the characters are all such losers but Rod Serling's masterpiece grabs you and doesn't let go.

Great performances by Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris.  At least they left the stairwell scene between Gleason and Harris.  This was the type of scene she always excelled at.  The storyline is about a former great boxer, now used as cannon fodder, losing a fight and being told his boxing career is over and he has to find something else.  Quinn does a great job.  Gleason is the manager who owes money to thugs and is willing to throw his fighter under the bus to save himself.  Rooney plays his trainer and friend who really cares about him.

1691740,3,B000063UQP,"Rod Serling's REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (1962), stars Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris. The four principals are excellent, especially Quinn, who as Mountain Rivera seems to be channeling a punchier version of Rocky Graziano.

The story's been done before, but this take has an odd and most sad ending. Gleason is Maish Rennick, Rivera's friend and manager of 17 years. A decade ago, his boxer was 5th ranked in the heavyweight division but now it's clear Rivera is washed up. Before his next fight with young Cassius Clay, Maish lays a $1500 bet that Rivera won't make it out of the 4th round. He convinces Ma Greeney (Madame Spivey), an odd semi-crossdressing underworld figure, to also bet the same way. But Rivera does the impossible: he lasts 7 rounds against Clay.

Knocked out, beaten to a pulp, a ring doctor tells Rivera he's finished as a fighter. Bad timing, for without his third of Rivera's earnings, Maish has no way to pay Ma the $1500 he owes, plus she's demanding he cover the thousands she lost on Rivera. Failure to raise the cash means Ma's goons will kill Maish...

The opening sequence is this picture's most artistically creative. The camera, and us by extension, is Rivera in the ring against Clay, who closes in and throws punishing combinations until everything goes out of focus, then black.

This COLUMBIA Pictures dub offers the option of wide or full screen versions. The image is flawless; audio's clear but low in volume. No extras beyond subtitles and chapter stops. As already mentioned here, there's at least ten minutes of story missing. The DVD clocks in at 85:09; COLUMBIA exaggerates it to ""Approx. 88 Minutes,"" while IMDb says 96 minutes is correct.

1691765,3,B000063UQP,"Requiem for a Heavyweight, 1962 film

The story starts in a boxing ring. One boxer is knocked down, he needs help going back to his dressing room. Mountain Rivera is examined by a doctor. Sclerotic damage to his left eye; his days in boxing are over after 17 years. His manager will need a new fighter. What do I do now? You cant fight anymore. [Note all the men wear hats.] The manager runs away from men who follow him, but is trapped in an empty auditorium. Maysh explains what happened, but he must come up with the bundle by the first of the month (gambling debt). [Remember those dial-up pay telephones?] Rivera goes to the Unemployment Office for an interview. He talks about his near greatness: #5 in 1952. Rivera walks about the streets at night. [Anyone recognize that neighborhood?] The manager and the trainer play cars. Thats good to know.

Can Rivera go into wrestling? [Is this a step down?] Who owes who? Maysh gets his suitcase. A telephone call reminds him of his debt. Rivera meets that woman from the Unemployment Office, she talks about a job opportunity. They have a beer. Rivera talks about his past; others watch him. Can Rivera work with children? [Is this joke?] Mr. Perelli has an offer for wrestling. Rivera goes to a meeting at a hotel. Rivera will work as a wrestler. Its what Maysh wants. We see midget wrestlers in a ring. Rivera wears a wig with pigtails, but he is reluctant to play his part. Maysh slips in admitting he bet against Rivera! Rivera is now ashamed. A gangster arrives to order things. Rivera will wrestle. Maysh will get a new fighter. We see the actions of the audience towards Rivera. Rivera adapts to his new career.

What happens to actors or sports players who age out? James Michener wrote Sports in America on the usefulness of sports for some people. The wealthy don't go into the sports business. Working as an accountant would be better for most. This story can symbolize other areas, like the small businesses that were being taken over by big corporations or going bankrupt. How many local businesses from the 1950s are still around today? This movie provides a look at the culture of the 1950s. Note how their talk is restrained. The fighter who has 1000% faith in his manager could be a criticism of the I Like Ike generation. This was first written in 1956 by Rod Serling.",1389484800,,2336,4.597122302158273
1691766,5,B000063UQP,"Perhaps Rod Serling's greatest gift as a writer was his ability to take the reader or viewer into a world unknown to them and make them feel comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. Comfortable in understanding that world by the details Serling provides but appalled by the inner motivations that rule there. In Requiem for a Heavyweight he takes a harsh look at the unforgiving world of professional boxing.
Anthony Quinn is a fading heavyweight who gets beaten senseless by Cassius Clay in the opening sequence. Jackie Gleason is his manager and Mickey Rooney his trainer and cut man who tries to help both inner and outer wounds heal. Julie Harris is a social worker who goes the extra mile to help Quinn after he is forced to quit the ring due to injuries.
Serling slowly weaves the quartet's fears, hopes, dreams, and desires into an interplay of emotions that explodes at just the right moments. Lurking in the background are a female gambler and unscrupulous wrestling promoter waiting to take a piece of the action any way possible.
The last sequence in which one of the four loses his friends, another his self-respect out of loyalty to the one who betrayed him, and a third his faith in his fellow man is among the best in cinema history.",1389398400,,1255,4.709090909090909

1691768,4,B000063UQP,"I agree with the other commentators about the absence of certain sections that were in the theatrical release of this superb movie.  Something this good needs to be seen out there as it was originally constituted.  And certainly there must have been trailers for the actual film: this DVD has trailers for The Greatest (a movie with and about Muhammed Ali) and Barrabas (Quinn's Jesus movie turn).  Who needs to see those?  I watched it last night and admired the restoration work--the gritty, down-and-out atmosphere (check out the presence of smoky mirrors throughout the movie)--that really brings out the brutal realities.  The movie is part and parcel of the social realism trend in the 1960s that showed up in films like The Hustler and Days of Wine and Roses.  Special mention to Jackie Gleason, who was highly underrated as a serious actor, and no matter what you think of Mickey Rooney's checkered career, all is forgiven after watching him depict Army so poignantly.  Quinn once said this was his favorite role in a long and varied career.  And the recently deceased Julie Harris also essays a role that required great nuance to bring off.  And let's not forget the woman who portrays the macho ""Ma"" (I'm also certain one deleted scene has maybe Gleason revealing that she is a woman)--the epitome of back-alley evil. The introduction of pro wrestling into the mix was totally inspired, especially with the exploited midgets.  Rod Serling himself was a great American writer and must never be dismissed as simply ""that guy in the Twilight Zone.""  He's created another kind of Twilight Zone in this movie that, edited or not, cannot be denied.",1380153600,,1652,4.906474820143885
1691769,4,B000063UQP,what do you do?  This boxer clearly wasn't good at much of anything else.  Now a doctor has made the decision to shut him down.

I expect stellar from Anthony Quinn and was not disappointed; his portrayal of prize-fighter Mountain Rivera develops depth as the film progresses; big surprise for me in this film was Jackie Gleason playing Rivera's smarmy underhanded fight manager, and Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris as support for Rivera through his career changes.

1691790,5,B000063UQP,"Reminiscent of Darren Aronofsky's `The Wrestler' (or I should probably say that that's the other way around), `Requiem for a Heavyweight' is a dark and moving film about the price one pays in a particular field and the overwhelming destitution one can suffer when their run of luck is officially over.

It's bleak, but hugely impactful.

The film centers around a heavyweight prize fighter named Louis Rivera.  It opens on the eve of his final fight.  A couple too many blows to the face and the doctor advises him to never fight again.  One more punch and he could wind up dead.  His trainer is insistent that he heed that advice, but his manager and supposed friend Maish needs him to fight, somehow, in order to pay back a gambling debt to the heinous Ma Greeny.  Louis, in search of other work, comes across Grace Miller at a temp agency.  She takes a shine to him and wants to help him take his life in a different direction.  Sadly, her attempts are met with Maish's influence and he does not want her to succeed.

The film is filled with brilliant moments that all add up to one beautifully effective film.  As some have already mentioned, the stairway confrontation between Maish and Grace is one of the greatest moments in screen history.  It is brilliantly acted and conveys the heart of the film with such urgency.  The final frame, that depiction of Louis's eventualities, is heartbreaking in its ability to convey the destitution and apparent hopelessness of his character.

Sadly, this film has apparently been butchered.

I'm saying this based on the word of others, since I have ONLY seen this version, but apparently there are important scenes that have been omitted from this finished product.  I still give THIS film five stars, but I possibly wouldn't have had I actually seen the original and found it far superior.  I'm saddened that the scenes previously in the film that have apparently been deleted are not offered here on the DVD as a bonus feature.  I now feel as though I have been gypped and truly wish to see this film in its entirety.  I mean, I don't even know what I'm missing, and I miss it so much!

A major plus here is the acting from the entire cast.  I mean, how they all missed out on Oscar recognition is beyond me.  Mickey Rooney, who is often remembered for his hammed up breed of comedy, delivers such a raw and emotionally heavy performance as Army, Louis's sad trainer, and Jackie Gleason is perfectly layered as the conflicted and somewhat corrupt Maish.  Julie Harris is beautifully invested as Grace, serving as the moral epicenter of the film, and Anthony Quinn handles Louis with pitch perfect realism; giving him a soul instead of a gimmick.  Not to mention director Ralph Nelson's commendable handling of atmosphere, which created such a rich portrait of the downtrodden.

Aces; this film is just aces!",1346112000,,2855,4.696177062374246

1691792,3,B000063UQP,Kudos to Amazon for their fast service. Customers should be aware that there are several scenes from the original movie that are missing on this DVD. This is one of my favorite movies that I've seen at least half a dozen times before. An example is the one where they are trying to teach Mountain how to wrestle and he keeps losing his cool and punching the other wrestler. Another is where Maish confronts Ma Greeny and tell her he wishes she wasn't a woman and she retorts that's the nicest thing anyone ever said to her. There is no reason for leaving them out and there is no notice that the film was edited for content. The movie rates 5 stars but the DVD only 3 for cutting corners.,1285459200,,688,4.3
1691793,5,B000063UQP,"Interesting drama I remember from my youth. Well played by Anthony Quinn and Jackie Gleason.

1691794,5,B000063UQP,"This movie, which concerns a boxer, was written by Rod Serling, famed writer of most of the black and white TWILIGHT ZONE television shows.  The best of these TWILIGHT ZONE stories include, e.g., TO SERVE MAN, CAVENDER IS COMING, STEEL, A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY, NIGHT CALL, THE BIG TALL WISH, WHAT'S IN THE BOX, and KICK THE CAN.  Of these, THE BIG TALL WISH and STEEL are about boxing.  THE BIG TALL WISH was written by Mr. Serling, but STEEL was written by Richard Matheson.

In a nutshell, Anthony Quinn has been a successful heavyweight boxer for some 17 years.  However, a physician informs him that he is suffering from eye damage, and must quit boxing or else go blind.  Anthony Quinn agrees to quit, and goes to an employment agency, and meets young Julie Harris, a career counselor.  After a few missteps (she inadvertently tells him that he has ""problems"" similar to those of a returning war veteran), she suggests the career of athletic coach for boys.  Anthony Quinn impulsively takes a liking to this, but he is not really compatible with this sort of job.  One reason Anthony Quinn is not really compatible with a job as an athletic coach is that he prefers bars to boys.

Jackie Gleason, who is Anthony Quinn's manager, makes certain that Anthony Quinn flunks his interview for the atheletic coach job, by taking Anthony Quinn drinking at popular bar immediately before the interview. Throughout the movie, Jackie Gleason steers Anthony Quinn towards a new career as a wrestler, in part, because Jackie Gleason needs to pay a huge gambling debt.  A wrestling career is initially seen as a humiliation by Anthony Quinn, for example, because he has to dress up as an Indian chief and wear a headdress of feathers.  But a number of factors persuade him to agree to be a wrestler and that is how the movie ends, that is, by him accepting his new career move.

Actor Stan Adams plays ""Perelli,"" a sleazy wrestling promoter.  The experience of seeing this particular sleazy character, alone, is worth the price of buying this film.  One wishes for days long past, before the public's interest in computer graphics technology replaced the public's interest for interesting character actors.

This movie is much, much more than simply an amusing ""plot"" or a ""storyline.""  What the movie is really about his how a person's motivations rise and fall, what provokes shifts of one's motivations, and what makes one person faithful towards another person throughout life's journeys.

There are also plenty of treats-for-the-eye in this movie.  We see the real Cassius Clay, playing the part of a triumphant boxer at the start of the movie.  We see a half dozen dwarves, in the boxing ring towards the end of the movie.  We see a female gangster (Ma Greeny), putting the screws on Jackie Gleason.  Another interesting female gangster can be found on the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, in the episode called, ""BARNEY'S FIRST CAR"" (1963).

My videotape version of the movie is terribly blurry. Fortunately, the quality of the sound on the videotape is perfect.  This is in contrast to a handfull of other classic movies on videotape, that are characterized by continual buzzing sounds.  Don Ameche's version of the Alexander Graham Bell movie has horrible unbearable buzzing sounds throughout.  Spencer Tracy's version of the Thomas Edison movie also has these buzzing sounds on the videotape, I recall.

CONCLUSIONS.  If you are interested in actor Anthony Quinn, then this film is a must-see.  If you are interested in stories that depict career changes, or job changes, then this movie is right on-point.  If you are a fan of the TWILIGHT ZONE series of black & white stories, and yearn to see one more great T.Z. story, then this film is a must-see.  If you are interested in ""film noir"" movies from the 1950s, then this film will satisfy your urge.  If you like boxing movies, for example, RAGING BULL or MILLION DOLLAR BABY, then this film should be on your list.",1262822400,,3954,4.820474777448071
1691795,5,B000063UQP,"An absolutely terrific film. A classic, definitely essential viewing. Perhaps one of the best sports films ever made. The cast, the cinematography, I can't stop gushing about this movie. Truly tremendous along the line of The Hustler starring Paul Newman and also Jackie Gleason.

I am a bit sordid about the criticism of the editing, as I have not yet bought the DVD. No offense to Jack Palance, but I prefer this version without ever having to see the original TV version.

I certainly don't like the sound of the editing job, and saw a different version from Netflix (and on TCM) that I am not sure if it is a re-released version or if I would be stuck with the butchered one. It's terrible when somebody sees fit to gut something that has already been produced.",1262390400,,765,4.576642335766423

Of the three, I bought this first, only to realize later that the one I had intended to get was the TV version starring the late Jack Palance.
Don't get me wrong, as this version is still very good, and Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney, and Anthony Quinn all do a terrific job, but the TV version is so much better, with a different ending and characters I could really care about.
Even though the production values of this version are so much higher than the Playhouse 90 version, which was taken from a kinescope (film camera pointed at a TV screen), this version left me a bit cold, which is such a shame, since Rod Serling's screenplay is superb.
All that said, this is still a great story, with something worthwhile to say about values, loyalty, and compassion.
However, if you can get the original version, I would recommend that instead, even though it is available in VHS only.

1691830,3,B000063UQP,"The film, Requiem for a Heavyweight, has many brilliant scenes, especially the ending, which is better than the televised version, where Mountain takes off to take a counseling job at a children's camp.  In the film version, without giving too much away, Mountain's shallows his pride, but keeps his integrity by saving his manager's life; therefore, giving away what little he had left for a manager who sold him out - a true sign of character!

Earlier in the film, after Mountain is told that he cannot fight anymore due to an eye injury, he's back in the gym training to be a wrestler. Mountain sees something familiar to him, a speed bag, walks to it and begins working out; never missing a beat of the small bag, demonstrating that being a fighter is what he knows and essentially what he is.  For boxing movie fans, the scene is part of the heart of the movie.

The story is an age old one that addresses the real under side of professional prize fighting. In That world, very few ever hold on to the brass ring. This movie is about a boxer who never quite gets there, and is on the down side of a career that never blossomed like the hopes and ambition or con that convinced him to quit school at an early age, to persue the Heavy weight championship of the world. He will discover that the one he counted on the most. Is the one who sales him out later to save his own hide. It's not pretty it's very sad but real. It's a warning to gold and fame chaser's.

Once ranked as high as 5th in the world, he has been reduced to a sure win for those on the way up and a payday for his manager. It's all he's ever done and he's not prepared to do anything else in life. The doc tells him this is it. Another blow to the head and his eyesight may not survive that one. His manager (Gleason) and trainer (Rooney) have other ideas. Mountain is their paycheck and besides, Gleason just bet (and lost) that Mountain wouldn't last 4 rounds against Clay. He needs to keep the franchise going because he isn't prepared for anything else, either. Mountain tries the unemployment office where the case worker (Harris) takes a personal, as well as professional, interest in helping this 'mountain' of a man who is lost outside the ring. The scene when he takes her to the bar where he always hangs out and tries to treat her like a 'lady' is a classic. Gleason, meanwhile, is being pursued by the mob to make good on his bet. Rivera is caught in the middle of this tragedy as friendship and loyalty are put to the test. This is NOT an uplifting, all ends well story.

1691836,5,B000063UQP,"""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" is a number one contender for the best movie concerning the ""sweet science"" that I have ever seen, along with Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"". Trademark Rod Serling, this powerful little film (originally made for TV) is a remorseless and scathing indictment of a society that worships force while it flourishes and edges toward the top, then is quick to jeer when it falls to the inexorable canvas of nature.

Anthony Quinn gives a gut wrenching performance as the quirky, sensitive and slightly punch-drunk Mountain Rivera, an aging prizefighter who falls at the hands of a young Muhammad Ali (still Cassius Clay at the time this film was made) at the beginning of the film and suffers a detached retina.  From the opening scene to the last, ""Requiem"" is determined to give the viewer a bitter taste of what it meant to be a boxer when mafia thugs controlled the sport and fighters were chewed up and spat out with all the grace and empathy of an ugly car accident.  Here Quinn transcends even his portrayal as Zampano the Australian strongman in Fellini's ""La Strada"".

The forces that control Rivera's destiny are pitiless (his manager Maish, played by Jackie Gleason, is a self-divided man occasionally showing signs of real tenderness toward Rivera but ultimately interested in saving his own neck) and only one other man in this whole tragic story seems to understand his plight--a young Mickey Rooney, turning in an Oscar worthy performance as his trainer Army, a former fighter turned cut-man who despises Maish for his cruel manipulation of Mountain's almost childlike loyalty to him for his own purposes.  Unfortunately, Army doesn't have much say in what happens and only has the guts to stand up to Maish in spurts, his resignation getting the better of him as he carts the old pug from employment agency to employment agency, trying to make him understand that the world is no longer his oyster and hasn't been for quite awhile.

Rivera's abrupt and somewhat unrealistic relationship with social worker Grace Miller played by Julie Harris (""The Haunting""), is possibly the only real spark of hope in Rivera's doomed life.  I don't see where Mountain couldn't have become a camp counselor or something to that effect: he does not seem so incapacitated or punch-drunk that this would be an impossibility.  Maish, with the mob breathing down his neck for the money he lost betting against his own fighter, makes sure that this doesn't happen, getting him drunk on the night of his appointment with yet another famous guest star of boxing lore, the huge Jack Dempsey.

Each scene of this film is an excruciating exercise in degradation, but somehow we feel compelled to watch.  You almost hate Serling for getting us to identify so strongly with this tough but very innocent shell of a man, and then throwing him into a pressure cooker he is neither smart enough nor mature enough to even glimpse a way out of.  That is real talent.

The ending is perhaps the strongest part of the film and is achingly honest.  When faced with the decision to pursue his own dubious prospects in life or save his manager's skin--by extension sacrificing every value he has lived by his entire ugly, violent life--the decision is inevitable.  An unforgettable, heart rending artistic accomplishment and more evidence that Serling could have been much more than the creator of that groundbreaking television series ""The Twilight Zone"".",1158537600,,3447,4.9411764705882355

1691848,5,B000063UQP,"Requiem For A Heaveyweight, the feature-length movie was released in 1962. It was initially written for television three years earlier by none other than Rod Serling. It aired on Playhouse 90 in the Fall of 1960. That production starred Keenyn Wynn in the role of Mesch, the desperate and mercinary fight manager. His dad, legendary comic, Ed Wynn played Armie, Mountain Rivera's sympathetic handler. Jack Palance was cast in the lead role of the over-the-hill pugilist, Mountain Rivera. It was shot live and played to a national auidence, a daring event for actors in the primitive new media.

The casting of the movie release is considerablly more inspired. Jackie Gleason stars as Mesch, a man desperatly attempting to stay one step ahead of the bookies and willing to sell the soul of his washed-up fighter to save his own skin. Mickey Rooney turns in an oscar worthy supporting role as Armie, Mountain's handler, confidant and ""brother's keeper"". And in the lead role we have one of Hollywood's finest dramatic actors, the inimitable, Anthony Quinn. Julie Harris plays a supporting role, as the Social Worker trying to save Mountain from becomming the side show attraction, Mesch has in store for him.

Requiem is a fascinating look at the seemley underbelly of the world of prize fighting. Like the Bogart movie ""The Harder They Fall"" Requiem loosely resembles the story of former Heavey Weight Champion, Primo Carnarra. Canarra, a giant of a man from Italy who faced a seires of bum-of-the-month has-beens to climb to the heavey weight crown. Many of these bouts were perported to be fixed. Carnara it was said had a glass jaw. Fighters then were viewed largely as commodities, expendable and easily replaced. Both movies speak directly to the heart of the grim reality of the ""sweet science"", during one of boxing's darkest periods. The film still packs an enormous punch, (pardon the pun) and holds up remarkably well over the years. See it for the great story-telling by Serling, the brilliant acting by Gleason, Quinn, Rooney and Julie Harris. And finally catch it for the marvelous cameo by a very young and irrasable Cascius Clay.",1150675200,,2143,4.983240223463687
1691849,3,B000063UQP,"I love this movie. Although I prefer the orginal TV version because the ending is more upbeat, this is still a powerful film that really does not get its due. Even on DVD. The picture is suberb, having been remastered. BUT this edited version of the film leaves out too much. With a run-time of only 86 mintues, you'd think the dim bulbs behind the DVD would want to ""pad"" the release with everything they could find. And the scenes they left out are anything but padding. Gleason's speech at the end completes his character. We see that he has been ripped apart by the last 17 years and what he was forced to do to Mountain to save his life. The scene is only 1 minute long. Would it really have been so difficult to include this?

In closing, this is a great, great movie. Rod Serling was the best tv writer of his time -- one of the great writers of all time -- and Requiem is one of his best. I recommend BOTH versions. If the DVD was a complete version of the film with some extras about the film, then it would get my highest recommendation! I was fortunate enough to get this second hand for only $4.99 and still feel let down by what is not included in the release.

The movie is worth watching. Make no mistake. If you've never seen it before, it will rip your guts out. But for long-time fans of the film, this DVD release just doesn't measure up. Great picture and sound. Great viewing experience. Incomplete movie. Here's hoping a future relase will correct the mistakes made on this one.

Precisely in this demolisher drama Anthony Quinn makes one of his supreme artworks, playing the role of boxer in free fall. The progressive process of decadence and moral wreck is shown with impeccable precision and convincing dramatizing mood.

To my mind Ralph Nelson shaped this minor jewel in the Pantheon of the immortality. It will never be reminded among the Greatest Films in any age ever filmed but its inner honesty overpasses by far, many superior films.",1111708800,,637,4.781818181818182

The film is marked by strong performances from some of the best actors available at that time. It is not a classic boxing movie in the traditional sense but instead it is a film which focuses on the personal and social damage associated with a sordid business.
Anthony Quinn as a punchy heavyweight at the end of a long career and Jackie Gleason as his greedy, conniving manager are superb. Mickey Rooney is the boxer's trainer and Julie Harris is the employment counselor who tries to help Quinn make the transition to a life after boxing. There are cameo appearances by Cassius Clay and Jack Dempsey.

This film is one of the great forgotten masterpieces. Rarely do you see such depth of emotion as displayed by the three leading characters: Anthony Quinn, Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason. This is undoubtedly Quinn's greatest and most poignant performance, he delivers a knock out interpretation of the brain-damaged Mountain Rivera. Make-up and a false nose disguises Quinn's good looks and he resembles a drunken Victor MacLagen here. Mickey Rooney, always seriously underrated, is magnificent as Mountain's assistant. And Jackie Gleason is perfection as the greasy, sleazy manager. The scene of him on the stairwell with Julie Harris is one of the great moments in cinema history. What a movie!
I'm at a loss to explain why this brilliant film is not universally recognized as one of the great movies ever made. The acting is superb, the screenplay gripping and the ending will mesmerize you. A thinking man's flick, to be sure. This is definitely a keeper.",1079827200,,1182,5.066666666666666
1691853,1,B000063UQP,"This is a remarkable film. Remarkable because it is the death of a man's life style. It teaches that many people's lives are cut short without being killed. A person's life is more than their physical life. It is their way of life that attributes to their life. Cut a man's reason for living and you might as well kill him physically. Ironically, the film was filmed on location in the Washington Market Area of lower manhattan. Any area that was in it's own dying days which can be seen from the decay of the neighbor hood. And area that would be totally destroyed to make way for the World Trade Center some 5 years later, another tragitic story in it's own right. My father actually watched some of the filming of this fim on Murray Street. The film crew actually brought the old Susquehanna Hotel back to life for most of this film. The dreary sceens are real, filmed in the dead Susquehanna Hotel. Sadly, the most depressing thing about this film is the fact that the Jerks who put the movie on DVD used an edited version. Why?

Quinn trying to get a moving van job...etc.  There's no warning on the DVD cover that it does NOT contain the movie Requiem For A Heavyweight but rather selected scenes from the real movie.  On the back of the DVD case however there are two pictures from scenes in the movie...they are among the scenes that are NOT included on the DVD.  That strikes me as deceptive.

In the case of the moving and powerful ""Requiem"" (and I agree with the customer who feels that the Jackie Gleason/Julie Harris staircase scene belongs at the top of the all-time list of great movie scenes), the film was obviously released in several different versions.
The confusion begins,in fact, immediately after the staircase scene. There are AT LEAST THREE SCENES from the latter part of the film that are NOT INCLUDED on the DVD:
1.) Gleason's encounter with the vile Ma Greeny in the hallway when he tells her he'd ""like to run into her when you're not grafted to that torpedo..."" (referring to her big thug/bodyguard).
2.) A lengthy (and painful) scene where Quinn is training to be a wrestler, and the moronic Pirelli (Stan Adams, the only actor to reprise his role from the 1956 TV original version) signals Quinn's wrestling partner to intentionally gouge his bad eye, whereupon Quinn beats the crap out of the guy.....
3.) Gleason's final speech on the rotten world of Prize Fighting which he delivers to the young wanna-be.....
If Serling ultimately wanted these scenes cut, WHY IN THE WORLD were they ot included as EXTRAS??? I have old video copies of late-night, local TV airings of this film that are FAR MORE COMPLETE than this state-of-the-art DVD release.

1691856,5,B000063UQP,"If the use of the word Requiem in the title doesnt give the game away, let me assure you that this superb film is as far removed from the wisecracking of Errol Flynns Gentleman Jim, the ludicrous spectacle of Elvis wearing boxing gloves in Kid Galahad, and the pathetic, testosterone driven fantasies of Rocky, as its possible to get while making a film about the same subject matter the fight game. Filmed in stark black and white in 1962, Requiem for a Heavyweight doesnt waste a single second of its barely 90 minute running time in getting started, and features one of the most electrifying opening sequences I think Ive ever seen.
First of all we see the viewpoint from a camera backing up behind a bar, watching the patrons, all men, as they stare intently at a TV screen up on the wall behind the camera. Theyre watching a boxing match, and we know this because of the hyperbolic commentary coming from the TV; the old pro won't quit even though his blood is spattered all over Clay! The Old Pro is a boxer named Mountain Rivera, and hes being beaten to a pulp in front of a baying crowd by a young kid named Cassius Clay, the boxer the world now knows as Mohamed Ali!
The camera cuts to the boxing ring, and what we see is blurred and distorted. Clay moves into view, firing off punches, moving out of reach, then coming in for the kill; suddenly were looking up at the lights, the referee is standing over us, counting to 10, then mercifully, its over. Mountains manager and trainer rush into view, help him up, our view of the world shifts and blurs as the trainer tends to cuts and abrasions; helped out of the ring on unsteady legs, Mountain is led through a jeering crowd, and still we are seeing the world as he sees it. They go through a door, heading for the changing rooms and showers, a distorted face suddenly looms into view, and just a quickly shrinks away, shocked and horrified; the camera spins around, and finally we get our first look at the boxer. Dazed and confused, supported by his manager and trainer, Mountain is a battered mess, his swollen face runs with blood from cuts around the eyes and cheeks, he looks uncomprehendingly at his own reflection in the mirror of a cigarette machine if this opening doesnt draw you in, nothing will!
Once in the changing room we learn that Mountain is all washed up, after 17 years in the ring, one more well placed punch to the head could blind him, permanently. What is he to do? But the boxer isn't the only one with problems, Maish, his manager for all of those 17 years, owes the mob, BIG time, partly as a result of Mountains fight against Clay. But its Mountains plight that takes center stage; what is he to do now that he cant fight? All he knows is life in the ring.
Almost in desperation he visits an employment counselor, and what at the outset appears to be a disaster in the making, becomes a turning point in Mountains life. The counselor is a young woman, somewhat sheltered in her upbringing; Mountain, and his world, is completely outside of her experience. But after some initial trepidation, she looks beyond the battered face, the cauliflower ears, the slurred speech and the sometimes shambling walk, to see Mountains heart. Strong and proud after those 17 hard years in the ring, hed never thrown a fight and was once rated the no. 5 heavyweight in the world. She tries a long shot, and against all the odds is able to offer Mountain a chance at a life outside the ring. But Maish is in a hole, and what he needs is a fighter will he let Mountain go?
This is a superb production, written by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame, the script is relentless in its exposure of, not only, the fight game, but the dark underbelly of human nature itself. And as good as Serlings script is, what really makes this film work are the four central characters, and how they are brought to life on the screen. First and foremost, Anthony Quinn gives a magnificent, heartbreakingly honest performance as Mountain Rivera, and Jackie Gleason is slime personified as his manager Maish. Mickey Rooney, who Ive long considered a lightweight in the acting stakes, pours his heart into the role of, not only Mountains trainer, but his only true friend, and Julie Harris is luminous as the Employment Counselor who offers him that all important second chance.
Much has been said in the other reviews of this film about previous and alternative versions of the story, and how they alter the perception of Gleasons character, Maish, in particular. This is the only version Ive seen, although I would love to see the original, and I bought this on the strength of the Amazon reviews alone, something I very rarely do. A forgotten masterpiece, Requiem for a Heavyweight won't be to everybodys liking, especially those who think Rocky paints a realistic picture of the fight game! This is strong meat, grim and repellent, but its also a fascinating and magnificent tale of honor, sacrifice, and friendship HIGHLY recommended!",1053129600,,4987,4.598204264870931
1691884,5,B000063UQP,"""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" is as much a film about boxing as ""Taxi Driver"" is about cab driving. Gloves are the departure point for the pummeling Anthony Quinn takes as he is forced into civilian life after close to twenty years of taking brutal jabs to the head. Galumphing across back alleys and the corridor of a posh hotel, he insists that he could've been a contender once, and would triumph if his mob consorting manager (Jackie Gleason) would allow him one more fight. Mickey Rooney, Quinn's trainer, on being told that Quinn might go blind should he take any more blows to the head, puts his foot down, forcing Gleason into a corner with the mob, with his only way out in the spectacle of Quinn wrestling for an oily impresario in the circus-like company of dwarves and costumed behemoths.
Rod Serling's screenplay (teleplay?) thankfully skirts sentimentality. The scenes of Quinn's bumbling courtship of social worker Harris ring with an authenticity that is moving; here we have a Kaspar Hauser figure whose adult life has been circumscribed by the ropes of a prizefighting ring, suddenly cast out of his Garden and forced to wander the land. Not only are his social skills not up to par, but his speech has been mangled by having his teeth kicked in so many times. Into his life wanders someone who wants to make a difference, who sees the humanity, who knows that without a compass he may wind up as just another gutter bum. Just watch the scene when Harris comes into the blue collar bar where Quinn is drinking - watch as they share a beer, like two teenagers on a first date, giddy and starry eyed, alone against the universe. That is the sweetest moment in a film whose finale, while humiliating, shows the depths of Quinn's altruism.",1043193600,,1751,4.688311688311688
1691885,5,B000063UQP,"'Requiem for a Heavyweight' is not only one of the great forgotten boxing pictures, it's also one of those movies that has almost vanished.  Thankfully this DVD release will help keep this great film alive.
Anthony Quinn superbly plays Mountain Rivera, a 37 year old fighter who risks losing his eyesight if he continues to fight.  His manager (Jackie Gleason), his trainer (Mickey Rooney), and a new-found lady friend (Julie Harris) all have different ideas about Mountain's future.  Just what CAN a fighter do after 17 years in the ring?
While most of the drama takes place outside the ring, Rod Serling's script delivers tension, conflict and suspense in way you wouldn't expect from a 1962 film.  You can almost see the characters thinking about where they are, where they're going, and how Mountain Rivera can and does affect their lives.
The brilliance of the film's cast is electrifying.  Every actor is in absolutely tip-top form.  These performances are a real pleasure to watch.  This film contains no weak links.
Other reviewers have commented on the several different versions of the film.  The film originally aired on television on a show called ""Playhouse 90.""

1691886,5,B000063UQP,"I submitted a review of this movie earlier today--""There Were Giants in Those Days.""
This is meant as possible addendum to my review, if the review's okay. One of the customer reviews concerns the missing ending of the movie. I've found Rod Serling's reading version of the script, published by Bantam in 1962. The ending of the reading version does indeed have a scene with Maish telling this would be fighter how tough a ""game"" it is, and how ""the good's great--the bad stinks."" He tells the young man they will try him out, and Army resignedly agrees. This version ends with Maish hearing the catcalls and laughter at Mountain in the wrestling ring, as the manager puts his head in his hands and weeps.
 This final scene I remember was either added to or edited out of its various television runs because of commercial time and to fit a two hour time slot. Over the years, the film has been edited in different ways, with various scenes missing or kept intact, or added. And yes it is very frustrating. I saw the movie first on TV, not at the theatre.
The part of the scene I mention that has been excised, where Army tells Maish he will rot in hell, I've seen in every version, save this one on DVD.
I hope I've been of some help.",1024704000,,1234,4.412280701754386
1691887,3,B000063UQP,"As someone else mentioned this DVD is missing at least a few scenes than the version that is sometimes played on TV.
I purchased this DVD after viewing a portion of the movie on TV - What I saw on TV that made the biggest impression on me, was a scene towards the very end of the movie.  Jackie Gleason confronted by the up and coming boxer and his handler gives one of the most powerful speeches of the movie, and some of the most memorable acting I've ever seen.  He chides these two for believing that they could be a champion for believing that they'll turn out any different than the Mountain, and rejects their offer to be their manager.
Not only was the speech powerful, the acting superb but also the scene gives insight into the future of Gleason's character.  Maish, has learned his lesson, he isn't going to be manager another boxer for 17 year while chasing the ghost of a championship.  He is still a bum who betted against his own fighter, but the story goes to great lengths to make Gleason more than just a one-dimensional rotten manager, and this final scene brings that point home.
I don't why these scenes were excluded. Maybe this is the original release version - but then why weren't they included as extras on the DVD?  I don't know.  I hope that at some point, this movie, with the missing scenes is released on DVD.  If it is I will happily buy that version - While this DVD is crisp and clean, while the story is still great and the acting perfect - to know that these other scenes are missing, particularly the one I mentioned, well in this case this DVD isn't enough
- Complete its a 5 stars - incomplete its still great - but I can't help feeling I'm missing an important part of the movie without it including these scenes - so I am giving it 3 stars - to draw attention that something is missing from this movie - and not as a reflection of the movie that is on the DVD which is still great  -",1023408000,,1924,4.2809917355371905
1691888,4,B000063UQP,"This is a golden oldie if there ever was one.  Adapted from Rod Serling's earlier ""Playhouse 90"" TV drama, it improved greatly on the original by taking full advantage of the film medium, including moody film-noir lighting, an excellent music score, and superb direction.  Anthony Quinn is excellent, getting all the pathos out of the role without overdoing it.  Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason, neither of whom is renowned for subtlety and restraint, hit just the right note in their performances, as does Julie Harris.  The ending of this film couldn't be more different than the ""Playhouse 90"" ending.  One of the more bizarre elements of this film, which was not in the original TV play, is the character of Ma Greeney, a really frightening person and the only example I am aware of in film of a lesbian gangster (and in 1962, yet).  I can still remember how startled I was to see this character when I first watched this film on TV back in the late 1960s.
The new DVD of ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" offers both a full-screen and wide-screen presentation.  The quality of the transfer is really outstanding.  The liner notes indicate that it is mastered in high definition.  While I don't have the hardware to watch it in high-def., I can say that on an ordinary monitor it looks outstanding.  Perhaps the sharpest DVD picture I've ever seen.  The sound is clear, and the subtitles are very helpful in picking out dialog that may be indistinct, or not easily understood because of Anthony Quinn's manner of delivering the lines while in character.
However...  It seems to me that at least one whole scene and a part of another scene is missing.  I distinctly remember Maish (Jackie Gleason) telling Ma Greeney what he would do to her if she weren't a lady.  In response, she laughs and says ""that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.""  This is part of the early scene where Maish is attacked in an abandoned boxing ring by Ma's thugs.  There is another whole scene I can recall in which Mountain (Anthony Quinn) is practicing holds with a wrestler.  He asks that the wrestler stay away from his injured eye, and when he purposely goes for the eye, Mountain punches his lights out.  The cuts I recall seeing on TV years ago always included these scenes, and I've never seen this shortened cut of the film before.  It's still a great film, but I really miss these two scenes.  I would have given it five stars had it not been a shortened cut.",1021939200,,2453,4.621247113163972
1691889,5,B000063UQP,"This 1962 adaptation of an Emmy-winning Playhouse 90 production and adapted by Rod Serling from his original 1956 television drama, is a heavy hitter. It's about a fighter, brilliantly played by Anthony Quinn who, after a 17-year career in the ring, has to resign because of a medical condition. He's never done anything else but fight and now tries to find a job. A sympathetic employment counselor, played by Julie Harris, tries to get him a job in a summer camp.  His manager, played by Jackie Gleason, however, owes money to the mob and wants him to work in staged wrestling matches, much to the displeasure of his trainer, Mickey Rooney.  The screenplay is totally real and immediately drew me into the story; the outcome is inevitable.
Each one of the cast members does an outstanding job, especially Anthony Quinn. His face is battered, his voice thick and he's slow and punchy.  I could almost see his thinking process, with just an extra second or two for anything to register.  I identified with this man who never did make champion and who was now just 37 years old and at the end of his career.  Jackie Gleason was the perfect unscrupulous manager and I hated him throughout, but also saw his humanity and real fear as the mob came after him.  Mickey Rooney as the good-hearted trainer was wonderful too and he and Gleason had some great scenes together. Gleason is large and Rooney is small; this added yet another element to the film. Julie Harris keeps her dignity throughout and there is a scene in a bar between her and Anthony Quinn that I will always remember.  To top off this star-studded cast, there is a scene with the real Mohamed Ali, then Cassius Clay, in the opening segment of the film.  And, later, Jack Dempsey makes a short appearance.
There's an authenticity to it all and real emotion and done so well that for a little while I lived in the world of the fight game.  It's not pleasant, nor was it meant to be.  But this is a fine filmmaking even though this film won no awards or nominations.  Highly recommended.  See it if you can.",1012608000,,2066,4.569105691056911
1691890,4,B000063UQP,"The best boxing movies are critical of the sport,especially of the managers,promoters and the criminal element that infest the game. I would cite the splendid The Harder They Fall and The Set-Up Not for these honest movies the  saccharine confections as The Leather Saint/Kid Galahad etc
Requiem for a Heavyweight is cursed with a bombastic title but is a memorable picture in which Anthony Quinn plays a washed up Boxer forced to seek a new line of work when eye problems bring about an enforced retirement His manager,for mercenary reasons,wishes him to take up the demeaning charade that is pro wrestling as he needs a quick buck to pay off his debts to the mob,while Quinn's friends(Micky Rooney as his cut man,and Julie Harris as an earnest employment counsellor) seek to steer him along more honest paths
The towering centrepiece to this movie is a performance of raw and understated power from Quinn while Gleason as his manager is also superbThe device of using real boxers or ex-boxers in support roles runs afoul of their lack of acting ability
As with most Rod Serling works there are passages where dialogue is replaced by sermonising,especially in the dialogue given to Harris but there is a raw power here that makes the picture compulsive if painful viewing",1008115200,,1272,4.916279069767442
1691891,4,B000063UQP,"Some movies simply require black and white; color would certainly have spoiled the flavor of this grim story.  Anthony Quinn plays a boxer at the dead end of a punishing career. With no skills or experience outside the  ring, and a manager who would sell his soul to pay off a vicious gambler,  he has nowhere to go until one person sees something more in him and offers  a bit of hope. There are people who prefer the Jack Palance version (which  was done for TV prior to this full-length film), but the very different  ending of this version is more credible.",914371200,,561,4.450980392156863
