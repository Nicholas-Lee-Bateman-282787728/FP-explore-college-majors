2062147,5,B00024E6AE,"Another great job! It is so refreshing to see intelligent argumentation for design. It is amazing to me that in this scientific age we are still speaking of evolution. It is obvious that everything around us was artfully designed with a purpose in mind. Just consider the design that one can see in their own back yard in a tree! From a tiny seed to a majestic Cedar;capillary action;photosynthesis;a food source and habitation for life. We speak of ""the web of life"" appreciating how everything is woven together in a delicate and intricate weave; not what you would expect from chance or a big bang! But rather the masterful work of a great mind-The True Artist",1289433600,5,663,4.724137931034483
2062148,5,B00024E6AE,"True science follows the evidence without preconception always searching for the truth.  After viewing this DVD, one would wonder how anyone could arrive at any conclusion other than that the things around us have been created by an intelligence.  Of course it is next to impossible to divorce our personal and cultural biases from any investigative endeavor.  The producers of this DVD have assiduously striven to avoid use of the ""G"" word.  Fair enough.  Religion has done more to dishonor and misrepresent God than any other institution in the history of humankind, so they have lost all right to honorable mention.  However, if we were to enter an investigation into the nature of life without any preconceptions either for or against a God, or conversely, for or against random chance, where would the evidence leads us? That is the question that this DVD very effectively answers.",1274400000,5,886,5.034246575342466
2062149,5,B00024E6AE,"This is a review of both ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life,"" and ""Where Does the Evidence Lead?""

""Show me the money"" is a famous line from Tom Cruise in Jerry McGuire.  Also, ""Can you handle the truth?""  If you think you can, here's a program for you.  It tells it like it is, shows you the money, in plain simple English, scientific observational facts, and let's the audience, you, take these truth and decide for yourself whether you can handle it.  Let the fireworks begin.  DNA codes as the blue print of building blocks, like a blue print coding for a house.  This is the ultimate premise of this show.  No science can explain the existence, energy or force of DNA in creating life.  As simple as it sounds, as complicated it is, even coding for a flagellum of a bacteria, still requires someone to lay down the construction.  Imagine coding for humans.  This is the stigma of this video.  So here's the new line Mr. Cruise, ""Where Does the Evidence Lead?,"" and ""The Mystery of Life?"" surely no science can explain it, yet, and I doubt it ever will.  You decide, you are your own believer in the truth.

My only complaint is they repeatedly state the shortcomings of Darwin's theory.  But you are still correct; the DNA blue print of life's synthesis is still an unresolved mystery.  Don't ruin your valid point with other arguments against evolution.

As far as the release, ""Where Does the Evidence Lead"" is an updated version of ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life.""  Personally, I liked the former cuz it's newer/revised, but it appears based on the number of reviews, the latter being around longer has sold more copies.",1271548800,8,1624,4.63859649122807
2062150,5,B00024E6AE,"This DVD has been invaluable in helping my family understand some of the holes in the macro-evolutionary dogma assumed by most of the media and educational institutions.  It should be pointed out that the Bible and Genesis do not enter into the discussion -- so this is not a ""Christian"" film touting the Biblical view of a 7-day creation.  The scientists just point to evidence -- scientific facts -- that cannot be satisfactorily explained away by Darwin's theory of origins.  And as a programmer/analyst who loves minute details, seeing the overview of the complexity of cells and DNA was absolutely fascinating.  I can't help but compare what I saw to an elaborate ""biological"" computer program.",1260316800,12,699,5.052173913043478
2062151,4,B00024E6AE,"I purchased this movie with The Mysteries of Life because I thought it was a follow up to the other movie.  It is actually the same movie.  The difference was that this film was sectioned out into the different areas, which was nice.  However, all of the information was exactly the same as The Mysteries of Life.  If I was going to purchase either of them again, I would purchase Where does the Evidence Lead over The Mysteries of Life because of the way they have sectioned the different areas of information.",1239148800,77,511,4.521739130434782
2062152,5,B00024E6AE,"This is a visually appealing and mentally satisfying film.  It answers questions about the design of life on Earth that are not allowed to be asked in most classroom settings.  The stars of this film are scientists who have knowledge in apecific areas, all pointing toward an Intelligent Designer.  There is nothing religious here, just scientific.  I have more than one copy.",1228348800,27,376,5.016129032258065
2062153,5,B00024E6AE,Think book is very informative and eduational. Eye-opening and helps fill in some gaps in some science,1224806400,6,102,5.0588235294117645
2062154,5,B00024E6AE,"Darwin's own words and an Evolutionary Micro Biologist's will tell it all. Presented with the intellectually honest in mind.  This may even change your mind as much as it did those featured in this DVD.  Gives someone a whole lot to think about when it comes to what you think started everyone's exsistance. I thought I'd heard the best evidence on Creation vs. Evolution until watching this DVD!

Good for Jr. High to Adult.",1200096000,51,425,4.716216216216216

2062158,5,B00024E6AE,The entire DVD is very well done technically and presents a clear scientific account of our beginnings.,1412121600,,103,5.117647058823529
2062159,5,B00024E6AE,Highly recommend this video to any thinking individual,1411084800,,54,5.875
2062160,5,B00024E6AE,"So very refreshing. At last a review of creation you can be sure anyone will understand and they make their point very well. Science is catching on to what regular folks have known since the beginning. We are now out of the 19th century. Welcome to the 21st century. Science now knows apes or monkeys are not related to man by way of natural selection etc. There is a Creator and most of us know who He is. You want hear that in the DVD, but the point is there. You make up your mind and after watching this DVD doing so is easy.",1410134400,3,529,4.096153846153846
2062161,5,B00024E6AE,Glad to see someone is exposing evolution as the myth it is. This film does an excellent job of portraying the facts in an easy to understand way.,1407974400,,146,4.25
2062162,5,B00024E6AE,"I was looking for a video that would present the evidence for Intelligent Design to balance out my sixth-grade son's public school science experience.  He was only given instruction in Evolutionary theory.  This video is divided into six short segments which make viewing easy.  While some of it is pretty technical, it does a good job of objectively presenting a case for Intelligent Design.",1405987200,,392,5.09375
2062163,4,B00024E6AE,"The product was exactly as described. If I were to criticize it, I would describe it as a tad too advanced for general consumption, but
I don't see how one could water it down in a 60 minute presentation. It definitely is presented for a college educated consumer. I was
especially impressed by the credentialed scientists, and the absence of overt religious content in their views, though I am not opposed
to those positions in any respect. The production should appeal to ""critical thinkers"" in addition to agenda-driven viewers, and in this
respect, the product delivers. Highly recommended!",1399680000,2,594,5.071428571428571
2062164,5,B00024E6AE,"Great computer graphics of what goes on inside the cell.
Good explanation of the evidences for design and the shortcomings of any evolutionary explanation.",1385769600,,155,5.5
2062165,5,B00024E6AE,"Simply mind boggling. The presentation, the graphics, and the arguments are all breath taking. And accessible by a non-scientist like me. Makes me want to say to Dawkins and all atheists- ""Grow Up"", but I'm way too polite for that.",1384646400,,231,4.8
2062166,5,B00024E6AE,"Jay has compiled the latest scientific information and presents it in an logical fashion.  I think that Darwin was a brilliant man who needed more information to finish his work.  When considered with the 6th edition of ""The Origin"",the whole picture comes into focus.
A MUST watch!",1373155200,4,282,4.9787234042553195
2062167,5,B00024E6AE,"I enjoyed this presentation because it is, refreshingly, making available knowledge of scientific discoveries which, is seems, are for some reason being supressed by 'mainstream' science. Neo-Darwinism permeates Western culture to such an extent that to fundamentally change or abandon the theory would be to overturn deeply entrenched thinking and practices but that in itself is not a good enough reason to block evidence which seems to invalidate it. So why is mainstream science so worried about this possibility when it is committed to following evidence where it leads? I have to leave the answer to a would be viewer of this DVD but it is well worth viewing even if only to appreciate that being selective with evidence is no way to conduct science and that the media's underlying neo-Darwinian assumptions could be misleading despite the apparent explanatory power of the theory.",1369699200,6,887,5.20979020979021
2062168,5,B00024E6AE,"It is amazing, very engaging and with lots of scientific information and data.  Loved it - was and am still
amazed at how complicated a single cell is and that it contains a computer with intricate and vast programs that according to Bill Gates contains more information than the largest computer known to man.",1367625600,2,310,4.7407407407407405
2062169,5,B00024E6AE,"Very informative and easy to understand.  This video provides enough evidence for even the most ardent skeptic to be stopped in the fallacious belief there is no God and we are mere accidents of chaos.  This video leaves no doubt that God is the creator, Lord and King of the heavens, the earth, and the seas and all that is therein.",1361577600,2,333,4.442622950819672
2062170,5,B00024E6AE,Material was very easy to comprehend and knowledgeable. Gives good scientific knowledge of the cellular structure of our bodies and shows the beautiful and excellent work of the creator (GOD),1358467200,2,191,5.4
2062171,5,B00024E6AE,"This video is intelligent and objective in its evaluation of the problems pertaining to Darwinian macroevolution. As for production quality, it could be shown by NBC, except that they never would!  It is well worth consideration by those who want the whole story in the evolution debate. The intelligent design folks get hit with all manner of verbal and personal abuse. While there is intelligent design stuff out there that is clearly defective, this makes a convincing case that deserves an intelligent, considered response without personal abuse.",1329868800,3,550,5.32183908045977
2062172,4,B00024E6AE,"Nice item, thanks. I would recommend this to someone who is interested in seeing a quality product that shows the argument for intelligent design.  A+",1317600000,2,150,5.0
2062173,5,B00024E6AE,"I purchased this with it being a followup to ""Exploring the Mysteries of Life"".  This is the same video, but broken up into 6 segments for teaching.  I passed it on to our pastor, who is using it to teach our teenage class at church.  He is highly enthusiastic about it, and basically considers a phenomenal source.  This video will literally give a different outlook on the evolution theory.  The great part about it is that these are all scientists and the whole thing is taken from a totally non-religious perspective.  Some who claim they are open-minded will no doubt slam these findings, but a true, open-minded person will have to at least there is a lot of merit to what is presented.",1305331200,5,692,4.585365853658536
2062174,4,B00024E6AE,A very interesting movie with fair sense of interpreting evidence. Whoever made this series does not draw any religious conclusion. Instead they just provides the evidence and let the audience to make conclusions. No matter if you are religious or not I definitely suggest watching this short movie (It is only 1 hr long) for it could be educational in terms of basic cell biology.,1294531200,5,381,4.876923076923077
8022013,5,B00024E6AE,"For most of my 80 years, I have read tons of scientific information, both pro and con, and have come to the conclusion that evolution is a big hoax, especially when so many believe the fossil record supports it when it does not. In fact, because it does not, anxious evolutionist have pulled all kinds of underhanded claims which have bamboozled the true believers but leave many of us with grave doubts.",1525305600,,404,4.625

8022019,5,B00024E6AE,I have had a pre-view of this DVD and just say nothing but Good about it.  For all you people on the edge between Creationism versus Darwinism this should set you on the right path.  Natural selection has been taught for years without any seemingly no opposition until several honest people took a fresh look at the flaws in Darwins theory.,1430870400,,340,4.557377049180328
