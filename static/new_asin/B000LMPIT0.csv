8162157,4,B000LMPIT0,"The DVD was well done, but missed the mark by a considerable margin.  The problem is that were no actual hunting incidents.  To many of the shots were not realistic to a hunting scenario.  I purchased this for my son who is a relative novice to the shotgun shooting sports.  I watched the DVD myself because I am an experienced shot gunner and have hunted many different species of game birds for more than five decades.  Probably for the totally inexperienced shooter this DVD would be very helpful.",1483660800,,500,4.636363636363637
8162158,5,B000LMPIT0,this was shot in the early mid 1980's on film then VHS and now DVD.  The information on techniques is priceless and worth the money.  I should caution you he uses the lead method to shooting.,1371168000,,191,4.277777777777778
