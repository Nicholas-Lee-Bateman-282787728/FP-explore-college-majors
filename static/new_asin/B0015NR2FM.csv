8259301,5,B0015NR2FM,"Wow! Great insight into women's struggle to vote. So sad to see how recently this simple right was kept from so many. Men must realize that equal treatment of women is not a luxury for them, it is their right. Equal pay, equal respect. So much more to be done. How can a man respect himself if does not respect basic rights of women? GOP wake up!",1455494400,2,346,4.17910447761194

8259303,1,B0015NR2FM,"In reading this book, I was reminded of how easily it is to revise history.

The book portrays suffragettes as heroines who pursued a just and noble cause. The book cherry picks various aspects of the women's suffragette movement as a struggle for ""equality"" and ""rights.""

The book completely overlooks the fact that ""suffragettes"" were a violent, racist and misandrist group who sought supremacy based on their gender, without any accountability or responsibilities. The ""suffragettes"" sought, with violence, to have the right to vote with no corresponding duty to serve in the armed services, accept social responsibilities for the support of their families, or, assume any of the legal responsibilities to society imposed on men.
