1803546,5,B00007AJE7,"This film is in a class of it's own. A classic 1960's black and white movie from the UK that is better, much better than you might think. Set in a typical parish in rural England, Peter Sellers plays a kind, honest and loyal vicar that battles church, the locals and goverment to do what is right for a family of gypsies.
It's the kind of film that makes you feel good, and that is what counts.",1043193600,14,394,4.12987012987013
1803547,5,B00007AJE7,"This film is doubly satisfying - fine, understated British comedy plus a serious treatment of applying Christianity practically.

The Sellers role, a priest completely devoted to Jesus' social justice gospel, closely parallels Jesus' own life - humble beginnings, complete faith in service, sudden notoriety, betrayal and ascension into the heavens. He is outwardly a failure but inwardly a success.

The supporting characters carry their roles with disciplined understatement, among them Eric Sykes and Ida Handel.

The story line and directing are strong and effective.",1268352000,3,571,5.773809523809524
1803548,4,B00007AJE7,"At the open of the Boulting brothers' production of HEAVENS ABOVE (1963)!, Peter Sellers is a prison chaplin. As one of two Anglican ministers named John Smallwood, he's errantly appointed reverend to the stodgy village of Orbiston Parva. (The ""other"" Smallwood appears later. He's played by Ian Carmichael.)

Rev. John's socialistic beliefs are immediately at odds with the town's leading citizen, wealthy matron Lady Despard (Isabel Jeans), whose family fortune is derived from ""Tranquilax,"" a 3-in-1 curative product. The vicar's earnest concern for her immortal soul and a biblical reminder about rich folks and ""the eye of a needle"" convince Lady D. to disperse her millions to the needy. She and Smallwood set up a non-denominational free food distribution center that in short order puts the town's butchers, grocers and dairymen out of work.

The minister's superiors are alerted to unrest in Orbiston Parva and visit Smallwood who, in an act of charity has taken in the Smiths, an enormous family of vagabonds. (Cast note: the oldest Smith boy, Jack is Steve Marriott, late of David Merrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OLIVER/dp/B000025BD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OLIVER!</a>&nbsp;and soon a member of rock group the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Small-Faces/dp/B000083GPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Small Faces</a>). Archdeacon Aspinall (Ian Parker) is shocked at the vicarage's rundown condition and concerned about commercial griping over Smallwood's food bank. He summons Rev. John for a psychiatric examination. The shrink mistakenly speaks with the ""other"" Smallwood, who's outraged that his plumb post was usurped by our hero. The psychiatrist diagnoses him as a violent paranoid schizophrenic, while Rev. John waits quietly for his appointment.

From this point our man of the cloth's good fortune rapidly turns quite sour. There's unruly crowds, strife, and the wistful realization of failure. The story ends most ludicrously, on a small arctic island being used by the fledglng British space program. An ill-considered, tacked-on attempt at humor makes for a desperately weak finale. Those last 10 minutes spoil what was a most engaging movie, but it's still well-worth seeing.

1803550,3,B00007AJE7,"This is not one of Seller's finest.  He turns in a capable and charming performance but cannot save the script from itself.  Added to this is the number of inside jokes that are only accessible to the British and you have a film that is difficult for American audiences.

The plot isn't actually bad.  It raises some good questions and seems to build towards what may be a wonderful ending, but then becomes mired in a silly and pointless finish that doesn't relate to the main questions it raises.  As a typical American who has a soft spot for British film and for Sellers I'm sorry to say I found it to be less than rewarding.

Most aspects of the film are capable including direction, photography, and acting.  I found the film interesting as a cultural artifact, revealing insights into British life during that time, but this is not enough to make it a film to own unless one must have every Sellers' film ever made.",1231891200,,922,4.518072289156627

1803552,5,B00007AJE7,"""Be careful what you wish for; you may get it."" That seems to be the case with this 1963 gem. Rev. John Smallwood (Peter Sellers) is an Anglican priest who is the epitome of the unwavering, though nave, Christian. Never afraid of what people or mobs may think, he revolutionizes life in the fictional town of Orbiston Parva. A major convert is Lady Despard, wife of a late drug magnate. Listening to Smallwood and reading her Bible, she decides to sell all that she has (all the stock that she owns in the company) and gives it to the poor through food distribution. Unfortunately, some recipients of the food gifts aren't the needy poor. Some of the wealthy in town send the chauffeur to the food pantry for the week's groceries. The head of the Smith clan, to which Smallwood has given the rectory to as living space, reserves some of the food not to give to the most poor, but to sell on the black market. Shop keepers like the butcher and grocer lose customers and are bankrupted by Lady Despard's generosity. Her kindness has national consequences. Because the sale of her majority ownership of stock ruins confidence in the firm, the family drug company is bankrupt, and its 200 employees lose their jobs. The film raises the issue of balancing Christian charity with Christian justice.",1206144000,2,1292,4.6960352422907485
1803553,4,B00007AJE7,"What a brilliant script and movie.

Sellers inhabits his role perfectly, the supporting players are all spot on, and the endless barbs and accompanying subtle visual gags are often laugh out loud funny.

And boy oh boy, no mercy is shown to organized religion and big business (if there is any real difference). Razor sharp satire hits home again and again, as in, ""Try Tranquilax! It stimulates! It sedates! It's a laxative!"" And when the priest turns down a donation because the givers aren't true Christians...well, this is fiction, after all.

At moments Heavens Above feels like the logical precursor to Monty Python, in many ways. A higher compliment would be hard to find.

Beautifully shot with lots of natural light as well.
This film has aged perfectly; its only fault is a rather weak ending.

I'm glad there are so many truly intelligent old movies like this out there; they sure ain't making many these daze!

 Both town and church are in for a surprise,however, for their new Vicar actually takes the Gospels SERIOUSLY! How this modern day parable (with screenplay by author journalist malcom muggeridge, atheist turned Christian believer late in his life) plays out is at once

a funny and scathing critique of both Church and State. People of any or no religious persuasion will enjoy watching Sellers at his deadpan best. A must see film.",1143244800,11,621,5.068627450980392
1803555,4,B00007AJE7,"Sellers is appropriately low-key and gentle in his role of a latter-day (sixties Britain)cleric whose attempts to emulate the work of Christ are either thwarted by the rich (the aristocrats and church hierarchy)or misunderstood by it's intended beneficiaries (i.e. the welfare family who he's given shelter who are looting the church).

1803556,5,B00007AJE7,"""Heavens Above"" immediately preceded ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Pink Panther"" with Sellers at the top of his form. He blends into the role of Rev. Smallwood with such completeness that he seemingly went through catechism and seminary - perhaps even journeyed back in time to the Sermon on the Mount.
Smallwood is mistakenly placed as the priest of small town, which is profoundly in need of a priest. Unfortunately, what the town needs and what they want are entirely opposite. Without agenda and in full conviction of the Christian gospel, Smallwood takes every utterance of Jesus as the standard by which society should operate. Smallwood's attempt in the twentieth-century works about as well as his first-century counterpart's.
A truly thoughtful, humorous, and insightful film, ""Heaven's Above"" is as near to an original clergy film as any in the last century. It is a step beyond satire - more of a hypothetical exercise. The difference between loving and absolutely loving the film depends completely on how the ending is received: (Should it have ended earlier? Is it a departure from the character? Too much farce?) Cinematography is splendid and witty, acting is thoroughly successful and the DVD transfer is crisp and rich. The biographical text on Sellers is interesting.

Sellers plays John Smallwood, a [forgive me] ""gospel-centered"" Christ-like pastor mistakenly assigned to a suburban parish whose rich, middle class and poor rival one another in exhibiting the ""devices and desires"" of their fallen hearts.  Malcolm Muggeridge appears briefly in an opening scene; he also (I believe I recall) had a hand in the screenplay.

It will throw a lot of people that Sellers plays a very straight role even though the film is a comedy wrapped around some very serious issues about religion and the establishment and human foibles. Knowing him from his later roles I sort of kept expecting him to be funny. But that was only a minor distraction. Yes the ending was a little weak, but not bad really. A bit overdone, but it certainly made the point dramatically that the Church establishment just had to get rid of him and that he was an unusually sincere man of faith.",1358899200,2,708,4.574803149606299
7974543,4,B00007AJE7,"""Heavens Above!"" (1963).  This  small, witty, 1960s black and white classic British comedy stars Peter Sellers as the Reverend John Smallwood, who had been an unconventional prison chaplain, and is mistakenly appointed vicar of the wealthy parish of Orbiston Parva, best-known for its local laxative factory.  Smallwood just can't help himself: he's gotta buck the conventional town's rigid expectations.  He insists on ministering to rich and poor alike; by doing so, he unwittingly shakes up the town's social order and infuriates everyone.

Sellers was born to a well-off English acting family: when he was a child, his parents worked in a theater troupe run by his grandmother.  He was well-known for liking to research his roles, and often basing his characters upon people he'd known in his life: sources say the Rev. John Smallwood is closely based on Brother Cornelius, one of the teachers at Sellers' parochial school.  Sellers was unquestionably one of the greatest comedians of the twentieth century, and though this film didn't have me rolling about on the floor with laughter, it's worth a butcher's (look) any day.",1297382400,2,3924,7.669623059866963
