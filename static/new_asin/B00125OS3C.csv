8243982,5,B00125OS3C,"We purchased your 'Colorado DVD' via Amazon. My wife and I watch the Colorado DVD in the morning with our coffee. Four Points Video REALLY captured the essence of Colorado, especially Rocky Mountain National Park [RMNP]. Colorado is our favorite place to vacation. We've been to Breck, Vail, Leadville, Winter Park, Denver, Colorado Springs and Estes Park. RMNP is without doubt our personal favorite(Bear, Sprague, Emerald, Nymph & Mills Lakes, Alberta Falls, Trail Ridge Road, herds of Elk everywhere and breakfast at Big Horn Restaurant in Estes Park). Four Points has truly presented the majesty that is Colorado. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION !!!",1217376000,,644,5.3861386138613865
8243983,5,B00125OS3C,"If you have experienced Colorado's beauty this work of art will speak to your soul.  If you have not seen Colorado, this video will inspire you to do so.  Our school shows relaxation videos throughout the day on the TV screen.  Colorado, The Beauty of It All is a favorite.  I find myself using the teachable moment to point out so many things like science concepts on animals as well as geology, weather patterns, etc.  Students experiencing stress seem to be calmed by Phil Giriodi's work.  I feel this video has shown many students the value of the relationship between mankind and nature. I have no doubt our students feel an increased responsiblity toward protecting the environment because they now have a personal relationship with our Colorado Rockies and all they hold.",1213056000,2,778,4.856060606060606
