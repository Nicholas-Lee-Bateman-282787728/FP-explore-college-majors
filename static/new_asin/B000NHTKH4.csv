8177741,3,B000NHTKH4,"It's always good to see Claire Bloom and Alan Bates in just about anything. It's especially intriguing to see the reliably dazzling Julie Christie play both a glamorous but brittle model, and then, completely against type, the mousy, desperately lonely, lovelorn daughter of a prudish, overbearing mother. John Schlesinger, who directed Christie in her Oscar-winning performance in Darling, brings out new facets of her as an actress.",1471564800,,434,5.492537313432836
8177742,2,B000NHTKH4,"I know this one is probably a classic, and I love Julie Christie, but couldn't finish watching it. Bored I guess.",1468540800,,113,4.428571428571429
8177743,3,B000NHTKH4,"The speaking language--British English--Is almost undecipherable and unintelligable. I'm a generic midwestern- born American with advanced degrees and could barely understand 60% of this play due to the various English accents, words be swallowed,etc. Sounded like mush in the mouths. Very frustrating.  I'll watch the old play again  on Amazon Prime with  past American and English actors mixed--everything understood. I really didn't like this at all--can't understand rave reviews. It was just boring with flat characters anyway.",1461283200,,532,5.883116883116883
8177744,1,B000NHTKH4,The tape I received is unplayable because of the soundtrack. There is a constant hiss and blip sound that makes it impossible to listen to the actors.  The tape is worthless.  I would warn other about purchasing this tape.,1442620800,,222,4.666666666666667
8177745,5,B000NHTKH4,"Love the David Niven version of this movie, so was eager to see it in it's original form.  It is different, but every bit as good.  As with the Niven movie, I prefer the Major/Sibil storyline, but this also worth a watch.",1434758400,,221,4.238095238095238
8177746,5,B000NHTKH4,"With its perfect casting and masterful direction, why, oh why, has this excellent presentation not been released on DVD???",1406592000,2,122,5.473684210526316
8177747,5,B000NHTKH4,"I am aware of three film versions of Separate Tables: this one with Julie Christie and Alan Bates; the version with Rita Hayworth, Burt Lancaster, and David Niven; and the BBC version. I definitely prefer this version with Christie and Bates. As other reviewers note this version conforms most closely to the play and requires both Christie and Bates to play two different roles. They are masterful and the effect is very powerful. Grab this version while copies are still available.",1394668800,6,483,4.9753086419753085
8177748,5,B000NHTKH4,"This is an excellent version of the Terence Rattigan play.  Unlike the (also excellent) film, this version is shown the way the play is done, i.e., Julie Christie & Alan Bates play dual roles, one couple in the first play and a completely different couple in the second (in the film Burt Lancaster & Rita Hayworth were couple #1, Deborah Kerr & David Niven couple #2).  Claire Bloom is also very fine as the hotel manager in both plays.",1378944000,6,436,4.506329113924051
8177749,5,B000NHTKH4,"This 1983 version of the 50's film is Exceptional with brilliant acting by Alan Bates & Julie Christie in dual roles, supported very well by Irene Worth and Claire Bloom. Very understated and gently directed by John Schlesinger for hbo, the film was nominated for hbo awards and the critics praised the acting.  There are two parts, two stories at this hotel, I found the first one good but the second story of Christie as Sybill with the overbearing mother Irene Worth and the sad ""Major"" Bates to be very moving. I fully recommend this film, feels like you are listening to and watching a first rate very well acted play.",1323475200,7,623,4.612612612612613
