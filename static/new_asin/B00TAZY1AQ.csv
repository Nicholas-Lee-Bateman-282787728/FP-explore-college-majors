8701169,5,B00TAZY1AQ,This was a good movie and it shows that even when your life and your world has turned upside down you can still make a change if you are persistent!

8701172,5,B00TAZY1AQ,"The film is excellent! It makes you feel a realm of emotions: cry, laugh, joke, serious, deadly, reality. If you reside or have been born to USA soil, our everyday life is so strange to the poor, abandoned, homeless, parentless children of Sudan. It is the lost children of Sudan who embrace their new lives in present day USA. It is worth view as Reese gives her usual stunningly, realistic performance. One cannot help but feel for all the children who were left behind. Ron Howard is a producer. I always enjoy all his films.",1435968000,,528,4.568421052631579
