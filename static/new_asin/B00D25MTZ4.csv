8588450,5,B00D25MTZ4,"Don't let the wording on the cover fool you.  This DVD can be played on a standard DVD player.  The price is very expensive but worth it.  I am very happy that Amazon.com and the seller is allowing these DVD's to be shipped to Canada and the US.  There is also audio in English as well.  If you are a B&B fan and you like old episodes, purchase this.  I hope Amazon will be able to sell box 1 and 2 to Canada.",1432166400,2,409,3.8674698795180724
