The African culture, food, houses, and even the music is very similar to that of our Caribbean culture.  They are very addicting to watch.  The first African movie which I loved so much that I purchased the sequels was: ""Beyonce.""  I have been hooked on them since then.",1296950400,,422,4.428571428571429

I laughed at the situation thinking that my mother bought home movie by mistake. My mother said that it was an African movie and that they were very good. A couple days later, I decided to see what this movie was about because I had nothing else to do. That was a smart decision. This was the first African movie that I watched and it was really good!

This movie was about a man (I can not remember his name in the story but the part is played by Van Vicker) who felt as though he must marry a wealthy woman in order for him to be rich. He had a beautiful girlfriend named Ruth. However, when she lost her job, he had left her. He was very determined to find the rich girl of his dreams. Not only did he want a girl with a nice car, house, and dressing style; he wanted his wife-to-be to have a well-off family background to bestow their riches unto him. So he goes on his search only leaving a path of heartbroken good, poor girls behind him until he finally finds his rich love. I strongly recommend watching to see how this movie flows. I believe that the main phrase that fits this movie is ""Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.""

Besides the lovely facial features of handsome Van Vicker, I enjoyed multiple things within the movie itself. I loved everything from the beautiful scenes within Africa to their music and culture. The scenic scenes of different places within Africa make me wish that I could visit there even the music is catchy. Being from a Caribbean background, some of the trees, roads, transportation and scenes in the village remind me of visiting my own country. Even my mother admits that she likes that fact that the movie reminds her of growing up on her island.

The movie is so just so different from American movies. I can not verbally express what I mean, but I will try. The actors within the movies express real emotion. Rarely in American films will you see black female actors act depressed to a point where that will cry where mucus will rundown their nose and would not wipe it. In addition, the African female actors will actually visually be depressed where their hair is undone where there is no weave and without any makeup. They will not even have the pretty, but depressed look. American films are the exact opposite. You would think that when women (the most emotional sex) are sad and depressed, they are not going to jump and do their makeup. They just received bad news; lip gloss is not the first thing on their minds. The emotion in African movies is high. In my opinion, this makes it more realistic. As stated before this is my first African movie and it was so good that it opened my door to the 60 (and counting) African movies that I currently own.",1218672000,2,2873,4.346368715083799
