7739882,4,B01ESNHBP6,"""Devlin"" was a lot more dialogue heavy and serious than most Hanna Barbera series of its time and the characters were rather realistic...when Ernie Devlin crashed his motorcycle, there wasn't any cartoonish effects or silly slapstick action.  He got hurt, plain and simple.

The Devlin kids (Ernie, Todd, and Sandy) worked for surrogate father figure and carnival owner Hank.  Ernie was the older brother who performed motorcycle stunts, Todd was the mechanic, and Sandy timed the stunts.  They travelled from town to town and encountered problems that Ernie's motorcycle riding skills would help save the day.  Expert voice work by Michael Bell as Ernie, Micky Dolenz as Todd, Michelle Robinson as Sandy, and Norman Alden as Hank.  The animation was disappointing in Ernie's motorcycle riding and jumping stunts as the product of its time...it always seemed the same people were the same spectators when the carnival travelled from place to place.

A flashback episode revealed the fate of the Devlin family's father who was a widower and a motorcycle police officer who was killed in the line of duty.  One image had the Devlin's dad racing to an emergency call during a winter storm and skidding to avoid an oncoming vehicle and crashing off screen to his death...rather powerful for a Saturday morning cartoon.",1465344000,11,1314,5.107476635514018
7739883,4,B01ESNHBP6,"Wow! Color me shocked this made it to DVD.  Is there really a demand for this toon? I cant believe they are going to release this.  This cartoon is definitely an acquired taste.  Its basically a PSA drama cartoon.  I don't think the kids will want to watch this.  I would say this cartoon was aimed at 10 years olds and older.  It only got 16 episodes in 74 and Im not really surprised.  Its very slow and boring at times.  I admit that upfront.  It also has a ton of talking but that is the point.  That being said I enjoyed watching this in the late 90s when it was on the Cartoon Network.  Ive never seen this cartoon or even heard of it before the late 90s but it really grew on me as it played every Saturday late night.  I was already an adult at this time so the concepts were not wasted on me.  I personally like PSA cartoons when they are done well.  This may be executed well but I get why it never caught on with the kids.  The only real action are the motorcycle jumps.  Its pure nostalgia for me.  Lets face it; Ernie Devlin is an Evel Knievel type character.  Before I even knew anyones name that is what made me take interest in this cartoon.  When I was growing up Evel Knievel was a household name and this cartoon tries to cash in of his fame in the form of PSAs for kids.  I had the Evel Knievel stunt bike with action figure that you revved up and let go for your jumping pleasure.  I had a lot of fun making ramps so I can see that baby go sky high.  Oh, the hours of fun with that.  This cartoon is worth adding to your Hanna-Barbera collection but I would say that this is for you only.  I cant see many children in todays climate enjoying this cartoon.  Give it a shot though.  You never know.  This is the norm with WB Archive now where you have 16 episodes spread out on 2 DVDs.  8 episodes a disc.  I must say that the transfer look extremely well for this old toon.  Maybe the Masters are in great condition or something.  I don't know but it looks excellent on my HDTV.",1464048000,7,1998,4.059125964010283
8759501,5,B01ESNHBP6,"I remember loving this animated drama series as an Evel Knievel obsessed 6 year old, so when I found out the series was available on DVD, I had to have it. It did not disappoint. Old school family friendly stories that usually work in an improvised motorcycle stunt to save the day and teach a moral lesson.",1530057600,,307,4.4035087719298245

Filmation is a favorite as well. Devlin is a personal treasure because it brings back the times when my bike was the coolest thing to have!",1485043200,,304,4.1525423728813555
8759504,5,B01ESNHBP6,"Most 70s era HB cartoons play a significant part of my childhood. Devlin is a stylish slice of pop culture and one I throughly enjoy! From the choice of colors, voice talent, and the induction of famous motorcycle stuntman, Devlin adds a perfect display of 1973.",1483056000,,262,4.717391304347826
