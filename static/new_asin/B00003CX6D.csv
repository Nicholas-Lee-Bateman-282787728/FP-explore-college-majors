1261820,5,B00003CX6D,"""Sunrise"" is a simple, touching story, beautifully told, about betrayal and redemption.  A farmer, tempted by his sophisticated mistress from the city, tries to kill his wife, but at the moment of truth he cannot do it.  The farmer and his wife rediscover their love, but then Nature throws in a surprise twist to test their happiness.  Within this framework, Murnau throws in bits of humor and imagination-- the knocked-down statue which they think they have broken because it doesn't have a head, the drunken pig which the farmer chases through the carnival.  Throughout, Murnau hardly needs intertitles because the visuals are so effective.
About the DVD:  I received it through Fox Studio's free offer in 2003.  The quality of the print is uneven and much more grainy than Fox's restorations of later films.  Sometimes it appears to be free of artifacts, but often you can see the scratches and blotches from the film negative.  There are two soundtracks.  The original score is in mono and the sound quality is decent.  The new score is in Dolby 2.0 and sounds much clearer.  Both scores match the movie very well and are worth listening to.
The DVD also has a lot of extra features.  The audio commentary by the cinematographer John Bailey is technical but informative.  For writers, you have the original scenario by Carl Mayer, along with the final screenplay.  Most uniquely, Fox has also included what remnants are available from Murnau's ""lost film"" called ""The 4 Devils.""  The narrated essay pieces the film together from production stills, drawings from the art director, and the screenplay, which is also on the DVD.
Overall, a masterpiece of visual storytelling and an oustanding DVD.  Kudos to Fox Studios.",1059350400,15,1722,4.968531468531468
1261821,5,B00003CX6D,"Although it's only available if you buy three other Fox Studio Classics releases, the DVD of _Sunrise_ is far and away the best of the series to date.
The video transfer features quite a few specks, some scratches and occasional missing frames.  That said, the restoration work on this film has been nothing short of phenomenal.  Original camera negatives were lost to a 1936 nitrate fire, and the only sources available for this film were a handful of brittle, decrepit prints.  Yet the image is frequently close to pristine quality. Audio tracks include the original, restored 1927 Movietone score -- recorded directly onto the film with an optical track -- and a more recent 1989 chamber-orchestra score. Both are worth a listen.
_Sunrise_ was the first Hollywood film from famed German expressionist director F.W. Murnau. He would direct two other films for Fox, but _Sunrise_ was the only one that would turn out to his satisfaction. It might even be Murnau's masterpiece.
Although the film's plot is fairly straightforward melodrama, its images are anything but simple. The overall effect is nothing short of rapturous. _Sunrise_ would go on to win three of the first Academy Awards, one of them a special honor for ""Most Unique and Artistic Production."" This award has never been offered since, which ought to say something.
Among the DVD's many extras are a thoughtful and knowledgeable audio commentary by cinematographer John Bailey, a copy of the film's scenario with Murnau's annotations, a gallery of stills and photographs, a trailer (which shows you what the film looked like _before_ it was restored), a few text-frame essays, and some interesting material relating to Murnau's second Hollywood film, the long-lost _Four Devils_.
The _Sunrise_ DVD presents, in the best form possible, a masterpiece of world cinema, along with special features that would do the Criterion Collection proud. Please, Fox, do film buffs a favor and give this DVD a wide release!",1046649600,13,1974,5.124223602484472
1261822,5,B00003CX6D,"In the late 1920's, there was some debate about which way the world of cinema would go.  Would it go with the new ""talky"" features in order to gain more audiences coming to ""hear"" films, or would silent pictures win out and maintain their hold.  Reminiscent of the current debate between film and HD as a shooting format.  So the producers and director created this film SPECIFICALLY to show what was still possible in the silent medium.  This film was created to show how much could be done with just action, visual motivation and light.  For those of you iffy on old silent films, believe me, I saw this in LA in a small cafe and I was blown away.  Yes I am a film student, but anyone would like this film.  It is important in terms of where it is in history, but the romantic story and gorgeous visuals are something that only existed in this way back then.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I am waiting for the DVD to come out so that we all can enjoy this incredible film. Director Murnau made a film full of magic through the skilled use of sets (with forced perspective), lighting, camerawork, and great performances (George O'Brien is terrific). Probably the best use of film to make what amounts to a visual poem. Now all we need is a good, clean DVD copy with a cleaned up soundtrack (or even a re-recorded soundtrack).

We saw it at the Pike Place Cinema in Seattle, several years ago and it instantly went onto my personal top twenty films of all time.  The characterizations are realistic and not overacted like some silent epics.  The cinematography is fabulous and the story line is both gut wrenching and heart rending and ultimately heart warming about the power of redemption through love and atonement.

1261826,5,B00003CX6D,"This movie's story is, when all is said and done, not that impressive. But Murnau's telling--or rather showing--of the deceptively simple tale is nothing short of breath-taking. Will a teenager watch it? Perhaps not without prompting, but most people I have met that have actually seen it think it marvelous, regardless of their age. O'Brien and Gaynor are perfect in their roles, but the real star is the camera. The textures and movement that the camera shares evoke a deep and enduring emotion in the viewer. Moreover, it is akin to Citizen Kane: It is a film that rewards multiple viewings with deeper appreciations and insights. Sunrise-A Song of Two Humans is a masterpiece, a haunting work to which every film lover should have unfettered access. It is an excellent example of how good the silent filmmakers were at their craft, and of how beautiful a black and white film can be. Whether it should be available on DVD is a question posed only by those wholly ignorant of the film's aesthetic charms.",995760000,10,1007,4.826589595375722

Just thinking about Sunrise makes me want to cry and laugh and rip my hair out.  Truely one of my favorite films of all time.  It is crazy that it is not available in DVD format.

1261911,5,B00003CX6D,"Be aware that there is a Blu-ray version.

I like most films of this time and Blu-ray (DVD Release Date: January 14, 2014) does it proud. I only watched the version that has the duel original European version and the Movietone versions (both silent with different inter-titles.) There are more expensive and intensive versions. One thing I found fascinating is that I try to get the screen play to various movies. This DVD version has the 130 page screen play built in.

This is not my favorite subject and I usually avoid movies of this type, of betrayal and redemption. I prefer ghoulies and ghosties. I also prefer war and peace or at least ""The Love of Jeanne Ney"" (1928). But because this film is a keystone in cinema it is required watching. I did see a part of this film prior in a survey ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" (2011) by Mark Cousins.

The film is based on a short story by Hermann Sudermann. ""This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere and at any time.""

A marriage is threatened when the husband (George O'Brien) allows himself to go astray after being lured by a woman (Margaret Livingston) from the city. There are a few tear jerker scenes after the Husband almost dispatches his Wife. He does not see the error of his ways until he thinks he has lost his wife (Janet Gaynor,) does he realize who he really loves? Yes. Who does he blame for his mishap? The ""Woman from the City"" for leading him astray, as it was not his fault.

I did like the scene in the photography studio where they look for the lost head.

You definitely want to listen to the voice over commentary by Cinematographer John Bailey as it adds worth to the viewing experience. The commentary points out the obvious that is not really that obvious. You discover that it was filmed at Lake Arrowhead. Also you bet a different prospective on Murnau's life story. John Bailey does not know where the `Amon Carter Museum"" is located, but we can forgive him as he presents an excellent commentary.

1261916,5,B00003CX6D,"In honor of our most recent Lead Actress Oscar winner, Jennifer Lawrence, I decided to finally watch Sunrise, the 1927 Oscar winner (Best Actress, Best Picture-Artistic Production, Best Cinematography).  If you recall, this delicate flower recently stated that she thought silent films were boring.  LOL, you have to love her crass and honesty, right?

I wasn't really familiar with what Sunrise was all about, but it had been sitting on my DVR for quite some time.  I remember months ago when it aired on TCM and I was kind of ecstatic because I had heard all sorts of wonderful things about it.  Heralded as one of the finest films of all time, even making Sight and Sounds top ten of all time this year (resting at #5), Sunrise was one that I most certainly wanted to make the time  to see.

Before the film began I listened to Robert Osborn and Drew Barrymore discuss the films importance and something struck me when Barrymore stated that the film was functionally progressive.  I don't know why, but those words hit me the minute she said them and then, throughout the film they kept coming back to haunt me.  I don't think I could have expressed my feelings for the film any better than those two words.  The film was so ahead of its time and really comprised itself of so many intricate themes and techniques that I was continually blown away by each passing frame.  Ive been a fan of the silent films for a long time, but this most certainly stands out among a slew of dominating films as one of the finest, if not THE finest ever made.

From the films opening title cards (brilliantly composed in a chalky white script) we are made aware that this is a story of no one and everyone at the same time.  The film sets itself up for a big fall in that regard because it is basically telling the audience that they WILL relate to this story.  It could have so easily failed after such a bold statement and yet despite some of the films more abrasive tricks, it works completely and one does feel this uncanny connection to the material and the resolve.

Telling the story of a young working class family torn apart by the roving eyes of the husband, Sunrise tackles the age old story of infidelity with a unique twist.  The husband, a simple farmer, is swept up in an affair with a lush woman from the city who was visiting his quant town while on vacation.  Shes lingered though, setting her sights on ruining his family.  She entrances the farmer and actually convinces him to kill his wife and run away with her.  It is there, on a boat, while he is hovering over his shaking and crying wife with his hands braced and ready to strangle her that he is struck with the realization that he loves her deeply and doesnt want to throw his life away for some tramp.  The film then takes a very sharp turn as it shifts from dark and disturbing murder plot to a night on the town as this husband and wife fall in love all over again.  It is such a beautifully detailed section of film that really enriches the films themes.  As the finale comes with crushing reality, we see the beautiful arc in these characters.

There are few films that can complete themselves the way that Sunrise does.

From a technical standpoint, as I mentioned, this film really was so far ahead of its time.  With the use of double exposures and elongated tracking shots and beautifully rich cinematography, Sunrise looks like no film the 20s produced.  It feels so modern and alive, even today.  The acting is sublime as well.  Janet Gaynor won an Oscar for this (as well as two other performances), but my eyes never left George OBrien, who just mesmerized as the emotionally tortured and morally confused husband.  Watching him come full circle was truly engaging and one of the more rewarding cinematic experiences of my life.

I cant recommend this film enough.  It is a true spectacle, a marvel of cinematic proportions that deserves to be regarded as a true masterpiece.",1361923200,,3952,4.531734837799718

1261987,5,B00003CX6D,"A song of two humans is the subtitle for this film and it rings true.  A man from the country is having a romance with a woman from the city who is vacationing in his town.  He loves her modern clothes, morality and love of excitement.  He is bored with his farm life, farm wife and new baby.  He dreams of a life with his new woman.  The woman dreams up a scheme, invite his wife on a trip to the city which is taken by boat.  On the boat he will toss her over and kill her, then they can leave together to live in the city forever.  His wife played by Janet Gaynor is aware of his love affair as is the community.  He lies to her saying that he wants to renew their marriage vows and take her on a trip to the city.  She is so overjoyed that she agrees immediately and asks her parents to take care of the baby.  Of course he tries to kill her on the row boat they take to the city but he can't go through with it.  They reach the city but she is terrified of him and cowers from him even when they are walking the streets.  After she fails to navigate car traffic which she can barely conceive and he saves her, she trusts him more.  He spends the day trying to make it up to her and getting her to enjoy the charms of the city.  Their relationship deepens over the course of the day.  On the trip back, a storm comes up and the boat is lost.  The man loses his wife to the waters.  The city woman is waiting for him.  The search for the wife take over the whole community.  What will they find?  This film is one of the greatest from FW Murnau, the director of Nosferatu, the greatest Dracula film in which Bram Stroker's widow ordered all copies destroyed due to copyright infringement.  It also was remembered because Janet Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Sunrise as Best Actress as well as two other films.  The film has been restored and shown in numerous venues.  There are many special features on the DVD.  Great commentary about the film by John Bailey a cinematographer.  The film won a Best Cinematography award too.  There are actually outtakes to see which is rare for a film of this age and a script to be shared.  The DVD also covers a film called the Four Devils which was lost.  The script for the film is included and with still photographs and drawings to put together a film of sorts.  A very interesting story.  What care was put into bringing this film back to life.

1261988,5,B00003CX6D,"Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans was a silent film which came out in 1927, only shortly before The Jazz Singer burst onto the scene and bringing talking to the movies. So it marks the end of an era, and it's considered by many to be the best silent movie ever made.

The movie is definitely powerful. Set in a dark, brooding landscape reminiscent of the moors of Wuthering Heights, we have the sweet, innocent wife and babe, and the moody, confused husband who is being seduced by the wild trollop of a city woman. While the wife is blonde, angelic, almost Mary-like with her sweet ways, the harlot has short, dark hair, wears high heels, smokes, and of course is willing to carry on with a married man. Not only that, but only moments into the film she is actively convincing him to kill off his wife so he can go to the city with her.

What follows is classic human nature. Will he kill his wife, or will he be overcome with guilt? How about the harlot?

It's a great idea to go into this completely unaware of what happens after that early setup. It makes all of the scenes play out even more powerfully, as you wonder what the next step will be. Some of them might seem a little unlikely - but that's OK. The movie is making a point, and I'm sure somewhere out there are humans will act in the way portrayed.

What's more impressive is the power of the visuals. The way the wife stares at the empty plate the husband leaves behind. The darness of the forest as the husband sneaks off to see the city woman. I'm only giving examples from early in the movie, of course, but there are a wealth of similar scenes later on.

Highly recommended as a movie that will suck you in, even nearly a century later.",1347580800,,1702,4.289719626168225

1261990,5,B00003CX6D,"SUNRISE is a lovely & very unique silent film. It is one I recommend to people who are new to the silent genre. Like many people, when I thought ""silent picture"" I envisioned people with dead white make-up, pounds of black eye-makeup & jumping around in spasmodic overacting. SUNRISE is one of the great silents that offers a whole different experience. For starters, the plot is ageless: handsome husband with loving, but rather dowdy wife, strays with cosmopolitan beauty. If you look at the CD cover you'll see what I mean.

George O'Brian could easily be the hunk next door today. He's both athletic & sensitive. I've never seen him before or since. Janet Gaynor is an excellent actress who, of course, went on to star in very successful ""talkies."" For example, she starred in the first version of A STAR IS BORN. Despite their almost polar opposite physical attributes (he is very tall & she is very short) the chemistry between them is unmistakable. There's a scene where they go to the Big City & get happily drunk (for the first time?) They do a  dance together that is hysterically funny & charming. THEN rowing a boat back home they get trapped in a raging storm. Here we see the full brilliance of German expressionist director F.W. Murnau & the film's outstanding special effects & cinematography.

There's also a scene near the end of the picture where the couple are making up. A group of well-wishers are gently warned away by a matron who knows best. The scene displayed a simplicity that was very touching.

SUNRISE is really a romantic epic & explores layers of relationship & cultural values. It is not expressionist, but realistic & very down to earth. I don't think I'd pay what they're asking to purchase, but I've rented it twice.",1320796800,2,1753,4.718954248366013

As much as I love old films, that's just too much to buy. For this kind of story, I'd rather see Quentin Tarantino's take on it, where the husband ends up in pieces and the women have it out in a duel.",1311379200,2,499,4.2631578947368425
1261992,4,B00003CX6D,"I really enjoyed this simple, straightforward classic from the twilight of the age of the silent movie. My main qualm with many speechless pictures, the title cards, are cautiously kept to a bare minimum - they're virtually non-existant in the third act - which results in a film that not only flows much more smoothly than most of its peers, but relies heavily on the performance of its cast. Fortunately, they deliver en masse. Janet Gaynor, who looks strikingly similar to Drew Barrymore, actually won the first-ever academy award for best actress for this film (and the two others she appeared in that year), deservedly so. Both she and her male counterpart, George O'Brien, were tirelessly emotive throughout, telling the story through exp'ression so it didn't need to be spelled out in text. It's also worth mentioning that, considering its age, I was blown away by the quality of the special effects in Sunrise, which were used ambitiously, but realistically, by the script. A bit over-the-top at times, it's more accessible than other films of its age and still deserves recognition as one of the best of the era.",1300579200,,1121,4.936507936507937

Above all, this is a film that simply must be seen without distraction.

1261994,5,B00003CX6D,"This beautiful painting of the joy and light found in a marriage during an hour so dark the external storm threatens one life while an internal one threatens the very soul of the other is today considered a cinematic masterpiece. William Fox made some excellent decisions regarding both the making and distribution of this film which often, and quite unfairly, get chided by critics rolling their eyes heavenward in delight at the mere mention of director Murnau's name, with whom a long love affair has been in play. While his artistic genius can be felt in Sunrise, a few directorial flourishes do not work. The artistic framing of light and space to mirror the sentimental love story haunted by darkness is magnificent. The insertion of expressionism is awkward in a couple of spots, however, as if a great artist painting a masterpiece in muted tones had suddenly decided to add a splash of color to call attention to himself, rather than his subject. An achingly beautiful performance by Janet Gaynor, and the decisions made by Fox, however unpopular they may be with critics, keep the painting in focus, making it a masterwork of silent cinema.

Trimming the film by 20 minutes, Fox rushed Sunrise into theatres to cash in on the artistic and commercial triumph of Frank Borzage's masterpiece, Seventh Heaven. The decision by Fox afforded Sunrise what little success it had with the public. Audiences flocking to Sunrise in order to see Seventh Heaven star Janet Gaynor, were again treated to another wonderful performance. They did not warm to the film itself, however, and Murnau's choice to make Gaynor a blonde and give her a spinsterish hairdo in order to contrast the pretty city girl was an example of the less than subtle hammer on nail approach of expressionism which was unnecessary. Borzage, understanding the feminine, had been willing to let Gaynor show her vulnerability through her performance without this artifice in both Seventh Heaven and Street Angel. Murnau did not. While Sunrise is often cited as the film for which Janet Gaynor garnered the first Academy Award, it was a combination of the two Borzage films and Sunrise for which she won. She was deserving in each film for her tremendous efforts onscreen, but it was most certainly Seventh Heaven, so wildly successful and beloved, which put the statue firmly in her hand.

George O'Brien gives an emotional performance full of angst as the simple farmer blinded to his diminutive wife's charms by a woman from the city. Janet Gaynor is moving in her loneliness, longing for her husband to return to his former self. Margaret Livingston's city girl has him in a sensual frenzy so complete, however, that even her suggestion to murder her and make it look like an accident cannot be refused. Murnau used light and spacing to create a beautifully realized atmosphere in harmony with the dark and light of the simple story line. O'Brien does an excellent job as a man so hypnotized by the forbidden fruit he's had, and the promise of more earthly delights to come once they break free, he becomes a tumultuous mess. His agony at what he finds himself about to do as their row boat leaves the dock is evidenced by his inability to even look at her. Gaynor is also wonderful here, filled with joy at just the slightest attention from her husband, then becoming fearful the further out to sea they get. Even the dog adores her, breaking free and sensing she is in trouble. It is her sweetness which begins to untwist the knot, but her horror at his betrayal has her running in fear even after the city girl's spell is broken.

It is now Gaynor who cannot bear to look upon her husband, a loving heart devastated that the man she trusted so completely had thought to take her life. Gaynor makes you feel her pain and want to comfort her, while at the same time O'Brien's efforts to win her trust and see his shame are equally moving. The city he had so dreamt about then becomes a magical place full of wonder as the couple slowly get back to who they once were amid a carnival and fireworks, a dance of life, and the heroic capturing of an intoxicated piglet. The art direction of Rochus Gliese and photography of Charles Rosher and Karl Struss shine in these scenes. Not only do they capture the playful joy of Gaynor and newfound happiness of a couple whose love has been renewed, but the magical setting which makes it all possible. The elaborate carnival especially provides a marvelous backdrop in which the couple can be framed in a romantic light, in stark contrast to the prior darkness. The stylistic carnival set was built in a diminishing perspective, making it appear to go on for blocks. The most moving of moments is a simple one in a church, however, with God's light streaming through the windows to frame a married couple as O'Brien and Gaynor break down. Tender and moving, and very similar to a scene in Seventh Heaven, which was released months before, it is followed by the couple walking out of the church as though it is they who had gotten married.

It is in this most basic and tender moment, however, that Murnau shows that flourish which, for a moment, threatens to tarnish this sweet, simple scene of beauty. A technical camera trick seems out of place and jarring as the couple cross the street. Gratefully, Gaynor and O'Brien pull the focus of Murnau's masterpiece back to its subject before the moment is irrevocably damaged through their sensitive portrayals. Rowing back home on a new day full of promise, the darkness returns in the form of a deadly storm which may bring things full circle, and fate into play. I won't ruin the conclusion for the few film fans unfamiliar with this lovely example of the silent art form, but will say without doubt that the ending Fox insisted on was the right one, filled with magic and tenderness. Lauded too much for the wrong reasons, and not enough for the right ones, it still adds up to a beautiful film and one of the finest from the silent era. I watched it with the original score option on the two disc restored set, and it was an arresting supplement to the visual and poetic story unfolding. Production decisions made by William Fox, a memorable characterization by George O'Brien, and a sensitive and adorable performance from Janet Gaynor, make this a must see film for anyone serious about the movies.",1279756800,,6360,4.732191163210099

The director's artistic vision was decades ahead of its time, and his screen composition was like a series of exquisite paintings, only paintings that move with poetry.",1273708800,2,337,4.540983606557377
1261996,5,B00003CX6D,"For his first American film, acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau was given the chance by the Fox Film Corporation to make any film he wanted, with complete artistic freedom and a blank check to do it with. The result was SUNRISE, a film that embodies the very definition of poetry in motion. Released in 1927, it is a beautiful example of the high degree of visual and emotional expression that silent films achieved just before the advent of sound.

SUNRISE takes a simple situation - the marriage of a peasant couple from the country (George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor), invaded by a seductress from the city (Margaret Livingston) - and raises it to the level of a fable. The film literally looks like an impressionistic painting done in a duotone palette of black and white. The pictorial harmony Murnau achieved is masterly - tracking shots, double exposures, expressive lighting, forced perspective - all of it comes together in such a captivating way that the viewer becomes emotionally immersed in the plight of these simple characters. The original Movietone music and effects track adds a dreamlike dimension to the film that spoken dialogue would be unable to evoke.

What makes SUNRISE so remarkable is how Murnau was able to turn the ordinary and the simple into such deeply moving images of power and beauty. One scene in particular that stands out in my mind comes at the end where the Woman of the City rides off in a carriage, forced to realize that she doesn't stand a chance against true love, just as the sun begins to rise on the horizon. What happens here is strange; even though she's the antagonist in the story, we somehow come to feel sorry for her. Murnau touches our sympathy for the Woman of the City by juxtaposing her feelings of dejection and utter defeat with the sheer, simple beauty of the actual scene itself, creating an emotional counterpoint. It's one of the most powerful - and at the same time -  bittersweet moments in the film because it's directly followed by the final shots of the couple, now happily united, bonded securely in their love for each other.

SUNRISE won three Oscars at the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1928: Best Actress (Janet Gaynor), Best Cinematography (Charles Rosher, Karl Struss), and a special Oscar for Unique and Artistic Production, the only time this award has ever been given. Today, SUNRISE remains an exquisite landmark in cinema history, one that every classic film lover should own.",1268352000,3,2461,4.838479809976247
1262027,5,B00003CX6D,"What can I add to so many glowing reviews?

Just that this deceptively simple film not only lives up to all of its praise, it's even better than that. If you've ever wanted proof as to the power of the silent film, then you'll find it here -- in its purity & depth of feeling, in its rich & evocative cinematography, in its fusion of pathos, suspense, darkness & shimmering beauty.

The story couldn't be simpler, in fact: The Man feels trapped, burdened by family responsibilities, as embodied by The Wife; and The Woman From The City is every temptation & fantasy wrapped up in a flapper's flimsy dress. A casual, sly suggestion that The Wife could somehow ""get drowned"" -- a chillingly detached way of putting it -- and the plot is in motion. What will it be -- a bottomless descent, or redemption?

As I said, the plot is simplicity itself. What makes the film so extraordinary is in how it's told, using both intense emotion & a surprising but effective amount of humor. Early films often presented an idealized vision of Love ... but this more than justifies every sentimental excess of other films, making its depiction of Love utterly convincing without every being heavy-handed.

The DVD itself looks lovely & comes with quite a few superb extras. The only thing wrong is that it's currently out of print & not easily available, which is a tragic mistake. ""Sunrise"" is 80 years old, but it puts the majority of films made since then to shame -- it urgently needs to be in print once more! Passionately recommended!",1247616000,4,1523,4.62962962962963

Legendary German expressionist F.W. Murnau brought his incredible talents to America and perfected the art of silent cinema with his film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. This classic from the late silent era is a story of a farmer, his wife, and a temptress from the city. Murnau takes a simple plotline and creates a film with great depth and passion. The film itself is beautifully acted and emotionally charged, but it's Murnau's direction and his cinematographers, Karl Struss and Charles Rosher, that make this one of cinema's most acclaimed treasures. It's brilliant use of composition, lighting, tracking shots, overlapping exposures, and long takes are nothing short of astounding. This is indeed a masterpiece.",1245715200,,877,5.1328671328671325
1262029,5,B00003CX6D,"Sunrise is a great 1927 classic that was recently featured on Turner Classic Movies. The central theme is the love and devotion that exist between a rural farmer and his wife. Initially, they represent the core of the stereotypical American dream by having a strong family unit that consists of their son, a maid, and an agrarian lifestyle that is reaching financial prosperity.

As often is the case, there is that proverbial serpent in this Garden of Eden who enters the scene in the form of a temptress. She is portrayed as a city woman who visits the countryside for an extended stay that will provide her opportunities to use her feminine wiles to lure any man into potential promiscuity. Unfortunately, for the aforementioned couple, the husband is the target of this villainess, who tries to coax him into having his wife permanently exited from the stage of life.

It is through the intermittent scenes that the viewer can almost gasp at how the development of minor seductions can entice people to potentially undergo drastic measures that are antithetical to their normal character. Despite these moments of unpleasantry, there are acts of resolution and redemption that hopefully will pave the way for a marriage that will solidify as a more tightly forged union.

Scenic are the views of both country and city landscape, as well as the cultural climate that existed back then. Ideally, one might say that F.W. Murnau, in large part, masterfully fused a silent documentary of life in 1920's Western society within an all-encompassing love story. One might notice that as the physical settings change, so do the dynamics that exist between the couple.

All in all, though fictional, Sunrise is the quintessential exposition of tested love and its duration. As laid out, there are no meandering, useless, pivotal points included that might cause the film to stray from its original theme. Limited to only a few key characters, one might say that Murnau executed the principle known as Occam's razor to create this masterpiece with a riveting storyline.",1243814400,,2061,5.017543859649122

The relationship between husband and wife O'Brien and Gaynor must be seen to be believed.  This movie, about forgiveness and redemption, is enhanced by the direction of F.W. Murnau, who blends a sombre German expressionism, as well as comedy, into this unique, American film.  There is also a fine performance by Margaret Livingston, who plays the other woman in the story.  This is a beautifully photographed, and well-preserved, motion picture that many viewers will want to see more than once.",1236902400,,618,5.089108910891089
1262031,5,B00003CX6D,"""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" was one of the last great silent films, released in 1927, the year that ""talkies"" debuted. William Fox of Fox Film Corporation had invited German director F.W. Murnau to make a film in Hollywood and given him carte blanche. Murnau took inspiration from the novella ""The Excursion to Tilsit"" by Hermann Sudermann, which Carl Mayer adapted for the screen. Sets in the Expressionist style were designed in Germany by Rochus Gliese, and the city and interiors were constructed on Fox's back lot in California. It was the most expensive silent film Fox would make. But ""Sunrise"" had a lackluster showing at the box office, where the imaginations of moviegoers had been permanently captured by the sound of a human voice on film.

This story of human temptation, betrayal and redemption is a visual tour de force that exhibits Murnau as a master of the cinematic arts with little competition. At the first Academy Awards in 1929, ""Sunrise"" won for Best Cinematography, Best Unique and Artistic Production, and was among the films for which Janet Gaynor was awarded Best Actress. Ironically, ""Sunrise"" is a sound film. It was one of the first films to use Fox's sound-on-film system called ""Movietone"". The film's score and sound effects by Hugo Riesenfeld were recorded onto the film in a manner similar to what we use now. A strip containing the sound information runs down the left side of the film, squishing the aspect ratio to 1.20:1. But the film has no dialogue and only spare intertitles.

As the story goes, it is summertime, when the countryside fills up with vacationers fleeing the heat and pace of the city. Among the displaced urbanites is a racy young woman (Margaret Livingston) who smokes, wears a negligee, and seduces a married farmer (George O'Brian), who neglects his peasant wife (Janet Gaynor) and young son to carry on an affair with his new worldly lover. The full implications of the tryst become clear when the Woman from the City suggests that the Man murder his Wife, sell his farm, and move to the city. The Man is torn, and thus begins the day that will forever change his relationship with his Wife.

Although the Woman from the City is a two-dimensional character with no redeeming characteristics, there only to represent temptation and immorality, the brooding farmer and his wife are drawn more roundly. And lest the audience think that Murnau associates morality and hard work with the peasants and vice and laziness with the urbanites, it isn't all bad in the city. The city is where the Man and his Wife renew their love. It also provides the opportunity for some comic relief, as a couple of amiable country bumpkins navigate the urban jungle. The actions of the characters are predictable, but ""Sunrise"" manages to build uncertainty and suspense into their relationship nevertheless.

""Sunrise"" is an icon of great cinematography, perhaps unmatched in its beauty and impact even today. Murnau's moving camera, in the hands of Charles Rocher and Karl Struss, is strikingly fluid and dynamic, his double-exposures suggestive and natural, if that's possible. I found it extraordinary that the city and even the incredible marsh were constructed on a back lot. The only location filming was of the lake, which was Lake Arrowhead, on which the village houses were constructed. The trolley car that the Man and Wife travel connected the lake location to the back lot by rail, and we can see the intervening journey in the film. It's unbelievable even as I watch it more than 80 years later. ""Sunrise"" is an incredible example of what purely cinematic, silent film could do before film structure was governed by scenes and scenes revolved around dialogue.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2003 Limited Edition): You may choose to watch the film with the original Movietone score (mono) or a score composed and conducted by Timothy Brock, performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra (stereo). I found this second, later score overbearing after hearing the first one. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French. There is an illuminating feature commentary by ASC cinematographer John Bailey, who comments primarily on the cinematography by Charles Rocher and Karl Struss, locations, how scenes were filmed, light sources, set design, etc, rather than saying much about themes. Mr. Bailey also lends his commentary to several Outtakes or rejected scenes (10 min) which were taken from a workprint. You can choose between listening to Bailey talk about the Outtakes or reading his commentary on text cards.

There is a theatrical trailer (2 min), and you can page through the ""Original Scenario by Carl Mayer with Annotations by F.W. Murnau"" (text), and the ""Sunrise Screenplay"" (text), which is a shot-by-shot plan for the film. There are ""Restoration Notes"" (text) that explain that both image and sound on this print have been digitally restored from a 1936 print held by MOMA. And there are 3 ""Still Galleries"": Advertising (3 images), Behind-the-Scenes (13 images), and Production (29 images). I have not heard this mentioned by any other reviewers, but my disc has the silent version of ""Sunrise"" on Side B. This was created for those theaters in the US and Europe which were not equipped to play Movietone films. This print has a slightly wider aspect ratio, and the opening titles and intertitles are in Czech, with optional subtitles in English. I believe it has the Timothy Brock score.",1230163200,3,5448,4.994493392070485
1262032,5,B00003CX6D,"The unfortunate thing about the release of SUNRISE in 1927 was that it preceded by weeks the release of THE JAZZ SINGER. So technical innovation trumped artistry, at least in the minds and hearts of the movie going public. Although not a commercial success, SUNRISE was a critical success and won several Academy awards in the 1st year they were awarded, including best cinematography, best actress (Janet Gaynor), and most artistic production. After watching a movie like SUNRISE you can well understand why Charlie Chaplin was so reluctant to switch from silents to talkies. SUNRISE says so much visually, that words are superfluous.

The story itself is quite simple, but the way it is told is not. Many groundbreaking techniques were used in the cinematography and set design. The camera movements, use of light and shadow, and montage effects, anticipated films like CITIZEN KANE, and influenced the work of directors as diverse as Frank Borzage, John Ford, and Raoul Walsh. But SUNRISE is more than just eye candy. Murnau took the German Expressionism he helped perfect in films like NOSFERATU to a new level of sophistication. The visuals create mood, and reflect the thoughts and emotions of the characters. There are at least half a dozen episodes in this film that are so astounding visually and emotionally that they send shivers down your spine.

SUNRISE is a great parable painted cinematically by a great master. It's a beautiful movie that deserves it's exalted place in the history of film. Do yourself a favor and get this DVD, or watch it the rare times it is shown on TCM.",1227139200,2,1591,4.932835820895522

Though a Hollywood production, Murnau conveys a distinctly Germanic atmosphere, with superb cinematography by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss. Sadly, Murnau's premature death in 1931 deprived viewers of his enormous potential in the sound era. Like many silent classics, ""Sunrise"" was critically admired yet a financial failure.

1262034,4,B00003CX6D,"This magnificent silent film won the Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production at the very first Academy Awards.  It is worth watching. Some silent films can put you to sleep, not this one, it packs a punch.

Briefly, the story is about a young married couple, that farm near a lake.  The husband (George O'Brien) has an affair with a vacationer--""a girl from the city"".  This woman talks him into drowning his wife, but making it look like an accident.  She makes him a bundle of ""bulrushes"" (lake plants) that, I guess, were the first type of natural life preservers.  She explains that he could swim, with this to safety when he overturns the boat. He agrees to all this and heads back to his farm house.  The next morning he takes his wife out on the fateful boat trip, but has a change of heart.  After he convinces her(Janet Gaynor) not to be afraid of him, the couple have the best time ever and after a night of fun, head back to their home on the their boat.  The weather takes a turn for the worst and he ties the ""life perserver"" to her.  The boat indeed overturns and he makes it to shore alone.  After a bunch concerned people search the lake for her, they return, believing she drowned.  The upset husband retreats to their home.  The ""other woman"" shows up and he gets angry and starts to strangle her only to be stopped by people who found his wife alive---saved by that life perserver his girlfriend made!

This movie was filmed in Big Bear Lake, California in 1927.  The scenery was beautiful and very well composed.  The picture quality is excellent and well reproduced.  The first home I owned was in Big Bear Lake (just sold it last year), and I never saw it that pristine!  It's a beautiful mountain lake.

This movie is a must for any collector of old classic films.  A good friend passed this gem onto me and I'm glad he informed me of it's credits.",1215734400,4,1880,4.409883720930233
1262035,5,B00003CX6D,"The other reviewers have well described the movie's plot and many merits. I would only echo what a visual masterpiece this movie is.  While the story is as simple as a children's tale, the movie is totally engaging on several levels. This is testament to the genius of the director F.W. Murnau and the movie's photographers.

The settings in this movie do not feel like movie sets, rather they feel like they must be real places, yet they have this strange otherworldly quality that signals some lost time and place. It is a feeling I can only compare to classics of modern sci-fi - like Blade Runner or 2001.

Throughout the movie, I kept watching the inventive cinematography and saying - how did they shoot that scene? There are dozen of examples, but one I would mention as most intriquing was a single continuous shot (it goes on for several minutes)of the George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor characters traveling from the countryside to the city in a tram. I cannot recall ever seeing a continuous shot of this length in a moving vehicle.  The DVD provides the explanation about the shot and I found it fascinating.

This brings me to the one extra feature on this edition that I really wish to commend, and that is the commentary by cinematographer John Bailey. Bailey walks you through the entire movie explaining why the sets look the way they do, how most of the shots were done, and why they were done that way.  He does an excellent job of explaining what German expressionism was about and its influence on Murnau and the film. I found his commentary extremely compelling and it ties together the movie you see on the screen with the vision of the director.  Interestingly, Bailey admits that modern day cinematographers are still not quite certain how Murnau realized a number of the shots.  His commentary was like sitting in on a great film class.

In watching Sunrise, you have to marvel what could be accomplished in movies with just film, a camera, ingenuity and imagination. It is humbling also to consider that 80 years ago, for a dime or two, the public could go see a movie that was both entertaining and high art. You will pay more than that if you want to see this movie now, but it's surely worth it.

Finally, I would note that I purchased this in the 20th Century-Fox Studio Classics Box with How Green Was My Valley, Gentlemen's Agreement, and All About Eve.  That is a good deal even if you only like one of the other films.",1211587200,5,2450,4.583524027459954
1262036,4,B00003CX6D,"Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (F. W. Murnau, 1927)

In the days of Technicolor and high-powered CGI special effects (well, when they're not low-budget CGI special effects), it's sometimes hard to understand how the effects to be found in the earliest films can still be effective. Not so with Sunrise, F. W. Murnau's first Hollywood film, and the only one to ever win the discontinued Oscar for Best Unique and Artistic Film. (A category which, I firmly believe, needs re-instituted.) It's a simple story; a vacationing woman (Margaret Livingston) tempts a farmer (George O'Brien) to kill his wife (Janet Gaynor, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance), leading to a re-examination by the farmer of his marriage, which he had believed had grown stale and loveless. The story, however, is not the reason to watch this; it is, as its Oscar category would imply, a stunning film. Murnau was known for having a strong vision of how a film should look in his head, and then going and inventing new movie technology in order to achieve that vision. There's nothing here as outrageous (for the time) as his invention of what we now know as the Steadicam (which he came up with for 1922's Nosferatu), but there's quite a great deal of camera trickery going on. In addition, the outdoor location shooting is wonderful; the mist in some of the early scenes looks more real here than it does in many modern films (noting, of course, it's probably real in both cases).

As well, this is one of those silent films that makes me wonder why modern movies need so much dialogue. It's obvious what's going on without us ever hearing the characters say a word, and with not a great many titles scattered about. We see more in the crook of an eyebrow than we hear in five minutes of dialogue in most movies.

While it faded into obscurity for decades, a new generation, myself among them, have discovered Sunrise, and it has recently started being routinely included on 100-best-movie lists. Deservedly so, and one thinks that perhaps many modern directors could learn a great deal more from Murnau than they already have. ****",1205107200,3,2120,4.755434782608695
1262064,5,B00003CX6D,"Most of films of the great directors are multidimensional in its significance. This immortal gem of the cinema couldn't be the exception.

On one hand, it may be regarded as a romantic triangle with attempts to murder, but this reading would be flat, because Murnau pursuits to surmount the simple anecdote; in this sense the arrival to the city and the arouse illusions as guarantee of a new and better world to live remains in our minds afeter leaving the hall.

But the difference is the transcendence of this brilliant movie resides in the purity and if you may naf convictions of this couple that keeps a curisous resemblance with Tabu. Because to emigrate from the province to the big city it's not so far respect to emigrant from a paradisiacal island to the modern civilization. Moreover, if we scrutinize with major zealousness around the origins of the Italian  Neo realism, most of critics agree in Jean Renoir's Tony was the first seed, but this story is narrowly linked ij spirit and intention with this movement.

This film still stands out as one the most superb movies ever made; a portentous artistic document for the new filmmakers to come.",1187568000,,1158,4.8040201005025125
1262065,5,B00003CX6D,"Never had a silent film struck so loud a chord as that which is made in ""Sunrise"".

Directed by FW Murnau and released by Fox Films (before they merged with 20th Century Studios), this is one of the most impressive films of the silent era. If ""Citizen Kane"" showcased all the tools in the filmmaker's box in the early sound era, this does the same for silent films.

The plot is deceptively simple. A Man, who lives on a farm with his wife, A Woman, and their son, A Child, meets a A Woman From the City (no one has names in this... really!). He has an affair with her, and she eventually convinces him to kill his wife so they can sell the farm and move to the City to live. She concocts for him a plan where he rows his wife out into the middle of the lake they live near and drowns her.

The Man agrees to this plan, but when the time comes, as he looms over his wife and she cowers in fear, he finds he can't do it, and the two travel to the City together, where they are reminded of why they fell in love in the first place.

As said, the plot is somewhat simple, but the same cannot be said for the direction and the sets. Murnau, famed for movies such as ""Nosferatu"" and ""Faust"" was hired by William Fox to come to America and make four movies, of which this was the first (and probably the best, though ""Four Devils"" was supposed to be sensational and is, alas, a Lost Movie).

Murnau, who was a major force in German film, brought to the studio all his gifts as a filmmaker. When you watch the movie look at the early trick photography that was used to create a split-screen view (they put tape on one side of the film, shot that image, and then put tape on the other side and shot that image to crea a split-screen effect), or watch the way the camera follows the Man as he goes to meet the Woman From the City out near the lake.

Just as amazing are the sets, surreal and grand in their design. Look at the first view of the City, where you see an amazing street view, with impossible angles that can't exist in real life. A lot of this was accomplished by having painted sets with normal adults in the foreground and midgets and children in the background to give an illusion of largeness.

To call it a silent film isn't really even accurate. At this point Hollywood had began to experiment with early sound technology, and ""Sunrise"" actually had a soundtrack, though it was composed entirely of music and limited sound effects. It won't blow away your sound system, but it adds a nice touch, particularly when a tune familiar to all begins to play. You won't know it by name, but it's called ""Funeral March of the Marionettes"", and you've heard it before, trust me.

""Sunrise"" was nominated for awards at the very first Academy Awards. It went home with Best Actress for Janet Gaynor (who later said had she realized how important the award would become, she would have enjoyed it more, rather than swooning over Douglas Fairbanks as he gave it to her), and an award for ""Special Artistic Achievement"", which was never awarded to any other movie. For the curious a film called ""Wings"" took home Best Picture and is widely regarded as very inferior.

The film is both easy and impossible to describe. It really needs to be witnessed for itself. Your local Blockbuster won't have a copy, but the library probably does (though probably on VHS). The film was released a couple years ago on DVD as part of 20th Century Fox's ""Studio Classics"" line. Sadly, though, they didn't give it a general release and you had to send in proofs-of-purchase from other DVD's to get it. Or you can do what I did, and buy a copy off Ebay for about $15. It's well worth it.",1169424000,3,3665,4.330903790087463
1262066,5,B00003CX6D,"There is nothing special about the story behind this movie. A farmer (George O'Brien) is attracted by a vamp from the City (Margaret Livingston) who seduces him and has gradually had him selling his farm off piece by piece to provide presents for her. She finally suggests that he leave his failing farm altogether and return with her to the City. However, to complete the plan, he will need to drown his country wife(Janet Gaynor). A few days later, the farmer takes his wife for a trip to the city. As he rows his wife across the lake that is between their village and the trolley, he comes close to doing away with her. However, always a reluctant partner in this plan, he recoils in horror and rows the boat to the shore, his wife unharmed. The wife, having seen the murder in her husband's eyes, jumps onto the trolley to the city with her husband in hot pursuit. Once in the city, he reassures her that he would not harm her, and he begins to feel real remorse for his previous actions. They slip into a church and watch a wedding ceremony going on, and in doing so begin to reconnect to one another. By the end of the day, they've fallen in love again; the man remembering why it was he married his wife in the first place. However, when a storm breaks out on their way back across the lake, the wife falls out of the boat. The farmer goes for help and the entire village looks for her, hoping she has not been drowned in the storm. This simplistic story could easily have been transformed into a hackneyed melodrama. What makes Sunrise a great film, though, is the majesty and tenderness F.W. Murnau managed to give it without the benefit of audible conversation.

Particularly intriguing is the set of the unnamed ""City"". If the traffic patterns shown in this movie are indicative of traffic laws in the 1920's it's a wonder anybody made it to or from work alive. Early autos, horse-drawn carriages, and people all chaotically race through the streets without rhyme or reason. Also wondrous are the night shots of the Coney Island-style amusement park where the farmer and his wife go for some fun before returning home as well as the view of the trolley ride and and the glide following the farmer through the moonlit marsh. This truly was the ""Best Artistic Picture"" of the year.

A little known fact is that Sunrise was the first feature film to use sound-on-film techniques. There were fully synchronized sounds of automobiles, church bells, crowds, and other effects. Unfortunately, ""The Jazz Singer"" was released shortly after Sunrise, and Sunrise failed at the box office. Time, however, has had a different judgement. Today, ""The Jazz Singer"" is mainly remembered for ushering in the age of the talkie. Likewise, ""Wings"" which won the first Best Picture ""Oscar"", is largely remembered for its aerial stunts, for which it also won an engineering award. Sunrise, however, is still appreciated as a whole motion picture experience, not just a temporary technical triumph that has faded as other technical triumphs take its place.",1166572800,3,3043,4.7180451127819545
1262067,4,B00003CX6D,"Sunrise is one of the most beloved silent films of all time. Although it might not be as well known as Chaplin's comedies, it is a highly artistic drama and proof that the silent era film makers were capable of greatness. The story surrounds a man and a wife who used to be inseparable and completely in love. A woman from the city tore them apart and now he is contemplating murdering his wife to be with his lover. However, his love for his wife, no matter how much the city girl overshadows it, is stronger than anything else and makes it impossible for him to betray her.

This film is very artistic and won a special Oscar for its achievements. It certainly is one of the most advanced of the silent era and was made in a year when films were at their pinnacle. The blue screen use is a bit obvious, but advanced for the time period. Also, the use of cross-cutting and other trick photography makes the movie fun to watch outside of the storyline. Even the title cards are artistic with a strange font and animation. There is also the use of sound effects outside of the normal music score.

Aside from these things, the film is impressive because of the acting. Janet Gaynor won the best actress Oscar for her performance (against two of her other wonderful roles). Her sweetness and deep hurt radiate over the screen. George O'Brien plays excellently off of her and brings a complex character to life.",1165968000,5,1408,4.49609375
1262068,5,B00003CX6D,"Even though there are heavily melodramatic moments as well as trivial, excisable ones (note the runaway pig), this 1927 masterwork by German expressionistic filmmaker F.W. Murnau is still an impressive piece of silent cinema released just days before the arrival of the breakthrough talkie, ""The Jazz Singer"". It does seem a shame that the sound revolution made films as expressive as ""Sunrise"" obsolete just as film auteurs like Murnau, Chaplin (1931's ""City Lights"") and Carl Theodor Dreyer (1928's ""Le Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"") were reaching their artistic peaks. ""Sunrise"" is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand how emotionally resonant silent cinema can be when directed by a master of the form.

Adapted by Carl Mayer from a German short story, the fable-like plot revolves around three unnamed characters - a farmer, his wife and a woman from the city. Feeling stagnant in his marriage, the farmer embarks on an affair with the city woman who is on holiday in the country. The melodramatic elements of the story fall into place as the woman suggests the farmer kill his wife and sell his farm to move with her to the city. He nervously goes through the steps to take his wife out on a boat in order to drown her in what he will design as an accident. His true feelings for his wife intervene but not before his wife, realizing his intention, runs away into the city. He chases her and makes amends, and together, they have a spirited, romantic adventure in the city. With their marriage solidified, they encounter a storm when they take the boat back to the farm, and then fate takes its hand on the three characters.

The most startling aspect of the movie is the visual element which carries through the same stylized exaggeration of Murnau's German classics, ""Nosferatu"" and ""The Last Laugh"". Far more than the simple storyline or even the acting, the shimmering cinematography by Karl Struss and Charles Rosher and the impressive art direction headed by Rochus Gliese are what resonate today, as they all serve to add emotional weight to what is essentially an anti-adultery parable. The most impressive sets are of the realistic-looking city captured with all its pervasive impatience and scarifying traffic, and in particular, the Luna Park amusement park abuzz with futuristic rides and hedonistic crowds. A couple of impressive scenes involve the farmer and his wife oblivious to the traffic as they rekindle their love amid honking horns and piling vehicles.

Overall there is an impressive use of deep shadows and exaggerated set pieces to mirror the inner feelings of the characters. Even though it is a silent, the soundtrack on the DVD has the original orchestral score and effective sound effects to help bring another dimension to the story. Just twenty years old, Janet Gaynor uses her innocent manner and porcelain look to strong advantage as the wife, but it is the little-remembered George O'Brien who turns in the film's most powerful performance as the farmer, especially in his guilt-ridden plea for forgiveness outside the church where they witnessed a wedding. To her credit, Margaret Livingston plays the other woman with relative subtlety even though she is dolled up as a Louise Brooks-look-alike flapper.

The 2003 DVD has a terrific set of extras starting with informative commentary by cinematographer John Bailey, a protege of the film's main cinematographer Struss. He also contributes remarks to ten minutes worth of outtakes that have been miraculously saved in the studio vaults. There is a forty-minute partial reconstruction of Murnau's 1928 lost film with Gaynor, ""Four Devils"", made up completely of stills and drawings and a narrative track. Production stills and the original trailer for ""Sunrise"" complete the extras.",1146528000,3,3783,5.086956521739131

1262071,3,B00003CX6D,"Sunrise is the filmic equivalent of entering a sauna and getting splashed in the face with a bucket of ice water... then enjoying the sauna before getting splashed in the face with another bucket of ice water.

It starts out very German Expressionist and horrific, with a city woman dressed in black convincing a farmer to kill his wife so that he can run away to the city to be with her.  For a while, it stays on this roller coaster as he finds himself unable to do it and, following his wife as she flees to the city, tries to pull together his fractured emotions and stop her from demonizing him.

Yet at that point it becomes a tender love story with a lot of light comedy.  The expressionistic elements are still there, but everything is clean and happy and easily resolved.  Even the carnival they go to has nothing weirder than a drunk pig.  But it's not like it can stay that way, because there's death and lust and insanity hanging over them, so eventually it kind of has to head back to getting really crazy again.

It doesn't really work for me.  I can't speak for anybody else in this case, but this film jostles and sends my emotions trying to keep up from one extreme to the other so quickly that it eventually just leaves me uncomfortable with the film itself.  This is unfortunate because for one thing, the imagery and craft behind this film is absolutely amazing, and for another thing, it's so good at being insane during the insane parts, tender during the tender parts, and absurd during the absurd parts.  It's just that nothing seems to tie everything down enough for my tastes, as if I had watched three different shorts and accidently thought they were the same disjunctive movie... only they are the same movie.

Obviously, it's very good if it can send my senses reeling like this.  I have to admit that, plus the fact that the camera and editing techniques are amazingly detailed and distinct.

I'm guessing I probably didn't get it.  I am, after all, writing this after my first viewing.

1262073,5,B00003CX6D,"SUNRISE --- directed by F.W.Murnau --- was a commercial flop when first released in 1927, but is now recognised as one of the greatest, if not the greatest Silent Film ever made. Depending upon which books you read, it rivals Carl Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC as the No. 1 Silent Film. Upon its release it met with almost total disdain from the American public who could not relate to the brooding Germanic atmosphere, and the simple, almost banal story.

A peasant farmer is seduced by the Woman from the City who talks him into drowning his wife and running off to the Big City. The farmer tries, when rowing across a lake, but just cannot do it. The wife flees in terror, jumps on a trolley-car and rides to the City, with the farmer just sitting staring at her.

This sequence is one of many fabulous "" mood setters "" in this film, and is one of Silent Cinema's most famous sequences, as the rural lakside, country pastures silently turn into the outskirts and then the centre of the City.

The rest of the film concentrates upon their gradual re-awakening to each other and then one the way home, across the lake by moonlight, fate takes a sinister and totally unexpected hand, leading to an emotionally heightened climax. If you are of intellectual bent, you could sneer at this beautiful and haunting film ... but if you are an emotionally responsive person, you will need a large box of tissues ............

Janet Gaynor who plays the Wife, won the Academy's very first Best Actress Award, ( although it was not called that at the time ). The film is famous for its brilliant atmospheric camera work and brilliantly set mood lighting .... especially the Man's tramping through the swamp to keep his moonlight tryst with the seductive Woman.

Not only did the public not understand this film, but its release by 20th Century Fox was unkowingly very ill-advised. Just a few weeks after the release of SUNRISE, Warner Bros flung THE JAZZ SINGER on to the world ... and the rest, as we all know, is cinematic history.

Another note of historical and scholarly interest is that SUNRISE is actually the FIRST feature-length film in which the human voice is heard. Many films up to this time had recorded musical soundtracks and sound effects. In SUNRISE, when the Wife and the Man reach the end of the trolley-car in the middle of the bustling and fast moving traffic in the City, the wife jumps out in fear and runs right into the middle of the traffic which seems to be going in all directions. You hear on the soundtrack, motor horns blaring and ther angry cries of motorists -- "" get off the road"", what do you think you are doing ? "",  "" get outta here "", etc. But not too many people heard it and a few weeks later THE JAZZ SINGER was released and .. we ain't heard anything, yet.

Another "" claim to fame "" of this film is that it is also considered to be the "" grandaddy "" of film noir, with its look and feel firmly set in Germanic Expressionist mode, and the birth of the femme fatale in film noir.

This sublime, beautifully filmed and sensitivly, sincerely acted film is one that will haunt you for a long time after viewing, and you will want to see it again and again.

And now we can in this MAGNIFICENT DVD transfer from Twentieth centry Fox. The film has been miraculously restored and remastered. All the prints I had seen previously and elsewhere, and the VHS videos I have of it from the USA and the UK are all faded and fuzzy, though very watchable and understandable. But now this DVD offers SUNRISE as it has never been seen before -- except perhaps upon its original release. Now we can see the lighting effects as they are presented in those beautiful photographs in film books. Now all levels of this are perceived and the viewing becomes an unforgettable cinematic experience.

With this DVD  you have a choice of two soundtracks. One being the original Movietone soundtrack, and the other being a modern composition. I personally prefer the original. Firstly because that is the way the film was presented and meant to be seen. I also found that the other soundtrack eliminated the original sound effects, and unfortunately for my taste, like most other modern compositions to accompany Silent Film, the films seem to exist merely to accompany the new musical soundtrack and NOT vice-versa.

There is also a silent trailer for the film, and that is a novelty ... and other features to make this a treasured DVD in any collection. The one about the set designs and establishment of mood and matching shots is fascinating.

This is one of the greatest films, offered on one of the greatest DVD transfers around. if you love and know Silent Film, you won't need to be told to buy this DVD. If not sure, just buy it anyway. You won't regret it. I bought it -- ( I actually have two, one is a backup ), and watched this film over and over again.

Thank you Twentieth Century Fox for reincarnating and helping countless numbers of people to discover and re-discover this mesmerising and unforgettable film.",1106784000,4,5038,4.563676633444075

1262123,5,B00003CX6D,"I largely agree with William T. Jameson.  What modern viewers don't realize is how influential this film became in Hollywood.  If Murnau had lived longer, he might have become as powerful a force in movies as Hitchcock became, and it would have been largely due to the fact that both trained in German silent cinema techniques, which involved evocation of mood from pictoral composition and set lighting.  After Sunrise, feature after feature capitalized on or borrowed one or another of the many effects Murnau invented.

Today, the scholarly view says that with this film Murnau invented the ""Woman's Picture.""  A new genre?  Makes no sense to me if you look at so many of Griffeth's features.  Nevertheless, as beautiful as Daybreak is, it is revolutionary in the sense that it is an unusual display of cinematographer's craft in the sence that most of the takes are extremely long, establishing a kind of visual rhythm that carries us, as a musical theme does, through the story that is simple, overall, but profoundly complex in its details.

A great, emotional masterpiece.  Nobody who wants to build a cinema library should be without a copy.",1096675200,,1149,4.942708333333333
1262124,5,B00003CX6D,"It baffles me why Fox hasn't released this in any other form except for the now-expired buy-3-get-it-free offer (although their misleading website won't tell you that this offer is no longer valid).

the film Sunrise is enigmatic to describe.  sure, you can give a simple plot synopsis: farmer struggles with the temptation to drown his wife, only to fall in love with her again through a series of events, including the dramatic conclusion where he almost loses her in a storm.

however, the movie really needs to be experienced to truly understand why it is such a masterpiece.  amazing cinematography makes this the peak of the German expressionist movement.  camera angles and techniques are here a perfected science that turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.  the commentary reveals more about the staging than you could ever catch on your own, such as where miniatures end and reality begins.  and while movies today usually have all of their special effects clearly analyzed, the amazement of many silent movies, like Sunrise, is that we still don't know for sure exactely how some of the effects were achieved.

special effects are surprising, for an otherwise unremarkable melodrama that doesn't seem to call for any special effects.  in the hands of anybody else, the script would have been a potential disaster.  Murnau was, however, the true star of all of his films, most notably because none of his movies are really star-vehicles.  his moves were simply great regardless of who was playing in them.

i think one thing that hasn't been mentioned enough are some of the amazing extras on this DVD.  even though Murnau's Four Devil's is a lost movie, the entire story is retold from surviving production elements: stills, drawings, and the script.  it's certainly an unconventional way to show a movie, but it's an amazing glimpse into a film that may never be seen again.  interestingly, the Four Devils comprises a good percentage of the disc, enough to merit its own DVD release.  it would be great if other lost films could be retold in this manner, similar to the restored ending of Sadie Thompson.

this movie desperately needs to have a real release.  it's a real tragedy when great movies are in the hands of studios that just don't know what to do with them.",1094083200,5,2284,4.888311688311688
1262125,5,B00003CX6D,"'Sunrise' is a film that explores many human emotions and frailties.  The plot is as old as drama itself, that of an unfaithful husband (George O'Brien) who is lured by an exotic, worldly-wise woman (Margaret Livingston) and tempted to dispose of his faithful, unsuspecting wife (Janet Gaynor) in order to free himself to be with the object of his desire.  The setting for the film is an idyllic European countryside, stylised to the point of becoming almost universal in appearance.  Murnau seems to be saying to his audience, 'This could happen anywhere, to anyone, even to you.'

Appearances were of supreme importance to Murnau, and this film is his masterpiece.  He brings you into the palm of his hand, so to speak, through skillfull manipulation of scene and action, from the point where O'Brien, completely under the spell of the Woman From The City is almost convinced to drown his wife, to when the couple visits the City and come to recognize their affections for each other, and then on to when an ironic twist of fate turns joy into disaster.

Murnau takes his characters through their paces and puts his audience into the thick of it. We are brought to feel with and for the couple, and in the process come to recognise a bit of ourselves in the characters of the farmer and his wife.  How much we empathise, how deeply we feel, shall depend to a great extent on our own life experiences and opinions.  And herein lies Murnau's supreme skill.

Some argue that 'Sunrise' is the greatest silent film ever made.  Certainly it's high art, and its depth and scope tremendously ambitious.  Its subtitle 'A Song of Two Humans' is quite appropriate.  Watching 'Sunrise' is much like viewing poetry, and its themes and premises are timeless.

Another must see for anyone interested in cinema.",1092960000,2,1797,4.795454545454546
1262126,3,B00003CX6D,"A very beautiful and poetic film.  Murnau makes impressive use of several cinematographic techniques, particularly double exposure.  My favorite scenes include that in which the city is superimposed over the man and his mistress as she tries to convince him to go there with her.  In this scene, Murnau attains a frenzied, feverish energy by using rapid cuts, lots of moving figures and by simply moving the camera in a circular motion.  The scene comes together perfectly as the temptress suddenly stands up and begins gyrating her hips in unison with the images.  Very powerful effect.  Another great scene is when the man is struggling with the idea of killing his wife and the ghostly image of his mistress appears and begins kissing him, beautifully illustrating how he has fallen under her spell.",1091836800,2,802,4.992481203007519

When he wakes up he suggests that they should go on a little trip across the lake, but can he go through with his evil plans as he dwells on this moral predicament?

Sunrise is a beautiful film even if it has been worn by years of exposure to air that has degenerated the films quality.  The beauty is created by the director, Murnau, who displays a cinematic extravaganza as he tells his story of the pain and pleasures of human life.  The cinematography is brilliant and is still used today by many filmmakers.  Also, the special effects demonstrates creativity and inspired artistic skills as they are effortlessly interwoven into the story.  Lastly, the story itself is meticulously detailed as each scene brings depth and affection to the audience in esthetically pleasing manners, which in the end offers a brilliant cinematic experience.",1082073600,,1269,4.559471365638767
1262128,3,B00003CX6D,"I have a theory as to why the studio has kept this in such limited release to date:  the film just isn't that great!  Murnau's first American film has the dark ambiance of his last German one, Faust.  The narrative is well strung together: this is the sterotypical morality play in silent melodrama at its absolute peak; hence a probable reason for its high ranking by so many.  But Murnau's storytelling lacks the poignancy of a Rex Ingrahm, King Vidor, or even G.W. Pabst.  And it has none of the fun that Clara Bow or Mary Pickford brought to ""It"" or ""My Best Girl"".  Its just a drama, perhaps about family values, but I really don't feel that Murnau was as interested in any relevent message as he was in simply perfecting the artful but mechanical process of recording narrative though moving pictures.  Perhaps with great screen performaces (like a Valentino) this film could have been truly great.  But for me, the perfection of artful narration thru imagery is still not enough by itself to make a great film.  Fire away, but I rank Murnau's Tabu and Nosferatu well above this film.",1074902400,3,1090,4.635416666666667

A lack of passion; a faulty storyline; or the film was just simply too wierd!  But when I came across SUNRISE it was as if everything that I had ever seen in those earlier films, everything that was ever attempted from special effects to cinematography, even sound - it was as if it all clicked and I was perhaps watching the one truly perfect film.
  This was an American film made by an expressionist director, F.W.Murnau, a man who kept his vision in tact in spite of technological advances with sound and even color.  Even though ""talkies"" existed, Murnau instead opted to play with sound using it specifically when it was needed(a HORN BLOWING as a horse comes into frame, BELLS RINGING at a climactic moment when the plot abruptly shifts).  The subtitles in this ""silent"" film are only for effect.  Unlike films today, Murnau knew there was a better way to tell a story through soundtrack and photography and good acting, not a lot of subplot and pointless wording to give a character, well, character.  Maybe modern day filmmakers should take note, huh?
  But beyond whatever aesthetic purpose this film invokes, the raw emotion that comes on the screen between the two main characters is moving.  With the help of George O' Brien and Janet Gaynor, SUNRISE contains one of the single most complicated and sweeping scenes in film history when the husband gets on a trolley with his wife just after trying to kill her and within one shot, no action and no words spoken we see love at its best and its worst.
  SUNRISE is more than just a wonderful film, it has a history behind it.  It is the tip of the iceberg to an entire artistic movement that for some reason has remained to exist but in a ghostly presence among us.
  Read Film Architecture: Set Designs from Metropolis to Blade Runner.  It's a good book that provides a great deal of insight to SUNRISE as well as other great silent films.",1064880000,6,2233,4.696658097686376
1262130,5,B00003CX6D,"P>A farm couple takes the day off to spend time in the city.  The motivation that propels this trip produces archtypal emotions that shake them, and us, to the roots.  There is the sense that only by visiting the darkest places of the heart can one recognize the luminous treasure that already abounds.
Murnau's direction is astounding.  His masterly story telling is buoyed by effects that after 75 years are still innovative and most effective.  No doubt, this is one of the all time great films.
This Fox disc also offers a recreation of Murnau's subsequent (and now lost) FOUR DEVILS, by means of sketches, stills and script.  Naturally, the experience of being made aware of a film of reportedly spectacular vision that seems to be forever denied is a bit sad, but one must still appreciate the effort made to present the story as well as possible.",1062806400,,853,4.736486486486487
1262131,5,B00003CX6D,"Does this still happen in Cinema? When was the last time you were truly moved?
Every still in this film can be studied and appreciated on it's own merit. This is a key understanding on Murnau's perspective.
I saw this film for the first time on C4 (UK) summer 2002, and that was enough for me. Took a year before it was tracked down, and now I can watch it over and over again.
This truly has to be one of the greatest pieces of film history ever. Which in turn, led me on to the magnificence of German pre-war (2) cinema. Faust, Caligari, Nosferatu, don't even get me started on Fritz Lang ('M' - oops).
For further study check the books of 'Lotte Eisner'.

7917143,4,B00003CX6D,"The plot of Sunrise is good but familiar.  What makes this special is the way it was filmed.  Murnau expands the possibilities of what can be done with film. One gets the feeling that he is urging his fellow filmmakers to stretch beyond their comfort zone visually. His film was recognized as being visually groundbreaking, but the advent of ""talkies"" would, for a time, stunt the growth of this visual art.  Sadly, Murnau would only live long enough to make two more films, and one of them is lost.  This is an important film, but not for the plot.  It is, however, an enjoyable film.",1526342400,,585,4.533333333333333
