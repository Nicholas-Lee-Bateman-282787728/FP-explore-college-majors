3896701,5,B002BWP2BW,"I would never promote drug usage of any sort, but this show is media crack!  They lure in the audience with their superb storylines, witty banter, romantic teasing, and ""how-to tips."" The chemistry between the cast and the way they outsmart the bad guys...priceless. Throw in some interesting clients and wacky side-kicks and you're hooked.  I started watching the show during it's third season.  After viewing a couple of episodes during a marathon one day, I found myself out purchasing seasons 1 and 2 DVDs.  I fell in love.  In season 3, you will see how the characters have developed and genuinely love each through thick and thin.  Now, I'm going through withdrawals waiting for the remainder of season 3 to return in January 2010.  What can I say?  I'm addicted.  This IS must see T.V.",1254700800,48,792,4.764705882352941
3896702,5,B002BWP2BW,"Our family thinks ""Burn Notice"" is the best show on TV now with ""The Closer"" 2nd.  Great character development on both shows.  Note: To get the full flavor of both shows and the character development, we think you should start at Season One with both series. No matter how tempted you are to get to the ""meatier"" shows in the following seasons, take the time to watch season one's set-ups for both of them.  Don't get us wrong, they are *both* great first seasons, but the characters and plots get much more complex as the shows mature.  Trust us on ""Burn Notice"" however, the shows a winner, and should be up for multiple Emmy Awards.  This show has some of the best writing, casting, acting, directing and editing on TV.",1253404800,39,722,4.523076923076923

3896901,4,B002BWP2BW,"Have just completed watching Season 3 after a long layoff from the series.  It remains true to it's fundamental formula of sun, fun, and spies in Miami with ""burned"" spy Michael Weston and friends helping various clients all the while Michael works with various unsavory characters trying to get the burn notice revoked.  This is light entertainment as long as you can suspend belief on a number of levels.  My biggest problem is the cars are two primary heroes drive this season.  Michael continues to drive a classic 1973 Dodge Charger with a large hood scoop, not exactly the most inconspicuous ride even in Miami.  Worse yet for several episodes Sam Axe is driving a bright red, beautifully restored 1960 Buick LeSabre with white interior- yup, just the choice for covert ops.  Fun fact, in the girl group The Go-Go's drive an identical car in the video for their hit song ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" which came out in the early '80's.  Anyway, things end up with Michael missing and his future in doubt.  I'm concerned about Season 4 as the show runners mess with the nicely balanced cast chemistry adding a new team member named Jesse, I hate him already and haven't seen one episode yet...maybe he'll grow on me?",1432512000,,1213,4.7156398104265405

3896905,5,B002BWP2BW,"It's described as the hottest show of the summer in the TV ads, and I've got to say I have a hard time arguing with that.  What show?  Burn Notice, of course.  If you want action and adventure with lots of explosions, you've come to the right place, and season three continues to keep the burning going.

The show revolves around Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan).  Michael was a spy, and a very good one, until he got ""burned.""  Someone set him up with fake documents that made the US government not trust him any more.  They dumped him in Miami, his childhood home, which means he has to interact with mom Madeline (Sharon Gless).  Miami also happens to be the home of his on again off again girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), an arms dealer, and Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) a buddy who has retired from the FBI.  Michael supports himself by taking on jobs for people who are having problems the law can't deal with while also trying to clear his name from the burn list so he can go back to being a spy.

This season picks up exactly where season 2 ended.  Michael has just come face to face with the man who is responsible for having him burned.  In response to a job offer to work for him or deal with increasing pressure, Michael jumps from the helicopter where they are meeting and swims to shore.

Arriving back in Miami, he finds himself continuing to take the odd job to make money.  He helps capture a man stealing land in Venezuela.  He works hard to find a kidnapped boy.  He attempts to stop the leak of covert operative's names with only the word of a mentally disturbed man to go on.  He even takes on insurance scammers.

Unfortunately, he finds that this mysterious organization really has been protecting him.  Suddenly, he finds the police are asking way too many questions about all the explosions that seem to happen around him.  He's audited by the IRS.  And he makes contact with someone still working for the CIA who might help clear his name.  But all his efforts to clear his name cause friction in his relationships with Fi and Sam.  Will the three be able to continue working together?

This show works on two levels.  Each week features an A story that is resolved from start to finish in that episode.  But there is also the ongoing B story that continues from week to week about Michael's attempts to get his burn notice reversed.  As with last season, there are really two arcs to the B story, each lasting half the season and leaving you with a cliffhanger to get you to watch the next bit of the story.  Yes, some stuff from the B stories will get spoiled if you jump in here or watch a random episode, but you will have no problem following the A story.

I find both stories are worth tuning in to see every week.  I can never see how our heroes will get out of their predicaments alive, and yet they manage to at the last minute.  And they always manage to do it with lots of explosions and gun shots.  Really, this is the best action show on TV at the moment with lots of chases and gun play to keep any guy entertained.

Because of the conflict Michael, Fi, and Sam had over Michael's actions for most of the season, I felt the characters really grew.  And Michael's mom continues to develop, too.  I no longer see her as extraneous like I did in season 1 but very much a part of the show.  The character development did make the show felt more serious at times, but it was worth it for the rich characters.

Not that they don't include some humor in the mix like always.  Michael's voice over narration continue to provide some great lines as well as information on how to operate and build crazy gadgets (not that I'd try any of them myself).  And the wise cracks coming from the main characters continue as well.

Because of the added character development, the actors really had to step up this season, and they delivered.  Even the guest stars seemed to be up to the challenge.  This is a believably acted show on every level.

Season 3 consisted of 16 episodes, which are presented here in wide screen and full surround on four discs.  The final disc has a couple of extras, including the comic con panel for the show and a look behind the scenes at the stunts of the show.

If you haven't seen this show, you don't know what you are missing.  Whether you start with season three or go back to season 1, now is the best time to get into Burn Notice.",1430784000,,4391,4.3654320987654325

3896946,4,B002BWP2BW,"Had to get the entire series of Burn Notice since it was only being shown through Season 5 on Broadcast TV. In a way, the series was reminiscent of the old TV show ""Mission Impossible"" where clever impersonations allowed the ""take down"" of the ""bad guys"".

3897009,5,B002BWP2BW,"This show is amazing!!!!! I love everything about it!  I love Michael Weston, Fi, Sam & Michael's chain-smoking mother!  It has the detective good-guy/bad-guy cop-show aspect that I love, a great story line, characters with personality, the frustrated love-story between Michael & Fiona that keeps getting more interesting each season as as Michael realizes how much he really does love Fiona time and time again.  Characters from past episodes revisit to continue the story line.  The aspect of sweet revenge is rich in this series.  Michael and his team always come up with a perfect solution, and a perfect ending that satisfies.  When you feel like the episode is over, unlike most similar shows that leave you hanging and let you fill in the rest, there's always a bit more that gets resolved in a final longer-than-normal scene that makes you happy it's not over yet.

From a critical aspect, it is annoying that Michael never keeps one red cent from his clients, even when he's incurred a lot of expenses on their behalf and he has no money to begin with.  That part is over-the-top, and frankly, he should at least charge a small fee.  Fiona and Sam, as good as friends as they are, they can't dedicate their entire lives to Michael for free--it's pretty unrealistic.  Also a bit over-the-top are Fiona's scantily-clad outfits, as well as the plethora of bikini shots of passer-byes, etc.  This is unnecessary and does detract from the overall quality of the show.

However, this show has some great plot lines, funny lines, fantastic lines, and is just, incredibly entertaining.  I like shows such as Criminal Minds (which can have some themes that are too heavy, but you have to love the characters), Flashpoint (sorry they ended that one--love you Greg Parker), Blue Bloods (Tom Selleck, you still got it!!!!), Under the Dome (who would have guessed--yes, I'm addicted), and now...Burn Notice--LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  I'm going to burn through these seasons quickly at the rate I'm going, and then, I'm going to miss Michael Weston & his buddies.",1415836800,2,2051,4.924418604651163

There is a little blood spilled, cars blown up, but it is a fun, upbeat ride.  All of the main characters are a hoot and seem to enjoy acting together.

3897158,5,B002BWP2BW,"Season 3 of Burn Notice is my favorite. Michael is at his best and the interplay of Fiona and Sam are still a lot of fun. It's still on the lighter side. Later seasons get progressively more dark and tense. I like every season but Season 3 is where I go to get back to my Michael Weston ""happy place"".",1382227200,,301,4.033333333333333

The storyline is awesome, exciting, and engaging.  The acting is excellent.  Each episode leaves you wanting more.  I get that wanted to end it before the show ""jumped the shark"", but I would have liked a resolution to what happens after Michael and Fi are free of the CIA.  Seriously, do I really think after all that action that they are going to live in a cabin somewhere?  Don't they have to have money to live on?  Fiona never plans to blow anything up again?  No one finds out where they are?  A sequel is out of the question?",1379808000,,707,4.369230769230769

3897212,5,B002BWP2BW,"First off, I've completely fell in love with Jeffrey Donovan in Burn Notice-- he's fashionable and awesome.  His character of Michael Westen is downright awesome and amazing!  Hvae to throw out some love for Sam Axe and Fiona-- his team-- they keep it hot in Miami!  Mixed with butt-kicking, kindness, helping others, managing his family and girlfriend (we all know Fiona and him are together!), and still trying to figure out who burned him- he keeps getting another step closer- this is a series not to miss!  It's thilling, action and comedy all rolled into one.  It's a great series!

3897265,5,B002BWP2BW,"I absolutely love this series!!!!!!

The character development is superb. I have 4 seasons of this show and I have watched them more than 20 times. Even so, I still laugh in the same place because each time I watch, it's as if it's for the first time. The writers are to be commended on the consistency of the characters.  I love the fact that the top 4 characters, as well as the supporting characters, have well-developed personalities.

Jeffrey is the star, but his supporters are portrayed as real people, with real lives, who hold their own against his leadership.

Unlike Star Trek, The Original Series, the leading character in Burn Notice can really act. The supporting characters do not have to carry him.

This is my first review of a series and I know it sounds a bit incoherent, but I hope I have expressed myself well enough to indicate that I think this is a first rate show, with first rate writers and actors, and I hope this series will continue for many many years.

I know this would be a physical hardship for the actors and I would continue to be a purchaser of this series even if the actors are given more time off to recover sufficiently. Along with fewer episodes, I vote for lower prices!! I no longer pay more than $30.00 for any series; no matter how much I love them!!",1361577600,,1297,4.451476793248945

3897267,5,B002BWP2BW,"Have loved this since the very first time I saw Fiona light up my screen with her presence, throw in Michael Westin and well...fall down awesome.  The added plus of having Bruce Campbell in it, who is great by the way and kudos go out to him for finally getting Hollywood to seeing his potential and finally putting him in a leading role.  The action is incredbile, the story lines well thought out and original as the fact that Mikey drives a Charger and lucky for us, not the usual Ho-Hum Dukes of Hazzard one.  This has got to be one of the best cast cable shows on the tube, check it out.",1360713600,,592,4.221238938053097

If you have never seen burn notice I say start at season 1 episode 1 and you'll enjoy this hour of escape. While the episode have a stand alone plot, there is also an overall plot that carries from week to week. This overall plot deals with who, what, when and why, michael was kicked out Burnt hence Burn Notice) of the US spy biz. Fiona is hot and Sam is the best supporting actor of any TV show going now. From episode 1 of season 1, the chemistry is amazing. The plots are fun and the premise is unique. The actors just fit the show like a glove. Take in the first 6 episodes and you'll be hooked. Unless your one of those brainless reality show drones. Keep it up USA and Burn Notice. I want atleast 10 season!!!",1319155200,,1093,4.23444976076555

If you do know the show, then nothing I can add will mean much. It's terrific, period, and OF COURSE you need to get all seasons for your collection.

Some other reviews have faulted this set of DVDs for the relative lack of extra materials. That's true, but no reason not to get the set. I'd add that I'm also annoyed by the lack of any kind of printed episode index on the cover or insert. It wouldn't kill them to have prepared and included title and synopsis of each episode. As it is, you can end up wasting time swapping disks in and out hunting for particular shows.

Many of the episodes seemed done in a herky jerky manner, as if the writers knew what they wanted, but hadn't quite gotten it all finished before the episode began shooting. Still, I would have given this dvd set 4 stars except there is nothing to it except the episodes. Yes there is a stuntman section and the ComiCon bit, but as dvd extras, seriously lacking. I expect some commentaries and some extras from writers and directors talking about the season and what they did and thought. As is, the only reason I purchased this was to keep my set complete, and hope the Fourth Season dvd set is better.",1296345600,,714,4.5
3897523,4,B002BWP2BW,"Burn Notice season 3 is really a story of two seasons. The first half is not nearly as interesting as the second. The first half struggled to find a good back bone story for the overall mythology of the show. With Management no longer watching his back Michael is left to deal with his enemies alone. It sounds like a great premise, but was not executed well. First there is a cop that wants to put Michael down, a Middle eastern spy who wants revenge, amongst others. They never had any excitement to them and just felt too serialized. The enemies just never seemed to actually be a match for Michael Weston. The show already has it serialized part covered with the cases of the week. It didn't need any more predictable story lines. There was one standout in the first eight though, and that was when Brennan returns to exact revenge on Michael. That episode was very unpredictable and kept me on the edge of my seat.

As the show reached it's hiatus a great overall arc began to take shape through the introduction of Gilroy. He is a Black Ops sociopath that uses Michael to do his dirty work or he'll kill everyone he knows. He played very similar to Carla from season two, but was far more threatening. This arc lasted for the second half of the season as week after week Michael unraveled another piece to his plan. In it's conclusion the plan is nothing that I saw coming. The finale leaves you wanting more and ends with a great mirror image of Michael. As you ask yourself what he could become.

The acting as always is top notch and the voice overs by Jeffery Donovan are always enjoyable and the best part of the show in my opinion. Along with Brennen other characters resurface such as Sugar (drug dealer Michael shot in the pilot), Larry, and Nate all lead to some great episodes. The video quality is much improved over previous seasons that have been released. The grain though still evident is kept at a somewhat lower saturation level throughout the season. The bonus features are scarce and I miss the days of the scene specific commentary from season one. The only interesting special feature is a seven minute look at the Burn Notice panel at Comic Con.

Overall this season would be a great addition to your Burn Notice library. Just bare with the sometimes boring first half of the season because the second half is riveting and everything you want from this top notch show.",1296086400,,2396,4.541666666666667

Disks one and four each have around 6 commercials at the front (they neglected to mention this in the description of the contents). Menus are disabled in this section forcing you to skip each commercial individually. One reason I buy TV programs on disk rather than watch them on TV is to avoid commercials.

Bruce Campbell provides the comic relief against the hot & sexy background of Miami.  These are all grade A actors with unbelievable writing draped across the beautiful and vibrant Miami beaches.  Add to this the tounge and cheek essence of the show, the needed information (I always wanted to be a spy) and the tense sexuality and action you just can't go wrong.  This show is unusual in that it never had the growing pains of other shows so there are no ""less than"" seasons.

3897663,5,B002BWP2BW,"I never saw Burn Notice on TV, but kept hearing good things about it. So, picked up Season 1 to see what it was like, and quickly became hooked. Glad to see that the momentum and quality of the show has been kept strong through season 3. If you're already a fan and have seen Season 1 and 2, this is well worth getting even if it lacks extras. If you're not yet a fan, then look for a deal where you can get all three seasons at once, since once you see a few episodes, you're probably going to want more!

The show itself is not a deep, character-driven drama but rather a fun, entertaining exploration of the spy world, with enough character development to hook you in. You won't walk away with any new meaning or perspective on life, but escapist entertainment is just the ticket sometimes.  Decent dialog, good acting, things blowing up, and lots of beach shots. Well worth the price of admission!

I'm particularly impressed with the lead (Jeffrey Donovan). I was unfamiliar with him prior to seeing Burn Notice, but will keep an eye out for his other work. Excellent performance.",1281398400,,1085,4.49746192893401

3897665,5,B002BWP2BW,"Burn Notice manages to blend spy thrillers and cinematic action with down-to-earth realism. Michael Westen isn't James Bond or Jason Bourne -- as he says in the very first episode, ""Guns make you stupid. Better to fight your wars with duct tape. Duct tape makes you smart,"" just before he gets past an armored door using a stud finder and a roll of duct tape. Like a cool MacGuyver without the bad hair, Michael wins by out-thinking and out-planning his foes, not just by beating them up and shooting them (though there's plenty of that, too). And his running internal narration fills the audience in on WHY he's doing what he's doing. Yes, you too can turn a cell phone into an audio bug, and here's how!

The cast fits together like a glove and with amazing chemistry. His ex-girlfriend (and former IRA terrorist) Fionna adds impulsiveness and anger to the group, while his ex-military friend Sam (played by the amazing Bruce Campbell) alternates between the voice of reason and a hook for some skirt-chasing humor. The interplay and developing relationship between Michael and his mom (who swings between helping the crew -- sometimes even saving the day -- and being a serious thorn in Michael's side) is realistic and fun to watch. The relationships between all of the characters (but especially the one between Michael and his mom) grow and develop as the series goes on, which is one of the best reasons for watching it.

On each episode, someone comes to the team for help with a problem no one else can take care of (A-Team style). While the group is dealing with that, the overall ""season plot"" gets advanced a bit. In Season One, Michael is just trying to figure out who burned him and why. In Season Two, Michael is trying to get out from under their thumb. In Season Three, Michael has lost his protection and has deal with ""real life"" in the form of prying cops and old enemies. In Season Four, Michael has a broader view of what's going on, and is trying to stop a dangerous conspiracy. The ""story arc"" for each season is always advanced -- sometimes a little, sometimes a lot -- so you never feel like a show was just a throwaway they tossed together.

If you're not into Burn Notice, check it out, Thursdays at 9 on USA. If you are a fan, then what are you waiting for? Get this DVD set! The show is amazing!",1279152000,,2325,4.544152744630072
3897666,4,B002BWP2BW,"After the set up of Series One and plot development of Series Two, Burn Notice handles the traditionally difficult third series with skill and aplomb mainly due to the skilled acting of the three leads, who manage to deliver their comic lines with skill, but at the same time bring some real depth and sense of danger to their characters. The writers have also developed the plot lines beyond the ""lets stop the drug dealer doing bad things"" and added some unexpected twists as well as some genuinely interesting supporting characters. Burn Notice remains a genuine and worthwhile addition to the light hearted spy romp genre.",1278979200,,626,4.915094339622642

I got turned on to this at Netflix and was blown away. This is the best TV show I have seen for a long, long time. Mix Miami Vice, Macguyver, the Bourne movies and add a touch of noir detective voice over, and you get the idea. The blend is fresh, exciting, enjoyable to watch, well written, shot, and acted. There is a great blend of drama, action, and comedy, and the writers manage to throw in plot twists and multiple story arcs which keep one guessing, yet do not feel contrived.

The characters seem real and believable. The mix and chemistry are great, and the development of characters and long term arcs is very well handled at all levels. Good job to everyone involved in this. In this day and age, it is not easy to create and maintain a good show like this.

Highly recommended. I am going to buy seasons 1 and 2.

I'm not going to talk about the episode quality in detail here, it's the same fun show it always was.  But this DVD set is completely bare bones when compared to seasons 1 and 2.  There are no audio commentaries, no gag reel, no deleted scenes, pretty much no extras to speak of except for two short, simple featurettes involving the stunts of the show and some fun with Bruce Campbell at Comic-Con.  These extras were alright...but that's all you get.

Regardless, season 3 is definitely worth owning, but unless you're a die hard fan that needs to have these episodes on display right now, consider waiting for the price point to drop.  You're pretty much getting JUST episodes with these DVDs, and it would be a much cheaper route to just purchase the episodes in a digital format instead of shelling out close to 50 bucks retail.

3897810,4,B002BWP2BW,"Matt Nix, Jeffrey Donovan and Bruce Campbell continue to keep my interest going in the Michael Westen and Sam Axe story.  The relationship between Fiona and Michael continues to ""develop"" in its own offbeat way, as does Michael's relationship with his mother, who persists in her belief that her son doesn't do anything horrible and never did.

Tim Matheson makes a welcome return as Michael's older, murderous ex-partner.  Paul Blackthorne of ""The Dresden Files"" also pops up as an Irish terrorist hellbent on hunting Fiona.  In addition, you'll see Jonathan LaPaglia from the ""Seven Days"" TV series not to mention Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeida from ""24"") and Chris Vance (Whistler from the later ""Prison Break"" seasons).  And let's not forget Garrett Dillahunt (""Deadwood,"" ""Life"" and ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles""), John Mahoney (""Say Anything,"" ""Frasier"") and Jay Karnes (""The Shield,"" ""Sons of Anarchy"").  All-star cast, all the way.

One big letdown is the lack of a bloopers reel on this DVD.  Other extras are few and far between this season.

3897812,4,B002BWP2BW,"Burn Notice Season 3
16 Episodes on 4 Discs being released June 15, 2010

""Burn Notice"" is a series about a spy who was ""burned"" and had to settle in a city without any records of a past and make due with his surroundings. Luckily for Michael Westen, he ended up in beautiful Miami with all the mojitos you can drink and the great Bruce Campbell in his company. What's so hard about that?

It turns out quite a bit. Jumping into the third season without seeing the previous two appears to be not to challenging a feat as the premise is simple and the episodes engaging. Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) has a relationship with a ""trigger-happy"" ex-girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar) and someone who used to be an FBI informant, Sam Axe played by Bruce Campbell to help him out on jobs that he and the other two plan together to make some money or help out someone in need. This season begins after Michael cuts all ties with his former employers who in theory had been protecting him and now the gloves are off and he is on his own.

Spy training comes in handy in lots of situations and one really enjoyable element of the series is the use of Michael voiceovers to give instruction on useful tricks and techniques in the spy business for whatever he is doing at the moment. It feels almost like a how-to course and when you see him make a complex device out of everyday items to catch the signal of a cell phone, you'll be hooked and wonder if you could make one yourself if given the chance.

Of course, what spy show wouldn't be complete with undercover missions, picking up accents, and lots of explosions? These are plentiful and at the end of the day, the three get to go to the bar together or home to Michael's mother, Madeline (Sharon Gless) and her badly-made birthday cake. Sam stays at Michael's mother's place and is in the process of hefty renovations in season three due to a sun room he blew up presumably at the end of season two.

In this season, Michael has attracted the attention of a suspicious Detective trying to entrap him in any way possible. Luckily for him, he always seems to be one or two steps ahead and even attempts to solve one of her cases to get her to back off. Michael also wonders if getting back into his old line of work would be more secure than his current lifestyle and takes steps to open that door back up even though Fiona and Sam disagree with him. Some villains jump into play to attempt to use Michael's skills and promptly dispose of him. The ending of this season leaves Michael in a great cliffhanger.

Fiona is a hard-as-nails lady who doesn't leave herself vulnerable to her emotions and prefers to take the direct approach in life and in her work. She is coined as ""trigger-happy"" which is an accurate assessment of her instinctual behavior. She considers romance with Michael to be what Michael's mother calls ""trench warfare"" so she is always on guard. Sam Axe enjoys courting old ladies with large bank rolls as it affords him the opportunity to drive many fantastic looking cars and he also serves as back-up and reconnaissance on many missions. Michael's mother is somewhat scatterbrained and a terrible cook, but is fiercely loyal to her son and his friends.

This is a very enjoyable action series on the beach with lots of explosions, car chases, undercover character work, and mojitos.

Bonus Features:

There is a featurette on the ""Burn Notice"" Stunt Unit that lasts almost ten minutes and details how a car chase scene goes down complete with voiceovers from Michael Weston's character and clips from the show to tie it together. Also it has the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International panel for Burn Notice featuring Bruce Campbell, Ben Shenkman, Matt Nix, Alfredo Barrios Jr, Jake Karnes, and Seth Peterson. There are about 10 minutes of answering questions from the audience and Campbell being treated like the rock star he is.",1277078400,,3901,4.609510086455331
3897813,2,B002BWP2BW,"I adore Burn Notice and I was so thrilled to buy these DVDs. I saw the two special features listed but I figured that was IN ADDITION to the standard episode commentary, deleted scenes, and outtakes. Boy was I wrong! Don't be fooled. I loved season 3, it has some of my favorite episodes, but this product...the DVD set put out by Fox...is a huge disappointment. I have all of these episodes on my tivo or I could download my favorites from Amazon on demand or iTunes. The ComicCon panel can be found on YouTube. Save yourself the money and just burn your own dvds...they'd probably be the same quality.

It's such a shame because this show has great writers and actors who can speak both eloquently and hilariously about their work. When I asked USA execs about these DVDs I was told that the DVDs and all merchandising goes through FOX. When we asked FOX about the DVDs we were told that Matt Nix was in charge of what would be on the DVDs and they didn't want to pressure him while he was working with his new show. I really don't know who is responsible here, but all parties involved need to get their act together before they completely alienate their fanbase.

If you really want these DVDs, try to find them somewhere with the deepest discount you can get because they're certainly not worth the list price. Again, I love the show, but these DVDs are just embarrassing.",1276992000,3,1377,4.48207171314741
3897814,4,B002BWP2BW,"I'm not going to review the show here, I think it is great and don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said here in a bunch of other reviews.  What I want to talk about is the DVD set.

The set comes in a solid-feeling standard-size 4-disc case, not one of those flimsy cardboard cases with multiple flips or individual sleeves.  I don't know about anyone else, but the terrible packaging a lot of DVD sets get irks me.  The 1st season of Burn Notice came in one of these lousy packages, but 2 & 3 are very nice.

The last disk in the set has a couple extra features, most notably a featurette on the driving stunts in the season's final episode.  It's pretty good, but doesn't overcome the complete lack of commentaries or outtakes (the minimum required extras, in my opinion).

Overall, you get the show in better-than-average packaging, just don't expect much in the way of extra content.",1276560000,3,903,4.5030674846625764

3897817,2,B002BWP2BW,"As with the first two seasons, Burn Notice season 3 delivers great (if repetitive at times) stories, terrific narration and writing, good action, nice REAL explosions, and wonderful characters. Perhaps it's because they do so few episodes each season that things don't get stale, but it works.

However, as excellent as the show and the individual episodes are, the DVD set itself is below par. There are no commentaries on ANY of the 16 episodes, the special features are a focus on the stunt crew and a panel from the SD Comic Con 2009 that did not even have Jeffrey Donovan or Gabrielle Anwar; while the performance of Bruce Campbell, who is the reason I started watching the show in the first place, is hilarious, the jumpy editing and short total run of the clip makes the viewer feel disappointed.

Had there been even one commentary with some of the stars, or a run of outtakes from various episodes, I would have bumped the review up a couple stars. But this is not just a review of the show, it's of the packaging. Basically, the DVD set gives you nothing worth seeing that you couldn't get from watching the show on USA. That's a disappointment.",1276041600,8,1155,4.6292682926829265
3897818,3,B002BWP2BW,"Lack of any commentaries, gag reel, outtakes, deleted scenes makes this DVD set a real disappointment.  Matt Nix, we can assume this was your decision....you addressed this on your tweet as a message to those who wanted this, saying it would be tough to get everyone together and how tough it is to find the time or some such garbage.  Not a good decision, Matt.  Has the show become so popular that you don't think you have to give the extra effort anymore?  Check out the message boards on the show's page on USA Network to see that your fans are not happy with this.  Never a good idea to take your fan base for granted.

Updating this review in late August....I had a hunch Matt Nix's focus was too divided what with starting the new series, ""The Good Guys.""  Maybe that was the reason he didn't take the time and effort to add the expected extras to the BN 3rd Season DVD set.  Even so, I dutifully, set the DVR to record the new series, expecting it to match the caliber of BN.  Gave it a shot but couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.  Not a winner and, sure enough, it's been pulled.

Message to Matt:  You're probably not a ""one-hit wonder,"" but, seriously?  You've hit the target on Burn Notice.  But try to stay humble.  I'm of the opinion that your creation, its concept and writing, are all first rate....BUT....without the cast you have in place, it may not have been such a hit.  As good as BN has been, it's the synergy (hate that word) of all the elments in BN that have made it a winner, including the ones you don't have to renew contracts with....the gorgeous city of Miami and God's glorious ocean.  Those components were completely absent in Good Guys.  Before you absorb all the accolades and begin to believe all the press proclamations of your genius, stay focused on keeping BN the top show it is and don't let yourself get too scattered.  Your first foray away from your ""home"" wasn't great.  Slow down, regroup and keep your eyes on the prize.  And always remember it's the fans that will make or break you.  Be nice to us.  And by now, after all the disappointment over the Season 3 DVD set, you know precisely what that means.",1275696000,21,2157,4.405063291139241
3897819,5,B002BWP2BW,"Season three of BURN NOTICE does much to forward the story of ex-spy Michael Westen's attempt to rejoin the spy world while at the same time rounding out the story of Michael Westen the human being. While that may not sound like much in a weekly action series that takes some doing. To do so with the perfect combination of action, humor and story is even tougher. But the people behind this series make it seem easy.

If you recall from the origin of the series, Westen was a super spy who was put on burn notice. A burn notice is when a spy gets left out in the cold or as he puts it in the voice over at the start of each episode ""...when you're burned you've got nothing; no cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they've decided to dump you in. You do whatever work comes your way."" Fortunately for Westen he was left stuck in Miami.

And in Miami Westen was fortunate to have contacts like an ex-flame Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) who has an explosive temper to match her skills with weapons and bombs, a friend from his past and ex-Navy SEAL Sam (Bruce Campbell) who keeps him in touch with information and his mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who, well, does all the things a worried mother would do. I mean what would have happened had they stuck him in a small Midwestern town?

Westen, played superbly by Jeffrey Donovan, has shown in two previous seasons that while killing was his living while going up against bad men around the world, he truly has a heart of gold. Each episode formed around two core stories, the first being about Michael attempting to find out who burned him and the second being a case where he had ""clients"" that he had to help with one problem or another. Season two put him in touch with a lead that could have led him to the person behind the burn. But that season ended with her being shot and ""management"" telling him they would stop protecting him.

Thus we start season three with Michael still stuck in Miami with the same crew. The only difference is that now the agency that prevented people from finding out he was alive and where he was located, have stopped all protection. This results in bad guys around the world coming in search of Michael while he continues trying to find a way back in as well as help a new client each episode.

A lead takes Michael into meeting with an agent of sorts who takes on former spies and uses them as mercenaries for various tasks. Once again Michael has the chance to find out who burned him and to get back in. But as we've seen all along, former love Fiona would be happier if he put his past in the past and focused on their future. But Michael is driven by a need to help, a need to serve his country and a need to find out who did this to him not just to get back in the game but to make sure the people he cares about are safe as well.

What makes this series work is the same thing that a number of series have begun to take seriously: the cast. When you have a cast that gels well together and that you can believe, it makes the difference. Think back to a series with a cast of 4 or more people that didn't work and you'll see what I mean. When it works the viewer cares about the characters and is willing to invest time to be with them each week. And while they shoot people and blow things up, these are characters you begin to care for.

Each actor does a job that unfortunately has gone unrecognized by awards programs thus far. Anwar is great as the sexy love interest whose emotions are much more revealed than her character would be in any other show. Gless does a great job as a worrying mother trying to make up for the past. Campbell takes his iron jawed, womanizing, best bud character and makes him the kind of guy you'd want to have a drink with. And Donovan as Westen is amazing.

Each week Westen is called on to turn himself into another cover, another person, to do the job he needs to do. Donovan in short plays not just Westen but Westen playing other people, be it mentally challenged individuals, terrified accountants, tough talking deal makers or cold blooded murderer. He does so with ease while making Westen's character seem like the most competent spy that ever existed.

Season three brings Michael closer to finding out who had him burned. It provides several stories that show the depth of character and truly caring person he really is. It offers plenty of action for fans. And it shows that Michael has more familial feelings than even he would care to admit. Season three has it all. The only thing missing that can fault this DVD offering is that season four isn't there and ready to go as well. It will start soon though and you have the choice of catching up and becoming a fan by renting/buying all three previous seasons before it begins or just jumping onboard now. No matter what, this is one series that deserves to be watched.

One bonus for TV fans in season three: the reunion of actresses Gless and Tyne Daly, the former stars of CAGNEY AND LACEY, together again in one episode. If you were a fan, you'll love seeing them together again.",1275350400,25,5094,4.35827186512118

The dialogue is schmaltzy, the villain is so over the top as to be ludicrous, the formerly clear demarcation line between good and evil is blurred - the series is playing like a soap opera.
