5562423,4,B00B81NPPM,"""Stevie Nicks ~ Through The Looking Glass"" is a surprisingly well done documentary on the career of Stevie Nicks. It covers the years 1966 until 2013. Along the way a ton of vintage video clips, interviews and performances, and photos are shown. New interviews are done with producer Keith Olsen, Rick Vito, Ken Caillet and a few others. Stevie herself is shown in archive interview footage. For the most part this is a good overview of her career, if you're a long time fan you won't learn anything new really, but it's a worth a look. It's two hours long, but the first hour alone covers the albums ""Buckingham Nicks"" thru ""Tusk"" (1973-1979). The next 55mins cover ""Bella Donna"" thru ""Street Angel"" (1981-1994) and the last five minutes brings us up to day very quickly. It's done better than expected and the vintage footage (most of which is probably out on YouTube) is a plus.",1365724800,55,881,4.690322580645161
5562424,5,B00B81NPPM,"This film is a compelling masterpiece of intimate personal introspection and cocaine. I was moved to tears by the touching eye witness accounts of Stevie kidnapping children on tour, in order to exchange them for cocaine and fine lace.

A powerful come back story of how a person can re-emerge from the darkness of despair and depravity with the help of money and reunion tours. There is a scene that shows her living humbly and quietly atop a lighthouse in Maine, eating cat food and playing Wii bowling with Mick Fleetwood. This film is a roller coaster of deception, chaos, and melodrama. The section covering the years that she was on ""Different Strokes"" was pretty hard to stomach. Stevie Nicks is a scrappy survivor with a never say die (and never say no) attitude toward life, love, and cocaine.",1365638400,4,802,4.76978417266187

5562438,5,B00B81NPPM,I've loved this Stevie Nicks DVD since getting it a couple of years ago. The film is a documentary that covers Stevie's whole career both with and without Fleetwood Mac. It is particularity good on her post Rumours solo career but parallels this nicely with her band work - covers a fair bit about Stevie's personal life too and has some really goo interviews with the lady herself in which she is completely honest and reveals a lot.,1454112000,,434,4.576923076923077

5562460,4,B00B81NPPM,"As a longtime fan of Stevie Nicks, I found Through The Looking Glass to be an entertaining and predominantly satisfying film. The archival footage, much of which Id never seen or at least hadnt seen in ages and did not previously have immediate access to via a DVD such as this, includes some real gems in the form of interviews, live performances, and behind-the-scenes video clips. Likewise, much of the music utilized is from live performances, showcasing some amazing moments from Nicks storied career. I note all of this, as I stated above, as a fan. For me, Stevie Nicks is basically untouchable, a paradigm of classic rock perfection whose work Ive treasured for over thirty years now. And I am compelled to note my personal feelings for the artistry of Stevie Nicks to clarify my overall satisfaction with this film despite its flaws, which must be addressed in any fair assessment of the finished work. Inexplicably, the filmmakers utilized a format that attempted to recap Nicks thirty-plus year career with a narrative delivered in present tense, i.e. Nicks and Buckingham join the band at this point and then and so forth. The mixed-bag of experts chosen to present the story created an even bigger challenge for me. Not only did they fall into the trap of attempting to use present tense  failing often, with rambling sentences that veered through as many as five tenses in the course of one brief tale  but their actual expertise and ability to provide insightful information ranged from adequate at best (Uncut magazines Nigel Williamson and record producer Ken Caillat) to so far removed from adequate that it was actually offensive to hear them speak (the overly smug yet clearly out of her element Ann Powers, whose misguided attempts to classify both Nicks as a person and the meaning behind her songs with a misapplied coat of mid-90s Lilith Fair style feminism that is, in itself, out of date and out of touch, was painful to endure and utterly pointless), with strangely chosen segments from contributors who certainly do know that of which they speak but who offered little of substance here (the dean of American rock critics Robert Christgau, who clearly detests both Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac, making his inclusion in the project puzzling; the overly conceited record producer Keith Olsen, who similarly marred the otherwise brilliant documentary on famed studio Sound City, where both the Buckingham-Nicks album and the Fleetwood Mac classic Rumors were recorded). Additionally, the majority of this 2-hour documentary focused more on Fleetwood Mac as a whole than on Stevie Nicks as a person or as a performer; only the final 30 minutes (at best) was devoted to Nicks solo career, with the past decade or so covered in a blurry 90-second haze and the entirety of it essentially slagged off as unnecessary by the less-than-astute talking heads employed to provide commentary. Again, as a fan of Stevie Nicks  to the level of being someone who really would have to make an effort NOT to enjoy pretty much anything she does  I did enjoy Through The Looking Glass, and I recommend it to anyone who shares my level of enjoyment of Nicks music, if only for the treasure trove of archival video and audio collected therein.",1384646400,,3249,4.923357664233577
5562461,5,B00B81NPPM,"A teacher whose lessons are through her words and lyric content. Home town resident who made it to the top, yet showed that everyone has their own struggles and can make it through them.",1384473600,2,186,4.5
5562462,4,B00B81NPPM,"I'm a huge fan of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac so I was excited to watch this. I loved the old footage of her performances of some of Fleetwood Mac's and her own hits, as well as interviews with her and bandmates/producers I had never seen before. I learned some things about her and the band that I didn't know, such as how her and Lindsey met in high school and about inner tensions at the time of the recording of Rumours and when Lindsey left the band after Tango in the Night was released. I felt it was a very comprehensive look at her early career with Fleetwood Mac and the beginning of her solo career in the 80s, BUT...

I'm giving it 4 stars because the documentary really breezes through the 90s and up to now in about 5 minutes! I wanted to hear more about the band's reunions, especially the planning of their iconic The Dance tour in 1997 and more about her personal life from that time period. It also didn't really discuss her drug problems and glossed over it. I also didn't like that all the Stevie interviews were from the 70s, 80s, and mid 90s for the most part, so there was no new interviews with her, which greatly disappointed me. All in all, I enjoyed the DVD very much but it leaves something to be desired. If you're a big fan of hers like me, you'll enjoy it regardless of its shortcomings.",1384300800,,1321,4.305220883534137

5562469,4,B00B81NPPM,The video follows Stevie Nicks from her early years in the music business through the present time.  Most of the emphasis is on her time spent with Fleetwood Mac especially the recording of the Rumours album.  Some very nice film footage from throughout her career is included.  Very little music although snippets of her musical work is played.  Some wonderful commentaries during this show that give insight into motivating factors that influenced Stevie's art.

I am a big fan of Steve and Fleetwood Mac, and have read many books and articles about her as both a solo artist and as a member of Fleetwood Mac.  I found this documentary to be very informative in that the people who were interviewed had definite links to Stevie and knew her well.  Their interviews gave new insights into Stevie and Fleetwood Mac and were not just a rehash of articles or interviews that had been given previously.  There were great pictures that I had not seen before, and some great music as well.  All in all, a very enjoyable view of Stevie Nicks.",1369008000,5,722,4.350746268656716

I was disappointed in this DVD.  The commentators were boringly flat to dreadful music critics (except for Ken Callait, who seemed authentic and caring).  The commentary from Robert Christgau seems an odd addition, as he explicitly states his antipathy towards Stevie.  Anyway, I liked the performance footage and also hearing Stevie in her own voice (clips from previously published material).  Seems like not much new here.

It was nice to have Rick Vito there as someone whos actually created and performed along side Stevie. Nice selection of photos and concert clips made the 2 hours fly by. Definitely for those who are collector's already, but for newbies I would suggest the book ""Read Between my Lines"" or watch VH1 Behind the Music as they are much more in depth.

The roommate of my friend had a father working for the label. Anyway, this documentary sadly needs more band footage and at least one member of Fleetwood Mac chiming in on..... anything?!! Any footage with Stevie talking has been seen before. Boring stuff. I felt like I needed to get out pen and paper so I will be totally prepared for the follow up quiz!! It is mostly commentaries and opinions of the whole experience.
  Understand that I am a huge fan of FM from the beginning(Peter Green) through the mid-eighties, so I am by no means a hater. I also like Stevie Nicks' solo stuff... I think her latest might contain her most consistent songwriting. Overall, I just don't think the documentary was very good.

I JUST WISH IT WAS MORE OF STEVIE DOING THE TALKING INSTEAD OF A MUSIC JOURNALIST OR THE RECORDING STUDIO GUY OR SOME GUY THAT I FELT DIDN'T LIKE STEVIE THAT MUCH, DO WISH IT WAS LONGER TO INCLUDE, HER WORK VISITING THE WOUNDED IN THE MILITARY HOSPITAL , THE WORK SHE DID ON HER CURRENT CD ' IN YOUR DREAMS', MORE OF STEVIE TELLING HER LIFE STORY.",1366156800,6,699,4.065217391304348

I learned that Lindsey decided to be the de facto musical director for Fleetwood Mac.

I learned that Lindsey was TOTALLY into punk rock.

Oh, and Stevie did coke, and later, switched to painkillers.

While Companion & I watched the whole thing with considerable interest, we were left frustrated by the false advertising - this documentary spends a ton of time on the making of ""Rumours"" and ""Tusk"", then speeds through all the rest of Stevie's career.

If you want to see a really interesting and insightful documentary about ""Rumours"", pick up the Classic Albums dvd, which includes a ton of fascinating interviews with the band (some of which are scissored into this documentary.)

We hope that Stevie's working on a big ol' tell-all memoir, because she's a woman with a great story that we're dying to hear. And we'll continue to hope that someone, sometime, may eventually make a really good documentary about her.

8563845,5,B00B81NPPM,"A very likable documentary about Stevie Nicks. Many rock documentaries seem to be filled with sycophants having endless praise about the featured artist. This documentary has some of that, but also buffered with critical commentary about Stevie's life and times.

The documentary starts from her early days pre-Fleetwood, and spends most of the time in her glory years, then a quicker summary at the end of her current period...which is less popular. It becomes evident in the documentary that her success is solely due to her drive as a strong song and music maker. She obviously is strong willed, and that comes out too. I'm kind of amazed she was able to do so well with all the cocaine, alcohol, and barbituates she went thru. But those are rock and roll times.

An odd thing I noticed. In the first half there is are some scenes with Christine McVie, and Christine hardly physically opens her mouth when she talks. Kinda weird, almost like a ventriloquist.

This really was an well produced documentary. They didn't leave stuff out. It is obvious that Stevie was (or maybe still is) a prima donna. Maybe that happens to a lot of rock and rollers. I don't think it happened to Tom Petty, whom she used to sing with. Anyhow, the fast forward button didn't get touched until near the end. The documentary is that engrossing. I hope you enjoy it as well.",1512864000,4,1355,4.684873949579832
