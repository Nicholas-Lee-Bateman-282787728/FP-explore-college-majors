2871991,4,B000ROAMEI,I am always on the lookout for Shakespeare movies - modern takes on it to share with students showing them the connection - everything old can be new.,1247529600,,150,4.392857142857143
2871992,5,B000ROAMEI,"This is a wonderful, sentimental, love story. Happened to catch part of it on TV and had to get a copy for myself. I saw the original with Mel Gibson a few years before but this version with Thomas McCarthy is so much better. McCarthy plays a slightly mentally challenged man who falls in love with a older woman played by Candice Bergen. He must battle his parents, his sister and even Bergen but he persists and wins everyone over in the end.",1247270400,9,444,4.36144578313253
2871993,5,B000ROAMEI,"I loved this movie when it showed on the Hallmark Channel, and was never able to catch it again.  So thrilled to find it on Amazon.

You'd think it would be a little creepy, given the subject matter of an older woman and a young man...but it was handled very tastefully.  I thought Candice Bergen did a wonderful job in the role of Mary.  She played it with much compassion.

Will watch it over and over...",1244764800,2,406,4.2894736842105265
2871994,4,B000ROAMEI,"I watch relatively few TV movies, but of those I have seen, Mary and Tim stands out.  The plot, which concerns a lonely widow, Mary, and a ""slow"" younger man, Tim, is straightforward and moves ahead through familiar, almost soap-opera devices.  There is a snoopy neighbor who represents convention; she means well, but is usually wrong in her advice.  The parents of Tim's sister's fiance are snobs, so Mary has to take him to her beach house to protect them from the embarrassment of having him at the reception with their ""business associates""; this gives her a chance to relax with him.  And so it goes.  All of the main characters are good people, almost too good.

Although this sounds pretty dreadful, what sets the film apart is its unexpected message, among all the cliches, that people have to decide for themselves what matters to them and then have the courage to live by those decisions.  The central relationship is not conventional at all, and in a world where the flowers are abundant, the grass is always green, there is always just enough wind at the beach to move the flags prettily, and no-one seems to notice how beautiful Candice Bergen is, this is absolutely wonderful.  Bergen's character is intelligent, tender and wry, and Bergen portrays her well.  Thomas McCarthy does an exceptional job of creating a slow person with great heart, charm, innocence and emotional perception.  The end result is very touching.",1244332800,12,1435,4.868312757201646
2871995,4,B000ROAMEI,"I remember the first time I saw ""Mary and Tim"" on TV and loved it. It's even better the second time around. Reminds us all that love comes in all types of packages. And Ronnie and Julie is barely ok - Joshua Jackson's acting is pretty awful here . . .not to mention the fake snow and snow 'carpet' (I kid you not).",1243814400,,314,4.0
2871996,3,B000ROAMEI,i really liked this movie...but...this is not an academy award winning movie...it isn't socially relevent either...  it's a sappy romance love story...a distraction from all the bad news of reality...  i also happen to like candy bergen too...,1234396800,,243,5.368421052631579
2871997,5,B000ROAMEI,"I surfed to this on cable TV the other evening, caught it right at the beginning, and got hooked. It sucked me in and I had no idea what was going to happen, as I hadn't read about it beforehand.  This is a terrifically touching and sexy, real story with an awesome ending!",1228435200,3,273,4.150943396226415
2871998,5,B000ROAMEI,"Really enjoyed the movies, esp. Mary and Tim.  Received DVD in time expected and in good condition.  Women will probably enjoy the DVD more than men.",1223510400,,149,4.6923076923076925
2871999,4,B000ROAMEI,i never thought i would find ronnie and julie on dvd so this is amazing for me,1215993600,,78,3.6470588235294117
2872000,5,B000ROAMEI,"Both Movies are special because they show that ""love can overcome the odds regarding the age difference between the one you love and loving that person the way they are, whether or not they have a disability or limitation, or if they are in the same class as you financially or have a different stand politically"". Both these movies show that ""where there is a will, there is a way to bridge the gap between them and love one another and accept one another the way they are, no matter what""! I love these movies and get inspired by them everytime I watch them, because they remind me that ""true love lasts forever, because you are willing to work on your relationship every day, by loving each other always unconditionally"".",1192579200,5,724,4.576923076923077
8201860,5,B000ROAMEI,Touching story.... was looking for a long time for this film starring Candice Bergen,1515715200,,84,5.071428571428571
8201861,3,B000ROAMEI,Actually the movie Ronnie and Julie is awful. Worst ever for awful script. Horrible dialogue. Terrible acting! The worst. BUT it's worth seeing for one reason and one reason alone. Two words: Joshua Jackson! Look him up and you will see what I mean. Also on a light note...the little girl who plays Willa. She's funny. And she screams constantly but no one pays attention to her. Ever. And she's only 8 years old so also a very odd plot point. Never saw Tim and Mary....except in real life when my classmates Tim and Mary got married.,1487203200,,534,4.515463917525773
