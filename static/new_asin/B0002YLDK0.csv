8034991,5,B0002YLDK0,"What makes a human a human is explored often in fiction and especially in fiction that involves human-like creatures who aren't quite human. Kikaider/Jiro is such a thing, a special android built with a ""conscience circuit"" (this isn't exactly a hard science show) called Gemini that allows him to experience human emotion. The focus of this series is Jiro's variously struggling with and accepting his own unique existence. The show goes out of its way for Pinocchio comparisons and even reads from the book a number of times, but its a fitting little metaphor and ties together well the various human themes in it.

There's also a rather stock mad scientist (Dr. Gill) and evil organization (DARK) that he has to contend with. Although the show can be quite exciting and there are many fights in it, it never once feels like just another boys' manga action show. The violence is weighted with consequence and can even be rather gruesome at times. The soul of the show though is Jiro and Mitsuko's personal journeys. Mitsuko is the estranged daughter of the scientist who built Kikaider, who is also in deep emotional turmoil for reasons of her own, and has grown to care for the android almost as a sibling... or maybe something else. I don't want to give too much away. It's really interesting to see all the various human and inhuman traits reflected, contrasted, and paralleled with each other through the characters and situations. DARK's robots, lacking in conscience circuits, don't seem to follow their evil orders out of sheer design, but almost in some disturbing belief in the essential righteousness of robots following the orders of humans. Dr. Gill even seems to personally hate Kikaider, not merely for ruining his various evil schemes, but for having the conscience circuit at all.

There's a lot of food for thought here about humanity, technology, choice, and existence. While these themes were present in the rather unique, though still very cheesy, 70's tokusatsu show which Kikaider originates from, they were explored in much more depth in this moody anime. It's a beautiful melodrama that can have you falling in love with the characters, interspersed with robot fights and existentialism, and it pays off wonderfully. A great series and maybe Shotaro Ishinomori's most powerful creation.",1403740800,,2312,5.033942558746737
8034992,5,B0002YLDK0,I remember watching this on adult swim. it was real good. the music is what got me into it yup,1356739200,,94,3.75
8034993,2,B0002YLDK0,"For those people out there already familiar with Kikaider, I present you with an INFORMED review.
As far as my research goes, this is not the ""Perfect"" collection, in that it is missing the 2003 OAV special ""Kikaider vs. Inazuman.""  I realize this is because that was never released in the U.S., but incomplete is still incomplete.  So don't shell out the $125+ dollars thinking you're going to get that rare gem, because you're not.

That being said, Kikaider is an excellent show.  If you don't believe me, Google it and educate yourself.  The animation is older, yes, and the story is derived from a live-action ""henshin"" series from the 1970's (Kikaider to Power Rangers: ""Who's your daddy?"") but if you have a place in your heart for clashing robots and forbidden love (two great flavors that taste great together) than I urge you to give this show a try.

Now if I could just find that OAV special...",1223683200,5,906,4.666666666666667
8034994,4,B0002YLDK0,"I just saw the first episode, and I can't really say anything else other than that the series looks promising. The animation is... unique, but who wants to see the same style over and over again.

Dr. Komyoji has created Jiro (who has the ability to transform into Kikaider). He has real emotions just like humans he evens sheds real tears and he's an android. He carries a gutair on his back.",1127779200,2,393,4.458333333333333
8034995,2,B0002YLDK0,"I'm sorry if I offended anybody, but this is awful. The plot of android kikiader revolves around an android named jiro aka kikaider, and his struggle against Dr. Gill and his own awakening humanity. Jiro was given a 'gemini circut' which allows him to act/be? human-like. If this was the first ever show to exploit this idea, then it would be brilliant, however it is now so overused in sci-fi that it is practically it's own genre. For the protagonist we have jiro, a run of the mill android with a need to be human, so we have a bunch of other characters that feel sorry for him. One scene involves kikaider sitting in a park, looking at a girl, kikaider looks at the girl playing, and somehow wishes he could feel hapiness(how is he supposed to do that?). So he runs away from all the other characters, only to find that the 'love' him and wish he was human. I could not bear to watch more than a few episodes of this, being that it is so sappy and cliched it is not even worth watching. However the show does have good points in it's animation quality, which is quite good, however otherwise stay away from this.",1101340800,2,1116,4.3701923076923075
8034996,5,B0002YLDK0,"The genius robotics professor Dr. Komyoji has created Kikaider, a humanoid robot gifted with a 'conscience circuit' enabling Kikaider to simulate real emotions and distingusih between right and wrong.

""Jiro"", as he is called by Dr. Komyoji's children Mitsuko and Masaru, finds himself struggling to protect Mitsuko and Masaru from the evil Dr. Gill and his androids, and also to understand his own conflicted emotions. Is the conscience circuit a blessing or a curse?

Kikaider, in my own view, is a must own to all anime lovers. It is indeed a depressing series, but it does have its moments where the scenes are thoughtful and heart-warming. Kikaider's basic storyline is that of Pinnochio, though it is based more off of the story than rather retold.

The series starts off with the beginning of Pinnochio, and then develops on its own from there, telling about a scientist who makes an android used to fight evil, while the android tries to figure out his emotions, and whether he is a 'good robot', a 'bad robot', or even just a 'mad machine'.

""Jiro"", otherwise known as Kikaider to the evil forces, struggles to find his existance, and why he feels the way he does. Yet the more he finds out, the more he wants to become human - and find out why he feels differently than those that are human.

The DVD itself has very few features, but it does have a gallery where you can look at screen shots that are taken throughout the series, such as action shots, and poses that the characters are in. Also, the perfect box set also has four episodes after it - the series of Kikaider 01.

If you like robots and very good plots, then this is an EXCELLENT anime for you to own.",1100822400,14,1676,4.588628762541806
