Leina'ala also teaches a fun 'learning' warm up before you start, along with a few hawaiian words (other than the basic hula steps).  Granted, it's not performed in 'mirror image'~ but Leina'ala is a more graceful dancer whose heart really seems to be with the kids. Hope this helps..=) LeiLani Ke'Aloha !!!",1051660800,9,547,4.757894736842105

7883710,5,6305137773,Excellent kid friendly video.  Easy step-by-step instructions and fun music!  I used this video with group of over forty 2 - 5 year old children for our luau day.  I used it mainly to introduce hula to them and it turned out being very cute to  watch them follow along.  A few children even got the hang of it after watching only once.  The adults assisting also caught on quite easily.,1386547200,,386,4.366197183098592

7883714,4,6305137773,"A happy, delightful introduction to some easy hulas. Taina is a pleasant teacher and the children are cutie pies. The mirror-style teaching is effective and both my girls got started in hula based on this video. The only drawback is relatively poor image quality that's about the same on the VHS as the DVD. Further, the DVD does not divide the class into sections. It's one long video chapter so it is an honest pain to try and get back to particular parts because you have to manually scan the DVD.",1335571200,3,500,4.5054945054945055

6 year old grand daughter's Hawaiian Birthday Party we played the video and with no prompting from me, or my daughter, all of the girls joined in and were transfixed for the whole video. I highly recommend this video.",1326067200,3,346,4.338461538461538
