4521666,4,B0051GLDQS,"Another open ended plot which I liked about it... Didn't have the shock value of the first one but I thought it was well done... The lead character, Jenny (Mercedes Masohn) was definitely a hottie... I think the zombie makeup in Q2 more resembled the makeup effects in REC and REC 2... was probably intentional after all the user reviews... The REC fanboys spoiled it for the fans of Quarantine... I personally liked the makeup effects better in Quarantine... Q2 had a DTV production quality about it but the acting was very good...
I couldn't help but be reminded of James Cameron's ""Aliens"" in some scenes in Q2... especially the scene in the airplane cargo hold when they were looking through the luggage... Tribute to ""Aliens"" without a doubt... just like the elevator scenes in the first Quarantine film were inspired by the scenes in ""Aliens""...
I wonder if there will be a Quarantine 3... I don't want to give away a spoiler but... the plot suggests all hell breaking loose if there is a Q3...",1308787200,5,1000,4.6875

4521668,4,B0051GLDQS,"Quarantine 2 was a good movie... unlike most sequels this one ran parallel with the first one. Has a huge feeling like Resident Evils' (the game) story line. Watching it and then thinking about going on a plane with someone coughing or sickly, I think not haha. All in all I give this movie a thumbs up :)",1308528000,,305,4.275862068965517
4521669,4,B0051GLDQS,"Great movie. As a teacher, it reminded me when one child comes to school with a cough and by the end of the day kids are puking everywhere and your smothering yourself with hand sanitizer and popping vitamin Cs like there M&Ms. One of my favorites!",1488067200,,248,4.413043478260869

4521671,4,B0051GLDQS,"I really feel it deserves a 4 1/2 stars.  Good acting, intense, lots of edge of your seat and an unusual storyline.

As a thriller/horror flick, this is a really good one.",1486944000,,302,4.172413793103448

The characters were dumb and the acting was subpar. the ending was the worst part. VERY anticlimactic.

The only reason I won't give this movie 5 stars is because I found it odd how the govt. just doesn't destroy all life in the terminal to destroy the virus, once the vaccine-test mission failed.

4521748,4,B0051GLDQS,"Quarantine 2: Terminal
 Quarantine covers a Zombie outbreak in an apartment building in L.A.  Shortly after the end of that movie, or even as it continues, a small passenger jet takes off from LAX with a light load of passengers.  They don't get very far before bad things start to happen.  The outbreak in the apartment building was not successfully contained.  A behemoth of a passenger turns Zombie.  The pilots return the plane to an airport where it is isolated.  The passengers escape into the isolated and sealed terminal.  What happens next to the marooned crew and passengers unfolds in Quarantine 2: Terminal.
 Quarantine and the excellent Spanish film REC are identical to each other, almost frame for frame.  Quarantine 2 however is its own entity.  Although director John Pogue has a few other directing credits, he is best known for his screen writing.  He wrote the story or the screenplay for U.S. Marshals, Ghost Ship and The Skulls, a diverse set of films.  His Quarantine 2 has adequate writing and skillful directing.  These laudatory achievements bring this movie into the top rank of Zombie flick with a solid three brain rating.
 Pogue was blessed with a $4 million budget with which he hired a skilled and experienced cast from TV land.  The lovely and professional actresses Bre Blair and Mercedes Masohn play the intrepid stewardesses, receptively Paula and Jenny.  The pair are at the heart of the film.  Young females who must step up to protect their charges when the cockpit crew stays on the plane to contain the berserk, ravenous and very large patient zero.  Masohn particularly had an actual acting assignment to work on, which she did in fine style.
 Also from TV land is Josh Cooke who plays a handsome passenger, a man with a mysterious cargo and a compelling story of his being a PHD scientist.  Ignacio Serricchio rounds out the major characters.  Serriccihio and Masohn played together on the entertaining but short lived TV show The Finder which I also liked.
 Quarantine 2 lasts an almost perfectly average for a Zombie movie one hour and 29 minutes.  It is rated with a hard R for language and the usual chomping and munching we expect with movies of this sort.  The Zombies and quick, deadly and very scary.  The make up is at the best levels of Hollywood special effects.  Interestingly enough, the actual Zombie attacks are infrequent and over quickly.  The charm of the movie is in the pacing and ample (for Zombie flicks) character development.  Even if this is not a direct descendant of the excellent REC films it does continue that story line and holds up very well in that tradition.  Some find it derivative and unoriginal and they may be right.  I say, So?.  By the standards of the genre, this is a good movie in all respects.",1413590400,,2781,4.765199161425577

4521760,5,B0051GLDQS,"First I must say I'm a big fan of the first Quarantine movie and this one was no exception.
Synopsis : A plan of passengers is leaving Los Angeles airport late one night and some of the passengers are watching the local news about a "" flu "" outbreak in great Los Angeles.
One of the planes passengers makes the comment that he's glad their "" headed away "" from it which means of coarse like all good horror movies that he's wrong and will soon learn the hard way.
Early symptoms of the virus are weakness and nausea turning into uncontrollable violence and of coarse one of the passengers is infected, becomes violent and has to be subdued by the stewardesses and passengers.
When the captain alerts the airport he is ordered to return to L.A. airport and on arriving direct the passengers to a hangars who thinking the worst is over soon find their nightmare has just begun.
The acting, writing and direction are first rate in addition to the makeup.

This is similer in that, the premise is almost the same ""A 'disease' breaks out in a confined space, putting a group of people at risk. These people get sealed off from the outside world and must fight to survive"". This movie is different in that: it is not a found footage movie, the characters interact better, the location is more unpredictable and you should feel for these characters whilst being scared also.

Do I think this moive is better then the first? Yes, due to feeling for the characters. There are two weaknesses with this movie however. One, the last couple deaths felt a little weak and two the very last scene in the movie was not needed.",1391558400,,746,4.567164179104478

4521780,3,B0051GLDQS,"Rec is a great modern horror movie, it uses the hand held technique of camera work.  It was redone for English Audiences almost shot for shot in Quarantine. Which is just as good as rec basically. Rec then had two sequels. Rec 2 and rec 3.  Rec 2 was very good and rec 3 was ok but it had demons in it! Anyways over here they made this  straight to dvd movie sequel ""quarantine 2'; rec 2 and 3 were shown at theatres like rec and quarantine were. Anyways that is the history of the rec franchise to date. Now this sequel does not have the hand held camera approach of ""rec"" or quarantine"" , but it ties in directly to the first movie. As a plane takes off we see them watching the news on the planes seat viewing screens. It's the same night as the first movie and the apartment complex is being quarantined. One of the people from that building escaped earlier and is on the plane with infected rats. Well the virus gets out as you expect and from there it's a movie about people quarantined in a terminal. It's what I expected and it does have some good gore shots. Although not on the level of 'rec 2 or rec 3 mind you.  It's a average b movie from then on. But it's not bad at all. It had a decent budget and was released by Sony. So it's not a super low budgeter. this was done by seasoned professionals. That is saying something in the world of b and c movies etc.  It's worth watching if you like these type of movies and it has no surprises because lets face it you have seen it before. It's nothing special but it's not on the level of a c movie. The picture on the dvd is good but this was available in HD on Netflix so it's a shame they didn't do a blu release. After all dvd's are on the way out.",1372982400,,1708,4.041420118343195

4521782,3,B0051GLDQS,"I was a fan of the first movie and so I was curious as to where the story was heading. This movie kind of ties up some loose ends from the first one but in all it was pretty predictable. The cast was good but talk about stereotypes, they portrayed a cross section of your typical air travelers and not necessarily in a good way! The moral of the story is that air travel is not safe which most of us already know! If you liked the first one then you will probably like this one too. If you have not seen either I'd watch the first one before this one! It's also rather graphic in places so if your squeamish you might want to give it a pass. Like the first one it doesn't end well for anyone so I'm sure there will be  third one!",1370995200,3,729,3.9591836734693877
4521783,2,B0051GLDQS,"A deadly virus overtakes the passengers of a small aircraft, forcing the plane to the ground as the infected begin to lash out in violent rage. Once docked, the crew realize that the terminal has been sealed up to prevent the spread of the disease, and those left standing must struggle to find a way out! QUARANTINE 2 is a pathetic excuse for a film that manages to avoid every single quality that made [REC] and the first QUARANTINE so utterly terrifying. The preposterous characters and events make it impossible to take the film seriously at any point, which is made worse by the careless lapses in logic and poor film making techniques. All of the claustrophobic intensity of the cramped aircraft setting is released along with the passengers when they are allowed to exit the plane and go running around the empty terminal. There is absolutely no consistency in the rate at which the infected turn violent, which makes for a further lack of suspense as the characters rush around attempting to save those who have been bitten. In a moment of laugh-out-loud absurdity, the lead actress and her young ward fumble around blindly for a gun that they dropped in a plainly-lit set which was supposed to be pitch black. John Pogue gives us nothing more than a series of cheap shocks in a film that shows all of the skill and intelligence of a poorly-drawn made-for-TV movie. This is a prime example to demonstrate just how effective the Spanish [REC} truly was, and for what reasons. QUARANTINE 2 will have you yelling at the screen in frustration.

I Like Horror Movies",1359676800,,1581,4.728260869565218
4521784,3,B0051GLDQS,"I would like to first start off by saying that i liked the first movie ""Quarantine"". I usually don't like the first person viewpoint movies, but for this genre, it was pretty nice to see a change up. I think this sequel ruined some of the charm from the first one. The infected people were slightly different in the sequel, which was naturally for the worse, and the characters seemed to be dumber than the average horror movie victim. We've seen enough TV and movies to know when a person gets bit by somebody who is foaming from the mouth, you should probably steer clear of that person. and when the recently bit, starts biting others, you should see a pattern developing and do something about it. You aren't supposed to play dumb until you're dead, mainly because it aggravates the audience. I feel like I just watched 10 people in a room with with a zombie and each of them taking turns getting bit, while the next in line says, ""Are you ok?""

Having complained a little, I'll admit there was a nice location choice with the terminal, I was really glad they didn't stay on the plane.the gore was pretty good and the actors did a good job portraying idiots and infected people. the CDC/Super sneaky agency was again merciless which kept a nice ""No way out"" feeling throughout the movie. the ending was less than par and i feel like it could have ended up just as good without trying to give closure/reasoning to the outbreak story. the backstory should have been left to the viewers imagination. In all the movie wasn't completely terrible, but the character decisions annoyed me and the revealing of the ""How it all started, who did it, and what's next"" was pretty disappointing. so three stars from me.

Hope this helps.",1357171200,2,1727,4.585760517799352
4521785,5,B0051GLDQS,"Very well done. Very scary. Keeps you on the edge. You won,t go wrong buying this dvd. It was money well spent. I recomened this movie.",1356307200,,135,4.230769230769231
4521786,2,B0051GLDQS,"While many people threw their usual ""remakes are bad!"" fit when the first Quarantine came out, I thought it was good. I liked [REC] better, but when it came down to it, Quarantine was nearly the exact same movie, shot for shot, and if I hadn't seen [REC] first, I might have liked it more instead. [REC]'s sequel didn't do anything for me and ended up disappointing me more than anything else. Quarantine 2, oddly enough, did the same thing. I had to watch this movie over the course of a week, watching about 15 minutes here and there, watching other movies instead, and coming back to it, only forcing myself to see how it ends in the off chance that something cool happened. Look, I'm not the kind of guy who oogles over actresses in a movie, saying that they make it worth watching, but this is one of those few times where I'll say that the best thing about the movie is the leading lady. Quarantine 2 tones down everything that made the first one worth watching. Unless you have a fear of flying, and maybe airports too, there's nothing here that'll scare anyone who's seen a horror movie before.

Rather than picking up where the last one left off, we meet a new group of characters as they board a plane. Everything starts out as normal, until a man brings on his kindergarten class' hamsters. No one checks to see what's in the cage, and he's allowed to put them in the overhead storage with other luggage. The plane's full of a bunch of clichs: a couple that can't keep their hands off eachother, the seemingly nice guy who flirts with one of the stewardesses, an arrogant jerk (for lack of better word), quiet computer guy, the obligatory overweight guy, an elderly couple, an elderly woman with a cat, and the lone angsty pre-teen boy who chooses to keep his hood on for 95% of the movie, no matter how bad things get. The flight goes on as usual until a man is bitten by one of the 'hamsters' when he helps move the cage. Soon after, he goes nuts. His eyes change, he makes weird sounds, and he tries to kill everyone in sight. After biting a woman, he's restrained and locked in the plane's bathroom until they can make an emergency landing. Once they land, no one's there to greet them or go about the usual protocol. Instead, everyone's locked in the terminal with armed guards outside the building. They've been quarantined.

The name of the movie might be Quarantine 2: Terminal, and give away where most of the movie will take place, though I think it would've worked better if more time had been spent on the plane. Not a lot of time, but enough to really get things rolling. The first third of the movie was doing just fine. It wasn't anything special but I was curious to see where they were going with it. As soon as they arrive though, everything became stale. The terminal is nowhere near as scary as the huge apartment from the original, partially because not enough time is spent with the location. The massive apartment building was thoroughly explored, and it seemed like a maze with very few chances for escape if you got cornered. Here, everyone seems pretty capable in the terminal, finding little passages easily in the dark. What got me the most however, was how tame the kills are. More gore doesn't make a good horror movie, I know, but the director chose to go with less is more, with a couple of the victims getting bitten off-camera. There's no memorable kill to be found in this movie, and that's part of what got me so bored. Most of the characters aren't likable either, which I guess isn't anything new since your average horror movie doesn't get you too involved with them. Quarantine 2 isn't a disaster, it just could've been a little bit better with enough effort.

As far as the good goes, Mercedes Mashn as stewardess Jenny, is gorgeous. Does that make me sound like the average guy? Probably. Did she make the movie a little easier to get through? Absolutely. She's also one of the only characters that has a little bit of personality and does her best to take charge of a situation where there's no leader. The only other pro I can think of is that they chose to not remake the second [REC], scene for scene. This is an entirely different movie, and I'm glad I wasn't watching what would've essentially been a translated version of the sequel. Even better- it's not a found footage movie! Oh, and I suppose it was nice to see them continue with the first Quarantine's plot of how the disease came to be. It's kind of shoehorned in, but it's there.

Quarantine 2: Terminal is most likely only going to win over teenagers who haven't seen many horror movies. It's a big step down from the original, and while [REC]2 wasn't that great either, it was better than this. Skip it unless you're really, really bored.",1355788800,3,4758,4.503472222222222
4521787,2,B0051GLDQS,"If you're the type who browses the sort of websites that point out logic fails & plotholes, or are simply the observant type who has difficulty suspending your disbelief, this movie is not for you.

The first movie used the found-footage formula & therefore wanted you to pretend to think of how it could be real. The sequel drops all pretenses & jumps right into horror fantasy. The end result is that you remember what type of movie the first one was & it kills your suspension of disbelief for the followup.

Pros: Dropping the found-footage formula does make the movie less annoying than it could have been. The only other good things I can say about it is that it has a pretty realistic airplane flight that doesn't feel overly-scripted & it refrains from showing any violence towards animals. If I'm not mistaken, the movie seems to be a bit of an homage to Steven King's Langoleers, or at least kept reminding me of it.

Cons: Given that the previous movie wanted us to believe it could be real, I have a hard time believing the following can happen in the real world: A blatantly sick pilot being permitted to fly without being sent home on mandatory sick leave, a stewardess flirting with a passenger while on duty, the inhuman noises the Infected make (Cougar screams, pig squeals, & dog barks), the airport fails to knowledge the emergency landing & actually asks them to reboard & leave, pets are allowed in the passenger compartment, an off-duty physician carrying around medical equipment & medicine with no red tape & paperwork involved in freelancing with them, none of the characters believe that humans can get rabies, human teeth biting through a hasmat suit & face mask hard enough to tear flesh, 99.9% of the people in this movie are white & thin, the Infected move beyond what human testosterone & physics would allow, & can smell like animals despite the fact that the virus couldn't have possibly have tripled the amount of receptors in their olfactory epithelium, & they also pack instead of attacking eachother like they can somehow tell from a distance that another infected isn't a normal person.

Other cons: Predictable cliches; Best friend dies, an enemy is kidnapped for exposition before dying. The only fat guy in the movie tells a fat joke, & the timing of events are very contrived.",1350777600,,2318,4.744416873449132

Once the action kicks in & people start getting infected with the same virus that infected people in the first film, I was confused as to whether I was watching Quarantine or some kind of Hulk movie. The special effects are horrible. In the first film, the infected had dilated pupils which was more effective. In this one, their eyes are just blood shot. If it's one thing I hate, it's a sequel that doesn't show continuity in every possible way. Some of the cast is believable while others aren't. The gore that they've decided to show isn't realistic at all. Is it the worst horror movie I've seen? No. But it's far from better than the first one like so many other reviewers have said. It just goes to show you that you can't always listen to reviews, you have to see it yourself. But while this movie was ok for a one time viewing, that's about it.

4521789,3,B0051GLDQS,"In Quarantine 2: Terminal (2011), a passenger on a flight from Los Angeles becomes sick and turns violent, forcing the plane to land in Las Vegas, where a disease that turns people into flesh eaters, soon begins to spread.  Unfortunately, while the movie gets off to a decent start, it then takes some whacky turns, and by the end becomes pretty much a mess.  Some spoilers follow.

In the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>&nbsp;(2008), the authorities locked down an apartment building, in an attempt to contain a viral outbreak with rabies like symptoms, that turns people into bloodthirsty freaks.  In the sequel Quarantine 2: Terminal, someone from that same building is on the flight, carrying a source of the disease, which quickly spreads from one passenger to others once the plane lands.  Already briefed about the danger, the authorities in Vegas lock down the neatly deserted terminal.

With most of the crew either dead or incapacitated, Jenny (Mercedes Masohn) a flight attendant, attempts to take charge of the group, which includes baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio), and passengers Shilah (Noree Victoria), Henry (Josh Cooke), and George (Mattie Liptak) a young boy.  Men dressed in biosuits enter the hangar, and inject something into some of the survivors, but the ""cure"" fails, and the team and some of the survivors are killed.  Ramirez conveniently remembers about an abandoned tunnel, and what's left of the group attempts to evade the infected and find a way out.

Writer/director John Pogue (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Marshals/dp/B0076YFJUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Marshals</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Ship/dp/B002CVQAX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Ship</a>) has done some decent work in the past, but after a nice start, Quarantine 2 becomes formulaic and just not very good.  The group are mostly stock characters, annoying and not particularly intelligent.  It's clear that many of them will not last long, and by the time the group finally has a plan of action, most of them have already become infected.

There are several attack scenes, but few are executed very well, as there seems to be a lot of grappling, and quick cutting to speed things up.  The group does manage a few good kills, including a creative chase on a baggage conveyor, and a group strangulation using a cable.

The film has a deadly serious tone, but the ridiculous plot and brain dead characters, makes it hard to take seriously, once things start to get nasty.  The story also contains mad scientist and conspiracy elements, as the character responsible for the outbreak, is also involved in developing the virus, and testing it on humans.  In a horror movie with mostly adults, it's usually not a good sign when a smartass kid is the most intelligent character.  Things really get stupid when thermal vision goggles are used to provide advance warning of the presence of the infected.  It's completely ridiculous, when characters are apparently unable to see, yet are clearly visible on the screen.  And the movie's final scenes in a tunnel, are pathetically bad.

Taken by itself, Quarantine 2 is subpar unoriginal outbreak flick, that is much less entertaining than the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B000TUDIL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;(2007), which granted has a different approach.  Compared to Quarantine, which featured a live video approach, Quarantine 2 is an inferior disappointment, which is almost humorously bad at times.

Quarantine was a virtual remake of the Spanish horror film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec/dp/B0028DRGDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[Rec] </a>&nbsp;(2007), a movie with genuinely creative writers who expanded their ideas in their sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec-2/dp/B0056AFSTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[Rec] 2</a>&nbsp;(2009).  A comparison between Quarantine 2 and [REC] 2 isn't fair or perhaps relevant, but it is interesting to note that while [REC] 2 explores new ground, and again is creatively shot in the live video style, the lower budget Quarantine 2 recycles the same old zombie movie clichs, offering nothing new, and featuring a kid a major player.  While below average, if you just can't get your fill of zombie types, you might give Q2 a watch.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1348272000,,4675,6.089939024390244

""Quarantine"" was a nearly shot-for-shot remake of the Spanish horror film ""REC"" with an important exception: the zombie virus was changed from a mystical contagion to a more mundane form of ""human rabies."" This change left more questions than answers: Why were there religious articles taped to the wall of the lab? What's with the freaky little kid at the end? What did the audio tape really say? ""Quarantine 2"" has all the answers.

 ""Quarantine 2"" begins on an airplane but it doesn't stay there for long. The flight from Los Angeles is disrupted when big Ralph (George Back) becomes infected and spreads the infection to stewardess Paula (Bre Blair). The pilots make an emergency landing in a Las Vegas airport only to discover that the entire terminal has been quarantined. Get it? Terminal? Quarantine? Ahem.

Captain Forrest (John Curran) and his co-pilot Wilson (Andrew Benator) agree to keep Ralph penned up in the plane's bathroom while the few redeye passengers try to get help. It's not that simple of course. With the exception of baggage handler Ed (Ignacio Serricchio), the survivors soon discover that they're locked inside the terminal. This won't end well for heroine Jenny (Mercedes Masohn), spunky military medic Shilah (Noree Victoria), crazy cat lady, pregnant lady and her angry boyfriend, business guy more concerned about his laptop that other people's lives, and the couple that doesn't speak English but does naughty things on airplanes. They're all here to die for our amusement and it's a testament to the scriptwriters that they mostly die without succumbing to the typical victim movie tropes.

Along the way ""Quarantine 2"" answers all the mysteries left dangling by the tweaks made to the ""REC""/Quarantine conversion. SPOILER 2: Vatican investigators and demonic possession are replaced by doomsday cultists and biological contagions.  ""Quarantine 2"" shifts gears from survival to explanation about halfway through, although the arch villain's rationale isn't particularly unique to smooth-talking virus-spreading maniacs.

 ""Quarantine 2"" is less interested in wrapping things up than it is in spreading things around. But that's okay. It's a frighteningly good tale about bio-terrorism, the human spirit, and misplaced trust in authority.",1335225600,,2403,5.358090185676392

4521794,2,B0051GLDQS,"<strong>Quarantine 2: Terminal</strong> (John Pogue, 2011)

What was it, exactly, that told me that watching <em>Quarantine 2: Terminal</em> was going to be a good idea in any possible way? What kept me watching it when I realized it wasn't going to be a remake of Paco Plaza's sequel to the original film, <em>[REC] 2</em>? (Which is actually pretty good--certainly better than this.) Let's see: you have a first-time director who is best-known for writing the screenplay of the forgettable teen thriller <em>The Skulls</em> over a decade ago, none of the original cast returning (though to be fair, that would have been kind of difficult--Plaza pulled it off, however), and a script that... okay, yes, it really <em>is</em> <em>Outbreak on a Plane</em>. That a movie already exists with that subtitle does not seem to have fazed anyone involved with this production one bit. Oh, and did I mention Marcus Koch (responsible for the execrable <em>100 Tears</em>) was involved with the effects crew? By the time I got to the end of the credits, I was stunned--stunned, I tell you--not to see Brain Damage Films listed with a production credit. This monstrosity is right up their alley.

Plot: the virus from the original <em>Quarantine</em> finds its way onto a plane, which makes an emergency landing, after which some of the survivors and a helpful airport employee find themselves quarantined in an abandoned airport terminal. I'd tell you more about said survivors, but does it really matter? They're either entirely interchangeable or thin stereotypes you know are destined to get killed by the ever-increasing number of the infected.

Yep, that's it. There's no attempt to do anything to extend the idea in any way. For that matter, there's not even an attempt to make a movie that might stand up to the original (which, while completely unnecessary, was at least one of the more watchable Hollywood remakes of foreign horror films in recent memory); there are no characters in this script who even manage two-dimensionality, much less three. There is little attempt to build suspense (I get the feeling Pogue's idea of building suspense is the flinging of red herrings at you in the beginning as you try to figure out, if you actually care, which of the sick people boarding the plane has the virus and which just have colds), and once all hell breaks loose, the script doesn't even really try to make the infected into jump-enablers. And, of course, every major ""twist"" during the last half-hour is predictable pretty much from the beginning of the film.

On second thought, you can use this (just as in the literary world you can use Jodi Picoult's awful novel <em>My Sister's Keeper</em>) as an acid test for movie compatibility with acquaintances: if anyone didn't see the identity of the final girl, the identity of the virus carrier, etc. coming before its revelation, this is not someone you have movie acumen in common with. **",1332979200,,2940,4.981670061099797

This was a 2011 followup to the awesome 2008 flick, Quarantine.  And surprise surprise, the sequel is very, very good!  The movie does away with the hand-held camp POV of the first film, and I'm not sorry to see that go. The urgency of the hand-held video is replaced in the sequel with the dread and apprehension all travelers have of airports, airplane emegencies and Homeland Security.

The plot: One of the passengers on a red-eye flight from L.A. to Kansas City is bitten by an infected hamster/rat and he goes berserk. The plane is ordered to land in Vegas, and it docks at a terminal where the passengers and crew are isolated. They ae not allowed to leave, and the power is cut off. That's when the terror cranks up. The zombies of the Quarantine series are infected live humans -- fast-moving rabid lunatics who want to bite a chunk out of your flesh, similar to the zombies of 28 Days Later or Zombietown.  They're the most logical zombies of all, and my personal favorite.

One quibble:  The movie falls into Hollywood's easy racism.  A black guy is bitten early on.  The other passengers find him face down in a causeway and don't even turn him over before pronouncing ""he's dead"" and running away.  Needless to say, more care is taken with the white characters who get bitten.  It's like the producers included the black guy because they felt they had to have a black character, but wanted nothing to do with him. I actually empathized with the guy because he ws so focused on saving his computer presentation -- I've been there.  Dude needs to learn to carry his Powerpoint on a thumb drive.

My favorite part: One actor injects himself in his eye. EEKS! It actually looked real, though I assume there's some Hollywood magic involved.

Anyway, I give Quarantine 2 a big thumbs up and 4 1/2 stars.  Check it out if you're a zombie fan.",1323475200,,1874,4.568862275449102

This movie really scared me, just like the first one did. The movie takes place inside an airplane first and then moves to a airport terminal. The story in this one takes place around the same time as the first movie. You don't need to see the first movie to see this movie, because this movie actually explains about how it started and why. You can watch this movie first and then go back and watch the other one.

As you might know, this movie about people effected and these people are crazy. The crazy people can affect other people, if they are bitten by these crazy people. New in this the movie is how else can the people get affected. Rats also are affected and they can bit and give the virus to people and make them crazy.

I found the story to be okay. I didn't really like the whole purpose behind affecting people. I think I would had like a better story line and I could give it 5 stars. Or, if they would had just left out the reasoning to affecting and making the virus would had been better.

Stick with the originals Rec and Rec 2 for real horror.",1312761600,4,475,4.314606741573034
4521823,4,B0051GLDQS,"The first Quarantine, which was a so-so remake of the spectacular Spanish thriller [REC], spawns a direct to DVD sequel with Quarantine 2: Terminal, and the biggest surprise here is that this sequel is surprisingly good, and better than the film that came before it.  During the events of the first film, a plane taking off from Los Angeles ends up becoming the breeding ground for the same kind of rage/zombie virus for the crew and passengers alike, forcing them to land at a terminal and, you guessed it, get quarantined and race against the growing odds to survive.  What really makes Quarantine 2 so good is that it's surprisingly well-filmed, well-acted, and even more surprisingly taut and suspenseful as well.  Though it has its share of shortcomings, Quarantine 2 makes the most of its minimal budget and delivers the goods, which is something that many, many horror films of this type should take a big cue from.  Check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1312416000,10,969,4.8545454545454545
4521824,3,B0051GLDQS,"""Do not attempt to leave the terminal, help is on the way. You are now under quarantine."" After a passenger attacks others on a plane, the pilot makes an emergency landing. When they discover that the terminal is locked down and there is no escape things only get worse when the sickness spreads. I will admit that I thought the first ""Quarantine"" was pretty slow and boring. This one for the first 30-45 min was actually entertaining and a good watch. Then, like the first one, becomes very, very repetitive and slows way down. The character development is lacking and you don't really feel to much for any of the people in the movie, but after watching the first one you pretty much know what to expect from this one. The best part about it is that it is shot like an actual movie, and not the grainy, green feel of the first one. Overall, a much better movie then the first one, but the ""Rec"" movies are still better. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will

4521826,2,B0051GLDQS,"The creators of Quarantine stole another film idea. This time they ripped off ""Flight of the Living Dead"" (which is a much better movie BTW) and slapped a ""Quarantine 2"" sticker on it. The first Quarantine movie was a rip off of the Spanish film ""Rec"". This rip off was the worst movie I've had the misfortune of seeing. the plot was weak, the acting was terrible and the special fx needed help. What happened to original film making? What happened to great story telling and film making?....It's still happening...only in Spain as far as the Quarantine movies are concerned.",1309996800,,575,4.76
4521827,5,B0051GLDQS,"I thought the first movie was lousy. I watched this one with extreme prejudice. The movie starts building the characters of 2 stewardesses. Then as they help and greet passengers we get a glimpse of the passenger backgrounds. We already know there is going to be an infection, but who? The co-pilot is sick. He thinks he got it from his dog. There is a woman on board from an apartment building. Her cat is with her. The cat had left the building which she claims is very unusual. There is a man with some hamsters. Another man helps him with the hamsters and gets bit. There is an elderly man who is sick along with his wife, and a woman who has just returned from overseas, and a few others. A man is watching the events unfold from outside the apartment building from the first picture on his laptop. This one picks up where the other leaves off except the action is in an airplane.

Once a passenger gets infected and isolated in the restroom, the plane is told to land. It hooks up to a terminal where they are quarantined. Now it is just a matter of who lives and who dies.

The first thing I noticed is they got rid of the hand held camera nonsense and had enough money to make this into a regular movie. They still jerked the camera around when an infected human attacked to give you that terror feel. The animal sounds made by the infected humans didn't seem to be real or coming from the people making them. There is room for improvement as they kept the door open for an infinite amount of sequels.

Acting was a lot better than the first one. Better story line. Quick and effective introduction of characters before the action starts.

MF/F-bomb, no nudity, some implied sex, no real sex scenes.  four and a half stars.",1309564800,28,1731,4.38006230529595
4521828,5,B0051GLDQS,"I just finished watching Q2. Awesome, kicka** movie. DEFINITELY a must have for my video library.

Quarantine was good, I really liked it. Q2 smokes it, hands down.

All unknown ""noname"" actors, but you really couldn't tell. Great acting, great special effects. The lighting sometimes left something to be desired, but that barely hurt this flick. *NOTE* I don't have an HDtv, just an old fashioned SD 26"" screen so that could be a factor ;)

I don't want to give any spoilers, I personally hate that. All I can say is, if you thought Quarantine was good you HAVE to see this flick.

Okay, 1 ***SPOILER ALERT*** (kind of)....
This isn't a sequel. It happens in the same time frame as Quarantine does/did. Q is referenced several times in this movie. It was like----- ""and meanwhile at the airport....."" lol

I'm a zombie-phile, so I don't really consider this a zombie flick. More like an ""infected"" flick. But that does NOT take anything away from this movie. It is on the same level as any of the so-called Blockbusters released lately IMHO

I found the DVD release date on another site...August 2, 2011. Whether that is right, I can only hope. I do have digital copies of quite a few movies, but I like to have a hard copy of some as well. This is at the top of my ""gotta have"" list.

8452661,3,B0051GLDQS,"Trans Sky Air, Flight 318, departing from LAX to parts unknown. It's not a packed crowd what's boarded, its make-up running the spectrum of humanity, from the PhD guy with the hamsters to the old lady with the cat, to the jerk with the pregnant wife, and the 12-year-old boy flying solo, the combat medic with the fear of flying, and the fat golfer who always brings his extended seat belt, and a few other folks. And the flight crew: two pilots, two flight attendants: Paula (Bre Blair), who is engaged, and the adventurous, fun-loving Jenny (Mercedes Mason), who seems projected to be our main character.

It's a horror sequel that works, partly because it's executed right and partly because of where the story takes place. What's more conducive to crippling claustrophobia than being in a plane in mid-flight and trapped in with zombies? But then they land. For the longest time I'd stayed away from the Quarantine series, frankly, because I'd seen the original Spanish series, [Rec], and I didn't think a remake could do it justice. Except Quarantine was almost as good as the first [Rec], and so, I thought I'd give the sequel a go. Plus, Mercedes Mason is in it.

There's brief mention of some weird sh-- going down in an apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, so there's your tangential tie-in to the first movie. It's a scene that also informs us that both stories are taking place simultaneously. [Rec] 2 returns us to the infected apartment building whereas Quarantine 2: Terminal shears away from that plot and plows ahead as its own movie. Sure, ""Terminal"" is in the movie title, but I'd still assumed that the plane would be the central hub of the plot. The scenes of the passengers confined in the plane with an infected were the most harrowing. I love the [Rec] series very much, especially its first two movies. Quarantine 2 isn't as good as those first two or as good as the first Quarantine. It's still a very serviceable zombie picture. There are some likable characters here: mostly Jenny but also the other flight attendant, the combat medic (Noree Victoria), and the baggage attendant (Ignacio Serricchio). As per usual, it's not advised that you get too attached to anyone in these horror shows.

I'd worked out a scene in my brain that extrapolates off the scene in which a frightened Jenny rings up her dad to ask for his advice. I pictured Ruben Blades on the other end, dispensing tough love. As you know, Mercedes Mason plays Ofelia Salazar in Fear the Walking Dead. Her dad on FtWD is, of course, the badass Daniel Salazar, played by Ruben Blades.

Quarantine 2: Terminal ranks a bit higher than a middle-of-the-pack zombie flick. The budget gets put to good use. The scare tactics aren't original but they're effective enough. The most creepy, grossest moment isn't from a chase or kill sequence but from a scene in which a guy injects himself in the most horrible places. Again, it's key that the movie makes you care about its characters. And I cared about Jenny who keeps a plucky front even though she's falling apart inside. Zombie purists may snarl a bit since the creatures here aren't Romero's brain-munching shufflers, but more like the pissed-off, fast-moving rage monsters in 28 Days Later.

Some lessons learned from this movie on how to better survive the zompocalypse:

- When someone crawling behind you in a vent in the dark warns you that they're turning, it's not the time for denial
- In a zompocalypse - or any other sort of crisis - don't be that idiot who keeps filming with his smartphone instead of diving in to help
- When trapped in an isolated  terminal crawling with zombies, don't keep calling out people's names
- Just because an old guy has a stroke and is in a wheelchair doesn't mean he won't stand up and jump on your ass when he turns
- Never trust anyone who says, ""Earth could use a good plague.""
- Never throw away infrared goggles",1508630400,,3905,4.691970802919708

8452663,5,B0051GLDQS,"Having watched all of the Rec movies, they really became my favorite Zombie series movies to watch.  I enjoyed them so much that I watched each of them several times.  Then I stumbled upon Quaratine 1 and thought it was pretty much exactly like the Rec movies but just in English based in the US. I was hoping that they would have made more English movies based on the Rec series but could not find any.

One night after I did a search I came across Quarantine 2 and thought it would be like Rec 2 but, to my surprise this movie is based on a plane and nothing like Rec 2. Glad I bought this movie because I thought it was another great Zombie Movie! The actors really did a great job and it had a lot of suspenseful scenes in it too.  Being a Walking Dead fan and also a fan of Fear the Walking Dead, It was great to see some of Ophelia in this movie since I had not seen her in other movies.

I would recommend this movie to Zombie lovers even if you have not seen Quarantine 1, this movie will still keep you interested and you will understand the gist of what happened in the first movie.  If you have seen all the Rec movies this will not be like Rec 2 but it is still a great movie to watch.  Would recommend this to Zombie Movie Fans.",1502064000,2,1241,4.040816326530612
