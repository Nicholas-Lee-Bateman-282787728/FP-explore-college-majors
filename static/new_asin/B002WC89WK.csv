4006500,4,B002WC89WK,"First off, I'm only considering this because of my collections from 1 through 8, and for me eight's ending was perfect. However, I still have to support them, so I'll finish the actual series rather then the intended one. I did get to follow all the episodes for season 9, and some were pretty funny. Totally missed the Janitor the most, there were so many other characters missing, but it is what it is. Also, why no wide-screen ABC? Bad karma, you guys will get what you guys deserve, no threat intended; just reminding them of karma.

I highly recommend it to those who have the previous collections, because it shows support and the effort those guys ""tried"" to make the show a success.

I will miss Scrubs though, I loved the show... and now I owe them all.

4/5 because of the ratio, not in wide-screen.",1276387200,6,809,4.489795918367347
4006501,1,B002WC89WK,"This is presented in 1.33:1 (fullscreen), as opposed to its Original Aspect Ratio (1.78:1). This means you're missing about half the shot that was creatively intended to be in the image.",1276300800,25,186,5.032258064516129
4006502,5,B002WC89WK,I am so glad that they released it on DVD.  I have season 1-8 and am a Scrubs addict!  I think they ended the show with class considering that there wasn't even supposed to be a ninth season!  Because of that some of the characters weren't in it because they were working on other projects!  I can't wait to get this and add it to my collection!  If you are a SCRUBS die hard like me you should buy it!,1276128000,6,402,3.975
4006503,1,B002WC89WK,"Once again ABC Studios has chosen not to release the DVD version of Scrubs in the original aspect ratio in which it aired (16:9 widescreen), season 9 will be in 1.33:1 full frame. Screwing this up one time (as they did on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs-The-Complete-Eighth-Season-DVD/dp/B001VPJYZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs: The Complete Eighth Season DVD</a>) is begrudgingly understandable, but twice means they are deliberately releasing an inferior product so that people will double dip on the inevitable blu-ray, widescreen version. I say ""double dip"" because like the Season 8 sets, the inevitable blu-ray of season 9 will not be released on the same day as the DVD set.  Come Sept 28th your choice is either an inferior product or wait for the more expensive release to watch Season 9 in the framing the creators intended.

The cherry on top is this quasi-spinoff of Scrubs wasn't even that good, the character of Cole was perpetually annoying and Turk without Carla was a completely different character. I mean really, how the hell do you bring back a series regular character and not even have the actress who plays his WIFE back for at least ONE episode as a guest star?

4006524,2,B002WC89WK,"I just wanted to complete my collection, even though I had purposely stopped buying at season 8 for a reason.  Despite having not-great memories about this season, and despite other reviews stating their disappointment, I thought maybe since it'd been a while since I'd seen this, maybe it wasn't so bad.  Well, it was!  I almost want to just give it away to a thrift store and am so frustrated and disappointed on how things ended with season 8, but also how they ended here.  As others have said, the completely different set without explanation, the new cast with RARE appearances by Elliot and JD, Carla never appearing- it's not the same show and did nothing to further the rest of the seasons.  The humor was largely lost on me, too.  If you are looking to complete your collection and haven't seen this last season in a while, either find a way to watch it first, or just take my advice and don't bother.  :(
On a separate note, it also came in pretty bad shape, though the mailer was completely fine and barely creased.  The plastic DVD case inside the plastic wrap and sleeve was banged up and just dirty, and the sleeve was much worse.  Be careful if giving as a gift- look it over first.  I am still trying to find where I can report this issue (the second DVD now fulfilled by amazon that has been in bad shape, though the other was much worse and actually broken)- previously I've had no issue with this!",1449187200,4,1417,4.436293436293436

4006529,3,B002WC89WK,"While I think one or two reviews in here really hit the mark, I figured I'd add my own thoughts to help anyone who may be on the fence with what they call the final season of Scrubs.
  The first problem most people encounter is that this really was not a continuation of Scrubs proper, and as I recall when I watched these episodes air when they first came out, it really wasn't intended to be a continuation; it was intended as the start of a spin-off show.  Therefore, do not look into this if you are interested in seeing the main cast from Scrubs because only Dr Cox and Turk are regulars of this show along with hold-over Denise (one of the interns from the last season of Scrubs).  The remaining cast make brief cameos if anything (except JD and Kelso who span a few episodes each).  I personally thought that JD in particular was played-out and they needed to move on especially following the season 8 finale.  Having Cox and Turk as the main authority figures was a smart move as they had already become friends and mentors to others; they make the perfect teachers.
  The new cast is hit and miss.  I cannot stand Cole early on (and through most of this run) and Lucy is too much of an exaggerated actual female JD.  However, Denise and Drew are outstanding and really don't get enough screen time.  Cole does eventually become a 'real boy' but I still find the character irritating.
  Where this show ultimately failed was in a few places:
  1. It held onto the old cast too much and too long.  JD should have been a cameo in the first episode or 2 and then out, otherwise, you take away the chance to establish and grow the new characters.  For my taste, he got far too much screen time and it really wasn't very good or funny most of the time.  JD took a lot away from this series and detracted from the students.
  2. They chose the wrong characters upon which to focus.  Lucy was a poor choice and a glaring attempt to essentially relaunch the original show again with her as the new JD.  Drew and Denise were much more interesting and strengthened the show, either of them would have been a better choice.
  3. Too much recycling of old stories.  Many of the plots are basically the same ones they used in the original Scrubs series and that gets dull in a hurry.
  Why you may still want to see this:
  1. Turk and Dr Cox are both still very good and giving you what you look for from them.
  2. Drew's shady story is interesting and entertaining as it plays out.
  3. The comedic writing was still pretty good and blended well with the serious drama portions.
The bottom line:
  The Med-School episodes deserve about 3.5 stars for the good because they are still amusing even though the focus is on the wrong people part of the time.  It showed some real potential for growth as its own series, but was not given the chance to develop as it tried too hard to hold onto Scrubs rather than spinning off Med-School.  Fans of Scrubs will still like the Med-School shows, but the best parts of Scrubs are in the proper series.  By the time you reach the end, you'll likely be wishing they had the chance to develop some of these characters more, I know I did.",1430784000,,3171,4.348122866894198
4006530,3,B002WC89WK,The product was deliverd on time and in good condition - on this I would rate it a five.  The story or series of the ninth season I would rate it a one or zero.

4006538,4,B002WC89WK,This was the final season for Scrubs and though it was good to have the show for another season the show was just not the same. Only about half of the cast returned and the new university setting was in my opinion not right. The season did have its good points though. The main characters did return with all of the comedy that made me a Scrubs fan to begin with. The new characters were also very good I would have liked to see more of them in another season or a spin off (which in my mind what this season was).

As a long time fan of the show, I was skeptical of this ""final"" season (especially after the absolutely beautiful send off we got in the pervious season. I hate it when I'm right.

The writers seem to have given up. They fall back on familiar story lines and write flat, farcically two-dimensional characters. The ""new"" JD, Lucy, is ridiculous. The writers works so hard to accentuate her quirky personality that she is a caricature. It would have been in the show's best interest to eschew the narrative structure and go with something a little less played out. Or maybe not actually do this season in the first place. That would have been better.

As angry as this entire ensemble makes me, I must say that Denise, the stoic new doctor from the previous season, is actually watchable. She's deadpan, funny, and she makes parts of the show worth watching.

A few (a very few) funny moments aside, save your money. It's not worth it. Scrubs ended at season 8.",1398384000,2,1029,4.60655737704918

I am a big fan of Scrubs and have been since the beginning, so I patiently stuck with this season, and while the first half of the season really didn't seem all that funny or creative, the latter part seemed to hit it's stride right before the plug was pulled for good.

4006575,5,B002WC89WK,"If you're truly a Scrubs fanatic, you will love this season. I read Bill Lawrence fought tooth and nail with the producers to NOT name it Scrubs, but in the end they compromised: They got Scrubs and he got to add Med School to the last frame of the opening sequence, so that people would realize it wasn't the same show, exactly. I don't know if that's the truth, it's just what I read. I love the turn-around that Cole makes, although I was a bit disappointed that the main character, Lucy, was someone I don't care too much about. An obviously better choice would have been Drew/Denise. Honestly, what upsets me the most is the horrible new version of the theme song, performed by WAZ. It's just...really bad. Anyway, all that aside, it's hilarious to me, but too short. Should have been a typical 22-24 episode season.",1328400000,,821,4.554054054054054
4006576,4,B002WC89WK,"This review is based solely on the show and not on the hard copy of the product (DVD).
The ninth season of Scrubs should have been presented as a spin-off.  I would image most of the hostilities towards this season are from viewers that expected a true follow up to season 8.
Based on it's own merit, the show is actually very good.  Some characters were carried over to tie the seasons/series together.  Dr. Cox, Turk and the recently introduced Denise mesh very well with the new cast.  However, J.D., Elliot and Dr. Kelso seemed forced and unnecessary (J.D. was ok to bridge the series, but kind of lingered).
The new cast added something new and refreshing to the series.  I would argue that this was the best route for the writers, for the old characters/stories were getting stale.  Dr. Cox's rants were actually starting to annoy me, J.D.'s daydreams were less funny and more absurd, the whole ""Brain Trust"" was ridiculous, Jordan's paralyzed face frightened me, and the ever increasing use of Ted was irritable.  Even my favorite character, the Janitor, was becoming more of a caricature of a caricature.  It's because of this that I actually enjoyed season 9 more than 8 and the second half of 7.
The dynamics of the new cast include Lucy, a sensitive worry wart (probably my least favorite, but has her moments). Drew, a very capable med student with a blunt personality (works great in tandem with Dr. Cox and Denise).  And my personal favorite, Cole, the self entitled, ego-maniac jerk.
In conclusion, if you are expecting the same repeated antics and characters from the first 8 seasons, you will be disappointed.  If you want something new and refreshing with the heart of the first 8 seasons, you will enjoy.",1325980800,2,1723,4.751677852348993

4006582,4,B002WC89WK,"Rather, this should have been Season 1 of ""Scrubs: Med School"" as far as I am concerned.  And, as I recall, the show was billed as ""Scrubs: Medical School"" when it aired.  Season 8 of Scrubs was clearly the final season - with JD's two-part ""goodbye"" episode (which was really sad for me, in all honesty) being the real Series Finale of the final season of Scrubs.  I admit that this spinoff (yes - let's be honest, that's what it was - with some cast members from the original, just like any spinoff) didn't quite do it for me the way the original show did - but it was the first season, and I think it deserved more of a chance (like more episodes, and a chance at a second season, etc..).  I know I was disappointed when they axed it, regardless of it's ""holding up"" to the original.

ANYONE WHO WAS A TRUE FAN OF THE ORIGINAL WILL FIND PLENTY TO ENJOY FROM THIS SHOW.  re-hashed plots?  Recurring themes?  Blah blah blah...  Every sitcom over the past few decades are using much of ""the same old"" story-lines, themes, plot mechanisms.  The half-hour sitcom ""Grand Story"" has never been done better than Bill Lawrence and crew do it. I just shake my head at some of the whining, complaining folks.  YOU try doing a great, consistently funny, and actually often-meaningful show.  Then, try doing like a COUPLE DOZEN of them, EVERY YEAR, for NEARLY A DECADE.  (Head shaking some more).  Sheesh.  These are the brilliant storytellers of our time, imho.  Yes, of a genre, to be sure; but - stuff's just brilliant.  Season One, Two, Three - these may always be my favorites, but.. I love all of 'em, pretty much.

If you own Scrubs 1 through 8, it'd be a mistake not sporting the mere 17-ish bucks for this, to complete your Scrubs collection.  (Yes, I said it was a spinoff.  It's also the final piece of the Scrubs legacy, and Ken Jenkins and John C. alone make it more-than worth it).",1312848000,2,1885,4.440233236151603
4006583,3,B002WC89WK,"Let me get the big stuff out of the way first. This is NOT Scrubs. This is a spinoff of Scrubs that was marketed as if it was part of the main series. Bill Lawrence should not have allowed that to happened, but that's just my opinion.

That out of the way, the show itself wasn't bad and had it been marketed as the spinoff it really was, I think it could've survived one more season or two. As for this DVD release, I found it lacking when compared to the previous Scrubs seasons. There's no production audio commentary on the actual episodes unlike in seasons 6 through 8. Where there's commentary is in the deleted scenes, to the point you can't hear the dialog in the actual scene! Other bonus features are of weak quality and feel like they were added just for the sake of adding something.

Finally I think I read this from a previous reviewer, but when watching individual episodes, the DVD player freezes at the end, requiring me to eject the disc and put it back in before I can watch another episode.

I am going to echo the thoughts of other reviewers and say that this is not the same Scrubs that we know and love.  This should be a spin off of the original Scrubs called Scrubs: Med School because the link to the rest of the series is thin at best.  They have all new characters and a completey different setting.  I think that if this was a spin off they could have had a pretty good run with the changes, because it would still leave the original characters and overall storyline of the series relatively in tact.  But as far a a final season goes it seems the the show is too forced.  All of that being said I would still recommend buying this as long as you do not look at it as the final season of Scrubs, but as the first season of Scubs: Med School.",1298332800,3,883,4.045977011494253
4006589,4,B002WC89WK,"Sure this isn't the same show that was Scrubs.  Granted it hasn't been marketed that way and instead of being promoted a spin off show in the same vein which Frasier was from Cheers, CSI Miami from original CSI, or even Muppet Babies from the Muppet Show (as referred to in this show).  There in lies the major problem, but that's not this show it self's fault. Probably some penny pinchers in some TV board room wanting to milk as much money from advertisers that insisted on this being called Scrubs Ninth Season. Of course this link ultimately annoyed too many Scrubs fans who didn't watch and the show was axed before a second season (or tenth if you're including Scrubs seasons 1-8).

Scrubs Med School, lets call it what it was supposed to be called, isn't the masterpiece show that Scrubs was, but it's still a good show in its own right.  When it comes down to it, after watching these 13 episodes would you watch another season?  Well I would, and that in my mind means this cast of new actors, did their job. I think there's areas both in casting and script where they could have done better, mostly though that's in clearly separating the two shows (which those same network board members might not have let happen).  The theme song should have been changed rather than a less good version of the original Lazlo Bane's Superman, and they should have gotten rid of hanging the x-ray.  With the opening credits it's also pretty obvious Zach Braff didn't allow his image to be used in episodes he wasn't paid to be in, as Lucy hangs the x-ray in those.  On Zach Braff, his character JD definitely made Scrubs what it was, and was one of the reasons it was so successful, but to be honest, he seems to have no purpose for being on this new show (at the university), his storyline doesn't flow from Season 8 when he left Sacred Heart to be near his kid. That kid is not even mentioned in this one, instead JD's knocked up Elliot and is also married to her, (we don't get to see or find out how any of that happened) This cheap giving into what fans might have wanted for their beloved characters was something writers didn't give into for the real Scrubs show so why do it now?  These new Scrubs episodes grew on me more when JD wasn't in them, as we could then concentrate on the newbie medical students lives and their stories.  JD doesn't have any arch nemesis in the Janitor (no Neil Finn) or Dr Cox (since they're now pretty much equals in this university as is Turk). So we're pretty much reduced to him doing double eagles and low substance stuff like this when he's on screen.  JD would have been better coming in after a few episodes simply visiting Turk or something, rather than writers trying to force his character into a role at the university.

Also the new narrator (Lucy) being pretty much a hybrid between JD and Elliot's characters from Scrubs was a bit annoying not to mention lazy writing.  I also found the actress who played her's makeup covered mole on her upper lip cheek area to be a bit distracting, surely if she was in training to be a doctor she'd get an actual doctor colleague to remove it.

On the plus side, the rich son of major financial contributor, Cole is an interesting and funny shallow self obsessed character.  Drew the repeat and so now mature age student with issues is a great addition to the show and better than any of the newbie characters that appeared in the last couple of Scrubs seasons. The other two study group members the hot Australian student and short Asian student never really reached their potential.  Denise the former and best newbie from season 8 is now a teacher doctor which doesn't really make sense that a trainee could reach these heights this quickly but she is one of the best characters in the new show so a great edition.  She's not as depressed or dark if you will as she was in Scrubs but she's still good entertainment value.  Either her or Drew should have been the narrator to differentiate this show from the JD narrated Scrubs.  Lucy just constantly reminds viewers that it's not Scrubs and brings comparisons.

Maybe the show would have worked better if instead of just building a university on the old Sacred Hearts site, some rich patient whose life was saved could have simply employed Dr Cox, Dr Turk and Denise (maybe also Elliot if she left after a few episodes to have her baby or something) in thanks for saving his life. The cameos by Ted, Dr Kelso and others from the original Scrubs don't really work for being at the university and provide too many links to the old show.  They really needed to make a decision to make this a brand new show, too many attempts to try and win fans of Scrubs by simply having cameos by that shows actors probably ultimately confused to many people to if this was a spin off show or another season of Scrubs without all the characters.

I enjoyed it though, as I said, if they made a second season with this cast I'd have watched it.  Disappointing extra features on the DVD also let this down such as Bill Lawrence appearing on a second TV screen while deleted scenes are playing on another talking the whole time so you can't hear what is being said in the deleted scenes.  There's not many bloopers and Live from The Golf Cart just had two minor characters (security guards) who weren't that good in the show interviewing the Todd about his new book.

Farewell - and so passes the glory that was. Mind you, there are still flashes of wit, and a collection of new med-school students floundering their way through relations personal, medical and scholastic  . . .  but it all seems perfunctory, as if they had just reworked scenes from old scripts. A handful of the old regulars, notably the irascible Dr. Cox and the former sidekick Turk (John C. McGinley and Donald Faison) are still hanging in, but in an enervated fashion, as if they are just going through the motions. Possibly the show might have been workable, if more of the new faces had been introduced and the old ones phased out gradually, but season 9 starts abruptly and then ends even more abruptly. It's as if the plug was pulled between one week and the next. It seems as if the show really ended very satisfactorily at the end of Season 8, but carried on with a few bitter-enders and then lost interest all together after half a season when it became apparent that the lightening could not be caught in the jar once more time.

4006595,4,B002WC89WK,"Look I am sure by now you have heard that Season 9 is not worth your time. Because many of the original characters are not featured as prominently as the first 8 seasons. In fact almost everyone,  except for Turk and Dr. Coxs are gone. With an exception of a few cameos from J.D, Elliot and Bob Kelso, everyone is gone. But here is the real truth about this show, it a great season in its own right. This shows main focus are the interns and their journey of becoming doctors. Keep in mind this season is really a stand alone, unlike seasons 1-8. This in my opinion was the best thing for the show. Zach Braff (J.D) had left the show, along with many others. So the decision to bring in new characters was a breath of fresh air. Please do not misunderstand me. Scrubs is my all time favorite comedy and it as earned that status because of its characters. However, this new cast is great as well. Although some reviews that i have read would make it sound like they are rip offs of J.D and Coxs and guess what, THATS THE POINT!! I will not go into much detail but J.D is a teacher as well as Coxs, Bob and Turk. And one of the ongoing story lines in this season is that they want a intern that resembles them. Which also compliments the fact that the three of them are very narcissistic as the characters themselves admit they are. I mean these new characters are interesting and funny. What's the problem? I will admit the main character (Lucy) is the equivalent female version of J.D. She comes complete with fantasies, problems with DR. Coxs and self confident issues. But these similarities make sense because J.D takes her under his wing for the short time he is featured in this season, because of there similarities. I admit not having the full original cast sucks worst than Hugh Jackman. But the only thing worst than Hugh Jackman, is the winey pathetic wails of fan boys who cant get over change that was very much necessary to continue the show. My only complaint was the final episode of the series. There was no heart or emotion in it what so ever, it just ended like any other normal episode. In short, if you can not embrace this as a stand alone season you will not like it. If you can not embrace change you will not like it.

I think people (even younger people) would have embraced this if it had that name and had been given a season 2. Its really funny. Look at season 1 of scrubs. It doesnt compete with the later seasons as is the case with most tv shows. they have to hit their stride. But the point is I think it would have succeeded as a real spin-off which it really is but ABC forced the creators to use SCRUBs as the title.

Ok so is it good? Yes. Without thinking of the past 8 seasons, is this a good season? Be honest. I think most would answer yes. Its funny. I really like the idea of us being givin the FEMALE version of JD seeing as thats what he became anyway. I really feel that after JD became a father the show was getting lame and the storylines were starting to wear thin and even repeat. So I was actually hoping the creators would do something bold. Well it happened in season 9.

The new Blood mixed with a few old familar faces format works very well.
I think what happened ratings wise is that from the first 10 seconds the show is unrecognizable to old fans what with, sacred heart being torn down, rebuilt and relocated. Eliot somehow being preganant now(I don't remember this happening in season 8). They should have moved a little slower IMO.

My absolute favorite thing about this season is that there is absolutly no CARLA!!!
Aside from them killing nurse roberts in season 6 this has to be my favorite scrubs decision. Carla was so lame!!
another lame thing Im glad they got rid of was the annoying, and really ugly characher of THE GOOCH. GONE!!

Season's 7 and 8 had a few weak moments, but this always happens when a show starts to introduce more characters that take away from the main cast so late into the lifespan of the show.

My problem with this season is that it just isn't necessary in the first place. As I watched the apparent series finale in Season 8, I was filled with rare satisfaction in a shows closing moments. Often I'm let down and it never really reaches the height of what you want, but I think they did such a perfect job stating just enough about why and how these characters mattered to one another so much. The Cox/J.D. moment was perfect for instance. He said what we always wanted to hear him say but quickly recludes back into Coxian form as J.D. opens his mouth one final time. There is a final dilemma for J.D. and a new lesson even on his last day at a place he seems to have gotten almost everything out of it he could, proving his journey is only beginning. I mean, we know what the future holds for him, Turk, Eliot, Carla, etc etc etc and I was just happy to see it go out on a high note.

Then came season 9. I'm not going to say I don't want more Scrubs because I, of course, do. I'm not going to say the character of the interns wasn't a good choice and that I wasn't interested in her, because she did the job. I will say this though. Someone mentioned Saved By The Bell: The New Class and this season felt just like to me. It was an attempt to find ""replacement"" characters to fill roles left empty when previous actors eitehr A) were committed to other things and unable to continue or B) the story itself wrecks the continuity so that these characters couldn't possibly make a return.

To me, the choice of having the hospital get ""knocked down"" and placed on a college campus so that Turk, J.D. and Cox become teachers is just too coincedental. There is no mention of something like this ever potentially occuring, it would have to be a much less desirable position for every one of them who were head's of their departments at Sacred Heart, and it just feels too convenient. Likewise, the show was what it was because I cared about the characters established in season 1 all the way to their stories finale in season 8. This show isn't E.R. and was never a revolving door for stars to play doctors for a few seasons and then move on like a soap opera and that's what made it special. I never really wanted any of the new characters to become the focus, but they were being forced on me.

I really wish they hadn't called this season 9 and had just deemed it something like Scrubs: Med School or something. Overall the laughs are still there but more sparse and they still come from the same cast members, ie Cox, J.D., and Turk. Beyond that, it's just a failed experiment. If you're someone new coming to the show, you can skip this season and still get all you need from seasons 1-8.",1284854400,4,3169,4.294314381270903
4006604,3,B002WC89WK,"After season 8 already had a series finale, the show was just brought back for the heck of it. The writing shows that the original writers probably left too. While a lot of the original cast left as well, there's no Janitor(Neil Flynn), no Carla (Judy Reyes, no Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller) ""not as a regular anyway"" and the stuffed dog isn't even back. Hell J.D (Zach Braff) is only in the first few episodes and is suddenly gone, leaving Turk (Donald Faison) as the lead.

  The show was still funny, but the writing just got lazy. The new students were basically just clones of the originals, which is lame since some of the originals were still on the show. You have Travis Schuldt as Keith, who's just a version of Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) and Kerry Bish as Lucy Bennett, who's a woman version of J.D. She gets lost in her own imagination like he does and the show didn't need 2 people like that.

  Dave Franco is funny and annoying at the same time as Lucy's immature boyfriend Cole. He's at least more refreshing than some of the new cast members, even if I guess you can say he's like the Todd, since the Todd doesn't take his job too seriously either. This season was ok, but I was only a little disappointed it was canceled. I wasn't that mad, since it already had it's series finale last year and most of the life that the show had, left with that series finale.",1283472000,2,1380,4.37109375
4006605,4,B002WC89WK,"I think my biggest and really only problem is that they named this Scrubs season 9 and not season 1 of ""The new Scrubs"" or ""Scrubs: Med School""  This was not the original Scrubs, but would have been a good series in itself.  With a fresh young cast and some of the leftovers from the original I thought this had a good balance of new and old.  I think that bringing the old Scrubs fans into a new spin off show, instead of them hoping they would get another season of their beloved show would have been a much wiser decision, and it may have been renewed if that were the case.  If you are a fan of Scrubs and go into this seeing it as a spin off you will most likely love it.

That quickly changed as I noticed that the writers stayed true to the fun loving nature, while still bringing new material to the table. The ""old"" show had it's time, and it is still hilarious, but it needed new faces and characters to add some life, and that's exactly what it got. The new show is just as good, if not better in some aspects, and while we have to say goodbye to a lot of the quirks and running gags (some of which needed to die ;) we are greeted with new ones. It's hard to not compare it to the old show, but I would say that this season would stand on its own quite well, maybe even better if it didn't have to live up to the standards of those who always want things to stay the same.",1282176000,8,840,4.090909090909091

4006610,3,B002WC89WK,"Upon reading others' reviews of the product, I have also decided to write my own (somewhat biased) review.

This television show suffered from two main problems, the first of these is that it carried on the name ""Scrubs."" This is by far the worst decision ABC could have made regarding this show. In the same way Fraiser, Mork and Mindy, or countless other spin-offs created new titles for themselves while still keeping familiar characters this series needed to do the same. Do NOT buy this product if you are expecting the same brilliance that can be found in the first 8 seasons of this show. It is a different show all together, much as Bill Lawrence wrote on his blog about the show. People expecting the same characters and same relationships as before will find themselves sorely disappointed in the product, much as I am.

The second ""unforgivable sin"" which you will note that many other reviews (both previous and following this one) is the return of the characters and hospital name from the previous seasons. Bottom line is, JD is the heart and sole of all 8 seasons of Scrubs preceding this one. When you remove focus from his character, and the relationships he already established you lose the primary essence of this once great television show.
Adding to this, the relocation of the hospital and the retaining of some characters, though not many, is briefly glossed over in the first episode, in a way that says ""the writers of the show couldn't think of anything"", even an earthquake destroying the old building would have been preferable to the pass-and-glance attitude they give the new setting which, by the way, doesn't fit at all into the reality constructed by the show and completely ruins the suspension of disbelief. (I mean Dr. Cox as friends with JD and Turk? Fundamental conflict just POOF!)

The bottom line is that that old characters and show name needed to be completely removed from the show all-together. As much as I love Dr. Cox's rants, and JD's fantasy sequences, they didn't fit together coherently with the new cast. Oftentimes, what should be a transitional attempt seems like ABC bargaining with Zach Braff to be their TV show posterboy.

While I am sad to see the greatest show of the new millenium disappear from television, I must say I agree when people claim that Scrubs should have ended with Season 8 (in fact, it would've been nice if it had ended as originally planned with a full-lengthy season 7...stupid writer's strike.)

Bill Lawrence once again put out a television show with great potential, however, people should hesitate before deciding to purchase this item.",1280793600,22,2621,4.841517857142857
4006611,1,B002WC89WK,"I watched Scrubs from season 1 and loved every episode of it (ok almost every episode, it went down hill after Lavern died but it did pick up again)

First off, there is absolutely no continuation of the story from season 8. How the hell did Elliot get pregant? When did they get married? Wasn't JD supposed to start at St. Vincents???? Too many questions.

New cast: granted good looking... but that's it, the characters have absolutely no depth.

Feels like when they did one more season of That 70's Show and killed it as well.

SO... here's the scoop, DON'T BUY THIS, just get the first 8 seasons and enjoy scrubs for what it is.",1280620800,20,633,4.431034482758621
4006612,3,B002WC89WK,"It's too bad that this show had to be called Scrubs, because it would have made a relatively good first season of a different show.  And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the Scrubs holdovers were often the worst part of this last season.

Why was this show finally canceled?  Let us count the ways:

1.  In a move that apparently only the staff writers found funny, Zach Braff's J.D. became increasingly vane, stupid, and effeminate to the point of being totally ridiculous.  This change began in season 5 when JD's silliness leaked out of his fantasies and into his normal behavior, when J.D. began truly acting selfishly with regard to his relationships with Elliot (especially) and Turk (occasionally).  This annoyance persisted throughout seasons 6 and 7 as the fantasies got longer and dumber and the stories lost their humanity and realism.  Though the writers sagely brought back the sweet and introspective J.D. for almost all of season 8, we find him back in his worst insecure, jealous, appletini drinking form here in season 9.  He seems to exist only to appease those who tuned in to see Braff's mug.

2.  After slowly softening Dr. Cox and Kelso up for the last 8 years, the writers had no antagonist against whom they could pit these new med students.  In the first seasons, audiences rooted for JD, Elliot, and Turk to hold their own against Kelso, Cox, and Bonnie.  In later seasons, the stories became more about unfolding those once menacing characters and watching JD, Elliot, and Turk grow up.  With all of that out of the way, these new cast members are left without much of a challenge, as no one really finds Cox or Kelso all that scary.  Even the patients, often demanding, uncooperative, or just hillarious in earlier seasons of Scrubs, are mostly just warm bodies this time around.

3.  The choice to focus on Lucy as the new protagonist was an obvious but poor one.  Lucy was written to appeal to audiences in the same way that J.D. had: she is unimpeachably nice, well-intended, and in over her head.  Unfortunately, the scripts magnify Lucy's insecurity and weirdness to such a degree that she never feels like much of a real person.  Her decisions (sleeping with Cole, for example) never seem to make much sense, nor is she terribly sympathetic.  In short, it's hard to root for her because she seems hopeless, stupid, and hollow.  Practically anyone, though especially Drew or Denise, would have made a better lead.

4.  The writers clearly ran out of ideas by this season.  Longtime fans of the show would watch familiar storylines play out in familiar ways.  Echoing Elliot's interactions with Phillip, Denise would be forced to deal with Cole, the rich kid whose well-connected parents make his life easy.  Echoing Elliot's naive belief in the power of a heroin addict to quit, Lucy invests her faith in a hopeless drunk.  Echoing Elliot's stuggle with showing compassion to a young mother, Denise learns to show compassion to a young child.  Over and over again, the same stories repeat with only slight deviation.  Cole's entire character, for the first half of the season, appears to be little more than a less funny version of The Todd.

With all of this said, there are a few high points.

1.  Cole's character does eventually show some humanity and, in doing so, becomes far funnier.  His frequent run-ins with Drew and his inadequate attempts at being a boyfriend to Lucy are some of the few truly laughable one-liners in the season.

2.  Drew, Dr. Cox's new protege, is absolutely the standout member of the cast.  Not only is he incredibly believable as the kind of kid Cox would actually like, but his past as a med school burnout is truly novel.

3.  Turk and Kelso remain true to form and are both hilarious.",1280448000,159,3759,4.751159196290572
4006613,4,B002WC89WK,"To me, there are few things that are more annoying than people stubbornly clinging to an idealized version of a TV show, movie or band. You hear it all the time: ""man, their first album was amazing, but everything else sucked"" or ""why can't it be like the first two seasons?!"" Often these opinions are informed by sheer narrow-mindedness and an inability go appreciate the growth and evolution that takes place during the course of any artistic lifespan. Certainly, a later album may not be as inspired as an earlier one, or a later season may not have the per-episode brilliance that it once had during it's early days... but this is not an excuse to shut your eyes and ears to a product that can often make up what it lacks in freshness with tonal consistency, emotional progression and natural evolution. That's not to say that a season or album is always acceptable. There is simply no excusing lazy writing and tired approaches.

So, where does Scrubs season 9 fit into all of this? Honestly, a little of both. Starting with the bad: Zach Braff should not be here. He dominates the first five episodes in which he appears, but not in a good way. No doubt, Bill Lawrence and ABC thought Braff would serve as a good transitional cog, a segue between the old Scrubs and the new cast. It sounds good on paper. But the fact is that this is not J.D. Sure, it looks like him... but no. This is some bizarre, hollow zombie-like reincarnation of a once multifaceted character. He is reduced solely to bercamp antics, and his presence in the new med school is never really explained. Sure, J.D.'s camp was part of the fun... when he had other levels through which to connect to the viewer. That's not the case here. This is pure, unforgivable self-parody. Yes, we get it. It's funny to exhibit stereotypically ""gay"" traits but really be straight. Ho freaking ho. This is redundant comedy moving backwards in an increasingly progressive and creatively rich era of television. Further, his existence as a teaching doctor is totally unrealistic. He functions only to leech on the audience's fond memories of his early days, defiling the corpse of his character with every ham-fisted camera mug. With Braff on board as an executive producer, coupled with his notoriously lofty self image, the blame can only he attributed to him. He is almost single-handedly responsible for the failings of season 9.

Certain other things don't work either. The two new security guards, presumably there to replace Janitor, are just terrible. Unwatchable. Lucy, the med student who is effectively J.D. 2.0 is played as too 'zany' to be a sympathetic and approachable character for the viewers. Where Braff was initially charmingly self-absorbed and detatched, Lucy is just selfish and obsessed. The show has gotten to the point where all the characters are strong enough that we don't need a superfluous anchor for us to relate to. Picking Lucy to fill in Braff's position was a mistake, as we can't help but compare the two, which is unfair but unavoidable.

Before I get on to the other new characters though, let's talk about the other returning faces. Cox is back, playing the same role he has for the last 5 seasons at least - that is, the camera-hogging, self-righteous alpha who increasingly shows his more approachable side. Love it or hate it (or just tolerate it, like me), he gives it his all, and never feels out of place. This goes for Turk too. Once unleashed from the trainwreck of zombie J.D.(and also Carla - unlike another reviewer, I thought their relationship put a severe dampener on Donald Faison's character) he really comes into his own, taking on a slightly more empathetic role as the 'relatable' senior character. Making a return in Eliza Coupe as Denise, the cynical intern turned resident. She's one of the major forces in this season, and thankfully owns her increased screentime. Coupe is one of the major reasons I'm crushed that there won't be a season 10. Various other chracters have returning roles - Kelso pops up sometimes with little explanation, but I never liked him anyway, so that didn't affect me. Elliott is there for a while, and is still played brilliantly by Chalke, even if her charater is a bit tired. Todd becomes even more of a parody, but is in it too little to complain. Minor stars like Sunny make welcome reappearanes too.

OK, so onto the other new characters. Firstly, Michael Mosley as the sarcastic Drew is nothing but amazing. The amount of life he breathes into the show is off the charts. I get hints of Adam Baldwin from Chuck and Will Arnett from him - maybe even a little of James Roday from Psych - but really he is his own character, and makes the season unmissable. It is a crying shame that we won't get a chance to see his evolution as a character. The other big new star is Cole, played unmistakably by a Franco. At first his one-trick schtick is a bit hard to take, but as the season progresses, you realise that he's sort of like Todd - just there for laughs. And there are laughs. Particularly his faceplant in YouTube video. You'll see what I mean.

As for the writing, there are a few poor decisions (more than simply the pillaging of J.D.) - the med school set up could do with some more solid foundations, and the campus environment never really comes across. The patient stories are mostly more of the same - poor attempts at warming our hearts - and the first episode in particular, being also the most crucial, was a disaster. Still, most of the flaws can be attributed to the attempts to surgically graft Scrubs into a different environment. The new situations for the new characters are generally pretty funny, and a few of the pairings - Drew and Denise in particular - are actually pretty sweet. I believe that if Lawrence had gotten his way, this would have been more removed from the stigma of Scrubs (I can't stress enough the destructive force that Braff has here) and this probably would have been enough for another season.

So there you have it. A review of a pretty great season of a TV show that shares some core DNA with Scrubs, but also stands very well on its own. Certainly it was more consistently funny than the previous two seasons. Personally I'm pretty upset that it won't be coming back - that's a real disservice to the hard work that the writers and actors put into the fresh elements of this season. Unfortunately they were the victim of some very poor (probably network-mandated) decisions. Surely, given time, this would have become an overwhelmingly competent show, as, towards the end. it had enough fresh talent and just the right amount of the old Scrubs feel. It wouldn't be hard to imagine it being renewed if it wasn't carrying the unquestionably heavy load of being a ""ninth season."" Sad to see it go.
