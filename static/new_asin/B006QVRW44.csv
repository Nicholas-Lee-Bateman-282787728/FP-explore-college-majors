5013969,5,B006QVRW44,"The follow on DVD to volume 1 ( see my review )brings nuance and depth to the offerings in volume 1. Volume 1 is a fantastic primer. Volume 2 is the natural progression for those who seek a higher level of playing and understanding of this instrument. Inversions and progressions up the neck with exploration of swing, jazz and blues are where volume 2 will take you. Bob encourages the viewer to expand and explore various keys and techniques to create more fluency and sophistication in their playing. The set of DVDs , while not being a "" learning through playing a dozen songs"" approach, will equip the viewer to be able to apply these principles to play hundreds of songs with much more than three chords. Completing these DVDs IMO leaves one the ability to create their own ukulele ""ear candy'. Enjoy!",1353888000,6,807,4.65034965034965
8503299,5,B006QVRW44,This is the most helpful teaching tool I have found for the Ukulele.  Bob knows what he is talking about and explains it in a easy way to understand.  I true beginner on the ukulele can understand and start to play along with the first lesson.  Everything from tuning to playing the ukulele is extremely well done.  Great job Mr. Brozman.,1477612800,,338,4.491803278688525
8503300,5,B006QVRW44,"The perfect sequel.
I can see me spending the rest of my life learning from these two stunning educational triumplhs.
This guy now his stuff and these dvd work onso many levels.
I like my Bert Casey dv but his is just beautiful inspirational anad loaded with knohow and history pluas some amazing figer work broken down so it no longer is a mystery.",1429228800,,349,4.46875
8503301,3,B006QVRW44,"He's a good teacher, but I thought the skill level would be higher.  I wanted to add new techniques to my playing, but this didn't really do it for me.  Sorry",1422748800,,158,4.064516129032258
8503302,5,B006QVRW44,Bob Brozman provides hours of essential instruct of the ukulele. Each segment of the disks is a lesson to be digested carefully and practiced rigorously. What bargain! Brozman as your instructor and for only about $20 a disk instead of $20 a half hour for lessons that you get at the local music store. Buy these disks if you want to improve your uke playing!,1402876800,3,359,4.538461538461538
8503303,5,B006QVRW44,Brozman was a genius. He really lived and breathed music. It seem as easy as breathing for him. I highly recommend this DVD not only for ukulele players but for musicians in general.,1397088000,,182,4.545454545454546
8503304,5,B006QVRW44,"Brozman's teaching style is straight forward, uncomplicated, and gentle! The world is a lonely place without him in it, now.",1396915200,,124,5.25
8503305,4,B006QVRW44,Great techniques but moves a little too quickly.  Wish he would have spent more time explaining each technique and how/when it can be used.,1392508800,,139,4.791666666666667
8503306,4,B006QVRW44,"I like how Bob shows us how to use our Thumb with the index and middle finger to do triplets. He does should different strumming techniques with different timing and styles of music.  He also shows us how to move up the frets and back down using chords and thinking about finger patterns on our left hand making the chords as we move up the frets.  Also, he goes over how the slants work on the fret board going up the scale.",1388102400,2,425,4.170731707317073
8503307,5,B006QVRW44,"In order to get the most out of this DVD, having some music theory,chordal knowlege & keyboard positioning recognition all the way up the neck, will be very beneficial in understanding what it happening. I replay parts from time to time just like it was intended for, a ""tool box."" There are a couple chapters loaded with techniques to mske you a more knowlegable player.",1368230400,5,371,4.723076923076923
8503308,4,B006QVRW44,"This is an excellent video which includes music theory, advanced strumming, and fingerpicking, etc. Although I learned a lot, this is too advanced for me. I ordered Level #2 because I thought Level 1 would be too easy, i.e. learning parts of a uke, a few chords, simple strums, etc. I have only been playing a few months. If you are an advanced uke player this video will be helpful. It is not for beginners.",1362096000,5,408,4.453333333333333
