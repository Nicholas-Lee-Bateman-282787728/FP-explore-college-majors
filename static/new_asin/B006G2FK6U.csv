Free Men observes the 2nd World War through a unique but optimistic lens, highlighting the solidarity between Arabs and Jews. The acting is great, especially with Tahar Rahim's stunning performance, and the music adds to the intelligence and sensibility of the film. I highly recommend Free Men to viewers who enjoy great acting and an unconventional story.",1338940800,5,434,5.041666666666667
4985676,5,B006G2FK6U,"We've all seen World War II films, heard about the war and the Holocaust, read the history books, but what Free Men is, is unique.  It's an adapted version of true events about the people who turned around to help Jews during the war, and in German-occupied Paris.  It gives credit to those who stuck their necks out to fight for freedom despite religion, culture, and the danger of it all.  It's a testament to humanity, where director Ismal Ferroukhi really put his best foot forward, and then ran a mile.  And you have to watch Tahar Rahim give such a strong performance.

It's culturally interesting and gets your heart going in more ways than one.",1333584000,6,652,4.586206896551724
4985677,5,B006G2FK6U,"This was all new to me, but I absolutely loved all the unexpected situations presented. Tahar Rahim is very good in the lead role, the music is lovely, and the script is tight and tense. I thought the look the two actors gave each other at the end of the film spoke a thousand words, and that in itself was a powerful, incredible, unexpected moment. I am not going to give away any of the plot elements because they all surprised me, and I liked the surprises. Loved this film.",1382313600,,477,4.311111111111111
4985678,4,B006G2FK6U,"Is it possible? In the 20th century, the best singer of the Arab world was really Jewish and homosexual?  Yes. And not only that...he survived Nazi persecution because of the aid of a Muslim religious Imam of the Paris Mosque - Si Kaddour Benghabrit.

This is but one of the story threads of a movie focused on the assistance offered North African Jewish refugees by the Paris Mosque during World War II, defying the Nazis and bringing these two groups together.  In my view, with the renewed possibility of peace between Palestine and Israel, it is valuable to learn that these two groups should, indeed must learn to live like brothers again.

Most of the movie centers around a young Arab man, interested in making money in the black market of Paris, who develops a conscience in his encounter with Salim Halali, the singer I began this post talking about.  It is not a perfect film - think of it as an Arab/Jew version of Fascist Resistance in the mode of Rosselini's Italian Neorealist classic - ""Rome - Open City.""

Don't let me forget to say that Arab music permeates just about every frame of this film - and that is the best part for lovers of this genre.  I own the vinyl record ""Salim Halalai - En arabe LP"" and experiencing the true voice of this artist is a thrilling music adventure.

Recommended.",1376524800,,1311,4.572649572649572
4985679,3,B006G2FK6U,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of Film Movement's library of foreign and indie movies, so much so that I finally gave in last year and became a member of their DVD-of-the-Month club. But I am still catching up on some older releases, including this one (January '12 DVD-of-the-Month release).

""Free Men"" (2011 release from France; 99 min.) starts off by informing us that the influx of North African immigrants, specially from Morroco and Algeria, into France, and Paris, in particular, came to a stop when WWII broke out in 1939. As the movie opens, we get to know Younes, a young man from Algeria who tries to make ends meet in Nazi-occupied Paris by selling stuff (coffee, cigarettes, etc.) on the black market. Alas, he gets caught by the Paris police and the police chief strikes a deal with Younes: to hang out at the local mosque and see who comes and goes, while keeping the police chief informed. Younes gets to know, and eventually befriends, Salim, another young guy who is making a name for himself as a singer. Younes eventually discovers Salim is Jewish, and now Younes finds himself in a complicated situation: will he inform the police chief of this? or will he instead protect Salim? At this point we are a good one-third into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience.

Several comments: first, before the movie even starts, we are informed that this story is based on ""true events"" but with fictionalized characters. Which is sort of like having your cake and eating it too: you claim to bring ""the truth"" yet it is impossible to verify or accept as such, since it is an adapted truth with made-up characters. Second, while the movie brings an interesting slice of life from Nazi-occupied Paris, I nevertheless could never fully embrace the movie, for a couple of reasons: (i) it's probably just me but the movie feels more like theatre than a movie (check out for example the scenes in the mosque, as if straight out of Masterpiece Theatre), and (ii) some of the performances come across as wooden and/or aloof (I can just see the director yelling ""action!"" before Tahar Rahim (in the role of Younes) lights up a cigarette and is sitting in a smokey lounge somewhere). This powerful story is really not helped by those shortcomings. Bottom line: this is of course not a bad movie per se (as compared to your standard Hollywood fare), but neither is it one of the stronger releases in the rich Film Movement catalog. In other words, in this instance it feels like Film Movement is a victim of its own success!",1373328000,,2563,4.643171806167401
4985680,5,B006G2FK6U,"I first saw this movie at a film festival last year and just knew I had to get it. The plot is engaging and fantastic, the characters are all well-developed, and all of the actors are very subtle in their mannerisms. I highly suggest getting this movie if you like historical fiction.",1361577600,,284,4.480769230769231
4985681,5,B006G2FK6U,"I knew nothing of the activities of this group of people in France during WWII so this was revelatory to me.  The beginning scenes, especially, in the mosque and in the cabaret were a wonderful glimpse of another culture.  The mosque, especially, was lovely.

It's mostly a character driven story about a young Algerian immigrant man who is profiteering by selling goods on the black market soley to make money for himself and his family and to return home rich.  Then he inadvertently becomes involved in the French resistence.  It's a fascinating story and allegedly based on true people and events.

I'm not a big fan of camera work and rarely even notice it and never comment on it.  But I have to say that it did get my attention here and I loved it.  Neither am I a fan of car chases or shoot outs but this one, instead of making me cringe and withdraw, drew me in.  I particularly wondered at the dawn (or was it dusk) scene at the Seine, where a group of people escaped onto a barge.  It was pure poetry.

I have to mention the music, too.  Again, I've never been a fan of Arabic music but this was really enjoyable.  I loved the man who played the Salim, the Arab-Jewish singer.  He was magnetic in his personal style and his vocal intensity.  His presence was an important aesthetic element to the film.

In sum...I think I need to change my initial rating from four stars to five.",1357776000,2,1391,4.417322834645669
4985682,5,B006G2FK6U,I really like this actor and the story is a new one for me. I never thought of the Muslims in France as being present during this war. I highly recommend it for the classroom in French.,1353628800,,185,4.027027027027027
4985683,4,B006G2FK6U,"Ismal Ferroukhi both wrote (with Alain-Michel Blanc) and directed this emotionally charged story based on fact and peppered with real and fictitious characters to drive home the point of the film - that differences among peoples become erased in response to a common enemy. This is a powerful little film made more radiant because of the brilliant cast.

In German occupied Paris in WW II there is a segment of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants who survive on the fringes largely due to people like the unemployed Younes (the handsome and gifted French actor of Algerian origin Tahir Rahim) who runs a black market selling cigarettes, tea, coffee and food to his fellow Algerians - until he is caught by the police. Instead to going to prison he is set up to spy on the Paris Mosque, thought by the police to be center for the Mosque authorities, including its rector Ben Ghabrit (Michael Lonsdale) of aiding Muslim Resistance agents and helping North African Jews by giving them false certificates. At the Mosque, Younes meets the Algerian singer Salim Halali (Mahmud Shalaby), and is moved by Salim's beautiful voice and strong personality. When Younes discovers that Salim is Jewish, he stops collaborating with the police and gradually transforms from a politically ignorant immigrant black marketeer into a fully-fledged freedom fighter. It is this friendship between Younes and Salim that shapes the changes in Younes character, allowing him to move form a non-political opportunist to a committed freedom fighter.

There are many side stories that occur - the influence of the Gestapo, the presence of the mysterious Leila (the profoundly gifted and beautiful Lubna Azabal), Vichy collaborators, Muslims, Jews, Christians, resistance fighters, communists, spies, snitches, fugitives, traitors, criminals, children and innocents - with the theme of discovered camaraderie emerging slowly but surely. This is an inspired film that opens windows to parts of WW II history little known to the general public, and at films end the history of the post war activities of those character who are real is revealed, with `Younes' being described as the general representative of all the Algerian and Jewish immigrants.  The score is filled with the singing of Salim/Mahmud Shalaby that adds a definite feeling of authenticity to the film.  In French and Arabic with English subtitles.

4985684,2,B006G2FK6U,"Tahar Rahim plays Younes, a young Algerian in Paris during the Nazi occupation, planning to return to Algeria after he gets rich on the black market. Instead, he ends up joining the Resistance and helping a few Jews escape through the Paris mosque.

Rahim is a gifted actor. I first saw him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Prophet/dp/B002BWP3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Prophet</a>, a so-so prison movie in which he gave a fantastic performance. Free Men has a great performance by Michael Lonsdale as the head of the mosque, and maybe that's why Rahim seems less impressive in this movie than he was in A Prophet. A Prophet made me an instant fan, but if I'd seen Free Men first I don't think that would have happened; Rahim is good in it, but not fantastic.

Another problem I have with Free Men is that the central relationship is between Younes and a young Jewish singer of North African music named Salim who has survived because the mosque gave him false ID as a Moslem. The friendship between Younes and Salim is supposed to be inspiring (I think), but it just annoyed the hell out of me.

First, the actor who plays Salim is an Arab, not a Jew, and he looks like an Arab, not a Jew. Trying to see the character as a Jew is practically impossible, but his Jewishness is key to the movie. If their friendship is supposed to exemplify some sort of grand utopian harmony between Arabs and Jews, it fails.

Second, Salim is supposed to be the world's greatest singer of North African music, but to me it was nearly unbearable, just a bunch of ugly, whiny, screechy, nasal noise. I don't mean to offend North Africans, but their music doesn't sound like music to me (Lots of American music is even worse, though, including punk, heavy metal and rap).

Plus, the guy playing Salim is so ugly that I couldn't look at him for more than a few seconds at a time; he has weird eyes that reminded me of the Emperor's yellow eyes in The Empire Strikes Back (or maybe it was Return of the Jedi), only Salim's are a strange unnatural blue color. Better casting of that role might have helped this movie a lot.

So I don't recommend Free Men. The only things I enjoyed were Lonsdale's performance and seeing a sort of street-level view of what Paris may have been like under the Nazis, which I don't think I'd ever seen before.",1350691200,,2370,4.685096153846154
4985685,4,B006G2FK6U,"This is the story of Younes (Tahir Rahim -`A Prophet') he plays a small time Algerian, black marketer in German occupied Paris circa 1942. He gets caught by the collaborationist French Gendarmes and in return for not being jailed (or worse) is told he has to spy on the Paris Mosque. The authorities believe it is being used as a centre to protect `undesirables' and for giving out false documents to aid people fleeing the Nazi rule. At the mosque he meets a talented Arabic singer Salim Halali (Mahumud Shalaby), and Younes is moved by his singing and forceful personality so starts to view his world with very differently.

He also gets involved in helping those he had once lived off /exploited, as he becomes more aware of the plight of those who are being persecuted, he turns from being a self centred, money making merchant into a committed `freedom fighter'. The mosque is central to the whole thing and the leader there is played by Michael Lonsdale (`Of Gods and Men' and `Ronin') who as ever delivers an impeccable performance.

This film shows a remarkable part of history where the Muslims helped Jews escape the Nazi tyranny and as such should be praised for highlighting such a story, but it has got some critics, despite doing rather well on `Rotten Tomatoes' there are still some valid criticisms, one being the lack of tension. That could be because a lot of what takes place is ordinary every day life at the mosque, or the little on screen time of the Nazis and their ally Gendarmes'. This is much more character driven than action and that too could explain it being called `shapeless and sluggish- (The Daily Telegraph). I thought it was a quietly moving story that was directed extremely well by Ismal Ferroukhi. The sets are all wonderful and full of colour especially the Mosque; some of the German uniforms I felt were a bit ropey but that is a minor gripe.

Overall this is one for those who like a bit of art in their films and is in French with fairly good sub titles, a quick search showed that a lot of what is featured in the film did actually take place, and is something I knew nothing at all about, not for action fans and not a real `war' movie for purists but a commendable effort all the same.",1348790400,2,2232,4.54726368159204
4985686,4,B006G2FK6U,"This wartime French-language drama freely mixes actual people and events with a fictional narrative, about Younes, a young Algerian man scratching a living in Nazi-occupied Paris. Free Men follows a conventional narrative, exploring Younes' rite of passage from nave, self-interested youth towards a manhood honed by the relentless impact of the Gestapo jackboot on the people around him.
Initially he looks out only for himself and his immediate family, not hesitating to trade on the black market and take advantage of any deal, at the expense of anyone else including penniless compatriots. When first pressed by the Vichy police to spy at the local mosque his reticence isn't on moral grounds - his discomfort stems from his lack of experience and fear of being caught. At the start of the film, Younes would apparently sell anyone to save his own skin. By the end of it he is ... different. He finds a cause to defend, sometimes running the ultimate risk and taking the ultimate action.

Interwoven with the main plot are many other intriguing threads and characters; Vichy collaborators, Nazi officers, Muslims, Jews, Christians, spivs, resistance fighters, communists, spies, snitches, fugitives, traitors, criminals, children and innocents - with the theme of discovered brotherhood at the film's core. We're left to wonder if the Imam and rector are helping Jews to escape (by providing them with false identities as Muslims) simply because it is the right thing to do... or if they have one eye on a postwar future in which Algeria would want to claim its independence from France.
That's part of what makes Free Men so satisfying. It's beautifully filmed, evoking a more normal depiction of wartime Paris than the stereotype we see so often; it's obviously an occupied city with arrests and martial law, but it's also one where people go about their lives, adapting to the strange circumstances of the time. The colours are human - not a wash of grey misery - the events are commonplace, and affirm that even when the most appalling horrors of history are going on, people still have birthdays, still go to the mosque, still dance, still wash clothes... still form connections.
So Free Men works on many levels. It's both an intelligent, fulfilling story in its own right and a window onto an unfamiliar political situation which is extremely relevant today, in the aftermath of the Arab spring.
And the music! The soundtrack is integral to the film's themes and takes centrestage on a couple of occasions, but it never overwhelms the conventional action. It perfectly highlights Younes' early isolation... and then gradually he's drawn into a foot-tapping, head-nodding rhythm along with his compatriots. The beauty of the Arabic vocals are wonderfully underplayed; at times the translated lyric is stunningly banal, but the sound almost angelic.

Free Men is, then, an unusually accessible arthouse / foreign language film, with themes we can easily relate to - but with plenty of meat in each scene to muse on for days to come. At its heart it is an optimistic, uplifting film which chooses to concentrate on the aspects of goodness emerge even at times of the greatest evil.
Not a typical war movie, it reminds us that an act of heroism can be something as simple as walking the streets of Paris during daylight to take two small children to safety.
Bravo.

He has a quiet magnetism that lends itself perfectly to rich, three-dimensional characters that feel very human and you can discover little by little. This time he lends his talent to the character of an Algerian immigrant to France during WWII caught up between his own well-being and that of others; and who tries to understand where his loyalty and heart should be. Its a compelling and engaging plot, quite different from usual war films, filled with amazing characters and interesting stories.

8497350,4,B006G2FK6U,"Taking place in Nazi occupied Paris in WWII, the Algerian film Free Men an astounding coming of age story of a young Algerian Muslim petty criminal transformation from a selfish survivor into a heroic resistance fighter...a well worth journey watching.

What's astounding about this film and a great revelation it is that in total contrast to the violence and hatred existing between two great people, Jews and Muslims who for 400 years co-existed in Spain and are now killing each other thanks to Western business interests seeking to keep them apart, this film which is inspired by true events tells a different story, a time when Muslim and Jew were brothers fighting common enemies, Nazis and their brutal French Vichy allies.

Caught by the French Vichy Police, our petty criminal Younes is given a choice, be thrown into prison where he will be tortured and is likely to die, or spy on the local mosque Imam suspected of helping Jews and Communists escape.

Observing who comes and who goes, befriending Salim Halali, a young Algerian-Jewish singer (who later gained fame in France), falling in love with an Algerian woman, Younes learns that the imam indeed is helping Jews escape, saving Halali's life, but failing to save the Algerian woman he had fallen in love with, a Communist murdered by the Nazis. The heartbreak changes Younes.

A wonderful, suspenseful film giving one hope that perhaps there will come a day when Jew & Muslim can be at peace again.",1390176000,3,1466,4.899193548387097
