5891745,5,B00E5QTVT6,"I can assure you it has EVERY single bonus discs, photos, memos, original posters and 40 pagesBook.

I guess James dean is not a star in England so the same boxset is less expensive.

I paid around 30 bucks shipped.

IN FACT THE FILMAKERS JOURNEY disc is not included but everything else is so make your choice.

The transfers are very good and 5.1 dts hd  is very clear, i'm watching Rebel tonight !

By the way the screen tests from rebel are there",1383177600,3,450,4.2976190476190474
5891746,3,B00E5QTVT6,"I purchased my ""James Dean - Ultimate Collector's Edition [Blu-ray] [1955] [Region Free]""
 from Amazon UK and it arrived today. Three of the discs are region 2 and will NOT play in US blu ray players. I wouldn't recommend getting this version if you live in the USA.

The blu ray quality of ""East of Eden"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" were rather good. ""Giant"" was a bit of a disappointment.

I did received a total refund from Amazon UK. I have bought several region free blu rays from them and have always been pleased...but, not this time. It's normally a great way to save cash or get a title that hasn't yet been released in the USA.",1383177600,14,637,4.38135593220339

Best to get the US release if you want the complete package.",1379980800,38,327,4.35
5891748,4,B00E5QTVT6,"This 7-disc collection (BD&DVD) includes 3 films: East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. The highlight of this collector's edition is 3 different feature-length documentaries (each getting their own DVD). Collectibles include: A 40-page commemorative book, 3 mini reproductions of the original theatrical movie posters, authentic production memos from East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause, and behind-the-scenes photos. There is roughly 8 hours of total bonus content included. Unfortunately, the picture and audio quality are only marginally better than the DVD releases so fans may not want to upgrade especially if they have already seen the documentaries. Some have complained Giant lacks the same level of sharpness as the other films. True, it is soft (but also identical to the stand-alone Blu-ray) because the film was originally shot at 1.66:1 which doesn't project as distinctly as many people expect.

5891749,5,B00E5QTVT6,"I to just ordered from Amazon UK which clearly says it is REGION FREE.
Granted any dvd content will probably need a REGION FREE PLAYER (DVD) but that's ok, because I have one.
The extras like the book appear to be the same AND IN A SMALLER BOX!

As pointed out by Seb: While looking at the inset on both websites, it appears that all the contents (extras) are the same (postcards, book, posters). So, if you're looking to save a few dollars, check out the UK website. And yeah, all three movies are same: Giant, Rebel and East.",1375401600,51,559,4.333333333333333
5891752,3,B00E5QTVT6,"With Dean I am chiefly a fan of East of Eden, but I was tempted by the word ""Ultimate"" here to get the entire package. Sure enough, the extra goodies such as movie stills and souvenir book are as promised. However, I naively thought that all of the movies would be not only Blu-Ray but digitally remastered, so I was very unhappy with the grainy look and general quality of Giant. I hope I will live to see the day when East of Eden gets the same restoration treatment as Lawrence of Arabia, but it might not happen. Considering that I was a fan of this movie for 3 or 4 decades before I ever saw the proper wide screen version, and this is the best East of Eden I've seen to date,  I'm still pretty happy with that portion of the package.",1386460800,3,739,4.1678321678321675
5891753,5,B00E5QTVT6,"Sammy Davis Jr. put it best... James Dean ""was simply the greatest screen experience of all time""...
If you have a high quality TV, you will see these films like NEVER before.  The faded, washed out colors are now rich & vibrant.
It's like seeing the movies and experiencing the magic for the 1st time...yet better than ever.  Nothing is perfect - but this version is a
""no doubt about it""  improvement.
Have seen all of the the movies dozens of times....and find the vibrancy of color a clear departure from what the eye is used to seeing.
It is striking.  Given the age of the films, it is a beautiful upgrade from the older versions of VHS / BETA / & original DVD versions.
If you're a Dean fan...and if you have a high quality TV- I would recommend highly...",1386374400,4,762,4.382978723404255
5891754,1,B00E5QTVT6,"A major disappointment ""East of Eden"", "" Rebel without a Cause"" look no better than the DVD versions. ""Giant"" looks terrible, I think it looks more like a VHS then BD. What  was Warners thinking in producing this sub-standard Blu Ray version, They should be recalled and done correctly.",1386201600,5,286,4.836734693877551

5891756,5,B00E5QTVT6,"I bought this box set primarily for the blue Ray of 'Giant' but I found that 'East of Eden' and 'Rebel Without a Cause' had a better picture and 5.1 sound mix where as 'Giant' was a bit grainy and the mix was only stereo.
All and all I loved the box set and all of the extras. It's fairly inclusive although I did not see the piece that he did with Gig Young about driving.",1385596800,,373,3.9210526315789473
5891757,2,B00E5QTVT6,"This is a very disappointing release.  All three films were major studio productions - widescreen, color etc. They are the type of film that actually REQUIRE the extra clarity and brightness of Blu-ray.  But they get neither here.  EAST OF EDEN looks the best, but an A/B comparison of a number of scenes showed no significant improvement over the old DVD.  REBEL lacks clarity in most scenes and no amount of TV adjustment will get you vivid color or natural flesh tones.  GIANT is a near disaster.  The whole film is blurry and the colors are way off.  You would have to go back to the early days of VHS for quality comparisons.  I read somewhere that they did a 4K scan for this release, but something basic was really wrong.  Many recent HD releases  have been from originals where the colors have faded, but with careful digital color correction, the results are spectacular.  MY FAIR LADY is a good example.

REBEL mentions a ""restoration"" in the final credits, but there is no evidence of any such thing.  The issue here is not merely of consumer disappointment.  Is Warner implying that this is the best these films will ever look?  Is this the way they will exist for future generations?  I sense a real disrespect for their own important film holdings in quest of the quick buck.

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  Following recommendations in this review section, I purchased the UK issue of this set.  Although the feature BDs play fine, none of the three additional discs would play on either of two Blu-ray players.  They seem to be Region B specific.",1384905600,7,1551,4.6531365313653135
5891758,3,B00E5QTVT6,"I agree with previous reviewer RICHARDSON.  I am a HUGE James Dean fan BUT disappointed greatly with this packaging.  I have only had a chance to view REBEL so far, which does look great BUT the layout on this packaging is far from great...  They don't even have the content of the discs listed anywhere.  The book is thrown together haphazardly with lots of very common pictures, all in black and white.  There are so many things that could have been in here, that look really cool BUT it appears that whoever laid this out was far from a fan of Dean's work.  The reproduction posters are dark and lack detail.  The 8 x 10's are nice BUT not worth spending the $ for.  James Dean deserves much better than this.  The covers on the original DVD releases were much better.",1383782400,2,771,4.411347517730497
5891759,1,B00E5QTVT6,"Extremely disappointed in the picture quality which is no better than the DVD versions.  I see no
improvement and I do not believe any restoration was done.  It is not Blue-ray quality, period.
I got the UK version and according to another reviewer, the U.S. version is the same.  People need
to raise their voices and get this problem corrected. Shame to Warner to market such a bad product.

So what is the complaint?  Giant is the worse of the three.  It is fuzzy, out of focus (soft) with no contrast
in the bright outdoor scenes so the colors are washed out.  The night scenes are too dark with no shadow detail
and look blotchy.  There is a blue halo outline in some scenes and I don't know the cause of it.

East of Eden DVD was a good transfer to begin with but I do not see any improvement with the Blue-ray.
Even the titles are slightly soft!  All three films suffer from shoddy quick transfers from DVD master to
Blue-ray without restoring them to their original pristine quality.",1383782400,10,991,4.455555555555556
5891760,3,B00E5QTVT6,"I am writing as an OWNER of the set, purchased today at Costco for 69.99.  I am reviewing the contents and presentation NOT the classic and trend making films contained within I'd rate them all 5 stars for various reasons.

 I am considering returning it for these reasons...
ONLY the three films and  the new 10 minute featurette with Dennis Hopper are BR
the FOUR other DVDs are the same ones I already own , James Dean : Sense Memories, James Dean Forever Young and George Stevens a filmaker's journey....  as well as the bonus DVD disc from the movie GIANT in standard def... so four of the seven discs are repeats for me without any upgrade content or quality.... NOW for the movies

like my title says, GIANT looks terrible... and that was my biggest shock. George Stevens began as a cameraman and his films are stunning normally from a visual standpoint and GIANT has that reputation.  I can't see any improvement over the DVD and in fact in some areas I think it looks worse?  Its format of 1:66 is almost full widescreen and I was really looking forward to the Texas vistas etc but find it blotchy , blocked up .. dull, and soft.  Rebel Without A Cause is again not any substantial improvement over the excellent DVD already available and while East Of Eden is the oldest film , it is easily the best looking of the bunch but again , not a startling improvement over the existing fine DVD.

The bonus book is a one time flip through and the little packet of photos is more filler and fluff intended to make this box set resemble something collectible.  In retrospect I think I'd have rather bought the individual films on BR that they had for sale.... I believe it would have come to a bit less price and I wouldn't have this big box to try and find a place for...

Bottom line, if you have the former excellent WB James Dean box set you will be spending from 70 to 100 bucks for a very very minimal upgrade and for me after months of anticipation a big disappointment.",1383609600,41,1978,4.403846153846154
5891761,4,B00E5QTVT6,"Bought the UK edition,  the three blu ray feature films look great and play region free.  The supplemental discs do not play on region one (USA) players.  If I were you, I'd just wait for a couple of months and buy US edition at a later reduced price.

8601596,2,B00E5QTVT6,"When I purchased the James Dean Ultimate Collectors Edition (Blu-ray) (on sale for $56.99), I thought I was getting a good deal - that is until I played Giant.

In the optional introduction, there is the claim that the film was restored just like George Stevens made it. If it was, it was one of the worst examples of digital remastering I have ever experienced. There was haloing around subjects that were sharpened, while the backgrounds appeared to be viewed through badly focused eyeglasses. It was so bad that I constantly kept checking to see when the movie would end. Giant is over three hours long. The documentary that came on the same disk, which appeared to be of a lower resolution, was sharper than much of the movie.

I had another experience with Warner Brothers that had to do, again, about misinformation. When I contacted the head office in Toronto, their response was, Well, theres nothing we can do about it.

My understanding about the Blu-ray process is that one is promised the ultimate clarity for this current technology. I find this not to be true of Warner Brothers. This was one of the worst Blu-ray experiences I ever had.

By the way, the Warner Brothers entry logo was super sharp.",1405036800,7,1212,4.702830188679245

8601599,3,B00E5QTVT6,"I have a SONY Blu-Ray player that upgrades all DVDs to 1080P. Isn't that close enough to Blu-Ray? And from the comments here, it seems like nobody is satisfied with these. Even Dean's windbreaker is blue instead of Red. I guess this was the intent of the DVD department. They have done this in the past too.
Having worked for Nick Adams, who was once a roommate of Jimmy. I don't want a Blu-Ray that isn't as good as my DVDs I can blow up on my Blu-Ray player to 1080P. I had a feeling it wouldn't get the treatment that other movies get on Blu-Ray, like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Cleopatra,"" and numerous others. Maybe they are waiting for 4K that is four times sharper than Blu-Ray. Yes, they will be coming soon and we have to have a TV that will play 4K and a DVD player that will play and upgrade to 4K.$$$",1389484800,,808,4.219354838709678
