5182111,1,B008TZX44C,"Seriously, Fanboy and Chum-Chum had to be one of the worst cartoons of all time.

Basically, the main characters are very annoying as heck, almost all of the other characters are unlikable and boring and the humor isn't much better.

Anyhow, crap like Fanboy and Chum-Chum should be banned from TV period.",1352246400,,305,4.846153846153846

DO NOT BUY PEOPLE it is a horrible show with unlikable caharacters,unintresting plots and unfunny jokes. Farts And Boogers are what this show relies one. Don't Buy it. I enjoy cartoons like regular show or rabbids invasion But this has got to go. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

I loved this order because i was looking for this DVD at DVD stores but couldn't get it, because of rare availability.
I got this in amazon.com. Thanks once again.

And another reason for loving this is, i have worked in this TV show :)

Anyway tons of thanks to you again.

8530400,5,B008TZX44C,"My seven year old and four year old love this series. They can quote from it and even play Fanboy Chum Chum roles play from time to time. I myself find the series quite enjoyable as well. There's lots of reference to pop culture (star wars, harry potter and the like) and lots of satire of everyday life. If you're expecting something serious with character development (as many on the lower reviews seem to lament on) then you're looking in the wrong place, this is just wacky fun although there are many layers if you're prepared to give it a chance.",1438473600,,552,4.475247524752476
