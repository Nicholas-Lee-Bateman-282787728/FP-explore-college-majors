8359074,4,B002A8G6U8,"I bought this movie since my mom was indeed put in the institution at the Lake. I was shocked at how it resembled a vacation of sorts. I thought it would have been more institutionalized, and her care more like that of a prison vs a resort. Thankfully, she was only a young girl, and did not have TB. She did get exposed to TB there, and that has followed her throughout her life. I really wish it went into more detail about the Wallum Lake Hospital, but it was good for general information. I had to have this dvd, since my mom died in 2007, and I can not find anymore information about her stay there. So my attatchment to this movie is an emotional one, not a historical one.",1306886400,,679,4.190839694656488
8359075,5,B002A8G6U8,"What I enjoy most about a great documentary is that it is entertaining and that I learn something.  On the Lake is a winner on both counts.  To hear firsthand accounts from the victims as well as from their letters was fascinating and personal.  It's a time that I knew little about and while I'm not sure I'll ever truly understand what it might be like to be placed in a sanitarium, I feel like I have a better insight of the day to day life of what they might have experienced.

I will also confess that I didn't know that TB is still, to this day, one of the deadliest diseases on earth.  Amazing.

I highly recommend this documentary to any and everyone.",1246665600,3,659,4.274193548387097
8359076,5,B002A8G6U8,"I went to the premier of this show with C. Gale Perkins who was in the documentary. The premier took place  in Rhode Island when it first came out. ""On the Lake: Life and Love in a Distant Place"" is great in so many ways.

I bought a few DVD's so I could play it and show it to friends and also give them as gifts. This documentary was educational, very interesting, with serious moments, humorous moments, it has everything. It tells all there is to learn about the disease of tuberculosis, plus they had several patients that was in the tuberculosis hospital during the outbreak of tuberculosis and they were great stories.

Actually the truth is I just came online to order two more copies of ""On the Lake: Life and Love in a Distant Place"",from Amazon.com. I am in awe of the great job G.Wayne Miller and David Bettencourt did in making this show. I would recommend this documentary as one of the best.",1245888000,,906,4.445783132530121
