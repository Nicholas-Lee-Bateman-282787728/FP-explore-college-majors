8306322,3,B001GNG2Z2,"A little-known, even minor Western from 1956 has ties to much of old classic Hollywood. ""Hidden Guns"" has that. Outlaw gang-leader Stragg(Bruce Bennett) wants more control of the Old West's Youngstown. The sheriff rides off to the next town to find a witness who will testify against Stragg. Watch out. Stragg has hired gunslinger Snipe Harding to shoot the sheriff and his witness from behind. ""Hidden Guns"" stars Richard Arlen, who's career dates back to the silent era(1928's ""Wings""), and also stars veteran character actor John Carradine. Old-timer Edmund Cobb is here, along with Errol Flynn's movie side-kick, Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams. Filming for ""Hidden Guns"" surely included the Republic Movie Ranch, which Walt Disney purchased in 1959, while still in use. The attractive site is in Placerita Canyon near Newhall, and not far from Soledad Canyon. Disney bought the site(315 acres) and later expanded it to 691 acres, with more Old West improvements. A Hollywood Western treasure, the Disney Golden Oak Ranch is not open to the public. Lots of history,and some fun, hidden away in ""Hidden Guns"". In a small part is a pretty 26-year-old actress(in her fifth movie) known as Angie Dickinson.",1383177600,,1199,5.153846153846154
