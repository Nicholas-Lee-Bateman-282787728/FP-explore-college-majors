8669290,5,B00M0D28ZA,"Given that the libretto of this Lyric Comedy, in particular acts 2 and 3, has many inconsistencies, and at some points is diffuse, it is left to the singers to render a convincing plot.  Fleming and Hampson do as good a job as can be expected.
Arabella was intended to be a second Der Rozenkavalier. There are many similarities in the plot and certainly in some of the musical ideas.  It never got to be as popular as Der Rozenkavalier, maybe due to its weak libretto, but it still has very memorable music.  The soliloquy at the end of act 1 is just one example of particularly sublime music.
The staging is minimalistic; even the majestic stairs are not there.  It is up to the singers to create as much drama and comedy as possible.  This is very effective and allows for the music to do its magic.  The cast is first class; Fleming and Hampson are a perfect for the roles and it shows.  The video recording is of great quality and allows the singers to show expressions in close-ups that I wonder if the audience at the theater could appreciate.  Highly recommended.",1490486400,,1070,4.479381443298969
8669291,5,B00M0D28ZA,I love the operas of Strauss and this production is terrific. Great singing and acting by Renee Fleming in a role perfect for her voice. Great cast and good production as well.,1456099200,,176,4.53125
8669292,5,B00M0D28ZA,Renee Fleming and Thomas Hampson are perfectly cast in Strauss' Arabella. This performance is beautifully sung throughout and Arabella and Mandrika have believable chemistry on stage. Get this to see Ms. Fleming and Mr. Hampson still at the top of their craft and artistry. Two of the best interpreters of Strauss today. Bravo!,1433894400,3,327,5.188679245283019
8669293,5,B00M0D28ZA,I  was impressed with Thomas Hampson's performance as Mandryka. This is a good production.,1431907200,,90,5.428571428571429
8669294,5,B00M0D28ZA,A perfect  Arabella.  Lends extremely well to her voice,1416787200,,55,5.0
8669295,5,B00M0D28ZA,Ravishingly beautiful singing of Strauss's neo-Rosenkavalier lush score that stirs the heart and senses in a wonderfully apt modern production.,1416614400,,143,6.2
8669296,3,B00M0D28ZA,"Of all the DVDs on Arabella, there are only two non-Munich (full-length) performances. This is one of them. The only reason I give it three stars is because it is complete and it has Renne Fleming. The other one (a five star performance) was directed by Otto Schenk, conducted by Sir Georg Solti, and sung by Gundula Janowitz in 1977. I was hoping a thirty-seven year gap would give us a good performance of the complete Arabella, but this one is a huge disappointment. I bought this DVD on Amazon, so I am allowed to review it.

If you would like to see six singers standing rooted and spread out on stage during the final scene, be sure to purchase this DVD.

The static singers all stand facing the audience, not facing the person to whom they are speaking.
In this final dialog scene, Arabella stands at stage front-far-right, Mandryka is at front-far-left, the father is at middle-left-quarter, the mother is at rear-far-right, Zendka is at middle-left-center, Matteo is at middle-right-center.

The dialog goes as follows (my paraphrase):-
Arabella forgives Mandryka.
Mandryka replies that he does not deserve it.
Arabella tells him to hush, and hints there should be a 'shotgun wedding.'
Mandryka gets the hint. So he asks the father to accept Matteo to marry Zendka.
Zendka asks her father if this means she does not have to kill herself.
Arabella tells Zendka she should enjoy what she deserves.
Father tells Zendka not to cry, and asks Matteo for his hand. ""Reichen Sie mir ihre Hand, mien Herr.""
Mother tells the father, it is a wonderful turn of events.
Arabella asks her mother to take Zendka upstairs.
Zendka yells for Matteo.
Etc, etc.

All this dialog is sung without any movement of the singers, or turning to face the other person.

I learned stage managing in college 65 years ago. This is a rather strange staging.
Also, the stage is practically bare, and Zendka is practically topless.",1412985600,7,1906,4.798780487804878
