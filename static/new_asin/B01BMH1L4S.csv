8750696,4,B01BMH1L4S,I prefer this over the other Nazareth flick. With a bonus silent DVD. Interested in Christian cinema? Try this.,1504828800,,111,4.894736842105263

8750698,1,B01BMH1L4S,"The film is a real masterpiece that deserves better.  This release from Alpha Home Video is virtually unwatchable.  The transfer is terrible--blurry, jumpy, cropped inter-titles, and out of focus with what appears some missing scenes.  The musical accompaniment sounds like a stuck record.  This title has been previously released by Kino Home Video, but is apparently now out of print. Save your money and avoid this release.",1460851200,,426,5.313432835820896
