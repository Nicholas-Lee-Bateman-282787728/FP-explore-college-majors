8096467,2,B000C8STDK,"This is a trilogy of Japanese horror with subscripts. The first tale centers on Satomi and her annoying doll. Seems the doll enters her dreams and can move on its own.

The second feature involves Yuta, a young boy gone camping being enticed by a basin ghost.

The third feature centers on Yukari and her two friends who visit a haunted inn.

The stories are written simplistically. The special effects are not good and the flying doll had me laughing when I should feel creepy. This is clearly written for a younger audience, i.e. Japanese tween girls having a sleep over wanting to scare themselves without having nightmares. For serious Japanese horror fans, the film leaves much to be desired.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. Girls talk about filming themselves in the nude while in the tub...don't get your hopes up.",1411689600,3,819,4.787234042553192
8096468,4,B000C8STDK,I really enjoyed the first and third stories but the middle one was weak. Cheesy special effects detract from strong plots and pacing. First story about a haunted doll is standard fare but there were truly creepy scenes ... with viscious biting!!! Third story was the most fully realized and kept me on the edge of my seat. Not too shabby. Will keep in permanent collection.,1362441600,,374,4.681818181818182
8096469,3,B000C8STDK,Hi! The DVD is a collection of 3 stories that loosly run together. Seems to have been taken from Japan TV shows. Dailogue is in Japanese only. Optional English subtitles. Title refers to themes of the three stories. North American DVD format. Not what I'd gift to a lover of Japanese cinema. If you like The Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside TV series this DVD may be right for your viewing. 65 minutes running time.,1338854400,2,423,4.5064935064935066
8096470,3,B000C8STDK,"Curse, Death, and Spirit (Hideo Nakata, 1992)

This disc, containing three tales Nakata did for a Japanese TV series in the early nineties, exists solely to capitalize on Nakata's sudden popularity in America. Folks who were unaware that Nakata had done anything before Ring might be disappointed at these, which don't do much of anything to showcase the power Nakata brought to the table in such films as Chaos and Dark Water, but are pretty decent stories nonetheless. Nothing special for a TV horror series-- you've seen it all before-- but you'll get glimpses of Nakata's talent in its rough form.

There are three stories here, as you can gather from the title. The Curse is ""Cursed Doll,"" a pretty standard possessed-doll story. Girl, dead sister, sister's spirit in doll, you know the drill. Death is ""Spirit of the Dead,"" which is a bit less obvious in the hearts it wears on its sleeve; a woman, devastated by the recent death of her husband, takes her child on an outing to the woods with some friends, only to find out that the clearing where they've set up camp is haunted by the ghost of a drowned woman-- who wants to claim the main character's son as her own. For Spirit we get ""The Haunted Inn,"" which involves three teenaged girls, an inn, and a mirror that holds the spirit of a previous guest at the inn. Sound familiar? If you know the name Hideo Nakata, it should.

As far as flat-out horror goes, it's not scary. As far as technical wizardry goes, nah, not much of that, either (the recent Hideshi Hino box's shorts blow these away in every technical aspect for roughly the same budget per episode). This is one for the folks who are interested in the earliest work of Hideo Nakata's career. This is where he's first exploring the obsessions that have driven him to choose the movies he's made in his career, and as a result they're fun for Nakata fans. Everyone else can probably avoid this without too much problem. ** ",1172534400,4,1943,4.606936416184971
8096471,1,B000C8STDK,"I felt very depressed after watching this having departed $15 of my money for these very boring short stories. I do not even recommend renting it.

""The Cursed Doll"" is about this doll that has Satomi's dead sister. Nothing scary, not even mildly, and a poor story line. The doll ends up biting Satomi's neck like some kind of vampire, and she ends up saying she feels her sister is looking over her lovingly. I yawned three times.

Story 2, ""The Spirit of the Dead"" is mildly entertaining, but the ending is soo disappointing. and I thought downright stupid. No yawns, but it really disappointed me.

Story 3, ""The Haunted In,"" totally boring. Not even a single fright session. I yawned about 4 times.

It's very hard to find good genuine horror...it's definitely not here.",1143244800,,774,4.711111111111111
8096472,5,B000C8STDK,"This title is another example of why Hideo Nakata (Ringu, Dark Water) is the best horror director in Hollywood, today.  This is a chilling three-part story that includes the tail of an evil doll, a haunted lake and a haunted hotel.  It may sound a bit formulaic but Nakata adds a dark touch that make these stories memorable and another treat for fans of Ringu.

In the Nakata style ""Curse, Death & Spirit"" is filled with ominous images of ghosts that seem friendly but in the end are unpredictable and frightening.  There are plenty of twists and turns in this film that will keep you jumping.

I definitely recommend this DVD for all horror lovers, especially those of you who are fans of ""The Ring"" franchise, and Asian horror films.",1132185600,11,736,4.630769230769231
