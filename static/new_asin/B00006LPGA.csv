7972287,3,B00006LPGA,"OK so-bad-it's-bad early 60's horror drek.  A young newlywed couple go on a bar crawl through Bourbon Street, New Orleans to view sub-par jazz musicians and mediocre belly dancers.  They then head to the family plantation to claim their inheritance.  Along the way they encounter one of the dancers who ended up with car trouble, so they bring her along on their honeymoon.  Once at the mansion they meet a cousin who has been caretaking the place.  The heir offers said cousin a share of the estate but that's not good enough for her.  She's seething because she wants the place all for herself.  She whips up some voodoo with the local plantation workers and revives her dead brother so he can take care of the interlopers.  The acting is at best barely adequate and at worst LOUSY.  Filmed at an actual estate with actual slave quarters and family mausoleums.  The color is vivid and the picture is pretty good, typical for a low-budget film of the period.  The Shriek Show DVD is excellent quality and has some extras and an even more obscure film tossed in for good measure.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1452902400,,1115,4.63265306122449
7972288,1,B00006LPGA,"Blood of the Zombie (1961)
 There are historical reasons to watch this B reel film from 1961.  We might want a peek into the authentic costumes of the day or to explore the social conventions that required women to attend a Bourbon Street jazz club in hats and gloves-and dresses of course.  Film fans might even want to dissect a low budget Hollywood film of the era for academic reasons.
 This sort of film at one time served as a time filler as the second feature at drive in movies.  By the second movie at a drive in theater, the young people had more to do than watch some miserable collection of color and movement on screen.  You, my friends, also have something more interesting to do.  Watch clouds perhaps or maybe your Wallaby needs a good wash down.
 Director/writer Barry Mahon has a very long career as a shlock meister in movie land.  In 21 years from 1959 to 1970 he directed some 60 films, none of them films you will remember.  His titles include Run Swinger Run, The Diary of Knockers McCalla and Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico.  You get the idea.  He never had the intent of making a good Zombie movie with Blood of the Zombie (AKA-The Dead One), he just wanted to make something, any thing that he could peddle to the lowest rung of the movie biz ladder.
 He did make a lot of films and his experience shows (even at this, his 6th movie).  The production values are about standard for inexpensive films of the day although I found the sound pretty rough, picky me.  I did wonder about the wooden acting but discovered that the principal actors are novices and non professionals.  The ones with even a handful of credits are actors who served with Mahon on other pictures.  None of them are given very much in the script to work with and none of them can do much with what little they are given.
 In the story, a guy gets married, he and the  bride tour the clubs of Bourbon Street then take to the swamps to the anti-bellum plantation house he just inherited.  The strange will granted him the property only upon his marriage.  Monica, his female cousin and Voodoo priestess has been running the estate and plans to keep on running it-if only her dead Zombie brother can murder the bride, reversing the marriage clause in the will.  And.... well, never mind.  Even if it made good sense you don't want to watch this very poorly made film.
 This one star film has one traditional, slow Voodoo Zombie, horrible acting, huge continuity problems but still manages to last for one hour and 11 minutes.  It is not rated but the worst things are smoking, one murder and another killing and a belly dance performed by Bella Bella, straight from the harem of King Faruke.
 Skip this one.",1432080000,,2698,4.477459016393443
7972289,4,B00006LPGA,"With a running time of under 70 minutes, this obscure film succeeds in being an excellent late night film. Non-explicit and without a lot happening during the course of the movie, it still gets you involved and is nice to view late at night. During the opening credits, the zombie is reanimated from a voodoo ritual and leaves his above ground crypt; this is the last you see of him for awhile. The film then switches to a couple who are traveling to inherit a plantation called ""Kenelworth,"" which is where that crypt of the zombie is. They stop at a club and are here for around 10 minutes, which then just showcases stuff like dancing and jazz music. Once they leave, they meet a girl who was at the nightclub. Her car has broken down, so they pick her up and go to the plantation. It is a very easy to follow film. That zombie in the beginning doesn't rise again until over the 40 minute mark, after which he bloodlessly kills one person. Aside from that death, there's only one other bloodless death from a gunshot during the climax and there's no gore when the zombie dies. No nudity is in the film either. It's a tame, non-intense film lacking in action with not much happening throughout most of it. However, it has a great nostalgic feel and look, as well as a 60s style directing that I thought was good. The isolated countryside plantation with the house and the night sequences provide some excellent, old-style type scenery and atmosphere; there's no rain or storms or anything like that in the movie, but I thought it still managed to succeed in providing a late night type viewing atmosphere because of the plantation and night sequences. The film is basically at a PG rated level of explicitness. Nevertheless, I liked that 60s club sequence and the entire atmospheric type quality and look of the film. If you want something that's nostalgic for a late night viewing, then this is it; however, remember it's tame, mostly calm toned, and that zombie has only a limited amount of screen time.

The DVD quality is very good. You also get a full movie for an extra called VOODOO SWAMP. This was obviously filmed without sound, and the sound was later put into it. It's also an obviously unfinished film. This has an unfortunate shooting of a real boar, which I guess is to add shock value to the film, and it has some violence that includes a machete decapitation towards the end. This movie has a great swampy location where they filmed it, and it concentrates more on its scenery with the swamp than action or violence. I think it would've been better with nudity and more gore, but this is also a really good late night flick if you like this stuff that has you looking at a swamp. It would qualify for an R-rating, but many may be bored by it and want more action and violence. The quality on this one varies with some different colors tinting the screen in parts, but the quality isn't bad for something obscure like this and unfinished.",1421107200,,2955,4.533707865168539
7972290,1,B00006LPGA,"THE DEAD ONE (pointlessly retitled here as BLOOD OF THE ZOMBIE) was considered a lost film for decades, but eventually the negative turned up and inspired a pair of rival DVD releases (with Something Weird's non-anamorphic but 2.35:1 framed release getting yanked right before street date). Meanwhile Sam Sherman slapped a new title card and a fake Independent International logo at the beginning for this Media Blasters release, which quickly turned into a technical disaster that still hasn't been fixed over eight years later. The first few minutes are severely cropped to 1.78:1, then the rest of the film unfolds vertically squeezed within the 1.78:1 frame and looks completely ridiculous. Though the package doesn't mention it, you also get a second (incredibly tedious) bonus feature with people lolling around in a swamp. Anyway, this Barry Mahon zombie film is a colorful, jazzy little number that shows how naive and charming these things were before George Romero changed the entire game in late '60s. Here's hoping someone treats it better down the line.",1288828800,4,1066,5.203488372093023
7972291,2,B00006LPGA,"Writer/Director/Producer Barry Mahon, who gave us Santa and the Three Bears, started out with cheesy flicks like this one, better known as The Dead One.

Despite the low grade script by Mahon, and the Grade Z acting, this was a fascinating zombie picture, set appropriately in New Orleans.

John MacKay may be investigating fellow cops on ""Law & Order"" but this baby is in his early career. His wife, Linda Ormond, was probably too ashamed to make another movie, as was the zombie, Uncle Jonas (Clyde Kelly), who was the perfect zombie. he had the clothes and the walk and the movement down pat. He should be in the Zombie Hall of Fame, if there is one.

Good for a laugh and a look at the career work of Barry Mahon, an interesting character.",1227484800,,743,4.529850746268656
7972292,1,B00006LPGA,My family owned Kenilworth Plantation and we were just about to move in when the movie was filmed there around 1960. We watched the filming from the porch. The mosquitoes practically ate us up. The plot has to do with the wicked sister wanting to get control of Kenilworth. The movie was only shown in St. Bernard Parish where it was filmed and really bombed. Now it is being revived and is good for laughs. It was called The Dead One then. I tried to give it more than one star but couldn't get the rating to work. I'd give it a 4 for comedy although it wasn't made to be funny.,1218240000,2,579,4.178571428571429
7972293,1,B00006LPGA,"Wow. This movie really sucks. The plot is pointless and kind if hard to follow. I don't know why this is classified as a horror movie. The run time is an hour and a half and for about an hour and 15 mins all you watch is the couple talking. VERY SCARY!

Yes the movie was made in 1961 so the color is horrible. The audio is also not too pleasant. And not to bad mouth Shriek Show because they usually do a bang up job. The only time you see the zombie is during the last fifteen mins and even then nothing much more happens. And just so you know there is no blood or anything in this movie.

I'm just glad I only spent ten bucks on this.",1109376000,4,637,3.8923076923076922
7972294,5,B00006LPGA,"Shriek Show Video has come up with a real rare flick this time. It is Barry Mahon's long lost gem ""Blood Of The Zombie"" aka ""The Dead One.""
A very interesting story about a woman who brings back to life a rotting zombie to do her bidding. The print quality is very good and the color is vibrant in spots. It also co-stars Linda Ormand, wife of filmmaker Ron Ormond who gave the world such treats as Mesa Of Lost Women and Monster & The Stripper. Nice DVD release and I hope Shriek Show finds more rare gems like this. Highly Recommended for horror fans!!",1044230400,14,554,4.285714285714286
