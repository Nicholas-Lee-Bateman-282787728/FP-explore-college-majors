7743710,3,B01F5KLOZY,I found this concert to be less than their previous videos.  Bono was drunk?  I don't know but he just acted very much like a jackass.  The music still thrills and is just as tight and loose as before.,1511827200,,201,4.102564102564102

7743712,5,B01F5KLOZY,Absolutely brilliant production.  If you are a U2 fan you won't be able to stop watching it.  Make sure you have it on Master DTS 5.1 for the full on surround experience,1510444800,,169,4.25
7743713,1,B01F5KLOZY,"I  saw this concert when it originally aired a little while back, on HBO I think. The  HI DEFINITION quality of that video was what made the concert probably THE BEST video of ANY concert. It me want to relive it by buying this DVD.

The quality of this DVD is NTSC-like. And parts of it look like a pirated copy. Not exaggerating. Total disappointment. It is as if they recorded it with an iPhone 3.",1507593600,,400,4.2368421052631575

The product is awesome, 2 DVD's, 1 BR and with great extra stuff.",1501977600,,226,4.675
7743716,5,B01F5KLOZY,Any fan of U2 would not be disappointed with this DVD. I attended thier concert in Denver and saw this one on HBO and decided I want a copy.,1501113600,,140,3.8620689655172415

7743718,5,B01F5KLOZY,"I bought this for my hubbie as a gift since he is a huge fan.  He really liked looking through the package at all the little extras (pins, dog tags, etc.).  It was a fun night.  The video is pretty good, I can't complain about the quality, but I haven't seen the other videos.  It was rather expensive, but it was worth it for a gift.",1496620800,2,334,4.015151515151516

7743720,5,B01F5KLOZY,"I liked ""Songs of Innocence,"" but I didn't go into this Blu-Ray with high expectations. There have already been a bunch of U2 concert DVDs and I figured that this would simply be another in that line...just a good chronicle of where the band stands in 2015. But no, this is totally different than any previous U2 concert DVD, and truly just different than any concert I've ever seen. It's truly a stunning conceptual experience. This is a visual and musical experience unlike any concert I've ever seen before. It does a wonderful job of telling the story of the ""Songs of Innocence"" album, which revolves around Bono & The Edge's childhoods amidst the violence of war and a mother's death. Earlier songs are intertwined into this musical/visual narrative in a manner that makes it all a fascinating story. It helps the viewer see how much some of their key earlier songs reflected their personal journeys.",1496361600,2,906,4.814102564102564
7743721,5,B01F5KLOZY,It's classic cutting edge U2. What can I say? They know how to entertain and make great music.,1496016000,,94,4.277777777777778

7743723,5,B01F5KLOZY,love it,1495411200,,7,3.0
7743724,2,B01F5KLOZY,"EDIT: Turns out it was filmed in 1080i. Disappointing. I think I'm still going to get the Blu-Ray and live without the extras.

I received the DVD as a gift, so I want to be clear that I'm very grateful for it, but future buyers should get the Blu-Ray disc. The 2.5 hour concert is packed onto one DVD and the way they seem to have accomplished this is by doing 2 layers of interlaced video. It's probably okay if you viewed it on an old CRT screen, but nobody has those anymore.

Let me be clear, the concert is great, but on my 1080p TV, the interlacing was extremely distracting, and when I turned de-interlacing on in my media player the resulting blurriness was still moderately distracting. Do yourself a favor and buy the Blu-Ray.",1494892800,,737,4.411764705882353

7743734,3,B01F5KLOZY,"I'm a big U2 fan from before Joshua Tree, and of course I would buy any DVD that the band puts out.  The sound quality was great.  The video quality was great.  However, many of the images on the video were out of focus, especially any video of the band.  It would seem, given modern video equipment and a video that was (I'm assuming) sanctioned by the band, that the images would have been more in focus.  YMMV.",1486080000,,413,4.243589743589744

7743741,5,B01F5KLOZY,"U2 fan for years so I had to add it to the many other DVD shows I have with the boys from Dublin.  I saw this show live in the states and it was better live of coarse.  The sound on the DVD is acceptable.  I guess this show gave more meaning because it was shot in Paris after postponing the original show because of the Paris Terrorist attacks.  Do yourself a favor though.  Buy this in Blue ray. Although the DVD is in High Def,  it's not great on a big screen TV.  Okay on a computer screen though.  Plan on buying the BR version soon.",1484438400,,538,3.9626168224299065
7743742,4,B01F5KLOZY,"U2 seems to get better over time. The new material gets greater life played live. Old material (which I would love to hear more of played live more recently by U2) sounds great, also. Very creative use of stage props and set-up. I am already a U2 fan but this makes me adore them more. Recommended to old fans and fans of their newer material...",1484352000,,345,4.323076923076923

7743785,5,B01F5KLOZY,"The boys keep rocking on.  Real instruments, actually playing, actual singing.  At first I thought Songs of Innocence sounded a bit like some b-sides.  After a couple listens, figured it out - genius and quite beautiful.  Pretty good translation live.  They do need to start dropping some concert mainstays. Beautiful Day and Elevation aren't necessary; there are better songs on ATYCLB.  Having seen every U2 tour since the ZooTV days, I think it is also time to start opening with Streets.  It has started feeling like more of an opener than a main set closer.",1470268800,,562,4.852631578947369

7743802,5,B01F5KLOZY,"I don't buy many deluxe box sets, but this one was well worth the money. The packaging is super sturdy and unique due to its unusual dimensions. Once you open it up, the reasons for that become clear as you flip through the book that captures the amazing set that U2 created for this tour. The USB light that comes with it is a little silly, but fun and rather sturdy. The accompanying buttons are a nice throwback to the old days of concert-going and loving bands.

When it comes to the DVDs themselves, the quality is wonderful, even though they're not Blu-Ray. (Why wouldn't these be Blu-Ray so that fans don't have to purchase that separately?). And the content is amazing----I saw this tour in person about 5 times and this performance has some truly amazing moments that at various times made me really tear up. I had never seen some of the extras (such as music videos, etc, so that was nice to have them all compiled here.

Whether you went to the concert and want to relive the memories or whether you didn't get a chance, this deluxe box set is a must-own for hardcore U2 fans that are able to splurge.",1468972800,5,1112,4.419512195121952

Overall mastering sounds a little flat, and not as colored and musical as I would like for a Blu Ray concert. I wish the instrumentals were more engaging, but instead, play back seat which results in a less 'live' concert experience. If only the  5.1 DTS-HD audio sounded more 'real' in terms of a live concert, the experience would be perfect.

7743824,5,B01F5KLOZY,"I saw their Chicago concert on this tour. Amazing production. The concert film captures the stunningly creative ""video wall"" and the interactive journey where the band takes the audience from innocence (or youth) to experience (older) and finally lifts the bridge between the two and performs songs from throughout their 30+ year career. The video extras are great as well. I know U2 takes a lot of flack for their ""biggest band in the world"" schtick, but for anyone, fan or casual observer, the show is simply great and stands on its own merits. Bono is in full, fine voice for being in his mid 50's, the Edge's guitar sparkles (or snarls) depending on the song, and Adam and Larry are probably more solid than they were 20 years ago.

7743826,5,B01F5KLOZY,"Probably my favorite U2 concert video (I have them all).  The performance itself is a solid B+ (the odds of capturing those rare legendary A++ concerts on the one night that the cameras are rolling are pretty slim for any act).

At least as significant as the performance is the fact that (for once) we actually have a well produced U2 concert video.  The video quality is as good as nearly any concert production I've seen.  The audio (both PCM and DTS HD tracks) is also stellar.  On top of all this I was please to see that Hamish Hamilton has found a cure for Parkinson's Disease.  The Boston Elevation video could throw Stephen Hawking into a full body seizure with its choppy flashy sequencing.

I care more about the music than the terror attack context surrounding this show, but I do think there's a bit of a resonance in the crowd from the wake of those events.  U2 has a better leg to stand on when it comes to making a statement on religiously masked terror, so the references to the attacks didn't feel contrived or anything less than sincere.  It's hard to say how much better or worse the show might have been if the acts of terror had not preceded it.

7743832,4,B01F5KLOZY,"For perspective on my opinion, I'm a pretty big fan of the band, having seen them over 20 times dating all the way back to the Boy tour in '81.  The only tour I missed was the Lovetown tour in 1989-90 simply because they didn't play North America that tour.  That said, I can objectively understand some complaints about Bono's politicizing during shows, the last few albums not up to their classic stuff and so on.  But all said, for a band that's coming up on 4 decades, they're aging remarkably well and still put on a compelling live show.

First off, for those that saw the live broadcast back in Dec on HBO, this home video release is an entirely different cut of the show.  Most of the camera angles are different then the HOBO broadcast but fortunately the awful rapid-fire cutting that plagued previous Hamish Hamilton directed U2 concert videos is somewhat less prevalent in this release.  Compared to the broadcast, the picture quality is vastly superior and the sound mix is better, though the mix is still a bit tame on the drums and Edge's guitar.  Anyone who saw this tour in person will attest to just how loud and in your face the sound was.  One thing that's a great addition that wasn't included on the HBO broadcast was the off/understage footage during the ""Fly"" video screen intermission that shows Bono actually sang live vocals over the pre-recorded track while he was getting cleaned up.

I saw two shows from this tour and while I'm not a fan of the album, I have to say the new songs translated much better in the live setting and the home video is a great representation of the show.

The extras include several different songs from the other Paris shows which is a nice touch although the band played about 20 other songs throughout the tour just a handful of times, some of which would have been nice inclusions as well.  There's also the promo videos and a couple docs about the tour and making the clips.

Overall, a very good document of the tour, far superior to the 360 Tour Rose Bowl home video (I was at that show).",1465603200,66,2052,4.501347708894879
7743833,5,B01F5KLOZY,"U2s music has the power to move me emotionally.  I hear the arguments that their later-period work is not as good as their earlier work.  What artist have we not heard that about?  But, be that as it may, I am talking about U2 now.  Though I, too, have thought, at times, that their post-Achtung Baby! albums haven't grabbed me in the same way as their earlier work, I have to remember that Ive been a U2 fan for 33 1/3 years.  When I was introduced to them, I was twenty.  I would lock myself in my room and listen to their albums over and over, eventually knowing and memorizing and internalizing every nuance of every song.  These days I will listen to them in my car and on my computer, but I don't devote the same amount of time and scrutiny to their music.  I still like their new music, but Im not as intimate with it.

The live experience makes me see songs in a new way, and I have often come home from a concert with a new appreciation for a song that hadnt grabbed me emotionally until I saw it live.  That new appreciation certainly applies to U2 and to their later music.  Though Im a very verbal person, I have never been one to listen to lyrics.  It is the sound of the music that grabs and holds me.  That being said, seeing a band live has a way of making me listen to the lyrics.  With U2, hearing the lyrics in a different context, along with the visuals they create for their tours, personalizes the songs and gives me a stronger appreciation of and connection to them.
The last time I saw them live was in 2005 on their Vertigo Tour.  Though I have bought every album, I only know their most recent tours from video.  I watched U2 live in Paris on HBO when it originally aired, and I enjoyed it.  I just finished watching it again on Blu-ray and it was overwhelming.  As I watched, I kept hearing Larry Mullen, Jr. in the Rattle and Hum film saying he hoped the film would be an emotional journey.  I started getting emotional almost from the beginning.  The sound of their music moves me; their lyrics move me; their live show moves me.  I think it is the music itself, but also the emotional memories triggered both by my experiences of seeing those same songs live in the past but also because their music has been a part of the soundtrack of my life for over 30 years.  Certain songs transport me back in time more effectively than any time machine ever could.

The bonus materials included with the Blu-ray are great too.  I had watched a poor YouTube clip of Patti Smith joining the band for ""People Have the Power,"" so I kept hoping she would appear at the HBO concert, but, alas, she did not.  It was even more disappointing because Smith had been opening for U2 on the Vertigo tour and I was hoping she would be the opening act when they got to Omaha.  Unfortunately, the night before they had played in Minneapolis and that was her last show with them.  We got Kanye West instead.  (And I have to admit, he wasn't bad, but he is no Patti Smith.)  So, to discover that the bonus materials include a performance of ""People Have the Power"" with Smith is fantastic.
I also loved that in the bonus materials they include a performance of ""Electric Co."" that contains a little snippet of ""Send in the Clowns.""  I have U2s Live at Red Rocks album from its original release in 1983 which includes a bit of ""Send in the Clowns"" which was edited from the song for subsequent releases due to copyright issues.

We can argue endlessly about U2 and their relevance, but to this middle-aged guy, they're still powerful and still one of my favorite bands.  At one of the ZooTv concerts I saw in 1992, my seat was situated so that my friend and I could see Bono waiting offstage, lighting his cigar for his entrance at the top of the show.  He looked up and waved.  I spontaneously waved back as if he had been waving only to me.  We had to laugh because the other hundred or more people who saw him waved back as well, thinking he was waving only to them.  And yes, I know its not the case, but in watching the Paris video, they were playing only to me.",1465603200,4,4069,4.280104712041885
7743834,5,B01F5KLOZY,"U2 has consistently done a great job of documenting every tour with an excellent Blu-Ray release of a specific show from that tour. When I saw the iNNOCENCE + eXPERIENCE show in Boston in 2015, I was blown away... but also had the passing thought, ""How in the HECK are they going to film this concert??!"" The enormous video wall that ran the length of the arena connecting the A Stage to the B Stage was unbelievably creative and impactful in person, but hard to describe to someone who wasn't there. They didn't just interact with the video... they got INSIDE it and created an experience unlike anything I've ever seen, heard, or felt. Normally at a U2 concert I want to be as close to the front of the stage as possible. But for this tour, I was advised to hang back and carve out a spot where we could see the whole screen and both stages. And I'm so glad we did.

To capture the experience on Blu-Ray DVD, U2 went to their 'go to' Director, Hamish Hamilton. He's the one who did a great job directing both 2001's ""Elevation Live in Boston"" and 2005's ""Vertigo Live in Chicago"" shows for DVD. For this ""iNNOCENCE + eXPERIENCE Live in Paris"" event, the camera coverage and editing is really effective and powerful without calling too much attention to itself. I especially appreciate they way Hamilton lets a shot rest for a few seconds before cutting to the next one. On camera, there is already so much going on that we don't need lots of distracting quick-cut edits getting in the way. And the shots they choose are frequently fascinating as they get inside, beneath, and behind the screen and the band in so many interesting ways. Watching this, my jaw was often on the ground just like it was in person at the actual show that I saw (which, bottom line, has to be the highest compliment to a video production, yes?)

This show in Paris had extra meaning and emotion given that the original concerts had to be postponed due to the bombings. Its poignancy reminded me of U2's post-9/11 Super Bowl halftime show. At one point during this show, the names of all 130 victims appear on screen, echoing the equally moving tribute during the Super Bowl. This show's encore also includes the band Eagles of Death Metal, who were playing at the Bataclan nightclub when it was tragically bombed by terrorists in November.

As for the show's highlights, I personally couldn't wait to see the sequence of ""Iris,"" ""Cedarwood Road,"" and ""Song For Someone"" where on the huge screen Bono walks through an animated recreation of his childhood streets and home in Dublin. They really captured it beautifully here. So cool. The intermission of ""The Fly"" showed the band back stage changing clothes, touching up their make-up, and Bono actually singing the song! (who knew?! I'd assumed it was taped.)  ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" reveals all four band members enclosed within the screen while bright, cotton-candy colors swirl around each of them like psychedelic confetti.

Bono seemed to make it his personal mission to interact with as many fans in the crowd as possible during this show, essentially making Paris an integral part of the eXPERIENCE. ""Elevation"" became a joyful 'Who's Who' of many stage dancers from U2's past concerts. ""Streets"" and ""Pride,"" soar, per usual, and ""With or Without You"" is gorgeous and intimate. I think only Bono can create this kind of intimacy with a crowd of 20,000 people. On ""City of Blinding Lights"", Bono invited a young man from the crowd to sing with him and, eventually, wear his coat and shades (which evidently he let him keep - talk about a souvenir!)

A lovely acoustic cover of Paul Simon's ""Mother and Child Reunion"" gives Bono a chance to speak to the need to keep fighting the battle against AIDS, which leads into solemn performances of ""Bad"" (which takes on new meaning, speaking to the disease of violence) and ""One"" (which feels like a unifying moment as the crowd sings the first two verses as One.) By the end of ""One,"" everyone is arm-in-arm, singing at the top of their voices. When the Eagles of Death Metal finally join U2 because ""they were robbed of their stage three weeks ago,"" their lead singer Jesse Hughes is genuinely choked up. Both bands tear into a powerful cover of ""People Have The Power"" and the crowd goes nuts. Finally, U2 graciously leave the stage and allow Eagles of Death Metal to end the show with their own song, """"I Love You All the Time."" Another great U2 moment.

Because U2 tweaks their set list from show to show, I'm really happy that the Bonus Material includes several songs from other Paris shows, including ""The Electric Co,"" ""Out of Control,"" and ""Bad/People Have the Power"" with Patti Smith. They've also included the music videos from the Songs of Innocence singles (since, let's face it, we don't get to see them on MTV anymore - or anywhere else for that matter.)",1465516800,34,4859,4.669392523364486
7743835,4,B01F5KLOZY,"I attended this tour in Boston and the performance I saw was superior to this Paris show in a few ways. I understand why they chose Paris for the video release since it had been the planned show for HBO and of course the significance of the attacks and the Eagles of Death Metal appearance, but I don't think it's the best representation of this amazing tour. Bono had some particularly strong vocals for this tour that I witnessed and that were shared on-line and I was surprised and disappointed that his vocals weren't that strong here. Other than that I give it 4 stars because it was still a brilliant show and anybody not fortunate enough to attend should see this amazing spectacle. Also, don't listen to the naysayers. It's popular to hate U2 now, maybe more than ever, but if you're really listening to the lyrics and paying attention to the songs they are as well crafted as ever and they are still breaking new ground. Don't miss the next album which will be a companion to this one.",1465516800,8,994,4.497237569060774

But truth is, U2 play plenty of old favorites to keep any fan happy.  And hearing him belt out ""Every Breaking Wave"" makes it a challenge against any older song.  My friend - who never saw U2 before this tour - literally shed a few tears during that song.  That's how powerfully it was performed.  The effects were both minimal and spectacular.  They didn't overwhelm like 360 or take away from the show like PopMart and arguably ZOO TV.  They flowed with the concert and songs to great effect.  Well done U2!",1465344000,9,681,4.291338582677166

This concert was originally scheduled to take place in Paris on the evening the terrorist attack occurred. U2 returned to Paris a few weeks later and the energy of both band and audience is heartfelt and intense.

Is it worth the price?  Yes.  Even without the trinkets thrown in.  40 years after forming, U2 are still on top of their game- especially Edge, who was a stand out on this tour.  Patti Smith and other surprises await you.

7743842,5,B01F5KLOZY,"I happened to get ahold of a copy of this concert since December and if this is that same concert in the same way it was broadcast on HBO all I can say is wow!

The set list is fantastic combining old an new songs while actually fitting a huge chunk of the new album. Stunning direction which showcases the stage beautifully. The Paris tribute was also a nice touch even if I personally didn't really care for it.

The performances of Raised by Wolves and the Bullet/Zooropa combo were among the highlights as well as the Iris/Cedarwood Road/Song for Someone trio.

Edit: Well after viewing the release copy since I wrote this before this particular cut release I have to add some minor things to add. I believe the original HBO broadcast is a much better production overall, the camera angles are better and so is the color correction. Another thing is the audio, the release version's audio has too much extra ""noise"" for my taste. Some examples include: a lot of unnecessary echoing of Bono's voice, a much louder audience and some changes on the instrument mix at some points. A good thing to note though was the addition of 'The Fly' as the intermission which wasn't on the HBO version.

My original points still stand, this is a great concert, don't let this deter you from getting it. Just some minor things to note so if you had seen/listened to the original HBO broadcast version prior.",1464739200,13,1395,4.590361445783133
