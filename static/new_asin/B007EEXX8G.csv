5079442,4,B007EEXX8G,"I like the way the Booth brothers present the history and stories surrounding the hauntings. But I just wish I could HEAR the interviews and EVP's. The music is so over powering that it drowns out the voices.  I had to constantly rewind to try and figure out what was being said. This is what happened in their last video.  I was hoping it wouldn't be the same here but sadly the music seemed more important for me to hear I guess lol . Thier previous videos were great! I could hear the interviews and the music was just  subtle in the background.  Other then that, if you can hear over VERY LOUD music, the children of the grave 2 is something I would recomend.",1337126400,11,663,4.28
5079443,5,B007EEXX8G,"The Booth Brothers and Keith Age are by far my idols.  I look up to them in every way.  I think they are amazing at what they do, and how they bring the story to our eyes.  I learned history on this documentary that I had no idea about.  They have respect for the deceased as well as everyone else they interview.  I have had the pleasure of meeting them, and they treat each and every one of their fans like their friends!  This documentary was just amazing.  I cried at certain parts (I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't seen it yet!)  Well done boys.  (As if I had any doubt).  I HIGHLY recommend this movie, and any other Booth Bros movies if you haven't already seen them.  They will make you cry, make you smile, and let you hear the REAL story behind the sadness.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.  Bravo!",1334361600,,843,4.12962962962963
5079444,5,B007EEXX8G,"Several years ago I was looking for something to watch on the Boob Tube and noticed on Sci Fi a documentary called Spooked The Ghosts of Waverly Hills. Being a fan of the paranormal and an investigator for over thirty years I decided to check it out. I was amazed at what I saw and have been a die hard Booth Brothers fan ever since. Their Films are like no documentaries You have ever seen before. Real investigations are masterfully blended with stunningly filmed recreations of true history. Working with the great Keith Age,in My opinion one of the best paranormal investigators out there,the Brothers Booth capture some of the best evidence I have ever seen. With Their latest release Children of the Grave 2,They have shown what a truly great documentary is. I consider Myself quite the history buff,but I always learn things I did not know with Their films. When You see that children were often thrown in with the dangerously insane,its no wonder places like Ashmore Estates have so many tortured souls trapped in them. You learn that the so called poor houses were also places where the deranged were mixed in with the homeless,including children. The Brothers,Christopher and Philip bring this terrible time in Our Nations history to life with a sense of realism that will touch Your heart. The evidence in COTG2 is no less amazing than the first COTG,in fact 2 has some of the most astounding thermal footage I have ever seen anywhere. There are also many awesome EVP,including a very creepy one caught by Phillips lovely Wife Ivana. Whats even more amazing is it was Her very first EVP!If You are already a fan of the Booth Brothers You will want to add this to Your collection. If You have never seen any of Their films,buy this and all of Their documentaries. No collection of the paranormal can be complete without them. Also if You should ever get the chance to go to a paranormal conference where They are going to be,do Yourself a favor and go meet Them in person. You will meet two of the most down to earth guys You could ever meet. These guys truly love their fans and treat all with kindness and respect. I am proud and honored to know Them and call Them friends. Even if I had never met Them I would still give this five stars. Children of the Grave is a true paranormal masterpiece.",1334102400,6,2306,4.599514563106796

5079452,4,B007EEXX8G,I've owned copies of this for a few years.  The Booth Brothers & Keith Age captured some very interesting things in this.  With the help of Bill Chappell that equipment used was top notch and the film shows the history of the locations they investigate.,1439164800,,253,4.6
5079453,5,B007EEXX8G,I absolutely LOVE the Booth brothers. They are very professional and have empathy for the spirits and history. I could never find anything bad to say about these guys.

5079456,1,B007EEXX8G,"This movie just drips with outright disinformation and fabrication. I used to live in the building that is in the first part of the movie, when it was MVBC (Mount Vernon Bible College). I lived there from 1982-1984 on the second floor. In fact, I lived in one of the rooms that used to have bars on the windows and padded walls. Lucky me, I was assigned to that room. But you know what? The entire year I lived in that room I saw no ghosts. For that matter, I saw no cockroaches or rats either. We did have a little field mouse come into a dorm room once in the winter-time, but gee, how many of you have had a mouse get into your garage or attic? The worst thing (and they didn't even mention this!) was the bats in the attic (above the 4th floor). They would circle the building at dusk. Once in awhile, one would get lose and get into the dorms...the guys would chase them down and get them with brooms or whatever they could find. But that was the only ""spooky"" thing about the building. Well, except for the basement. That was kinda spooky. But I had good times in this building, it holds good memories for me, but I am sad to see it in such disrepair. And this movie tried its best to make it ""spooky"", but geesh, what a farce! It failed miserably. I could tell the ""ghosts"" they saw were either a reflection from the window or a part of the stairway. It's an old building, but it definitely wasn't haunted when I lived there!  And just yesterday someone burned it down. Such a shame,",1435363200,3,1490,4.228070175438597

Unfortunately they try to pass off a broken out window glass frame in a dirty 6 frame window as paranormal through their specialty camera that record in IR, and UV and other filters.  You can see regular vision it is a broken out window pane not the face of a ghost.
Also, the EVPs are questionable again.",1432252800,,322,4.440677966101695

Slightly more ""production-y"" than Zak and Aaron's Ghost Adventures, Children Of The Grave 2 was entertaining but not terribly original.

5079471,2,B007EEXX8G,"It had more investigation than the first but still had some history. They seemed to stretch it to keep with the children theme. The EVPs had music superimposed over it which made it hard to hear. I could not stand the laser they used that moves. Its not only distracting but it doest show shadows well at all. The videography was better but not great and I still cant understand why they used a camera to tape another cameras screen instead of editing in the footage from the original camera. As well as they did the same with the thermal, which I feel if your making a second documentary for cable TV you should invest in with as much as you use it.",1420675200,,650,4.2926829268292686

5079474,1,B007EEXX8G,"So boring and laden with cliched ghost-hunting garbage I couldn't even sit through it - and I have a policy of sitting through even the worst of the worst in order to provide the best possible review. This one was just jam-packed with bad acting and terrible directing (despite the typical reliance on the gimmicky use of ""high tech"" equipment to ""catch"" ghosts). I get that some people out there believe everything they see, hence the 5 star reviews. But, thankfully, it's free on Amazon Prime so I did waste a penny. And, thankfully, I broke my own rule and didn't waste any more time on this train wreck. The Booth Brothers know enough about making videos of this kind to string out a product (and have managed, somehow, to sell some films) but this was unwatchable.

5079488,2,B007EEXX8G,"Interesting stories, interesting places they visit, and interesting people they talk to along the way. An attempt was made on the filmmaker's parts to get their research decently done, and they appear to be respectful of their environments, which doesn't always happen in paranormal documentaries. If it had been a documentary solely about creepy places and reported hauntings it would be 3.5 stars as they do go to places I hadn't heard of before and the re-enactments are suitably eerie, but the investigation scenes and the self-promotion (multiple references to themselves shown in TV clips and newspapers) drag the whole thing down. The evidence they find, to me, was not convincing and felt like a stretch of common sense.

This film has very little to do with children and is mostly done in your ""TV"" style ghost hunting show fashion. Although there was potential with this film the Booth brothers fell short on this one. Little background information is given on the locations investigated and what is given is not backed up by historians, documentation, or experiences. At least not to the level that could be considered a documentary.

I was so intrigued by the 1st film that I HAD to buy the second film. Again...I had no disappointments! Being a Paranormal Investigator, thie film has had a HUGE impact on all of my paranormal researching. Its taught me compassion, respect, mercy, and so much more, when it comes to the children spirits. Everyday we take advantage of running our lives, as well as others. This tear-jerking, lump-in-the-throat, high-suspense, thriller of a movie couldn't keep me on the edge of my seat. I just hope that the Booth Brothers make a trilogy of Children Of The Grave (what my clients keep begging for more films like this as...soon as COTG-3, but I have to keep breaking their hearts by telling them that I don't even know of any COTG-3 coming in the future).

The paranormal evidence is sparse, most of it purloined from previous investigations.

The cut-in photos are overplayed and rarely related to the site. The scripted drama scenes are overused, the most egregious being towards the end of the film and a child with a sack over his head.
The sack itself was an exercise in bad horror movie props that was absolutely apropos of nothing.

The kid was from a rich family and by all accounts, loved. If he did wear a sack, I doubt if it looked like it came out of the sewer, with stitching over the eyes and mouth.

The sites they visit are so inadvertently blended together, without any end statement on their investigation, it is difficult to tell when they switch from one location to another. The use of the same lighting and filters throughout the film aid in the blurring of sequence.

The score and sound effects are an exercise in self indulgence.

Either they simply didn't come up with much, and were still on the line to make a film, or their sensibilities for dramatization of the non-existent hit herculean levels.",1376870400,,1222,4.660465116279069

I had the pleasure of first meeting Christopher Saint Booth in 2011.  Later in 2012, myself and my wife Connie ran into Christopher at the Central Texas Paranormal Conference in Austin, Texas in October 2012, and we had a lot more time to hang out and talk about the paranormal filmmaking world and life.  I recently acquired all of the Booth Brother films, of which some of them, I had not seen before.  I could not wait to see the ones that I had not seen yet.  Children Of The Grave II was one of these great films I finally was able to see recently.  I was always extremely impressed with their work from many years ago when they came out with their first documentary feature that was on the SyFy Network.  Being a serious experienced paranormal researcher who has done this for many years now having investigated many different locations and having found a lot of very strong paranormal evidence in the process, I found Children Of The Grave II to be very good in their cinematography as to telling all the haunted stories, encounters, and discovered true paranormal evidence in such a perspective that is very human as well as from a shocking paranormal world viewpoint.  The locations in Children Of The Grave II are very worth seeing as to the things they discovered in those locations.  The paranormal stories and encounters by people in those locations is just incredible.  I wish that I had the opportunity to see this film right when it was first released.  There will be no duplicate of the original Children Of The Grave, but Children Of The Grave II takes a person even deeper within this very real mysterious paranormal/supernatural world.  I know this, because myself, my wife Connie, and our team group Graveyard Shift Paranormal Investigations in Texas walk within this same world as to investigating/researching mysterious paranormal locations and we are always looking for new discovery.  All of these locations have a story that is waiting to be told, and with Children Of The Grave II........there is no better ghost story than the ones that are real and lived.  I also hope one of these days to work in some capacity alongside The Booth Brothers and others in one of their future paranormal productions, because they are very talented at presenting the real paranormal world the way it should be.  I personally highly recommend anyone with an interest in the real paranormal/supernatural world to watch Children Of The Grave II, you will love this film.

I have become a big fan of the Booth Brothers and have seen most all of their documentaries. I would highly recommend their work to any fans of the paranormal. I hope they continue to make these documentaries, I will certainly continue to buy them!",1354838400,,366,4.477611940298507

They needed to have their pain and heart be opened to everyone. At least we are given the chance to pray and try to help, so this doesn't happen again to such tender young spirits.",1344384000,,301,4.033333333333333

8515252,1,B007EEXX8G,"The Booth Brothers have always been fraudsters of the higest order, whether it is presenting facts, information or even believable evidence, I trust these fellas as far as I can spit. All of their films always have poor production quality, even for a ghost hunting/documentary film.

I have no idea where their popularity comes from, if people genuinely believe these idiots or if it's like ""The Room"", where everyone is just laughing at them. Either way, this isn't worth your time, money or energy, even when it's free.",1476489600,,521,4.920454545454546
