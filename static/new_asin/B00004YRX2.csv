1378171,3,B00004YRX2,"It seems bizarre now, but back in the late sixties, Casey Kasem (of American Top 40 fame) was part of a production team that put out two biker flicks, but then left the world of cycles and exploitation to become the voice of Shaggy from Scooby Doo.  (It's true, you can look it up)  One of those biker flicks was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glory-Stompers/dp/B005E7SFK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glory Stompers</a>&nbsp;with Dennis Hopper, the other was Cycle Savages, this time with Bruce Dern.  As far as entertainment goes, I'd give the edge to Savages, but there are a lot fewer cycles in it than you might think with a name like Cycle Savages.  Most of the cycle action is implied; after establishing that Dern and his cronies are part of an outlaw biker gang, the greater part of the action from then on out takes place in their low rent, pill-popping party house.

So, less motorcycle action, but a marginally grittier film than The Glory Stompers, as Dern plays the psychopath Keeg, a low-level provider of prostitutes for his big brother (played by Kasem).  Problem is, a neighborhood artist has been sketching Keeg and the boys during some of their more brutal diversions, and has a good likeness of them in his portfolio.  Worried that the artist has leverage on them should he ever decide to go to the police, Keeg first tries to intimidate him, then, when that doesn't work, takes a more aggressive line to make the artist never draws them again.

Fans of biker flicks in general may be a little disappointed in this one.  As I say, there's little bike action, but I think overall it makes up for it with the cheesy exploitation.  Dern sounds like he's ad-libbing most of the time, but he brings it off pretty well, and even though the movie seems pretty tame by today's standards, there's still a brutal rape scene half-way through.  Chris Robinson (who would go on to Snakesploitation fame with the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley/dp/B005ELEMW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley</a>) plays Romko, the young, stubborn artist who won't bend to Keeg's demands, and Melody Patterson is the beautiful but stained woman Keeg tries to use against him.  Most everyone handles their parts well enough so that at least they don't stick out, but this is really Bruce Dern's film as he chews through scene after scene until he faces the same fate every cycle leader faces in all the biker flicks I've ever seen.

I liked the movie, but realistically it's a toss-up between two and three stars.  I say if you see the title and the poster art and think, wow, that sounds cool, you'll probably get a kick out of it if you keep your expectations to a minimum.  If, on the other hand, you not into exploitation, then I say move along folks, nothing to see here.",1340323200,2,2873,5.057203389830509
1378172,1,B00004YRX2,"I'm not sure why they call this movie Cycle Savages. There's very little in the way of cycles and not much for ""savagery"" either. Bruce Dern does his best to elevate it but it's almost as lame as Rebel Rousers and nowhere near as good as he was in The Wild Angels. Melody Patterson's (F Troop) semi-nude scenes are mild, the alleged gang-rape is bland; these guys seem a lot more like juvenile delinquents that outlaw motorcycle gang members. They're about as ""savage"" as Eric Von Zipper's Ratz and Mice M/C in the beach movies. And the plot...they're worried about sketches someone made of a minor scene at a fast food place? Come on, like that would really hold up in court even then. There's some really good biker movies from the 60's, but this isn't one of them. Not even any good motorcycles to redeem this.",1115856000,2,813,4.537414965986395
1378173,3,B00004YRX2,"Trying to cash in on the biker film craze started by films such as Hell's Angels on Wheels and Wild in the Streets in the late 60's, Cycle Savages takes the genre to new highs and lows.  A vicious gang of motorcycle bad boys track down and attempt to kill a struggling, sensitive artist after he sketches some pretty half-assed drawings of them from afar, but the situation becomes even more perplexing when the artist begins sleeping with one of the female contacts of the cyclist troupe.  Bruce Dern, the head savage, is repulsive in the role of the heartless, immoral womanizer, but I'm not so sure if this is due in large part to his character or the awful acting that is way below the usual standard of his ability.  There are a couple of disturbing, almost unwatchable scenes, the gang rape of a naive, buxom blonde being one, but overall this is a highly entertaining piece of B movie exploitation that rides on its revved up garagey theme song and ridiculous depiction of the carefree, rebellious , drugged out thugs who embody the film.  Recommended for late night laughs.",1102982400,,1081,4.643979057591623

1378175,3,B00004YRX2,"Bruce Dern again plays a mean biker creep! Unfortunate for an artist who runs into Dern and gets beaten up.

7927637,5,B00004YRX2,If your a follower of the classic 1960's motorcycle gang movies this will be another must see for you. If you're a fan of Bruce Dern you will enjoy this movie even more.,1403740800,,169,4.151515151515151
7927638,1,B00004YRX2,"Released in 1969, ""The Cycle Savages"" starts off like it might be a decent cheap biker flick in the manner of, say, ""Angel Unchained"" (1970). The opening credits sequence is effective and the pre-heavy metal hard rock theme is simple, but enjoyable, particularly the energetic percussion. On top of this, Bruce Dern is effective as Keeg, the ee-vil leader of Hell's Chosen Few, Chris Robinson is solid as the courageous protagonist and there are a few quality gals -- Dern's brunette babe, Sandy (Maray Ayres), and two blonds, Lea and Janie (Melody Patterson and Karen Ciral). It's also cool to check out the late 60's California locations.

Unfortunately these are the only good things I can say about this flick. The plot is really really DUMB; like it was conjured up by a 12 year-old. It involves Keeg getting upset over a sketch artist for making drawings of his gang in wild revelry. Apparently, Keeg believes the sketches can be used to convict him and his gang (Why sure!). The dialogue and acting are just as bad. At one point they put the artist's hands in a vice, threatening to crush them, but it's clear that he can remove his hands at any time.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't tell you how awful this ""film"" is. At least a cheapo biker flick like ""The Tormentors"" is entertaining and has a semi-interesting story, but ""The Cycle Savages"" can't even do that. It's only worthwhile for a few good-looking late 60's ""chicks"" and as a period-piece oddity.

The film runs 85 minutes.

GRADE: D-

PS: If you want to see a great late 60's/early 70's biker flick, catch the very first one, the infamous ""The Wild Angels"" from 1966 starring Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, Nancey Sinatra and Diane Ladd. ""The Wild Angels"" is simultaneously shocking and profoundly brilliant (yes, even though it's essentially a Roger Corman 'B' film).
