8227639,5,B000XAE8PA,"Bonzai's simple version of Jackie Chan's old film Magnificent Bodyguardsis probably the best one out there. It's dubbed in english only and has a soft, but okay looking remastered print. I am not sure whether or not it's uncut. Don't buy the other versions released by Beverly Wilshire or Ground Zero; they both contain horrible, muddy looking picture quality with the subtitles chopped off at both sides of the screen.",1370822400,,419,5.0
