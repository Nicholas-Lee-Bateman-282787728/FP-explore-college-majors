1863354,5,B00008VSET,I remember seeing and following this story on the news when it happened.  Watching it years later I cried throughout most of it.  Great movie.  Straightforward and I appreciate the fact they didn't cast a bunch of well known movie stars which I feel would have lessened the reality and severity of the situation the men and their families endured.,1402704000,2,347,4.75

1863358,5,B00008VSET,"This movie was such a good movie, but I would advise if you do not like the coal mines since there have been so many accidents then I don't think that you should watch it. I cried my eyes out. But other than that its such a good movie.",1207353600,2,235,3.816326530612245
1863359,4,B00008VSET,This is a very good movie based on a true story.  Trapped miners and what devestation it causes for the families not knowing whether they are a live or not after 5 days.,1168905600,2,169,4.121212121212121
1863360,4,B00008VSET,"This made-for-tv movie is based on a real life incident in 2002, when nine Pennsylvania coal miners were trapped for three days when water flooded their mine.  Partially shot at the Quecreek mine, where the accident happened, this movie is a realistic look at what the miners had to do to survive, as well as what their families went through while waiting for the miners to be rescued.

At just 90 minutes long, this is a fast paced and thrilling movie. The miners and their families are introduced in quick segments at the beginning of the movie and then the film moves right into the mine flooding and the miners struggle to say alive. The film alternates scenes in the mine with scenes of the miners families waiting at the fire hall for news of their loved ones.

The filmmakers do a good job filming the scenes with the trapped miners to the point where I felt claustrophobic watching some of the mine scenes.  Even though I knew the miners all got out safely, I was on the edge of my seat watching them struggle in the water. The scenes with the families are, with one or two exceptions, emotional without being cloying.

I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to fans of movies based on real-life events.",1113177600,6,1217,4.538812785388128

7987375,5,B00008VSET,"The Pennsylvania Miners' Story is one of my husband's favorite movies. He's the one who wanted to purchase the movie and I luckily found it on Amazon. This is a wonderful movie, but it really tugs at my heart strings. No matter how many time I watch it, I end up in tears. My husband has been an underground coal miner for 10 years, so this really hits home for us. This movie does a great job of allowing you to get to know the characters in such a short time frame- you feel like they are family. Even though I knew the outcome of the situation, since it is based on a real life event, I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time (every time) practically biting my nails. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everything. Just be advised, if there's a coal miner in your life.. this movie will open your eyes to a whole new set of ""what ifs"" that will run through your mind each and every time your miner goes off to work.",1453680000,,938,4.103260869565218
