2858375,5,B000R4QER2,"I just had to add another 5 stars to all the other 5 star reviews on here. My jaw just about hit the floor when I saw this DVD. Right out of the gate with ""Whiskey,"" the Charlie Daniels Band returns us to 1975 Southern rock heaven, with a take-no-prisoners style of stompin' boogie that had me mouthing the words, ""Oh my God,"" over and over again.

Lord have mercy! This thing rocks, it should be called ""Stompin' Room Only,"" but that title has already been taken by the Marshall Tucker Band. No matter... if you want stompin' Southern rock the way it was done in 1975, you NEED this DVD.  It sure is nice having guests from the other Southern rock bands of the era, but really this DVD is all about the Charlie Daniels Band AT THEIR PRIME.

I could go on and on with metaphors, comparisons, adjectives, superlatives, as well as my own experiences with this band in 1975 and 1976. This DVD's intense mojo speaks for itself. Suffice it to say, it's awesome.  Buy it!",1183852800,4,965,4.374301675977653

2858379,4,B000R4QER2,Didn't know Charlie Daniels could rock like this. Most of Marshall Tucker is here as well. Seems like it was transferred from VHS though. Would be nice to see this remastered.,1439164800,,175,4.67741935483871
2858380,5,B000R4QER2,"I was there that night. September 12th, 1975, MTSU's Murphy Center. Tickets were priced low, and it went on for hours. Granted, with today's HD TVs, and players, the video  hasn't aged well, but the audio is still great !!!
Having also attended the World Premiere, with Charlie, Toy, and the rest of the boys, I really waited a long time for this to come out on home video.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1421971200,2,393,4.535211267605634

2858388,4,B000R4QER2,Excellent audio in Dolby 5.1 and DTS (did not try 2.0 stereo).  Video is a bit poor but plenty good enough to enjoy this concert.  The band and the fans obviously have a large time.  The music is great stuff - several things I did not know but like now.,1411257600,2,253,4.02

2858390,5,B000R4QER2,"Rare live footage of some real players.  Caldwell Brothers at this time are in their prime, before the fame and it's trappings took them.  Great collection of top level talent in a truly historic moment.",1397001600,3,203,4.771428571428571

2858392,1,B000R4QER2,"Very disappointed with quality of video. If you like raw, uncensored 1960 style footage,you will appreciate this. A lot of up close shots,also a lot of dark(low light condition).It is not a bad video,however it is not a quality video either.",1365292800,,241,4.902439024390244
2858393,5,B000R4QER2,"I'm 21 years old and just got into CDB recently. I bought a few of their albums from the dollar LP section, and thought they were really good. I found this product and couldn't resist because I've been a Marshall tucker band fan for years.

I knew this DVD was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it is. This is top quality rock and roll played by talented and disciplined musicians. As much as I love Zeppelin, this movie really outshines ""The Song Remains the Same"" by a longshot. You can tell there was a lot of magic in the air that night. The musicians are really in their element, and the songs are great.

This DVD proves that CDB isn't just a southern rebel rock gimmick, this is a fine tuned, talented, disciplined, passionate band making a serious statement with their musical abilities.

If you have the inkling that you might like this DVD, because you like southern rock, classic rock, great live shows, or whatever, chances are you're going to love this.",1343520000,3,998,4.383783783783784

2858396,4,B000R4QER2,"I was disappointed in the quality of the video of this concert.  You can certainly tell it was done 30 years ago.  However, the audio quality is good, and there are many good jam songs on this DVD.  Vintage Marshall Tucker is always good to hear, and Charlie Daniels is always great in concert.  Since I couldn't be there when it happened, this was nice to see.",1271894400,3,361,4.343283582089552
2858397,4,B000R4QER2,"Charlie Daniels was the first concert I ever saw.

This vid was a great representation of the band back then.

These days Charlie Daniels is more known for his right wing jingoistic stuff and like Ted Nugent only secondarily as a musician.

This performance sort of takes me back and reminds me of the ""Long Haired Country Boy""  and what great instrumentalists he and his whole band was sort of before he kind of became the people he parodied in ""Uneasy Rider""

On the long jams forgot how much his sound recalls the Allmans and I think this really shows a person who may only know the ""Country"" Charlie Daniels what an amazing instrumental group CDB was. His guitar and bass players especially shine and the camera really catches the interaction of the musicians.

Thanks for the memories!",1260316800,4,790,4.688405797101449
2858398,3,B000R4QER2,"I was disappointed with the quality of this DVD.  They definitely jam on the video but the quality is not great at all.  If you like Charlie Daniels and good foot stomping music, it may still be worth it.",1252368000,2,204,4.205128205128205

2858400,5,B000R4QER2,"I have had the VHS tape of this concert for many years (from the now defunct VIDEO CLASSICS company) and, while it is an excellent concert, on tape it only runs to 59 minutes with titles included.
I am actually in the middle of transferring it from VHS to DVD as the tape is a shockingly bad reproduction on lousy quality tape. I suspect that the aforementioned company may have used pirated copies back then (early eighties) as even the back of the cover shows the run time as 90 minutes. Then again, one has to remember that this copy which I have dates back to very beginnings of videotapes being available in Australia.
Thank God the music transcends such crap.
I actually only tracked it down on here when I went looking to find a recording date and never knew that it had been released on DVD until now.
Finances and time allowing (I am unwell) I will try to avail myself of a copy of the DVD as soon as possible. In the meantime.................",1227916800,,952,4.4147727272727275
2858401,5,B000R4QER2,"THE FIRST FULL LENGTH SOUTHERN ROCK MOTION PICTURE"" ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION ON THE COVER. THIS CONCERT DVD CONTAINS VINTAGE SOUTHERN ROCK FROM IT'S GLORY DAY'S, IT WAS FILMED AT CHARLIE'S VOLUNTEER JAM IN 1975. IT CONTAINS PERFORMANCES BY THE CHARLIE DANIELS BAND, THE MARSHAL TUCKER BAND (INCLUDING TOY AND TOMMY CALDWELL), JIMMY HALL FROM WET WILLIE, DICKEY BETTS AND CHUCK LEAVELL OF THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND AND DRU LOMBAR.
IT CONTAINS EXCELLENT COLLABORATIONS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

It contains footage of Charlie riding his horse along with the music being performed.

It has a song set of 14 lengthly songs with a running time of approx. 123 minutes. Highlights include: ""Birmingham Blues"", ""Long Haired Country Boy"", ""No Place to go"", ""Texas"", ""The South's Gonna Do it Again"", ""orange blossom special"", ""Twenty four hour Blues"" (THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING COLLABORATION WITH DOUG GRAY OF THE MARSHAL TUCKER BAND SINGING), ""THE TRILL IS GONE"" (ANOTHER OUTSTANDING COLLABORATION!), ""JELLY BLUES"" (VERY OUTSTANDING COLLABORATION - CONTAINS JIMMY HALL OF WET WILLIE SINGING THE BLUES ""it's a mean old world when you try to live it all by yourself...why would my woman want a back door man when she has a good loving man like me""), and ""MOUNTAIN DEW"" (This contains a good-looking country woman banjo player).

It contains a bonus new interview with Charlie Daniels where he says he changed to words to ""long haired country boy"" from I get drunk in the mouring and I get stoned in the afternoon"" to I get up in the mourning and I get down in the afternoon"". This is a welcome change for me.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COLLABORATION CONCERT DVD OF SOUTHERN ROCK ALLSTARS IN THEIR PRIME. THE PERFOMANCES ARE SIMPLY SO OUTSTANDING THAT THEY DEFY WORDS TO DESCRIBE THEM. THIS IS A TRUE CLASSIC, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",1225238400,2,1813,4.934426229508197
2858402,5,B000R4QER2,"I have about 25 live rock concerts on DVD and they are all good. But, this Charlie Daniels concert is incredible.  Perfect camera angles, no special effects, no annoying quick cuts, no bad songs.  It is now my favorite.",1214438400,15,219,4.589743589743589
2858403,5,B000R4QER2,"This video archive of the second ""Volunteer Jam"" captures The Charlie Daniels Band and many of their contemporaries at their best. Years before the mass appeal of the huge hit ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" in 1979, the CDB was gathering legions of fans the old-fashioned way...by writing and recording great music, but even more importantly, taking it to the people in live concerts. This concert captures that era and that spirit very well.

The list of songs shows how this band and so many others of that time wrote and recorded songs that included long and elaborate ""jams"" that made the songs last several minutes longer than your usual 3 to 4 minute pop radio hit. That's why this group and so many others didn't have many songs on the radio, but people still bought and enjoyed the heck out of their records. Funny how the CDB is still around, while the acts who had hits in the Top 40 at that time are largely forgotten.

Extended songs like ""Birmingham Blues"" and ""No Place Left to Go"" show that song style perfectly, mixing rock, country, blues and jazz all together in  one song. Special guests from The Marshall Tucker Band, Dickie Betts from The Allman Brothers Band, and others make this concert even more special.

It's a can't miss purchase if you like mid-70s Southern Rock. If you don't, give this one a try. You just might change your tune.",1214352000,9,1362,4.615702479338843

2858407,5,B000R4QER2,"This DVD was out the door with me as soon as I saw it. The audio quality is superb, not like some music DVD's you can pick up.

8198841,5,B000R4QER2,"Wow!! This is one of the best southern rock concerts ever recorded. I thought CDB was more country. After I read reviews, and found one for $5, free ship, I rolled the dice. I'm glad I did. It has 3, or 4 guitars, 2, or 3 drummers, a harp (harmonica), fiddle (violin), horns, and a lady on banjo. Several songs have slide guitar. No place to go (song #5) lasts over 20 minutes. If you like southern rock, this is a must have. CDB + Marshall Tucker  Band, and guests from Allman Bros., Wet Willie, and others. It reminds me of an ABB jam session ( when they still had Duane). I forgot Charlie could play the guitar this good. This is a 2 hour jam, and I'm glad I volunteered to buy a copy. If I could give it 6-stars, I would. To make up for the dumb people that rate it too low. Please people, if you get a bad copy, don't leave your review here!! The bands are not to blame for that!!",1503532800,,885,4.028409090909091
