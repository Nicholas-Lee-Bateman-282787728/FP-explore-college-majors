8052009,5,B0007UZN32,"When I was young I saw Joe Lewis fight in his prime and he was a wrecking machine. I saw Mr. Lewis fight Chuck Norris in Madison Square Garden, New York City at Henry Cho's Internationals. Chuck Norris barely beat him by 1 point in over time. I later had the honor and increadible experience to train with Master Joe Lewis. This training dvd is like being at a school where he is teaching his craft. His personality is presented and his knowledge is excellent. He takes you from basic to advanced concepts. The course covers forward, backward, lateral and diagonal body and footwork. He teaches concepts of rythm, faking, deceptiveness, drawing footwork, broken rythm and circling. He teaches the blitz and how to counter someone attacking you with a blitz type attack. Also how to use the scramble step and pivot step. He covers attitude and mindset. I have been in the martial arts for over 40 years, I have taught for over 30 years. I must say I still can learn from Joe's work. Thank you Joe and God bless you where ever you are.",1373760000,,1033,4.529411764705882
