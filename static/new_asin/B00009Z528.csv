1899072,3,B00009Z528,Very classic attempt to show the inside of a Great Place in one contius camera shot..Pulled very well. This a classic,1361491200,,117,4.619047619047619
1899073,5,B00009Z528,Probably one of the best overviews of Russian History in the time of the maximum decadence in Tsarist Russia. The great thing is the wonderful tour of the Hermitage. I recently toured the Hermitage in one day and I strongly recommend that anyone going to St. Petersburg see this movie before going.,1359590400,2,298,4.75
1899074,1,B00009Z528,"This is the first review I have bothered to write and have bought hundreds of products of amazon.com.  I didn't listen to other reviews about the blurry quality and found out the hard way that this is $12 for a reason.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn it was pirated.  In fact, there was some ""Canada only"" stickers on the package. The disc also stalls out on a famously contiguous 90 minute no-cut first-of-a-kind film.  Garbage. Especially if you have not yet seen this film, do not watch this version as you will be cheated out of a fantastic cinematic experience.",1356480000,8,568,4.594059405940594
1899075,5,B00009Z528,"Very beautiful to see but you may need at least a little knowledge of Russian history even at the very allusive level of this film where much is implied but not overtly stated.

Very poignant at the end, I think.",1354147200,,212,4.3
1899076,2,B00009Z528,The positive reviews of this DVD motivated my ordering it. I was not able to see this DVD completely only some fragments.  The image was not stable and some times stopped completely. Regetfully I returned it.,1340409600,,208,4.777777777777778
1899077,4,B00009Z528,"This is a lovely video. A bit odd, because it is done in one single take with a high def camera.  However my Foreign Film club enjoyed it.",1340323200,,138,3.9285714285714284
1899078,5,B00009Z528,"I was glad to receive this DVD of 'Russian Ark' quickly and in pristine condition. The feature film is set in St Petersburg's Hermitage Museum, and is a quirky ghost story. It has a lot in common with another exceptional film, made by Alain Renais, called 'Last Year at Marienbad'. 'Last Year at Marienbad' was awarded the Golden Turkey Award for the most boring film ever made, by people who don't understand it. And I'm sure those very same people wouldn't care much for 'Russian Ark' either. But then this sort of criticism is often directed at cultural material which is brainy and hard to categorize. 'Russian Ark' is not only a delightful costume pageant and a feast for the eyes, but deploys a most unusual camera technique. It has been asserted this production was filmed in one take. However, being experienced with film editing myself, I can see how the 'whip-pan' has been used to conceal at least ten edits throughout the course of the movie. To shoot such a film with so few takes would have been a most daunting task. Without giving too much away, the main character forms a companionship with the Marquis de Sade, and together they stroll through the Hermitage Museum and have fleeting encounters with other ghosts along the way. 'Russian Ark' has one of the most sublimely moving conclusions that I have ever encountered in a motion picture film. The sparse dialogue is peppered with clues as to what the story is really about. Of course, everyone would naturally arrive at a somewhat different interpretation!",1332720000,4,1526,4.806083650190114
1899089,5,B00009Z528,"The Hermitage in St. Petersburg is the venue for a journey through Russian history, ending with a sumptuous re-creation of the last grand ball of the Czarist era.  The remarkable technical feat capturing the whole story in a single 90-minute shot is completely at the service.of the action, the color and the music.  I first saw this film in a theater when it was first released several years ago.  The DVD release is most welcome.",1394496000,,431,4.72
1899090,5,B00009Z528,"Is it a dream? Is it reality?  Am I there, participating?
Or am I really only an observer?
Magnificently produced film, the longest ever made with a single
camera following the actors through dozens of rooms in the Hermitage
Museum, unbelievable costumes, fantastically detailed.
A flawless journey into the half-remembered past....",1392940800,,332,5.509803921568627
1899091,5,B00009Z528,"I was intrigued by the fact that the entire movie was shot in one take.  Upon viewing it, I was  amazed.  The fact that it was filmed entirely within the Hermitage was an enormous additional benefit, and provided a fascinating backdrop for the cast.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the ""history"" of Russia as given in the dialogue.  It's a different sort of movie, but one that proves most entertaining.  Highly recommended.",1391817600,,419,4.830985915492958
1899092,4,B00009Z528,But we bought this because of the place most of the film was shot at.  We just returned from Russia.,1389312000,,100,4.0
1899093,4,B00009Z528,"Although it can induce sleep, the concept behind this film makes it worth seeing, especially for anyone interested in filmmaking.",1388707200,,129,5.5
1899094,1,B00009Z528,"We watched if for about 20 minutes and gave it up.  It is a Russian play taking place at the Hermitage with English subtitles. The play has no plot, hard to figure out who the characters are.  We had wanted to see something of the Hermitage,  we saw only the theater.  I was very disappointed.  I really wish someone would put into DVD the 1994 PBS production of the Hermitage that gave the history of the museum and shows some of the artwork.",1379808000,2,443,4.289156626506024
1899095,4,B00009Z528,"Two characters suddenly find themselves wandering through an opulent concert hall, museum, residence, and ballroom past various people of the last 3 centuries in St. Petersburg, Russia.  It's certainly a feast for the eyes.  You can't help but imagine how impossible this production would have been during the 80 years of communist rule.  It's downright nostalgic for the graceful and elegant times that existed before.",1375920000,,419,5.415384615384616
1899096,4,B00009Z528,"A very cleverly executed view of the history of the Hermitage -- but be aware that many DVD players in North America will not play this DVD which was region-coded for Europe.  Sony DVD players that are coded only for ""Region 1"" North America are absolutely not going to play this ""Region-2"" DVD.  I had to view it on my computer and returned it for credit because of the problems of playing it.  If you want to buy this, be certain to TRY to find a Region 1 copy and be prepared for disappointment if your DVD (or Blue-RAy) disc player is a Sony brand product.  Other brands MAY play it.",1371254400,4,587,4.261261261261262
1899097,4,B00009Z528,"This documentary gives the viewer a sense of what the palace was like at the Hermitage at the time of it's founding.
It's not really for viewing the art collection.",1365206400,2,164,4.5
1899098,5,B00009Z528,"A very unique film, and a great opportunity to see inside the Hermitage. This film was entirely made in one 90 minute shooting, which is very unusual for today.",1362355200,,160,4.551724137931035

7994646,5,B00009Z528,"Recently I saw so many great art films and this is one of the best art film that I watched. It was pretty hard for me to come down and go to bed late at night after this movie.
The movie was shot in single take. There is no editing and the camera was shot in steady cam all through the running time for 95 minutes.
There are actually two men who are introducing the scene which is taking place in the Hermitage Museum. It is winter time and the snow is all over the exterior. The museum contains the dancing room, the exhibition room, hallway. The place itself is so big and beautiful that it itself is another object that is like an actor for me.
The movie (some says it is a documentary but I don't see it that way) comes back and forth from the recent period to the 1800.
When the man with the black cloth and the other guy behind the camera enters the museum, for a long time, the camera shows the exhibition room.
A lot of things are happening ther. Showing beautiful pictures, and the black cloth guy talking about some pictures he sees, talking about some of the Russian history. But most of all, when this old woman appears and starts to dance with this black suite guy, the choreagraphy was so beautiful with the also beautiful music combined. It was so charming that I couldn't move at all.
Actually from the beginning, to be honest, I wanted to go to the bathroom but sine I realized that the movie is shot in one cut, I couldn't go for 95 minutes. Since I am a man that was possible.

There are a lot of moments that are memorable but first, there is this moment when young girls are wearing ancient clothes and running slowly though the hallway with their hands waving like a dancer. It was like an angel or like a swan.
That moment connects with the big room with a lot of yellow chandelier lights and a few girls wearing wigs and ancient clothes are very beautiful moments.

The other moment is taking place in this enormously big dancing room where thousands of people wearing really pretty dresses dancing, looking at the chamber orchestra playing. 1. The orchestra is playing real time. It was not fake or dubbed at the post production. 2. There are so many people dancing without any interruting other cupple.
That moment are so beautifully shot with the camera moving elegantly that I was like smiling the whole time.
This moment reminded of the director Michael Cimino. He is notorious showing dancing scene so long which is so boreing and ugly. From his movie <Heaven's Gate><The deer hunter> you can witness.
You can compare those moments with this film and you will find out how different it is and how beautiful this movie made the dancing shot.

The truely amazing moment from this picture was when thousand people are exiting the dencing room and walking through this endlessly long hallway. It was so beautifully shot and I felt like these people are blessed to be born that way. I know that this is just a movie and the people are just actors but i truely felt that they are nobleman and they are talking about their noble life and all. Then the narration is saying This are all like a dream.. That moment is truely memorable to me. Then comes the music. The beautiful flute sound. Some sad moment. Sad means all this beautiful moments are finished. They are going home. Now it's time to rap up.
When the camera is facing the exterior for the final moment and we see the wind blowing like crazy, the snow falling so harshly and along comes the last narration saying it's sad that you cannot go with me. The Russa have been came a long way.
It sure did. I love Tchaikovsky and many other artists from Russia and this movie is to be memorable forevery.
Thanks god that I saw this beautiful movie.",1455753600,,3723,4.424198250728863

7994650,5,B00009Z528,"Watching this film is an amazing experience! It is a visual feast; the soundtrack is lovely.
It is a work of art on many levels. It is shot in a single take which, simultaneously, winds through the fabulous art housed in the Hermitage, through the hundreds of years of history witnessed by the same building, through the soul of a nation trying to define its place in a rapidly-changing world. Though the movie is in Russian, the subtitles are more than adequate to get the sense of what is happening. Give this movie a chance. You won't regret it.",1404518400,,548,4.545454545454546
7994651,3,B00009Z528,"""Russian Ark"" is a film that takes place within the Winter Palace which houses the Hermitage Museum. The museum is in St. Petersburg, which is a large draw to Russian tourism. The viewer's perspective is through the eyes of a ghost that follows a foreigner. The narrator is a ghost because he had died in a tragic incident. This different approach to storytelling makes the film a bit difficult to follow.

""Russian Ark"" deals greatly with the history of Russian art, opera showings, and historical figures. Each piece and famous icon is from a different period, which gives the viewer a lot to take in. Though educational, this film is a bit complex in the way it presents all of the information.

During World War II, a nine hundred day siege took place in Russia. This event is illustrated in the movie in such a way that it may pique the viewer's interest. Leningrader, a historical figure, created a coffin for himself during the siege. This may pique the viewer's interest because it shows how threatening life in Russia really was. The act of building a coffin is an act done only when death is close on the horizon.

Katherine the Great is a female important more than any other to the history of Russia. She rules Russia during the time that operas presented in the film are taking place. These operas allow the viewer to be informed of Russian culture during her rule. The operas are very educational in terms of Russian theater and the way Russia existed under Katherine the Great.

This film is worth watching to be informed deeply of Russia in art, theater, culture, and Russian life through the centuries of history presented. However, the way the film jumps around in its storytelling makes it too difficult to appreciate fully. Each little part of the film is unique, but does not come together in a narrative easy to understand. The film is worth a second viewing because possible details missed in the first viewing could be picked up on. ""Russian Ark"" deserves a solid three stars out of five.",1398988800,,2012,4.691218130311615
7994652,5,B00009Z528,Amazing both from it's being a single uncut take and from the narrative constantly shifting between 18th century and the present. Climax is a dance in the main ballroom including 300 couples in period costumes.,1395446400,,210,5.0285714285714285
