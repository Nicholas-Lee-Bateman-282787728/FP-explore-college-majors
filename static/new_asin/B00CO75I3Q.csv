8583869,5,B00CO75I3Q,"I have watched over 200 Asian drama series over the years, mostly Korean, some Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese. Although I wouldn't say this particular drama was the best, it was definitely one of the top 25.

If you like spooky stories, this one will keep you glued to your TV or computer screen. The Korean actress who plays the role of the magistrate's vampire mother was perfectly cast. For she has a slightly weird look to her anyway, and did a competent scary acting job.",1501027200,,477,4.6117647058823525

8583871,5,B00CO75I3Q,"Great movie and good subtitles.  This is the second drama with this same main star,  and he did another fantastic job.  If you haven't seen "" Scholar Who Walks the Night"" with him, you have to see it, where he plays a vampire.",1472083200,,226,4.209302325581396
8583872,5,B00CO75I3Q,"This was my introduction to the fantastic actor, Lee Jun Ki. His ability to make you believe that he can't see or hear ""spirits"" is very convincing and the ability he has to express without verbalizing, just through using his eyes, facial expressions is fantastic. Needless to say, this drama ""hooked"" me into being a fan of Lee Jun Ki.",1443484800,,336,4.616666666666666
8583873,5,B00CO75I3Q,"Excellent! I love this drama. At first I thought it would just be a Ghost Comedy. Was I ever wrong. Very good story, excellent English subtitles, funny, intense, sad, hits just about every emotion. I will definitely recommend this drama to all my friends.",1391817600,6,255,4.818181818181818
8583874,5,B00CO75I3Q,"I really enjoyed this K-drama. Lots of good comic acting, interesting ghosts, scary demons, etc. The last episode was very good!  I had never seen Lee Joon Ki in any dramas before and became a big fan! He looked very handsome in his Magistrate uniform. I've heard he is a 3rd degree black belt in taekwondo and his fight scenes were great. I especially loved it when he used his demon-destroying fan. This was his comeback drama after leaving the military. I've also enjoyed his ""Iljimae"" and ""Two Weeks"" dramas.",1383264000,6,512,4.688888888888889
8583875,5,B00CO75I3Q,"Stumbled over this show after I finishing another great Kdrama ( The moon that embraces the sun). The actors/actresses are soooo talented and the show was entertaining from start to finish.

Arang ( a ghost unable to cross) has been roaming the earth for 3 years, successfully evading being captured by the Reapers who catch these ""rebel-ghosts""  to keep the balance between the world of the living and the afterlife.

By chance Arang runs into the new Magistrate (Sato) and discovers, that he has a rare gift : he can see and communicate with ghosts. So she ask for his help to uncover who she is, because she has no memory.

Since Arang is in possession of a hairpin Sato gave his mother before she disappeared, he reluctantly agrees to help Arang in hope to find his mother.

After a ""meeting"" with the Great Jade Emperor and Hades , they send  Arang back to earth (in human form) to solve her very own murder. Only then will she be allowed to enter heaven - the only other option is Hell....

This is just a great story and so fun to watch.  I was totally addicted and finished it in about 4 days.",1382745600,5,1101,4.415841584158416
8583876,5,B00CO75I3Q,"Li Jun Ki and Shin Min Ah are a perfect pair, and Li Jun Ki richly deserved the award he received for this role as Sato. The costuming and sets are beautiful, the evil fairy terrifying, and Ju Wal -- horrible, tragic, fascinating to watch. The score is terrific, though I don't like the rock music for the fight scenes, but the main theme and the eerie music box theme are both some of the best pieces you will hear in a KDrama. There are some cheap effects in the final episode -- maybe they ran out of money -- but for the most part, the supernatural portions are handled very well, with stellar performances from the Jade Emperor and his brother, and most notably, the Grim Reaper. Shin Min Ah has a beautiful story arc as her character, Arang, discovers the truth about her own death. There are quite a few really good KDramas: this has yet to be displaced from the top of my list.",1382659200,7,885,4.3053892215568865
