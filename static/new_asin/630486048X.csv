7878983,4,630486048X,"This tape has some of the best interveiws with ""The Man"" that I ever watched. The matches are pretty good(the match with Sgt. Slaughter is  excellent)There is a 30 minute match with Terry Taylor that best  illustrates the old NWA type matches that Flair is famous for. I gave it 4  stars instead of 5 because most of the matches are cut or joined in  progress & some of the footage is a bit fuzzy. Also too much interveiw  time is given to other wrestlers(i.e.the Garvins,Rick Morton,Dusty  Rhodes)All in all a good buy though,especially for Flair fans.",966297600,2,553,4.649484536082475
