8113510,5,B000ER1JHM,"This is a challenging story, directed by Stephen Johnson, which explores the difficulty of young Aboriginal men trying to find their identity. Botj, Milika and Lorrpu are three friends who deal with the challenges in their lives differently. They are caught between two worlds. The world that sees them breaking the law, lost souls in a 'white' world. To be Yolngu men is to be a proud, centred Aboriginal man, functioning in both worlds As the trailer says, 'three lives; two laws; one country.' Great casting, beautiful cinematography. a 'tragic' ending but overall the film includes a strong message about journeys of discovery.",1420416000,,631,5.135922330097087
8113511,5,B000ER1JHM,"This is one of the best Aboriginal movies I have seen. Whilst not a Oscar rating movie, it nonetheless shows Aboriginal people in Australia as they are. As a people it shows their struggle between white and black Australia and the conflict of the two cultures. A real educational experience!",1243814400,,291,4.84
8113512,3,B000ER1JHM,"This is an interesting movie about three Australian Aboriginal teenagers, from Arnhem Land, who are in trouble with the law. In an advanced capitalist society like Australia, their chances to succeed in life seems about nil. The movie is a kind of fantasy in which they become men by escaping civilization and fleeing to the wild, submerging themselves into the traditions of their culture and becoming hunters. This is great for them, but it's terrible for the local fauna, who gets a real beating from the boys (the scene where a huge turtle is killed by the teenagers leaves a particular bad taste). Of course, in real life, it's white people that have destroyed the environment around the world; aboriginal people tend to live in equilibrium with nature. Still, I found a bit troubling the equivalence of newly found self-respect with hunting.",1200355200,,847,4.971830985915493
8113513,4,B000ER1JHM,"A rare in-site into indigenous Australia better known worldwide recently for drinking, short life expectancy and pedophilia, romantically portraits natural beauty of pristine reservations and cultural mix of native ancient and modern Western cultures by following three teenagers in wildlife and urban jungles.

It is really nice work, educative both for foreigners and locally fed up city-skippers especially.",1183161600,2,410,6.068965517241379
