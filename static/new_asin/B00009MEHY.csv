This movie does not star Richard Basehart.  How many customers have to comment that this is the wrong movie before they fix it's listing.
Come on Amazon...get it right!",1390348800,,328,4.857142857142857
7991512,1,B00009MEHY,"BUYER BEWARE!! THIS DVD ""GREAT AMERICAN WESTERN VOL.12"" DOES NOT CONTAIN THE VERSIONS OF THE MOVIES AS ADVERTISED IN THE DESCRIPTION. ""THE SAVAGE GUNS"" IS NOT THE 1962 VERSION STARRING RICHARD BASEHART EVEN THOUGH THAT IS WHAT THE DISTRIBUTOR OF THIS DVD PUT ON THE CASE. IT IS A VIOLENT BADLY DUBBED WESTERN FROM PROBABLY THE 1970S. IT GETS WORSE! EVEN THOUGH THIS DVD IS PART OF THE ""GREAT AMERICAN WESTERN"" SERIES THE VERSION OF ""FIGHTING MAD"" ON THIS DVD IS NOT EVEN A WESTERN. IT IS A VIOLENT, MODERN DAY URBAN CRIME DRAMA!! IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT AFTER CUSTOMER RETURNS AND COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON.COM STILL MARKETS THIS DVD AND ANY OTHER DVD'S BY THIS DISTRIBUTOR.",1095897600,5,669,4.775862068965517
7991513,1,B00009MEHY,If you are buying this for the movie Savage Guns with Richard Basehart do NOT buy it! Even if it does say on the cover and on the DVD that this movie is on the DVD it is NOT on the DVD!  This is the only reason I bought it and it wasn't there!. On top of that when I returned it Amazon charged me a restocking fee and a return fee on top of the postage they charged me. I only got $1.59 back. So save your money! Pass this one by!,1073952000,4,430,3.6236559139784945
