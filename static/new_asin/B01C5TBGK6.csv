8752298,4,B01C5TBGK6,"All the episodes you love from season 1-3 of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" are included in this set. There are some bonus features for each season and the menus are nice to look at, borrowing from the LCARS interface used on the show. My only complaint is that there are so many discs (20 in this set) that the holder is not attached to the case, so you have to take the holder out to flip through them. All in all, this is a nice slim package for these seasons so you can own them all without taking up too much room on your shelf. The case itself is sturdy enough and the art, while simplistic, makes clear that this is an epic series that earned its place in television fame.",1483920000,,681,4.166666666666667
8752299,5,B01C5TBGK6,"Discs have not skipped or (paused) yet. I just hate that when you buy a new DVD and it craps out the 1st or 2nd time you watch it, especially when it has no scratches. Picture and quality seem to be good.",1475712000,,204,3.880952380952381
