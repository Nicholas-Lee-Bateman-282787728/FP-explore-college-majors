8297460,2,B001EAWM74,"This is really a compilation of people who talk of 'The Cure' and is a dated, slanted view of them. Their music although you would expect to be of The Cure is basically a cover band playing throughout this DVD. Disappointed,  as this proposes to be an insightful, behind the scene- in depth Cure  music and personal discovery, however it is merely other people's points of view of The Cure, unexciting Banshees experiences told about Robert Smith whilst touring, and covers of them playing songs that have similar sounding background music of them. DISSAPOINTING!",1387324800,5,563,4.9787234042553195
8297461,2,B001EAWM74,"First off the dvd opens with the disclaimer that it is unauthorized, only meaning The Cure had no part in making the dvd and there is absolutely no Cure music on the dvd.  If you are new to The Cure, and don't know anything about them, then this would be a good intro.  But as a Cure fan, this dvd provided me with absolutely no info that I did not already know.  There are only a few snippets of video where Robert Smith is at some press type conference anwering questions but that is it.  The majority of time is spent with some music producer, Brit DJ, and two other people, none of whom I know, commenting in The Cure, but none of them provide any new info or insights into the band or their music.  The only plus stuff on the dvd is the interview with Steve Severin from souxsie/banshees who talks about the time when the cure were touring (opening act) with the banshees and robert smith had to step in and also play guitar for the banshees, and Severin also talks about smith's guitar playing and ""The Glove"" album they did together.  The only other plus is some photos of robert smith and the band from the EARLY days. there is one early picture of robert smith with his make-up on and some silk scarf thing wrapped around his head and he honestly looked like Prince. Anyway, any money spent on Strange Museum would be better spent on The Cure ""Trilogy"" DVD by far.",1259020800,23,1373,4.3229571984435795
