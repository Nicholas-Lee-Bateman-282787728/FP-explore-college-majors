5414810,2,B00AF4OSW2,I really wish they would cheapen the rental prices of these low budget tv to dvd movies.  They are ok to watch but not worth 4.99 to view.,1365379200,,138,3.9285714285714284

5414812,2,B00AF4OSW2,"This review contains spoilers. However, if you are at all interested in this movie then you may be thankful to have read them.

I'm a horror nut, like quite a few SyFy originals, and adore the killer plant theme. Unfortunately, this is not ""one for eco-horror fans!"" This is more of a religious/political semi-thriller than anything else. The movie started out great, then it's as if the budget for digital effects ran out. It soon turns into a religious talky bore without the destruction. I was enjoying the movie until the tendrils came to Reno. They approach the city then instead of seeing any destruction the audience is shown a satellite image and the government officials say Reno is being devastated. The tease was like a punch in the gut. I then figured maybe the scenes of destruction would be saved for the climax. Nope. The tendrils reach Sacramento, the image shakes a bit while people run, then that's it.

The movie was shot well. The acting wasn't bad. The special effects were typical of a SyFy original. The beginning had plenty of action. All the pieces were in place for a good (for a SyFy original) movie. That is why it turned out to be such a monumental disappointment. How something like this could end up as a great looking Blu-ray (the image is nice and vibrant hovering around 25-30 Mbps) while ARACHNOQUAKE and PIRANHACONDA remain MIA in the US is a crime against horror fans.

Note: if you pick this up and think you can just sell it on Amazon if you don't like it, think again. Amazon has classified this as a restricted item. This is probably because they know the $20+ price they're asking is insane and no one would bite if sellers offered it for less.",1363478400,3,1686,4.59468438538206
5414813,2,B00AF4OSW2,"Overall the acting was pretty good. But let me say this that If you are looking for a movie that has lots of destruction then this movie isn't for you. There is hardly any violence any fighting not much more then that. The seeds really don't do much of any destruction except for damaging cars and tearing up the roads but that's it. I was expecting these seeds to kill more people and I expected to see more gore, there wasn't much of any gore at all. I hope that they don't make another film because I wouldn't buy it. The sounds were pretty good and the casting was ok. The picture quality was very good. The only thing that was good was the very beginning after that the film goes downhill. Three words save your money. Go buy the hobbit instead and watch it.",1363219200,6,763,4.268965517241379
5414814,1,B00AF4OSW2,"I know this was going to be a ""B"" movie going into it, but didn't realize just how bad it was going to be overall.  I have a liking to these type of movies as I enjoy background noise if I am needed to do stuff while watching.  But this one was painful!  The some of the things such as having a antidote in several minutes, being able to analyze dirt in seconds . I could go on but why.",1362268800,,386,3.8
5414815,2,B00AF4OSW2,"Interesting plot for a cheesy SciFi - if your desperate for some SciFi and you've seen everything else, this will provide a little relief.",1362182400,,138,4.791666666666667

5414840,3,B00AF4OSW2,It was exciting and interesting but not quite what I expected.  I think most Sci Fi fans would like it but it probably wouldn't be on the top of their list.,1388620800,,156,4.032258064516129

8550759,2,B00AF4OSW2,"This film, however, pitted blabbering Bible Bashers Against scientists who basically ""cured' pollution, famine, illness, injury (Unfortunately not idiocy, or the main characters wouldn't have been trying to DESTROY it), yet for some reason, became the proverbial bad guys, even though they weren't even responsible for the breath that created the issue in the first place (basically, if you watched Jurassic Park, and replaced the dinosaurs with giant veiny vines, you would pretty much be watching the same plot).

It was pretty infuriating to me that the government agents kept referring to the world being ridden of all pollution as ""destruction"" and they consider killing the plant life that is responsible for curing ALL OF EARTHS PROBLEMS as ""saving the planet from DISTRUCTION???
The mentality celebrated in this film is EXACTLY what got us into the polluted, disgusting situation we find ourselves in!",1518393600,,909,5.356643356643357
