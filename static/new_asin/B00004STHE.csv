7922006,5,B00004STHE,"So educational!  My son begs to watch it over and over again.  He quotes the movie all the time, and is very interested in sonic booms and volconology now!  Very impressive.",1392940800,,173,4.516129032258065
7922007,5,B00004STHE,"Provides advanced and detailed information about things that go ""boom"" in a cohesive presentation with explanations and demonstrations. Enjoyable live footage and child narrator. Great for science classes. Challenges kids to think. Most kids loved it, asking questions and counting along with the explosions. They loved seeing the action of a building demolition in reverse. ""It's cool. I liked watching the volcanoes and learning how the lava makes islands.""  ""Too much like school."" Best for ages 5 to 8.",1000425600,3,506,5.405063291139241
7922008,4,B00004STHE,I bought this video for my 3 1/2 yr old nephew because he was very interested in hot lava and volcanoes.  Its a very well made video and easy for kids to understand.  My nephew loved it and wanted to watch it again right away.  I think it would be good for a wide age range of kids (3-12?).,978134400,3,290,3.8813559322033897
