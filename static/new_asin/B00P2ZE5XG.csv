8686333,1,B00P2ZE5XG,"It started out promising despite the films low budget, but ended up quite laughable at the end. That the sister and her boyfriend could single handedly bring down the Evil operatives of the organ harvesting organization, without so much as a stun gun. If this was meant to be a serious film then the actors were just not strong enough to pull it off. We did enjoy the musical score however! Please enlighten if we missed something here???",1486166400,,438,4.628205128205129
8686334,5,B00P2ZE5XG,"While clearly made on a shoestring, Graders develops a suspenseful atmosphere that rivals big budget productions. The first half builds up the tension with a light and even touch which is not quite matched by the somewhat routine second half. The style of the main characters is spot-on and the score excellent, if only one could get the soundtrack.  Would recommend to any horror/Scottish/European fans.",1486080000,2,404,5.2153846153846155
8686335,5,B00P2ZE5XG,"Directoral debut for D Hutchison that got rave reviews in the Highland Film Festival. Stunning scenery of the highlands and Edinburgh. Strong cast, a really good low budget film coming out of Scotland and certainly one to watch for the future. Gritty in parts, plenty of humour with lots of twists and turns in the plot. I would recommend buying this as something different for your collection and showing to friends. Can`t wait to see what more this group will do.",1425686400,2,465,4.753086419753086
