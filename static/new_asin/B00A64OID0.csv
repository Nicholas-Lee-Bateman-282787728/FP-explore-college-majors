I practice Judo and BJJ and they complement each other because they both came from Jujutsu.(Correct spelling and prononciation). But my biggest problem with BJJ is they believe their techniques come directly from Jujutsu and not Judo. So my question to them is, ''why do your throwing techniques have Kodokan Judo names''. Before Prof. Jigoro Kano created Judo there were ''NOT'' any ''O'' or Big techniques. Futhermore a lot of these throws were created by Kano, Mifune, and others to make Judo safe for practice and competition. BJJ people selectively forget about Mitsuyo Maeda (Kodokan judoka) and his history of teaching the Gracies. And his domination of pro fighting in Brazil and around the world. For more info on Maeda please read ''The toughest man the ever lived'' by Nori Bunasawa and John Murray. And pay homage to were your art comes for.",1510272000,,988,4.886904761904762
