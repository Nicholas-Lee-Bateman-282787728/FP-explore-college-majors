8202312,2,B000RPYOWI,"Sklansky the Video definitely offers something most poker instructional seminars do not as viewers are privy to some autobiography concerning the master of EV himself. The interview conducted with Mr. Sklansky is fairly glowing but it also gives us a chance to hear his life story which I found intriguing. Perhaps my favorite part of the first video came when they panned over to Ted Forrest who did a short cameo. His appearance was absolutely hilarious. Even though no date is given, I'd say the timeframe was circa 1992. Forrest has a mullet and looks like a skinny cocky kid (which he probably was). As for the seminar, most of what Sklansky says here can be found elsewhere--particularly in his books; with the added bonus that his texts expound on these notions in far greater detail. I should note that this video certainly isn't a substitute for what one can get off the rack. Most of its allure has to do with our historical curiosity about ""The Don;"" a curiosity which in no way mitigates its hefty cost. Personally though, I don't think there's any reason to waste thirty bucks on something like this. That's an outrageous sum. If you can get a copy of it used and cheap then go ahead and do so, but I wouldn't waste cash on a new one. The money you'd spend can be better used in order to purchase two of Ed Miller's videos or a couple by Rolf Slotboom.",1166572800,6,1365,4.530364372469635
