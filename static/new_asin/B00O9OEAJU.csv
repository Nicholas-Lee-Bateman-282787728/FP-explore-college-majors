8682706,3,B00O9OEAJU,"I really enjoyed this workout the first time I did it but to be honest I have many workouts that are a lot better-this was a solid workout and yes I did sweat a lot but the moves were very basic-rows,squats,shoulder presses,eh-stuff I've done a zillion times before. I am a DVD fanatic and what makes a workout a keeper for me is learning moves that are different then what I've seen before. I like to challenge myself but also want to crave doing the workout again for the rush I felt after completing it. Maybe if I didn't have so many dvd's to choose from,I could've given this 5 stars. I just felt that there was nothing on this DVD that I haven't seen and done countless times. At least Scott was toned down in this one-I almost didn't purchase because of his annoyance factor in JNL Fusion",1428710400,,795,4.342281879194631
8682707,2,B00O9OEAJU,"It's an ok DVD. It is cut and pasted from their Youtube I guess? because they keep referencing comments and scrolls ""below"" and there is no below. the workouts are ok. Nothing that I didn't already have in other workout DVDs. If you want a quick 30 minute workout and don't already have anything else in your library, go for it.",1425600000,2,328,4.39344262295082
8682708,5,B00O9OEAJU,Great workouts!!,1423440000,,16,7.5
8682709,3,B00O9OEAJU,"This is not, by far the toughest workout you will ever do - I am an avid exerciser and I do Insanity, P90X, Tabata Training etc  That said, if you combine the 3 workouts, it's a challenge.  1 workout on it's own though, would not be a enough for advanced exercisers. Circuits are easy to follow, and the instructors are great, not too talkative, not screamers,",1422144000,4,360,4.4393939393939394
8682710,5,B00O9OEAJU,These workouts were designed to be INTENSE and give you the results you need without having to leave your home.

8682712,1,B00O9OEAJU,The workouts on this video have the same titles and approximate lengths as the videos on YouTube.  It looks like they are attempting to sell workout videos that are already freely provided on YouTube.,1415491200,8,200,4.882352941176471
