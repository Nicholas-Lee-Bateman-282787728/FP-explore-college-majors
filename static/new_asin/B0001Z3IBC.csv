2043601,1,B0001Z3IBC,"Well I am a collector of zombie movies and I do own some real stinkers such as Zombie Lake, Revenge of the Dead, to name a few, but boy this one was a huge disappointement.  All of the other reviews are true, it is so bad you will find yoursef hitting the chapter skip button.  I knew not to expect much going into it, but I didn't think it would be this horrible.  If you are looking for zombies, you will not find satisfactions here.  There are a few scenes where you see these ultra lame zombie wannabes, very weak.  If you get the unrated edition and want it for the porn you will find a lot, but you will find yourself getting tired of it quick.  There are so many porn scenes that it seems they were just trying to add them in, made me lose interest in the movie immedeately as it got old.  I would not recommend buying this.  Buy something else and steer clear off of this one.",1156982400,4,884,4.098837209302325
2043602,5,B0001Z3IBC,"First things first......this is a Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) Zombie Classic. Any one who is a Joe D'Amato fan knows that in all of his films with an exception of a few the he mixes Sex and Horror together. So don't by his movies if you do not like movies like this.

A hotel developer purchases a cursed tropical island where he plans to build a luxury resort. Arriving on the god-forsaken island he finds opposition in the worm infested, flesh eating, walking corpses as they begin to rise from their graves.

Exotic Laura Gemser (BLACK EMANUELLE, EMANUELLE AND THE CANNIBALS, VIOLENCE IN A WOMAN'S PRISON) plays a sexy and mysterious apparition, who warns of grave danger! Among the rarest of all zombie/cannibal/sex films, this Joe D'Amato masterwork is full of gore, steamy eroticism, and an apocalyptic cannibal-zombie climax flesh feast you won't soon forget!

Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) was born on December 15, 1936, in Rome and died in Rome, Italy because of a heart attack. The last film that D'Amato was working on was a movie called PLANKTON (1995). That was supposed to be about a group of young divers become infected with a 'virus' which results in rape and bloody mayhem.

Erotic Nights of the Living Dead (Sexy Night of the Living Dead) originally was supposed to be a strait forward Horror film. But the producer told Joe to put the Sex, Orgasms, threesomes in there to spice it up.

Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is an Erotic Horror film. It even states tat on the back of the box. If you don't like the version with all the Sex, Orgasms, threesomes then just buy the Cut version also by Shriek Show.

If you liked this title then you will like Joe D'Amato's (Aristide Massaccesi)other Zombie Horror Classic, PORNO HOLOCAUST also released by Shriek Show/Media Blasters under their Expliotation label company Expliotation Digital. It is the infamous sleaze/horror 'classic' from Joe D'Amato. That Stars infamous cast of EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD; George Eastman, Dirce Funari, Lucia Ramirez and Mark Shannon, join Annj Goren (Unleashed Perversions of Emanuelle, Black Orgasm) in this notorious Italian cult shocker!

In Porno Holocaust, A group of scientists visit a deserted island to search for a native who's reportedly been exposed to nuclear fallout. Unaware that a sex-crazed, cannibalistic, radioactive monster walks among them they are stalked and attacked by the, zombie mutant. This insatiable creature explicitly rapes and then disembowels the females, who die horrible deaths after being inseminated with its radioactive sperm.

This is one of Joe D'Amato's strangest, wildest, and sleaziest films!",1155945600,5,2652,5.080459770114943
2043603,5,B0001Z3IBC,"NUDITY!!!We get hardcore oral male and female, penatration, the whole deal. The sex is even with one of the main charators not some spliced in porn. We get lots of naked Laura, and some other girl that spends pretty much the whole move in a bikini, topless, and even a fair amount of time bottom less, and several other full frontal nude girls. Also a girl has sex with a champagne bottle, real penatration, and the bottle pops its cork inside her, bubbles spill from her bush! It was strange to see hardcore full blown sex and then simulated softcore sex back to back. The sftcore seemed so tame after the hardcore.

The zombie stuff is fairly weak but still entertaining. The movie had a cool feel to it. I liked the boating, the seduction on the boat, the remote island.

I know alot of viewers are critical of this movie, but it is insanely original and there is nothing like it. That alone is worth something, besides all the sex and nudity. By itself you could give it 2 stars, but compare it other movies and its easily 5 star.",1150329600,39,1034,4.408376963350785
2043604,3,B0001Z3IBC,"Vampires have often been portrayed as seductive and sexy.  Even werewolves are getting their day in the romance novels.  But erotic zombies?  Not really.  The zombies here are not portrayed in any erotic manner, other than Laura Gemser lending her presence to the scene.  Instead, the uncensored sex is provided by a hotel executive scouting a location to build a hotel.  For some unknown reason he has chosen a remote island that seems to be completely covered in burial grounds.  Laura Gemser is on the side of the interned.  So what happens when capitalism tries to clash with the dead and buried?  The dead become restless.

What follows is rather typical of the low budget zombie films.  The island becomes overrun with hundreds of zombies pushing up through the dirt to take their revenge on the living.  The film could have used a little more plot to tie it together so we would know why the site was picked, that the developers knew about the graves but disregarded them, etc. but we don't get that.  What we do wind up with is the sexy Laura Gemser, a bit of explicit sex, and lots of walking corpses.  Actually, not so bad for a low-budget zombie film.

If you are of fan of the low-budget zombie genre (you know who you are) then you will probably get a kick out of this film.  If you are interested in seeing a hardcore epic that happens to include zombies, then you will be disappointed by the brief, though explicit, footage.  If you know what you are hoping to find then you will know if this one is for you.",1149552000,2,1523,4.48
2043605,3,B0001Z3IBC,"Proliffic porn and horror director Joe D Amato attempts to tackle two popular genres that many other Italian directors have tried to cash in on during their success in the late 70's and early 80's which were the beloved genre's of zombie horror flicks and Porn.  In essence, you would think by mixing the two, you would have yourself a great movie.  But Erotic Nights of the Living Dead falls short as both a porn flick and a zombie movie.  But what it does accomplish, is the status of a truly great pizza and beer with buddies movie.  So if you're into truly and laughably bad movies with bad acting, bad dubbing, bad music, bad plot and mediocore effects, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead may be up your next Mystery Science Theater 3000 project.  I will say that the zombies are very Fulci in design and there are a few good gory moments here and there.  But otherwise avoid unless you are a zombie completist or a truly sadist cinephile like myself.",1119916800,7,954,4.485549132947977
2043606,2,B0001Z3IBC,"I may not be the quintessential purveyor of Euro-Horror, but I have seen enough to know that I have seen one of of the worst in ""Erotic Nights of the Living Dead!"" That is not to say that this film is entirely uninteresting.

If money is no object, or you can pick this DVD up for a song, then the combination of eye candy, bad special effects and hysterical dubbing (anybody remember SCTV's ""Rome, Italian Style"" spoof from years ago? Dubbing wise, this is the real thing!)make this zombie movie fun to watch...for awhile. Cinema this bad can only last so long until you grab your DVD remote and speed up the process, or go to the main menu for the special features.

You have two men and a woman head out to ""Cat Island,"" where zombies are purported to live. These folks don't believe the folktales, meet up with the only two inhabitants of the grave-riddled island (an elderly man with a boil on his forehead and his sultry granddaughter, played by Euro-Siren Laura Gemser), who warn the visitors to leave and... well, y'know.

What I found most shocking about the film was that the restored hardcore sex scenes advertised on the package were actually hardcore sex scenes, available in shops that refuse to sell XXX action. Now--- if this is the part you're curious about, it's only one hardcore scene, and probably tame compared to the other XXX you've seen. You get lots of soft-core, lots of beautiful women romping naked, but nothing worth shelling out hard cash for.

As for the Euro-Horror zombie flesh-chomping scenes, they are far and few between, and amongst the worst you will ever see!

The special features? The alternate scenes and the Laura Gemser gallery is so lame, you would swear the folks producing this DVD wanted to outdo the mediocrity of the film itself. The one good special feature is the trailers for other Euro-Horror films.",1095552000,60,1854,4.6923076923076925
2043607,3,B0001Z3IBC,"Oh good lord what can I say about this one.  With Laura Gemser starring and Joe D'amato directing, this film feels like a lost entry in the Black Emmanuelle series, but in this one she plays a voodoo girl who keeps staring off the beach of Cat Island. Do not take this as a bad thing as D'Amato's camera loves Gemser and perhaps in this film it is apparent more than their others.  George Eastman of 'Baba Yaga' stars in this one as a boat captain who is hired by this skeezy oversexed (you betcha!!) lawyer type to take him to the forbidden island with his tramp dujour.  So Eastman (apparently still a Name in the cast because he gets to have all his sex with his clothes on) takes them out there where the living dead attack them.  Okay, the zombies don't get as much screen time as the naked chicks, but with this kind of acting, like, who can tell the difference.  Combining the hardcore market and the gutmuncher market is honestly one of the most misguided ideas in the history of film, so this one gets three stars just for being a carwreck of a film that you just know you have to slow down for.  I will never look at a champagne bottle the same way again, and, like Jay Slater said in his book Eaten Alive, I could only wonder what had happened to the cork... The photography of the sex scenes leaves me with one lingering query:  What would D'amato have achieved in the hardcore scene if he hadn't been so misogynistic? Also kudos to the overdubbing dept.--they  didn't even match the cat's yowling with it's mouth!!",1088553600,25,1527,4.371024734982332
2043611,1,B0001Z3IBC,"Ok ok we get it. It's a porno that has a few zombie clips in it. I was expecting human on zombie sex, but noooo... it was just plain as a bag of woodpeckers. Speaking of which, there was just too many close-ups of the male genitals. WE GET IT! They are having sex.

2043612,1,B0001Z3IBC,"I bought this for my husband who owns just about every single ""zombie"" movie there is.  This was a total waste of time and DVD disc material.  I should have known by the title that it would be!",1305676800,,193,4.052631578947368
2043613,3,B0001Z3IBC,"This movie has divided fans of Joe D'Amato, horror, zombies and sexploitation for decades now, and there's good reason for it. The first part of the film is a straight up porno film indicative of almost all Europorn of its day. The latter part is a tepid horror film about the resurrection of the living dead on a tropical island, and even creates a further rift among horror aficionados and zombie freaks about whether the island's inhabitants are just garden variety plain old undead or the upper elitist echelon, the zombie nation (zombie fans take their zombie worship very seriously, I might add). And, in between, there's just your average, standard travelogue exploitation we've seen hundreds of times before.

There's no set up, no introductory plot, just bad music, bad acting, bad editing and lots of 'coitus interuptus', as none of the sex is finished - in the middle of each scene, the scissor edits kick in, and we're whisked away to someplace we didn't wish to be...so as porn, it's almost a failure, but not quite.  As horror, it's pretty much a dud until the last 20 minutes when the zombies/undead begin to rise from the sandy soil of their gravesites (which is rather cool, I will add), so it leaves much to be desired there as well.
It uses most of the same cast and scenery locations from a similar film of D'Amato's, 'Porno Holocaust', which was filmed at or around the same time, which I think I preferred to this one - 'can't be sure 'till I suffer through it again (I'm a closet cine-masochist, I guess).

As far as Laura Gemser goes, aside from a brief glimpse of her 35 minutes into the film, we don't get to see her form or hear her speak till 50 minutes into the island undead saga, so she shouldn't be billed as the star of this flick. She barely gets any screen time, and unveils herself to us only once that I can remember, so it's a total disappointment there. Huge bummer...if you're grabbing this for her presence, think twice.

So what we're left with is yet another flick D'Amato didn't have his heart or head in, a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a horror flick or a sexploitation-porn film, and ultimately ends up as not much of either. It is a curious oddity for those who have a weakness for such things, myself included, so you'll have to decide for yourself based on these disclosures whether you want to spend an `Erotic Night of the Living Dead'. It might just kill ya...",1284336000,3,2430,4.541095890410959
2043614,1,B0001Z3IBC,This movie was cheesy and awful but funny.  It had some really gross sex scenes with this guy and he had bumps on his balls.  Really great quality though with the filming.  It didn't look as old as it is.  But yeah it was pretty bad.,1212278400,,233,4.0
2043615,2,B0001Z3IBC,"If there was as much zombie action in this movie as there was sex, this movie would be great!

1) ACTING: The acting was difficult to tell as the voices of the actors were dubbed. No one ""appeared"" to be a bad actor.

2) PRODUCTION: The movie was pretty good when it came to production values. There were a few lighting issues, but nothing too distracting. Not a whole lot of blood and gore in this movie. There is a scene that is pretty violently graphic, and then later, one of our heroes is being eaten by the zombies. The soundtrack wasn't bad, and the eerie organ music heightened the creepiness of the island. The old man and the girl on the island were never explained, but I'm guessing they were ghosts, even though the girl did get it on with both Larry, John AND Fiona.

3) ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one are definitely ""Romero shamblers,"" even though where Romero's had problems walking, these were very steady in their pace. These zombies were very reminiscent of the Templar Knights movies, right down to the robes. They were in advanced stages of ""rot,"" and varied from grotesque maggot covered peeling skin to simple gray faces with darkened eyes. They walked INCREDIBLY slow and weren't difficult to destroy. They did enjoy eating their victims.

4) THE CAUSE: No specific cause was given. The island suffered an earthquake, then an un-named epidemic, and there seemed to be some black magic and rituals involved as well.

5) NUDITY: There was SO much nudity and graphic sex in this movie, it was almost like watching a horror themed soft core porn movie. There was one hardcore scene (complete with money shot) and I wonder if all the sex was taken out of this movie, if it would be 40 minutes long! There also is an interesting champagne bottle scene that must be seen to be believed. (37 minutes in)

This movie was pretty much ""okay,"" although it is a number of years old. Other than the sex, it is really mild for an Italian horror movie. Normally, there is blood galore, but not here. I wonder if the director purposely did this, and then filled the rest of the movie with lots of nudity and sex. I wouldn't recommend buying it, as after one viewing, you'll probably not need to (or want to) see it again. But, I don't really think there is anywhere around that this would be on a video store's rental shelf.

RATING: 2 out of 5",1197158400,2,2352,4.507042253521127
2043616,4,B0001Z3IBC,"So the others on here seem to love or hate this movie.
I say watch the first 10 minutes(to establish plot points) and then skip to where they reach the island. With that you have a great movie. As much as I like porn, I think the hardcore and character development is what bogs the film down. If you jump to them arriving at the island this is a good italian style zombie flick with some great imagery. And of course, LAURA!

I haven't seen it, but this might be a case where the rated version is the better bet. Too much of a film can be a bad idea. Things are often cut for a reason.",1196985600,,585,4.0

2043618,5,B0001Z3IBC,"Erotic Nights of the Living Dead aka Sexy Nights of the Living Dead (if you get the uncut version). Came out in 1980 and was filmed back to back with many other Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) classics like Porno Holocaust, Hard Sensations, and Porno Esotic Love. Erotic Nights of the Living Dead  starred many Joe D'Amato originals (who are also all in the other three films above), Laura Gemser (Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals), George Eastman (Antropophagus), Dirce Funari (Unleashed Perversions of Emanuelle), Lucia Ramirez (Blue Paradise), and Mark Shannon (Emanuelle in the Country).

Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) did the Cinematography as well for the film. The script was written by actor George Eastman. Erotic Nights of the Living Dead in my mind was a very good film. it had violence, blood, gore, sex, and hard core penetration scenes. This is a most have for any Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) fan or any one who likes zombie movie movies.

Special features for Erotic Nights of the Living Dead include:
Uncut Uncensored XXX Footage Restored!
Erotic Sunny Afternoons of the Living Dead (Alternate Footage)
Production Stills and a HOT and Steamy Laura Gemser Gallery!
Original Theatrical Trailer for the Movie!

Plot Line of the Movie: A hotel developer purchases a cursed tropical island where he plans to erect a luxury resort. Arriving on the god-forsaken island he finds opposition in the worm infested, flesh eating, walking corpses as they begin to rise from their graves.

2043620,3,B0001Z3IBC,"joe damatos erotic nights of the living dead is another one of those italian trashy exploitation zombie flicks that while quite enjoyable is still flawed. the film is about a hotel tycoon who wants to build a new hotel on a carribean island. the island just so happens to be filled with walking corpses who don't want their home to be used for the hotels. as you can probably guess by now, the hotel guy and his group soon fall prey to the zombies. erotic nights isn't all that bad if you enjoy cheesey italian films but everyone else should beware. the film is very cheesy and the acting, special effects, dubbing and overall look of the film is pretty low quality. also the film is pretty boring and dull until the final zombie attack at the end. leading up to that part we have an un-erotic hardcore sex scene and a few cheesy simulated scenes. if your patient through the tedious sex than you will enjoy the films zombie filled climax. a good film for fans of italian horror, just don't expect the best of the genre.",1170806400,2,1020,4.430851063829787

8018536,5,B0001Z3IBC,"Being a fan of Joe D' Amato, I think this is one of his best films. It's also one of my personal favorites that I've watched many times. The problem with this film, I think,  is that the cool cover art and title will probably deceive people into thinking that it's something along the lines of Fulci's ZOMBIE, BURIAL GROUND, and other zombie gore films. This isn't a gore movie, so it isn't recommended if you are searching for a typical zombie film that's loaded with violence and gore. In fact, it probably has one of the lowest body counts in a zombie film. With a body count of 3, it'll surely disappoint many. Aside from the zombies killing those 3 people, you get to see some ooze from the zombies towards the end. When a guy is trying to kill the corpses, he gouges out ones eyes, decapitates another and impales another one with some ooze instead of blood spilling from the zombies. There's also some bloodless gunshot hits, and there's one cheap shotgun blast to a zombies face. A good but dimly lit scene when Gemser bites a guys manhood off is cool, and this is followed by a quick gut munching scene that isn't extreme or graphic. The other 2 people that the zombies kill consist of some biting. There's no extreme gore in the movie; however I still think it's highly underrated. I liked the macabre story about a group traveling to a place that they call ""Cat Island."" The Island is deserted except for Gemser, an old man, and a mysterious black cat. The cat, apparently, might be the leader of the zombies. There's a good scene towards the climax that involves a medallion that's thrown to the ground that was done without CGI effects; I guess some may think it's a quick jump scare. The film has some hardcore masturbation shots, a hardcore threesome, and another porn shot involving a champagne bottle. It's loaded with full nudity from really good looking women, has excellent soundtracks and scenery, and the quality of the atmosphere on the island is good. The superb soundtracks, in my opinion, really carry the film. However, despite how much I like the film, many others will just be bored. It's slow in many parts, and once they get to the island, there's a lot of scenes of you just looking at the place. Since I like D' Amato's directing style, I thought the directing was excellent, and I also liked the cloaked walking corpses. There's also a really ugly maggot faced zombie on an autopsy table that is worth mentioning. It's a great grindhouse classic, but it won't appeal to many and isn't for most mainstream horror fans.

There's an extra that shows daytime scenes of some of the night scenes; these parts were shot during the day and darkened for the actual film to make it look like it was shot at night. The photo gallery is good, and I thought the DVD quality is excellent. Shriek Show released 2 DVD versions of this film.

8018543,2,B0001Z3IBC,Italian zombie movies from the 80s all had a tendency to go to extremes. The success of Lucio Fulchi's Zombie (aka Zombi 2 aka Zombie Flesh Eaters)opened the floodgates. Extreme gore was the number one draw of these films. Erotic Nights attempts to add what can only be called softcore porn to the mix. Graphic sex and violence doesn't mix at all.

Compared with the previous release by Shriek Show, this one labeled as ""Explicit uncut version"" has more complete scenes with porn in them. Most notably, the initial scene with a trio in the bathroom and then in bed, the dancer with the champagne bottle (well achieved), and the women's revenge ""cutting"" scene. I noticed an interesting pattern in which as the movie progress sex scenes tend to decrease while zombie gory scenes tend to increase.
