Would recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction and adventure.",1361836800,3,172,4.931034482758621

3675723,5,B001KZVQK2,"For years now I've hoped that they would reunite the cast, and continue this series. While I own the original box sets for all the seasons I am open to double dipping, and buying new editions of my favorite series but come on guys give us something extra! Like all studios like to do these days they are double dipping themselves with another release of this cult favorite Fox created series.

Like I said I would be happy to pay up some money to get it had they added anything worth while for the die hard fans. It's sad that from the looks of this it's almost a bare bones release they just took the first two seasons, and split them up.

I doubt this will ever get a Blu Ray release but if it does I hope they add some special behind the scenes or anything which would make me want to fork over more money for them!!! I mean give me something...

The show gets 5 Stars the package of the new sets gets a nice 3 Stars, and that's mostly because NO EXTRAS!!!

While we are at it! Why don't we re unite this cast, and bring back Sliders? I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!",1354060800,5,1058,4.121359223300971
8316670,2,B001KZVQK2,"I remember liking it better years ago; now I just find O'Connell immature and a poor actor (he really hasn't changed much over the years.  Maybe that's why he's basically stayed on TV instead of in movies).  Possibly the flaws are because of poor directing?

The plot had promise but was not well executed. The girlfriend I have never seen more recently and maybe because she isn't very good?  The only one that is a good actor is John Rhys-Davies; he is versatile and has been in many shows and movies.",1492560000,,503,4.4945054945054945
8316671,5,B001KZVQK2,I used to watch the Sliders on TV back in the day. Its a great SciFi series. You won't be happy until you buy all the seasons.,1484265600,,126,3.7037037037037037

8316678,5,B001KZVQK2,"talk about a GREAT SHOW. i love sliders. its just the show of shows. its soooooooooo different its good. the first seasons is one of the best. u go on such a great adventure with a cast u will fall in love with. it really makes u wonder what if history would have been different. season 1 is a bit more comedic but has a serious tone too, but tons of laughs. which is great, cuz it captures how real people would deal going to a new earth.  buy this now.",1415664000,3,454,3.989010989010989
8316679,5,B001KZVQK2,Season 1 of sliders was the best season of series. I mean the pilot was the best episode. Now everyweek when the tv show was on i would tape them. But when syfy had didn't even watch them being that they had them on so early. Plus there version sucked and thats what killed this show so i have no idea why it was cancelled on Fox i mean i thought the show was awesome especially season 1.,1410998400,2,388,3.9871794871794872
