3962907,5,B002OOWLPM,"I was so happy to have bought Season 3 and 4 of The Donna Reed Show. I think Season 3,4 & 5 were the best. The Season 4 opener with James Darren is my favorite. It featured him singing Goodbye Cruel World and it had a storyline that involved Shelley Fabares having a huge crush on him. Season 5 is also very important to the seris becuase this would be the last year she would appear as a full time cast member. By this time she was all grown up and the storylines would be adjusted t show what a lovely young woman she had become. Iwas a little disappointed by the scree time she had in season 4 compared to the other cast members. It will probably be more of the same for Season 5 because of her moving out to go to college. The other cast members are all good and they all have great chemistry. I look forward to seeing all the episodes for Season 5. My two favorites of Season 5 showcase Shelley's beauty: ""The New Look"" & Where the Stones Are"" are must see episodes if you are a fan of Shelley. She did make three more guest appearances in the last three seasons.",1349568000,6,1068,4.114832535885167
3962908,5,B002OOWLPM,I just pre-ordered my copy. I am looking forward to finally owning Season 5. I hope the remaining 3 seasons will be released as well.,1349395200,,133,4.36
3962909,5,B002OOWLPM,"Just a quick ""Yippee!"" that season five of the Donna Reed Show will be here on December 4th of this year! Just like last year with season 4, this is a wonderful Christmas gift to the fans! I just pre-ordered my copy!!",1349136000,3,217,4.190476190476191
3962910,5,B002OOWLPM,"With daughter Mary gone off to college, Donna Reed wanted this Season 5 to be the end of The Donna Reed Show. In the Spring of 1963, near the season's end, Donna decided that the work schedule was too long and felt Shelley Fabares' absence would be noticeably missed by audiences, and that the show would drop in the ratings. Luckily for us Donna Reed Show fans, ABC executives felt differently about the show and offered Donna the most lucrative contract that she couldn't turn down. Donna Reed accepted the contract which gave her less episodes per season, meaning a shorter work schedule, which is something she really wanted. Donna was also given a fantastic salary and more creative power over the show's episodes as well. The ABC executives were right in seeing The Donna Reed Show as still being very popular, even with Shelley Fabares' absence, as renewing Donna Reed's contract actually kept the ever-popular Donna Reed Show going on for another 3 seasons.

ABC executives replaced daughter Mary Stone with a new little daughter for Alex and Donna- Trisha. Trisha is an orphan who follows the Stone family home from the park, where she watches them and decides she wants to be a part of their family. Trisha's Uncle can see how much the Stone's love his niece, and let's them legally adopt her. Trisha is real life sister to Paul Petersen- Patty Petersen. In the 60's, I recall seeing these shows as a little girl, and couldn't help but wonder what are the odds of the Stone family finding a new daughter who is the spitting image of their son Jeff. When I got older and found out they were real life brother and sister, I knew I already knew that as a little girl, as what are the odds of finding a girl who looks more like son Jeff than his own sister Mary? That part of the show was always something to think about as a viewer back then. Daughter Mary (Shelley Fabares) still made a few shows this season, so she wasn't completely missed, and new daughter Trisha was so popular, she continued on until the last Season 8.

Besides a new contract and new daughter for The Donna Reed Show in 1963, the Stone family get new next door neighbors as well. Alex's colleague Dr. Dave Kelsey and his wife Midge find living with in-laws is too suffocating and buy the house next door to the Stone's. Dr. Dave Kelsey played by Bob Crane would be their neighbor until he got his own show Hogan's Heroes in 1965, remaining with the show through seasons 6 and 7. His wife Midge, played by Ann McCrea, would become Donna's best friend, and Midge would remain with the show until the end through season 8, even with the absence of husband Dr. Dave missing in the last season. With new neighbors Dr. Dave Kelsey and wife Midge, a new adopted daughter Trisha, a new contract for Donna Reed and college daughter Mary still in a few episodes, new life came into the show this Season 5 and it's popularity was as high as ever. On March 5, 1963, Donna Reed was awarded The Golden Globe Award for The Best TV Star- Female, showing that ABC executives were right in knowing to talk Donna Reed into not ending the show this season 5 and to go on yet another 3 seasons.

The show as always, had some great guest stars this season, featuring Harvey Korman, Candy Moore, Paul Winchell, Tony Owen Jr. (Donna Reed's real life son), Bob Crane, Doodles Weaver, Ann McCrea, Don Drysdale and wife Ginger Drysdale and more. In Episode 6, My Dad, son Jeff sings his hit song to dad Alex titled My Dad. This song was a hit, not on the level as Shelley Fabares' mega hit from last Season 4 Johnny Angel, but Paul Petersen fans loved it, and you will too! Shelley Fabares also sings her B-Side song BIG STAR (A-Side was her Colpix hit TELEPHONE-Won't You Ring?)in Episode 9 titled Big Star. As always, MPI, who include fantastic extra's get a HUGE THANK YOU!, as does the Estate Of Donna Reed, and her wonderful daughter Mary Owen and son Tony Owen Jr., who work tirelessly to get the rights to their mother's shows and put them on dvd for us fans. THANK YOU A MILLION MPI and especially Donna's children!!! This Season 5's Extra Bonus features are worth their weight in gold- NEW conversations with Paul and sister Patty Petersen!!!! You will not want to miss the wonderful stories Paul and Patty tell of working with the cast and crew of this season!!! I hope we get to hear more from Paul, Shelley (was on an earlier season talking with Paul) and Patty on future dvd's!!! Their stories are just wonderful and heartwarming!(And I'm keeping all my fingers crossed for the Estate Of Donna Reed to acquire the rights to give us fans the remainder of the shows Seasons 6, 7 and 8!)

3962913,5,B002OOWLPM,"I have all four of the seasons and can't wait for the others.  Please do not stop at five.  I especially want to see the latter episodes.  I was going through my teen years when The Donna Reed Show was airing.  Best years of our lives.  Not because we were teens.  But because that was a good era to live.  Life was simpler and a family could watch a program on tv and not be embarased.  Jeff (Paul Peterson) reminds me so much of my grandson who is fifteen now--tall, handsome and loves to sing.  He also plays football and enjoys life the way Jeff did on the show.  Please continue to make these episodes available and thanks for the ones that have been made.

Like a lot of others, I was extremely disappointed when Donna Reed Show stopped at Season 3.  I grew up with this show and My Three Sons.  The rumor is that MPI Video is picking up Season 4 and 5 of the Donna Reed Show!  Just saw this in print on the internet.",1297555200,5,442,3.8777777777777778
3962915,5,B002OOWLPM,"I have been fortunate enough to have already seen and viewed Seasons 1 & 2.  Our local library has gotten them for me and the other patrons.  I feel that this sitcom was by far the very best when I was growing up in the 50's and 60's.  I can hardly wait for you to notify me on the release of 4 & 5.  The library has already ordered Season 3 for me.

Thank you so much for offering this to us.  Being that most of the Seasons are B&W, doesn't matter to me at all.  It brings back so many fond memories, and I love them all.

Please notify me immediately when 4 and 5 are to be released, as I may order a personal copy as well as ask our library to get one.

Television series just are not like those Donna Reed Series anymore.  All we get now is violence, blood, and sex.  It is so nice to really relive my childhood.  I am sure that many other people in my age group feel the same way.

Thank you,

Donna Reed show was never played in reruns much either, except for a stint on Nick at Night some years ago. Donna was a fine actress and is missed. Stories depict the trials and tribulations of a family that is well off, with some touching episodes. Anyone under 30 probably never saw this show, and is a  cut above Leave it to Beaver for its realism, and a cut below Father Knows Best.",1449273600,2,465,4.406976744186046

Donna is my favorite character and with the exception of  ""Mrs. Stone & Dr. Hyde"", ""Rebel with a Cause"", ""The House on the Hill"", and a few others, her role has become less central than in previous seasons with increasing storylines for the now teenage kids and their lives. While I'm not enthusiastic about less Donna, the episodes in which she is the central focus are some of my favorites of the series (seasons 1-5), thus the 5 star review.",1446940800,2,482,4.540229885057471

3962958,4,B002OOWLPM,"A long time Donna Reed Show fan I gave season 5 only 4 stars.
Positives: I liked Jeff's maturing role as he moves from little boy antics to trying to figure out the complexities of high school romance and other teen troubles. In this season Paul Petersen's (Jeff Stone) real life sister 8 year old Patricia joins the Stone family as their adopted daughter Trisha. (Those who have been through adoption will be waiting for the adoption process to play out, but it doesn't. Trisha is adopted in one episode without any sign of paperwork! (: Still a cute addition.) Trisha disappears for a few episodes and plays more of a background part overall but still adds something to the family.
Negatives: My only disappointment in this season is Mary's character. For a girl going off to college she seemed to be more immature than the previous season. And her somewhat snotty big sister attitude seems even worse now that Jeff's character is more mature.

Additional information: This season does include 2 songs ""My Dad"" by Paul Petersen and ""Big Star"" by Shelley Fabares. There are also guest appears by: Harvey Korman, Bob Crane, Harold Gould, Jimmy Hawkins, Don Drysdale, Paul Winchell, Jim Davis, James Stacey, Hayden Rorke, Janet Langard, and Richard Deacon",1431993600,2,1254,4.887323943661972

3963014,4,B002OOWLPM,"I liked this season. It is fun to watch the kids
grow up. I do think that  the show it is getting
to be more silly, trying to stay up with the times.
I think the first 4 seasons were more serious,
teaching moral lessons.",1360972800,2,220,3.888888888888889

I also bought this dvd set for the Cheryl Holdridge episode(she is one of my favorites).

3963027,5,B002OOWLPM,"The Donna Reed Show is my all time favorite family sitcom. I enjoyed season 5 immensely, especially the show with Paul Petersen singing ""My Dad.""  Shelley Fabares wasn't in all of the episodes and I missed her. However, all of the actors who play the Stone family are believable, likeable and interesting. Sure, The Donna Reed Show wasn't completely realistic, but isn't that what TV is for? I have seasons 1-5 and I will watch them again.",1358812800,2,439,4.701298701298701

3963032,4,B002OOWLPM,"I used to watch Donna back in the good ole days of Nick at Nite so it is great to see these episodes again. The only complaint I have is the addition of Trisha. She was unnecessary and unwanted esp since Patty Peterson could not act and was more of an annoyance than anything else. I did like the addition of Dave and Midge Kelsey at the beginning of disc 5; I guess I'll have to wait until season 6 to see more of them, they are only in one episode. The funniest episode was the one where Clovis was following Mary everywhere and the havoc that caused. I also liked the house on the hill where Donna went to try to get an old woman to donate to charity and she was held against her will. I couldn't stand the Doddles Weaver episode, I'm sorry but he was just not funny. But overall this is a wonderful show, Donna Reed was never given the props she truly deserved. I give it 4 stars only because of the Trish character, if she hadn't come on board, I would give it 5 stars.",1355011200,5,974,4.078125

3963034,5,B002OOWLPM,"I am very excited about this 'Season 5' release! The episodes are top notch. For example, ""The Chinese Horse"" which is a great Mystery Episode. And the ""House on the Hill"" episode, with Donna being held against her will. ""The Big Wheel"" episode, with the large bus stuck in front of the Stone's House. The ""My Dad"" episode where Paul Petersen performs his hit song, ""My Dad"" that is still popular today. And the ""Big Star"" episode, featuring a shy Elvis like singer, and then Shelley Fabares singing the song number ""Big Star"" at the end of this episode. The ""Baby Buggy"" episode, with the gruff elderly woman doctor who has a heart of gold and drives a very small dilapidated old car around town, and who just loves delivering babies, played by the very talented actress Fay Bainter. ""The Makeover Man"" episode about Mary's very ill mannered boyfriend. The ""Pioneer Woman"" episode with Donna and Mary roughing it in a very beat up cabin in the great outdoors. Also, the ""Where The Stones Are"" episode, which concentrates on Donna, Alex, and Jeff who are spying on Mary, and in the meantime, Donna is trying to catch an incredibly gigantic fish which looks more like a whale!!! The ""Mrs. Stone And Dr. Hyde"" episode, where Donna takes over as Alex's Nurse and Alex seems to her to be a Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of personality. Also the episode, ""Everywhere That Mary Goes"" with the guy named Clovis that is built like a house who follows Mary everywhere. And in this same episode, the younger guy named Emory who takes revenge on Mary by putting a 'For Sale Sign' in front of the Stone's house all because Mary doesn't want anything to do with him and refuses to go out with him. And many more great episodes from ""The Donna Reed Show"" are included in this 'Season 5' DVD Set. I Can't Wait!!",1354147200,12,1798,4.552469135802469
