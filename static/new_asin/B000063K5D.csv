7959354,5,B000063K5D,"In today's world of increasinly random and savage violence, many techniques being promoted by instructors as self defense answers are simply inadequate. I have no disrespect for Taekwondo practicioners, having earned a 2nd degree blackbelt in that art, but the classic ""one-step sparring"" techniques will do precious little against a motivated, and likely armed assailant. Additionally, I teach the Chinese martial arts style Baguazhang, which has a number of ""defense"" and ""control"" tactics built in to it's movement, but again, the flowery movements of many if not all Chinese martial arts systems, especially the ""dance routine"" that modern wushu has essentially become, will do little or nothing to save you in an attack or fight.

On the other hand, with Joseph Simonet's presentation of Serak style Silat (Silat-Kuntao), we have a much more brutal, straight forward, and to the point art which translates directly as street effectiveness and reliable self defense techniques. Gone are the flowery movements and complicated steps, having been stripped away to leave the raw, forceful techniques that while they may not be pretty, certainly are efficacious in application. Simonet takes you through the remaining jurus of the Serak style on these 2 tapes (there are 18 total, but many are repetitive), breaking down each to reveal the hidden fighting techniques, defensive tactics as well as offensive means of ending a fight before it begins. In these 3 hours worth of video you will learn more than in a few years of classes, and as such I highly recommend them as a great addition to the library of any martial artist.",1130457600,2,1625,5.15530303030303
7959355,5,B000063K5D,"This is not a tape for rank beginners, that's for sure; but with basic knowledge of martial arts and their applications, there is opened in this tape set a myriad of new applications, useful training drills and powerful self defense techniques.  I have studied the martial arts (specifically, Baguazhang, Kuntao, and various Kung Fu systems) for nearly 20 years, and it is clear to a more advanced practicioner what some other reviewers have perhaps overlooked - Guru Simonet knows his stuff, knows how to apply it, and most importantly - knows how to teach it effectively.  I have this and the basic tape of the same title, and I highly recommend both as great additions to the library of any experienced martial artists looking to broaden their horizons.  Remember - you get out of your training exactly what you put into it - no more, no less.",1098057600,4,846,4.741496598639456

Buyers beware, entertainment for popcorn and soda pop.
A review from Stephen DeL'Mekoung is quite insulting.
Words right taken out of the website of Paul deThouars. While true that I worked out with Paul in Wormer, Holland from 1956 to 1960, my first Silat Serak teacher is NOT Paul deThouars.  My workout partner from Java will object to the statement made by Mr. Stephen Del'Mekoung I suggest he research before placing letters on paper. I do not know this man at all, he has no business talking about Serak, even what Simonet is doing. I do agree that Simonet does not know Serak by virtue of my knowledge of the Serak curriculum.
Dhaka Mardjoeki who lives in Surabaya Java at this time, teaches the same Serak curriculum as I teach as of this date. James Soeterberg senior to Paul deThouars by seven years was a student from the late Guru John Devries also teaches the same curriculum that I teach.
Guru Kees Boering my student whom I taught from 1956 to 1960 still has that same curriculum that I taught him during those years.
So before saying anything of my knowledge, do make sure you have the written FACTS and correct information. Pak Vic, Guru Serak",1053561600,7,1217,4.58256880733945
7959357,1,B000063K5D,"Joseph Simonet claims to be an expert in the Indonesian martial art of Serak Penjak Silat enough that he can release an instructional video tape containing advanced concepts. In fact Mr. Simonet knows almost nothing about Silat in general and Serak specifically. He sudied briefly with Victor and Willem DeTouars, who themselves despite their reputations studied very little Silat. Victor studied Serak from his older brother for one year, and then proceeded to make up the rest of his art. Simonet follows in his footsteps as far as Serak goes. Mr. Simonet may be an experienced martial artist in Chinese Kenpo, which is essentially what this tape contains. I think this video is insulting to the oldest DeTouars brother and to the DeVries family, as well as to the memory of their teachers John and Ernest DeVries as well as the teachers that came before them.",1030406400,7,862,4.910958904109589
