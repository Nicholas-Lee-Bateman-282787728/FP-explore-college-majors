First of all don't let the simple title put you off:  this is a lovely drama and storyline isn't as corny as the title sounds.  This has the love triangle, some humor, great scenery.  Unlike some kdramas which can be over the top in raw emotion (think:  Stairway to Heaven) or sometimes even in storytelling (as in 49 days), I find this drama more close to 'real life'.  The main actress who plays Teev is very convincing as the plot progresses (though at the beginning, i thought she seemed dry but i think that is part of her character).  I really think this drama is a great way to introduce a friend to kdramas.  i don't even own a dvd collection because i don't believe in watching re-runs--life has too many things to offer than for one to waste time watching repeat flicks.  However, with this  story is worth owning and showing to friends.  it's cute and sweet drama.  This is one of my fav. kdramas out there.",1342224000,,1083,4.381909547738694

Ok Bin is very convincing as Tib half korean/vietnamese.  the part that i didn't like was that she used the older brother to come to korea to find the man she loves, but that is great love.  most korean dramas deal with cheating lying monetary battles, but this one deals with just love and how great love can be.  I just wish that it was a bit longer than just a two parter, but over all, it was well made, and I especially love the scenes shot in vietnam.  Beautiful City and locale.",1318291200,,643,4.186991869918699
