8718054,1,B00YB1RLTC,"Extremely violent. Chasing money while people are strapped to explosive devices awaiting potential rescue. This movie proves that we are regressing, de-evolving. Expected a psychological thriller but not with such darkness.",1436572800,,223,6.225806451612903
8718055,3,B00YB1RLTC,"Two bank robbers are foiled in the opening scene. Years later, after they are out of prison, they opt for one last heist to put them on easy street. They knock over a cash lender place and obtain seven brief cases filled with cash. While in a 'safe house"" the cases are stolen and wired to individuals. They must go around and retrieve the cases before it blows up.

The reason why they were going to leave the country was because they had no attachments in England, which apparently wasn't the case. This is one of those films we have seen played out so many times in so many different ways, they have become rather boring unless they bring something new and exciting to the table. This one does not. The film has three main characters. Everyone else is a cameo extra. Decent acting, sound track, and quality. Just wasn't overly entertaining for me.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. 2 1/2 STARS",1435536000,,896,4.49079754601227

8718057,5,B00YB1RLTC,"We all remember Steven Berkoff's performances in OCTOPUSSY and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE - it's great to see he can still bring the fire as a maniacal villain in this indie.  The action is solid regardless, but it's worth watching simply for that performance.",1433980800,2,252,4.8604651162790695
8718058,5,B00YB1RLTC,This is probably one of the best heist movies I have ever seen for a small independent film. Highly recommend!,1433721600,,110,4.55
