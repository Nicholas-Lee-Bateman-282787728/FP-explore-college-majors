8118405,2,B000F6YWLC,"I love the 18th-century style production, but the sound-synch problem is horrendous.  The sound is generally ahead of video by approximately 180 milliseconds (almost a full syllable) ... but not even consistent.  I don't mind having a video with sound-synch problems if it is consistent.  Then I can just set the delay to 180 and watch and enjoy.  This turkey one has to continually experiment and tweak with remote.  And I can't imagine watching it without the delay box.

Problem is not my equipment, many classical concert and operas play fine.  I will publish more details as I work out the timings per scene.  As it is I can in no way recommend this DVD.",1481414400,,659,4.6695652173913045
8118406,5,B000F6YWLC,"Staging and costuming this one as if played in Mozart's own time didn't work quite as well for me as the same company's period treatment of ""The Magic Flute."" But then, if it had been staged and costumed to look like ancient Rome, how would the 18th century music have sounded? I love the work of this opera company and plan to continue watching for more.",1386201600,,355,4.393939393939394

8118408,5,B000F6YWLC,"I've always been curious about how La Clemenza di Tito would be performed by the Drottningholm Theatre. The many actors and singers with fine costumes make this performance a memorable one. Stefan Dahlberg is a very youthful and benevolant Tito and his emotions in the arias are breath taking. His mercy shown to Sesto sung by Lani Poulson is wonderful, though in the trial scene, Tito is frustrated by Sesto's silence to keep the selfish Vitellia's vicious scheme hidden and is very mean to Sesto. Lani Poulsson is a very true Sesto with some ornamentation to her own style and her gestures give off the needs for a hopeful and despairing youth. Anita Soldh potrays an alluring and a dominant Vitellia and her voice can sound commanding, yet very light and soft. Servilla, looking quite medieval in her costume and almost resembling a Pamina, is fabulous as is Annio as the unhappy and consoled lover and the faithful friend to Sesto. The tempos are generally swift as Ostman likes in his style; his musiciaqns surely are gifted to keep up with his jack rabbit pacing. This La Clemenza di Tito is a fine production and special to see!",1169942400,18,1135,4.737373737373737
