8242712,4,B0011UQ77I,"I love the movies, the scenery, the wall paper, the fabulous 60's creep factor in some. The caskets they use are awesome! They are full of grave robbers, mad doctors,  intense scenery, and old school fright! I recommend for any who like Vincent Price, Barbara Steel, and Bela Lugosi. Love it!!",1260921600,3,293,4.745098039215686
