5457754,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"This disk will probably not work on an American Blu-Ray player!  I haven't tested it myself, but it's definitely a UK disk.  Sending it back to Amazon and ordering the individual movies instead.

Fantastic films, though.",1392681600,17,220,5.055555555555555
5457755,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"Both of these movies are great, my kids and I watch them around Halloween all the time!",1424822400,,87,4.176470588235294
5457756,5,B00AMYOIZ2,Great movies and great price. I wanted to add these bluray to my 3D collection. The 3D is much better in ParaNorman than Coraline though.,1422316800,,137,4.52
5457757,5,B00AMYOIZ2,Loved it in 3D but it's only in 3D. Great price!!,1420070400,,49,3.5454545454545454

5457762,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"Some heavy themes for young kids but good quality blu ray and 3D.  Good for Halloween but be aware there is either murder or the threat of murder in these, so not as light as most usual kids' fare.",1417564800,2,197,4.051282051282051

8554430,5,B00AMYOIZ2,3d on coraline was really good.. paranorman was not very good 3d..,1493856000,,66,4.583333333333333
8554431,1,B00AMYOIZ2,"Did not realize that tgis dvd would only play in certain regions of the world..had never heard of that..? Company refused to give me a refund based on that i am in ""region 2b"". Terrible customer service from the rep that contacted me.",1488153600,,234,4.465116279069767
8554432,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"The 3D is amazing. Plays great on region 1 players. What a great deal, 2 movies for the price of one new release.",1487116800,,113,3.9565217391304346
8554433,4,B00AMYOIZ2,Was exactly what I expected,1481846400,,27,4.6
8554434,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"These were the 1st movies I watched on my 120"" projection screen from my PS4 to my 1080p 3D projector with RF 3D glasses. It was awesome.",1457913600,,137,4.111111111111111
8554435,5,B00AMYOIZ2,Here we have a double feature .my review is only for the 3D ..coraline is by far the better of the two films and has made my top 10 3D movie list out of hundreds in my collection as of now..There are a handful  of out of screen effects in this movie that are 35%to 50% out toward you..The depth is good especially when coraline goes thru the tunnel..The colors of the garden scene are absolutely beautiful in 3D..Definitely buy coraline if you love and collect 3D like me..as far as the paranorman 3D movie is a decent movie but not in my top 50 3D movie list..but for the price it's definitely worth buying both in this double feature my kids liked it ..its not the worst. .but not the best either.i didn't notice hardly any ghosting in either film..so not much there to speak about..but once again coraline is great in 3D ...,1454889600,5,827,4.335483870967742
8554436,5,B00AMYOIZ2,"I have seen the film of Coraline more than a dozen times over the years, and have even gone through sections in slow-motion and frame-by-frame on my big computer monitor to enjoy the loving attention to visual details from the animators. I love this film. So understand I know this film really really well, and I am quite aware of the nuances of the artwork. My job is in the technical visual field and I have trained my eyes for over a decade to notice tiny details that most would never see. Also know that I don't generally care for 3D in film. It's rarely a big or even marginal addition to most movies now days, in my experience.

Now understand when I tell you that seeing this film in 3D in 1080p on my big screen tv blew me COMPLETELY away. I was gobsmacked by the level of new detail and sense of immersion the 3D achieved. I have never, to this day, seen any sort of 3D that can match this. (As of writing this I still haven't found the time to enjoy ParaNorman in 3D but I have high hopes!)

Seeing Coraline in 3D on a good quality TV is breathtaking. The depth is not only genuinely there (it being stop-motion animation, with real world depth), this depth combined with the action and scenery truly adds a ton more to the visuals than you can get anywhere else. Quick bluntly, I've never seen anything like it before. What's more, every person I've ever shown this to has agreed with me, including a few of my friends who are 3D-junkies. They all can attest that Coraline in 3D is a truly amazing watching experience and puts virtually all over so called 3D films to shame.

Go watch it for yourself and enjoying seeing her and her world like you've never seen it before!",1452038400,,1684,4.339682539682539
8554437,5,B00AMYOIZ2,Paranorman is an awesome kid movie (if you love Tim Burton-esque type movies and kids are too young for them right now). Ending is pretty scary though for 4 & under.,1440979200,,165,4.354838709677419
8554438,5,B00AMYOIZ2,Great movies,1426636800,,12,5.5
8554439,3,B00AMYOIZ2,"Was very miffed. Description is inaccurate; says it's in both bluray 3d and bluray, but Paranorman is the only one with both and Coraline is only in 3d but I couldn't find that out until I opened it (now I can't return it). Also the warning about it being for the b2 region either wasn't there when I purchased it or by some freak of nature I missed it, but I had checked in the description before I purchased it to be sure and it says it's for all regions. Luckily it works in my bluray player. Also one of the discs was loose when I received it.",1425859200,,547,4.074074074074074
