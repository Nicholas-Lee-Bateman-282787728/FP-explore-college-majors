8097250,5,B000CCD26A,"If you are at all interested in the Wehrmacht of 1934 to 1945, you will love this video.  It is only too bad that it is not longer at only 55 minutes.",1389052800,,150,3.6875
8097251,4,B000CCD26A,"The images of artillery crews are clear and sharp, the action fast and furious.

The music is good-- maybe Wagner. There is too much material here for one hour; it needs to be three separate programs: Ground artillery, FLAK, and Railroad Guns.

The FLAK 88 mm, developed in the Spanish Civil War, could be a program all its own. In one scene of the 88 mm firing, a B-17 drops from the sky like a rock. In its ground employment, the 88 mm was the only weapon able to deal with the T34 and KV series Soviet tanks.

RR guns: Krupp had 200 working on their RR guns at start of war, then 2000 by mid-war. The largest was the Dora, completed in 1942, weighing 1350 tons, barrel diameter 80 cm. I saw one at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland years ago.

Another program could be RR guns and the Atlantic Wall artillery. The Atlantic Wall artillery was very important, but the Allies landed where the Germans did not expect, and the guns never got the chance to fire in anger. There is good presentation of the artillery modifications for the winter war in Russia, the coldest winter in 50 years. WWI guns are mentioned briefly, in their role in the 1918 Spring Offensive against the Allies, and are tied into the development of artillery by Rheinmetal and Krupp in the late 1920s.

To begin to understand WWII, one must know WWI. That 1927 75mm light Infantry gun m/18 surely looks like the 105 mm howitzer we trained on in the Marines at Quantico, Virginia, in 1969.

This is one of the better programs in the VFA series. See also the Panzer series, and German Military Vehicles.",1369526400,,1580,4.46875
8097252,5,B000CCD26A,"Guns of the Wehrmacht 1933-1945 takes a relatively short but comprehensive look at major artillery used by the Germans in World War II. Having viewed numerous documentaries on World War II, this film stands out for utilizing much previously unseen and rare footage taken by the Nazi's during the course of the war. Some of the clips include the only known film footage of certain pieces of artillery. Obviously, most of the footage is in black-and-white and is not always the best of quality. However, that is to be expected from war footage captured from a defeated enemy.

The film covers dozens of pieces of artillery, including anti-tank guns, antiaircraft and even the famous railway guns used early on in the war. It also highlights artillery emplacements used across the Western Wall that unsuccessfully defended the coast of France during the invasion of Normandy (D-Day). One highly interesting piece of information I learned from this video included the German's use of guns captured from allied Navy vessels. These guns were deployed in custom built concrete bunkers crafted by the Germans to replace the ships these guns would normally be mounted on. The size and strength of these bunkers was enormous, their main failure only being the locations at which they were constructed.

Insofar as an overview of history is concerned, you won't get much of an overall feel for the course of World War II from watching this film. In fact, a prior knowledge of major battles during the war is really necessary to put much of the documentary into context, as history is not covered in any type of linear fashion. For those of you looking for a World War II documentary with a lot of niche, detailed information and loads of original footage, Guns of the Wehrmacht 1933-1945 would be a great choice.",1354924800,2,1801,4.901639344262295
8097253,5,B000CCD26A,"This is an excellent DVD showing the artillery used by the German army during WWII. Though it occasionally uses stills and footage while on the move, much of this footage is of combat, showing the weapons in use from the desert of North Africa to the frozen Russian landscape to Normandy.

The DVD begins with field artillery from light ""infantry guns"" (a concept developed during WWI) in 75mm and 150mm. It moves on to field artillery in 105mm and 150mm as well as heavy guns in 170mm and 210mm.

The DVD covers flak weapons from single, double and quad flak vierling mounts of 20mm guns to 37mm guns to the multiple incarnations of the flak 88 (I didn't know the ""88"" was used not only as AAA and anti-tank, but also as medium artillery!). There's even some ultra-rare color footage included.

Antitank guns are covered well showing the progression as the war went on from the 37mm Pak36 (the army's door knocker!) to the 50mm Pak38 to the 75mm Pak40 with brief mention of the very heavy 88mm anti-tank gun.

The video concludes with a fairly comprehensive look at the super-heavy guns, railway guns - including ""Anzio Annie"" - as well as coastal defense weapons converted from guns for battleships that were never built along the ""Atlantic Wall"".

My only quibble is that I would have preferred them to have shown mortars (which German units used very effectively during the war) and rocket launchers (nebelwerfers) instead of the railway, super-heavy and coastal defense guns. But, what this DVD covered it covered very well.

This is an excellent DVD for the military history buff and I recommend it with five stars.",1334448000,3,1621,4.771428571428571
8097254,4,B000CCD26A,"As the other reviewers have stated, the strength of this DVD is the wealth of film on all the major types of guns used by the Germans in World War 2. Nearly all the film is unique, not used in other war documentaries. The accompanying narration for the most part is accurate.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that I wish the documentary had included some close-up views of exactly how one loads, aims, fires, and maintains these weapons.

That said, I'm glad I purchased this DVD.",1317686400,,497,4.450549450549451
8097255,4,B000CCD26A,"The information presented in this DVD, for those with more than novice knowledge in German guns of WWII, is quite rudimentary. Hence for this group the video would be of limited value in terms of information/educational content. For those with little or no knowledge, however, the DVD would be much more informative. It covers the major infantry guns (mostly small, however), field artillery (primarily 105 and 150 mm), anti-aircraft guns (from 20 and 37 mm through 128 mm - in other words the mostly used), anti-tank guns (37mmn, 50mm, 75mm), large rail guns and fortification guns (particularly on the Atlantic All). The footage is split out among these guns in roughly the proportion that these guns were actually built by Germany, much in like the other DVDs in the ""war archives"" series.

The real strength of this video is that it presents very good film of these guns in action. There is some really impressive footage contained on this DVD. Even someone with good knowledge of the guns would be impressed. This includes all of the guns in all fronts, from North Africa through Finland. The footage includes many of roles including conventional indirect fire artillery, anti-tank, anti-air and anti-ship and direct fire. There is some particularly impressive footage of anti-ship guns at work against the allied vessels as well as anti-aircraft guns at work against allied aircraft attempting to re-supply Rejimgan. There are, however, few close-ups. Hence for model builders looking for a reference not of much use (in that case some of the Osprey or Shiffer series books are far better).",1260316800,3,1596,5.068441064638783
8097256,5,B000CCD26A,"Guns of the Wehrmacht is basically a profile of German Artillery. This DVD begins with a look at some of the early WWI guns, then quickly moves along to the pre-WWII period during the weapons build-up, glossing over tidbits such as showcasing the Krupp iron works, and discussing things like deciding on a standardized caliber size for the Panzer Corps. The way I describe it sounds convoluted and inconsistent, but it's really interesting.

The footage is once again amazing, you get to see how these big cannons are made, and some up close footage of a worker patiently grinding away to make an artillery shell a thing of perfection. Of course, the meat of the film consists of tons of great looks at these 'guns' in action on the battlefield. One instance that sticks out to me is some artillerymen destroying a tall, thin smoke stack thats probably 2-3 miles away, just dead nuts perfect shot right in the middle and the stack crumbles. Quite impressive accuracy, in my view anyway, back in a day without any computer tracking to do everything for you.

Highly informative and filled with rarely seen footage. Actually I've never seen any of this footage in any other documentary before. The people behind War: Archive Collection really have done a good job.",1194307200,5,1262,4.811059907834101
8097257,5,B000CCD26A,I found this DVD to be very informative and it had some excellent footage of the North Africa campaign which I had never seen before (many videos replay the same war clips). If you are interested in WWII specifically German weapons I would highly recommend this DVD. For the price you just can't beat it.,1188950400,4,304,4.545454545454546
8097258,4,B000CCD26A,I was very pleased by the scope and detail of this DVD.  I am glad I purchased this item.,1176163200,,89,3.6842105263157894
