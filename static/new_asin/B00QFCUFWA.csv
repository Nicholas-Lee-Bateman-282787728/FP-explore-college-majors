8691105,5,B00QFCUFWA,Absolutely speedy and wonderful service. Always double check you players regional playability and don't forget your PCs abilities. This is extremely well done. Multi language and great picture and sound.,1473638400,,203,5.8
8691106,4,B00QFCUFWA,"While it was a great series from my childhood.  I miss the narration from Stan Lee. None of the episodes have his narrative.  I haven't checked out the final episodes yet, where the spider friends became a team,  but I'm going to assume his narrative isn't there either.  That's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps if the series is ever released in the United States,  I'll buy it if Stan Lee's narrating it.",1469404800,2,412,4.298701298701299
8691107,5,B00QFCUFWA,I couldn't stand it that a lot of our beloved toons were being released in Europe and we had to just sit here in the United States and take it.  I had enough of this.  I broke down and went to Amazon to order a region free DVD player.  If you don't want to do that just go to Amazon. UK and order a region 2 code DVD player.  They are not expensive.  Once I set the player up I went to Amazon and Amazon. UK to order all the toons that were released overseas.  It all worked like charm.  I love Spiderman and His Amazing Friends.  It was a staple in my Saturday morning cartoon routine.  It took awhile for the item to get to my door but it came in decent packaging and it works fine.  I tried for years to download the bootleg copy on the net but the audio sync was always out of wack on Season 2 and 3.  This collection was remastered and it looks like they did the digital makeover.  It looks fantastic on my HDTV.  The packaging was not good since the 4 discs are on top of each other but its not a deal breaker.  If its released in America I will buy it again but this will work for me now.  They are some good toons that were officially released in Europe that were not released here.,1458691200,6,1190,3.962025316455696
