You know how they say the best parts of the film are in the trailer? This whole film is like the trailer. If you can handle the trailer then you will love this movie. Best horror film I have seen in awhile. Truly delivers a one-two punch that doesn't stop.

Awesome job guys :)",1408579200,2,427,4.195121951219512
6411701,5,B00KB01MO2,"Wow wee wow, what a story, what a hell of a horror story.  I'm thoroughly horrified and haven't ever seen anything like the movie I just finished watching.  I did, to be honest, have to look away a few times - so if you're not a fan of gore, best pass on this film.  There were a couple of scenes that made me jump out of my skin.  There were shocking visuals that were disturbing so if that isn't your cup of tea (if you're not a fan of true horror) pass on this movie.  On the other hand, if you've been waiting for the film that ""one-up'd"" the others - look no further, pay the $$ and don't wait for the rental.  It's worth it and you'll probably want to watch this one more than once anyway.",1408492800,2,695,4.0

I'm not going to go into details as I tend to give away spoilers, and yes this is found footage style but well done, and I will add its similar to Lovely Molly in the way of watching someone descend into madness.",1408060800,15,465,4.065217391304348

  But it was footage well done ( not shaky annoying footage either).. and it got better and better..
  It was about the most believable posession.. the story was well done..there was a lot of macabre weird stuff but it fit the story.. and the main character did a really good job!
  There were little things here and there that were cleverly done and i imagine watching it again i will find more as you often do when scenes have a lot goin on!
  Its not overly long either so when the pressure ramps up..it keeps up!

This is more realistic to what demon possession looks like and what can happen if you mess with the wrong things and what demons can do. It's not over done with special effects like most possession movies. As a Christian who believes in it this spooks the hell out of me.

It's a psychological, horror/occult movie that "" makes a believer"" out of atheist Michael King. The actors/actresses are all unknowns (to me that is) yet they all do a great job.  It's hard, if not impossible, to tell more without ruining the movie for whoever reads this and wants to buy it. Trust me...you DON'T want to miss this.",1465603200,6,499,4.670454545454546

I didn't finish the paper because everything that the ""Michael King"" does in the beginning of the movie made me scream at my screen. We're talking about some stuuupid mess that you'd never think someone would do voluntarily for his documentary. I jumped and got those pins and needles in my feet during one of the scenes and had to pause it. It doesn't compare to 'The Conjuring' or Evil Dead but you'll be entertained. :)",1464652800,5,539,4.684210526315789
6411749,5,B00KB01MO2,A Very good Possession movie.  What can I say?? I've seen a ton of these types of movies.  I personally don't really like the Paranormal Activity video recording type movies as they seem pretty cliche but they pulled it off very nicely.  I definitely recommend this to people who like Demonic paranormal movies.  Definitely 5 stars in my opinion.,1462579200,,346,4.813559322033898

6411752,4,B00KB01MO2,"I loved this movie! Thrilling, scary parts, a good story line. There were a few critiques I made during the movie that I often make about new horror movies, that kind of overly use noises and camera angles to make something look more scary than it is. In some ways, that's what horror movies are, but I more deeply enjoy horror movies that capture a sort of realistic perspective in the horror and use the actor's expressions, dialogue, and character personality to really create horror.
Overall, for new movies, I would recommend this to a friend. It's definitely something I would encourage others to view, although i wouldn't go telling them it's the best horror movie I've seen. Even older movies that have less technology, again, I feel capture the true horror in the character and actor's abilities.
The Possession of Michael King goes through a non-believers process of summoning a demon after his wife dies and he is left wondering why her, and why him. It's that documentary-style film that uses a camcorder-type-view as if it's like a vlog. We see Michael go from a loving father and brother, to a pretty horrifying monster that tries to kill the ones he loved. His wife re-enters throughout the movie, in spirit, to give more background on what's going on. I really enjoyed it!",1456358400,2,1288,4.780269058295964
6411753,3,B00KB01MO2,"This movie is mediocre.  While it doesn't bring anything interesting to the table, it does deliver some creepy visuals and jolting frights.  If you're in the mood for a simple creepy BOO movie then it might be a reasonable watch, but you won't remember the movie 6 months from now, and you won't ever want to watch it again.  I tend to be very lenient on horror movies as long as they are interesting, but this one is bordering on not interesting, I find myself sleepy and unimpressed post conclusion.",1455235200,,501,4.544444444444444

6411772,3,B00KB01MO2,Good concept. but not well executed. This would have made a good first draft of things the writer or director wanted in the film but as a stand alone project it misses the mark. Get rid of the shaky cam  and try just a little more story.  With just one actor doing all the work you should get a better talent. More third person view would have made a difference and a better film.  The most interesting parts were his interaction with his camera man. Perhaps you should have flushed out that relationship further.,1450915200,,513,4.4361702127659575

6411785,5,B00KB01MO2,"David Jung shows true methodical expertise in bringing this bit of demonic mayhem to the screen. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie, found footage is usually a question mark for me, but ""The Possession Of Michael King"" focuses on keeping plausible scenarios for making the use of video footage authentic to the situations. There is one moment when Michael King goes out into the streets at the command of the demonic entity that through a flag, but considering the depth of this horror story, and Jung's ability to keep focus on the main character at all times, that moment is fleeting. The cast give great performances, Michael King is the most visible and developed character and feels real, not contrived. Plus it is a bonus that he is hot and shirtless through most of his scenes.

The special effects are the expected, well explored concepts and tricks of the possession flick genre. The thing that makes it work in ""The Possession Of Michael King"" is Jung's choices in exploring the demonic subject matter through the various occult practices. The story doesn't just focus on someone possessed. We get to watch a skeptic, non-believer tease the supernatural realm through some very dark, and evil magics. We also get to see the guy become a scared believer steadily spiral into chaos and madness at the delight of the evil he conjures so all the shock gimmicks, paranormal camera tricks, and the gory-bloody effects are icing! The soundtrack, musical score is dark, chilling, and only adds to just how sinister and cruel this nightmare tale truly is.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Possession Of Michael King"". I thought that it stayed anchored in the evil of the subject matter and the horrors that the demon demanded that the film gets really scary and intense. Shane Johnson is likable, believable and entertaining on screen. The occult aspects of the story are so well developed and explored that it just amp's the horror aspects of the film. The found footage uses typical, redundant styles we have come to tolerate in horror films today, but they are so well crafted and executed that you really get pulled into the scenes. I don't often get really excited about found footage, and very few possession films seem to impress these days, (although I enjoy all-even the bad demonic possession/exorcism movies), but I can say that at the end of ""The Possession Of Michael King"" I felt revitalized, excited and kind of creeped out-which is awesome!",1444694400,,2471,4.8530805687203795
6411786,4,B00KB01MO2,"The story is about a widowed father who is skeptical of the existence of God. He decides to make a documentary to disprove the supernatural, both good and evil to help people deal with the death of their loved ones without appealing, in his opinion to fantasy. It is a mix of his documentary footage and traditional film. On his journey he visits psychics and demonologists and priests and engages in a number of rituals to try to get possessed or to conjure up something from the other side. Well done all around.",1443225600,,514,4.537634408602151
6411787,3,B00KB01MO2,"The Possession of Michael King sort of stinks.  It's one of those fake documentary type of horror movies, which is a genre I'm getting annoyed with because these type of films usually waste too much time accomplishing very little just to get to the meat of the story.

It's about a man who loses his wife, so he visits the fortune teller that his wife frequently visited to inform her of his wife's passing.  Turns out the fortune teller encouraged the wife to make decisions that cost his wife her life in a freak accident.  The husband's incredibly upset at the fortune teller.  The husband (played by Shane Johnson) doesn't believe in the afterlife or anything associated with it, so he goes around contacting people who can possess him.  He's out to prove none of this is real.  However a husband and wife who specialize in turning people into demons are able to convincingly possess poor Michael even though he at first thinks it's all bogus.  This changes his attitude gradually like a good Exorcism-type movie should as the demon inside slowly reveals itself each day.  However there's a problem...

This movie relies on jump scares similar to the Paranormal Activity films, but it's done in the cheesiest way ever.  Often when nothing at all is happening suddenly the camera will do tricky movements and static effects will take over.  This kind of trickery happens during times when the story is simply trying to tell its story and makes no sense, and it's obviously an attempt to make viewers jump.  I mean Michael's just sitting around doing nothing and suddenly tricky movements/static effects just appear for no reason?  Yeah... a poor attempt at imitating Paranormal Activity if there ever was one.

Besides that, Shane's a good actor.  He does a fine job in this movie.  The ending is honestly really good because, without spoiling anything, Michael's daughters are a part of the outcome.  I wasn't expecting the ending to be so graphic.  A great ending, but the fake documentary genre has overstayed its welcome by this point (especially in horror movies) and this movie's no different from the others in that there's a lot of boring moments just to get to the best part at the end.",1443139200,,2198,4.7824933687002655

I've been a student of Christian Demonology for almost 4 years, and can tell you that the accuracy of this film suggests the writer(s) did their homework. That's what made this truly frightening.

So please feel free to pass on by if not relevant to you. I believe in God and the spiritual side of life, myself. I do believe there are demons. Now,  because of my beliefs, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. If I did not believe in that stuff, I still would not mess with it, but I do know demkns can mess with your mind if you are not strong in spirit and that is some scary stuff not to be played with. Now, keep in mind, this movie includes all of the theatrics, but there is a spiritual realm and I like to stay on Gods side of it. I lived in addiction and alcoholism and some of my psychotic rages were frightening. In recovery, having accepted God/Christ, I have been in my right mind for 12 years and my experience is that the spiritual side of life (Good and evil) are legit real. If your experiences or beliefs are different, fine, just sharing how the theatrics of the movie is out there but subject and cause effect in the spiritual realm were not all that far fetched.

6411873,4,B00KB01MO2,"Hells Bells! This movie actually frightened me. As a horror fan this happens only once in a blue moon as in almost never. Maybe it was my Christian upbringing. I have always loved possession/exorcism films. As with all horror most of this subgenre is trite at best. The movie is labeled by many as another ""found footage"" piece. I disagree, yes the main character and his friend film much of the action but this is subtly augmented by conventional camera angels. I found it to be more of a film of the main character making a film with the two intertwined. For a low budget movie I felt this worked very well. For those worried about ""shaky cam"" there is not much in this film, thank goodness. On to the plot...
************************************************************************************
King's wife dies suddenly in some kind of accident. His wife was a woman of some faith and/or spirituality and he is an atheist. Her death, his grief and their differing beliefs is the subtext to the movie, IMO. About six months after his wife's death King decides to make a documentary proving that there is no spiritual realm, God, etc. He feels he needs to validate his non-belief. Unfortunately, this is not explored in the film. He goes about disproving the supernatural in an interesting way, deciding to venture into black magic, demon possession, necromancy, you get the idea. What blew me away is that he readily accepts drugs from the people who are practicing the above. He takes LSD on the advise of practitioners of black magic in order to help him call a demon. Demon or not this is the set up for a seriously awful experience. As viewers we are not sure if he is having a really bad drug experience, helped by his ""new friends"" or if the call of demons is real. Apparently, a really frighting LSD trip is not enough for him to stop testing the boundaries and so he meets with a Necromancer. Again he takes some weird drug that is extracted from a toad with no question from someone he doesn't know and is placed in a cemetery for one of the newly dead souls to take residence in his body. It all goes down hill from there. He descends into madness and demonic possession. This terrifying journey of losing himself to violence to death to perversion, etc. is wonderfully done. There are creepy moments a plenty and some good jump scares. Not a movie for everyone, but if you enjoy stories of possession and the occult, I think you will enjoy this film.",1428710400,,2463,4.664367816091954

It definitely isn't. There are few, if any, found footage tropes and definitely no exorcism tropes because there wasn't an exorcism. What is most unique about this movie is that the character who is possessed is fully aware of what's happening and continually resists the demon. He has no assistance besides his own resolve. I won't spoil the ending, but it was gut wrenching.

6411958,4,B00KB01MO2,"I really like this story because it brings a different perspective to the demonic possession element. Usually a completely innocent and unsuspecting person is possessed, but in this story the lead willingly opens the door to it  something I had never seen before. First-timer David Jung and his co-writer Tedi Sarafian kick things off with a slightly vengeful Michael who displays animosity towards psychics and their cohorts because he feels such belief in superstition lead to his wifes death. A number of circumstances lead to her passing, but seeing a psychic took its toll on her. Michaels desire to prove them wrong leads to him engaging in what an angelic person like myself would refer to as very risky behavior. He sincerely tries to have a number of demons enter his body, and low and beholdmuch to his surprisehe gets his wish. We see this occur about 25 minutes into the film but it remains subtle at first. Michael tries to find logical explanations behind his ever-growing ailments, like the screaming voices in his ears. At the 40 minute mark the horror starts to really manifest and it appears that Michael is in way over his head.

Before this the horror had consisted of mostly cheap jump scares that were largely illogical, like a quick splice of a possessed Michael well before he was ever possessed. Once the horror began to manifest halfway through the piece it never relented. The writers focused much of the horror on Michael himself and did not involve many other characters. His daughter and sister were slightly effected but most of Michaels suffering involves only himself. When he finally comes to terms with what he has done we see him try every self remedy in the book. Spells and incantations do nothing to save him and we see a very different man from the beginning of the film. Now we have a believer who is living in extreme regret for what he has done. Much to my surprise there is no exorcism in the film. I cant think of many possession films, especially one with possession in the title, that does not include the always-expected exorcism sequence at the end of the film. While Michaels personal horror consumes the film I never really found it scary. It would be scary to be in his situation, but unless you can really envelop yourself in his character you won't find many worthy scares despite plenty of horror. Because the horror depends so much on Michael and hardly involves anyone/anything else it is one-dimensional. I believe this lack of additional elements lead to the horror not being as effective as it could have been. The demons within him could have served a much bigger role, where their personalities and attributes are brought to screen, but for whatever reason they stayed hidden within Michael and served as lost potential.

David Jung also directs and I will say that he did very well for his freshman effort. This is not a devout POV found footage film and the perspective shifts from first to third often. The interesting storyline had me hooked early on and the scenes where Michael tries to become possessed are very engaging. Once the possession takes place we see Michael go through both physical and psychological changes and actor Shane Johnson handles the dramatics very well. Despite a 16 year career this seems to be his first leading role, and it is one that focuses heavily on him and hardly anyone else. With Michael also serving as his own antagonist I applaud Shane for a performance bringing his character from one extreme to the other. Jungs execution of the horror is mostly positive but it did not hit as hard as I expected it to. With the horror solely based on Michael it lacked the multi-dimensional elements that would have made for increased, or at least more effective, horror for the viewer to enjoy.

Overall, The Possession of Michael King offers a unique premise to the possession sub-genre, but is not the hard-hitting film it could have been. The story kept it a little too basic and never delivered on the scares. Jungs direction is good, so this is not a complete waste, just don't go in over-hyped.",1419811200,,4093,4.752461322081575

A believable premise. The shaky cam was a bit annoying at times but not too bad. There were some very shocking moments!

6412008,3,B00KB01MO2,"This review will cover two movies: THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN and THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING. Both are found-footage films existing in the horror sub-genre of otherworldly possession. Aside from that and their similar lack of interesting titles, the two movies offer radically different experiences.

THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING - 3 stars

There's a lot of hate out there for this film. I've given it three stars, although I'd say it actually warrants 2.5. It's not that it does anything particularly wrong; it's just that it is so formulaic and lazy that its high points get lost in the general smudge of unoriginality. The title itself is the biggest head-shaker of them all, since it pretty much gives everything away, which is my way of saying that there's not much here to give away in the first place.

Michael King is a filmmaker who makes horrible documentaries. How do I know they're horrible? Well, the movie starts with him announcing his intentions to make a documentary about his perfect family, which is about one of the stupidest topics anybody could ever come up with for a documentary. Then, when his wife meets an untimely demise, partly due to advice she took from a fortune teller, he changes the topic of his documentary. Now, he has decided to make a film that the nonexistence of a supernatural world. Any student of logic will know this is a futile task -- you can't prove a negative -- and he approaches this task by seeking out demonologists and soothsayers, and eventually attempts to raise a demon spirit. I'm not ruining anything for you if I tell you that he succeeds.

The acting in this film is great. And the special effects and various scares are not that bad. The problem is that the film gives itself away from the moment you read the title. The only thing the story has going for it is the fact that the audience doesn't know specifically how this demon will be affecting our lead. That's it. Michael has a young daughter that he barely pays attention to and who exists mostly to give the script more emotional weight. Although generally speaking this is not a bad film, it uses so many clich&eacute;d ideas and refuses to court any new or interesting territory, that it ends up being forgettable. Plus, the inclusion of a predictable stinger in the last minute or so of the film makes it feel like the whole movie has completely underestimated the intelligence of its audience. So, in the end, you have a decently done film with great actors, but a poor sense of story and pacing and, ultimately, no real plot to speak of.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taking-of-Deborah-Logan/dp/B00OPX70KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taking of Deborah Logan</a>&nbsp;- 4 stars

As with the previous film, this movie has some pretty stellar performances, the top of which is our lead, who is so fearless and powerful in her role, that I almost want to say she makes up for every shortcoming this movie has.

One of the biggest differences here is that this film actually has a bit of mystery and intrigue to it. Also framed as a documentary, the makers of this film originally meant to chronicle the ravages that occur with the onset of Alzheimer's, so its opening premise also makes a lot more sense. Deborah is suffering from this debilitating disease, and our student filmmaker is hoping to track her progress as the disease makes its way deeper into her system. Of course, it quickly becomes apparent that there is something greater than the biological that is afflicting this poor woman.

Although this flick suffers from a few logical bungles in the third act, it rises above Michael King's tale by actually having some backstory and suspense to its plotting, as well as by having a far more believable foundation to its found footage element. That foundation loses a bit of its steam in the last twenty minutes, but by then it's easy to forgive the film its various flaws, not just because it's given us a mythology to become interested in, but also because it very cheekily deals with all eye-rolling viewers by including them as a character: one of the members of the documentary crew leaves the film at a point when the situation becomes aggressively paranormal. Tons of horror audience members are bound to sympathize. ""Why would anyone stick around after witnessing stuff like that?"" they might say. Or, more succinctly, ""Oh, hell, no. I'm outta here."" This character makes tracks just as the film starts to really get into nutso territory, almost as if the movie was tacitly admitting that it had lost all justification for its found-footage-ness. But since the story still has the gas, it keeps itself relatively engaging in spite of its gathering lunacy, especially to its last, chilling shot.
-------------------------------

SUMMARY

I actually enjoyed THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING at the time -- mostly due to its performances -- but the longer I thought about it, the less impressed I felt. And by the end, it started rapidly to fade from both my admiration and memory until it became just another strung-together necklace of cheap horror tropes, threaded through an aggressively weak underlying premise. THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN featured equally impressive performances (except by the young woman in charge of the documentary, who I felt was a big detraction), but also had an intriguing plotline, an unpredictable story, and enough uniquely creepy elements to distract from the other, less original aspects of its construction.",1416614400,,5531,4.950431034482759

The thought of being possessed is pretty scary and the thought that if I did what Michael did to see if demons were real, and I got possessed I might want to kill myself to in the end.

I bet there'll be a bird crashing through the window in a few sec...yep! THERE it is!!"" etc.

This is an exorcism/demon-type horror movie that delivers a great story, real drama, and some serious scares. The acting would be very good for any film, so for a horror movie, it was nothing short of noteworthy. The story tightly weaves several aspects of demon - supernatural areas (psychics, necromancer, demonologists, etc), so you end up learning a bit while this guy's journey and story plays out, with all that implies for his wife and daughter.

While it still had some really loud moments, the differences between the quiet & loud scenes were greatly rreduced, making the movie overall much more ""even"" & a more pleasant experience.
---------------------

I loved the movie but, as other reviewers have noted, the sound seriously needs fixing. I'm fortunate enough to have semi-mute on my remote so that I could turn the sound down to 50%, because the sound went from unbelievably quiet (I had to have the sound almost 100% up just to hear the dialogue) to unbelievably loud in the blink of an eye throughout the film. It's so unfortunate to have such an important element of the film be so bad because the story itself is really good. One can only hope that later releases might be re-engineered to make the sound more even so that the film could be enjoyed by a much wider audience, as it deserves to be.",1414281600,,1009,4.668539325842697

The story is okay but honestly we've seen demon possession in many other movies.  So I guess the market is just over saturated with these horror movies.

About half an hour into the movie he's gotten in touch with a necromancer who owns a funeral home, smoked DMT from a dead frog's mouth in order to substitute his own soul for a demon's, masturbated in a mortuary, met two Satanists who dose him out with LSD and gag and bind him in the basement of their home after requesting his semen, dressing up in masks and pursuing him while chanting and carrying black candles  And his skeptical quest is juuuust getting started.

The character also has a five year old girl. What's she been doing his whole time?  Lego texting?

So constant they lose their impact; they build them into the bloody transitions.  Budding documentary filmmaker who goes out to discover the paranormal and finds out that when you stare into the abyss, the abyss jumps out and shouts 'boo'?  Oh yes.  This movie has all the tropes your more novel found footage films coined years ago, along with so many standard horror staples (watch out for birds hitting glass and spooooky children's music,) you'll be surprised the director didn't throw in skeletons, jack-o-lanterns and rubber bats.

This is not to say that The Possession of Michael King (it honestly sounded like they were saying Michael Caine all the way through th film,) is an entirely horrible film.  It's not.  It actually  has a really interesting concept; man sets out to document the afterlife.  Hell, it even had some great ideas, and a genuinely spooky moment or two.  The problem is that it's so bogged down with cliches, amateurish writing, a juvenile reliance on jump scares, thematic inconsistency, and downright stupid characters that it gets painful after the first twenty or so minutes.

documentary, demanding ""proof"" that the supernatural exists.  At first, he's very skeptical and cynical, and the people he talks to seem like fruitcakes, but eventually he finds a couple willing to ""summon"" a demon for him.
At first, it doesn't seem to have worked, but of course, as the movie goes on, we realize that he is possessed.  And he becomes a believer.  It's pretty sad to watch him desperately seek help to get rid of the demon, and everyone just slams the door in his face, from his doctor to a priest, to the very couple who summoned it.
Although the movie is, technically, one of those ""found footage"" films, it is much better than the usual standard, because the cameraman actually seems to know how to handle a camera.  There are no running/jerking scenes that make you dizzy, there are no twitching/can't-hold- a-camera-still scenes that make found footage so bad.

The pacing is bearable because the plot develops realistically (if you have ever read anything about evil spirit possession, obsession, haunting, etc. you will appreciate that).  Everything gets creepier and creepier.  Then disturbing.  Then gross and pure evil.

Michael King suffers a lot.  In fact, it is his initial suffering that prods him into unfortunate games with evil.  The toll his invitation to evil exerts on him, then his family, is horrendous.  Truly terrifying and sad.  Like real life, no one wants to help him in his worst hours of need.  So he goes it alone.

I'd say this is one of the better ghost/demon/possession type films out right now.  If you easily scare, this will give you an adrenaline high.  If you are a veteran horror fan, this will have you nodding in appreciation.  It's realism and writing make this worth watching.

But at the same time experiments dabbling in things he does not comprehend how dangerous they really are

He finds this couple demonologists who I think were actually using that as a cover, anyways at their house in the creepy basement would make the Marque Desade say WTF? they tie Michael down on the floor and do a black magic ritual summoning a very powerful demon. Meanwhile he is learning albeit the hard way that yes they are very real exist and are terrifying as the demon slowly takes possession of his body

There is also this creepy twisted thing Michael and an undertaker do with occult experimenting but I'm not gonna give a lot of details don't wanna ruin it, but a hint won't hurt human teeth are used with other things. They do a weird ritual in of all places a cemetary, the folks buried there must be saying are you freaking kidding me?

If you like possession, hand-held horror films that dig at atheists, you have hit the jackpot. This is one of the better hand held productions as the horror doesn't stem from a camera jerking around while people scream in the dark. The film shows you some pretty good rituals, the ones mom would teach me. On the down side, Shane Johnson is in every scene. We couldn't develop other characters or a subplot. He had some all alone scenes that he had difficulty carrying. And didn't we see that ending before? Gosh, what movie was that?

6412167,4,B00KB01MO2,"I was not expecting much from this movie, considering that it appeared to be a run of the mill exorcism film. Man, was I mistaken. As someone who grew up Pentecostal, these are the types of movies that bother me the most, and the premise was original and not seen before. A man struggling with his belief in the Devil allows Satan to possess him to prove his existence was not only creepy, but also entirely entertaining. The acting was well-done, and some of the effects was very nicely implemented. One of the better efforts in the found-footage genre (although there seems to be plenty of shots done in the traditional manner). Well done!",1408752000,,641,4.631578947368421

8657044,3,B00KB01MO2,"AN ATHEIST PERSPECTIVE...
As a former Christian of 40 years I can honestly say that when I decided to not believe in God anymore, the Devil no longer existed either. This is an Anti-Atheist movie IMO. I don't believe in Odin either so his enemies, Absorbing Man and Adva don't exist in my life and have no influence on my life. As an Atheist, I don't worry about being possessed by the same fairy tale demons as a fairy tale god. I'd give it 5 Stars but...that gives too much credit to this superstitious crap of a god and demonic possession.
That said, I did enjoy the cinematic amateur style of this film. It plays well into the fantasy of demonic possession. It was well made. Great directing. great story...Great Acting!!!",1530316800,,726,4.549618320610687

An atheist man finds out there is more than meets the eye when he tries to disprove anything supernatural.  If you wanna have a very disturbing time watching a movie this might just fill the bill!
