5152341,4,B008CMCL7I,I am training for my first century ride and live in a snowy winter climate so training indoors can get really boring.  This DVD helped with that.  I like the narrative between Paul and his guest.  They have good discussions about cycling in general and I have learned things that I didn't know prior.  It starts out going uphill so you should warm up prior to starting as there is no time for that on the DVD.  The scenery is beautiful as well.  I would recommend this to help break the monotony of indoor training.,1366156800,2,515,4.368421052631579
5152342,5,B008CMCL7I,"I love the Paul Gallas videos!!!! I love the new things that he has incorporated into his most recent videos such as being able to see where you are on the map at the bottom of the screen and on the grade bar etc. To me what makes a video great is the scenary and the difficulty level.

I also like that he suggests a gear to put your bike into. I have some virtual videos from Hawaii, that although I like the scenary, they don't tell you what the grade is etc. I like Paul's videos for that and because by the time you are done, you have done what I refer to as a TKO (Total Knockout Workout) Workout.

I started doing Paul's videos last winter and was able to prepare myself well for a metric ride in Palm Springs, CA. We unexpectantly hit a truck load of wind the first 15 miles and although many people took the Sag support back, I was not only able to finish but also pass some people on the way. I only only 4'8"" so that truely does say something about how these videos will prepare any rider for a long ride. I loved that my legs felt strong even though I was eating sand.

I am particularly fond of the videos Paul has done of Utah. It is sooooo pretty. This one is very pretty and challenging.",1351123200,5,1203,4.067510548523207
5152343,5,B008CMCL7I,"This ride starts from the parking lot at a 7.5% grade and for the next two hours it is the same kind of intensity, lots of hills, and the scenery is spectacular through the arches! I will probably never get to the Arches myself but this video makes me feel like I am riding through them with Paul, getting an incredible workout. His conversation with his cycling friend is also really interesting and informative, talking about training and other subjects that help you improve your fitness and mindset. Great video all around.",1350691200,,527,4.739130434782608

8526820,5,B008CMCL7I,I have used this dvd the most for my indoor workouts. I find it to be challenging but realistic. Nice information while you are watching this DVD.,1523836800,,146,4.444444444444445
8526821,5,B008CMCL7I,"Nice scenery and a great winter indoor training dvd. However, I prefer dvd of actual events with others riders. This is not that type of dvd.",1520035200,,141,4.461538461538462
8526822,5,B008CMCL7I,Gets the heart pumping. Good worout!,1461542400,,36,5.166666666666667
8526823,5,B008CMCL7I,Paul delivers another great video. I have just about everyone of his videos and enjoy them all. When it is too cold here in Pa. to go out riding I pop in one of his videos and get a great workout in. Helps me thru the winter!!!!,1453939200,,228,3.872340425531915
8526824,4,B008CMCL7I,"I use this for riding my recumbant exercise bike at home.  Great pictures of Moab.  I'm not able to adjust the settings on my bike to match exactly the ride in the video, but pretty close.",1431907200,,188,4.194444444444445
8526825,2,B008CMCL7I,"I had to turn the ""coaching"" off after 20 minutes as it was just 2 guys yakking... No value.  The video is a raw (unedited) video from a ""gopro"" or similar camera... very choppy and frenetic.  This one goes at the bottom of my pile to only be used when I get bored from watching the other 10 or so riding DVDs I have, and then only to serve as a reminder of just how much better they all are.  Look elsewhere - there are plenty of better rides for similar $.",1430784000,,458,3.9565217391304346
8526826,5,B008CMCL7I,This video is hard right out of the gate. I appreciate the immense effort that Paul puts into his videos. I am an avid racer so as many of you know there really is no off season. I begin using his dvds as soon as daylight savings gets here and I am forced to train indoors. I need to get the most out of my time spent on the trainer and Paul's videos help me to do just that. This paticular dvd has great scenery and a nice tempo.,1417392000,,430,3.842696629213483
8526827,5,B008CMCL7I,"Another killer workout by Cycling Videos Online. I've got several now, and they are so good. The on-screen dashboard helps you to maximize your time if you're into measuring and planning (like if you're training for something or just a numbers nerd like me)....but if you're not, you will also get good info like how fast you should be pedaling etc. Three audio tracks to choose from. Lots of technology but not hard to use or learn at all. One of the audio tracks is a narrative between Paul (owner of CVO) and a pro or semi pro rider and trainer giving great tips and other guidance to help you be the best you can be. All of these videos by this company have narrative that's encouraging but always different topics so if you get a lot of them, it's not the same regurgitated ""pedal hard"" type of stuff. You'll learn some nutrition, training methods, safety while training etc. And if you don't want to listen to any of that (or the great guests he has in some of the videos riding with him), you can turn that audio track off and crank your own tunes. You don't have to hear any narrative with this because the dashboard shows you when to crank it up, what RPM's the trainer is running, and what his heart rate is. So you can push yourself with your own music. I've never been in better riding condition after starting with these videos. Kudos!",1410825600,,1348,4.417670682730924
8526828,3,B008CMCL7I,"DVD works, but it has a lot of scratches...",1410307200,,43,3.888888888888889
8526829,3,B008CMCL7I,The scenery is good but the video and audio is a bit amateur.  I think the price was too high for the quality.  There was not a lot of training or motivation to keep going included as you would find with some other videos of this type.,1383868800,2,235,3.978723404255319
