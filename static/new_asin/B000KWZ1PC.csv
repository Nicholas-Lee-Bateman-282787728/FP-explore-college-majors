2698750,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Moral Orel is an example of satire done right. Orel is a young boy in the town of Moralton, Statesota. Being surrounded by religious institutions and individuals, he is guided by those principles and lessons, which often lead to hilarious and (upon repeated viewings) depressing results.

I have to mention that this is NOT a show for young children. Despite the innocuous-seeming claymation, Moral Orel contains a glut of mature and sexual content.

The show outlines how easily misinterpreted and ambiguous religious texts can be. This is very understandable, given the plethora of Christian sects and the difficulty they have in finding common ground. Schisms sometimes lead to extreme violence, as was the case between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait was fueled primary by the rift between two Muslim sects.

Volume 1 includes the first 15 episodes. Themes of censorship, ""moral"" outrage, charity and more are viewed through the lens of an impressionable and naive young boy and his (to put it mildly) extremely dysfunctional and wacky family.",1477785600,2,1089,5.283236994219653

2698754,1,B000KWZ1PC,I bought this as a gift for my husband  Christmas of 2015  we initially tried to watch it on our ps3 and it wouldn't play. There's 2 and neither one will play. We just upgraded to a ps4 and it won't play on it either.  Very dissatisfied.  I don't get why they won't play.

2698756,5,B000KWZ1PC,"I was a massive fan of this series when it was featured late at night on the Cartoon Channel/Adult Swim, and after purchasing it on DVD, I still love it.  So much that I wish the entire series was on DVD.

There is s much irony, humor, spite, wit, satire, and cleverness in this series.  Not once did I think that Dino Stamatopoulos was insulting religion.  His criticism was with hypocrisy and society, because Orel triumphs in the end.

Orel's parents are bitter, nasty people.  His father Clay Puppington is a miserable alcoholic, who is also the town's mayor.  His mother Bloberta Puppington loves to clean, but she longs for the love of her husband.  She is defensive of her youngest son, but regardless of how bad of a mother she is, her son's counterpart wants to stay with her.

Orel is completely innocent, very naive, good-hearted, so inevitably, he takes things to heart and does everything wrong.  His righteousness can offend even the righteous, and one of my favorite episodes was Offensiveness.  His actions have consequences, because of the absoluteness of his innocence, but I understand he means well.

You like Orel.  Despite how much he fouls.

Great series.",1441238400,,1178,4.825

2698773,5,B000KWZ1PC,I loved the series after viewing it on Cartoon Network. It was a must have as it plays humor on christianity from a young boy's understanding of it and the adults who are in his life. A bit over the top but I get a lot of laughs.,1359676800,,229,3.7916666666666665

I purchased it immediately. I must say, I am so glad I did. This is probably one of the funniest animated series I've ever watched. And very informative (in a sarcastic, dark humorous kind of way). I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh, and isn't offended easily.  It's a shame that there aren't any  seasons 2 or 3 DVDs released in the U.S.A. and probably will never be.  But I was able to find all of the seasons on iTunes. Although I'd rather have them on DVD.. I'll take them how I get them.",1358380800,,677,4.075187969924812

2698778,5,B000KWZ1PC,"I must be a rarity in the UK just by watching this! Im aware of the responses this invoked but cannot really see why as basically the stories relate to this family,a few neighbours etc NOT the entire christian following. For anyone who doesnt know the storyline it revolves about Orel,a 12 year old who trys to interpret from what adults tell him how he can lead a good ""christian"" life. Unfortunatly,he gets it wrong nearly all the time with disastrous results usually ending with him being thrashed by his closet gay,sadistic,bordering on alcoholic,dysfunctional father! As the episodes roll out you realise just whats going on and everything you thought was normal sure aint in that neck of the woods! Dont complain folks,nothing or no one in this world is beyond scrutiny and there ARE millions of people in this world who hide behind their religion...sin 6 days a week and,as they ask for forgiveness on the sabbath they think its ok. All this series is pointing out is the blatant hypocracy of people like this. As you are no doubt aware there are a multitude of more serious issues out there in the world at present you really should be bitchin about! A brave venture people,thanks for having the guts to produce it and for allowing me to see it and make my own conclusions.  Regards to all from the UK!",1355443200,,1310,4.646551724137931

2698780,5,B000KWZ1PC,"It's like the anti-Davey and Golith / Leave it to Beaver. It's a dark satirical take on it as well as the twistedness to only expect from [adult swim]. It just lampoons Christianity propaganda in every aspect. It's brilliant and the special features are amazing. A documentry of Moral Orel includes but not limited to Dino treating his Frankenstine model like a baby and probably the greatest behind the scenes moment of Moral Orel history. Dino drunk at Comic Con with commentary included and optional. It's really funny, one of them end up wearing a Moral Orel thong while the Venture Bros and Robot Chicken folk are just completely embarrioused to be there and eventually the Moral Orel team get kicked out of Comic Con for that, Dino drinking a Vokda being slightly drunk and just fighting back any negativity against the show and him. It's really funny, as entertaining as the show. Maybe a little more. lol But seriously if you like satire, and don't mind the nothings sacret religious lampoonery, then I strongly recommend as well as Dino's new show ""Frankenhole"". Garentee to offend any Christian. Trust me, my best friend is Christian, I showed in an episode and had to shut it off within 3 minutes because he looked like he was going to either, scream, cry or rage. Either way it really disturbed him. In this case, is kind of a good thing. lol",1353974400,,1354,4.69327731092437

2698782,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Who would have thought that a adult oriented remake of 'Davey and Goliath' would be so fascinating on so many levels. The series looks at a child's life in a VERY religious community. The good, the bad and the twisted. Some aspects are very funny, while others are incredibly sad.",1335225600,,280,4.62
2698783,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Moral Orel is a fantastic show that takes bold risks and statements, and oddly enough, has been one of the few shows that has actually felt honest and true, yet maintained their edgy humor. Anyone that has been exposed to Christianity (and felt there are a few flaws in the way people try to enforce it or teach it) will find this series hysterically funny. The show does not hold back - it will offend and go the grittiest of places, but that's part of the reason why people love it.

The set-up for the DVD is interesting in that it has 1.5 seasons, but that is probably due to the fact that the episodes are rather short (generally 15 minutes each, unless there is a special). There is some entertaining episode commentaries and short behind-the-scenes vignettes.

I assume that placing the rest of the episodes onto one more volume DVD would be fairly easy because there would be 1.5 seasons left over. The second DVD was rumored to come out years ago, and it still has not happened. I am really hoping that Adult Swim will finally change this, as there is a significant market for the DVD.",1329868800,2,1094,4.492462311557789

2698785,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Moral Orel might be the best cartoon of all time if one measures the medium by its intelligence as well as hilarity.  Be forewarned, this show is not for the faint of heart or stolidly conservative.  Do not watch this show unless you've seen South Park and approve of all Parker and Stone have done.

The first season of Moral Orel might be the most pure example of smart and funny cartoon comedy I've ever seen, but to pigeonhole this show as a cartoon is an injustice.  While the show is done in (fantastic) stop-motion, it transcends any medium.  Moral Orel cuts to the heart of American/Protestant prejudice and then keeps on cutting.  Nothing is above the skewering that this show provides.  Some of the material here will surprise even the most callous heart, as in the ""Charity"" episode, but its shock value is an indication of the show's fearlessness and greatness.

Watch this for many great laughs and brilliant political/religious commentary.  Approach it with an open mind, and you will be richly rewarded.",1297382400,,1018,4.804597701149425
2698786,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Moral Orel at first glance is about a boy who trys his best to follow what god and his parents say is right, often literally, but always seems to screw things up. What it really is is a brilliant satire about the culture of repression, moral hegemony and hypocracy. The writing is clever and very funny.  As the series progresses we see past the happy facade of the generic Middleton, USA and into the dark confusing guilt driven world that lies beneath. This is in my opinion the most important show to come out of Adult-Swim so far and its genius  will be appreciated for generations to come.",1294617600,,594,4.4907407407407405
2698787,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Moral Orel is an awesome show.  Yes it's sure to offend some people but I think it has some good messages and above all it shows alot of truth, even if it's not what most people would care to hear about.

I seen where they said thanks for the 40 (something) episodes.  Will these be out on video soon ? I sure hope so.  I would love to see all the episodes and not just what aired on Adult Swim.  And come on Adult Swim I thought this kind of show was right up your alley.  what happened ?  you took this off and put on Childrens Hospital ????  WTH !!!!

also, if you like Moral Orel then give Mary Shelley's Frankenhole (also on adult swim) a chance.  From the same creator.",1290729600,2,675,4.045454545454546
2698788,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Honestly this is one of the best series of any show I've ever seen, and easily the best claymation series in my mind. It's deep and thought provoking in the 2nd and 3rd seasons and some episodes are just darn depressing and sad, you'll be amazed that a claymation show can make you cry.

It is not for people that are easily offended, it is not for people who never question their world views. This series is not for children, or even most teenagers, it is a biting satire that deals with concepts that children and most teenagers simply won't understand, it is for the thinking adult, most likely *liberal* thinking adult. Some of the gems from the series include ""while god made man in his image, some people look more like god than others"", ""crack is a gateway to slang"", the notion that eating chicken eggs is wrong because it comes from the nether-regions of chickens, not drinking your own urine is a sin because wasting vitamins is a sin. Hiring Hookers from a nearby town to be ""saved"", repeatedly, one on one with a man. Not a children's show by any stretch of the imagination.

This is a less a satire of christianity as it is a satire of conservative protestant culture, and of the protestant church, not of the religion it'self, for those who can see the satire for what it is, and that is biting truth, it's a brilliant series that is ridiculously underrated, and truly deserving of a large fanbase.

Now if only Adult Swim would release Season 2 and 3 on DVD I would be so very happy.",1282003200,,1498,4.45985401459854

I love this show, Adult Swim programs aren't everyone's cup of tea, that said there's a clear theme that runs through this show; Which is the funny goings on in a bible belt town, centred on a young boy who is very religious, he takes very literally the lessons learn at church and then incorrectly applies that knowledge to his environment (with some comic and unfortunate consequences). This has religious themes Christian's won't like much, that said if you come for an uptight background and have thrown off the shackles (& love animation) buy it.",1268611200,,596,4.796116504854369
2698790,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Here is the first Steven Wright joke I heard: ""Curiosity killed the cat, but for a few days I was a suspect."" It took me an awkward while to laugh. Now I can't get Steven Wright off my DVD player. . .
The humor in ""Moral Orel"" is more fast-acting. It's great stuff. . .even after some of the sadness kicks in. I wonder if it is going to be as addictive and as memorable as Wright's comedy.
Orel is Beaver Cleaver, reincarnated in claymation. He is, of course, moral, trying to always please God, attempting not to sin. To waste, according to Orel's forever preaching minister, is sinful. So Orel learns to turn his urine into an energy drink, resorts to masturbating into a pastry bag (a device which allows him to not ""spill his seed"" and also allows him to impregnate most of the town's women), uses the crack cocaine given to him in exchange for his charitable donation to a drug dealer. . .and his odd exploits innocently continue, always plausible, always funny.

It isn't until a few shows into this collection of the first 15 episodes of ""Moral Orel"" that you start to also see the catalog of pain: the lonely alcoholic father; the lonely frigid housewife; the lonely gay high school coach; the lonely vain minister. . .Clearly, the only people enjoying themselves here are the children. And, of course, the audience.",1267056000,3,1324,4.586497890295359
2698791,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Many attempt to categorize this series in preexisting genre, but the simple fact is that Moral Orel surpasses anything already in existence.  For those who say that it is an open mockery of Christianity, I am willing to bet that they either: A. Did not watch a single episode, or B. Did not watch the whole series through.  In reality, Moral Orel serves as a humorous, evolving, and meaningful series that no one should miss the opportunity to see.

The thing you need to know about Moral Orel is that it combines humor and meaningful depth.  The most attractive thing about the series is how it evolves and seems to grow over time.  There is a distinctively different feel as the show progresses and we see a clear evolution in each character as their history is revealed.  While other adult comedy shows like South Park, Family Guy, and King of the Hill take on situational episodes, Moral Orel makes its clay based characters seem more realistic and takes on a humanistic approach.

There are those that criticize the series as an open mockery of the Christian religion.  While the show does appear to make Christianity appear silly at times, what the viewers actually fail to realize is the mockery is actually directed towards the human character.  Those who claim to be self-righteous or even above others all suffer inherent flaws and dissatisfaction with a certain aspect of life.  On the other side of the spectrum, those who say that this is an example of how Christianity is bad would be mistaken as well.  While Orel does receive some bad advice many times, some of the lessons can be very good too.  One of my favorite moments is when Rev. Putty is speaking in church to a crowd of people who are all feeling malcontent about their lives and he speaks about how ""Nothing can be good.""  That is one of the more mature moments in the show.  For both sides of the argument, I say watch the very last episode and see how everyone turns out.  That says a lot about the series.

So, with arguments aside, if you are looking for a funny comedy with great meaning too, Moral Orel is a great choice.  Episodes are about 15 minutes long each and easy to watch.  I consider it to be a very feel good series and VERY well created.",1247702400,11,2231,4.535

2698801,4,B000KWZ1PC,"I became an instant fan of this series when I accidentally saw it while watching Adult Swim.  When I discovered this show, I had already missed several of the episodes, so I had hoped for a DVD set to have the show presented in a perfect way and in the proper sequence.  In this regard, this DVD set meets those requirements.

One of the reasons that I wanted to have the show on DVD was that I was always impressed with the density of things in the frame to view.  I was always freeze-framing my VCR trying to read the small print in the scenes through the noise of the out-dated medium of video tape.  The DVD has a very nice freeze-frame image, allowing you to see the various gags like the products in the sex shop or the accoutrements in Reverend Putty's office (such as a coffee mug that says, ""I hate my boss"").

If there is any let down for me, it is that the special features of this set could have been so much more complete.  I was expecting Dino to talk about his experiences with dogma that led him to do this series.  As for the stop-frame animation, I was expecting the same treatment that I saw on the DVD for ""Team America"" about the process of the animation.  The behind the scenes of the making of Moral Orel are pretty sparse.  There are some of the models used and some very superficial talk about the process, but no real insight to what it takes to bring the episode to the screen.  Also if I may, the various special features that have the creative team on-camera makes the impression that they are , uh, er, less than uh, ... well fill in your own word, but alcohol and frat boy antics are only funny for so long.  The special features are less than special, and could have been just so much more.

One point about the navigation... I was let down about the lack of commentary during the episodes.  At least that is what I thought.  Only after watching all 15 epidsodes, did I accidentally find the commentary track.  If you hit ""Play All"" on the menu screen, the episodes just play in order.  To get the ability to hear commentary, you have to go to the episode list screen, click on the specific episode, and only then will a prompt appear for the ""commentary off or on"" choice.  I watched all of the episodes that offered it (not all do) with commentary, and amongst the banter picked up some cool tidbits about the process and hassles of the animation.  Often there were just too many (unidentifiable) people talking over each other and cutting up with inside jokes.  Oh well.

That said, I have 15 pristine episodes of Moral Orel on DVD now and for that I am happy.",1177977600,8,2595,4.3312629399585925
2698802,5,B000KWZ1PC,"- to be on this show. There are people who choose to be offended by it, but that always puzzles me, as the shows humor is targeted at a certain kind of born-again hypocrite, and I don't see why anyone would choose to identify with that.

 It's truly a treat to be in a room with the people that make ""Moral Orel"". They are brilliant, funny and exceptionally talented. The animators, as well as the writers and other cast members, are top-notch.

 I give it two thumbs up, and I've seen every episode.

2698803,4,B000KWZ1PC,"Now, I love Moral Orel. I'm a big fan, like my friend. When a DVD was announced, we were jumping for joy. However, when I found out it was uncensored, it confused me. Don't get me wrong, I like uncensored DVDs. When I told my friend about this, he said, ""Well, maybe the special features are uncensored!"" I said, ""I know that."" But the extras aren't the focus of my review. The focus is on the episodes. I HAVE SEEN EVERY SINGLE EPISODE OF THE SERIES. I don't remember any bleeps placed over strong profanity (or ANY strong profanity, for that matter). Even on the 5 episodes that aren't on the DVD. Why do they say that it's uncensored when there's nothing to censor in the first place. Now I understand that it could add extra scenes, but that's not uncensored. That's unCUT. And if that were the case, there would be no need for extra director's cut of God's Chef (which is one of my favorites, next to Omnipresence). WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? WHERE IS THEIR LOGIC? Oh, wait. Now I remember. Adult Swim. Yeah. Anyway, Moral Orel gets 5 stars. Moral Orel Volume One: The Unholy Edition gets 4 stars.",1177286400,3,1100,4.4504950495049505
2698804,5,B000KWZ1PC,"Yes, there are jokes about crack addiction and zombies, but the real gems in this show are the clever wordplay, the well thought out characterizations, and hidden details.  Moral Orel is not a show with pop-culture references, cheap cartoon violence, or stoner non-sequiters.  It is a refreshingly honest and relevent satire - not to mention some incredible character animation!",1171584000,47,378,5.389830508474576
2698805,5,B000KWZ1PC,"It's from Common Sense Media:

""Created by Dino Stamatopoulos, a writer known for his regular contributions to adult comedy shows like Late Night with Conan O'Brien and TV Funhouse, this sinfully clever stop-motion series packs a wallop of a message in a short amount of time -- and, in essence, that's part of the problem. In fact, so much controversial humor peppers the show's 15-minute run that the shock value of the humor could overshadow the program's subtle message.

So while adults are more likely to see MORAL OREL for what it is -- a biting social satire mocking religious fundamentalism and hypocrisy within the Christian church -- kids (even some older teens) probably won't be able to appreciate the true sophistication of the humor. (And in case you were wondering, young children definitely won't get the joke.)

Borrowing its distinctive animation style from classic Rankin-Bass shows like Davey and Goliath, Moral Orel follows the often-shocking misadventures of 11-year-old Orel Puppington (voiced by Carolyn Lawrence), a devoutly Christian boy who tries his best to live life by ""the book"" but often misinterprets God's teachings. Week after week, Orel's good intentions lead to disaster.

But instead of learning from his mistakes, Orel is usually led astray by his pseudo-reflective father, Clay (Scott Adsit), whose advice is rarely helpful and always misses the mark. For example, at the end of an episode chronicling Orel's brief addiction to crack cocaine, Mr. Puppington cautions Orel that crack ""is a gateway to slang,"" prompting the boy to solemnly vow: ""When I do drugs, I'm going to speak properly."" Parents should be aware that those are the types of ""lessons"" kids could inadvertently learn from watching this show.

Fans of Moral Orel will undoubtedly enjoy South Park and will probably also get a kick out of revisiting old episodes of Davey and Goliath for some pointed comparisons. Other recommendations include Strangers with Candy, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons.""

And a Common Sense Note states:

Common Sense Note

Parents need to know that while this satirical Cartoon Network comedy is animated, it's part of the Adult Swim line-up for a reason: It's rife with graphic humor and isn't appropriate for young children. (For example, when the 11-year-old Orel takes a drag from his very first crack pipe, he snaps at his talking Jesus figurine and tells him to shut up.) Troubling content aside, however, the show can serve as a way for parents and older teens to talk about the pitfalls of religious fanaticism -- although families who are deeply religious may find the program offensive.

Families can discuss the ways in which religious dogma can be misinterpreted by those with good intentions. Does a person who is considered to be religious always act morally? What statement are the creators of this series making about the state of modern-day Christianity? How does this cartoon compare with Davey and Goliath, the early 1960s animated series it gently parodies?",1171411200,45,3016,5.1138211382113825
