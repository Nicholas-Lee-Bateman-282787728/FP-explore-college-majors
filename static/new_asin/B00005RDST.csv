James Earl Jones is my top reason for watching this, aside from listening to Alfre's voice narrating my favorite story, John Henry. Great history and culture lessons for all ages, especially children eager to learn. Great animation, classic characters, good stories, etc. Gives you good vibes and it definitely inspired me to help others, be kind, stay strong, work hard to make a change.",1511827200,,440,4.95945945945946

John Henry and Paul Bunyan are fun.  The Brave Engineer is fun the first time, but gets annoying with the ""EGAD!"" over and over again.

It was a fabulous literature add on to our unit of American Tall Tales.  The students learned about visualizing what they were hearing when orally sharing tall tales from both read alouds in the classroom and the storyteller.  What a treat for the students to see one way these stories were brought to life.",1469232000,,420,4.791666666666667

1654572,4,B00005RDST,"My grandkids loved these animated old stories, especially Johnny Appleseed.",1468454400,,75,6.6
1654573,4,B00005RDST,"I feel ripped off because Pecos Bill was not included on the DVD. My kid's enjoyed it since they didn't know what they were missing but, for me as a child, it was my favorite tall tale Disney covered. Who didn't love seeing prissy Slewfoot Sue get bounced to the moon? Oh well.

James Earl Jones was a very appropriate narrator. After all he is practically an American legend himself well worthy of a over exaggerated hijacked cartoon expressing his awesomeness. But enough of that.

These tall tales express how stories passed word of mouth get carried away and become far too fantastic. For instance; Paul Bunyan didn't actually ever exist, John Henry was working on the railroad because he was an inmate for thievery, Johnny Appleseed sold his apple trees, and Casey Jones Who?. But of course, find me a movie based off a real life story that actually is true to the original events. Most the animations are very fun and enjoyable; John Henry is very touching, Johnny Appleseed and Casey Jones was good for laughs (though be sure you're kids understand that no matter what the cartoons say you can't just waltz into the forest and make friends with all the wildlife, including a bear, mountain lion, and skunk), and Paul the kids found to be awe-inspiring (though I didn't care much for it, it's just John Henry without any of the heart). Cut Paul out and replace him with Bill and I'll give this five stars.",1467849600,,1411,4.64
1654574,5,B00005RDST,This is a great way to introduce students to Tall Tales. They are entertaining and really show the element of exaggeration!,1467331200,,123,4.904761904761905

1654582,5,B00005RDST,"Love this video!  I've had this Disney version since I was a kid and remember writing reports about Johnny Appleseed and Paul Bunyan when I was a kid in elementary school.  I still had it on VHS, but it was an old copy and I wanted to share it with my son, so I ordered it on DVD so I could have it for years to come.",1464480000,,317,3.716417910447761

1654594,5,B00005RDST,"The product was received in great condition!  This film brings back some very nostalgic times when my children were growing up.  I would watch these episodes on television with my children.  I especially enjoyed the Johnny Appleseed and the Casey Jones episodes.  I purchased an extra DVD to give to one of my children, so he could someday share the same memories with his children.  This is a feel good film, and a great addition to my DVD collection.  I would recommend this film to anyone.",1453852800,,492,4.662790697674419

1654597,5,B00005RDST,"Perhaps the most heroic portrayals of John Henry in animated form. The songs are soulful, catchy, and touching. Our whole family loves to watch it frequently. James Earl Jones introduces each character. Th spiritual theme of Johnny Appleseed is quite refreshing. Paul Bunyan is hilarious. I could live without Casey Jones. Too bad they didn't include Pecos Bill.",1449100800,,362,5.258620689655173
1654598,5,B00005RDST,LOVE this!  Johnny Appleseed is our favorite.  I also think the John Henry story is amazing -with the animation and the incredible songs.  These partially true stories and tall tales are part of our history and should be told to our children. I just really wish Pecos Bill was included as well.,1449014400,,294,4.615384615384615

1654606,5,B00005RDST,"This tape/disc debuted in the winter of 2002, that's why SchoolHouse Rock and 101 Dalmatians 2 made their DVD debuts in August 2002 and January 2003, instead of May and Fall 2002 respectively. ""And now our Feature Presentation""; James Earl Jones (the famous voice of Darth Vader and Mufasa) hosts all the live-action sequences of this still-being-made hour-long classic Disneytoon shorts DVD (also on VHS), and the 4 big stars of their own shorts are John Henry (2000), Johnny Appleseed (from Melody Time, 1948, alias John Chapman), Paul Bunyan (Oscar-nominated short of 1958, that lost to Bugs Bunny's only Oscar-winning short Knighty Knight Bugs), and The Brave Engineer (1950, alias Casey Jones, alias John Luther Jones), all edited prints to make it a feature-length program, in a similar manner to Mickey's Magical Christmas and Mickey's House of Villains, or Fullscreen for John Henry, to match the rest of the show. There's a couple of bonus features here on DVD; one being an old Walt Disney Presents introduction for Johnny Appleseed, in full color, and the other being a 4-in-1 montage of the American Legends themselves, with 2 games you can play. Sadly, there's other American Legends who deserved a place here, who didn't make the final cut, to make it longer, such as Pecos Bill, Ben and Me, or The Martins and The Coys. Just be thankful for what you still have, even in spite of this still being made on DVD, as of Fall 2015, without Movie Rewards codes! As the song goes, God Bless the USA... even if the discs are made in Mexico, just as Rocky and Bullwinkle was mostly made down there, even with its level of patriotism for the USA! Show your own patriotism for these American Legends and others today; after all, it was Constitution Day when I typed this review!",1442448000,,1781,4.804560260586319

My son absolutely loves it and enjoys play acting as John Henry with his ""mighty hammer"". I have a soft spot for this collection as it is something I remember fondly from my own childhood.

1654621,3,B00005RDST,"A compilation of only four animated Disney shorts featuring John Henry (2000), Johnny Appleseed (1948), Paul Bunyan (1958), and The Brave Engineer (1950).  Slapped together with narration by James Earl Jones, these unrelated stories are made to seem as though they are involved in a larger study of American myths and fables, tall tales.  But so much has been left out of this slight collection.  At only 58 minutes, one wonders why they even bothered.  They could have easily squeezed in Pecos Bill if nothing else.  As it is, the sum of the parts does not equal the whole.
I bought it primarily for Paul Bunyan (even though he was an ecological nightmare).  Love the scratchboard artwork on John Henry.",1436227200,,704,4.825

1654660,2,B00005RDST,Disappointed. This is not a collection of the Disney shorts I grew up loving. The commentary detracts from the films. The sound on Johnny Appleseed wavers indicating a poor transfer. Wanted to share the great legends of our great land.

Not one of them had ever heard of the Blue Ox, or heard the tales of Pecos Bill roping a tornado, or any of the fantastic stories we learned as kids.  Such a shame that so much gets lost in today's computer oriented world.

All the stories are uplifting and help children strive to never give up their goals!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because all of the shorts are original except for John Henrey. It's not the one from the Disney Channel when I was little. I would recommend this video to anyone with young children.

to straighten them all out before the country's sawmills could operate. And
getting the Missouri River flowing from Montana to North and South Dakota was
a backbreaker. But Paul was just getting started. The Louisiana Purchase
doubled the size of the country by a billion acres. ""The big woods,"" Paul
called them. and cleared land for farmers so fast they had their crops in
the first week.
Johnny Appleseed got ""restless feet"" hearing the west was opening up. Fear that
he might not survive kept him from going, all he knew was apple trees.
""And what's wrong with apple trees if you please?"" his guardian angel asked,
and showed Johnny how to make delicious apple pies, apple dumplings, apple
butter, all kinds of apple things he could make and sell to support himself.
""So, pack your things and get a-going,"" his angel encouraged, and Johnny
Appleseed (John Chapman) headed west to plant apple trees.

opportunities as well. ""Fire up the coal,"" he said to his fireman aboard

When I was in grade school in the early 70s we watched Johnny Appleseed and it used to make me cry at the end! This was the motivation for buying this DVD but having the other stories is really nice as they fulfil a certain theme and era when they were made. They are not over treacly in their presentation and the music is really good where it is used especially in Johnny Appleseed!

It is definitely a toss-together, but the older shorts have restored color, and I thought the (purposeful!) rustic handling of John Henry was interesting.

She was cheering John Henry all the way through. Alfree Woodward narrates. She has this amazing voice. Perfect. Next, the classic on Johnny Appleseed. I didn't realize he was an actual person! I learned something new! Oh, and the little one loved it- that and Paul Bunyon and the Brave Engineer... but then it was over... just like that. I realized that it was missing something. Outside of the piece on John Henry I grew up watching these. Something was missing... PECOS BILL. Considering this is about AMERICAN LEGENDS, Pecos Bill fit that billet to a tee. Because of this, I have to give this 4 instead of five.  I do still suggest this movie though. Enjoyable for the whole family.",1344902400,,1030,4.685082872928176
1654728,4,B00005RDST,"I remember seeing these shorts as a child on Wonderful World of Disney in the 1960's/1970's.  I was disappointed that Pecos Bill was not included.

1654729,3,B00005RDST,"Four Disney short films about legendary Americans are introduced by James Earl Jones. The first is John Henry, a freed slave who competed against a steam-driven spike driver in building a railroad and died in the effort. One clever aspect is that the story is told by Henry's widow using quilt illustrations.

The story of Johnny Appleseed is next, a film made in 1948 which I have reviewed previously in connection with an earlier collection.

Then comes Paul Bunyan, which also includes a tale of competing against automation. I guess that's what working men talk about: heroes that can beat the machine. But Paul lost by a tiny margin of error.

Finally, the story of Casey Jones, who absolutely had to get the mail train through to the west, despite all obstacles. A rather silly cartoon, but I suppose it is amusing in its way.",1336608000,,832,4.724137931034483

1654742,5,B00005RDST,"American Legends fifty-seven minutes long and was released direct to video on February 12, 2002. The video is comprised of four American folk tales as narrated by James Earl Jones. The video tell the tales of John Henry, Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan, and The Brave Engineer. John Henry, Johnny Appleseed, and The Brave Engineer are base on three real people. John Henry is based on John William Henry, Johnny Appleseed is based on John Chapman; The Johnny Appleseed segment is taken from the movie Melody Time. Finally The Brave Engineer is based on John Luther ""Casey"" Jones and comes nowhere close to the real person. John Henry and Paul Bunyan tell the story of man versus machine and the outcomes; John Henry wins but loses his life and Paul Bunyan loses and leaves with his head down low. Johnny Appleseed tells about a man who planted apple seeds in the mid-west of the United States and The Brave Engineer tells the story of an engineer who will let nothing stop him or get in his way of getting the mail on time. American Legends is great for pre-schoolers and kids in kindergarten. American Legends gets an AAA+++ for home entertainment.

Even Pecos Bill tale has been altered digitally for lack of smoking cigar. Why did they let Alice's Caterpiller alone, and bleep all the other innuendos, I just don't know. Disney, get over it! They've been putting on the brakes for releasing Song Of The South because of racist portrayals, and I adore Uncle Remus and his country critters. Please don't delete the tar baby sequence if it ever does go for dvd release. With all that comes across on the big screen now in days, Disney should loosen up its own censorship for the real deal in its cartoons. Anyone like me would rather see the genuine article, than an overlay of touchups in the studio due to some worrysome corporate figureheads at a board meeting that think certain scenes might seem unsuitable with todays crowd. God give the monumental Gone With The Wind, I love Hattie Mcdaniel to this day, and do not disown her for her honest portrayal of how black people really were in the golden age of American history.
Anyway, Disney has nothing to be ashamed of, and these constant censors are entirely unnecessary, but thanks for trying, and thanks for at least letting us view the archive cartoons, although I wish it was in original form.

1654763,4,B00005RDST,"Overall, the DVD is a nice introduction for young children to four American legends. Disney has done a reasonable job of choosing how to present each hero. (If you love a particular version of one of the legends, you might be well served by looking for the right book.)

The best story is about John Henry. The animation (very stylized) and singing are very compelling and the story has a clear narrative which is powerful. My three year old is mesmerized by it. It's worth the purchase of the DVD alone.

The story of Johnny Appleseed is a bit more problematic. If you are a Christian, you _may_ find the story rendition delightful. Others may find the religious tones of this story inappropriate or troubling for your child. Given the history of Johnny Appleseed, though, it is hard to see how you could be faithful to the story and not deal with religion.

The Paul Bunyon story is a classic story cartoon. Many of his legends are pieced together in a likeable fashion with traditional animation. It's hard not to like it, but it isn't as compelling as the John Henry work.

Finally, the Casey Jones episode is muddled and slapstick. It is the least compelling of the stories and it mainly relies on physical humor to carry forward. It's a disappointing end to the collection of stories.

I'd recommend this to parents with young children as an introduction to some American cultural icons.",1168214400,,1393,4.692622950819672

Paul Bunyan is a tall tale with the giant lumberjack as a homespun Zeus in flannel and logger boots creating the mountains and valleys of the American West with his big, blue ox, Babe...John Henry is a new take on an old folk tale. Kids of all ages will enjoy this movie which will spark further conversation and investigation.",1129680000,,585,4.91919191919192
1654766,1,B00005RDST,"I actually took advantage of Disney's refund policy and mailed it back.

As a black American, I was most disappointed in this politically corrected update version of John Henry. If Disney wanted to make an impression they should have included the original version which showed John Henry sacraficing himself by melting himself down for steel. The new version with it's rough sketchs that they didn't bother cleaning up is just lame. I almost kept it for the other classic versions which are great but in the end it just wasn't worth it.",1113177600,,536,4.826086956521739
1654767,3,B00005RDST,"This DVD was probably created as Disney's quick, kiddie answer to the surging patriotism in the United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As American consumers were buying flags in record numbers, Disney artists were likely tossing through tinny stacks of old film reels, scavenging for old pro-American cartoon clips that could be spliced into a new collection for kids. Only one of the four cartoons on this disk is new. The other three have the familiar look and sound of Disney past, and if you are American, you're guaranteed to have seen these three cartoons more times than you could have counted during your own childhood.
I'll forgive Disney for cashing in on our heightened American-ness right now. I recognize our need to feel truly united after an event like the attacks on New York and the Pentagon, and focusing on the stories that define our nation is one way to do that. Disney attempts to give children that feeling of unity with American Legends, stories of four American ""heroes"" of years past. However, the cartoon selections on the disk are poorly chosen, and the disk itself is overpriced.",1076889600,,1134,4.880829015544041

I liked how the social context of the time was explained in the little space a short allows.  The animation is fluid and life-like, but the rough pencil sketches can be seen under the color, which makes the cartoon look rough and is distracting.",1034899200,,541,4.479591836734694

I had a hard time maintaining interest so I'm sure it was difficult for my six and four year olds.  I doubt that this video will spend much time in our VCR.  I would recommend this only to those nostalgic for forty year old cartoon shorts.",1017100800,,484,4.393258426966292
1654784,1,B00005RDST,"Make money fa$t -- turn your old cartoon shorts into quick ca$h!  This overpriced, lackluster package from Der MausHaus features four animated shorts: ""John Henry,"" ""Johnny Appleseed,"" ""Paul Bunyan"" and ""The Brave Engineer.""  In between, James Earl Jones hosts dull, eye-stabbing video introductions, all of which look and sound like they were made for public-access TV.  Opening and closing credits have been snipped from each short, which will doubtless ensure the wrath of animation purists.  Still, you don't have to be an animation buff to get riled at this release.
The only new material here is ""John Henry,"" though it's hardly a worthy tribute to the legendary ""steel-drivin' man.""  The idea behind this short is solid, and the folk-influenced visuals are frequently intriguing -- which leads to the impression that, under the right circumstances, this could have been a classic short film.  But a compressed running time and obviously rushed animation virtually guarantee a third-rate product.  (In the mid-1940s, Puppetoon producer George Pal directed a stop-motion short on John Henry, which earned praise from the NAACP and still holds up to scrutiny.  Skip Disney's ""John Henry,"" and see George Pal's instead.)
The other three shorts in the program are leftovers from the Disney vault.  ""Johnny Appleseed"" comes from the 1948 package feature _Melody Time_; it practically oozes schmaltz (as well as an insistent work-for-the-common-good ethic that seems vaguely Soviet).  ""Paul Bunyan"" is a sad effort from the late 1950s with mostly limited and recycled animation.  The worst of the lot, though, is ""The Brave Engineer,"" a desperate attempt to capture some of the nuttiness of Warner Bros. cartoons.  It's dull and hectic, but not much else.
Shame on Disney for foisting this tripe on an unusupecting public.  _American Legends_ may be the worst video release in the studio's history.",1017014400,,1898,5.3076923076923075
1654785,2,B00005RDST,"The menus are slapdash and the supplemental material is unmemorable. The commentaries by James Earl Jones are informative, but useless and the shorts are NOT shown in their entirety. Disney has done us the favor of removing the opening and closing credits from each short. Admittedly, my criticism of this DVD is probably one only hard-core animation fans will be able to relate to, but I find this DVD to be unacceptable.
Maybe in some alternate universe Disney is releasing a 'Tall Tales' DVD, not in some feeble attempt to make money off of patriotism, but because they want to present their classic shorts the way they deserve to be presented. A world where Disney would even include 'Pecos Bill' and not think they'll offend people because he smokes cigarettes(like anyone cares).
If you just like to watch cartoons, rent it. If you like to buy this kind of stuff for posterity, it's not worth the DVD it's burned on.",1014076800,,922,4.76875
1654786,4,B00005RDST,"This collection of Disney animated shorts, based on American folklore, is mainly comprised of 3 previously released featurettes (Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan & Casey Jones), along with a new one (John Henry).  All of these shorts are linked by segments hosted by James Earl Jones.  The concept of featuring American folklore heroes in a full-length film is a very laudable one, given the tenor of the times since September 11, and the segments are very solid.  The ""John Henry"" section is an excellent stylized piece that tells a moving version of the legend with the Sounds of Blackness providing stirring music in the background.  The ""Paul Bunyan"" short is more in the classic tall-tale vein, while the ""Johnny Appleseed"" section is more on the sweet side.  The Casey Jones (called ""the Brave Engineer"") segment wraps things up on a more slapstick and comedic note.  Unfortunately, the DVD could've been so much more.  For what this thing costs, the almost hour-long running time is a little too short to be satisfying.  Also, there is a suprising lack of special features with only Walt Disney's original introduction to ""Johnny Appleseed"" and a couple of American folklore themed games being included.  It would've been nice to see Disney include 2 more American folklore shorts from its vault, ""Pecos Bill"" and ""Windwagon Smith"", in this collection for a more complete film.  James Earl Jones' introductions to the shorts are both informative and interesting.  While this DVD could've been so much more, given its potential, it's a solid introduction to the world of American folklore that I would definitely recommend.",1013904000,,1626,5.09811320754717
1654787,4,B00005RDST,"James Earl Jones hosts this ""program"" featuring the stories of four American Legends: John Henry, Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan, and Casey Jones. John Henry is an all new, or at least, never before seen Disney cartoon, the other three are classics you might remember from your childhood. In all it comes together as a nice little program, and the whole thing with James Earl Jones was a nice touch. I really liked seeing an actual photo of Casey Jones. The DVD was extremely lacking however, and should be selling for around 7 bucks considering the amount of stuff on it. Still, it's not without good points, but let's start with the bad, and maybe the good will make up for it. First off, there are two extras, that's it. One is a very short introduction to Johnny Appleseed by Walt Disney. The other is a pretty lame little DVD game, typical for Disney releases. The games can be enjoyable on some Disney releases, especially the pure trivia ones with video ""prizes"" at the end, but this game was annoying and pointless. The Paul Bunyan trivia half was okay, but the John Henry part got annoying. With the short feature and only these two extras, the DVD is waaaaaay over priced. Next problem, well, according to the first reviewer, the John Henry short should be in widescreen. Also, as the previous reviewer said, the picture quality of James Earl Jones' segments are totally awful. Then there's the fact that they could have included several more short classics. Pecos Bill leaps to mind, among others. This would have been a nice opportunity for them to give us an unedited Pecos, rather than the one they slaughtered for the recent releases of Melody Time. And my final complaint, well, my copy had a glitch in the John Henry segment. Of all the segments to have a glitch, it would be the brand new one! I had to go through the trouble of exchanging it, only to find the replacement had the same defect. It's right after John is stopped by the Mountain that's in his path during the contest. He looks up and the pixels that make up his face scatter a bit and the sound skips a beat. Pretty annoying. Luckily, it depends upon the player it is watched on as to whether or not the glitch is picked up. A minor disappointment was also the fact that there were no special new previews. You'd think Disney would at least come through with some good advertisements. I was hoping they'd give us the Lilo and Stitch promo featuring Beauty and the Beast, or something like that! Well, enough of the bad, now on to the good. First, I rather enjoyed the James Earl Jones sequences, as badly done as they were. They made me feel rather like I was in Disney World, watching one of EPCOT's cute little educational shows. It also gave some interesting insight into the men these legends were based on. And as cheezy as the set was, I loved it, and it was really cool of James Earl Jones to do it, he was a perfect choice! As for the features, the classics are three faves of mine, who wouldn't love them. And the new John Henry one was great, though I agree with the previous reviewer that they went a bit too far with trying to show the pencil lines. It got to be too distracting and even started giving me a headache, but other than that aspect of it I LOVED the new short! The music was great, as was the character design and the interpretation of the story. A truly beautiful film and I can't wait to see it in widescreen in front of Peter Pan 2. True, I still hope that there is a more difinitive release of all these shorts in the future, not just to get the one in Widescreen, but to get the original credits to all of them. Well, not really Appleseed since it's on Melody Time, but it'd be nice to get a difinitive edition of Melody Time! I'm still not sure that Disney realizes how much its fans care about getting their goods intact! American Legends is not the first time they've cut off the credits and jammed some toons together. After Mickey's Magical Christmas, Snowed In at the House of Mouse, where they did the same thing to Mickey's Christmas Carol and various shorts, I fear this is going to be the new trend. I only hope we do see more of the Disney Treasures collections in the future. I won't hold my breath for Song of the South. Luckily I aquired the VHS. As for the American Legends DVD, while it could have been so much more, I'll take it for what it is. I can't complain about having four GREAT Disney shorts on video, even without the widescreen or original credits.",1013644800,,4486,4.432203389830509
1654788,4,B00005RDST,I remember watching three of these cartoon shorts when I was a girl. I wanted my kids to see them since now is an important time to instill pride of our country in our kids. I especially like the introduction of each short by James Earl Jones. The only fault I see in this video is in the new short about John Henry. The animation is not clean. You can see lines in the peoples faces that should not be there. Other than that it is fine and my kids love the new songs. I rate it 4 stars.,1013558400,,487,3.9292929292929295
1654789,3,B00005RDST,"So, Disney's ""American Legends"" is out on DVD. What's so special about this seemingly un-special release? Well it includes the short film ""John Henry"" that was made by Disney's Orlando Studio and has remained there, on the shelf and completed, for two years...
At first, there didn't seem to be much publicity about the inclusion of this never before seen film on the new DVD. It was just quietly announced, and even the cover art places the animated Henry below Paul Bunyan, almost hidden
among the other characters. Now, due to the film being attatched to prints of the new theatrical feature ""Return To Neverland"", an extra sticker reads 'All New John Henry Animated Short, As Seen In Theatres', pointing to the release of 'Neverland'. Could this be a ploy by Disney to generate interest in a seemingly ""brand new"" cartoon short, or just up the running time on their Peter Pan sequel? Could be both, but my money's on the running time.
The DVD, which also includes peeks at 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Winnie The Pooh', 'Atlantis', 'Schoolhouse Rock' and '101 Dalmatians II', features the menu options on the pages of a book graphic: 'American Legends'. Select 'play'and the program starts with a cheap looking, badly shot and very poorly
compressed video introduction by actor James Earl jones. Despite the entire program only running 58 minutes, the bit-rate on these intro links rarely jumps up past 5.0Mb/sec!
The eagally awaited 'John Henry' short is first up. Rather annoyingly, the shorts are presented as part of the whole program, with Jones presenting each short. Basically this means that we are still waiting for the definitive widescreen, full version of 'JH', as it's been pan-and-scanned to fit the rest
of the 1.33:1 material here, with it's credits cut and placed in a roll with the others at the disc's end.
The 'John Henry' animation itself fits very well into the mix of the other classic Disney shorts - it bares most similarities with 'Paul Bunyan' - with a soundtrack very much in the 'Hercules'/Gospel style. The story tells of the slave John Henry, who is freed and helps forge a railroad, proving himself
against a technologically advanced steam-powered construction engine. In these sequences, there is some amazing light and shadow work, and the animation overall has a very classic look, although it may try too hard to capture the 'pencil line' look of the 60s and 70s - some of the shots expose this technique a little too obviously.
As for the original controversy (and reason the film was delayed) in having a white director, Mark Henn, direct a story about predominantly black characters, well frankly I don't know what all the fuss was about! The nine-minute 'JH' is a fantastic short and the supposedly down beat ending doesn't detract at all - in fact you could argue that 'Pocahontas' is more
unresolved. True, in another reason Disney didn't know how to handle a theatrical release, Henry is shown to pass away, but the film soon re-builds itself up to reveal the legacy he left behind, both in the form of a son and, of course, the railroad.
The animators at Disney have every right to be proud of this film - it is daring, bold and triumphant in every detail and on every level. The top Disney brass shouldn't be afraid of it at all, and at least it is available in some form, although I'll be glad to see it again in it's complete version on the front of 'Return To Neverland' (probably now the main reason to see that movie)!
As for the rest of the 'American Legneds' DVD, the additional shorts included are 'Paul Bunyan' (quite similar in theme to 'JH'), 'Johnny Appleseed' (from the 'Melody Time' feature) and 'The Brave Engineer' - although there are many more tales that could have been included to bump up the running time. The
inclusion of 'Pecos Bill', 'Ben and Me', 'The Saga of Windwagon Smith' would also have been of great interest to Disney fans! What bonus features we have are limited to an 'American Legends' Learning Game, and the original Walt Disney television introduction to 'Johnny Appleseed'.
There's nothing extra, although it's always great to see original Disney footage, but I just can't believe the program was so heavily compressed, as it's technically not using even half of the DVD's storage! The 58 minute program actually only runs 54 minutes - there's a four-short film credit roll at the end that makes up the time difference!
This title will play well enough for the average consumer's kids, but overall this DVD is a chance for Disney fanatics to own the 'JH' short - possibly the only time we'll be able to, unless that long-ago planned version of 'Song of the South' ever hits stands and they included it as an extra! Don't get me started on THAT one!!",1013472000,,4733,4.773170731707317
