2665544,4,B000J10F8M,"The rest was a freebie.  Gone are the come hither, enticing glances from the last few Hills Angels performances.  Gone are most of the actual Hills Angels from the last few shows who we came to know and love.

Although the routines are dynamic and most of the comedy is fresh, it's obvious that the compromising Benny Hill Show caved into feminist political pressures in this last set.  I believe that viewership went down, therefore the ratings - which is probably the actual reason that the BBC shut down Benny Hill.  The feminist movement was indirectly responsible.

BTW: It's not fair people saying that Benny didn't age well.  Obviously, none of the older cast members like Bob Todd and Henry McGee aged well.  Don't just single out Benny.  If you think about it, if he was alive today, he'd be a lot like Hugh Hefner; they'd probably be good buddies too!",1184976000,3,861,4.6490066225165565
2665545,3,B000J10F8M,"Benny Hill was obviously feeling pressure from political correctness at this point, as the Hill's Angels segments are far less raunchy and more covered up than in the previous sets. Benny obviously tries to go for cuteness by using children in the filmed comedy segments(they aren't bad,but they're no substitute for a bald guy getting his head slapped). It gets kind of tiresome after a while.",1181692800,6,394,4.984848484848484
2665546,5,B000J10F8M,he is the king of comedy all skits you seen before and want to see again,1171324800,,72,3.5625
2665547,4,B000J10F8M,"Of all the ones before, this is the best.  It is fresh, no repeat skits, and the inventiveness is wonderful.  There are some new faces, and the Hill's little angels are great.  For Benny Hill fans, it is sad this ends the series, but wonderful it ends on a high note.  What I found so special is that none of the material was shown before on commercial television in the US, so I was seeing it for the first time.

This is an essential set for Benny Hill fans.

The bonus interviews with three Hill's angels was rather weak;  hardly worth the effort, and inferior to the other interviews in the earlier sets.  I also found it difficult to hear all the words (or make them out) during some of the songs.  Either the accents had changed a bit, or the sound tracks were poorly mixed.  But this is minor.",1170547200,7,800,4.273333333333333
2665548,5,B000J10F8M,"What more can I say but AWESOME!  I watched this as a kid but never got to see every show. If you are a fan of Benny Hill, this series is a must see. Highly recommended!",1169424000,,169,3.6944444444444446
2665549,5,B000J10F8M,"MASTER Comedian Benny Hill is simply the BEST! When I was a student in University in England, The Benny Hill Show was guaranteed to brighten up my day especially when there was thick snow and ice outside my room in the Hall of Residence. As for Hill's Angels, a play on the words - ""Hell's Angels"", what can I say? They are really SAS! Sensuous and Seductive, voluptuous, curvaceous, nubile, beautiful...words fail me. Be sure you have a strong heart before you watch them as their graceful gyrations may just give you a heart attack, if you don't have a stroke laughing till your belly aches. To this day, I have a personally autographed photo of Benny Hill with his trademark cheeky grin, on my office wall with his handwritten words, ""To Michael, Cheers!"" I am one of his biggest fans and he is sorely missed. ""People who are not broad minded always complain that Benny's jokes are in poor taste and too raunchy. However, I always believe that minds like parachutes work best when they are open. I know, I used to parachute myself. As Benny would pronounce in his hilarious guise as Chinaman Mr. Chow Mein, who bears a striking resemblance to the former Chinese Premier Deng Shiao Ping with his slicked back black hair, ""Stoopid irriots!!"" HA! HA! Enjoy! By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet who is a famous Travel, Food & Wine Writer/Editor in Asia.",1168992000,12,1358,4.6625

2665576,2,B000J10F8M,"Circa late 1980's - This was a period of woman in the U.K. becoming empowered, and as variety shows started to see a decline on both sides of the Atlantic, Benny Hill was viewed as 'saucy', 'sexist' and 'detestable' in certain circles. So, Benny had to change the style of humor he was presenting, let's say 'toning it down' when it came to how woman where presented on his shows moving forward. He tried adding children to the antics, and though somewhat charming and innocent, it was not what those who enjoyed earlier years of The Benny Hill Show were used to. It seemed a little bit odd and out of place. He was getting older and might have been viewed as a bit perverted at this point in his life by having scantily clad ladies running about. Even the shows content was seemingly 'off ', as though the best years were well behind. I knew this set #6 was going to be a let down, from what I remember his shows of the 70's and early 80's were, but included it to have the full episode catalogue. If this set is how you are introduced Benny Hill, you may get a feeling of ""This guy isn't so funny"", and miss out on what was truly a very witty and funny comedian and clown. That is my review of Benny Hill: Complete and Unadulterated - The Hill's Angels Years, Set #6.",1390694400,,1269,4.269709543568465
2665577,5,B000J10F8M,Benny Hill enough said as far as I am concerned. The fact that he wrote every skit and joke in all of his shows just blows me away. Also his shows were not 1/2 ones as shown in America. They even had singing sets in them.,1372982400,,221,3.8260869565217392
2665578,4,B000J10F8M,"Benny is not for everyone, but I like it because it is so refreshingly unlike other shows . Like vaudeville brought into a later era. The three stooges also had vaudeville roots with a new angle of over the top slapstick. Same thing here. His witty songs and routines where his speech can be misundertood get tiresome,but it's in general good lightweight cheerful fun",1348358400,,367,4.75
2665579,5,B000J10F8M,Benny Hill is or was a genius when it came to comedy. I can sit and watch him and the 'Hills Angels' all day. It's great to see that you can provide great comedy without the filth and crap that so many tend to make a part of their routine.,1338681600,,239,3.8

2665581,5,B000J10F8M,"As a huge Benny Hill fan I now own the whole set of this series (plus all the available UK purchases as well).  He is still the best and unsurpassed.  If you love silly, slapstick humour like the chaplin films or laurel and hardy then this is the guy to watch - updated for the 80's but still as funny as if it were 60 years before.  Hills Angels are a bonus for the male viewers, me I just love the men - especially Bob Todd and Henry Magee, two comedians in their prime.

No money spent on Benny Hill is ever wasted.  These are well worth the investment.  You won't regret it.",1250899200,,578,4.070796460176991
