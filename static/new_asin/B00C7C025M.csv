5693152,5,B00C7C025M,"A very modest but beautiful movie; a sort of unexpected
little gem.  See it and savor it if you can.  Might we all
know what Maisie knew....",1370476800,2,140,4.148148148148148
5693153,4,B00C7C025M,"""What Maisie Knew"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Susanna (played by Julianne Moore) and Beale (played by Steve Coogan) and their young daughter Maisie (played by newcomer Onata Aprile). As the movie opens we see Susanna, an aging (has-been?) rock singer, and Beale, an arts dealer, arguing frequently and loudly, and in front of Maisie. It doesn't take long before Susanna changes the locks on the front door, and Beale gets his own place. Maisie finds some relief with Margo, the sitter. Susanna and Beale go to court, where Susanna gets denied sole custody, so off goes Maisie between Susanna's place and Beale's place. Maisie is very surprised to find out that Margo has moved in with Beale. At that point we are about 35-40 min. into the movie and to tell you more would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a tough child custody drama in which the child sadly becomes the playing ball of selfish adults around her. Quite a bit of the movie deals with missed/forgotten/rescheduled pick-up dates, and eventually the seeming annoyance that Maisie really becomes to both Susanna's and Beal's post-divorce lifestyles, despite the attempts (often botched) by Beale to sound or be nice. At one point Maisie arrives at his house, and he picks her up and smothers her while saying ""there is my 6th favorite girl!"". Maisie of course immediately asks ""who are the other 5 girls?"", to which Beale sheepishly mumbles ""you wouldn't understand."" Maybe not, but surely this kind of exchange will leave marks on this young girl. In fact, besides the young girl itself, there isn't a single likeable lead character in the whole movie, and at a certain point you just want to reach out to the screen and slap these people and shake them up. In that sense, this is a difficult movie to watch, but at the same time, you must give credit to co-writers Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright and co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel for creating characters who are not likeable but unfortunately probably very realistic in many real-life divorces. Kudos to young Onata Aprile, who brings a terrific performance as Maisie. As I watched her, I couldn't help but think back to that other divorce-custody drama starring a young child, and that is of course 1979's ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", starring Justin Henry as the little boy (if memory serves me right, he was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar). What a classic that movie was, and still is.

I recently saw ""What Maisie Knew"" at the Cedar Lee, the art-house theatre in Cleveland, and the screening I was at was not very well attended (and I'm being mild). Given the tone and subject matter of the movie, I just cannot see this reaching a wide audience in theaters. Bottom line, ""What Maisie Knew"" is not a feel-good movie (for that, check out the recent movie ""The Sapphires""), but in my opinion it's still worthwhile checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.",1369872000,61,3019,4.77055449330784
5693154,5,B00C7C025M,"This sweetly romantic, R-rated sleeper surprised us. Based on Henry James' 1897 novel, our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience was NOT expecting to see such a contemporary and satisfying story.

Co-directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, we were skillfully manipulated into caring a LOT about a little bitty girl in a great big city.

Here is the cast:
  * Onata Aprile (""Law & Order"") is Maisie, an obedient, compliant, smart little girl who happens to be the battlefield between her warring parents. They don't want custody of her so much as they want to hurt each other!
  * Julianne Moore (""30 Rock"") is Susanna, a shallow, possessive, rude mother who showers her little girl with kisses, then drops her off with strangers so she can pursue her own career.
  * Steve Coogan (""Ruby Sparks"") is Beale, Maisie's promiscuous, selfish father who showers his little girl with gifts, toys, and furniture, but leaves her with a lovely au pair (whom he soon marries) then he goes on a trip.
  * Joanna Vanderham (Lots of TV) is Margo, the loving, dependable au pair who has the poor judgment to marry Maisie's father.
  * Alexander Skarsgrd (""Disconnect"") is Lincoln, the handsome, kind bartender who moves in with Maisie's mother.

I was constantly reminded of the saying: ""Actions speak louder than words."" As we watched two self-centered, superficial people shuttle our little heroine back and forth, proclaiming their devotion to her, we couldn't help but want to shuffle the deck a bit. Any fool could tell what would be best for Maisie!

5693283,5,B00C7C025M,"""What Maisie Knew"" is a very touching dramatic film from 2012. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The directors are Scott McGehee and David Siegel. The screenplay is by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright. The mother might be seen as the main actor here, Julianne Moore, and this is the best I've ever seen her, I think. She gives a slightly fiery performance, and ""slightly"" is perfect, avoiding an overacting job suggested by her role as a slightly successful rock and roll star. She's terrifically awful and you come to hate her, appropriately. The father (Steve Coogan) also puts in a sharp performance playing the lively, fun parent who is a selfish womanizer, hiding, sometimes, his flaws from his daughter. His relationship with the mother is not detailed very far because it is mostly one of distance and disdain. And mutual abuse. The real star here is the girl, an utterly charming and beautifully effective actress, Onata, Aprile. She succeeds not by her delivery of great lines, but by her expressions. It's all because Henry James understood something delicate about children in these situations: they know what's going on and don't say it. And they also don't let it affect them because they simply can't afford to, or because they become hardened in some little ways, making them withdraw or act out. That Maisie maintains a delicious sweetness without playing the victim is quite remarkable, and Aprile is brilliant. Dale Haufrect",1430784000,,1475,5.049180327868853
5693284,5,B00C7C025M,"This movie was fantastic!!!! So raw and true and untimatly so sad. Definatly a movie that pulls at your heart strings and makes you really feel for Maisie. No spoilers but watch it, you won't regret it, its a wonderful movie.",1430697600,,225,4.512195121951219
5693285,4,B00C7C025M,"I really like this movie.  It has an amazing leading performance by Onata Aprile, who proves that not all child actors are stilted and annoying.  Aprile plays Maisie with such innocence, but she's not childish to the point where it becomes grating.  Her expressions are great and never come out forced or exaggerated.  Julianne Moore is great as aging rock star and Maisie's mother Susanna.  Alexander Skarsgard is endearing as Lincoln, and Joanna Vanderham does very well as Margo, despite them both being pretty archetypal characters.  They both have great chemistry with Maisie, though.  Steve Coogan does well as Maisie's father Beale, but he's not in much of the movie and doesn't leave as much of an impression. The only things I don't like about the movie are that Margo and Lincoln are too archetypal, and that the ending is incredibly predictable.  Other than that, it's a very well-made movie and is definitely worth a watch.",1430524800,,935,4.948717948717949

Six year old Maisie's life at the hands of her parents made me so angry. These truly are people who do not deserve children. This film is fantastically well acted, and portrays the subject matter so impressively that it should be used in parenting classes to show adults the effect their behaviour can have on their children. Steve Coogan is convincingly unsympathetic as a lazy slime of a father, and Julianne Moore is completely believable as the self-obsessed, treat-the-child-as-an-accessory mother.

5693318,4,B00C7C025M,"What Maisie Knew is both a heart-wrenching and compelling film. The basic plot is a portrayal of the impact that self-absorbed parents have on a darling little girl. Onata Aprile does a great job portraying Maisie, who is too oft left to her own supervision or left waiting for one care giver or another. This is the first movie where I have observed Julianne Moore acting in an unlikable role. She does a good job as a fowl mouthed, ego-centric and vindictive mother who never should have had a child. Her constant smoking around Maisie was driving me crazy! Steve Coogan was in and out of the movie so frequently that it gives us a glimpse of his role as the absentee father. His constant chatting on his cell phone also irritated me! It was fun to see Alexander Skarsgard in a clumsy, dopey, yet likable role as Maisie's stepfather. His best line is said to Susanna ...""You don't deserve her.""

This movie is disturbing, but well worth the 98 minutes of viewing time. The conclusion is not a traditional happy-ending, but it gives us some hope.",1414368000,,1047,4.598930481283422

5693412,5,B00C7C025M,"Having witnessed custody battles between separated or divorced parents of a young child, ""What Maisie Knew"" was a most compelling story. Julianne Moore plays Suzanna, six-year-old Maisie's (Onata Aprile) mother, an overbearing, falsely-affectionate, and totally selfish woman whose career as a rock star takes precedence over everything else in her life. Her equally selfish father, Beale, played by Steve Coogan, also tries to win Maisie's affection, though in a halfhearted way, as he spends much of his time trying to advance his career in Europe. Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard) and Margot (Johanna Vanderham), who are briefly married to Suzanna and Beale respectively (but only because the latter think that being married will enhance their chances of having custody of Maisie), are left to pick up the pieces with Maisie, whose parents use them as go-betweens as Maisie is shuffled from one parent to the other.

Not only is the acting superb, but the movie does an excellent job of showing the consequences of a fractured family situation from a young child's perspective. The confusion and bafflement that Maisie suffers is well portrayed, as is her growing wariness, particularly of her mother and father.

5693418,2,B00C7C025M,"This movie gets added to the list of movies made, were the screen writers and directors missed the point of the book.  They changed the meaning of the book to suit their needs and not what the book represents.  And to top it all off, they gave the movie a happy ending.  I can see how this movie didn't make it to the big screen and went straight to DVD.  Nothing stood out in this movie to make it unique or special.  How this movie got great raves at the Toronto International Film Festival is beyond me.

I feel the movie lost a lot of the meaning when it was modernized.  Even though situations like this are still happening 100 years later, modernizing the film is what changed the feel of the movie.  In the book the parents don't care about the child at all and spend their time confusing and manipulating the child into fueling the hatred for the parents. The child cant learn love or loyalty.  In the movie, the parents care for the child and make sure the child knows this.  They are just irresponsible, self-absorbed artist types who only care about their art.  The child does understand love and loyalty.  All you are doing is sitting there for 99 minutes watching the child fall in love with her step parents, while the biological parents abandon her.  Whooped Dee Doo.  It shows us nothing about What Maisie Knew.

This movie was very meh for me because all the brutal, vindictive meanness was taken out of the movie and it was very plain and boring.  I see things like this every day.  Directors/Screen Writers what makes this movie special???  Nothing, was that the point?  Is this why you changed the things you did instead of at least keeping with the original meaning.  You wanted to show us everyday life?  What is the fun in that?  The whole point of a movie is to give us a few minutes to escape from our boring, everyday lives and lose ourselves in unrealistic fantasy.

Im very indifferent in recommending this movie.  It is not a block buster movie, no big budget and nothing out of the ordinary.  Some people will feel moved by it.  Others will be bored with it and others will feel the way I do  indifferent.",1394409600,,2135,4.435567010309279

Newcomer Onata Aprile gives a spellbinding performance as Maisie. Onata is adorable. I hope she does more movies in the future because she's got the goods to go really far. Maisie's world gets turned upside down after parents go their separate ways. Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan play her parents. Julianne Moore delivers a heart-stopping performance as Suzanna. Suzanna is an aging rock star. Suzanna is outrageously selfish, arrogant, and shamefully neglectful towards Maisie. But its both of her parents that are toxic for Maisie. It's funny how much insight a young child has at that age. They absorb everything like a sponge. Maisie knows she's being used as a pawn. Maisie gets tossed back and forth between mom and dad, it's so sad because she never feels safe with either one of them. Alexander Skarsgaard and Joanna Vanderham also deliver strong performances. Skarsgaard plays Maisie's stepdad, and Vanderham plays Maisie's nanny. Their characters give Maisie the unconditional love and patience she deserves.

The movie platform is a bit short for the resolution that occurs.  It seems to evolve suddenly, and a bit unrealistic ally.

5693507,5,B00C7C025M,"This highly emotional movie begins with little Maisie (Onata Aprile) being prophetically sung to, ""Rock a Bye Baby"" by her misleadingly caring mother Susanna (Julianne Moore) at bedtime.  Her tone changes quickly to the tune of a narcissistic woman who is self-absorbed in her touring rock and roll lifestyle with little to no time for her daughter.  Her father, Beale (Steve Coogan), is equally toxic with his outright ranting and neglect of his daughter. While they are divorcing and embroiled in a horrible custody battle, they drag their innocent and fragile daughter right through it.  The whole story of this painful experience is seen through her eyes, and what wildly expressive eyes this whimsical little girl has.

As her parents are in an all-out custody war at their homes and in the courts, Maisie cannot find any attention, love, or security that remains anywhere which she may count on, not even within her school classroom.  Her parents drag her in and out of there, drop her off at the wrong times, forget to pick her up, leave her all alone, and all for their own selfish reasons.  They shockingly use her as a pawn to get digs into the other.  A 'who do you love more' situation that does not offer much to her in the first place. Her single worded answers to her parents baiting questions about each other could fill whole paragraphs with their delivery.  Maisie also has an incredible ability to show a facially flat-affect as easily as joy and laughter while enduring all she does.

Quite succinctly, Beale marries the ""Nanny"", Margo (Joanna Vanderham), and a spitefully jealous Susanna marries a bartender, Lincoln (an amazing Alexander Skarsgard), who Maisie hasn't met and does not even know yet. These two completely lovely people wind up transcending the despicable parents and offer the unconditional love for Maisie while all three are trapped within the parents constant fighting.  The parents scream at one another brutally, violently swearing in front of Maisie while she tiptoes around them.  She makes her own food at six years old, gets dressed herself, basically is in charge of parenting her parents at times.  As much as Maisie is tossed about, the new spouses are equally being neglected and are falling more and more in love with Maisie; she is always left in their charge.  During this fever-pitch which the parents are continually whipping up without respite; Margo and Lincoln, being thoroughly enchanted with Maisie, give us a place to finally exhale.  A blossoming relationship is forming between the two out of the mutual love for this adorable child and new found respectful adoration of each other.

Direction (Scott McGehee and David Siegal) of this talented cast is tight while being at a slower more harrowing pace.  The soundtrack (Nick Urata) plays in an innocently childlike manner as seen from Maisie's take on her catastrophe.  An addition of the costumes (Stacey Battat) adds the appreciated color and liveliness to Maisie with touches of kitty-eared headbands, tutus of tulle, bright colored tights and boots of all types which lift her up and out of the dullness of her parents deathlike state.  A standout performance by the young Onata Aprile with her uncanny ability to bleed her own soul through her telltale eyes and keep you fully engaged in the movie.",1387238400,3,3317,4.956678700361011

Maude is a six year ok'd living in a lovely apartment in Manhattan. Her parents, Susanna played by Julianne Moore, is a rock star, not a very convincing one in this film, however. Maisie's father, Beale, payed by Steve Coogan, is a businessman, who has no concept of what a father should be. Maisie becomes the pawn in these people's fights. Susanna loves her daughter, but lives such a narcissistic existence, she is not a good one. Divorce us inevitable, and Maisie is split between both parents. Each parent forgets to pick her up. Little Maisie in the middle is only looking for lve with no strings attached. Odonata Aprile plays Maisie and an exquisite performance she gives.

Maisie's nanny Margo, played by Joanna Vanderham, is a young woman who truly loves Maisie. Maudie's mother remarries to a very young bartender, named Lincoln, played by Alexander Skarsgard. Lincoln becomes Maisie's caregiver when Susanna goes in the road and he and Maisie develop a tender, sweet relationship. Some of the film is unrealistic, and limits the film's true meanings.

Maisie knows what she needs and wants. An adult who loves her unconditionally, and is there for her. She finds it, but not with her parents.

5693538,5,B00C7C025M,"Those who expect this updating to be close to the Jamesian source-text are in for a disappointment.  Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel transpose the tale to contemporary New York and transform it into a gut-wrenchingly powerful tale of a child (Onata Aprile) torn between two self-interested parents (Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan), and their respective spouses (Joanna Vanderham, Alexander Skarsgard).  Aprile's performance is quite simply remarkable - although obviously in love with both parents, she seems to accept everything that happens to her.  Neither parent seems particularly interested in her, despite their frequent protestations of love; the spouses try their best to make a life for Maisie, but have to cope with the fact that neither of them are her blood-relatives.  They therefore have no claim on her.  Directors McGehee and Siegel make wonderful use of New York locations: the shiny world of the upmarket apartment where Maisie has no real place; the stylish bar where Maisie has to spend one or two nights; the seedy whorehouse; and the continual shots of iconic yellow taxis, symbolizing the transience of Maisie's life.  In the end she achieves some kind of self-determination; it might not last very long, but at least it represents some kind of an advance on her past.  In dramatic terms this has to be one of the best James adaptations I've seen; far superior to many of the fusty costume dramas produced in the past.",1384646400,2,1449,5.0886075949367084

What I didn't expect was the very moving story & too often told tale of a little girl caught between her parents as their relationship crumbles.  The poor child is used as an instrument to torment the other parent between custody hearings & scheduled visitations, grilled by the mother upon return from the father, and the same interrogations from him.  The mother is a hot mess while the father clearly only wants custody as a means of tormenting the mother further.  There are marriages for each of the parents & it's in these step-parent relationships where the dynamics begin to take shape while others begin to crumble.  Throughout all of this, Maisie, the little girl, quietly goes through her life from parent to parent, house to house, having fun, and going to school.  She's a silent watcher though of all that's happening around her...  Her father's marriage & the problems stemming from it, her mother and the secrets she shares with Maisie about her marriage, her mother's insane rages, her father's treatment of her & everyone else in his life, and more.  We see all of these things & it's astounding - some of the performances are just stunning.  Skarsgard is great as a young guy who thinks he's just going to be hanging out with a little kid sometimes during the day but who really comes through for this child & learns biology isn't what makes you a parent.  The little girl playing Maisie is simply amazing!  Her silence & facial expressions do more speaking than most of her actual lines, and say more than a child could convey with words anyway.  It's an outstanding performance for a child.  Watching she & Skarsgard together was just one joyful part of the movie.  If you can watch the two of them together & not smile, you have no heart!  The relationship between the two of them is so lovely & I found myself holding my breath for the inevitable to take place - it did, and I finally got to breathe again!  Get the tissues out for those scenes!  Keep them handy for the rest of the movie.  If you have kids, if you're a single parent, you'll ""get"" this movie.  If you were raised as the child of a single parent, you'll get it & it might hit a bit close to home.  If you're not any of those, you may enjoy the acting & drama for the story, or you just might enjoy the eye candy of ASkars!  It's a topic that's not often brought up, so it's something not often explored.  It's very compelling & so well done.  I plan to watch it again!",1383350400,2,2570,4.444444444444445

Julianne Moore can do anything well. The interlopers were really sensitively nuanced and deftly woven into the drama. You almost couldn't wait till they appeared as the scenes between the parents an the child were a not a little bleak. There is no schmoozing with the camera. It is not a dark film.

5693611,5,B00C7C025M,"I initially wanted to see this movie based on my movie star love, Alexander Skarsgrd (who will now be referred to as ASkars for the remainder of this review).  I had seen photos online for months, but never saw the movie come out in theaters, unless it was one of those movies that only come out in 1 theater for like 3 days.  I think this was the case.  Regardless, when I saw it was available on Amazon, I immediately added it to my Watchlist.

Julianne Moore plays a rock star mother, and the father, Steve Coogan, some kind of international business man.  Whatever their occupations, its completely clear that neither of these persons should have had a child.  The hatred/bitterness these actors portrayed, and trying to one up each other was quite intense at times.

I've never been married nor do I have children, but the acting was so good I wanted to scoop this child up and raise her on my own!!  Onata Aprile was fantastic, what an adorable child.  I never thought I'd say that about any kid other than my niece and nephew, but she is quite a talent.

Once the parents fully split into separate residences, Coogan's character takes the Nanny, Margo.  Eventually this turns into a convenient romance--for him, completely on his terms.  Margo, girl... You can do better.  ASkars comes into this as a random guy that Moore's character marries in a tit for tat play, almost.

Come to find out that the Nanny and the faux husband ASkars make the best parents for this little girl, and it seems that even Maisie agrees!

I highly recommend this movie, no fake CGI crap, real talent acting on screen, and if you want to be slayed by the absolute cuteness of seeing ASkars babysitting adventures with Maisie, then you will not be disappointed!  It killed me!",1381017600,,1760,4.592948717948718

Julianne Moore's character might be the most despicable I've ever seen. Luckily for Maisie, she had just enough sense to marry a kind, caring human being - as did Maisie's father - apparently for the sole purpose of having  a caretaker for the child so mommy and daddy could live their lives without the inconvenient intrusion of a child.

I won't deny the performances are good and the little girl is a delight but overall the movie was tedious and predictable with no purpose except to show just how awful people can be as parents. Something I already knew.",1380758400,4,1082,4.654450261780105

I assumed, correctly, that it would center on Maisie and dealing with her parents divorce - however I wasn't prepared for the emotional response the film in it's entirety had on me.

Maisie, Margo and Lincoln are all such beautiful, caring, vibrant characters that you can't help but fall in love with. Truly those three actor/actresses did such a fantastic job. I honestly can't put it into words.

*Edited to add: WARNING, PERHAPS A SMIDGEN OF SPOILERS IN THIS RANT*
Little Maisie's parents, I swear I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle them. The father is all about himself, all the time. It's disgusting. And the mother? Jeez. What a piece of work. I know that no parent is perfect, that we all will make mistakes and I've even made a few of my own since the birth of my first daughter almost seven years ago, but the mother in this story...I could never look my child in the eye again if I ever treated her the way Susanna treats Maisie. It's kind of obvious that the mother has some severe issues, but in my eyes, it's truly no excuse. I'm still smoldering here as I write this...she used her LOVE as a weapon. If Maisie smiled at someone other than her, she was 'choosing' them over her. If the people that she CHOSE to CARE for her daughter while she was off doing everything BUT be a mother...she'd go off on them for trying to 'make Maisie like them more.' Absolutely horrific. Luckily this is a work of art and sweet little Maisie is fictional, but deep in my heart I know out there in the big, bad world there are tons of 'Maisie's' and...well, let's just say my tissue box is getting a serious workout tonight.

Wow, okay, I really went off in a tangent there. Sorry, but I had to get it out of my head or I'd never get to sleep.

But, there you have it. This movie is so thought provoking, emotional and just...truly amazing. It makes you feel. It makes you think. You can't help it, and if it doesn't then you either aren't a parent or have no soul because if you can watch a beautiful, darling child with a world of innocence in her eyes be broken and slowly pieced back together again and again without feeling anything? You might want to check and make sure you're not a robot.

I even got the Henry James book to read, but I do not recommend that unless you like page-long sentences.  It has been about a month now since I have seen it, and it is still the primary movie on my mind-despite seeing many more.  Skarsgard plays a different role than usual ones, playing someone without a lot of self-confidence, but pure-hearted.  The actress playing the step-mother is also great in her role.

WHAT MAISIE KNEW very effectively shows a child's eye view of the adult world and various things that the six-year-old protagonist understands perhaps better than anyone else. The audience attains a keen level of empathy with Maisie, caught in a crazy quadrangle of instabilities, jealousies, and intrusions of strangers. This film is fine satire on superficial priorities and relationships as well as the phoniness of the adult world in general. It's moving without being the least bit maudlin or melodramatic. Sometimes the plot seems tangential and that we need to know just a little bit more about the five central characters; however, that patchy quality still contributes something to one of the film's biggest themes, as quoted from the soundtrack in the title of this review.

WHAT MAISIE KNEW is a subtle film that does not immediately grab you with action, suspense, or any of that sort of stuff; still, if you give it a chance to immerse you, it will. Excellent acting and character development, especially by Alexander Skarsgard as Lincoln and, of course, Onata Aprile as Maisie.

A lot of screaming, cussing, and generally adult situations; otherwise, it hardly merits an ""R"" rating--No blatant violence/gore, sex/nudity, or other such elements.",1379635200,,1271,5.220588235294118

Julianna Moore portrays her vapid, ego-centric character so convincingly that I don't know that I'll ever be able to look at her the same way.

Steeve Coogan does well with his more understated role as a co-villain.

I love Alexander Skarsgard and he took his role to new heights.  He plays a stepfather of sorts with a gentle kindness I don't know that many other actors would have embraced so readily.  This may have been his best film yet.

Joanna Vanderham did a fine job as well.

Onata Aprile as Maisie just stole the show.  It's hard to believe a seven year old girl was able to capture her role as a pawn in a bitter break up between egotistical, undeserving parents with such elegance.  Her performance was so convincing it was heartbreaking, I definitely got a little weepy watching her bounce back and forth never knowing which way was up, all the while loving her parents.  Brava!

This might be the most hauntingly tragic film I've ever seen and it made me feel ""ALL OF THE FEELINGS"".  Well worth the purchase and definitely something I'm glad to have in my collection.

Does the father's departure and ousting of Margot mean he has given up on the custody arrangement he just fought for?  It seems too much.

5693759,4,B00C7C025M,"This hard to watch film was actually adapted from a 100+ year old novel by Henry James.  Hard to watch, not because of some despicable violent act, but nuanced emotional torture of a 6 year old girl by her self-absorbed parents.  Maisie (Onata Aprile) is the reproductive outcome of a union between Susanna (Julianne Moore) Beale (Steve Coogan).  They all live together even though Susanna and Beale never married.  They do well financially.

Susanna is the lead singer in a still touring rock band.  Kind of a stretch for Moore but there aren't any scenes of her actually singing at a concert.  Beale is a British business man who is constantly on the phone to someone in the world.  Things begin to fall apart between Susanna and Beale to the point that Beale moves out.  They are given joint custody but can never seem to coordinate their schedules.  This leaves Maisie in the hands of Margo (Joanna Vanderham), an au pair who has had eyes for Beale or Maisie's teachers and eventually Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard), a bartender who Susanna marries as revenge for Beale's marriage to Margo.

Maisie, becomes a ward of sorts to Margo and Lincoln as they each become targets of Susanna and Beale's self-centered lives.  What makes this film a little different is that when Maisie's parents talk with her one on one they seem like normal loving parents.  They coddle her, they kiss her, they hug her, and they promise her things.  But once that bubble bursts, it is like Maisie is invisible.  They argue...loudly and profanely.  As if Maisie isn't even in the room.  When Susanna ""must"" get on the tour bus, she hands Maisie off to a doorman.  Another time, she arrives early at school to get rid of her.  And another day she drops her off at the restaurant where Lincoln works.  Only Lincoln isn't working that day.  Like I said hard to watch.  As time goes on, Lincoln and Margo take over.  The ending is appropriately bittersweet.

The Blu ray treatment is excellent.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  The look appears very natural from start to finish.  Modest grain give the film a nice quality.  Colors look good.  Blacks are black.  No complaints here.  Likewise the audio is very good.  Here we have a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless track.  This is a dialog centered film, so there isn't much going on in the surrounds except for some ambient street noise as well as some dish and glass chattering in an upscale bar/restaurant.  Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel add a commentary track and there are a handful of deleted scenes to complete the extras.",1377907200,2,2585,4.70917225950783
5693760,4,B00C7C025M,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's becoming increasingly rare in today's big blockbuster releases that a movie comes along and touches on the three major emotions; happiness, sadness, and anger. The former is less prevalent while the latter comes in brief spurts as you gain an understanding of these characters. Sadness, on the other hand, is the more dominant emotion in What Maisie Knew. It's very easy to fall in love with this little girl which makes it just as easy to feel bad for her when her life starts spiraling out of control. Her little world is far from pretty, but she's able to keep a somewhat optimistic mind in hopes that things turn around.

To give you some context, What Maisie Knew centers around the titular Maisie (Onata Aprile), a seven year old girl who's having the misfortune of watching her parents split up. What starts as a custody battle soon turns into a quest for normalcy for this young girl. Both parents seem to view her as their trophy signifying that they've ""won"" the relationship, but neither has any plans of altering their lifestyle to compensate for the lack of a second parent. Instead, they settle for the nearest individual, get married, and hope that it gives them some sort of upper hand in court. Even when the court decides on joint custody, life for Maisie doesn't improve as she's left confused, abandoned, and unwanted.

At its core, What Maisie Knew could really be viewed as a social commentary. It's message? Children are not blind. They see everything. They see the arguments, they hear the shouting, and they feel emotional pain. Not all abuse is physical and, in most cases, the emotional abuse is far worse than any bruise or scar. With that said, though, the writers did a good job of making a point without preaching it. It was never something that was said by a character, but rather something the viewer observed through Maisie's eyes. With a movie like this it would be very easy for the writers to come out and say, ""These parents suck!"" We know that already, but the writers made it a point to show that even though they have poor parenting skills, they still love Maisie.

In addition, the writers also did a good job of being as delicate as possible with how they presented the message. There are arguments here and there (most of them distant), but there's no physical trauma and Maisie is no doubt a strong, intelligent character. She's very observant and it could be argued that she understands what's going on before one of the adults attempts to spell it out for her. As the movie progresses she realizes that life will never be what it once was, but when an opportunity presents itself she starts reconstructing a family of her own. One that loves her just as much as she loves it. It's a beautiful thing because by the end of it you can see she finally has a chance to be normal.

In addition to Maisie, there are four other main characters. Susanna (Julianna Moore) and Beale (Steve Coogan), her parents; Margo (Joanna Vanderham), her nanny; and Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgrd), her mother's ""love interest"". Susanna's in a band which means she's always busy and Beale's a businessman who is constantly having to travel. As you can see, neither has much time for Maisie, and that's where Lincoln and Margo come in. Because Maisie's parents are incapable of taking care of her while still doing their job, most of the responsibility is placed on these two individuals. It soon becomes apparent that Susanna and Beale care just as much about Lincoln and Margo as they do Maisie. Which, as you can tell, isn't much.

My only minor complaint is that the film suffers from some small pacing issues. However, this isn't something that plagues the entire film. The beginning of the movie is laid out really well as we follow Maisie to-and-from school. In fact, it isn't until the final act where things start to feel a little rushed. If I had to give a specific time frame I would say the last twenty minutes or so is when the problem first arose. While the conclusion to the story felt fitting given what this little girl had to go through, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was kind of sudden. With that said, though, it isn't something that detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.

As if the story wasn't enough to keep me engaged, the acting across the board was phenomenal. Onata's performance as Maisie was nothing short of heart-wrenching and for her first film I have to say that there isn't much to complain about. While the movie centers around her character, the writers never asked too much of her. This allowed her to excel in the simple tasks she was given. Even though Onata stole the show for me, Moore, Coogan, Vanderham, and Skarsgrd were all equally enjoyable. Skarsgrd in particular stood out with his performance as Lincoln. When you're first introduced to his character it's difficult to think of him as a good caretaker, but he really pulls through and makes you fall in love with him.

Finally, the score, composed by Nick Urata, was just as beautiful as the film itself. It's very somber and quiet, but this makes it a perfect fit because the movie never gets too hectic. It's all very reserved and understated which makes for an extremely enjoyable experience. Each composition felt perfect for its accompanied scene and each piece felt like a unique piece of art. Just an all around fantastic film score.

Overall Score: 8.5/10 - I was sold when I first saw the trailer for What Maisie Knew and I can't say that I was disappointed with the end result. Towards the end the pacing did get a little iffy, but I can't say that it ruined the film for me. It's just an all around fantastic story that's accompanied by some phenomenal acting and a beautiful score. I highly recommend you take the time to sit down and watch this. It's easily one of the best films I've seen this year.",1377820800,,5906,4.654841802492809

5693807,3,B00C7C025M,"I love Henry James.  Alexander Skarsgard rocks.  This combination might spell bliss, though I figured the direct-to-video nature of the film didn't promise greatness here.  It's a very watchable movie (thanks, Alex!), but there are so many holes in the plot--perhaps because condensing Henry James into 90 minutes of film is like condensing Henry James into a comic book.  Why would a character as apparently sensitive and good as Lincoln ever be drawn to the narcissistic, bitchy Susannah?  From the get-go, she seems cold and dismissive towards him--the viewer has no clue how she might have lured him in with her charisma and sexuality, and he seems too smart and sensitive to have fallen for her rock-star glitz. The same could be said for the opposite pairing of Margot and Beale.  Nothing about Beale is alluring.  Very, very occasionally, he's a little bit funny.  Margot seems a bit dumb, frankly, but she's not a gold-digger, so her attraction to him also seems creaky.  For me, this was a fundamental flaw in the film.  As much as I enjoyed seeing Skarsgard goof around with Onata Aprile (who is brilliant as the wary, observant Maisie), I never believed the adult relationships that made this one possible.  I think the screenwriters missed a huge opportunity by not having MAISIE be the reason Susannah was able to lure Lincoln in.  Lincoln and Margot clearly feel sorry for the little girl, and though each of them lets her down royally at times, they seem like A+ parents compared to Susannah and Beale.

The performances of Moore, Skarsgard, and Aprile are good, at times excellent (Julianne Moore is really frightening in her self-absorption, while making it completely credible), but the screenplay is badly written, with the kinds of flaws that students in an introductory fiction writing class in college would be able to point out and suggest repairs for.  There may be too many shots of Skarsgard's shy, winning smile, but the poor guy can't help it--I read that in ""Melancholia,"" Lars von Trier made him keep his shirt on in the wedding night scene because he was ""too good looking"" otherwise. He bumbles well here, but he's too old to be as clueless as he seems--an actor ten years younger would have been more convincing as a rube roped in by sequinned leggings.  Joanna V. seems to be faking her accent throughout.  Steve Coogan has a couple of ""charming"" moments, but otherwise he sneers and jeers and just seems like a first class creep.

5693811,3,B00C7C025M,"The palpable sweetness of the actress who plays Maisie the little girl and Alexander Skarsgaard who plays the bartender boyfriend cum step father are the only reasons to watch this otherwise unmemorable film.
Julianne Moore is woefully miscast as a rock star mom whose bitterness toward her ex husband drags poor little Maisie into the middle of every argument.  Enter the pretty and sweet but potentially gold digging nanny, the self absorbed and absentee father and the gorgeous but potentially brain dead bar tender boyfriend and you have an amalgam of characters who manipulate and use each other while Maisie gets lost in all the adult chaos.
 For some reason, Skarsgaard appears to have only been given one t-shirt to wear the entire movie and was either told or elected to grotesquely slouch his way through every scene.  Julianne Moore gyrates wildly between smothering Maisie with ""mommy loves yous"" or screaming expletives into the phone (or face) of anyone who shows Maisie any kindness.  Through it all however, little Maisie shines on - she wins us over with her charm and vulnerability - yet at the core she clearly is the only one who is not an emotional trainwreck (yet).  She develops a sweet relationship with bartender Skarsgaard whom the mother employs,  then marries,  in an attempt to wrest custody from the ex husband.  The best moments are between Skarsgaard and Maisie and they are sweet and tender. I would like to see a remake of say Maisie goes to College- her mother is in rehab, her father on his sixth oh too young wife - and Skarsgaard and Maisie do the cross country trek together to drop her off at college somewhere out east - now that would be worth watching - !",1377216000,,1698,4.7517006802721085

5693831,4,B00C7C025M,"This is the best movie I have seen recently. Onata Aprile plays Maisie and gives a wonderful performance as a six year old who observes her parents arguments and eventual breakup. She, then, never knows where she is going to be, from day to day as her parents pursue their own lives.
Both parents are incredibly selfish. They both are soon remarried, she to Lincoln, he to Margo, and this is, in both cases, to have a built in babysitter and cook. Another reviewer said that all the adults were unlikeable,I disagree. Lincoln, the stepfather, and Margo, the stepmother, really loved Maisie. They were soon rejected by their spouses, yet they were anchors in Maisie's life, and I found them very likeable.
If it was supposed to be a thriller, I would say that, all through, I felt  unease that something terrible would happen to Maisie, as she was so neglected by the parents, left alone in public places, waiting for someone to take her home etc. One night, she wakes up, to find herself in a house with people she doesn't know. I hadn't read this book, but I recalled that other books by Henry James did not end happily.
However, although, a bit up in the air about the future, I think the ending was very satisfactory.
  Maisie accepts all that happens to her, she is such a good little girl. Most six year olds would be having tantrums or crying in fear of abandonment. I also recommend this movie to those who have stepchildren or work with children in situations like Maisie's.",1377043200,,1482,4.584905660377358

5693877,5,B00C7C025M,"I was prepared for disappointment because of the several glowing reviews I'd read, but instead I found the film arresting, intelligent, brave, and warm.  The despicable parents were perfectly portrayed by Mr. Coogan (Beale) and Ms. Moore (Susanna).  Even through their bleary-eyed self-absorption, there emerged flashes of humanity from each, which kept the film true to its caricature-free presentation of a dissolving family.

The reviews have gushed over Onata Aprile's performance as Maisie, and they got it right.  She is never cloying, although naturally adorable, with just the right amount of beyond-her-years observations of her parents' incessant bickering and palpable hate for each other.  The observations never spoken (with one exception) but reflected in her face: a pitch-perfect combination of dismay, six-year-old disbelief, fear, helplessness, and I'm-getting-through-this-by-myself intrepidity.  Only at the end does what she 'knew' come out in one searing question to Margot (dad's new wife) as Margot is melting down over one of Beale's searingly thoughtless disappearances and disregard for any of Margot's possible feelings: ""Will you stay together?""  Brilliant.

Meanwhile, Alexander Skarsgaard (Lincoln) and Johanna Vanderham (Margot) are believable as the wide-eyed optimist and kind, nurturing nanny, respectively, and soon disillusioned spouses of Maisie's now-remarried parents.  Lincoln quickly learns he is Susanna's boy-toy and easy replacement for nanny Margot to be stuck being Maisie's care-giver with no thought for the strains on his young bartenders life. Luckily for Maisie - and for us the audience - he rises to the occasion, and his natural kindness and empathetic character help hugely to keep Maisie from being totally abandoned as her parents continue their guerrilla warfare even after their divorce and remarriages.  Margot, too, cares about Maisie even after she's relieved of her Nanny's duties, and several times rescues Maisie from Beale's forgetfulness and serial abandonment of Maisie at school.  We come to root for Margot and Lincoln as the only decent adults in Maisie's life outside of school.  Of course, one corny plot point - which we knew from the first was inevitable - is Lincoln's and Margot's hook-up and connection.  In best Hollywood fashion, they deserve each other as finding the polar opposites of their awful spouses, but isn't it just a bit too convenient?  Well, I'm happy for them and for Maisie who, at the end of the film at least, is in their care.  Mom and dad have both absconded to try and gather the remnants of their former life - she, the fading pop diva, on a road trip, and he running back home in England to find a few 'coins' he seems to be out of in New York.

Moore is great in projecting her version of love for her daughter (full of hugs and passionate declamations) which always loses out to the demands of her career.  Coogan is amazing as a cad and as a guy who really doesn't give a crap about being a dad to Maisie but in his final departing scene evidencing some awareness of how his abandoning his daughter may not be the coolest biographical entry in his resume.

Its a really fine film, notable for its avoidance of most of the clichs that would typically smother such an affecting story and saved it from the kind of Hollywood emotional excesses that make it hard to suspend our disbelief.  The writers and directors found just the right tone.  The actors, to a man and woman, played (mostly) believable parts and brought a terrific story and script to vivid life.

Maisies mom Susanna (played by Julianne Moore) is a rocker. She wakes Maisie up one late night and brings  her to this bar where her stepdad Lincoln (played by Alexander Skarsgard) works. Susanna had a show to do and wanted Lincoln to look after Maisie for a while, but he wasn't there and the cab with mom inside drove away. Maisie fell asleep and a pretty waitress took her upstairs to bed. A little while after that, Maisie wakes up and finds what seemed to be the same waitress in the next room.

Then this big-guy walks in and when Maisie sees him , she asks for her nanny margo (played by Joanna Vanderham) when little Maisie says she wants to go home, the waitress hugs her and puts her back to bed sweet little Maisie begins to cry. When I saw that scene it gutted me like a fish, Maisie had to stay there the whole night. That was one of my favorite scenes. the ending is happier, dear little Maisie finds her grace and finds a bit of peace, and there was this beautiful song, ''Feeling Of Being'' (performed by Lucy Schwartz)  the song says so much about Maisie, all that she went through, and it sums up her story.

The performances of Julianne Moore and Skarsgaard are exceptional.

There are some movies that after you watch leave you speechless because words don't do the movie justice. The two for me that come to mind are The Passion Of The Christ and We Need To Talk About Kevin. This is in another category of movie where it leaves you speechless because there are so many things you want to say about it but find it hard to express. The little girl who plays Maisie really steals the movie from Moore and the other big names by portraying a girl with such innocence that you really want nothing but the best for her in the hell she is going through. Besides being a very great movie it will also make you feel different about being a parent and why putting your child's welfare ahead of your own is so important.

5693891,5,B00C7C025M,"At the heart of this wonderful movie is a young girl, Maisie, played with both heartbreaking vulnerability and understated grace by newcomer Onata Aprile. Even well-written scripts can flounder if a child is miscast in a lead role. Thankfully, that isn't the case here.  The rest of the cast is also wonderful, from Julianne Moore (playing Maise's mother, Susanna) to Steve Coogan as Maisie's father, Beale.

I'm wary about describing this film as one which focuses on a couple's break-up and divorce. I saw it as much more than that. The often confusing world of adults, as viewed from Maisie's perspective, left me wanting to shake her parents out of their self-centered life and somehow make them see that their daughter deserved so much more from them. To be truly heard. To be truly seen.

I'm also concerned that my description (so far) may make this seem like a downer of a film. But I didn't find it depressing, at least not a good share of the time. I was heartened to see that strangers could have the insight - and compassion- to create a safe harbor for Maisie and try their best to help her.

Ironically, by showing what Maisie sees and experiences - but without detailed commentary or analysis - her silence and facial expressions speak volumes (possibly even more powerfully than words). She is a child who is simply trying to trust, understand,  and make sense of the sudden changes in her life.. So the film's viewers see and hear what she does: her parents' arguments, her joy when visiting a pond full of turtles, her reactions when visiting a home or apartment for the first time.

The filmmakers provide strong counterparts to the stereotypes of cruel stepparents. There are also  enough plot twists and suspenseful moments to create a well- paced movie, one which underscores the importance of trying to comprehend  events from a child's perspective. Or at least making a serious attempt, in spite of one's own pain.

The final scenes took me by surprise so I won't write much about those. But I will note that Julianne Moore's performance in that concluding section is stellar. In only a few minutes, she conveys anger, confusion, grief, and more....and it is all achingly realistic.

After seeing the film, I am now reading the James novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Maisie-Knew/dp/1427015724/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Maisie Knew</a>&nbsp;for extra insight as well as for comparison and contrast between James' perspective and the filmmakers take from a more contemporary viewpoint.",1376265600,26,2567,5.163855421686747

This is a tough one to rate. If I was forced to rate only on how believable the plot is, I would have given it a 6. If I rated it only on how irresistibly compelling little Onata Aprile is in her role as a neglected child, I would have given it a solid 10 without hesitation.

The first half of the film is painfully slow, and you might find yourself wondering if it is ever going to get past the point of convincing us that Maisie's mother and father are unfit parents. The film goes too far to hammer this point home, having them commit acts of neglect and abandonment that definitely would have risked their parental rights had the courts known. It's a bit tough to sit through, especially when Maisie is so helplessly bounced around between caretakers or used as a pawn in their custody battle.

But now I think maybe that was the point: it's long and painful for her, too. The film is told almost completely (and compellingly) from her perspective, and caring about what happened to Maisie was precisely what made me stick with it. I was definitely rewarded for my patience. There have been many outstanding child actors in the past, but none have gotten so effortlessly past my defenses like this one just by being herself -- nothing precocious, no genius or savant-like talent, just a normal, innocent yet somehow knowing little girl desperate to love and be loved. She fills the role so naturally, due in no small part because she was only 7 at the time, that I almost felt obligated to suffer alongside her. And when she finally gets the loving attention she deserves, you are long past caring about anyone's parental rights. Maisie not only steals the show, she steals your heart.",1501459200,2,1719,4.55663430420712
