Reed has been around a lot longer than most of the current crop of acoustic shredders, and he's long been the man to beat. For a talented man like this, that may not happen soon. Reed performs for a small crowd playing some of my favorites: ""Ladies Night"", ""Hyperjig"", and ""Blasting Cap"". The real thrill for me is at the end when he's joined by Laurence Juber--another fingerstyle master--for a couple tunes. That's when ""great"" goes to ""incredible"".

So why four and not five stars? It's because of the sound; the guitar is a bit too trebly. I've owned Ovation guitars and they can sound as warm as anything. However, the sound mix won't stop me from enjoying this disc again many more times in the future.",1425859200,,766,4.674074074074074
