3091995,5,B0012L0TFM,"This is the most brilliant operatic production I have ever seen, and it firmly established Benjamin Britten's well-deserved reputation in my mind.  The set and costumes were perfect, the music direction was stunning, and the performers blew it out of the water, and I say these things with the addition that I am not an easy sell.  Ever since the Met introduced me to Benjamin Britten, I have been enjoying his other works, notably his war requiem.  If more composers focused on the virtue of relevance, opera would enjoy an upsurge of interest in the fine arts community.",1222560000,3,572,4.816326530612245
3091996,4,B0012L0TFM,"I saw this performance at the MET and it was my first ""Grimes"" but probably not my last. I had owned a copy of the Jon Vickers CD for many years before really taking the time to listen to it. The CD recording grabbed me with the first interlude (which is very haunting and makes a perfect ending to the opera). I liked the MET's ""advent calender"" wall set, a little claustrophobic at times but certainly a different way to go. Anthony Dean Griffey, Patricia Racette and the supporting cast are excellent.",1222041600,3,504,4.489130434782608
3091997,5,B0012L0TFM,"This is the only opera written after Puccini's TURANDOT that I consider to be an opera, let alone a masterpiece. If you enjoy GRIMES, my recommendation is to get this superb telecast plus the one with Vickers. Two very different interpretations that cannot be equalled today in any opera house. Britten wrote GRIMES for Pears so we have that link here as well as Britten's marvelous conducting. Vickers' Grimes is more tragic while Pears is pathetic but both deserve to be seen as two sides of one coin. Picture quality, sound, and supporting cast are top-rate.",1218585600,15,561,4.854166666666667
3091998,5,B0012L0TFM,"In my opinion, this film is as close to the definitive staging of Britten's masterpiece as one can hope to get. If only Peter Pears was 25 years younger! When the opera was premiered in 1945, he was 35, and Joan Cross, who played Ellen Orford, was 45. I think that this is the ideal age for Grimes and Ellen. For a casual viewer, it would be hard to make sense from the story of the opera, when the title character is obviously older than anyone else in the village (as in this film). Nevertheless, we have to be very grateful for the opportunity to see Pears in the role of Grimes. As to the question of whether he was too urbane and sophisticated for this character... Well, Jon Vickers has made Grimes more conventionally operatic and ""heroic"", but Pears knew better what it is all about (being present at the conception of the opera). I particularly liked his very fine and revealing interpretation of the Passacaglia.

The advantages of this production are particularly clear compared with some recent stagings of the opera (e.g., one at the Met in 2007, which I found terrible). It also seems to me that the attempts to transfer the action to the 20th century (e.g., Opera North) are misplaced. What about buying apprentices from a workhouse? In fact, the universal meanings of this opera become more, rather than less, clear when it is put into its proper historical and geographical context.

There are some inevitable technical slips related to a life performance (e.g., the Nieces singing ""together we are safe"" are not in fact together). For a perfect musical rendering, one should go Britten's Decca recording of 1958. The current film provides a perfect complement to this recording and an incomparable historical document.",1217462400,15,1736,4.802675585284281
3091999,5,B0012L0TFM,"How very lucky we are to have the release of the TV movie version dated 1969 of Britten's Peter Grimes. All the more so because we have the composer Benjamin Britten conducting and his partner Peter Pears who created the title role of Peter in what is certainly one of the greatest operas of the twentieth century. Pears projection of the character is superb; a troubled, confused yet resolute individual trying to fit in the village. The excellent Heather Harper as Ellen tries to reach Peter but can't. Ann Robson is commendable as the opium-dazed Mrs. Sedley  the village gossip who with the drunk, failed Methodist minister Bob Boles turns the village against Grimes. All the singer/actors are very well cast. Because of the constraints of time and space, the opera had to be filmed in very small quarters on an adaptable, rotational ramp set cleverly conceived by David Myerscough-Jones. So well done that it belies the crampted space and one doesn't miss the opera house. The marvelous sea interludes were played against a series of absract images projected on gauze. The whole effect is of a misty, oppressive, constantly changing sea and the fragility of the lives that try to tame it. This is a beautiful work, beautifully done.",1217462400,31,1237,4.890476190476191
3092000,5,B0012L0TFM,"I just got the DVD and was blown away by it. I saw this performance on TV (black & while, rabbit ears, lots of snow) back around 1970 and had fond memories of it. I'm not sure how much restoration the recording required but the video is very good and the mono audio is fine. Peter Pears, of course, is incomparable and the rest of the cast is superb as are the staging and overall performance.",1216339200,24,393,4.184210526315789
3092011,4,B0012L0TFM,"Having seen all the DVDs, with the exception of Vickers, I was greatly looking forward to this HD version, in spite of a strange feeling that it would lose out to Langridge. A scene by scene comparison with the ENO version - and a review of the other reviews - led to the realization that for me it was going to be simply a case of personal preference. I had discarded Britten's performance because I've never been able to stand Peter Pears voice, although Britten's conducting is superb. So it came down to the ENO or the Met. As always, Runnicles give a superb orchestral  interpretation and Racette is awesome - the only reasons for my giving it four stars. I found Griffey unattractive noisy and a poor actor. The monstrous set was hardly inspiring and the inter-act interviews annoying. So for me, it is Langridge (his performance is inspired - it really choked me up. And the production is  inspiring. My copy, by the way is on laserdisc - I'm assuming the DVD is as good or better.

3092012,3,B0012L0TFM,"An alternate view of the Met Grimes

First of all, why did the Met even bother with a set?  They've given us what is essentially a concert staging with costumes and some movement.  Britten's musical information is totally ignored; e.g., when Balstrode helps Grimes haul in his boat, Britten, who loved Verdi and knew Schubert's songs very well, illustrates in the orchestra and vocal music the straining and pulling at the winch.  In the Met production, however, the two men merely ""stand and deliver"" front stage.  During the second intermission, the director and set designer are both asked how they got their inspiration for this production.  They agreed that it was the story they were considering and they talked a bit about their work in relation to the libretto.  Neither mentioned the music.  (During the same interval, the conductor, in his interview, emphasized Britten's attention to the scenic and psychological in the music.  Was he giving us his opinion of the staging?)  This production doesn't begin to work well with the music until the middle of Act III, scene 1.  Of interest, it is suggested during Peter's ""mad scene"" that he imagines the voices of Ellen and Balstrode (not as interesting psychologically, however, as having Ellen and Balstrode actually with Peter at that point).

As to Griffey's performance, he's certainly excellent vocally, but his conception of Grimes is inconsistant: is he merely childish, a schizophrenic, borderline autistic? Much of the time his acting is obviously that: acting.  He doesn't ""get his act together"" literally until his final scene.  Perhaps he will grow into this role...

Racette is excellent; you may want to buy this DVD for her performance, but there are other superb Ellens on much better CDs (Pears/Britten and Rolfe Johnson/Haitinck, e.g.) and DVD (Langridge/Atherton).  As to the comment on diction by another amazon reviewer, just listen to Heather Harper in the role of Ellen if you want to hear understandable diction.  Plus, everyone's diction on the Langridge DVD is superb.  I didn't understand a single word Auntie's nieces sang (this production), but they come across very clearly on my other recordings.

Something is wrong with the engineering for the Met DVD: balance in volume between orchestra and singers often favors the singers, to the detriment of Britten's orchestral information.  Perhaps the problem is with Runnicles: I noticed some very strange phrasing due to the orchestra slowing or speeding up at times.  Perhaps the placement of chorus and leads has something to do with my disappointment in sound and acting.  As mentioned above, the director and set designer were more concerned with their Concept than with Britten's masterful telling of the story in his music.

Peter Grimes is one of my top ten operas.  I've seen it live in Chicago twice, once with Jon Vickers, once with Ben Heppner.  I saw the Willy Decker production in Brussels twice, with two different Peters.  I have the opera on CD with Peter Pears, Britten himself conducting; with Anthony Rolfe Johnson, Haitinck conducting; and with Philip Langridge, Tate conducting.  I have the opera on DVD with Pears, and with Langridge, Atherton conducting.  I would place any of my five recorded Grimes over this production (which I purchased because I wanted to see Racette in action and because she and Griffey got such rave reviews).  I'm also quite familiar with the Vickers DVD, an especially beautiful production, disappointing only because of Vickers' obtrusive ego.  It is difficult for me to choose my favorite -- they are all so wonderful, but for a DVD performance it's Philip Langridge in Tim Albery's production for the Royal Opera, by far.

I doubt I'll ever watch this DVD again; it simply can't compare to  Pears/Britten on CD or Langridge on DVD.",1271808000,18,3818,5.068910256410256
3092013,5,B0012L0TFM,"Peter Grimes is a difficult opera because it has to be acted as well as sung. This production makes a good case for this being Benjamin Britten's greatest work. In this production both the singing and the acting couldn't be better. This is easily the best production of this opera that I have ever seen.
This is a stunningly good production. The casting is very strong- these singing actors present very believable characters. Anthony Dean Griffey and Patricia Racette give career defining performances. They are supported by uniformly excellent cast, especially Palmer, Michaels-Moore, Grove and Rhodes. The chorus is a very important ""character"" and the MET chorus has never been better.
Donald Runnicles conducts a MET orchestra that presents this wonderful score with stunning beauty.
The claustrophobic sets by Scott Pask, the costumes by Ann Hould-Ward and the direction of John Doyle all work to create a production that left me stunned by it's beauty and moved by the tragic story.",1256256000,3,989,5.149068322981367
3092014,5,B0012L0TFM,"The extras here (Natalie Dessay's amusingly arch introductions; backstage interviews with singers, the maestro, and other personnel) are woven into the performance in chronological order, so that if the viewer watches the DVD straight through, he or she experiences exactly what was seen in the March 2008 HD theater broadcast. I am not sure I would like for this to become standard practice on the new Met DVDs, but then, we all presumably are equipped with a ""track forward"" button. That this is the closest I can come to a quibble is a statement in itself. This is in all ways a towering achievement: a masterly presentation of what must be among the two or three greatest operas composed for our ungrateful English language.

The production by John Doyle, with set designs by Scott Pask, is dark and spare in its look: everything takes place in front of a large, looming wall behind which scaffolding has been erected. Doors placed at various heights open unpredictably by mechanical means to reveal this or that member of the Borough eavesdropping, commenting, judging. To my mind, it works exceptionally well both as symbolism and as establishment of milieu: we are thrust, right along with Peter Grimes and Ellen Orford, into a place where there are no secrets and no privacy, and ultimately there will be neither mercy nor escape. The Borough of Benjamin Britten and librettist Montagu Slater, after George Crabbe's poem of the same name, is just as oppressive, forbidding, and threatening a world, in its fashion, as the Spain of Verdi's DON CARLOS and the Russia of Mussorgsky's BORIS GODUNOV. But lives are not destroyed here by means of pyre or gulag; the deed is accomplished by gossip, half-truth, and the slow suffocation of ambiguity. In this production as elsewhere, Peter Grimes is no innocent, misunderstood victim. We see in his worst moments with Ellen Orford and with his doomed (second) apprentice that he is indeed capable of coarseness, even brutality, and that he is disturbed and tightly coiled. But in the Borough, an outcast's imagined misdeeds are assumed, and his real ones magnified beyond reason. Grimes's tormenters do not inflict his psychic wounds, but they find those wounds and tear at them. Their cruelty hastens him along on his path to isolation and madness, and his only sympathizers, Ellen and Balstrode, ultimately are defeated -- the only option left them is to help Grimes to an end that is as merciful and dignified as possible under the circumstances. The accusers, for all their posturing about standards of community decency and children's welfare, desperately need a Grimes to be their goat, their bogeyman. It is all that prevents them from turning their gaze inward, or on one another. The clergyman and lawyer with their nocturnal drunken sprees and lecherous attacks on young women, the shrill old widow with her addiction to black-market narcotics, would be no objective observer's models of rectitude. Their benighted hypocrisy would seem wicked satire if it we did not encounter its like all around us, every day, whether in our own communities or in what we see and read in the news.

Not a single member of the ensemble fails to adequately serve Britten musically, and here we get an object lesson in how much of a positive difference it can make when everyone looks his or her part as well (this scarcely matters on an audio recording). It is a credit to the Met's casting as well as to Ann Hould-Ward's costume designs. Anthony Michaels-Moore could well *be* a retired sea captain. Felicity Palmer so thoroughly embodies viperous old Mrs. Sedley that it's slightly startling when she abandons that pinched, hardened mien at her final bows; she seems to drop about 20 years. Jill Grove, as the tart-tongued barmaid Auntie, is as astute in the details as she is in the outline; the kernel of her whole performance is in the perfection of that throaty laugh during the Prologue's inquest scene. Auntie's two dubious ""nieces"" (Leah Partridge and Erin Morley) have the youthful beauty to make them entirely plausible as what they are (the drawing cards for Auntie's pub), but they are not merely decorative -- they are real, capable singers. In the lead roles, Patricia Racette and Anthony Dean Griffey give performances that are, in different ways, as moving as any one is likely to find on an opera DVD. Racette finds and communicates the schoolteacher Ellen Orford's decency and feminine strength as well as the trickier aspects of the part, the plaintive undercurrents of loneliness and need. Griffey never loses the through-line of our sympathy in his portrayal of this ambiguous, troublesome protagonist, who is fascinating not in spite of his limitations but because of them. Benjamin Britten famously disliked the grand-scaled Peter Grimes of the great Wagnerian tenor Jon Vickers. We need not share his opinion (I certainly do not), but I wonder what he would have made of Griffey, a big, convincingly intimidating man whose voice is more slender and his interpretation more lyrical than Vickers's -- closer to that of Britten's lifetime companion and the originator of the role, Peter Pears. However, Griffey is both more ingratiating in sound and more reliable in his musicianship than Pears ever was. The entire cast's diction has phenomenal clarity.

The rave would not be complete without acknowledgement of the Met Orchestra and Chorus under the skilled and perceptive guidance of Donald Runnicles. Special mention should be afforded the chorus for its achievements in dynamics. When the mob mentality reaches its (figurative and literal) crescendo on Act III's ""Peter Grimes! Peter Grimes!"" it is absolutely hair-raising. But the choristers are no less effective in quieter moments, such as that haunting final scene, as the Borough begins its new day, having all but forgotten about Peter Grimes. Viewers of this production are unlikely to do the same.",1245283200,8,5926,5.038735983690112
3092015,5,B0012L0TFM,"This television performance of Peter Grimes is the most dramatically intense of all the Grimes's I've seen; and Peter Pears, who quit singing the role after this production, was at his vocal and interpretive peak. We can only surmise that he stopped singing the role because he somehow realized that he could never better himself in this. It was Pears for whom this opera was written, and his unique voice has the perfect eerie plaintiveness for the pathetic and enigmatic Grimes. This is one of the most nuanced and intelligent operatic performances I have ever seen. Heather Harper also brought her considerable best musical and dramatic skills to this enterprise.

I rarely enjoy historic performances in monophonic sound (much to my own detriment, I admit), but this is an exception: the quality and passion of the performance definitely conquer all. (You may find, as I did, that the alternate soundtrack in ""enhanced"" Dolby Digital mono, mitigates the flatness of the pure monophonic sound of the main soundtrack.) Otherwise, the audio is quite good, well balanced with rich bass, and only very slightly constricted and metallic in the high frequencies during the loudest parts - so nearly irrelevant that I hesitate to mention it.",1245110400,,1237,5.093596059113301
3092016,5,B0012L0TFM,"I have owned the Jon Vickers recording since vinyl lp days.  I have heard Metropolitan Saturday broadcasts with Vickers, Philip Langridge, and Anthony Rolfe Johnson.  But, this is the first time I have been privileged to see ""Peter Grimes.""
If I had seen this in the opera house, I would probably have reviewed, ""I did not like it.""  The dark, stark set.  The minimal stage action, mostly people wandering onto the stage, singing, and then wandering off.  Characters popping in and out of what one reviewer called the ""advent calendar"" wall.  The somewhat lengthy orchestral passages, with nothing happening on stage.  I think that I would have found all this tedious and a bit boring.
But, what John Doyle has done, whether he intended to or not, and whether he realizes it or not, is to create an excellent production for video.  The things that would not likely have been apparent to the opera house audience came across vividly on video.
Of course, the music, as usual, was fully Metropolitan quality.  The chorus work superb.  And Donald Runnicles conducted the whole thing masterfully.  His intensity and emotional involvement in the story were well captured by the camera on many occasions.
What made this such an exceptional video are the expressions of the characters, clearly exhibited in closeups.  Bravos to the video director for his choice of camera angles and closeups!  The evolving Peter Grimes, from a troubled soul, moving into the tortured and tormented, really expressed the story Benjamin Britten was trying to tell.
I have never heard Peter Pears sing this role, which was created for him by Britten.  But, in my opinion, Anthony Dean Griffey more fully represented Pears' approach and, I believe, Britten's intentions, than any of the previously mentioned artists.
In my title to this review, I listed the production as a question mark.  For the opera house, the rating would be much lower.  For the video, the 5 star rating definitely applies.",1242432000,3,1968,4.972477064220183
3092017,5,B0012L0TFM,"We can assume that this is as close as we will ever get to how Britten himself conceived the opera within the limits of casting and the attributes of the medium. In and of itself, as seen in the restored version, I never saw the original 1969 BBC production, this is a model for presentation utilizing some modern film technology with stage like scenic design.
Contrary to some reviewers, the question of Peter Pears age never entered my mind. In fact, it seemed perfectly appropriate for the period represented by the opera.
Whatever the undoubted merits of other productions on DVD available, this should be considered a must buy (particularly at the price) for any collection of modern opera. While not flawless, what is, it is classic.",1235779200,2,739,4.826771653543307
3092018,5,B0012L0TFM,"The first viewing of this, one of my favorite operas, worked me up as though I were experiencing it for the first time.  I've seen Vickers, I've heard Pears, I've seen a number of video performance by others (including Chris Ventris who was superb) but Griffey offers the finest Grimes in my experience.  The sweetness and clarity of tone he brings to the role adds a level that enhanced the character to a degree almost unimaginable.  The detail of the acting of each role simply mind boggling and completely believable.  Often one gets tremendous ""acting"" performances which can make me forgive some vocal shortcomings, but here each role was sung with such precision and beauty and music and text wedded sublimely.

I also enjoyed Dessay's introduction, especially just as the performance was ready to
begin as she warns us to settle in for ""the sad, horrible story of Peter Grimes.""

It's a different beast watching it on screen than in the house, (of course), and I wonder if this is one of those productions better served by seeing it on screen than on stage.  As a ""movie"" the set was simply tremendous and a perfect vehicle to display all the many characters that inhabit the Borough.  The screen captures an intimacy not quite possible if one was forced to stare at the set the entire time, our eyes relieved and training on specific details rather than having to pick them out from the ""whole.""  Generally, I'm less
inclined to like this than live, but this one really, really worked.

Patricia Racette is simply stunning as Ellen.  No singer today sings in English like this girl.  Every word, even on some of those (few) high notes was understandable and filled with meaning.  I loved what she talked about during her interview of being able to sing in her native tongue and be able to put across the subtexts which isn't always possible - or
at least as ""natural"" as when singing in a foreign language.  Her face displayed every emotion as well as her voice, her body language strong and sure.  This was not wilting violet (not that I'm accusing any of the many wonderful Ellen's I've seen were) but she brought a force of strength from the get go.  Her standing up to the community at the beginning was powerful, powerful music theatre - just riveting.  My friends who went with me have never seen her before and my buddy's wife commented ""I couldn't take my eyes off of her . . . and that voice, oh my God!""

I kept hearing that Teddy Tahu Rhodes stole every scene he was in, and I was thrilled to see pretty much the case today.  His Ned was terrific.  I've liked this guy for a little while now and it's wicked fun seeing him make such a strong debut at the Met!

Jill Groves as Auntie was right up there as well.  What a big, sexy gal she is and her mannerisms, voice, costume, everything was the perfect Auntie.

Mr. Michaels Moore has been bumpy for me throughout the number of times I've seen and heard him, but I always like him.  Today was one of the best performances I've heard from this guy - tremendous.

I'm becoming, more and more, a huge fan of Mr. Del Carlo and it's fun to see him in a number of these Met outings.  Those mutton chops today almost stole the show!

Runnicles.  Wow.  What an amazing way he has with this score, living and breathing it and getting from that amazing orchestra a superb, thrilling reading.  Every nuance and detail was breathtaking - from the ""hurly burly"" wild moments to the most hushed and introspective sounding.

There are too many moments to single out when something comes through as perfectly as did this.

The chorus. Holy Smoke! They were astonishing in every single detail. This is one of those ""chorus"" operas and the Met should be justifiably proud of the work Mr. Palumbo has done.

I tried not to cry, and held up well during the big ""Grimes"" chorus, but Griffey's mad scene opened up the floodgates.  To see him tears in his eyes mixing with his sweat rolling down his face, I pulled away for a millisecond and back to reality thinking ""this guy really thinks he's Peter Grimes.""  Well, so did I!

The intermission feature includes a brief trip to Aldeborough who were receiving their first Met cinemeacast - when this HD presentation first aired.  We go along the nearby beaches as well as the Britten/Pears house.  It was powerfully moving to catch sight of their unadorned graves with their simple headstones in the graveyard.

This DVD jumps to the head of the list!  Highly recommended.",1229644800,25,4469,4.579345088161209
3092019,5,B0012L0TFM,"I first saw this production of Peter Grimes when the Met broadcast it to movie theatres in March and vowed I would purchase the DVD when it became available.

3092020,5,B0012L0TFM,"The Met's HD production of ""Peter Grimes"" packs a lot of power and brings the brooding musicality of Benjamin Britten's 1945 operatic masterwork to life. The cast is uniformly fine vocally and dramatically, though people who remember Jon Vickers in his full-voiced portrayal of the titular anti-hero may find Anthony Dean Griffey's tenor light and reedy by comparison. Nonetheless, he is compelling in his portrayal of Grime's anguished internal pre-occupations, and the rest of the cast brings theatrical and vocal specificity to their roles as inhabitants of The Borough. Patricia Racette gives a heart-wrenching performance as Ellen Orford, the widowed school mistress who tries to befriend the embattled Peter. John Doyle's stage direction is strong in developing the characters, and in maximizing the dramatic impact of the choruses, but is often rendered static by the constraints of the uniwall black on black set. The real heroes, though, are conductor Donald Runnicles and the incomparable Met orchestra, who capture Britten's miraculous sonic evocation of the sea and its parallel storms in the minds of those who, like the fisherman Grimes, try to eke out a precarious livelihood from it.",1224547200,12,1199,5.382978723404255

3326496,5,B0012L0TFM,"How very lucky we are to have the release of the TV movie version dated 1969 of Britten's Peter Grimes. All the more so because we have the composer Benjamin Britten conducting and his partner Peter Pears who created the title role of Peter in what is certainly one of the greatest operas of the twentieth century. Pears projection of the character is superb; a troubled, confused yet resolute individual trying to fit in the village. The excellent Heather Harper as Ellen tries to reach Peter but can't. Ann Robson is commendable as the opium-dazed Mrs. Sedley  the village gossip who with the drunk, failed Methodist minister Bob Boles turns the village against Grimes. All the singer/actors are very well cast. Because of the constraints of time and space, the opera had to be filmed in very small quarters on an adaptable, rotational ramp set cleverly conceived by David Myerscough-Jones. So well done that it belies the crampted space and one doesn't miss the opera house. The marvelous sea interludes were played against a series of absract images projected on gauze. The whole effect is of a misty, oppressive, constantly changing sea and the fragility of the lives that try to tame it. This is a beautiful work, beautifully done.",1217462400,31,1237,4.890476190476191

I'm not sure how much restoration the recording required but the video is very good and the mono audio is fine. Peter Pears, of course, is incomparable and the rest of the cast is superb as are the staging and overall performance.",1216339200,24,393,4.184210526315789
3326508,4,B0012L0TFM,"Having seen all the DVDs, with the exception of Vickers, I was greatly looking forward to this HD version, in spite of a strange feeling that it would lose out to Langridge. A scene by scene comparison with the ENO version - and a review of the other reviews - led to the realization that for me it was going to be simply a case of personal preference. I had discarded Britten's performance because I've never been able to stand Peter Pears voice, although Britten's conducting is superb. So it came down to the ENO or the Met. As always, Runnicles give a superb orchestral  interpretation and Racette is awesome - the only reasons for my giving it four stars. I found Griffey unattractive noisy and a poor actor. The monstrous set was hardly inspiring and the inter-act interviews annoying. So for me, it is Langridge (his performance is inspired - it really choked me up. And the production is  inspiring. My copy, by the way is on laserdisc - I'm assuming the DVD is as good or better.

3326509,3,B0012L0TFM,"An alternate view of the Met Grimes

First of all, why did the Met even bother with a set?  They've given us what is essentially a concert staging with costumes and some movement.  Britten's musical information is totally ignored; e.g., when Balstrode helps Grimes haul in his boat, Britten, who loved Verdi and knew Schubert's songs very well, illustrates in the orchestra and vocal music the straining and pulling at the winch.  In the Met production, however, the two men merely ""stand and deliver"" front stage.  During the second intermission, the director and set designer are both asked how they got their inspiration for this production.  They agreed that it was the story they were considering and they talked a bit about their work in relation to the libretto.  Neither mentioned the music.  (During the same interval, the conductor, in his interview, emphasized Britten's attention to the scenic and psychological in the music.  Was he giving us his opinion of the staging?)  This production doesn't begin to work well with the music until the middle of Act III, scene 1.  Of interest, it is suggested during Peter's ""mad scene"" that he imagines the voices of Ellen and Balstrode (not as interesting psychologically, however, as having Ellen and Balstrode actually with Peter at that point).

As to Griffey's performance, he's certainly excellent vocally, but his conception of Grimes is inconsistant: is he merely childish, a schizophrenic, borderline autistic? Much of the time his acting is obviously that: acting.  He doesn't ""get his act together"" literally until his final scene.  Perhaps he will grow into this role...

Racette is excellent; you may want to buy this DVD for her performance, but there are other superb Ellens on much better CDs (Pears/Britten and Rolfe Johnson/Haitinck, e.g.) and DVD (Langridge/Atherton).  As to the comment on diction by another amazon reviewer, just listen to Heather Harper in the role of Ellen if you want to hear understandable diction.  Plus, everyone's diction on the Langridge DVD is superb.  I didn't understand a single word Auntie's nieces sang (this production), but they come across very clearly on my other recordings.

Something is wrong with the engineering for the Met DVD: balance in volume between orchestra and singers often favors the singers, to the detriment of Britten's orchestral information.  Perhaps the problem is with Runnicles: I noticed some very strange phrasing due to the orchestra slowing or speeding up at times.  Perhaps the placement of chorus and leads has something to do with my disappointment in sound and acting.  As mentioned above, the director and set designer were more concerned with their Concept than with Britten's masterful telling of the story in his music.

Peter Grimes is one of my top ten operas.  I've seen it live in Chicago twice, once with Jon Vickers, once with Ben Heppner.  I saw the Willy Decker production in Brussels twice, with two different Peters.  I have the opera on CD with Peter Pears, Britten himself conducting; with Anthony Rolfe Johnson, Haitinck conducting; and with Philip Langridge, Tate conducting.  I have the opera on DVD with Pears, and with Langridge, Atherton conducting.  I would place any of my five recorded Grimes over this production (which I purchased because I wanted to see Racette in action and because she and Griffey got such rave reviews).  I'm also quite familiar with the Vickers DVD, an especially beautiful production, disappointing only because of Vickers' obtrusive ego.  It is difficult for me to choose my favorite -- they are all so wonderful, but for a DVD performance it's Philip Langridge in Tim Albery's production for the Royal Opera, by far.

I doubt I'll ever watch this DVD again; it simply can't compare to  Pears/Britten on CD or Langridge on DVD.",1271808000,18,3818,5.068910256410256
3326510,5,B0012L0TFM,"Peter Grimes is a difficult opera because it has to be acted as well as sung. This production makes a good case for this being Benjamin Britten's greatest work. In this production both the singing and the acting couldn't be better. This is easily the best production of this opera that I have ever seen.
This is a stunningly good production. The casting is very strong- these singing actors present very believable characters. Anthony Dean Griffey and Patricia Racette give career defining performances. They are supported by uniformly excellent cast, especially Palmer, Michaels-Moore, Grove and Rhodes. The chorus is a very important ""character"" and the MET chorus has never been better.
Donald Runnicles conducts a MET orchestra that presents this wonderful score with stunning beauty.
The claustrophobic sets by Scott Pask, the costumes by Ann Hould-Ward and the direction of John Doyle all work to create a production that left me stunned by it's beauty and moved by the tragic story.",1256256000,3,989,5.149068322981367
3326511,5,B0012L0TFM,"The extras here (Natalie Dessay's amusingly arch introductions; backstage interviews with singers, the maestro, and other personnel) are woven into the performance in chronological order, so that if the viewer watches the DVD straight through, he or she experiences exactly what was seen in the March 2008 HD theater broadcast. I am not sure I would like for this to become standard practice on the new Met DVDs, but then, we all presumably are equipped with a ""track forward"" button. That this is the closest I can come to a quibble is a statement in itself. This is in all ways a towering achievement: a masterly presentation of what must be among the two or three greatest operas composed for our ungrateful English language.

The production by John Doyle, with set designs by Scott Pask, is dark and spare in its look: everything takes place in front of a large, looming wall behind which scaffolding has been erected. Doors placed at various heights open unpredictably by mechanical means to reveal this or that member of the Borough eavesdropping, commenting, judging. To my mind, it works exceptionally well both as symbolism and as establishment of milieu: we are thrust, right along with Peter Grimes and Ellen Orford, into a place where there are no secrets and no privacy, and ultimately there will be neither mercy nor escape. The Borough of Benjamin Britten and librettist Montagu Slater, after George Crabbe's poem of the same name, is just as oppressive, forbidding, and threatening a world, in its fashion, as the Spain of Verdi's DON CARLOS and the Russia of Mussorgsky's BORIS GODUNOV. But lives are not destroyed here by means of pyre or gulag; the deed is accomplished by gossip, half-truth, and the slow suffocation of ambiguity. In this production as elsewhere, Peter Grimes is no innocent, misunderstood victim. We see in his worst moments with Ellen Orford and with his doomed (second) apprentice that he is indeed capable of coarseness, even brutality, and that he is disturbed and tightly coiled. But in the Borough, an outcast's imagined misdeeds are assumed, and his real ones magnified beyond reason. Grimes's tormenters do not inflict his psychic wounds, but they find those wounds and tear at them. Their cruelty hastens him along on his path to isolation and madness, and his only sympathizers, Ellen and Balstrode, ultimately are defeated -- the only option left them is to help Grimes to an end that is as merciful and dignified as possible under the circumstances. The accusers, for all their posturing about standards of community decency and children's welfare, desperately need a Grimes to be their goat, their bogeyman. It is all that prevents them from turning their gaze inward, or on one another. The clergyman and lawyer with their nocturnal drunken sprees and lecherous attacks on young women, the shrill old widow with her addiction to black-market narcotics, would be no objective observer's models of rectitude. Their benighted hypocrisy would seem wicked satire if it we did not encounter its like all around us, every day, whether in our own communities or in what we see and read in the news.

Not a single member of the ensemble fails to adequately serve Britten musically, and here we get an object lesson in how much of a positive difference it can make when everyone looks his or her part as well (this scarcely matters on an audio recording). It is a credit to the Met's casting as well as to Ann Hould-Ward's costume designs. Anthony Michaels-Moore could well *be* a retired sea captain. Felicity Palmer so thoroughly embodies viperous old Mrs. Sedley that it's slightly startling when she abandons that pinched, hardened mien at her final bows; she seems to drop about 20 years. Jill Grove, as the tart-tongued barmaid Auntie, is as astute in the details as she is in the outline; the kernel of her whole performance is in the perfection of that throaty laugh during the Prologue's inquest scene. Auntie's two dubious ""nieces"" (Leah Partridge and Erin Morley) have the youthful beauty to make them entirely plausible as what they are (the drawing cards for Auntie's pub), but they are not merely decorative -- they are real, capable singers. In the lead roles, Patricia Racette and Anthony Dean Griffey give performances that are, in different ways, as moving as any one is likely to find on an opera DVD. Racette finds and communicates the schoolteacher Ellen Orford's decency and feminine strength as well as the trickier aspects of the part, the plaintive undercurrents of loneliness and need. Griffey never loses the through-line of our sympathy in his portrayal of this ambiguous, troublesome protagonist, who is fascinating not in spite of his limitations but because of them. Benjamin Britten famously disliked the grand-scaled Peter Grimes of the great Wagnerian tenor Jon Vickers. We need not share his opinion (I certainly do not), but I wonder what he would have made of Griffey, a big, convincingly intimidating man whose voice is more slender and his interpretation more lyrical than Vickers's -- closer to that of Britten's lifetime companion and the originator of the role, Peter Pears. However, Griffey is both more ingratiating in sound and more reliable in his musicianship than Pears ever was. The entire cast's diction has phenomenal clarity.

The rave would not be complete without acknowledgement of the Met Orchestra and Chorus under the skilled and perceptive guidance of Donald Runnicles. Special mention should be afforded the chorus for its achievements in dynamics. When the mob mentality reaches its (figurative and literal) crescendo on Act III's ""Peter Grimes! Peter Grimes!"" it is absolutely hair-raising. But the choristers are no less effective in quieter moments, such as that haunting final scene, as the Borough begins its new day, having all but forgotten about Peter Grimes. Viewers of this production are unlikely to do the same.",1245283200,8,5926,5.038735983690112
3326512,5,B0012L0TFM,"This television performance of Peter Grimes is the most dramatically intense of all the Grimes's I've seen; and Peter Pears, who quit singing the role after this production, was at his vocal and interpretive peak. We can only surmise that he stopped singing the role because he somehow realized that he could never better himself in this. It was Pears for whom this opera was written, and his unique voice has the perfect eerie plaintiveness for the pathetic and enigmatic Grimes. This is one of the most nuanced and intelligent operatic performances I have ever seen. Heather Harper also brought her considerable best musical and dramatic skills to this enterprise.

I rarely enjoy historic performances in monophonic sound (much to my own detriment, I admit), but this is an exception: the quality and passion of the performance definitely conquer all. (You may find, as I did, that the alternate soundtrack in ""enhanced"" Dolby Digital mono, mitigates the flatness of the pure monophonic sound of the main soundtrack.) Otherwise, the audio is quite good, well balanced with rich bass, and only very slightly constricted and metallic in the high frequencies during the loudest parts - so nearly irrelevant that I hesitate to mention it.",1245110400,,1237,5.093596059113301
3326513,5,B0012L0TFM,"I have owned the Jon Vickers recording since vinyl lp days.  I have heard Metropolitan Saturday broadcasts with Vickers, Philip Langridge, and Anthony Rolfe Johnson.  But, this is the first time I have been privileged to see ""Peter Grimes.""
If I had seen this in the opera house, I would probably have reviewed, ""I did not like it.""  The dark, stark set.  The minimal stage action, mostly people wandering onto the stage, singing, and then wandering off.  Characters popping in and out of what one reviewer called the ""advent calendar"" wall.  The somewhat lengthy orchestral passages, with nothing happening on stage.  I think that I would have found all this tedious and a bit boring.
But, what John Doyle has done, whether he intended to or not, and whether he realizes it or not, is to create an excellent production for video.  The things that would not likely have been apparent to the opera house audience came across vividly on video.
Of course, the music, as usual, was fully Metropolitan quality.  The chorus work superb.  And Donald Runnicles conducted the whole thing masterfully.  His intensity and emotional involvement in the story were well captured by the camera on many occasions.
What made this such an exceptional video are the expressions of the characters, clearly exhibited in closeups.  Bravos to the video director for his choice of camera angles and closeups!  The evolving Peter Grimes, from a troubled soul, moving into the tortured and tormented, really expressed the story Benjamin Britten was trying to tell.
I have never heard Peter Pears sing this role, which was created for him by Britten.  But, in my opinion, Anthony Dean Griffey more fully represented Pears' approach and, I believe, Britten's intentions, than any of the previously mentioned artists.
In my title to this review, I listed the production as a question mark.  For the opera house, the rating would be much lower.  For the video, the 5 star rating definitely applies.",1242432000,3,1968,4.972477064220183
3326514,5,B0012L0TFM,"We can assume that this is as close as we will ever get to how Britten himself conceived the opera within the limits of casting and the attributes of the medium. In and of itself, as seen in the restored version, I never saw the original 1969 BBC production, this is a model for presentation utilizing some modern film technology with stage like scenic design.
Contrary to some reviewers, the question of Peter Pears age never entered my mind. In fact, it seemed perfectly appropriate for the period represented by the opera.
Whatever the undoubted merits of other productions on DVD available, this should be considered a must buy (particularly at the price) for any collection of modern opera. While not flawless, what is, it is classic.",1235779200,2,739,4.826771653543307
3326515,5,B0012L0TFM,"The first viewing of this, one of my favorite operas, worked me up as though I were experiencing it for the first time.  I've seen Vickers, I've heard Pears, I've seen a number of video performance by others (including Chris Ventris who was superb) but Griffey offers the finest Grimes in my experience.  The sweetness and clarity of tone he brings to the role adds a level that enhanced the character to a degree almost unimaginable.  The detail of the acting of each role simply mind boggling and completely believable.  Often one gets tremendous ""acting"" performances which can make me forgive some vocal shortcomings, but here each role was sung with such precision and beauty and music and text wedded sublimely.

I also enjoyed Dessay's introduction, especially just as the performance was ready to
begin as she warns us to settle in for ""the sad, horrible story of Peter Grimes.""

It's a different beast watching it on screen than in the house, (of course), and I wonder if this is one of those productions better served by seeing it on screen than on stage.  As a ""movie"" the set was simply tremendous and a perfect vehicle to display all the many characters that inhabit the Borough.  The screen captures an intimacy not quite possible if one was forced to stare at the set the entire time, our eyes relieved and training on specific details rather than having to pick them out from the ""whole.""  Generally, I'm less
inclined to like this than live, but this one really, really worked.

Patricia Racette is simply stunning as Ellen.  No singer today sings in English like this girl.  Every word, even on some of those (few) high notes was understandable and filled with meaning.  I loved what she talked about during her interview of being able to sing in her native tongue and be able to put across the subtexts which isn't always possible - or
at least as ""natural"" as when singing in a foreign language.  Her face displayed every emotion as well as her voice, her body language strong and sure.  This was not wilting violet (not that I'm accusing any of the many wonderful Ellen's I've seen were) but she brought a force of strength from the get go.  Her standing up to the community at the beginning was powerful, powerful music theatre - just riveting.  My friends who went with me have never seen her before and my buddy's wife commented ""I couldn't take my eyes off of her . . . and that voice, oh my God!""

I kept hearing that Teddy Tahu Rhodes stole every scene he was in, and I was thrilled to see pretty much the case today.  His Ned was terrific.  I've liked this guy for a little while now and it's wicked fun seeing him make such a strong debut at the Met!

Jill Groves as Auntie was right up there as well.  What a big, sexy gal she is and her mannerisms, voice, costume, everything was the perfect Auntie.

Mr. Michaels Moore has been bumpy for me throughout the number of times I've seen and heard him, but I always like him.  Today was one of the best performances I've heard from this guy - tremendous.

I'm becoming, more and more, a huge fan of Mr. Del Carlo and it's fun to see him in a number of these Met outings.  Those mutton chops today almost stole the show!

Runnicles.  Wow.  What an amazing way he has with this score, living and breathing it and getting from that amazing orchestra a superb, thrilling reading.  Every nuance and detail was breathtaking - from the ""hurly burly"" wild moments to the most hushed and introspective sounding.

There are too many moments to single out when something comes through as perfectly as did this.

The chorus. Holy Smoke! They were astonishing in every single detail. This is one of those ""chorus"" operas and the Met should be justifiably proud of the work Mr. Palumbo has done.

I tried not to cry, and held up well during the big ""Grimes"" chorus, but Griffey's mad scene opened up the floodgates.  To see him tears in his eyes mixing with his sweat rolling down his face, I pulled away for a millisecond and back to reality thinking ""this guy really thinks he's Peter Grimes.""  Well, so did I!

The intermission feature includes a brief trip to Aldeborough who were receiving their first Met cinemeacast - when this HD presentation first aired.  We go along the nearby beaches as well as the Britten/Pears house.  It was powerfully moving to catch sight of their unadorned graves with their simple headstones in the graveyard.

The cast is uniformly fine vocally and dramatically, though people who remember Jon Vickers in his full-voiced portrayal of the titular anti-hero may find Anthony Dean Griffey's tenor light and reedy by comparison. Nonetheless, he is compelling in his portrayal of Grime's anguished internal pre-occupations, and the rest of the cast brings theatrical and vocal specificity to their roles as inhabitants of The Borough. Patricia Racette gives a heart-wrenching performance as Ellen Orford, the widowed school mistress who tries to befriend the embattled Peter. John Doyle's stage direction is strong in developing the characters, and in maximizing the dramatic impact of the choruses, but is often rendered static by the constraints of the uniwall black on black set. The real heroes, though, are conductor Donald Runnicles and the incomparable Met orchestra, who capture Britten's miraculous sonic evocation of the sea and its parallel storms in the minds of those who, like the fisherman Grimes, try to eke out a precarious livelihood from it.",1224547200,12,1199,5.382978723404255

At first, I was a bit concerned that it was monaural sound, but my worries quickly vanished as I began to hear nuances that I never heard in the LONDON/DECCA recording... the conducting, by Britten, was more emboldened in this production... with slight variations in tempo, and some added ""uumph"" in the orchestra and chorus (spec. the section ""Summon the Borough to Grimes' hut"" scene where the orchestra kicks the dynamics up a few notches).

8246640,3,B0012L0TFM,"Like some of the other reviewers I found this to be yet another drab wall production from the Met (we saw in person their Flying Dutchman like this, black and white and with doors etc - that didn't work either!). It doesn't help our understanding of the work, fortunately the diction is superb and the video close ups mostly helpful. One of the problems with HD live and similar broadcasts seems to be a keenness to get unnaturally close up. This means the singers have to be superb actors, they all manage this fairly well but it further adds to the feeling that England and the English seaside is entirely Dickensian drab and the music and the fact of the matter state otherwise! Quite a few singers are not well lit however, an absence of footlights in some cases or simply too much drab to reflect light from the floor to their faces. Then others picked out in spot lights! The more I watch and type the worse it gets....I have no especial dislike of minimal stagings providing they work - this doesn't! So listen and glance over the laptop and its fine!

I bought this on special and frankly think it more than worth the price paid, however my wife won't watch it, far too drab! Musical interludes focusing on the conductor and orchestra and dimmed auditorium rather than a light visualization or similar projected onto the stage/curtains say it all as far as the staging goes. There are endless examples but I have never been into a tavern like the one envisaged here...getting it right for the period and location would have helped heaps! As another said I can't imagine how dreadful this would have been sitting in the House. New York what happened?

This said the picture quality and sound are fine, though there is a slight emphasis on voices than orchestra but thats HD Live all over! One can't help thinking someone let the techno-children loose on this production and of course it shows!

I thought the pit and off stage stuff etc after act 1 extensively intrusive...they should be at the end in the DVD specials file not straight after act 1. Dessay asking what Grimes thinks is the truth leads to the ending and fortunately Giffney doesn't let on! Her charming French accent slaughters Aldebrugh several times! Giffney although a light tenor is in my view better than the always over stretched Pears! I was surprised to hear they modeled stuff on Hastings in the UK, I remember the fishing huts there, they are not in any sense connected to Suffolk, its a different sea and fishing technique employed!

No one could color the vocal line and character like Pears, and though he was older when this was recorded, he still sounds fresh vocally for the part of the troubled fisherman.

8246642,5,B0012L0TFM,"That's what it says right on the box, and for a change I enthusiastically agree. Everything works together in this opera - the dramaturgy and the music - to fulfill the fundamental objective of the genre, a total synthesis of words, music, and theatrics. Likewise, everything works in this production, a film made for BBC broadcast in 1969, in color, staged and recorded in a small studio, conducted by Britten himself and starring Britten's long-time collaborator Peter Pears. I have two other DVDs of this extraordinary opera, both of them quite good, but this production is iconic, a supernova of affective art. Yes, ""modern"" opera is valid!

Peter Pears created the role of 'Peter Grimes' in the premiere of the opera on stage. Grimes is a rough, hard-bitten, antipathetic fisherman, ostracized by his community for his cruelty and abuse of his boy apprentice. In fact, he is suspected of having murdered the boy by mistreatment. The drama begins with a coroner's inquest, which rules that the boy's death was accidental. Grimes is defended, and loved, by the schoolmistress Ellen Orford, who helps him acquire another boy from the workhouse-orphanage. The role of Orford is sung magnificently here by Heather Harper; her presence and voice, and the lyrical music written for that presence, is as warm as sunshine bursting through a drenching rain.

The scenes of the opera are all in the village: on the wharf, in the street, inside the local brothel, and in Grimes's hut. These are clearly 'sets' such as might be used in an opera house production, giving us the illusion of the living stage. The BBC deserves all reverence and adulation for pioneering the genre of opera films and operas on TV. Hurray for public broadcasting! Hurray for government patronage of the arts!

I've recently watched all four of the filmed BBC productions of Britten's operas -- Owen Wingrave, The Beggar's Opera, Billy Budd, and Peter Grimes -- and I've been dissatisfied with Owen and Billy, especially with the latter. Basically, I don't find the vocal lines in either of those operas convincing as music. I have other objections to Britten's treatment of the Billy Budd story, which I've expressed in a separate review. What astounds me is that Grimes and Budd incorporate so many of the same themes, so much of the same musical idiom and  theatrical ambience, yet Grimes is a richer and more powerful opera in every way. Both works are 'symphonic' operas, in which the orchestra narrates the emotional drama as much as, or more than, the singers. There are long orchestral interludes between the swiftly-changing scenes of Peter Grimes, and they are in effect profound meditations on the action. Britten's setting of words in Billy Budd seems to me to be awkwardly prosaic, ponderous, arbitrarily bludgeoned on the surface of the orchestral music. That's not at all the case in Peter Grimes; the vocal lines nestle in the symphonic score as naturally as naked bodies in a warm bed. The libretto consists chiefly of rhymed couplets - trimeters and tetrameters - and yet the language never seems jingly or goofy, as it does in Billy Budd. This is language that wants to be sung.

There's an immense tempestuous grandeur to this opera, as grand as the earth-scouring man-devouring sea that looms behind the scenes and the story. Peter Grimes is more than Britten's masterpiece; it's one of the masterpieces of all 20th C opera.",1295308800,7,3414,4.951134380453752
8246643,2,B0012L0TFM,"Thankfully, I rented this DVD rather than purchased it. I agree with the ""birdwalker"" review. This is largely a concert performance in costume. And what a shame. With the vast staging resources of the Met on hand, inspired settings could have been created. Instead we are forced into a two-dimensional perspective for most of the opera by a vast wall with opening doors and windows towering over the cast. One is irresistibly reminded of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In wall with opening panels for delivering comedic quips. This one-size-fits-all-scenes backdrop is tiresome and not only ruins the believability of the performance, but further limits what little movement there ever is on stage. The chorus and actors tend to remain in static poses, facing the audience in concert fashion.  There is no sense that these are people of a close-knit community who have jobs to do. This, I'm sorry, is not opera. I get the impression that the entire production was thrown together on the fly. The Pears, Vickers, and Langridge DVD performances are infinitely better staged. Seems to me that Scott Pask, the set designer, conceived a one trick pony idea and attempted to make it work for the entire drama. It doesn't. A sadly missed opportunity for the Met.",1292716800,6,1249,4.976076555023924
8246644,5,B0012L0TFM,"An opera like this one is surprising in many ways but this is a special BBC production of 1969 and I would like to insist first on the tremendous qualities of this production.

The first element is the setting. It is a complete village square surrounded by wooden houses all raised over the ground with outside staircases to go up to the main doors, whats more on the flank of some steep rising shore. These raised houses insist on the danger the sea represents when a tidal wave or a storm comes up to the coast. All made of wood. That's a brilliant idea and yet it is entirely unrealistic. It wants to be out of time and set in a past that could make the story plausible, a past we can evaluate to be the 18th or the beginning of the 19th century. That village looks like a pioneering settlement in New England in the 17th century, a puritan settlement in a way where everyone is meddling with the business of all others because they are locked away from the world, and their only entertainment is to gossip and accuse the one they don't like of all abominable crimes, and thats Peter Grimes.

The second element is the house of Peter Grimes, or hut if you prefer. It looks like an upturned ship hull, a dream for many seamen who want to live on the earth as if they were on their boats. It is not without recalling some other uses of that concept, and in a way it reminds me of Moby Dick and of the whale which swallowed Jonas. Here the boat is swallowing the seaman even on earth. But it is Peter Grimes house which means he lives in an upside down sea world, in a shipwrecked boat ready to sink. This image is a very sad and grim vision.

The third positive point is the use of crowds. The chorus is not in anyway set aside or gathered in one place, even a changing place on the stage. The chorus singers are dressed like normal sea fishermen and sailors and their wives the same, and they are moving as if they were a real crowd and that gives a good illusion of the mass movements of an at times hostile crowd when they are more or less chasing Peter Grimes, rather more than less.

The fourth point is the very clear distinction between the officials of the village and that crowd. They move alone and not along with a mass of people and they are dressed in a slightly different way. The lawyer and mayor for example with his red coat, or Ellen, the widowed school-teacher, with a knitted sweater and a big brooch. There is thus a clear distinction between the important people and the common people, on top of the fact that the former are the soloists.

The story is of course what is essential in that opera that is telling us a story. It is a very bleak story. Peter Grimes, a solitary sailor, needs an apprentice and he takes orphans from the workhouse in the next but rather distant city. The profession of fisherman is a very difficult profession with many hazards and we could say it is not a profession for children of let's say 10, or even 12, or 14 as for that. What's more Peter Grimes seems to be rather rough and careless. In other words his apprentices seem to die by accident in a rather repetitive way. Helped by Ellen at first, he is abandoned by her when she discovers that the new apprentice is being brutalized. One day when trying to run away from the hostile crowd climbing up to his hut, the new apprentice slips and falls off the cliff to his death. Peter Grimes hides away for a couple of days but he has to come back and there a retired merchant captain gives him the only piece of advice that would pacify the village: take your boat, go out at sea and sink the boat and yourself. And he does it.

The story is depicting a brutal world that is not so much so physically, but I would say socially. The people are meddling with their neighbors' business all the time, creating tension and stress and pushing people to the brink of sanity and causing over-reactions more than anything else. This is perfectly rendered in this production.

But there is an aspect of this story that has to be emphasized because it is a repetitive pattern in many operas. A poor boy abandoned by society and surviving in a workhouse (which refers to at the latest the 19th century) is bought by Peter Grimes to be his apprentice on his ship. Apparently his apprentices systematically die. The opera starts with the trial of the latest victim, but the Lawyer and Mayor who presides over the court shortens the debate and declares the death occurred in accidental circumstances to the high disagreement of the population of the shipping village because there will be no real trial.

We discover that an old spinster is playing the role of the moralistic and ethical accuser in the village in the name of God of course. Her campaign is effective because Peter Grimes lives alone in a hut higher up on the cliff. His hut is an upside down ship hull. He is in a relation with the widow who serves as the local teacher, Ellen Orford. She intervenes to soften the villagers feelings when the carter is asked to bring the next boy to Peter Grimes from the workhouse since he is going to the town, and he refuses to do it not to be the accomplice of a murder. She actually goes with him to make sure. The boy is delivered in the evening: he looks frightened and completely lost, which is normal after all since he is now an uprooted child from an institution where he was already uprooted, meaning with no parents, and exploited, meaning severely. We all think of Dickens and Oliver Twist.

But there will be no escape, no redemption, no salvation for that boy. Thats an important trait in Benjamin Brittens operas: such uprooted boys will not find any good Samaritan who would take them under their protection. This twist is amplified by the hostility of the village against Peter Grimes. He is perceived as a loner, and a busy one at that, who is trying to do better than he should, fish more than he should, even go out on Sunday when everyone is resting since it is the day of the Lord. They perceive him as looking down upon them. And when they start their move towards lynching Peter Grimes they sing at the end Him who despises us we will destroy. In other words he is the stranger they reject because he does not live like them: he does not come to the pub to drink and take advantage of the nieces of the Auntie who is taking care of the pub-cum-inn where the sailors can rest-cum-entertain. And to make more money, to be able to step up in his life to some better future, he buys boys instead of working with another sailor who would be a partner or an employee.

This man rejected by everyone is also a pattern in Benjamin Brittens operas and it is easy to relate this pattern to the personal life experience of the composer. We are of course not implying Benjamin Britten is projecting his personal life into his operas, hence his emotional and sentimental frustration in this society that rejects him, and Peter Pears at the same time, but we say Benjamin Britten has a direct and personal experience of this social rejection anyone can be the victim of for any reason at hand in the homogenized single collective mind of a crowd. Every single member of this crowd might be pretty nice in private but the crowd creates the lynching and pogromming monster in every single one of us when the opportunity is right in front of our door, but here it is not ethnic cleansing but social cleansing.

This double estrangement in this opera is fascinating. The boy is estranged from society by successive uprootings that lead him to death in a way or another, the first one at the beginning of thirst, and the second one at the end of a big fall, like Humpty Dumpty who had a great fall. The man is estranged from the village and from society by his ambition that makes him appear as superior, ambition that will not be fulfilled, satisfied, realized. And the context itself is an estrangement for everyone or nearly: a sailor in his ship is alone and his home, as Peter Grimes says at the end before his own end, is deep in the sea and it is deep in the sea that he will end along with his ship, on the advice of the retired merchant skipper, Captain Balstrode. In other words the end is the reenactment of the walking of the plank of old shipping traditions: death penalty at sea.

All this makes this opera poignant and mind-raking. Is humanity that ugly?

But there is of course the music and that is of course a great if not the greatest element in the opera. The music never ceases, except one a capella duet, and is always dramatic in its movements up and down in the most logical and yet surprising ways, half a tone here and there turns minor the most logical major sentence, suspends it in thin air, in fear and awe. We cannot really know what is coming and the notes are thus separated one from the others as if the strings of notes were in fact successions of unlinked notes creating an effect of total outlandish isolation at times. This builds in the solos a strange feeling of distance, of something lurking in-between the notes, something menacing us constantly. That tone and atmosphere finds its acme with the choruses. The various chorus-singers sing together but most of the times along lines and patterns that are crisscrossing one another to give that impression of a hostile crowd no one can stop or dominate. There is one exception to that disorder. It is the early duet of Ellen Orford and Peter Grimes when they plan some kind of common future with the new child to come. It is sung for its major part a capella and the sentences are perfectly superimposed one onto the other with only the pronouns changing: a dual unison more than a duet, and yet a duet because we feel this unity is highly endangered. The contrast between this messy and meddling crowd as long as Peter Grimes is alive and the sudden total ignorance and forgetfulness once he is gone, meaning dead, is of course striking thanks to that use of the music to build a dangerous and menacing environment.
