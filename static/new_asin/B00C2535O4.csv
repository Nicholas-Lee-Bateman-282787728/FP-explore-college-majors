8576361,5,B00C2535O4,"This is a story about a young couple who decide to marry under the condition that they agree never to disagree. The contract states that ""Never to be husband and wife, but lover and mistress and above everything else, to remain individual."" But this agreement does not stand the test of time. When Nicholas Randall (Laurence Olivier) is vacationing alone in Cannes, France  cheats on his wife Judy (Gloria Swanson) and later begs for forgiveness. The divorce case heads to the court and there the drama ends in much unexpected way. Judy agrees to forgive Nicholas and they elope from the court proceedings. The court has no choice but to dismiss the case and it all ends in a very happy note.

For most silent movie buffs like me, it is refreshing to watch this movie, since Gloria Swanson made very few talkie movies. The most striking feature of the movie is Swanson working with Laurence Olivier who was eight years younger than her; brings me the memory of Sunset Boulevard where she also romances a much younger man in William Holden.  She told her friends that she was deeply attracted to the charm of Olivier while making this movie. At that time Swanson was living in London; Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., had suggested that she start her own studio to surmount her financial difficulties. This movie was tightly budgeted but later became every expensive since Olivier had to miss shootings because of an auto accident not related to the  movie; Swanson had to cancel few days because she had flu; and then  the studio where the film was being developed, caught fire and the film was destroyed. They had to recreate with whatever was left in a studio in United States. It became so expensive Swanson had to sell her stocks in ""United Artists"" Company.

The boat race in Cannes, France is fun part of the movie, and Swanson does a splendid job as Judy Rogers. This love story reminds me of Love Story (1964) in many ways; for one, young Laurence Olivier bears strong resemblance to Ryan O'Neal. It is a lot of fun to watch this movie.",1405382400,2,2035,4.654596100278551

8576363,3,B00C2535O4,"Laurence Olivier made his first movie in 1930 and paired with silent screen Queen Gloria Swanson in 1933, who traveled to England to make this melodrama. This is a beautiful print for an 80 year old movie. However, it really isn't very good. It looks like a Norma Desmond return to the silver screen. However, if you like or collect old movies, then this one is a find.",1372896000,4,369,4.4411764705882355
8576364,4,B00C2535O4,"This is a great little travelogue of a film, with great shots of various European locations, back before both WW2 bombing and later, globalization, had tampered with the scenery. There couldn't have been much international tourism in 1933, so these characters are indeed priveleged. Olivier seems very good here, not insufferably intense and hard to believe as he became after he returned to England in the 40's (though this is apparently an English film, with Gloria Swanson as a producer and other American actors it doesn'seem so.)",1366502400,5,534,5.149425287356322
