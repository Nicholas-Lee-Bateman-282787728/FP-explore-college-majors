5054115,5,B0074JETNO,A great little story between friends and their troubles and how their other selfs take on those troubles for them. It's a really interesting Anime and the IBRS figma looks amazing.,1370995200,,180,4.838709677419355
5054116,5,B0074JETNO,"Awsome Box set Must have If you are a big fan of the series, and don't mind spending a little money. The bluray set is awsome looks fantastic The best picture I ever seen looks amazing on both my 19"" TV and my 60"" TV. Has both english and chinese subtitles. The final disc has a good bit of extra features. The sound track is really good the only thing Im a bit dissapointed in is none of the songs is the opening theme to the anime but It's so minor it don't hurt the value. The art book is real nice got concept art and colored art as well and is stunning. Now the figma is arguably the best part simply The nicest figma I have seen Great paint job lots of accesiories. Great detail looks like they put there heart into designing it. A show peice that will stand out in any ones collection. All housed In beautiful art work outer box the bluray and sound track have a great separate box with really good art. The figma also has its own box. I highly recomend  this box set to big fans of the series and figma collectors, It has became my prize possesion.",1348963200,5,1056,4.12621359223301

8509929,5,B0074JETNO,"Amazing box set!! A little pricey but you get the series on Blu-ray as well as a nice art book, cd ost and an amazing figure!! The figure alone is probably worth most of the cost. Love this set!!",1441238400,,195,4.0256410256410255
8509930,5,B0074JETNO,Worth it! loved the show and the Music CD.,1436313600,,42,3.7777777777777777
8509931,5,B0074JETNO,"I really love this item. At first I thought the price was too much but when I saw it came with the Insane Black Rock Shooter Figma, I immediately became interested. The Blu-ray box comes with the following:
The anime on 4 Blu-ray discs
The soundtrack of on a CD
An artbook
And the Figma.
The Figma is incredible! It looks so cool when it's all put together. The attention to detail so great on it. I had no trouble putting the Figma together aside from putting the hand on the cannon handle. Apart from that, the Figma is really easy to put together. Overall, I think this is a great addition to anybody who likes Black Rock Shooter. The artwork on the box looks incredible aswell.",1435708800,11,681,4.3700787401574805
8509932,5,B0074JETNO,"Worth every penny. If you're a fan of the series, there's no better way (and no other way AFAIK) to enjoy it than on blu-ray.",1432944000,,125,4.04
8509933,5,B0074JETNO,"Got it used, so it doesn't come with the figure, but I love this anime so much and it comes in such good condition it was definitly worth it!",1407196800,,141,3.896551724137931
8509934,5,B0074JETNO,"I got mine second hand shipped from japan, the figma was unopened!!!!!!! I was able to contact the seller directly and asked if it included everything. Most seller's list an email and would love to help inform u of their available products and their quality. All was in perfect condition. Hard to believe it was second hand! BRS in bluray is worth the 300$ even used with no figma. The most beautiful anime in bluray iv ever seen. I wanted to complete my current BRS figma line when I bought this aswell I needed the BRS TV animation in bluray. For $300 that's a good deal for both! The box itself is a peoce of art. I have the art book on display and it's beautiful imeges radiate throughout my room",1405036800,,700,4.351145038167939
8509935,5,B0074JETNO,"Awesome bluray set, I will definitely treasure it for years to come.
I will definitley treasure the Insane BRS figure that came with it, but for any new buyers be careful when putting her together she has many small and fragile parts, but if you put her together right she is well worth it.
And also enjoy the artbook that comes with it.
If you you are a fan of Huke and his works this set is for you.",1404691200,2,401,4.0886075949367084
8509936,3,B0074JETNO,"This product was amazing the DVD's were in great condition and everything although since i was buying it second hand it didn't come with the figma, almost all second hand sellers will not state whether it comes with the figma or not which was upsetting because it only said Condition good. Overall this product is great if your a fan of the series and don't mind spending the money for it. Be careful when buying second hand though it may be cheaper but if you want the high quality IBRS figma your gonna have to buy it new",1396742400,,523,4.346938775510204
8509937,4,B0074JETNO,"I just wish it had the Figma with it but at least I still get to watch the whole Series of ""Black Rock Shooter"" on Blu-ray which is a plus for me and how there is a pamphlet plus DVD covers with drawings which I really like. The sad part is I can't read anything in Japanese.",1381536000,,275,3.8421052631578947
