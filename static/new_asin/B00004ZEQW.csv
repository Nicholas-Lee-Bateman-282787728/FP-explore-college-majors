1383807,5,B00004ZEQW,I saw this back in 82 when WOR out of New York use to have their 'Fright Night' movies on Saturday nights at 12:00 midnight. I've always loved this movie and still think it's scary to this day. The phone calls and sepia toned flasback scene are especially creepy. This will probably sound totally stupid to most people but I like the way this looks on the DVD release. Yes the picture quality is murky and sometimes its hard to see whats going on in a few of the scenes but that's the way these movies looked back when I use to catch them on those late night fright shows and I kinda like remebering them that way.,1091664000,20,614,4.211864406779661
1383808,4,B00004ZEQW,"I purchased Silent Night Bloody Night as part of a Horror Classics set at Best Buy, and I've got to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Not that it was a perfect movie, but one of the better ""b"" movies that I've seen. Maybe not quite as good as movies like Black Christmas, Terror Train, etc., but not bad.

 First, the bad things. The movie honestly is pretty slow moving, mediocre acting (but no worse than most other ""b"" movies), and lousy picture & sound quality. Also, the ending to the movie wasn't overly dramatic (but it was acceptable), but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie.

 But, despite these few criticisms, the movie was well directed, and the creator of the movie definitely knows what ""horror"" is. Creepy score, suspenseful in that the killer's identity is hadden until the end of the movie and you don't get to see too much of the killer too soon in the movie, and a couple of graphic scenes in the film that got my attention. Just enough gore to be effective, but not over the top.

 If you don't like slow moving, low budget movies, then you probably won't like Silent Night Bloody Night, but for most of you, I think it's definitely worth watching at least once.",1091664000,10,1202,4.465753424657534
1383809,3,B00004ZEQW,This was an interesting film that was par for the time it was made. The filming was sort of interesting especially when showing the view of the serial killer(The First person view sort of speak). The story was pretty good yet a tad over the top but as you know most horror films are a bit over the top. There is one really bloody scene at the beggining of the film that was graphic but after that don't espect too much blood. I thought this scene was done well and pretty graphic even for today's times. The music in this film is a bit hokey on certain parts but not too bad. The acting was not horrible but it wasn't great either. The part of the film that really stands out to me is the flashback scene. This really made the film spooky. The strange filming it used and the crazy story it explaned helped me like the movie alot more than I otherwise would have. The dvd version I saw came in a four horror film pack called horror classic's. I thought the sound could have been improved and certain scenes could have been transfered more clearly to the dvd but I guess I should just be glad it was even made into dvd format. Overall I think the film is worth a watch or two late at night.,1083196800,4,1189,4.173913043478261
1383810,4,B00004ZEQW,"SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT concerns an old house that used to be a mental institution. In 1935 (on Christmas eve), the ""inmates"" were released to murder their tormenting captors. In 1973, someone is killing people again, someone connected to the house and it's evil history. Why are certain victims being selected? What is their connection to that awful day in '35? John Carradine is one of those stalked by the insane killer. The true insanity begins when John Carter (Patrick O'Neal) moves into the house. A surprising amount of gore will thrill gorehundts. High marks for a genuinely bleak atmosphere, and some VERY unexpected deaths! SNBN features a mysterious, faceless, psychotic killer, two years before BLACK CHRISTMAS, and six years before HALLOWEEN. No nudity or profanity. A nice twist near the end tops off the darkness. The wonderful Mary Woronov both narrates and stars in the film. Better than fruitcake for Christmas...",1073952000,6,934,5.151315789473684
1383811,5,B00004ZEQW,"if you're looking for awesome dvd transfer and wicked special effects, go rent the matrix; but don't give a movie a poor rating just because it doesn't look like it was filmed last week. this movie features some extremely gut wrenching violence, particularly the axe scene, and the twists and turns in the plot are highly original.  this is one of those movies where a slightly convuluted plot (and it is, i admit it) actually serves to heighten the movies creepiness and atmosphere, which ""silent night, bloody night"" has plenty of.  now, there are some moments when this movie dissapoints, namely the narrative which makes up the first ten minutes.  however, the axe scenes, the part where the mute has his hands cut off so he can't ""call for help"",  and the suggestion of a town founded by escaped lunatics more than makes up for these problems.  acting wise, i've seen far, far worse, and the soundtrack is very atmospheric.  rent this movie, but be warned- this does not look like a dvd.  this, as already stated, should have no effect upon ones view of the movie itself, and if it does? well, go rent titanic instead.",1055116800,7,1123,4.67005076142132
1383812,3,B00004ZEQW,"This is one I remeber watching on our old B&W when I was a kid.  To see it on DVD uncut was great, except for the transfer which at times is hard to watch. This is not your run-of-the-mill slasher flick but a more complex shocker that keeps you guessing and please watch this with someone, as you will be looking over your shoulder after it ends.  This film is worth the seven bucks, I would definitly buy a better version from Anchor Bay if they ever made a copy.  Hint, Hint.",997315200,2,477,4.163043478260869
1383813,1,B00004ZEQW,"This movie is very very very bad.  I usually dig B movies that have some redeeming qualities but this one was totally unwatchable.  The print used for this transfer is equally lousy.  Usually diamond releases aren't the best but for a bargain price they usually look pretty, but not this one.  I'm glad they didn't put too much effort into this release or they'd be wasting their time.  Sometimes to get these inexpensive prices thought they have to find movies that have become public domain.  Okay, well, I usually give a synopsis so I'll do that, but not a long one. (Hey, it's not like this was a classic anyway.)  This guy sees some other guy dressed as Santa doing perverted things with his mommy when he's a kid.  When he grows up they send him to a nut house.  He escapes and dresses up like Santa and goes around killing just about everyone you're introduced to in this movie.  The novelty of a murdeous Santa Claus wears off in approximately 1.5 minutes.  If you're a DVD collector just buying every extremely cheap DVD is the only reason I can think of to buy this movie.  It's very boring and it gets dull too quick.",974764800,7,1128,4.4487804878048784

The recent Film Chest edition is definitely the way to go for best audio/video, though it's still tough at times to make out all the dialogue. Good images/facial imagery save this one from 2 star infamy, but it's a close call. Enjoy!",1451779200,,409,4.857142857142857
1383815,5,B00004ZEQW,This is a movie worth upgrading to.  I was intrigued by this movie after watching the murky public domain version so I went looking for the best version possible.  Film Chest has the best available print and at a reasonable price.  The Code Red version is good and appears to use the same source but it must be out of print as it is not easy to find. There are occasionally some green lines and dirt but the picture is sharp and bright enough to see a lot of detail missing on the earlier dark prints.  I do not mind damage as long as the picture is not fuzzy and this is not.  I like the mood of this movie.  It has that early 1970s feel.,1451779200,,639,4.031746031746032

1383817,2,B00004ZEQW,"2 Decembers ago, I was bored watching Silent Night, Bloody Night. The movie's trailer, night scenery, the voyeurism, music, phone calls, and Wilfred Butler's low, muffled voice were creepy. Otherwise, Silent Night, Bloody Night was very slow and boring. If memory serves me right, I started dosing off at my keyboard just watching it.",1451260800,,334,5.203703703703703
1383818,4,B00004ZEQW,"The cinematography by Adam Giffard is outstanding.  Many of the shots are carefully composed for maximum impact.  I loved the look of this film.  The story, however, was another matter entirely.  It takes forever for the point to be revealed.  In between this lack of information, there are weird people acting weird and not making any sense (until the plot is exposed quite late in the movie).  Like most slasher flicks, the usual format is present.......entice people to a house with a grim history then kill them with great dispatch.  But.  These characters come and go before they have a chance to register on any level.  Poor John Carradine is sorely underused, reduced to ringing a bell rather than speaking.  The continuity leaves much to be desired.  And while there is a high sense of creepiness infesting most of the film, the attitude conveyed by the actors is one of great disinterest rather than a heightened sense of urgency.  A loony is on the loose and people are disappearing, shouldnt they be worried!?!?

Even so, lackluster story aside, this long lost horror gem hits enough notes that I quite enjoyed watching the struggle and ultimate downfall of a minor masterpiece being foiled by lousy exposition and poor direction (Theodore Gershuny).  Regardless, its a keeper!",1450224000,,1288,4.957943925233645

1383821,3,B00004ZEQW,"I found the Film Chest restored version to be a disappointment. The picture is much clearer than my other versions of the film, but the aspect ratio was blown up cutting taking some of the picture off the top and bottom to make it wider to be widescreen. This gives the impression of hitting your zoom to make a widescreen of a film originally shot in full screen. I know this makes some people happy and is the modern thing to do, but I like to see all of the intended footage. The picture would probably be even clearer than it is had this not been done.

The Paranormal Activity movies and the hand held camera films do not count. This is back in the day when the film stock was cheap (most times using 16mm film) and it gives the picture a rather ""realistic"" feel to what is happening on screen (like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre). There have been many public domain versions of this film out and this (I have yet to see the Code Red DVD) is by far the best I have ever seen it. Like one reviewer stated, the picture is brighter and you are able to see things that were hidden from the dark image of earlier releases. The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and the colors are not the brightest, but they will do for the low quality film used back in these low budget horror films. I am hoping more obscure horror films get rescued from the public domain hell. Because this title is not as bad as you would think. Starring Patrick O'Neal and cult fav Mary Woronov. Directed by Theodore Gershuny (too bad more people did not like his films back in the day because of that he only made three theatrical films).

Well, this edition DOES improve upon all other releases, and may be the best we'll get for this independent and low-budget title.  What you get is a non-anamorphic 16X9 picture, which loses a bit on the top and the bottom but does not ruin the image in any significant way.

Many of the dark scenes - and there are a lot of them - are improved, as is the sound.  Unfortunately, there are quite a few instances of green horizontal scratches.  There are no liner notes or extras of any kind, which is a shame.

If you are a fan of this movie, then this edition will be a welcome part of your collection, but is a bit less than a ""restored"" version.",1387929600,,843,4.371794871794871

First of all this is an excellent movie. Its about time its been given a good release. I want to comment on the quality of the DVD. I have several copies if the film on DVD from different distributors. The FILM CHEST Version is the ONLY one to get. Its not 100% perfect but as close as you can get due to the films history. The movie is public domain and has been released under several different names. This is Silent Night Bloody Night but the title in the opening credits its credited as Death House. Let me assure you it is the correct film. It must have been the best print they could find to work with. As far as I can tell its not edited. Sound and Color are very good, even the dark scenes.

1383839,4,B00004ZEQW,"SILENT NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT is one of those films that I had heard about for a long, long time and had even seen in video stores...but for some reason, I never picked it up.  Im not sure why because it has a big cult following, which means its right up my alley.  The fine folks at Film Chest Media sent me a copy to review, so I eagerly threw it into my player.  While not perfect, its a great horror film that any genre enthusiast will no doubt enjoy.

Before you sit down to watch this film, you have to remind yourself the era in which it was made.  Back in 1973, Hammer horror was on the decline and many American studios were trying to skirt past the dark, Gothic undertones that had made the style so popular.  As a result, these studios looked to push the envelope in areas previously made famous by hammer.  You might say this is ultimately what led to the slasher-flick craze.

Which is basically what SILENT NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT is...a stylized slasher-flick.  But keep in mind:  this was one of the first.  Up to this point, the formula for horror was a mish-mash of nuclear-test scares and overdone legendary monster tropes.  This film sorta broke the mold for that and introduced an almost Hitchcock-like style to the modern horror film.

The cinematography in the film is ok, but pretty basic.  The same can be said for the acting.  But again, were talking about the early 70s here, so a bit of forgiveness should be allowed.  I am impressed by the gore, however.  When the killer enters the bedroom and starts wailing on two people with an axe, the blood goes flying...and it looks great.  Even their death throes are believable.

SILENT NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT is an obscure title, but I suggest checking it out if you're looking for some nostalgic horror.  It won't be for everyone, but if you can look past the grainy picture and the static-filled sound, you're in for a treat.  This remastered Film Chest Media version will be available next week, so make a note.",1386201600,2,1977,4.512676056338028
1383840,1,B00004ZEQW,"This starts off lame, grey, colourless (and it was in colour), and cold. It definitely has some familiar faces seen often with most classic 1970's horror.

It's an axe wielding, shovel using, slasher flick that has creepy undertones of religious extremism meets dangerous, violent person's mind and from there it only gets stranger and not in a good way. It stars John Carradine. It's an obvious low budget film. It's dark, poorly lighted, and based upon the storyline of ""Mary Ann"" and her progeny named ""Jeffery"".

1383848,3,B00004ZEQW,"This movie does not get the credit it deserves for being more of a pioneer in the genre than ""Black Christmas"" or ""Halloween"". It's not perfect, but it's a moody, depressing, atmospheric film that was filmed in 1972 when cinema sleaze seemed to be at its peak with great trash like ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Last House on the Left"" hitting midnight theaters and drive-ins.

The story revolves around the sale of a gothic old house by the original owner's mysterious grandson. It's a house of secrets that the citizens of an old New England town would like to see destroyed forever. But what secrets of their own are these people hiding and who would like to see them die?

I only knew Mary Woronov as the bitchy prison matron who sprayed down ""Charlie's Angels"" for lice and bugs in 1976, and her performance here as the so-called ""final girl"" isn't as fun or campy. She also seems much younger and softer here.

Still, a lengthy, creepy flashback sequence that looks like old pre-WWII European stock footage (featuring Candy Darling and other Warhol ""superstars""), an intriguing storyline, and some shocking gore for its time outweigh a few uninspired performances and some slow spots in the script.

The print looks ragged and worn, but the DVD market is oversaturated with public domain releases of this film and a restored version is highly unlikely.

If you enjoy early '70s twisted thrillers such as ""Blood and Lace"", ""Private Parts"" or ""Don't Look in the Basement"" this one will be right up your alley.",1319328000,2,1505,4.795366795366795

1383852,4,B00004ZEQW,"SILENT NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT is one of the earliest of the ""slasher"" flicks. It inspired such movies as BLACK CHRISTMAS and to a lesser extent, SCREAM. There are a lot of things in this movie that have become staples of slasher films, such as the maniac calling the victims on the phone, and keeping the viewers guessing as to the identity of the killer.

The plot for this movie is a good, albeit simple one. The killer calls the eventual victims and lures them to a house where they meet their eventual demise. However, there are a lot of sub plots (rivaling the nighttime soaps Dallas and Dynasty!) that I found a little difficult to keep up with. Like EVIL DEAD, almost the entire movie takes place in a single night (with the exception of flashbacks, obviously). But unlike EVIL DEAD, there isn't really enough action to sustain it.

The cast is pretty well stocked, with early scream queen Mary Woronov, Patrick O'Neal and John Carradine (who was pretty much wasted in his role). The acting is sufficient to above average, but don't look for anything outstanding here. And although the writing suffers a little in my opinion, there is a lot of well-written dialogue in this film.

The base plot is as follows: Wilfred Butler dies, and leaves his house, grounds and all the belongings (which was used as an insane asylum for a few years) to his only surviving relative (isn't it always that way?), Jeff Butler. The only condition is that he has to keep the house in the same state that it was when he owned it. Jeff adheres to his grandfather's wishes for twenty years, but finally decides to sell it. PLOT POINT: The news travels to a local insane asylum, where we see an escape, but we don't know who it is that escapes. I don't think the writers did, either.

Shortly afterwards, Jeff's lawyer and his mistress arrive to sell the house, and decide to stay in the house overnight. Big mistake. They're the first victims in this new round of killings. Their murders are both violent and bloody. The rest of the film shows the killer luring the victims to the house over the phone. The killer goes by the name Mary Ann, who happens to be Jeff's mother, who as far as he knows died in childbirth. And his father turns out to be none other than his grandfather! The ending itself could have been written a lot better, but the person who turns out to be the killer is a bit of a surprise. But alas, that too turned into a letdown.

The biggest problem with this film is the lighting, or lack thereof. Almost the entire movie is filmed at night, and there seems to be little, if any lighting. There's a scene in the local newspaper office (run by Carradine) where the entire shot seems to be lighted by the single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling! Even the flashlights aren't powerful on this movie (the scene from BLAIR WITCH PROJECT with Heather holding the flashlight to her face is reminiscent of this).

Overall, it's watchable. But the poor lighting, confusing sub-plots and the bad ending pulls it down from a 5 to a 4.",1285632000,2,3027,4.534798534798535

The original reviews list the running time as 87 minutes but this cannot be accurate. At 82 minutes, the original Paragon video was often too dark to clearly see what was going on, while each of the DVDs through 2012 feature picture quality superior to the video. I can't stand hearing people complain about this movie's 'poor film stock,' as this was a low-budget production and such viewers suffered through one of its numerous bad prints. The video was missing 1 or 2 scenes and had 1 or 2 others shortened. There also seems to be no DVD releases that appear to be intact...except this one from Film Chest that runs 85 minutes. All the credits are intact and clearly legible and, having seen this film several times since 1977, it's a relief that so many tiny details can now be seen. While the first murder appears to be cut, it is simply a bad case of editing for all the versions feature the same identical footage.

1383858,5,B00004ZEQW,"Parts of New York have tried to be very Greek.  A groupie of Andy Warhol, a 60s pop artist based in New York and a patron of the rock star, Lou Reed, was  a transvestite who called himself Ondine.  (Ondine comes from the name of the sprite of fresh water streams in German mythology).

  In ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" with Mary Waranov (another Warhol groupie), Ondine gouges the eyes out of a doctor in 1935 for ""abusing"" psychiatric patients, presumably homosexuals, since they became persecuted in  around 1935.  It is very ""Odyssey""-like.  In the ""Oddyssey"", Odysseus gouges the eye out of cyclops with a wood spike.

  It is worth noting that there is nothing pro-transvestite about Giraudoux's ""Ondine"" play.  Perhaps ""Silent Night Bloody Night"" is anti-French as well. That would explain the similarity of this movie with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"".",1241222400,,860,5.057142857142857

1383861,4,B00004ZEQW,"I got this movie in a collection of fifty horror films, most of which were goddawful funny (anyone remember ""Spider Island"" or ""Jesse James Meets Frankenstien's Daughter""?) so when I got around to watching ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" I was expecting another low-budget camp fest.  I could tell I was getting something different from the first few minutes.

Granted, the film's condition has deteriorated a bit.  The film appears grainy at times, and damaged at the worst.  Don't let that cloud your vision though!  The movie itself isn't all that bad.  In fact, it reminds me a lot of the original ""Amnityville Horror.""

The film involves a house that has a bit of a dark history.  The patrician of the family, Wilfred (?) Butler (who I kept wanting to call William Butler... Yeats) is introduced, and burned to death all in the same instant.  His presense, however, is felt through the rest of the movie.  He's got soem dark secrets.

Part suspense, part slasher, part creepy incest (is there any other kind?) this movie moves pretty quick and won't bore you (unlike ""Oasis of the Zombies"" which seemed too promising to suck).  I thought it was cool how, when the film goes into a bit of backstory, the film makers used older cameras.  The film quality goes from 70s slasher to ""Nosfuratu"" in about two seconds flat.  I thought it worked.  Definatley made the faces look harsher and more demented.

Despite having to retract my original stance that the movie was going to be a laugh, I still kept searching for holes in the plot... couldn't really find many.  Though the people in the film seem to be inhumanly on-the-ball about everything (including minor details that the film barley mentions) I still couldn't find many inconsistencies in the story.  At one point, the grandson of Butler steals his lawyer's car for seemingly no reason, but this is explained a couple minutes later.

A few things I did think were dumb:

  - The sherrif goes out to the Butler house at night... wearing sunglasses.  The moral? Don't mess around with a guy in shades.
  - Some of the dialogue is poor.
  - A good deal of the acting is too, but relax, because the worst offender (the lawyer's love interest AKA Slow Disrobe.) is taken care of pretty quick.",1203811200,,2242,4.711340206185567

1383863,4,B00004ZEQW,"""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" is a low-budget, poorly edited but compulsively watchable 70s horror flick concerning the escape of a maniac from a mental institution, with an ax (figuratively and literally) to grind with the citizens of a small community that has more dirty little secrets than Peyton Place. An abandoned mansion sits, menacingly in the dark of night, luring some of the town's most prominent members via whispering, creepy phone calls. But who is it? And why? The sheriff's daughter, Diane (Mary Woronov) meets the grandson of the home's original owner, Jeffrey Butler (James Patterson), and the two set out to investigate what is going on. It turns out that both of them are closer to the mystery than they would care to be - with many frightening turns and revelations that I wouldn't think of giving away. One thing about the film that is irritating (besides the choppy editing), is that the top-billed performer, Patrick O'Neal, has a brief bit early on as a real estate agent who, along with his attractive girlfriend (Astrid Hereen) is brutally butchered in the Victorian style bedroom of the ancestral home. Why wouldn't Patterson and Woronov be first in the credits, since their roles are far more prominent? John Carradine gives a very effective performance as the town mute who also has a past entangled with Jeffrey's grandfather, Wilfred Butler.

The shoestring budget can be frustrating at times, particularly during the flashback sequences, and the late night darkness makes viewing more difficult, but it also adds to the atmospheric quality of the production.

7928459,4,B00004ZEQW,"I had never seen this film before, but I was ""collecting"" some Christmas horror films, and this one seemed to fit the bill. (Many of these films have similar titles, or even identical titles!). Anyway, this Film Chest Restored Version is the only version I have seen, and it is perfectly acceptable in video and audio quality. I viewed on a large 72 Inch HD screen, and it held its own -- no pixelation, etc. This is an old film (1972) and its video quality, of course, will not be the same as a recent film.

The cinematography is impressively creepy. Seems almost like an ""art"" film. But the story line is a bit convoluted, and there may be snippets of scenes missing. Some images are only about 2 seconds long, and I sometimes rewound the film to verify that what I thought I saw was what I saw. Maybe, though, this is just the way the director or editor wanted it.

In general, the viewer ""gets"" what was intended: incest, old vacant house left to grandson, owner had turned it into a psych hospital for his daughter's care, but then it got out of hand, and it seems that it became a warehouse for psychiatric ""patients"". This aspect is not really developed -- just shown in sepia tones, and a reading from ""the diary"". Yes, a bit confusing.

SPOILER: Apparently, the townsfolk in charge of the town were former escaped psychiatric patients. This is not really developed -- it is simply told to us by the grandson. So, there is some creepy background stuff going on in the film, but it is not well-developed. Just sort of revealed all of a sudden. I won't go into any more revelations here. But, I wish the story had been more fleshed out, and didn't wander around so much. It is a bit slow at times due to its focus on various things that then go nowhere. But, it does make the viewer wonder: what the hell is going on?

 The acting was creepy, and matched the creepiness of the entire film. Not really gory at all -- implied gore, mostly. This barely qualifies as a slasher-type film. More a psycho/mystery/murder/ revenge film with competent actors and photography.",1514246400,,2072,4.5
