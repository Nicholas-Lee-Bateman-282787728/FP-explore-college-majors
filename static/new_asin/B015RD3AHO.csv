Any fan of music knows when you actually see the words it just is that far more impressive with Roger Waters being the creator of most songs and lyrics. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST OWN BLUE RAY DVD SHOW.  MOSTLY CONCERT MATERIAL BUT SOME AWESOME SIDE CUTS AS WELL.  Just trust me and buy this right now folks you'll be so very happy you did. I pre-ordered 3 copies 1 for each of my theater rooms around the country.  I was raised in a huge musical family so much so music is not just what I do it is who I am.  IT'S THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH! I'LL BE WATCHING THIS WEEKLY FOREVER!",1445299200,5,674,4.186046511627907
7446465,5,B015RD3AHO,"I saw Roger Waters The Wall movie last night in Wilmington, Delaware at Christiana Mall Cinemark as a special fathom event. I have always been a fan of The Wall so I could be biased in my review. The most striking to me was the way they used digital technology to improve the stage production of the concert. The Wall concerts are known for being a magnificent rock theater productions with giant sets and light shows.

Even though I have not had the chance to see Pink Floyd The Wall concert back in the day (where is the blu-ray for that, by the way?), I have read so much about them I feel like I know what they are like. I had a chance to see one or two Roger Waters The Wall shows in the last 10 years, but I thought it would not be the same experience as seeing the entire Pink Floyd (the original Wall concerts) so I passed.

I had never thought Roger Waters could put out such a magnificent show without the other members. This is a well-made concert movie with all the magnificence of the show captured beautifully. If you like The Wall (as an album and as a movie), you will definitely get a kick out of this.

The movie begins with a poignant introduction from Liam Neeson who talks about the effect the Wall had in his personal life when he first moved to London in 1980. I thought his introduction was great and very appropriate. Roger Waters stays true to the original concept of The Wall, and yet he manages to improve upon it using technology. There are no Pink Floyd members but all the musicians in the show do a terrific job. The clips from the original The Wall movie are shown on the wall/screen but they are artistically infused with new visuals (erotic images of women to the song ""Young Lust""); and some additions (images from recent wars, and the pictures of the people who lost their lives either as result of wars, armed conflicts or state terror). I would describe the movie as the re-visualization and the modernization of The Wall concept movie and concerts. There is also a subplot where Roger Waters opens up about the grief he feels over the death of his father (which The Wall was inspired from), pays visits to cemeteries to pay his respects  and visits Italy where the memorial is. I found those scenes to be very emotional and Roger Waters to be very sincere and vulnerable like a true artist should be.

At the end of the movie, there is a conversation with Nick Mason and Roger Waters as they answer questions from fans submitted through the Internet. I especially enjoyed that session which was only 15 minutes. I am hoping maybe this Blu-ray edition has more of that session and other extra features.

Overall, I think The Wall is an enduring work of art, as a rock album, rock theater production and a movie. The concepts explored in The Wall are probably more relevant today than they were when the album first came out.

7446466,5,B015RD3AHO,"Absolutely staggering film. The concept of the Wall can be assimilated to all of us, erecting a brick wall to protect ourselves from our emotions of fear, anger, hate, despair, depression. Roger Waters shows brilliantly his struggle to overcome or conquer the guilt he feels for loosing his father during the Second World War, portrayed through a magical and fantastic concert which depicts and shares many of the lives that were lost during armed conflict. I had goosebumps, the occasional teary eye and the waterworks when Comfortably Numb was played. Simply marvelous.",1445126400,5,571,5.217391304347826

7446469,5,B015RD3AHO,"A definate purchase.  I saw the film earlier this week and as a lifelong Floyd fan I was astonished.  I am not a fan of the Berlin Wall performance in 1990 (but of course own it) and was somewhat skeptical before going to see this presentation.  I loved all of it.  While it is hard to top the original music and subsequent movie, the interpretation and performance certainly present a version that is different yet just as amazing.  If you saw this tour in America you only saw part of what is in this film.  Now how about a blu-ray of the Alan Parker film of The Wall, and how about a 5.1 release of the original double disc studio recording.  Take my money please.",1443657600,44,667,4.288
7446470,5,B015RD3AHO,"I also attended the special premiere screening of Roger Waters: The Wall last night in
College Point, Queens, N.Y., after having hoped for some free tix to the NYC Ziegfield premiere the previous night, but
since I apparently didn't snag any tickets to that, I attended the Tue. evening one-nighter in
Queens. The film is really stupendous, moving, draining, emotionally and otherwise,
I definitely was glad, as a Floyd and Roger fan going back to around 1977-78 or so,
I went out of my way to see The Wall film in a theater on a good-size screen, and not
at some tiny local theater or indie that's not set up for showing such a momentous
spectacle. This film begs to be seen on the largest screen you can find, with the
best sound system available.  This is the type of movie that Dolby Atmos was
conceived for, I would submit. IMAX would have been even better, but good luck, I guess.

My Cliff's Notes (well this grew longer than I intended, but so be it!)
on the film itself, without spoiling it too much, is
part concert film of an entire Wall performance, part-documentary following Roger
on recent auto trips around Europe, France and Italy, finally visiting both his grandfather's grave
and war memorial from WW I, standing alongside his children, and ultimately making his first visit to the Monte
Cassino War Memorial, Gardens and War Cemetery where his own father, Eric
Fletcher Waters, is memorialized. Without much editorializing by Waters, the film
mainly lets the concert, music, and even some of Roger's key friends tell stories
and add to the narrative, speak, and these sequences are artfully cut to fit in with,
and advance, the concert film narrative.  In a weird sense, this film might have ended up
more like a version of the original conception for The Wall theatrical film before it was drastically
altered and taken over by director Alan Parker (with screenplay by Waters)
for the 1982 film Pink Floyd: The Wall (which featured no actual concert footage
from the Wall tours, as originally intended, and no commentary by the band
as ""cast members,"" either), although of course, in this case,
not starring the entire original band, for the most obvious reasons,
although the screening did feature a separate Q/A segment, The Simple
Facts (shouldn't that have been The Basic Facts, a la the original lyrics
to Comfortably Numb? but no worries), with Roger and Nick Mason, sitting down together, unscripted, answering a stack
of fans questions sent in ahead of time over the WWW, which was great fun, if all too brief.

Some Floyd and Roger fans have at times complained of/wearied of,
Roger's seeming obsession with using his father's death
at Anzio in 1944 in both The Wall and The Final Cut as a major running theme,
with The Final Cut in particular being dedicated to his father, explicitly,
but I think, after seeing this film and the footage of Roger confronting the reality,
on-site, of the double tragedies of the loss of both his grandfather and father in
the two wars, and the fact that The Wall has been expanded to include more global
and political concerns, losses and tragedies including all sorts of other wars
and conflicts, that their mindset will be forever changed.

I don't see how you can sit through this powerful film and not be moved by it.  Some of the footage
with Roger reading the letter sent to his mother by Eric Waters' Commanding Officer
from the Royal Fusiliers, declaring his father definitively killed in action at the Battle of Anzio
in 1944, but whose body was never found, and a friend of his (I wish the film had done a better job of
identifying these important figures!! It doesn't, other reviews have done so, and perhaps this
was on purpose, but it's a bit irritating upon first viewing, I would imagine particularly for the
totally uninitiated), who tells of his family's narrow escape from Budapest
while the Hungarian SS were closing in around 1943 or so, and then the madness of
them returning three years later to find the same dinner settings still
on their totally miraculously unscathed home dinner table, food still on the plates etc.,
may truly stay with you forever.

In this sense, Roger Waters: The Wall transcends
merely being a de rigueur concert film or rockumentary, and evolves over the 2 plus hour running
time into something truly moving, devastating at times, and unique.  What used to be
a somewhat depressing, utterly bombastic, brilliant but often draining album, film (the 1982
film being particularly brilliant, groundbreaking, yet also rather pummeling and deadening),
and show, is now an updated, revamped, more relevant to the 21st Century (yet faithful
to the original album and live shows), live experience with a
righteous anger and purpose behind it, reaching far beyond just the
story of Pink and his descent into madness and the basic Wall story, familiar
to most of us by now.

We no longer need to hear When The Tigers Broke
Free, the two-part narrative song added to the 1982 film detailing the story of Pink's (Roger's)
father's demise in WWII and its effect on the protagonist's development,
especially after seeing Roger reading that letter, and
playing ""Outside The Wall"" on trumpet at the Monte Cassino Memorial.
We see enough for 10 lifetimes, to cement this awful reality and the cost
of war and hammer it home to us. It is powerful and difficult to watch, or at least,
I found it thus. Between the two streams of the film,
I can't imagine that anybody with a heart and a brain will exit the theater
unscathed, or unmoved.

I also eagerly await the upcoming DVD or Blu-ray of The Wall to watch
it over and over, and hoping for some great extras as well. In the meantime,
the attendance at last night's screening was extraordinarily poor, perhaps only
80-100 people there at best, by my reckoning.  My Yelp rundown of last night's
screening will have to suffice here in the meantime, as below.  No faulting
the film itself, which was no disappointment whatsoever.  The poor attendance
and/or promotion was, however. I spotted a few fans leaving afterwards
sporting Roger or PF tshirts, as I was, but precious few.  The sparse attendance
was greatly troubling to me on various levels.

The fact that there were, inexplicably,
no screenings scheduled in Nassau County, L.I., long a major seat of Pink Floyd
fandom, as well as Suffolk (which had a few locations for the film premiere), made
little sense to me, especially given that The Nassau Coliseum was the site of
both several of the key 1980 Wall Tour shows, and also some of the more recent
Roger Waters The Wall Tour shows. You would have thought Nassau LI would
have been designated for at least one theater for this film, then, but apparently
not, unless I missed something.  In any case, read on for my experience
Tuesday evening:

(the text of my Yelp Roger Waters: The Wall theater/screening review, Sep. 29, 2015, 8-11 p.m.--
this review is entirely by me and not for profit whatsoever, I hope it's ok to post here)
The theater was College Point Queens Multiplex, off the Whitestone Expressway, Queens NY.

Never been to this theater before, I never come over here, mainly, for any reason,
but I did tonight especially for the one-night-only screening of Roger Waters: The Wall film
event from 8-11 p.m.  Film great, extraordinarily moving, theater fine, parking fine, great auditorium and seating, (no hot beverages for sale at all but that's usually the case
at most multiplexes, ok) trouble is, folks, we only had a turnout of perhaps 100 people
at best, for a special Roger Waters film event, for an auditorium that seats
capacity around 380-400 people.

I loved the film and glad I came here for it, it was the only semi-convenient screening for me driving-wise, since bafflingly, no screenings scheduled for Nassau County as far as I could tell, but folks, whoever was doing the promotion locally for this event (I don't mean
the theater, I mean any kind of regional event promo team), I think, need
to be like, fired.  This kind of meager turnout is dispiriting and disappointing.
It's nice to have your pick of seats, but that's not the point, obviously.

So few people here for Roger tonight, I felt almost like I was behind the Wall,
all alone, isolated, nearly.  Perfect isolation, here behind these empty rows of
seats.....Wacky. I cannot imagine The Wall, Pink Floyd, and/or Roger
aren't as popular as ever, especially judging from the success of both the
Wall tours the past several years, so that doesn't seem to explain tonight's
lackluster attendance.

Work on this, guys!!  I loved the whole concept of this special event
and it was great to see The Wall on the big screen, the way it really should
be seen, in lieu of seeing the actual live show, but it would have been even better to nearly get a sold-out auditorium, some promo goodies, posters, a special guest, local radio
push, and appearance, ANYTHING to make it a real special event.
The weather got awful later tonight, but so what?  I know this ain't 1980 but
for Pete's sake.  I guess it's time for me to apply for future Waters event
promotion, given I have college radio and marketing education, I'll do chicken right,
goshdarnit!!  I'll fill that bloody theater with bodies!. This proves, I think, that the Internet alone can only do so much in that regard.",1443571200,12,9307,4.781931464174455

The visionary and musicality of the production is so stunning that it leaves you breathless. The revised storyline with the documentary that leads Mr. Waters to visit his grandfather's and then his father's final resting place was told with true conviction in the music as well as the personal journey that was taken throughout the movie.
The forethought in dreaming of this production and then seeing it come to fruition is no less a feat that ranks as a highlight in Mr. Waters career.
I am such a huge Pink Floyd fan that I can be somewhat bias, however after saying that, if you have an ear for true professional music that reflects such hard work, no matter what music genre you like, than please do yourself a favor and get this one.
You won't be disappointed ! Thank you Pink Floyd for changing my life, and thank you Mr. Waters for a truly remarkable production !",1443484800,30,1094,4.50251256281407

7446476,5,B015RD3AHO,"Great concert in person... and very good on screen.  I didn't expect the ""documentary"" part of it to be mixed in with the concert, but it was very well done.  It appears that Mr. Waters is trying to atone for some of his past, and looking for some closure in regards to his dad/grandpa.  I did not know his grandpa was also killed in WWI (if I was following correctly).  I was never a fan of his bleeding heart/politics, but this seems to make me think he's coming around a bit.
As far as the video, and sound, they were fantastic.  Recorded/mixed in Dolby Atmos. sounded and looked great.

7446486,5,B015RD3AHO,"This is a great representation of the live show filled in with footage of Roger Waters mourning lives lost in war. He lost his father as an infant. I see reviewers commenting that he should ""get over it"" because ""never even knew him"". I lost my father when I was an infant (not to war, but to a tragic accident) and forty years later I cry occasionally when I think of how things would have been different if it wasn't for his death. That loss will still be there when I'm 70, and it'll be there if I live to 90.

I may not agree 100% with all of Mr. Waters' political stances, but I hate war and I can empathize and relate to his experience. I can see Mr. Waters' pain is genuine, and all of The Wall (from the album to the original concert tour to this video) is an expression of it.

7446530,4,B015RD3AHO,"Know at the outset that you are getting part concert film, part therapeutic documentary and they are commingled....

The concert itself is simply epic. I've seen this Wall show twice, and the video simply nails it. The album is perfectly performed, flawlessly rendered, against a backdrop of visuals and technology beyond Roger's wildest dreams when he conceived the album. Even a casual Floyd fan should not miss this show- it's simply an apex-type performance.

That said, it is peppered with vignettes of Roger reliving painful moments in his upbringing- pain driven by war, loss and alienation- with commentary on our sad societal state. It's dark, like only Roger can be.  I feel your pain my friend, and respect your desire to change the darkest of humanity.... but I'm not sure I wanted it buried inbetween the tracks.  While it does explain the undercurrent that spawned the Wall, it takes away from what is an otherwise amazing show. Had it been a bonus feature with the concert, 5 stars. Buried inside- 4 stars.

Check your AVR manual to see if you're actually getting it. TV's up to 2016 did not typically transfer the good formats through the ARC channel.

As for the movie, it's amazing to see this concert, which is interspersed with personal story telling. About 70-80% music, and the music is a LOT of fun. The footage is from several venues. I would love to see the actual show in person. I did see the ""Us and Them"" tour, and it was excellent, but I truly hope I can see the wall come down in person.

7446563,5,B015RD3AHO,"By now, many reviews have been written on this product. A number of reviewers who have criticized it (albeit in a very minor way) for not being a ""complete"" concert, or for not having the option of viewing/listening to the live show straight through (i.e., without any of the vignettes of Roger on the road), are, (with all due respect), missing the point. This is NOT just another concert. It is much more than a band getting up on stage and playing a set or two of music. This is musical theater in its grandest form. The portions of the show filmed outside of the stadium are an integral part of the production. Importantly, they do not take up very much time, but they do contribute significantly to the whole. If this were a recording of four guys playing on a small stage in a club, and the camera continually drifted away from the players to show trippy visuals or landscapes (like too many concert videos have done), I'd say thumbs down all the way, but that is NOT what this is. This production was MAMMOTH in size and scope; simply filming the band singing and playing the songs the whole time would have miserably failed to capture its essence. One reviewer who had attended the show in the tenth row and again in the middle of the stadium, (I should have been so lucky to have attended it just once, anywhere in the venue!), wrote that the film did not succeed in replicating the experience of the show and all that it had to offer, because it kept moving from the stage, to the POV of Roger looking out at the crowd, to a vignette on the road, etc., instead of staying in the middle of the stadium focused on the stage. (S/he opined that the middle of the venue was a better spot to be than up close.) Not having seen the show, I won't argue the point. The film did, in my opinion, give the viewer/listener a means of experiencing the production about as well as any film possibly could have done!

One might criticize this film (and the live show) as pretentious, over-the-top, depressing, or any number of other things, but it is undeniably a HUGE artistic production and accomplishment. If you enjoy(ed) the album (i.e., Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'), then I highly recommend this film. You not only get to hear the music performed nearly flawlessly by its principal creator and a hand-picked bunch of cracking musicians, but you get to view a spectacle of truly epic proportions to boot. This necessarily means that you don't get to watch the musicians the whole time (like you would on most great concert video recordings... remember that this is NOT just a concert). In my opinion, this is NOT a flaw of the film, but rather an asset. While watching players play is usually the ""raison de etre"", this is not the case here... the players become more and more hidden by the wall being built as the show progresses, and this is a major part of the production. No stage production of this magnitude exists anywhere else, and it literally has to be seen to be believed! In this case (and perhaps only in this case), the ""show"" eclipses the players (intentionally and very successfully). The size and scale of the show is absolutely enormous, and for this reason, among others, the production (including the shots on the road and elsewhere) is worthy of a film (hence the film).

Last but not least, the quality of everything is superb... the video production, the editing, the sound, the mixing, the musicianship, the stage production... everything. The content is a little dark, (to say the least, hence the R rating), but if you are not put off by it (most fans of The Wall clearly are not), then it's well worth the ride.",1499385600,3,3633,4.545038167938931

I mean, some of it was sort of touching, but like another reviewer said, those parts were made for Waters, not us.

On a technical level, everything looks and sounds good. I haven't delved into the bonus stuff yet, but for $12 I got to see a pretty great looking concert with neat visuals and solid musicianship. I'd recommend it to any Floyd fan who missed the tour. One complaint I did have about the show: I wish they did something more with 'The Trial'.

The one great thing about this movie, it made me aware this entire album and all of its songs were nothing more than the commercial end product of one rich Old guy with Mommy and Daddy issues who to this day still cannot get over things that happened to him when he was 8 years old. The one thing everyone overlooks about British rock and roll is the fact that every last British rock group from the 60's - 70's - 80's all sell the grand illusion that they are making a great statement and being anti establishment.... when every one of them immediately sold out, got rich and moved to a giant country estate where they do exactly the same thing their ancestors did 100 years before them. More of the sex, drugs, rock and roll, will bring something better to this world lie. Waters is no longer in Pink Floyd for pretty much the same reason he gives in this performance.... the  guy cannot get over stuff from his child hood.

As for the concert, fasten your seatbelts it's gonna be an awesome ride! Roger does a phenomenal job of recreating the Rock Opera without David Gilmour. He's amazing live and the new arrangements make the songs richer, fuller and more impressive. And I've never seen a stage as humongous as this one. It's the longest one I've ever seen. The background animations and the live action puppets and floating props are unbelievable. It is intercut with vignettes of his search for his father which I feel is what drove him to write most of The Wall in the first place. Get this and his DVD In the Flesh for an evening of pure Waters!",1487980800,3,807,4.452702702702703

I have recommended it to all of my friends that are Pink Floyd fans. It's the Wall as you know it, but Roger Waters is completely let loose with his vision of the album as he intended. Therefore, it visually presents Waters' ideas and themes that may not have been as clear on the original album (with the original band). Check it out!",1486857600,,475,4.471264367816092

7446620,5,B015RD3AHO,I love this DVD . I listened to the sound track repetitiously in high school and continue to revere his music today . The DVD plays original vintage  concert graphics with live concert footage to tell the story of personal tragedy he and his family have endured from war. The raw honesty and poignant emotions added by Roger Waters only enhanced the story behind the music. I thought this concert paid homage and deep respect to the casualty from war or civil unrest. Roger returns to the stage with a brilliant and powerful presence.,1484870400,,534,4.680851063829787

I can appreciate their place in the history of music and the influence they've had but really I'm into punk, so initially the thought of watching a 70-something Roger Waters perform The Wall live from cover to cover wasn't very appealing.  Then I saw this and I have to say, if you're reading this and you haven't seen it, you are truly missing out.  My only regret now is that I did not get to see this in person.",1484870400,,533,4.247524752475248
7446622,5,B015RD3AHO,"I've watched the original ""The Wall"" film many times.  And I've watched the film of the performance at the Berlin Wall. I enjoyed this version the most.  It's a very different experience watching only Waters sing almost all of it.  In some ways, the road trip in the video was a distraction.  But then - when I hear a masterpiece of music like this (original release was two albums), it makes me wonder about the creative process.  How does a person get possessed to create something like this?  Something so broad sweeping, so personal, so universal.  I truly enjoyed hearing it from the soul of its creator.  Additionally, the graphics on the wall that is built on the stage are stunning and spellbinding.  I can't even imagine what it was like to be in the audience.  It's the kind of big, amazing project I'd love to be part of, but how often does something like this come along?  Once - and it's already here.",1484784000,,914,4.512195121951219

7446631,5,B015RD3AHO,"Great audio and video quality on my mid-to-lower-end home theater.  Pretty much the same concert I saw in 2010, on a much larger outdoor scale.  I was skeptical of going back then, given that I didn't consider Roger Waters to be a terribly dynamic performer on his own.  I was happily proven wrong.  It ended up being one of the best concerts I've seen, and was far more than just a note for note recreation of the original album.

This documentary intersperses the entire concert with scenes of Waters traveling to visit the memorial to his father in Anzio.  Some of this scenes are a bit surrealistic, and I'm still not sure who the others he was interacting with were, but it ends up being very moving and shows a human side of Roger that you don't often see in interviews.

Definitely a good souvenir of the concert, expanding on the studio version of ""The Wall"" and throwing in some pointed but non-intrusive political commentary along the way.  If we're never going to see a reunited Pink Floyd, this is a fine substitute!",1483142400,,1028,4.579234972677596

In 1979, when the album came out, you could muster up some sentiment for Waters and his continuing ages old plight. But fast forward to 2016 and view the film with the knowledge of the atrocities that happen every hour around the world and this self-serving video with it's 40 year+ whining bitch quickly becomes a load of shite.

After several years of scrutiny and absorbing the words and concepts I was prepared for the feature film.

7446694,4,B015RD3AHO,"I am a lifelong Waters fan. This concert footage was assembled from various nights on the tour so it is not cohesive. Add to that the lack of ability to just watch the concert without the constant interruption of Roger driving through the countryside made me deduct a star, Otherwise, it is a moving document of the few years he spent touring this show. It cannot do the show justice on the little screen and perhaps that is why he chose to make this a semi documentary.",1475366400,,470,4.413793103448276
7446695,5,B015RD3AHO,"There already has been plenty written about the content of this disc.  I agree with much of it, and also would have preferred to see more concert and less documentary, but this disc is labeled as a documentary, so I feel there is little to be critical about as far as content is concerned.
That being said, what I absolutely loved about this disc is the Atmos encoding.  I just finished revamping my system to an Atmos 5.2.4 (from a 7.1) and this was the first Atmos content that I played on it following install, setup and Audyssey XT32 calibration.  It was 1:00 in the morning by time I got around to popping this disc in.  I was not prepared for what I was about to experience, but as soon as the concert footage started in chapter 3, I was hooked by the fantastic audio and effects of the Atmos 3D audio.  At the end (and climax) of chapter 3, I knew I was not going to bed until The Wall had run it's course.
When the show was over...I was ecstatic knowing this was just the beginning of my Atmos listening pleasure.  I am now looking forward to more titles being encoded in this new format.",1475280000,3,1096,4.270531400966184

You would think that it was going to be a concert but not really,when are you going to release an actual concert of this ""THE WALL"" I saw the concert it was incredible the graphics on the wall were extremely the most fantastic scenes I have ever seen,the Music was so good,Why is there not a concert version of The Wall . I don't know,but what I do know is that Roger Waters is pushing his fan base further and further to not like him in this role away from Pink Floyd.",1473552000,8,795,4.135483870967742

7446721,4,B015RD3AHO,"This concert film is not only appealing because of the music of ""The Wall"" presented by Roger Waters
and his band, but because of the story behind the stage. The story reveals the anti-war message and
the movie offer to the viewer other surroundings than the actual stage. But don't worry, we have the
complete show here. The fact that it was not only a concert made me appreciate more the music of
""The Wall"" which has never been my favorite Pink Floyd album. The visuals are spectacular in this
super production with the big wall, the lights mainly in the red color and the projections on the
screen. The musicians are almost out of the picture, except Roger. The surround ""atmospheric"" sound
place you in the show. And on top of that, you can watch this in plenty of languages choices with
the subtitles, while this is more important in the extras with the documentary. In the extras, you
can see David Gilmour played ""Comfortably Numb"" on top of the wall. My favorite parts of the show
are the atmospheric songs outside the typical rock songs of the ""Another Brick in The Wall"" suite.
The story behind the concept of ""The Wall"" is beyond the simple anti-war message, but is also based
on the concept of alienation that humans fear in their lives in general. The idea of Roger Waters to
dedicated this show to the people who have died in the war is really touching considering the fact
that his father and grandfather died in this situation so that his universal message of peace has a
personal resonance on him. Recommended not only to music listeners, but also those who enjoy a good
musical movie.",1470268800,,1603,4.588850174216028

Withing the first few minutes with the airplane and fireworks, I was exhausted!!! The artistic nature of this concert is unreal.

When Ticket sales started I was disappointed because of how expensive the Tickets were... I never got to see the concert and was hoping for a dvd to be released... Roger Waters did a one night one showing in theaters The tickets were $18 so I bought 2... When I got to the theater and saw his movie it was better than expected... I was thinking it would be a video of the tour... What I got to see was an amazing beautiful eye candy spectacular event... My eyes didn't look away once... The movie I watched was a so good... The movie was the concert along with some deeply moving moments in Waters' life... The concert was more beautiful than I expected... It was so good the only way to improve the show was if the rest of the band were there to play... I went home and pre-ordered the Deluxe edition Blu-ray.... it was exactly the same as what I saw in the theater and I was thrilled with my purchase... I still watch it once a week at least...

The only disappointment was that I was hoping to watch just the concert as an extra... the interruptions of Waters' story were great but I was hoping to be able to watch the concert from beginning to end as an option... I also wished there would be a 3D version as it would be even better...

I highly recommend the purchase of this product, the sound is fantastic, the concert was more stunning than I expected, The visuals during the concert were amazing and much better than awesome... buy this product you will not be disappointed... you will be awestruck and left with your jaw  dropping.... maybe Waters will release a concert only disk and I hope there would also be a 3D version...

7446775,5,B015RD3AHO,"First off, John s. Harris, from everyone whom I know that has seen this dvd/blu-ray, most all of them being big time Floyd fans, truly ate this up. All of your little bitchy comments on "" oh, this isn't a good concert film, it's too personal with waters' life, etc. not enough concert"" are your own ignorant ridiculous perspectives, as this is what Waters was trying to do. If the concert is all you wanted to see, well then one should have figured a way to get there, or find a bootleg recording. You got to see it 3x, and would you have just wanted to see exactly what you saw in concert? If so, you should have brought a video recording device like I did. I cherish the video  I was able to make, and a couple years later when this video came out, it was an entirely different and personal experience that truly touched me in a big way, DUE to all the extra personal footage, as my own father passed right between concert, and movie release. It really hit a nerve, as Floyd has always done for me. Your large review is just gonna throw off a lot of fans who didn't see the concert, or even ones who did because you're putting Waters down for really opening up in a much more direct way, that's what the film is all about. I think a lot of it has to do with all c the stupid theories people think the wall is really about. you're beating a dead horse on ""this is not a concert film"" now in waters' older years, i feel he wanted to clear a couple things and rather than being so metaphoric as he was back in 70's I also disagree that it's mostly autobiographical, but just as much throwing out his strong political views, anit-war/violence/discrimination, and things of that nature. But you go ahead and pout about little trivial things such as showing the audience too much?!?! I think That's done a lot of the time to show how  floyd/waters /... in this case especially the floyd music has a fan base from like 10year olds, to quite elderly folks, who are ecstatic to be seeing what they are seeing, in whatever F'in launguage. It also serves as a clearer explanation into the song meanings and concepts that perhaps most of the young listeners won't quite pick up on, as they haven't had years of listening to/ watching the wall and all the rest of floyd work. When I was in my teens 20+years back, it was common misconception upon listeners my age that I hung out with that all the sounds, lyrics, lights, etc. were simply there for the psychedelic crowd, or just drug music in general.

The concert footage is interspersed with footage of Roger revealing his personal odyssey to Italy to visit the cemetery for the WW2 battle dead where his father died when Roger was a young boy.
It's very introspective of Roger to share this with his fans and gives all of us insight into what made Roger, Roger and how he came to write The Wall.
Having seen Roger perform The Wall three times in Texas and the final performance on the Plaines d'Abraham in Quebec City Canada, I highly recommend this film. It  captures what a fantastic performance, and what it was like to experience The Wall.",1461542400,3,843,4.403846153846154

It was sort of dry and although very clean and clear, it lacked the energy captured during the live performances. Maybe a bit more reverb here and there would have helped.

7446814,5,B015RD3AHO,"I LOVE THIS FILM! This is the first film that has touched me to the core in quite a while...  If you know Waters' work with Pink Floyd you already know the premise behind The Wall and The Final Cut... and that Waters is anti-war and anti-isolationist.  The way this was presented in the theater was simply amazing, especially the conversations in between the concert footage. The sound quality is very good indeed (do you ever expect any release from Pink Floyd as a whole or or Waters or Gilmour to have sound quality anything less than excellent?), the video quality is good, and the only thing that I really notice missing on the blu-ray release was the slide show, shown on the big screen leading up to the opening of the film (I have not yet checked out the bonus materials on the discs).

The concert - the acting was rather good, especially for a concert film. You get the typical Pink Floyd trappings - Algie the flying pig (okay, it's actually not Algie as Algie has dry rotted long ago, but a surrogate pig ;)), the school master, and so on. Wall being built - check. Band playing behind the wall? Check. Fully automatic machine guns? Check. Social commentary on racism, fascism and warmongering laced throughout every element? You got it. Brillant packaging. collectibles, booklets? Check. Check. Check. New takes on old material? Check. Studio sound quality on a live production (always a very difficult thing to achieve)? Check!

It makes me regret even more not making it to The Wall concerts (I only ever went to Gilmouir-led Floyd concerts... being too young to see them before the division/breakup).  This film is the next best thing to seeing them at a live show.  :-(",1459209600,3,1686,4.679054054054054

He also found a great backup singer and an awesome guitarist. In addition, I really loved some of the personal clips he edited into the his story. I say that because it did seem as though The Wall was his story being that his father served and died for his country fighting the Germans. Also using the wall as a visual screen was simply genius.

7446876,5,B015RD3AHO,"This is about the Blu-ray version of Roger Waters The Wall.
I have a great library located in San Francisco, CA that gets great titles such as this.
I had the opportunity to view and hear this in both DVD and Blu-ray.
All I can say is that the Blu-ray version is awesome!  The sound is definitely a step ... as the DVD version sounds muddy at times.
I have to say that the model were you get an opportunity to experience it and then decide if you want to buy it.
I have had the opportunity to experience it and now I will buy it!  I would not buy the DVD version based on the sound.

My audio/video setup is as follows:
Receiver Pioneer SC-25
Speakers:  Bose 901 Left and Right, Harmon Kardon Center and Rear Left and Right,  (no sub woofer)

7446903,5,B015RD3AHO,Cannot say how much I love this new Roger Waters movie. It is new and totally up to date (2013 I believe). Shot in wide screen. Sound is awesome. New twist to the whole Wall concept being that Roger adds a personal twist to the whole thing that I don't want to spoil but I really liked it a lot to say the least. Most of it is the live Wall show with some brief periods of the Roger Waters creativity and the personal journey I refereed to in between some of the songs but very well done. Very cool to see that he has taken the live Wall show to this level. If you are a Pink Floyd fan or Roger Waters fan this is absolutely worth the watch. I have had it as soon as I could order and I have watched it about five times now.,1454198400,,724,3.865771812080537

7446905,1,B015RD3AHO,"I saw the live show TWICE, the editing of this video (specially the concert part is SO BAD)
Those concerts were beyond awesome, and this DVD/Bluray does not give me 1/1000000 of the feeling the real concerts did

a) the camera selections,
It comes quite obvious on the ""comfortly numb"" track that they did not choose good ""takes"" what makes me think the cameramen where fools... i want a close up of the guitar solo. I want to feel inmerse on the inmensity of that HUGE stage. Instead at least 1/10 of the video time is spend focusing on the crowd (I don't care about the crowd, besides they focus on the same people over and over)

b)the editing...
Honestly i would have prefered the Roger waters doc on his ancestry as an ""opening act"" before the concert or as a bonus feature rather than the mixed approach they used, it breaks the timing and ""the feeling

c) the had NO EXCUSE for above said mistakes, they had nearly THREE YEARS to edit it, (and many concerts to ad ""missing shots"" to the final mix

I have seen DVD's from concerts I have gone to, which had way less time before releasing the DVD (2 months) and way less money, ending up WAY BETTER THAN THIS.",1454112000,8,1164,4.375
7446906,2,B015RD3AHO,"What I had high hopes for was a full concert movie, what we get is a somewhat self indulgent semi-documentary about Roger Waters attempt at coming to terms with the loss of his father in WWII. The concert footage is intermittently cut with Roger Waters either talking, taking a road trip in his car to see his Dad's grave (with his brother) etc. All that is well and good but would have been best served as an extra feature separate from the concert. What it does do is take you right out of the concert, and the cut-a ways seem to always be when your just getting into the concert which completely ruins the expectations and anticipation you had to relive it via the dvd....To sum it up for me this dvd is a HUGE disappointment, I hope at some point they simply release the full concert straight through, that's what I think most fans who attended the concerts live would have liked as well as those who could not.",1454112000,8,915,4.3882352941176475

7446932,5,B015RD3AHO,"I managed to catch the live show of this tour twice as it came through my city in both 2010 and 2013.  Seeing it live was simply incredible, so when I heard that Waters was going to put it out as a live Bluray/CD, I was really excited.  However, Waters took it one step further by filming a mini-movie that is interspersed throughout the concert footage, featuring him and a companion driving to visit the graves of fallen soldiers in, I believe, Anzio, where his father was killed just after Roger was born in the 40's.  The audio/video quality of both the concert and the film footage is spectacular, and the music is, well, The Wall!!  Roger's masterpiece is really brought to life here and even if you're more of a Pink Floyd fan vs. Waters solo, a bonus feature is the one show that David Gilmour and Nick Mason returned for to perform Comfortably Numb (Gilmour on guitar, vocals) and Outside the Wall (Mason and Gilmour) that you can watch.  So it's really a no-brainer for any Floyd fan.  Highly recommended!!",1453248000,,1016,4.554945054945055

It's kind of a cheat to take the autobiographical story of a whiny spoiled ass of a rock star and claim it's an anti war parable. That said - Roger owns the fact that he was a jerk, and has an honorable mission. So - it all balances out.
What this blu ray sorely needs is a concert-only edit. With less shots of delirious audiences. Two viewings of Mr. Waters' automotive journey to honor the past are enough to last me quite some time, but I could watch the concert performance forever.",1452556800,,725,4.458646616541353

7446968,4,B015RD3AHO,"I saw The Wall Live at the O2 in London in 2011 and it was an amazing, unforgettable audio-visual experience. This is a film of the same concert, shot somewhere in France, and interspersed with movie bits (none of which is long, though) dealing with Roger's loss of his father in WWII. I would have preferred just the concert and perhaps it would have been a better idea to include the documentary as an extra, just as ""Behind The Wall"" was in the Berlin 90 DVD.  However, if you're interested just in the concert you can just skip the movie bits and go straight to the songs in the main menu. The video and sound quality of this DVD in general is very good. Some lenghty parts of songs are sung by other members of Roger's crew and I think it would have been better still if Roger alone had sung them, one of the things that struck me when I attended the show is that despite his age he keeps his great voice. The DVD has very little extra material, just two time-lapses of the shows at Buenos Aires and Athens but it would have been nice to include at least the clips of the songs ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Outside the Wall"" at the O2 in which David Gilmour and Nick Mason appeared singing along with Roger, and perhaps a documentary about The Wall Live tour itself, just as in the Berlin 90 and Pulse DVDs. However, if you like Pink Floyd and ""The Wall"" this is certainly a must-see and must-have.",1451692800,,1398,4.315589353612167
7446969,4,B015RD3AHO,"The Wall of course is an epic album.  This version of Mr. Waters most recent (and, hopefully but unfortunately) 're-telling' of the tale is masterful albeit a bit contrived.  It is a bit draining and having watched it last night New Year's Eve (a usual depressing night for me) was probably not the best time to devote to this screening but it is amazing.  I kick myself for having not seen this tour but economic (I think I saw tickets on various sites going for $400.00 a pop at the time) and other circumstances made that an impossibility.  This collection is a pretty darn good alternative.  I never did get to see Floyd back in the day (another sad regret) but these CDs, videos, etc. are welcomed recollections of things some of us grew up with and trying to 'understand' Mr. Waters' interpretation of this epic certainly warrants telling.  That being said (as Larry David might say) I was a bit mystified by the concert footage being interspersed with Mr. Waters and his travels to Anizo to visit the memorial where his father died as well as visiting along with his children his grandfather's grave (who died in World War I).  Along the way  in his lovely Bentley (or is that a Rolls--is there a difference these days?) he is accompanied at times by different companions--I don't know if they are friends, stand ins for his father and/or grandfather, brothers or other people.  I haven't ventured into the bonus material so maybe that has some answers....

My father was in the U.S. third division infantry.  He didn't like to talk about the war other than to say he did see horrible things and I only vaguely know of his circumstances.  He survived and I have his bronze star and Purple Heart that I 'inherited' after he passed away 17 years ago this past December.  I only recently did learn that he was at Anzio (where the third dis ion lost 900 men IN A SINGLE DAY) it makes my own circumstances obviously pale in comparison.  So when Mr. Waters visits these memorials (with no one around) and I'm left to wonder are his tears real or simply playing to the cameras which is probably pretty cynical of me.  These men obviously didn't die in vain but for noble causes...and plainly Mr. Waters' father would be ""extremely proud.""",1451606400,,2238,4.602015113350126

This is truly a fantastic adventure, and I might add, a much better film than ""in The Flesh"" . I think any Pink Floyd fan will truly enjoy this concert. I certainly did.

I wanted to buy the DVD hoping it would be a concert video to keep and remember the concert experience.  But there are too many interruptions.  It would've been better if the filmmakers gave us the concert as an uninterrupted piece, and then included an additional 30 minute documentary on Roger Waters' reflections about his father's death from WWII as separate chapters.

Also, the film's editors could've done a better job editing the concert footage.  The Wall concert itself is not only a musical experience but a strong visual experience too.  They only show short flashes and snippets of the animations and character dolls, such as the School Master or flying pig dolls, etc.  While at the concerts, watching the animations and flying pig etc, accompanying the music is what makes it such a one of a kind experience.

7446991,3,B015RD3AHO,"I am surprised by all the rave reviews regarding the sound and picture quality. My son and I discovered that we had both bought The Wall for each other for Christmas. We decided not to wait until then to watch it. This won't be my typical in-depth review. I own umpteen versions of The Wall. Here is my take on the blu-ray version of ""Roger Waters The Wall"".  The sound in this latest incarnation is lacking in highs, lows and dynamic range. The picture is pretty grainy, dull and blurry. I believe dull and grainy may be intentional, however my son and I both really miss the sharp, colorful images projected onto the wall that we experienced at the actual event several years ago when we went as a family. Besides feeling like I have cotton in my ears and light fog before my eyes, the soundstage mix is strange. Understand that there is documentary type footage interspersed with the concert footage, which is fine, but the concert does not have the feel of a concert. Instrument localizations are often not cohesive with the picture. They are at times forward of the picture as if in the middle of your head, or off to your side, and even the audience mix seems disconnected. I remember being especially impressed with the clarity and impact of the low frequencies at the actual concert- not so here. I am very disappointed with the sound and picture and find it does not match the immense scale of the original 1979 LP, The Wall tour of 2010-2013, or the story itself.  Great concert movie, but from a fidelity point of view, this is not up to the standards you would expect from Roger Waters or Blu-ray. BTW, the DVD has the same lackluster mix. Seriously, because it sounds so unexpectedly poor, I had load a familiar disc to be sure nothing was wrong with my system.",1450742400,3,1774,4.5233644859813085
7446992,5,B015RD3AHO,"I will just simply say that I fully agree with all of the 5 star reviewers.  I agree even stronger with the ""8 STAR REVIEW"" posted by a reviewer.  Most excellent!  Not any words that can fully describe the experience of this movie, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have an ""above average"" sound and visual system.  Incredible experience.  I saw The Wall Live twice during the recent tour and I am please to have this to re-live the experience again and again.  And again.",1450742400,,482,4.546511627906977
7446993,4,B015RD3AHO,"I came to this blu-ray expecting a trainwreck, but was pleasantly surprised and can easily say it's an entertaining view and adds something new to the well-worn idea of The Wall.  Where I have issue, it's more that the ambitions of this production didn't quite hit their mark.  Read on...

First, with regard to the ""asides"" in this film, my only real gripe is that there are incidental scenes of Roger driving around while the band plays more ambient portions of the album.  There were a few points where I found myself going, ""What was the point of that?"" or ""Wait...  Why did you take the view off the stage NOW?  I wanted to see what was happening!""  Fortunately, those moments are never long-lived and never seem to impact the ""action"" of the stage show.  They're a light nuisance at the worst, which is excellent because descriptions of these scenes in other reviews made me think it was going to derail my enjoyment of the concert.  I was quite pleased to be proven wrong on that count.

Now, my preference would have been that these scenes act as an introduction to the concert, an interlude between ""Goodbye, Cruel World"" and ""Hey You!"" where there is a break in the narrative anyway, and an epilogue, maybe between ""The Trial"" and ""Outside the Wall.""  Fortunately, the bulk of the outside footage is placed in these three points, so it's pretty forgivable, even if I would still say it comes off a bit self-indulgent.

For the good about the concert itself, the band is tight, the lead guitarist manages to both ape David Gilmour's parts and put a bit of his own stamp on the recognizable leads, and Roger himself is in good voice.  Now, I will confess that there are points where it looks and sounds like he's miming, but it's never obvious enough to take me out of the action and, to be fair, he may simply be in better voice than he's been for a while and any lack of sync between the vocal I'm hearing and his mouth movements may just be down to that old Floyd chestnut of cobbling live releases together from audio and video from multiple gigs more than ""cheating"" on stage.

The spectacle of the show comes across even on the small screen and makes me wonder how powerful an experience it would have been for those lucky (and wealthy) enough to afford tickets close to the front of the venue.  The projections on the wall are astounding and really illustrate how advanced the tech which barely kept up in the original shows has advanced.  Extras on stage and various props also add to the theatrical presentation.  Most surprisingly, for something that had to be choreographed up and down, it never feels stiff or rehearsed.  Always a plus!

When it comes to what keeps me from giving this release a full five star review, I expected the ""roadtrip"" footage would have been the main negative.  Surprisingly, what held the show back was the attempt by Waters to make the story of The Wall ""more universal.""  Watching ""The Thin Ice"" complete with pictures and dates of birth and death for war dead from various conflicts is a powerful story, as are the updates to the segments of the story about war and loss...  However, then you get to the parts of the story about a rock star having a meltdown and emerging as a fascist and it feels like you're watching two separate shows.  This is mostly true when you get to ""Don't Leave Me Now,"" ""What Shall We Do Now?"" and ""Young Lust.""  The tone and focus of the narrative go from the macro to the micro and it's far more jarring when the story is no longer about one man's disconnection and withdrawal from the world, but the things that make ALL of us withdraw and disconnect.

On a musical and theatrical level, it's still an enjoyable experience and I will definitely be watching it more than once, but it does feel like some of Waters' ambitions for creating a new, more universally relatable narrative would have done better if he'd just written a new, more universally relatable narrative instead of trying to expand on an existing one.  The Wall is inherently a selfish, introspective story and doesn't lend itself well as a whole to this new inclusive viewpoint.  What made it connect before is that those of us who latched onto it recognized ourselves in this rather unsympathetic rock star figure and had our moment of, ""Oh, that was pretty ugly of me, wasn't it?""  It feels a bit like Waters doesn't realize where the strength of his own material lies.

Anyway, it's not enough to sink the ship, but it does hinder it.  Your mileage may vary, but on a spectacle level alone, it's worth a watch.",1450742400,,4561,4.560736196319018
7446994,5,B015RD3AHO,"I saw this show in Philly and LOVED it. As I get older, I seem to enjoy these things more from my living room. This does not disappoint. It would have been nice to have the version of Comfortably Numb with David Gilmour though.",1450742400,,227,4.181818181818182
7446995,2,B015RD3AHO,"Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters!  I was lucky enough to see two different shows of ""The Wall"" including the original concert.  However, this film is just plain awful.  Like others have said, it is NOT a concert video but rather a montage to himself.  Heard it over and over and read the book.  I was really looking forward to a quality video and this it is not.  The recording is flat out pathetic for Roger Waters production.  I never thought he would ever release something this poor.  The audio portion is reminiscent of a concert video shot on a cell phone.  I was unable to sit through the entire movie in my theater.  I may one day play it on my iPad as that is really what the quality of this movie more represents.  Not to mention just how boring this movie really is.

I saw this concert two times when Roger was touring it and I can honestly say, it was one of the best shows I have ever seen. If you missed the concert don't expect this film to give you the same jolt that being there in person would have or the same atmosphere, even in 5.1 Dolby.

WOW, what a terrific show, I would have rated a straight concert film of this show as a four or five, BUT WAIT, the back story of the personal impact of war on people and families, as seen through death of Roger's grandfather in WWI and then his father in WWII is very compelling. This part of the show would add a couple of stars (at least) to my rating, and makes the whole experience very personal. AFTER you watch the movie, make sure to see the Facebook videos, which I imagine were posted during the tour itself, they give a lot of background info on behind the scenes activities such as managing the lights, the puppets, the art and actions projected on the wall, building and tearing down the wall during the show, Roger working with the kids to sing and dance on ""bricks in the wall"" (what part is that? 2, I guess). Also see David Gilmour perform with the band in London, and even Nick Mason! I give it another two stars for the excellent extras. (Yes, there are even more great extras I didn't even mention).

Honestly, I was only going to watch part of the show (I assumed it was just a live concert recording) for a half hour or so the day I got it. Instead I was MESMERISED and watched the whole thing and I honestly felt like watching it again when it finished! I watched the extras the next night.

It turns out my wife bought the DVD for me for Christmas, but I just won a blu ray copy from a local tv station (she told me after I brought it home). I don't own a blu ray player, but it came with a digital copy, so my son, who is a big Wall fan, and I sat down to weatch the film yesterday. I must say the documentary portion only enhanced my enjoyment of the film. Yes, it is obvious Roger is acting (its a film after all!) and by the end I had had enough of his weeping. But other than that I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. And the concert portion was amazing! I can only imagine what it must have been like to be at the shows! But the film is definitely worth the money (I wouldn't cough up the 500 bucks for the deluxe signed set!)!!! If you are a Pink Fl;oyd fan or a Roger Waters fan, this is a great buy. Even if you don't agree with his politics (I dont). Yes there is an anti war message, but I didn't find it over bearing.

The concert footage both audio and video were superb! I didn't find the shared sequences distracting at all-if anything they enhanced my understanding of the insight and grief that went into the making of that great album nearly 40 years ago! I guess it would be nice to be able to just view the concert alone as others have stated but I really loved it just the way it is! Keep in mind that this is erious music with a stern tone, certainly solemn at times(not feel good boogie, that's for sure).Great music mix, wonderful choice of musicians to include the guy from SNL(many years ago)!

This would have been 5 stars if only it would have included a re mastered version of the file ""The Wall"" . I saw the show live and it was an experience not like anything you can get on a disc. The show really needs to be experienced live to truly appreciate it.

The concert footage is good, but it's interrupted by overly-dramatic shots of Waters crying fake tears over the fact that his father - whom he never knew - bought it at Anzio. This whack-job implies that Britain's involvement in WWII (and WWI) was a mistake. (Try waving that liberal flag if the Nazis had occupied England). Finally shut off this nonsense after the scene of him drinking ""alone,"" and using shot glasses to explain the scene at Anzio to the bartender who doesn't understand English. It's too fake for words....

We've been duped by reality television to think that these people are unaware that there is a camera filming them. Someone was staging the action here. Stick with making music, buddy. You're close to a musical genius. But you're still a mean-spirited, self-indulgent twat and you're not fooling anybody...",1449446400,11,859,5.049295774647887

7447028,4,B015RD3AHO,"Having missed the theatrical release of this film in September, I was anxious to get it on Blu ray, especially with the uncompressed Dolby TrueHD audio track.  Unlike the 1990 concert version, Waters dispenses with the numerous featured artists cameos and instead tells his personal story.  Specifically, his coming to terms with the wartime deaths of his father in World War II and his grandfather in WW I.  The concert footage is assembled in various locations but primarily Greece.  Interspersed between set pieces, Waters takes us on a journey in search of his father and grandfathers final resting place.

To be honest, as poignant as it is sometimes, it tends to grind the concert to a crawl.  Whether this gets in the way of your appreciation of the performance is up to you.  The skip button is always available if you get bored.  The concert footage is what I came for and it is stunningly beautiful.  Both to look at and to hear.  This concert is considerably more serious than the 1990 show, eschewing much of the silliness of that earlier performance.  And as hard as it is to believe, this show is bigger both in production value and musical orchestration.

Waters, who bailed on Pink Floyd shortly after the album came out in 1979, left with ownership of The Wall and little else.  He is constantly dabbling with the show, expanding the original track list and constantly adding variety.  Still, the show is pretty much an extra-long play of the album.  Waters has some great musicians with him including some in long standing with his band.  Guitarists G. E. Smith, Snowy White and Dave Kilminster take turns on the lead with the later providing a stunning solo on Comfortably Numb.  The disc is a must own for fans.

The Blu ray package includes a Digital HD disc in addition to the Blu ray.  The transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  You won't find the video anomalies associated with the 1990 DVD concert here.  The film looks great on the disc.  One of the things that always stands out in night time concerts are black levels.  They are inky black here.  Colors are near perfect and are especially vibrant in the reflective pieces as Waters tools around the countryside in his Rolls Royce.  Excellent detail permeate the film throughout, especially notable as the camera closes in on Waters well-worn but rugged face.  Some of the hand-held camera shots are a bit loose but otherwise, the movie looks great.

The audio performance is even better.  Along with the Dolby TrueHD 7.1, there is an option for Dolby Atmos for those lucky enough to have made that hardware jump.  For purists with a stereo set-up there is also a lossless PCM 2.0 track.  Suffice it to say the bombastic audio with tickle your ears and rattle your rump depending on the size of your subwoofers.  The film has a wide dynamic range including some of the quieter moments when Waters ceremoniously plays a trumpet in honor of his forebears.  The audio is demo-worthy.

There are too many subtitles to list but if you need Bulgarian, Greek or Mandarin you're covered.  And yes English SDH.  This package includes 80 minutes of bonus features including a series of Facebook Films (58 minutes) featuring brief snippets of the tour (2010-2013).  Also, Comfortably Numb performed live at O2 in London with David Gilmour and Outside the Wall also at O2 with Gilmour and Nick Mason.",1449360000,10,3401,4.753846153846154

7447033,5,B015RD3AHO,"I could probably sum this up in two words:  Buy it.  I am not going to bother going in to the details of the premise of the film itself as that has already been established.  I will say that I have a LOT of concert DVD's and Blu Ray's from a variety of bands and this is by far the best sounding concert film I have yet to experience.  This isn't Pink Floyd -you would think the title would give that away - but Roger Waters gathered an impressive cast of musicians for this tour and his musical vision is fully fleshed out on some of the songs.  From the first exploding riff of In the Flesh (Part 1), to the final dramatic chaos of The Trial, you are engulfed by a perfect mix of at times numerous instruments and vocals and does it ever sound glorious.  As if that weren't enough, visually it is absolutely stunning.  Cuts of not only Waters himself, but of his fellow musicians and shots of the crowd are blended almost to perfection.  The stage show itself - with giant puppets and the wall itself being used as a backdrop for a constant barrage of visuals - is captured in all it's glory.  I don't want to just concentrate on the concert either as the actual shots of Waters on his travels to Italy capture the feeling of the internal search Pink is going through in the story of The Wall perfectly, which I'm pretty sure was at least part of the plan for this film.

Extra's include 2 songs from 02 show, with David Gilmour performing Comfortably Numb and Nick Mason joining at the end for Outside the Wall.  You also get a slew of interviews with Waters promoting the film, talking about the savages of war-with at times a more than slight political bent- and also showing Waters with the crew and other musicians.  There are also visits from Waters to other locales of past fallen war heroes, the most interesting being that of A Visit to Frank Thompson.

In closing, I wasn't fortunate enough to see this tour live and I'll kick myself for an eternity for that, but this release is a wonderful parting gift from a visionary artist who appears to have finally broken through his own personal wall for what should be documented for years to come as the highest standard for a performance release on any format.",1449273600,4,2218,4.393643031784841
7447034,5,B015RD3AHO,"First of all, to set the record straight, it is the complete concert. It is interrupted by Waters ""odyssey"" which he intersperses throughout the movie. That being said, the video and audio are awesome. The production is great, though it is not just a concert film. I think he did that on purpose, to give the show new meaning and depth. As in: war now is just as bad as it was when he was a boy...and governments and corporations and all that. Yes, there are great bootlegs circulating of the complete show back to 2010. I think he knows that too, so here is a little different version. A little more polished, a little more professional. I too saw the concert, the original with Pink Floyd in 1980, and this one twice. You can never compare a film to the live event. But on the whole, I was blown away by the film. I give it 5 Stars.",1449273600,,834,4.251572327044025
7447035,4,B015RD3AHO,"I was a little concerned that video clips interspersed during the concert would ruin the flow but additions were tastefully done and added a back story to the concert.

I realize the concert covers the entire Wall album - some songs I am not a fan of and the concert is a bit long, so I deducted a star.  If you are a huge fan of the entire album you will no doubt rate it a 5.",1449273600,,527,4.028846153846154

I am usually not a fan of interspersing concerts with story telling, but I very much enjoyed how this was put together. I would prefer that you would be able to choose concert only on repeated viewings, but in this case, I am ok with it. You can simply hit the fast forward button on the couple of extended pieces.
And again, I must make special mention, that in my collection of hundreds of concerts, the sound quality and design on this disc, are at  another level compared to all but a very few.

I have played it on a few different systems, both PC as well as blu ray with optical audio to a home theater system. I have not been able to stand listening to the whole thing.  It is that bad.  I do agree with the others that the embedding of Water's journey across Europe throughout the show distracts from the experience. It would have been better to at least give the viewer the option to select their preference.",1449273600,2,554,4.368932038834951
7447038,4,B015RD3AHO,"I was fortunate to see this concert live, and I count It among the most spectacular and moving that I have ever experienced in my life. I found myself looking forward to the concert footage I knew would one day be available.

I was nine when 'The Wall' was released and was exposed to it when my brother bought it, along with 'The Final Cut', at thirteen. I was instantly won over and still count 'The Wall' as a desert island album to this day.

Because of this long term appreciation of the record, I must have read and seen dozens of interviews in which Roger Waters, with surprising patience, over and over explained the inspiration behind 'The Wall' ... the infamous moment during the 'Animals' tour, the personal tragedy that so evidently shaped his life and his views. I felt I had a very good grasp of his motivations as the writer.

Even so, I found myself fascinated by the documentary portion of the film, (shot beautifully incidentally), in which we see and hear Roger give us unparalleled access to the forces behind his drive to compose this classic work.

I also understand his need to allow this access to be inexorably interwoven into the concert footage. His personal story and the narrative of the record have lines that blur intensely.

My regret, however, is that I will want to experience the concert as a musical journey without anything to pull me away, however poignant and beautifully shot. 'The Wall' is, first and foremost, a brilliant record and should be allowed to shine in that way. Let the music speak for itself. I really wish there were an option to see the concert without the documentary inserts, and since the technology clearly exists that makes that an extremely easy request to execute, it is disappointing that it wasn't done.

In a similar vein, when I saw 'The Wall' live I was on the center of the floor but not up close, and I consider myself fortunate to have had that vantage point. The show is so grand in scale and so magnificent, that I wish an option on the Bluray had been to simply select a static camera taking in the concert like I did, so as to not miss anything this visionary show delivered. I know plopping a HD camera on a tripod at the sound console is hardly technical filmmaking, but it would have been so nice to have that option. And, once again, not difficult to execute on Bluray.

Still. Wonderful sound. Great concert footage from many venues around the world, with the River Plate stadium shows in Buenos Aires (and the typically passionate argentine audiences AC/DC and The Police also featured) getting a big percentage of the overall concert film.

Overall a very worthy addition to anyone's collection. I remain hopeful that perhaps a future release will address the shortcomings of this first edition.",1449273600,6,2777,4.664621676891615
7447039,5,B015RD3AHO,"It's funny, every review I read of this on Amazon, no one, not once, even mentioned this is 7.1 (as opposed to 5.1). Hello, it's The Wall in surround, but not just any old 5.1 surround but 7.1. What's not to like about that? Sounds like Rog may know a thing or two about surround

I watched this last night on my 7.1 system (Dolby TrueHD, not atmos) and was completely blown away. Both the video and audio are reference quality (played through my oppo 93), although, I admit, I may be down to a 6.1 or 5.1 system now since I think one (or more lol) of the bombs or explosion effects may have blown out a speaker or 2. lol, just kidding

I liked how Roger interspersed the concert with the quieter journey and I think virtually all the reviews have completely missed the entire point of this film and of The Wall in general.

Everyone needs to give good ole Rog a break. He's 70 something for God's sake. Can't he just do what he pleases instead of what everyone would like from him. H'mm that sounds vaguely familiar, perhaps from, Oh, I don't know, The Wall itself?

7447042,5,B015RD3AHO,"This is a stunning artistic and social/political achievement. I was in college when The Wall album was released and we spun it on the turntable constantly. The early 80s film with Bob Geldof didn't make much of an impression, but of course the music has always stood the test of time, and become even richer with age. But this masterpiece, an artistically stunning rendering of the soul and sound of The Wall eclipses anything I could have imagined. The music and band are both tight and emotive throughout the concert. The physical and visual effects, from the larger-than-life characters from the songs as well as the pig-blimp to the full-tilt wall that gradually completely separates the band from the audience, as Pink becomes walled off from other humans, to the computer graphics projected onto the Wall throughout the concert, full of dramatic images of planes and terrorized souls and human monsters and planes and bombs and destruction of the human psyche - all these effects perfectly timed with the music combine to mesmerize the viewer. Waters' theme of the loss of his father to a war perpetrated by the puppeteers of death and destruction, our Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Generals, is mirrored in the tragedy of Pink's loss of his own humanity as stardom drives him insane. The visual effects, musicianship, and theatrics evoke almost overwhelming empathy with the characters and humanity's self-abuse. If you ever liked The Wall, you'll love this spectacular recording.",1449100800,2,1490,5.110655737704918

Pales in comparison to Pink Floyd! Roger has been sitting on the original Pink Floyd the Wall Footage for 35 years complaining about the Quality.

7447048,5,B015RD3AHO,"If you fancy yourself a creative person maybe you have touched up an old painting or modified a recipe or two. It might even keep you up at night, or consume your entire life, to feel content and satisfied that you have poured everything into a project. Perhaps you feel you nail things the first time around and are always exploring new ways to express yourself and unleash your creativity. Wherever you land it is impossible to deny how truly epic, profound and personal The Wall is to Roger Waters and millions of bleeding hearts and artists.

I was 9 years old when The Wall came out. It grabbed me then and has entertained, inspired, and simply has been there for me ever since. I have nothing but respect, admiration, and gratitude for Roger Waters and his quest to perfect and share his masterpiece. Ive been waiting for this DVD since I saw The Wall performed live in October of 2012.

The concert was spectacular, most likely the best Ive ever seen. Even with a fifty three inch television, Blu Ray, and a decent sound system I wondered how the DVD would capture the experience. Im writing this in the afterglow of watching it for what will be the first of many times. Experiencing The Wall in the confines of my own home was absolutely awesome. The Blu Ray is stunning visually and sonically. Like many, I would have preferred the film was shot from the best seat in the house and would have enjoyed witnessing the band and theatrics the whole time. Im happy a new generation is enjoying The Wall but there was far too much footage of them singing from their seats for my taste, it is especially awkward during Comfortably Numb. The non-concert stretches were well done, necessary and beautifully shot. I find the negative reaction to them overblown. Highlights for me were Run, Hey You, Nobody Home, Waiting for the Worms, and Mother. Opening and closing the show on the trumpet was brilliant.

I also saw the The Radio K.A.O.S tour many years ago. Beyond that I cant see Ive seen a lot of Roger Waters performing. He was fantastic, undoubtedly proud and enthusiastic. It is evident he lives and dies with every note. His latest permutation of The Wall delivers in a very big way. I will watch this over and over again and recommend you see it at least once.

7447049,4,B015RD3AHO,"Four stars. The movie, concert and updated concept of The Wall as an anti-war, anti-authoritarian piece rate it 5 stars. For me, it's probably the definitive and most complete version of Roger's vision. So that's all good, but I am forced to take a star off for three reasons:

1) No branching blu-ray option to watch the concert only, without the road trip bits. Don't get me wrong - I like the road trip bits, which add to the overall story and concept BUT it's a missed opportunity to make full use of the technology that blu ray offers. Sadly, I've never seen any releases that do, so Rog is not alone in this.

2) There are plenty of extra snippets on the bonus disc (over 80 minutes worth, so says the sticker on the front of the box). However, what is missing is the question and answer session with Roger and Nick Mason called ""Just the basic facts"", which aired with the film in cinemas. Why wasn't this brief, but fun piece included on the bonus disc???

3) Stupid blu ray authoring i.e the ""HOME"" item on the main menu takes you all the way back to the language selection screen and through the subsequent annoying FBI messages. Sigh.

I'm suspecting there's a more full release out there, which includes the 2-CD soundtrack and ""Just the basic facts"", but which isn't the full $500 super-deluxe edition.",1448928000,5,1315,4.5358649789029535

7447052,5,B015RD3AHO,"Full disclosure:  I am a HUGE fan of Roger Waters and ""The Wall"" is my favorite work of his, so I was ready for this tour and very excited to see this film in theaters and released on DVD.

The concert tour was amazing.  The best I've seen in 30+ years as a concert-goer, bar none.  The resulting film is a little more of a mixed bag containing footage from the tour that does amount to a whole show, interspersed with footage of Roger's journey to the sites where his father and grandfather perished in WWII and WWI respectively (which is relevant since those events helped inspire Roger in writing ""The Wall"" back in 1978-79).

For fans of Waters interested in more than just the music, the additional footage is welcome.  It's a rare glimpse at Waters with his guard down being both personal and reflective and at times, and quite comedic at others (and never was he funnier than appearing with Nick Mason  answering fan questions at the film's conclusion when it was shown in theaters; I wish this had been among the bonus features on this dvd!).

But... even as a huge fan, I wonder how well these ""travel"" scenes with Waters will hold up over repeated viewings.  And for those fans interested in just the music, the travel scenes definitely break up the flow and momentum of the concert sequences.  It far from ""ruins"" it imo, but I can see myself skipping those sections when watching this DVD after the first few times.

The concert footage itself is stunning, and yet for those that caught the actual show, it's also *somewhat* disappointing.  I caught this show 4x:  twice in 2010 and twice in 2012.  And I saw it from up close (16th row) from mid-way back off to the side and from the seats in the back directly in the middle of the stage.  The best experience was when I was just a few rows up off the floor, directly in the back, right in the middle; and I say that simply because of the nature of this show:  the ""star"" is not Roger's talented band or even Roger himself; the ""star"" of this show is the show itself:  the wall being built brick by brick, the projections, the special effects, etc.  And being too close actually makes it harder to take all that in, so being back a bit is actually better.  And sadly, the cameras just don't quite fully capture what I saw when at these shows (which is ironic because that's the reason Waters has given for decades as to why the shows filmed with Pink Floyd in 1980-81 were never officially released; he just didn't feel the cameras had captured the essence of the show). It could just be that this show is simply too BIG to be fully captured on camera, which is why imo, Waters should have taken advantage of a very under-utilized feature of DVD: the ""angle"" option. Most remotes have an ""angle"" button and if the DVD features it, you can manually switch between different ""views"". For this, there should be 1 view of the film as originally presented, another with a view of only the footage shot from cameras back a bit to capture the overall stage (where you can see the full wall and everything projected on it) and then another ""angle"" option with only the cameras that were up close and focused more on the musicians on stage.  That could have pretty easily enhanced how much of this amazing concert experience was captured and presented on this DVD and allowed the viewer at home the same option as concert-goers had at the actual show:  the choice to look at the band or the amazing stage presentation/effects any time they wanted.

As for the ""travel"" scenes bogging down the concert footage, that's another easy fix:  on their ""9012Live"" VHS released back in the day, the band Yes gave us footage from their 1984-85 tour that was treated with a bunch of cheesy 80's graphics.  When it was done up for DVD release much later, the option of watching the original film was there, but there was also an option to shed the graphics and watch only the raw concert footage (which is all I ever watch!).  Waters should have given us a similar option on this DVD: first the full theatrical ""film"" version with his travel footage intact, which is what he originally wanted to present and a great watch for those of us fans really interested in Waters the man and not just the concert, but then an option to watch just the concert footage would have been nice as well and not at all hard to execute.

If the producers of this DVD had done THAT, I could see this DVD never leaving my player! As it is, it's still a great film and the concert footage is way, way, WAY better than nothing, but... also something of a missed opportunity too.  It still gets 5 stars from me because I loved every minute of this film in the theater, but for DVD release, it could have been even better.  Flaws and all though, it's still the best version of ""The Wall"" to get on dvd, much better than the 1982 movie and better than Roger's 1990 performance in Berlin too.

EDIT:  I have watched the DVD two times now:  once all the way through, and once ""skipping"" past the travel scenes.  First, the good news:  the offstage footage is really interesting, at least to me, so its inclusion is a PLUS.  Now, the BETTER news:  if you don't like the travel sequences, just hit the ""next chapter"" button and away you go off to the start of the  next song.  It's not quite ""seamless"", but... pretty darn close.  Another reviewer said that the travel scenes were ""mixed in"" with the concert footage and that the chapters did not get you past them easily, but I think they were referring to the fact that there are a few places in the film where the live music is playing but the video is of Roger riding in his car or something of that nature; and that is accurate.  BUT... those moments are pretty few and far between and the bottom line is that if all you want is the MUSIC (with whatever corresponding video is being shown), you CAN hit ""next chapter"" to bypass the ""travel"" scenes where Roger is talking and there is no music playing.  I did this just the other night when I wanted to see this movie but didn't have the full 2+ hours and it was still a fantastic show to take in on my DVD player.

Bottom line:  the best concert tour of the 2010's is now the best music/documentary DVD!  A must have for anyone even remotely interested in the music of ""The Wall"".  With a few tweaks, it could have been even better, but it's still a solid 5-star release just as it is.",1448928000,44,6402,4.407312925170068

Being born in 1980, I never thought I would see it performed live; and if I did, I was sure it would be as a broadway musical. Decades later, I was fortunate to see Roger Water's The Wall live @ Citizen's Bank Park - center stage and approx 20 rows back from the stage. It was the first concert, from beginning to end, that simply moved me - I was truly connected. It was a visceral experience. During the concert, I could see the cameras and knew ""something"" would eventually be released. When I saw this, I was so happy that something other than my own memories, and the t-shirt, would document this monumental event.

7447065,4,B015RD3AHO,"Roger Waters has been my favorite musician for over 30 years.  I have seen him in concert 30 times, including The Wall concert 16 times.  The Wall and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking make my list of 10 albums I'd want on a deserted island.  I can't believe I'm giving a four-star rating to something with Waters' name on it, but The Wall movie does a poor job of re-creating the concert experience.  I think The Wall was the best concert tour in rock history, but the power of the concert is diminished somewhat by the film.  I enjoyed the additional non-concert footage and am happy to watch anything with Roger in it, but why did it have to come at the cost of degrading the concert experience?

Why not include an additional Blu-ray with just the concert with the audience perspective and minimal use of the on-stage cameras and minimal editing?  I will watch the new The Wall movie once or twice, but I want to watch a The Wall concert film many, many times, the same way I've done with everything else Roger has put on video.  Even fast-forwarding through the non-concert footage of The Wall movie isn't satisfying, because a decent amount of the concert is not shown from the audience perspective, and the choice of camera angles and over-editing ruins the experience for me.  Fortunately, there is a fan-produced version of The Wall concert that is much better than the movie version (and from the better, 2010 version of the tour).

Having received and watched the Blu-ray and given more thought to the movie, here are my additional comments:

When I watched the movie in a theater, I liked the opening sequence.  When Roger showed up at the cemetery with a case in hand, I was thinking please have a trumpet and play Outside the Wall and so was blown away when he did (the concerts began with Roger playing Outside the Wall off stage).  My euphoria faded somewhat due to the editing of In the Flesh.  There were several times during In the Flesh that I felt the film didn't catch the concert experience, such as when the platform with the flag bearers rises and during the pyrotechnics.  Do we really need four camera angles to experience the plane flying across the venue?

A Wall concert film should focus on the staging; it doesnt need 1,000 three-second close-ups of the band members scattered throughout the movie.  It seems that the editor has ADD and was off his meds.  Perhaps the editor was paid per edit; in that case, well done, sir!

I appreciated Roger sharing the letter about his Dads death with us (no, not from kind, old King George), but the projections during ABITW I were some of my favorites, and Im sorry that we couldn't have both.  I also felt that the non-concert scene with Roger interrupted the flow from ABITW I to The Happiest Days of Our Lives.  I prefer no interruption of the concert from In the Flesh until Mother ends.

Even Goodbye Cruel World was not shown with a single camera angle.  That was a bad decision.

Is seeing behind the wall during Hey You better than the concert experience of having the wall between band and audience?  The wall concept is lost in the film; its more like a chain-link fence.

The insertion of non-concert footage between Nobody Home and Vera is once again poorly timed.  Bring the Boys Back Home is one of the climaxes of the concert, but the frequent changes of camera angles greatly reduce the impact.  I counted fifty-six changes of camera angles during the film version of Waiting for the Worms; the concert experience of watching the projections from a single perspective was much better.

My criticism is not of Roger but rather the editors.  I am glad that so many people love this movie.  I think Roger is one of the most under-appreciated artists of modern times (you can be famous and appreciated and still be under-appreciated). But the concert was much better than the film.

P.S., I'm waiting for a Blu-ray of The Dark Side of the Moon tour...

The reason I brought that up is because it is so outrageously impressive.  Think about how much it cost you to go to the concert.  He took probably 70 to 80% of that price you paid and put into all the effects you saw, seen and heard at that concert.  He's really trying to makea statement with this concert but it only works if you listen to the words.  It helps to know his background, too.  The man is a genius.  He's also a man that has lived with a lot of pain over his dad.  All of his work since, in my opinion, The Wall has been nothing but dedication towards his beloved dad and, dedication towards making all the relentless and ruthless dictators of the world known for what they really are.  Killing innocent people for what....war.  He's spot on and this film, if you love Roger as much as I do, will make you cry.  At least get teary eyed.

7447069,2,B015RD3AHO,"When it comes to concert films, there are two kinds of people. The first wants to see a concert without any frills. The second wants to see a concert and some extra bits. I fall in the first category.

Having been unable to see the recent live shows of The Wall, I was truly looking forward to this release. Unfortunately, it was incredibly disappointing to watch. The performance footage was excellent but it was fatally marred by a narrative that was woven throughout the film of Waters seeking out the graves of his father and grandfather; each killed in one of the World Wars from the last century. The concert would cut to a scene of him traveling in a lovely old Rolls through the countryside, sometimes with a passenger, sometimes not. Occasionally a ham-fisted ""fantasy"" scene would roll by. This would include a family of refugees pulling a cart of their possessions down a road or a man being shot in a field while a smoking Nazi sat in the car's passenger seat. These cuts absolutely ruined the flow of the concert performance.

I get it. At the core of The Wall is a desperate longing for things/people lost. That is what makes it a great and lasting piece of progressive rock, but let the concert/music speak for itself. The music sounds great, the performance is almost flawless (the one exception being a brutally horrible falsetto in The Show Must Go On), and the presentation is spellbinding. The added storyline detracts from the music and breaks the spell it works so hard to create.

If Waters releases a version of this without the added nonsense, I would be happy to purchase it. For now, I will enjoy the many YouTube videos of the concert from the last few years. Some of them are damn nearly perfect and worth seeking out.",1447891200,11,1747,4.610932475884244

However, the footage of Roger's trip through Europe to Italy is an absolute pain and totally distracts from the concert.

7447076,4,B015RD3AHO,"This film is exactly what you want, plus a little less, plus a little too much more.  It's being marketed as a documentary, not a concert film.  And the reason for that will be apparent when you watch it.

For those who saw Roger's ""The Wall Live"" tour and hope to re-live that experience with this film, you will probably be only partially satisfied.  This is not a straightforward filmed document of the live show.  Rather it is a visual essay of Roger's personal grief interspersed between extended segments of the live show.  Sometimes the camera faces the stage and gives you the audience POV, sometimes the camera is on the stage in and around the band members, and sometimes the camera lingers on the audience members -- far too often and for far too long, if you ask me.  *An interesting thing about some of the audience footage -- most of the fans sing along (of course), but much of the film was shot in Canada where English is not the sole primary language.  You have non-native-English speakers mouthing the words and you can see the odd contortions their mouths make trying to make the ""unusual"" sounds.

With all due respect to Roger Waters and his personal journey to come to terms with his grief over losing his father in WWII, I believe the off-stage travelogue takes up far too much screen time.  It interrupts the flow of the concert.  Make no mistake -- this film is about Roger, not the live concert.  Fans of ""The Wall"" don't necessarily need or want to delve so deeply into the nuts and bolts of what pains Roger Waters personally.  After 35 years of listening to the album, watching the 1982 film, and reading about the concept behind them, we get it already.  At the end of the day, I think most of us just enjoy the music and bring our own joys and demons to the message behind it.  But with this too-personal film, we are asked to experience it primarily on HIS level, not our own.

Not gonna lie:  I wanted a straight-forward filmed souvenir of the concert experience I enjoyed the three times I saw the show live. When I read last year that the eventual release on home video would include snippets of Roger's travels on the healing road, I had no idea there would be so many of them and take up so much time.  Granted, without those extra segments the concert video would run pretty short -- pretty much just the length of the album.  So I guess I can live with a LITTLE padding here and there.  But in my opinion it is just too much and too frequent.

The concert itself has an intermission.  So if Roger needed to include his travel videos in the film, perhaps he could have opened the movie with a short segment, added some more during the break in the concert, and then tacked on some at the end as a coda.  Instead, the movie includes several more breaks in the action in addition to those.

As for Roger's travelogue video:  so we don't have to listen to him muttering to himself or an extended voice-over, he takes one of his buddies along for the ride with him for much of the trip.  So we get to listen to them converse about things that are of utmost importance to them but not necessarily for the average Pink Floyd fan who just wants to relive the concert (or see it for the first time).  It's almost as if the concert itself is secondary, an afterthought.

The concert itself, if you managed to see it in person, was a visual spectacle.  I saw it three times and I enjoyed it from the middle of the arena more than I did when my ticket was in the 3rd row.  The stage and visuals are so large and magnificent that one simply must be positioned a sufficient distance from the stage to take it all in.  Much of the magic is lost when you're too close to the stage.  For home viewing, one wants the optimum vantage point.  But you only get a taste of that in this film.  Especially lacking is the benefit of a good vantage point for the interesting stage visuals during ""Empty Spaces"", ""The Last Few Bricks"", ""One of My Turns/Don't Leave Me Now"" and ""Hey You"".  And the film cuts away from the ""money shot"" in ""Empty Spaces"" that we're all familiar with from Gerald Scarfe's animation.  The film is already rated ""R"", so I don't understand the coyness.

So bear in mind that this film was not designed with the average fan in mind.  It was designed to be a cathartic experience for Roger and we have just been invited to tag along.  Is it worth watching?  Absolutely.  No question.  Is it a little more than you bargained for?  Perhaps.

In short (or is it too late for short?):  if you didn't see the tour in person, this documentary will give you a less-than-ideal view of what you missed.  If you DID attend the tour, this documentary will give you a less-than-ideal souvenir of the show.

One of the promised bonus features is a clip from the tour when David Gilmour guested on ""Comfortably Numb"".  If it's the same performance as his guest appearance in London at the O2 arena [edit: it is], bear in mind that Gilmour flubbed the lyrics and his guitar solo was rather unremarkable.  Embarrassing for Gilmour, but probably satisfying for Waters.

I suppose that in time I might get past my disappointment that this isn't a straight-forward concert film and instead enjoy and appreciate this documentary film for what it is: a portrait of a man's catharsis set against the background of a large-scale artistic endeavor.  In fact I hope I will.  This is a gorgeously-shot film no matter how you perceive it.  But still believe the non-concert narrative could have used a little tightening.

Among the bonus goodies (at least on the Blu-ray) are time lapse videos of the stage being set up in Greece and South America.  It's interesting to see how long it actually took to do it.  And there are nearly 2 dozen Facebook videos of varying lengths featuring various aspects of staging the show and/or Roger's comments about celebrity, culture, etc.  Those are worth a look, for sure.

No denying the stage show was awesome and a spectacular logistical achievement.  But you won't get an uninterrupted viewing of the concert experience, if that's what you are hoping for.",1446508800,397,6107,4.494096276112625

Production:
The concert is captured intimately both in terms of stage feel, short clips of audience participation, and video from both sides of the stage.  Interspersed with the concert are a few short features of Roger on a road trip he takes to visit the graves and war memorials for both his father and grandfather.  In a way, the short features provide an additional wall story within the context of the album, the original wall film, and the new concert tour.  I feel like these features heightened the emotional catharsis of the wall production and did not detracted from the concert.
Visual:
The wall tour will likely remain the most visually stunning concert for decades to come.  The shear power of the projector banks used to produce the wall imagery, the pyrotechnics, lights, animatronics, and the physical building of the wall are all captured here in glorious detail.  I have a 135"" 4k screen and the visuals are clean and vivid.  Forcing a SDR to HDR conversion darkened the visuals a bit but the added color depth made me feel like I was back in my seat at the show.  I still have to hold back tears during the stage reveal of Comfortably Numb
Audio:
Dolby Atmos!  Wow!  I cranked this up on a 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos system and the immersion is spectacular.  The audio does not go overboard with sound shifting, isolation, or other movement effects, which is a good thing.  When these type of effects are used, the immersion is perfect.  Obvious Examples are the plane in the opening scene roaring from behind before crashing into the stage or gun fire sounding in front of you before ricocheting behind you.  More subtle examples are used during ""Is there anybody out there"" when the band is obscured by the wall and the sound provides literal depth to the two dimensional edifice of the stage.
Final Thoughts:
If you are a fan of Pink Floyd, buy this.  If you want a reference quality dolby atmos sound track, buy this.  If you want to know what the greatest concert production of the early 21st century looks and sounds like, buy this.",1533513600,,2205,4.6909090909090905

This is the most amazing live concert production I have ever seen, nothing else even comes close! Absolutely amazing, mind blowing, even if you are not intimately familiar with the music you will recognize the ""popular"" songs and the stunning visuals they project on ""the wall"" throughout the show are simply incredible. I can't believe I missed this tour, I am kicking myself. Roger's voice sounds just like the record, amazing musical performances, a production like none other.",1532476800,,580,4.8686868686868685
8734348,5,B015RD3AHO,"Really interesting film/concert following Roger Waters through the process of dealing with the grief of losing both his grandfather and father to war.  The concert is a grand production somewhere in France using a variety of visual stimuli and stage setups.  I recently went to ATMOS and was looking for some titles that support this audio standard, and this film does a great job in highlighting the Dolby ATMOS capabilities.

I'm not a huge Floyd fan but am keenly aware of their various contributions to art and music over the years.  I was super impressed with the production quality of this project and even moved by the clips and their relationship to the album content.  So I am extremely pleased with this purchase and am glad I added it to my collection.  Granted it's Roger Waters and no David Gilmour, but the artists that fill in do a respectable job.",1532304000,,863,4.72
