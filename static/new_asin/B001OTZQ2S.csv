8331514,5,B001OTZQ2S,"Recorded 25 years ago and re-released as a salute to those involved in this beautiful, ground-breaking series pilot, London By Night is packed to the rafters with talent in front of the camera and behind the scenes. It's difficult to grasp that it was shot and edited in a single week, covering two dozen music performances and amazingly intimate showbiz interview segments filmed at Windsor Great Park, the Empire Ballroom in Leicester Square, and Stringfellow's nightclub in Covent Garden.

The full cast and crew list at IMDb is amazing. Supervising producer Kevin Hunt tapped Britain's top freelancers: DP Nick Fry, ace video editor Neil Roberts, engineer Phil Reed, and multi-track location sound maven Andy Hilton. CCL provided five location crews and top-line Ikegami cameras tweaked for film quality images. Director Alan von Altendorf and production designer David Haith delivered something seldom seen on television that's elegant, intelligent, nimble, sexy, respectful, and great fun to watch.

What happens on screen is sort of astounding. For instance, we walk on stage with The Gipsy Kings and see them wow the concert crowd at Windsor, not from a front row seat, but right on stage with them. We go backstage at the Palladium to chat with the star of Showboat, get an impromptu song from the star of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express, and catch ska legends Inspector Tuppence busking on a cool spring night outdoors in Covent Garden.

Jazz great Terry Disley (Acoustic Alchemy) and contralto Sue Shaddock (Moody Blues) perform two original, soaring ballads, and big band leader Roberto Pla rocks the disco floor downstairs at Stringfellow's with hot Afro-Cuban jazz. Motown legend Edwin Starr lights up a fun interview with Peter Stringfellow and then wallops a packed dance floor with his Teldec hit ""I'm A Devil."" The bizarre Afrodizziac fashion competition and backstage antics at the Empire ballroom has to be seen to be believed.

Candid interviews with veteran film actors Nickolas Grace and Robert Addie, TV star Charlene Tilton, and superstar Chrissie Hynde are natural and unrehearsed, just long enough to let us see authentic conversations in stunningly intimate close-up, yet lively and cut right to the meat without hesitation or dawdling introduction. All of the interviews take place in a classy nightclub dining room with quiet, bustling waiters, sexy cocktail servers, and other tables of glamorous guests in the background. Look carefully and you'll see Wall Street billionaires, film producers, royalty, talent agents, barristers, and Page 3 girls smiling and flirting at London's top nightclub in the sexy 90's.",1413676800,,2651,5.289786223277909
8331515,4,B001OTZQ2S,"I stumbled upon this dvd when I was searching for anything about Stringfellow's in London which was/is a famous nightclub.  I remember being in London twenty years ago and having it pointed out to me as a famous haunt of celebrities and so I ordered this show and to my surprise, I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.  It looked great and gave a feel of actually being in an exciting nightclub, surrounded by the beautiful and the famous.  I think it must have been produced in the early 1990s.

Peter Stringfellow was a most charming host and a good interviewer and his conversations with Nickolas Grace and especially with Edwin Starr were very good.  Edwin Starr performed a song and it was certainly one of the high points of the show to me.  The Terry Disley Band was also very good.  The show closed with a performance outside of the club at a concert by the Gipsy Kings and that was also excellent.  The links between segments were cleverly done and included some buskers performing at Covent Garden - really brought back some fine memories.

I only gave it four stars as there were a few too many interviews by others that weren't quite so good although Charlene Tilton, the star from the original Dallas was interesting.

All in all it was quite delightful and better than I expected.  It made me feel part of the beautiful people being in a beautiful and exciting club and then surprised to find that many of the celebrities were very charming people.",1358121600,,1469,4.547528517110266
