7071803,5,B00UXXF75C,"As an avid anime watcher for over 20 years, I seem to have grown an intolerence to newer anime and for good reason. A good majority of anime that has come out on a yearly basis just isn't cutting for me anymore.  It's the same old  generic opening, characters, story, you know the rest.  There seem to be, (in my humble opion) no real effort in the medium anymore and really good anime are seldom seen, until Ping Pong that is!
Man what a surprise when I finsihed this yesterday, I was blown away and I will watch it again before the weeks over.
It took me all of 5 seconds to get used to the unorthodox animation style, very jagged sometimes, some could even say lazy, yet it works, it flows together beautifully.
The story concerns the coming of age of two hardcore players of ping pong.  We have Peco and Smile, two polar opposite friends who face the trials and tribulations of this intense game.  The show chronicles there rise with their ping pong club to the high school tournament. Facing foreign rivals like Kong from China and past pros of previous years.  One things for certain, this show has heart.  All sports anime's follow the same pattern, as most cliched sports movies.  A rag tag group of individuals get together and give it all they've got in the game with one amature whose hidden potential is brought out by the veteran coach and fueld by a rivarly of a friend or opposing player.
This show has that, yet it's not grossly exaggerated like other sports shows, instead it tackles the material in a cool way. Embracing some cliches, yet focusing more on the characters rather than the next match, its so wonderful.  Every character in this show is fleshed out and even with a short 11 episodes, it never feels wasted, gets right to the point, no annoying filler!  I commend any anime that does't take 50 episodes to get to the final tournament.
The music elevates this seires into a whole other medium.  The  electronic score makes every match seem like life or death and warrants an instant purchase once you finish this show.  Voice acting is strong with everyone giving a heartfelt preformace.  Veteran voice actress  Masako Nozawa (Son Goku in DBZ) is a standout as the chain smoking owner of the table tennis dojo.
I don't want to spoil this show too much for you all.  But I give this anime my highest reccomendation.
The blu ray quality is gorgeous and the opening theme is one I don't skip...ever!
Ping Pong is a breath of fresh air and I hope that other studios follow its example that you can take a familiary story and draw it any way you like,",1435536000,12,2575,4.493562231759657
7071804,5,B00UXXF75C,"Even as a guy who typically doesn't enjoy Sports anime, I think this show is stellar, and well worth watching.",1435017600,6,110,4.55
7071805,1,B00UXXF75C,"Yes this review will get heavily downvoted. I understand. Among some anime groups, especially online, Ping Pong has been hailed as a masterpiece. I've even heard it referred to as the anime that will save the anime industry from boring, repetitive shows about teenage drama and nudity and whatever else teenage boys watch.

However, Ping Pong was a big disappointment- especially given the praise I've heard about the show before watching it. I watched the entire series in a single day- waiting for the good moment of the show to arrive. But it never did. Ping pong is a boring show that features several unlikable characters. The main character in particular is supposed to have this deep, touching backstory that explains the name we know him by. But I can't help but feel absolutely no sympathy towards him- as he is just so difficult to relate to and to like. Perhaps others find it easier to relate to his character- but I couldn't and perhaps that is what ruined the series for me.

The story itself I found to be very generic. Typical ""I wanna be the best"" type sports story. Characters stop playing the sport for some period of time. Some play the sport cause its their source of happiness. Others feel its their duty. This isn't a revolutionary story by any means.

Music was okay and animation + graphics were fine. Overall the series is far from the 10/10 series everyone claims it to be. Generic and bland- it offers nothing revolutionary to the anime genre and as an avid anime watcher- I put this anime as among the worst I've ever seen.",1447632000,,1552,4.636363636363637
7071806,5,B00UXXF75C,"This is not your ordinary anime. The art and animation are bonkers--in the best way! Admittedly, sometimes it is ""ugly,"" but the stylized nature of the character design really comes to life in motion. And the motion adds so much to the story-telling. This is ""haute shonen"" for lack of a better term: it's got lots of action, but it's artfully done. I absolutely loved this series, and cannot recommend it enough. Also, the blu-ray looks waaaaaay better than the version available for streaming. Totally worth it.",1442361600,2,513,4.908045977011494
7071807,5,B00UXXF75C,"You may have no interest in ping pong ( I didn't ), but this well told, simple story is all about characters. Each individuals have their own story line that are a joy to watch developing. Another high point is the visual style, which they kept close to the original author's. It makes the whole serie look more like a small indie project, which is a breath of fresh air in the crowded anime world.",1440892800,,398,4.32
7071808,2,B00UXXF75C,It was an ok movie. Didn't really find it exciting to watch. U would have to be a die hard pingpong fan to like this movie.,1440633600,,123,3.769230769230769
7071809,5,B00UXXF75C,Son loved the addition. To his collection,1439856000,,41,5.0
7071810,5,B00UXXF75C,"Not to be confused with The Ping-Pong Club (Ike! Ina-chuu Takkyuubu), this Ping Pong is based on Taiyou Matsumotos five volume manga series. Unlike the gag series Takkyuubu, Matsumotos Ping Pong takes a serious look into the world of high school table tennis while exploring themes of friendship, motivation, and competition. Opposites in everything but their love of table tennis, the friendship between free spirited Peco and reserved Smile faces new challenges when the competition heats up and the teams coach seeks to unleash Smiles hidden potential.

Ping Pong is a realistic story that lacks the flash and exaggeration of most sports series. Instead of constant competition, I love that the plot revolves around character exploration and interaction. One of the most fun aspects of the series is getting to know its characters little by little, like real people. And though Ping Pong features a popping bgm, it often relies on atmospheric sounds, like bouncing ping pong balls in the gym, to help accentuate its real world feel. Matsumotos distorted art style is the shows most unrealistic aspect. Although Im a big fan, it will definitely turn off some viewers.

Given its narrative style, Ping Pong The Animations whole will end up greater than the sum of its parts, so please remain over the long haul. Nevertheless, Ping Pongs visuals, soundtrack, and realism make it the most refreshing series to come along in a while.",1439251200,8,1431,5.085106382978723
7071811,5,B00UXXF75C,This series rocks. The art style is great. The music is catchy. The characters are likable. This show is 1000 times better than 99% of most anime coming out today.,1437436800,3,163,4.466666666666667
7071812,4,B00UXXF75C,"I haven't watched anime for a long time since I grew up but this show pulled me back. The story is nothing new yet keeps a good tempo, smooth but exciting. Character buildings are great, the development of each character is convincing and steady, I believe all the five guys on the poster found the life they want at the end. The art style of the show is a little bit weird but it actually quite fits the whole atmosphere, the music is no doubt top-notch.

The only reason I gave this product a four star is because the ridiculous chinese dub in the english audio. Kong (a chinese player in the show) and his coach speak perfect mandarin in the original japanese audio, yet somehow Funimation found two voice actors to redo these chinese lines in the english audio. I swear what they said cannot be called chinese and it's definitely not cantonese, I can barely understand it even with the help of subtitles. I don't understand why Funimation would bother translating chinese into chinese but they surely blew it this time.",1437350400,2,1023,4.590163934426229
7071813,5,B00UXXF75C,"Like, REALLY good. One of the best series of all time. This series is seriously what I'd consider to be high art. There's not a single flaw, in my eyes. And my eyes are pretty good at scoping out flaws.",1436572800,4,202,4.075
7071814,5,B00UXXF75C,Never thought a Ping Pong anime could play with my feelings. It is an amazing show and I would recommend this even to people who do not watch anime. Many lessons to be taught.,1435708800,2,175,4.176470588235294

It's a fantastic show. That's all that needs to be said.",1454112000,,144,4.576923076923077
8708694,1,B00UXXF75C,"The show itself is great and normally I'd recommend to to about anyone that enjoys sports anime or stuff a bit out of the ordinary, but be aware that if you're buying this to watch the Blu-ray there is an issue on episode 5 where part of the subtitles are missing. I contacted Funimation's support concerning this and they replied back saying that they verified that the subtitles are indeed missing but that as of right now there are no plans to fix this problem. As far as I know the DVDs in this set are fine so if you only plan to watch those you'll probably be fine. Just know that if you want to watch the Blu-ray some of the subtitles are missing.",1452729600,26,654,4.24
8708695,5,B00UXXF75C,"Ping Pong is an incredibly well written and animated show that has well writtwn flawed characters. These are characters who need more the power of believing in themselves to achieve their golas, as you find in alot of anime. The story ivery well done with many characters but it never seems crowded or unfocused. This is one of my all time favorite animes.",1452643200,,356,4.666666666666667
8708696,2,B00UXXF75C,"I preview on Youtube. I like Ping Pong myself and my Dad was very good in high school. But this Anime was not the best. The artwork was bite cheap. I have not seen this type of artwork in long time. The story pretty much the same. There not much there. As far as the voice over, they did a good job of doing it. I think they could have done it better!",1450656000,,351,3.8219178082191783
8708697,5,B00UXXF75C,"Probably the greatest anime series I have ever watched. Fascinating characters, a rich and dense narrative, and incredibly poetic imagery and animation.

This is a mature, flawlessly executed series about a group of high school kids who play ping pong... but this isn't an underdog sports anime. It's much more a study of these characters, their flaws, and how the game of ping pong represents their position in life, their philosophies, their struggles, and so on.

Please buy this and watch it. If you're a fan of anime, or if you simply love excellent stories well told, this is a must buy.",1450396800,5,593,4.803921568627451
