8611288,2,B00AH8Z1CW,"A charming story with interesting characters in a beautiful setting. And regrettably some of the worst English subtitle translations ever published. Completely unacceptable. I wish all those responsible for this sloppy, juvenile excuse for English translations worked for me. So I could fire them.",1363478400,,297,5.7727272727272725
8611289,3,B00AH8Z1CW,"I saw this movie at the Japanese Film Festival and loved it, hence wanting to buy it for myself and to give as a gift. How disappointing were the subtitles - the movie itself is beautiful, but the subtitles were a poor translation, out of sync and at times nonsensical. A wonderful movie spoilt, unfortunately. The subtitles were definitely not the same as I remember, and I wonder why?",1358035200,4,386,4.608695652173913
