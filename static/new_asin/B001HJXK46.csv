8308794,5,B001HJXK46,"Fantastic. Perfectly done, years worth of material and practice for under $30
I've wasted years of wasting time on youtube (not knowing about theses dvds).
This dvd is one of the best I've seen. Well organized. Each chapter starts with the whole
song played. This is important as some songs you may not want to learn, and it's easy to restart favorites.
Each is followed by complete breakdown of the song in both flatpick and fingerpick [if possible].",1456531200,2,451,4.794871794871795

8308796,4,B001HJXK46,"This DVD will be much more useful to you if you also have Seeger's Folkways CD of the same name, but is plenty useful without it. He plays the songs up to tempo and then breaks down the patterns with the split-screen. It covers a huge variety of styles, from early parlor guitar song accompaniment to various country ragtime fingerpicking styles. He gives background and usually explains a couple different ways a style can be used. Mike Seeger's video lessons are some of the best. The notes that come with the DVD are also excellent (someone has complained they contain no lyrics, but this would take up a lot of space and it's really intended for teaching anyway). It's refreshing to hear him encourage students not to depend on the tab (but the tab is very helpful too).

There are only two downsides to the video: 1) He only plays through the phrases once when teaching. In one of his other Homespun DVD lessons, he shows each phrase three times slowly before moving on to the next. This is understandable, though, when you consider how much material these lessons cover and how much longer that would make them. 2) Seeger often has his guitars tuned down and sometimes plays the songs in different keys than he does on his CD. This is only a problem when you're quickly going from one lesson to another; if you choose a piece to learn and stick with it for a while, it's no big deal.",1420502400,2,1389,4.511904761904762
8308797,5,B001HJXK46,"I've just starting playing guitar, I have an old parlor style Stella and bought some books but happened upon this DVD while looking up a song book by the Carter Family.

Mr Seeger has an easy way introducing the songs, plays them normal and then slows them down which is good for beginners.

So far my favorite is Can't get a letter, which he says is in  open tuning. This is new to me and I was fascinated with how easy it was to play. That's not to say I can now play it as fast as he can. But as he explains, you play it slow and then as you practice, the rest will follow. It's important to get it sounding right before it pick up speed.

There are a lot more songs and is a real learning experience hearing the music played on various guitars.

So all you beginners, don't fear this DVD. It will be a long time companion as you get familiar with the guitar.",1387065600,3,862,4.076923076923077
8308798,5,B001HJXK46,"This is a great DVD.  In the folk tradition Mr. Seegar asks the student to listen to the songs, watch him play them, and try to figure out the songs.  Tab is included in case some passages need clarification.  The songs are preformed using vintage instruments so collectors will enjoy seeing these fine pieces.  When teaching a song Mr. Seegar will explain how the melody can be played out of specific chord shapes, which facilitates becoming familiar with the song.  I don't want to rate the instructional level like level one beginner, level two intermediate ....and on and on.  I think this DVD is of interest to players as well as people that just enjoy Old Timey music. What I like is there is not the ""preachy-ness"" that you might find with other instructors.  There is a spirit of sharing this music with the student/viewer.  This is a must have DVD",1229299200,10,856,4.622516556291391
8308799,4,B001HJXK46,"a WONDERFUL 2 DVD set with fascinating songs, fascinating guitars and a very engaging instruction.  This is one of those productions that show the beauty of DVD lessons with slick production and the feeling that the instructor is right there in the living room with you.
Mike's instruction is slow, steady, and shows the hallmarks of man who is a gifted teacher.  The close ups could not be better.  So.........

Why not 5 stars?

THE ONLY NEGATIVE:  How could they do ALL this work, put together all these songs, demo all these wonderful instruments, pull out these terrific American classic songs AND NOT include the lyrics?

How utterly frustrating to have to search elsewhere in order to obtain the lyrics?  This would have been an ultimate and definitive DVD collection for every acoustic guitarist...if not for this blaring oversight.

It appears as if no expense was spared in this production and I cannot even estimate the number of hours needed to put together such an amazing collection of songs.  Why leave out the lyrics of these gems?

ugh.  so very frustrating!  Yet, for each song that you wish to learn, you will need to search online, print out the lyrics, and add to the TAB.  Given the generous volume of songs, this is no small work.",1225497600,10,1253,4.7407407407407405
