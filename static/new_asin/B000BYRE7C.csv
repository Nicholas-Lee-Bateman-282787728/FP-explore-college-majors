8094444,5,B000BYRE7C,Good Movie but not half as good as part one although it does explain a lot and would be a great movie to buy after watching part one.,1284681600,,133,3.7857142857142856
8094445,4,B000BYRE7C,"I can't believe I'm the first to write a review for this. I haven't seen The Gate 2 in years but I remember it being fun and scary,though I'm partial to the first one (1987),but this one (1990) is good too. In this one,the kid with the glasses in the first movie is a few years older and is now an expert on demonology. I've always considered The Gate to be a classic. I didn't know that these movies were so unknown. I guess that makes The Gate a cult classic.",1158364800,21,461,4.076923076923077
