Daniel Byun's snazzy urban romance ""His Concern"" embeds a single man (Jang Hyuk)'s lifestyle as he carefully prepared the first date with a beautiful Cha Hyun Jung met serendipitously on a train during a business trip. Hur Jin Ho makes good on his genre with ""I'm Right Here"", a gentle, poetic story about a husband (Kim Kang Woo) and his terminally ill wife's (Cha Soo Yeon) game of hide-and-seek, with some sci-fi horror elements thrown in. Yu Young Sik's sex comedy ""I'm 33rd Man"" takes things over the top with the hilarious power struggle between a femme fatale (Bae Jong Ok) and a girl next door (Kim Min Sun) who are fighting over a clueless guy (Kim Su Ro), etc.

A Korean DVD has no English navigation, but dialogue subtitles helpfully, and this, probably, somehow diminishes a pleasant effect of traditionally exiting well balanced sex scenes young beautiful bodies naturally and aesthetically performed.

No shooting, no unlimited vampirism, no brutality Korean movies are usually famous for, some bondages fantasies, teen first experiences, sci-fi motives and attractive male/female physics ought to surely sale this work well at the world scale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beautiful-Lie/dp/B000XPXTPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beautiful Lie</a>&nbsp;made it already with much more porno).

8386488,1,B00311JW9A,"This movie made no sense, no impact, nothing!  I thought maybe there would be a cool connection in the storyline, and that something would come together at the end.  The title was intriguing in that it provoked hopes of an interesting storyline, with some  play of actual senses (like the movie ""Perfect Sense""?) interwoven with erotic tales (like the erotic drama series ""Red Shoe Diaries""?)...but no.  Although it tried to be, the movie failed to be ""arty"", ""thought-provoking"" or ""erotic"" in any way.  A total waste of time.",1397692800,,527,4.943181818181818

The other four stories test your patience leaving you feeling cheated for wasting time to see if anything of substance comes from any of them.
