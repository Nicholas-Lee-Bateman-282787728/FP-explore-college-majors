The cinematogrophy and music are strong, while Shayan Munshi in the lead role excels-- probably the biggest surprise of all, the kid can certainly act. I wasn't expecting too much from the film prior to seeing it; it had received some hype at release but was later recommended to me as an example of a new style of Bengali filmmaking and it more than delivered. India is producing some interesting independent cinema but it continues to be overshadowed by its bigger glossier Bollywood cousin. Hopefully films like this will sustain some level of commerciality for the makers and continue to be made. Recommended.",1293235200,,753,4.844961240310077
8401458,5,B003O7I71A,"After cinematography,Avik Mukherjee is bound to be successful even with directing a film and the same can be said of Aniruddha Roychoudhury achieving success as a producer with this film after having nothing else to prove after the stupendous success of his Antaheen. Shayan is a boyish looking hero and so at times as one feels that Arpita looks older than him and even behaves so, it just might seem to be a minus point. Arpita is again seen on the big screen after seven years and she has done a good job as Rani. The songs of Antaheen might seem to be much better to most people in comparison to this film, but the songs of this film are also very nice thanks to the efforts of Prabuddha Banerjee, a first time music director. Most of the songs have been sung by Shaan and one Rabindrasangeet- Sakhi Kahare' has been sung beautifully by Jayati. The lyrics are by Chandril and Anindya of Chandrabindu fame. Dhritiman Chatterjee as Ananda again features in an interesting role as Ananda just like he had an interesting role in Hitlist. Nowadays Rudranil is being seen in a few films directed by directors who do not really make commercial  cinema .As usual, he has a few one liners , but there is some profanity in the film which is very surprising considering that this is an Aniruddha Roychoudhury (He is the producer).The remarkable fact about this film is that this film has been shot with a RED camera in Bengali films for the very first time. This is a new technological development and the advantages are that a few more scenes can be shot and the post production work could be done in Kolkata. Steven Soderbergh's `Che and `Shutter Island' by Martin Scorsese are films which have been made with a RED camera. Dibyendu is excellent as one of the criminals. Arghya Kamal Mitra is the editor of the film.",1277424000,,1811,4.572307692307692
