8601717,4,B00E65Q8EM,"Thank you to the other reviewers for their pearls of wisdom.  I probably would not have spent the money on this DVD without their input.  I'm probably not adding anything new or profound in this review, but rather supporting some of the others' descriptions.  I, for one, am grateful to have this Excellent Sounding, Much Longer document of the 50th tour. The annoyances are so slight, that as far as I'm concerned, they only cause me to remove a star from it's rating.  I still Wholeheartedly  recommend this disc to all Beach Boys fans.  It's certainly better than a DVD-R bootleg.  The performances are great.  The footage is professionally shot and more than adequate.  ""Back Again"" is a worthwhile addition to your Beach Boys collection.  IMPORT NOTE:  Be sure to get a copy that will play in your region.  Mine is region 0 and plays fine here in the USA.",1404172800,2,860,4.66
8601718,4,B00E65Q8EM,"The origins of this DVD seem to be somewhat unclear.  It's either a somewhat poorly produced import, or a pretty well produced bootleg.

Either way, this is the best available visual document of the Beach Boys amazing 50th Anniversary Tour of 2012.  It contains 34 songs, 13 more than the official 50th DVD.

The pros:  You get more songs than the official DVD, including the moving tributes to Dennis and Carl Wilson.  Especially moving, was a shot of Brian Wilson staring at the image of Dennis during ""Forever."" The band plays very well throughout the show.  The audio of the show is great, and probably better than the 50th Anniversary CD.

The cons:  The picture quality leaves a little to be desired.  It's a little pixilated, but to be honest, you kinda get used to it after the first few songs and get lost in the great music.  While this is a complete concert, the Boys play a much shorter set than they played in the US and UK (anywhere from 47-61 songs depending on the show).  With this being a shorter show, they don't go very deep into the catalog, so there's no ""Please Let Me Wonder"" ""Kiss Me Baby"" ""I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"" or ""Wendy.""  Personally, I would've liked to see some of the covers dropped for the superior Brian Wilson compositions.  It's also surprising that Bruce Johnston doesn't get his ""Disney Girls"" spotlight.

I would recommend buying this DVD if you really want a pro shot document of a great and historic tour, as it will likely be the last tour in which Brian Wilson performs with The Beach Boys.  I'm still hoping that one day, we get an official complete concert (hopefully the 61 song show from Wembley Arena).  But, I'm not holding my breath on that.  For now, this DVD is the best we have.",1403222400,2,2453,4.292576419213974
8601719,4,B00E65Q8EM,"THE DVD VISUAL - 3 STARS.....The picture quality is sub-standard as in fuzzy.  Too many distant and far back side angle views.  Worse than that is the big screen videos shown behind The Beach Boys dominate the actual performers throughout. On the first half the band members that are more featured are Mike Love, Bruce Johnston and Jeffrey Foskett.  The 2nd half improves quite a bit by the spirited  singing of Al Jardine - ""Cotton Fields"", ""Then I Kissed Her"" and ""Help Me Rhonda"".  In the whole show not enough screen time for Brian Wilson and David Marks. The encore does have a rousing finish with guests Christopher Cross - ""Kokomo"" and America - ""Barbara Ann"". THE AUDIO - 4 STARS.....Much better midrange then all the recent 50th Anniversary DVDs and Live CD.  Less bass and drums has the Beach Boys sounding good. Two of my favorites right off the bat are ""Surfin' Safari"" and ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"".  This is how they really came off on the 2012 tour when the group was clicking. A separate CD release is a quick fix for fans who don't want to get a little sea sick.  CONLUSION.....As a DVD 3.5 STARS.  I added a 1/2 STAR being longtime fan.  98 minute running time plus 35 songs makes this concert more complete i.e. - ""When I Grow Up"", ""Surfin' U.S.A."" than the 2012 Arizona DVD.  The production for short attention spans of 1 to 3 seconds however  pales in comparison to the quality of ""2012 Live Concert"".",1402012800,,1424,4.51953125
8601720,3,B00E65Q8EM,"I ordered this DVD instead of the ""official"" reunion tour DVD because of the criticisms of the latter: too few songs, too much ""sweetening"" after the actual performance. The good news is that this disc improves over both of these issues. The audio is great (even multi-channel) and the performances sound very good, but not ""too"" good. It's very enjoyable to watch and that's probably good enough.

The bad news is that this smacks of being a rather odd bootleg. All but one song come from a concert in Japan which has Japanese subtitles as songs are introduced, and the video is low resolution (i.e. below DVD resolution), noisy, and suffers from terrible MPEG compression artifacts. It clearly was ""produced"" and intended to be viewed by an audience; but it simply isn't up to professional standards.",1398816000,5,802,4.897058823529412
