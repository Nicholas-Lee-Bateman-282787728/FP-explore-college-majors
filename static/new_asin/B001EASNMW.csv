3548606,4,B001EASNMW,"We meet Joe Scot after a wild night of sex and drugs, a successful actor who doesn't yet know he's on the cusp of a downhill slide---thanks largely to his self-indulgent,narcissistic lifestyle. His housekeeper, a no-nonsense woman who has put up with his foibles apparently for years, chews him out tiredly; ""You're a disgrace to white folks,"" she growls at him one morning, walking past his still-crashed-out naked form as she cruises around picking up the house. He doesn't argue with her much; he just doesn't really pay attention. Gratification is his sole motivator. Faced with the possibility that Ophelia (Eve), the housekeeper, might really quit, he fixes the problem by adding substantially to her wages. In his mind, money can mend anything. Until he receives a phone call from home - England - informing him that his childhood best friend has died unexpectedly.

Joe's life is shown, not so much in the foreground, although we are given a pretty concise picture of how far he's come and how far he's fallen; most of the film is told in a time before,in his extreme youth, when adolescence wiped away innocence and the path he chose in life was made for him. His teen years - played well by Harry Eden - seem idyllic, though somewhat impoverished; he and his best friend Boots are shown doing what boys do, and Joe is shown living a pleasant enough life with his mother and younger sister in a ramshackle beach house on the coast. Joe's hormones kick in before his best friend's, however, and the randy next-door neighbour lady, bored by being left alone all day when her husband goes to work, takes full advantage of the good-looking boy nearby. Joe is just starting to learn about adulthood when tragedy rips apart the little beach community where he lives, and he can't deal with it. He runs away.

Thirty years later, his world comes full circle with the tragedy of his friend's death, and Joe is forced to see himself for the first time, through reflection of his past. He doesn't like what he sees, and the final part of the movie is his attempts to make sense of what his life has been.

Another quiet, introspective movie, with excellent performances from all the principles, and especially from Daniel Craig, who co-produced it. Going from viewing him as 007 to the undisciplined-but-vulnerable roue in this film was a stretch; but Mr Craig accounted for himself admirably.",1228348800,,2392,4.786924939467313
3548607,4,B001EASNMW,"Some reviewers pointed out that not much happens in this film, which is true.  But it's a quiet, touching story that looks back at what happened in Joe Scott's youth, which partly explains how he became the washed up, junkie Hollywood has-been that we see in the first part of the film.  The flashback story is compelling & well-acted by the young actors, especially Harry Eden who plays the younger Joe.  The music is great, with the Roxy Music song providing a fitting backdrop for the story of loss - of innocence, youth, & love.

Daniel Craig shows that he can be a fine nuanced actor as well as the suave, killing machine he portrays as James Bond.  There is a part at the end which made me wonder.  When the adult Ruth bursts into tears after reading Joe's note, was it because she had been in love with Joe all along, or because it took her back to her youth?",1228089600,6,866,4.3478260869565215
3548608,4,B001EASNMW,"Films of reflection are too few and often they resort to tales of climbing to a summit only to gaze back at the shadows never cast in the greedy race for the top and end in tragedy.  FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL  suggests, by its title, that the story may be different, that there may be some redemption at the core of an abusive life.

Writer/director Baillie Walsh sets his story in opening frames of intense sexual, drug accompanied debauchery.  But as the credits fade, the lead character Joe Scott (Daniel Craig) faces a morning of hung over reality. A wealthy Hollywood star whose lifestyle has hastened his aging, Joe is 'managed' by the stern Ophelia (Eve) who is tiring of Joe's wasted lifestyle. Her warnings, as well as Joe's agent's confrontation that Joe is too old looking for a new screenplay, is compounded by a telephone call that Joe's boyhood friend Boots (Max Deacon) has suddenly died, leaving Joe's old first girlfriend Ruth (Claire Forlani) an early widow.  Depressed and drunk Joe walks his beach and reflects on his youth. The 'flashback' tales us to Joe's teenage years (the young Joe is Harry Eden) with Boots as his closest friend and Ruth (Felicity Jones), the girl Joe craves. But hormones rule and Joe is an easy prey for his married next door neighbor: during one of their trysts a tragedy occurs that results in Joe's fleeing home for the 'successful' yet empty life he finds in Hollywood.

At the request of Joe's mother (Olivia Williams) he flies back to England where he is forced to confront the early damage he caused in the lives of his family and friends.  Daniel Craig and Harry Eden are excellent in their mirrored roles of  the young and the older Joe.  In fact there is not a weak member of this fine British cast.  Though the story takes place in England  the film was shot in South Africa (cinematographer  John Mathieson) and the rickety beach houses on the small bay where Boots and Joe spend their time is picturesque and adds the right sense of isolation to the story.  At 114 minutes the film goes on a bit too long with areas for editing a bit too obvious. But the overall effect of FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL is a satisfying journey through a memory that holds a light to the incidents of youth that can alter too many lives if not mended.

3548609,5,B001EASNMW,"There is a shot in ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" where Daniel Crag is coming down the stairs in the elegant sterility of his Malibu beach house where he stands momentarily in front of a famous photography of himself from Sam Taylor-Wood's Crying Men series. The portrait is so arresting, real tears sparkle in the ravaged eyes of Mr. Craig as he tires to shield his face from the camera. This juxtaposition of the portrait with the manic cut off and out of control movie star, Joe Scott, whom he is playing, says volumes about the film and its theme as well as something about its gifted star.

Director-writer Baillie Walsh has made a gem of a small character driven film that is both deeply meaningful to him and moving to the viewer. Kudos to him for bringing this his vision to the screen and to producer Craig for lending his star clout, which got this film  made.

John Matheison's cinematography is lush and richly fills the screen,. The score by Richard Hartley informs the scenes without overwhelming them. And the editing by Sturan Clay is well done and seamless.

Wonderful performances are turned in by the entire cast with stand outs by Olivia William, Ophelia Franklin (brilliantly low key performance) and felicity Jones.  Yet with a plethora of wonders in this film, great screenplay, perfect score with fine song choices and lush cinematography the heart and soul of this story belongs to two men.

Harry Eden and Daniel Craig who play the role of young and middle-aged Joe. Mr. Eden is not only a perfect physical choice to play a younger version of Daniel Craig but he has an amazingly open and stunning talent that matches his older costar. When he is on the screen you can look at nothing else. He knows how to project the inner feelings of the character straight out though his laser eyes and into the soul of the camera. A young star on the rise indeed and one can only hope that he will continue in the film business.

Daniel Craig again brings his unique talents as an actor to the table as the fading film star whom ""Millions of women want"" yet who is a lost golden boy sliding into the oblivion of drugs and denial. His appearance in small films such as this after his international success in ""Casino Royale"" shows that he is about the work and substance and we can cheer him for it. He is the best actor of his generation, and one of such a range that it leaves one to wonder what will he do next. Behind the most famous blue eyes in film there is such an amazing creature that embodies every emotion from molten rage to the softest tenderest heart. It is our luck and his blessing that he is in the right business and has the talent and courage to let it all out on the screen.",1226016000,31,2700,4.464503042596349
3548610,5,B001EASNMW,"When all around seems to fall very short, there evolves a nostalgia from the depths of blockbuster lack-lustre. Daniel Craig surprises you with an edgy hark back to the style which suits him so well and, not so surprisingly, afforded him the darker 007 he performs. If you're a Brit from the 70's, then this will sadden you as it brings home just what we had then. At the same time it will also light a old flame of those days, which you may have missed!

Attention to detail here makes this a pleasure to watch and with a soundtrack to match, although the soundtrack could have been deeper in volume, rather than reflection. Some nudity and adult scenes, necessary for the context of the plot, which don't offend.

A great Sunday afternoon watch and one to recommend.",1224633600,8,768,4.557971014492754

3548628,5,B001EASNMW,"When I was first introduced to this film , I was still half asleep . It came on very late one night and I just so happened to catch the 'ROXY MUSIC' scene . I rolled out of bed and wrote down the name of the movie ( at that hour I was not going to remember a name like that )-- Instead of searching for it 'ON DEMAND' - I went ahead and just purchased from AMAZON . -- What a great story !!! This really took me back and I now can't stop thinking about that one certain girl , whom I used to hang with in her room -- just drinking and playing cool tunes all night--- and yes-- she even would dress me up like a rock god with eye make-up and all . I haven't heard from her in over 27 years . We both went our separate ways ( on great terms ) . I hope that she has either watched this film , or , is going to one day . (I do not do the facebook thing but my daughters do . I had them try to search for her to no avail. Ya see--- that is one thing that I know about her and how cool she still is --- she's not on facebook )!!Anyway-------- Great Film !! Great Soundtrack !! This is not for kids . They won't get it .

3548629,2,B001EASNMW,"It wasn't that great.  Since Michael Savage, on one of his radio shows, said he enjoyed it, I thought I would too, but didn't happen.  Right now I can't even remember what the plot even was.",1385078400,,190,4.25
3548630,3,B001EASNMW,"Everyone in the cast does a stellar job in their parts in this ""coming to and realizing what life is about"" movie, and the photography is wonderful, but the story itself feels, somehow, unfinished to me.

We see Daniel Craig's character at the messy end of his Hollywood career find out his childhood best friend is dead, catapulting him and us into recollections of a summer in what must be 1973 if I remember the music scene right. I was there when Jean Genie was charting and can state that If There Is Something wasn't actually contemporary with it but from a couple of years before Alladin Sane; for a contemporary RM and Bowie track you need Ziggy, because Virginia Plain charted at the same time Starman did. Ah, youth.

The young DC is a monumentally good acting job and worth the cost to see, along with the famous ""When You Were Young"" lipsynch in which the reasons why the 70s were *not* horrible are obvious.

But the stories only link in the grossest sense. We don't get to see the most interesting part of DC's past (although we do get to see the most formative experience of it) and I'm afraid the ending is weak and unbelievable.

I wanted to four star the movie, but I feel so strongly that the real story lay in the part in between the flashback and the events in the first scene that I can't when I consider the rather obvious and clumsy ending.

Also, the opening credits are accompanied by the most awful song, a heavy-handed ""life lesson"" thing from the same family as ""Cat's in the Cradle"" (only not as solid) that made me fast forward after sticking out the first minute. Truly epic levels of bad. Then it is replayed a few minutes into the movie. Argh!

Worth seeing, but not rewatching I think. It might have been more gripping as a mini series, where the time to develop the various stories of the 70s characters could have been taken.

All in my opinion of course.",1378944000,2,1892,4.4508670520231215
3548631,5,B001EASNMW,"I've noticed that people are really polarized in their opinions on this film. As someone who has spent the first half of his life making one bad decision after another, I loved this movie. It shows that there is redemption for some. The movie ends where the second half of my life began...always being in the right place at the right time and making good decisions instead of the other way around. I can relate on so many levels that I have to give it 5 stars.

Daniel Craig is superb in the role and the countryside of his youth is breathtakingly moody and beautiful.",1376438400,,568,4.40952380952381
3548632,2,B001EASNMW,"I love this film. I saw it several years ago and wanted to see it again so I ordered a stream. It's gorgeously shot, has interesting characters and killer soundtrack. The only problem is that the time line doesn't make sense if you do the math, but, whatever, the spirit and the story is there.

The picture was OK, not brilliant, but not terrible. The audio synch was off the entire time. I restarted it, backed it up, tried everything I could think of, but couldn't get it lined up at all - not even when I first started it. Total bummer for  such a great film with an amazing soundtrack. The bad synch greatly degraded my experience.

3548636,5,B001EASNMW,"How this movie slid by in the theaters without acclaim amazes me. This is drama you don't find ordinarily.
You have several themes interwoven: The ""benefits"" of Craigs character as a fading millionaire-actor-with-champagne-mansion-coke-and-blondes is shown to be ""dubious"" in a variety of ways: While his relationship with his non-white housekeeper ""works"" rather than stereotyped mail-it-in-writing; Craig's character (Joe)  gets torn a new ""you-know-what' by his agent in a manner that makes Tarantino seem tame, and his fall from grace is concurrent with the news of the death (SPOILER) of his childhood chum back in England or Scotland or Wales. Joe's debauch is in Hollywood. So he has to travel.

The scenes are shot SO WELL; Instead of the normal sex scene, there is a mirrored hazy effect which keeps sensuality without reducing it to the obvious; his surrender to a suicidal impulse has Joe floating out to sea, his body merging with an emerald shimmering landscape in a great vision. In flashbacks, we learn Joe's pubescent weaknesses and decisions have life-altering consequence beyond fair, unfair, good-guy-gets-the-girl normal Hollywood BS. It's real life; brutality without overt violence. All taking place within that netherworld where puberty enters early adulthood, yet the consequences are anything but childlike.

In a truly artistic manner, in the ending, his later grief (confession?) is explained to the widow of his friend in a manner left to the viewer to determine; which is SO FREAKIN COOL! If this was Tony Kutchner/Spielberg, leading you by the hand, you would be directed how to feel about each character, who's good, who's bad, who's right, who's wrong. None of that commie s*** here. But at the end, there is a sharing of silence, and the inaudible opportunity for the viewer's own voice to be heard rising up in his own head, allows the viewer to understand in a deeper way. I think its done SO BEAUTIFULLY.

Craig has emerged - IMHO - in a manner as Paul Newman did after ""The Hustler"", before which he was regarded as a ""pretty-boy."" Craig's not just 007 anymore, but a real creative force. His acting rivets you into every scene, the women in the film are fantastic, Olivia Williams especially, and Craig was listed as an Exec Producer. I don't know what other stuff Baillee Walsh has done in film, but when i see this director' name in the future, Im gonna jump on it..",1362528000,3,2406,4.992518703241895

3548641,5,B001EASNMW,"It's a pity that great movies like this are only shown on television in the dark hours of the early morning. No, it's not one I'd want kids to watch, and that's probably why it's shifted to the midnight-or-later time slots on Showtime. Still - people should not have to deprive themselves of sleep to see cinematic greatness.

Many people didn't like this film, but it touched me forever in so many ways. Three are most notable. First, I was a high school senior when I watched it for the first time, and the poignancy of ""Flashbacks"" plus that in my own life resonated together. I will always associate it with those bittersweet times and I expect anyone in similar situations - where their life is about to change - will as well. Second, there are actually lessons to be learned in the film about the consequences of choices. The main character, Joe, has everything, but not really. He has made choices, mostly bad, and he must live with them. Third, the movie introduced me to Felicity Jones, who plays the young Ruth. She acts with such power and such feeling that anyone who isn't moved by her can't possibly have a soul. I keep waiting for her to hit it big, but in a way I don't want her to; she belongs to the serious movie world, not the Hollywood crowd.

I thought this movie was fantastic. I've had Roxy Music's ""If There Is Something,"" its pivotal song, on my iPod ever since I saw it. You might fall under the spell of ""Flashbacks,"" too.",1357430400,,1450,4.447368421052632
3548642,3,B001EASNMW,"BUT, CRAIG, by himself, can not carry this movie. The movie is not really bad, but it's not really good either.
Craig plays a successful Hollywood star on the scids (too much BOOZE, DRUGS, and BIMBOS). He is contacted by family telling him of the death of a childhood friend. He returns to his mothers home in England, after being gone for twenty five years, for the funeral. This starts the FLASHBACKS.
His youth is relived through about age fifteen, when he runs away after a neighborhood tragedy. This part (the flashback) is most of the movie. DANIEL CRAIG is in very little of the movie--just the beginning and the end (after returning from the funeral).
Craig is great while he's on. He has a powerful presence. Without him, the movie is just a soap opera.
The soundtrack for this movie is weird. The song that opens the movie is TERRIBLE and the final song (at end of credits) is even worse. It's some gangsta rap (vile language) that is completely out of place. VERY STRANGE.
There are some sex scenes and drug use. Craig (among others) is naked and you get to see his BUTT.

Surely someone has enough intelligence to figure out a way to convey a movie without being so visually pornographic. It is okay for a viewer to use their brain and think instead of just observe.

3548645,4,B001EASNMW,"This movie hits home from the opening scenes where the main character, Joe, an out-of-work and one-time famously rich actor, is engaged in an orgy before being snapped back to reality by his down-to-earth assistant. Joe is the epitome of a person who has the opportunity of a lifetime as an actor, but when the curtains are drawn and its time to pass the mantel he winds up spending his money on hookers and drugs. Even his agent begs him to leave the business.

When Joe learns his best childhood friend dies he spirals into a flashback of his teen years in England. Here we meet his family, friends, and the older woman next door who seduces him. When a tragedy occurs leaving Joe to blame himself, he runs away and becomes a famous actor. Only when he returns for the funeral does he realize how much he missed out on in life.

Reviewer's Note:

I was drawn to this movie because I like Daniel Craig, and not simply because I believe he's the best person to play Bond since Sean Connery. Rather, Daniel Craig has the ability to play anything and leave you to believe he's the person you see he's playing in character. Flashbacks of a Fool came out the same year as Quantum of Solace and did not get a lot of publicity, but neither did his movie Archangel, from the author Robert Harris, and I like Craig best of all in that movie.

Flashbacks of a Fool hits home because I think all of us look back in our life and wonder what we did right and/or wrong, and how would things have turned out if we did something different. My take on this will end that you won't be disappointed for buying this movie.

It shows how ignoring the important things in our lives is impossible; they never go away.  It gives insight into the excess in our society and its natural conclusion.  And it shows how a small shared experience can be intensely meaningful for a lifetime.  Some of the critical reviews said the script was underdeveloped.  In fact, it is just subtly played, so the viewer must do some work to understand why the characters act the way they do.  But that work is well rewarded.  Excellent cast, beautiful scenes and great structure.  An excellent film.",1316995200,3,732,4.792
3548648,2,B001EASNMW,"""Flashback's Of A Fool"" is a morality tale that cheats its audience who are expecting this to be a Daniel Craig film.  It's not.  Mr. Craig merely bookends the film, with newcomer Harry Eden (playing Craig's younger self from earlier in his life) starring in most of the middle part of the film.

The story begins with Craig's character, a has-been actor, completely burnt out by the business and life in general.  With things falling apart all around him and his career at rock bottom, the man reflects on the events of his youth that helped to make him the man he is today.

Flashback to those earlier years with Harry Eden taking over most of the rest of the film, growing up in a small town, falling for a pretty girl who loves to glitter him up like David Bowie, but then loses her by stupidly having an affair with a married woman.  Does he get his comeuppance?  Is the married woman punished?  Do you have to ask?

The morality of this tale is laid on thicker than my grandma's rice pudding.  Some of it is so over the top and outrageous that one will be left shaking their heads, wondering why they sat through it to begin with.  Certainly not to see Daniel Craig, who also shows up at the very end of the movie in order to bookend it nicely.

I will say that the acting, for the most part, is good, and Harry Eden does well with the part he's been given.  But watching Daniel Craig, who is also good, acting wise, in the film (isn't he always?), I kept wanting to see more of him and less of Harry.

So if you see this for sale, or for rent, thinking that you're going to see another great Daniel Craig movie, think again.  You'll clearly feel cheated by the ad campaign that claims he's the star of the movie, which he's not.",1316044800,4,1735,4.279141104294479

3548652,4,B001EASNMW,"I stumbled across this movie one late night
while channel surfing and it was being aired
on Showtime HD. I generally like Daniel Craig
as an actor of decent talent who is always taking
chances in his career, and he is the epitome of a
fit & attractive older man, as his full-on
nude scenes early in this film will attest! (-:
But I had never heard of this film before and decided to
give it a shot since I had caught it early enough to still
be able to keep up with what was going on in the story.
I guess you could consider this a redemption through
reflection story!---Craig's character is a once very
successful actor who has become a Hollywood cliche'.
He bathes in women, drugs & alchol, excess of every kind,
lives off in his remote exclusive Malibu state-of-the-art
condo which is built right into the side of a mountain
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Hip-Hop star Eve is funny
and believable as his outspoken housekeeper who speaks
her mind and puts him in check to his amusement.
She is one of the few people who he actually values
because she pulls no punches with him.
When she announces her desire to seek employment
elsewhere because of Craig's characters out of control
antics, giving her 2 week notice, he begs her to stay
with him and offers to up her salary.
The chemistry between them is one of mutual
understanding, traded wisecracks, and a complete lack
of guile or BS!  (-:
He has a very public falling out with his agent
during a lunch meeting, who tells him that he's
washed up as an actor and nobody in Hollywood will
touch him because of his bad rep.
Then he gets the news from back home in either
Australia (?) or was it in the coastal UK (?)
that his once dear childhood friend has died suddenly
of a heart attack and all of the memories and ghosts
of his past come floating back to the surface.
Emotionally distraught over his friends' passing
(you get a sense that they had a lot of unresolved
issues between them), and burned out from his life
of Hollywood excess, he wanders out (fully clothed)
into the deep and choppy Pacific, not really caring
if he comes back or not, a floats & reflects on his
life's journey so far.....

Without going further into the story because
I want you all to check it out for yourself,
it suffices to say that this movie is much better
than alot of reviewers have given it credit for.
Though I wouldn't call it a brilliant or great film,
it's by no means tripe or a bad film at all!
It's entertaining, decently-written, has poignant
moments, very sexually charged moments, tragic moments
and ultimately redeeming moments!
It's about coming of age, making mistakes, doing some good,
some bad, having fate intercede, getting lost and then
found again just when you thought it was over & done!
That is life in a nutshell, no?? (-:
Give this movie a try and I'll bet you'll like it.
It's one of those sleepers in a great actor's career
which was ignored when it came out, but which will be
rediscovered in later years by fans who like to go
back and experience the artist's evolution.

The film is book-ended by Daniel Craig as an adult movie star, a bit faded and past his prime, wallowing in beautiful women and drugs (yeah, I know. But it isn't fulfilling)

He reflects back on his teen years growing up in a seaside Australian community.  His first love is somewhat interrupted by the attentions of an older woman, who cannot resist his charms.  What's a horny young guy to do? But least this sound like a teen comedy, it's not. It's a serious coming-of-age story with a touching and convincing performance by Harry Eden.  There are consequences to his involvement with an older woman. And the director/writer of this tale handles it well.

Though it won't make the same kind of money, this film was way better than ""The Invasion,"" a big-budget flick that Mr. Craig did with Nicole Kidman.  He obviously wanted to give this film and the director a push and graciously lends his name and talent to the project, allowing the lion's share of the film to be carried by Mr. Eden. But his scenes with his housekeeper and a stereotyped Hollywood agent and more stereotyped young turk director are nuanced and reveal his character's inner torment.

Here, he portrays an actor leading a self-indulgent and privileged life, though not getting the parts he once did... but still with plenty of money, so he's not down-and-out. Yet,there's a huge piece missing in his life... the piece ... and the ""peace"" that would allow him contentment.

This movie, in exquisite flashback, shows how a single event, in a young person's life... during those all-important formative years, has the power to shape and mold the fiber of one's entire being... a ""gift"" to be carried along into adulthood... and how confronting the past is the first all-important step to the un-doing of its crippling impact.

Daniel Craig's fierce performance... though not in the ""007""-vein, still merits accolades for its bare-bones honesty, and here, perhaps not as ever before, those haunting blue eyes of his help us understand the impact of childhood tragedy.

The film as a whole wasn't bad, wasn't really boring, had decent casting and a few magnificent locations.  I am having a ""lust affair"" (mentally only) with Mr. Craig, so that would usually garner a few extra brownie points for a film, but not in this case.  I guess, simply said, I was disappointed.

I do have to make one thing absolutely clear... Mr. Craig has a World Class Butt and the scene where he gets out of bed and walks away from the camera towards the bath room is most flattering to his tight physique.  I would have really enjoyed the scene where he walks back to bed, but alas, it was non-existant.

Then Joe gets a phone call from his mother in England: his best childhood friend has suddenly died. The story then flashes back 25 years to the teenage Joe (Harry Eden) and the summer of his sexual awakening in his idyllic seaside-resort home town. Filmed in lovely, rich colors by cinematographer John Matheson and filled with interesting characters, this middle section ends with an appalling tragedy that explains both Joe's flight from his home town and his later excesses of behavior. However, the middle-aged Joe and the Hollywood types surrounding him are totally unappealing. The film's final sequence, showing Joe's return home after decades away, blessedly manages to avoid sentimentality, but also avoids being much of anything else. In addition to that, the film has one of the worst, most badly sung theme songs in cinematic history. ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" is worth seeing for its middle section and Matheson's photography.

3548661,3,B001EASNMW,"There are a fair number of things to admire about FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL, although I must say right here and now that the title is NOT one of them!  I cannot believe that anyone thought this would make an enticing title in any way, shape or form.

It tells the story of Joe Scot (Daniel Craig), a very successful film star who has fallen into a life of decadence, drug-use and debauchery.  He lives in a gorgeous house on the sea somewhere and appears to have it all.  Yet he is depressed, miserable, stoned constantly and apparently has become something of a persona non grata in the film industry.  (And most critically, he's just received word from his mother that his old childhood friend ""Boots"" has just died suddenly.) At a meeting with his agent and a very ""artsy"" director, he behaves a little poorly and his agent is so enraged the informs Scot that no one wants to work with him because he's getting old and he's so unreliable and unpleasant.  And his agent fires him on the spot.

Scot sinks deeper into despair about himself, and during a low, contemplative moment, he has one very long flashback about a few key days in his life when he was around 16 or 17 years old.

During this brief time in his youth, Scot has his earliest sexual experiences (with an inappropriate partner), takes a strong interest in a fiery, intelligent and beautiful girl that he's known for years, and he experiences a horrific tragedy that will forever change his life.  We'll also get an idea of why 25 years later, hearing of his friend's death would send him into depression.

Harry Eden, who played Artful Dodger in the most recent remake of OLIVER TWIST, is the young Joe.  He's certainly handsome enough to believe that women all around him would be drawn to him, and he is relatively convincing as a young Daniel Craig.

Olivia Williams has the thankless role of Joe's mother, who spends virtually every scene of the movie in the kitchen of the modest home, making food.  Jodhi May is the sexy next-door neighbor...a woman clearly bored by her life as a housewife and mother.  Felicity Jones plays Ruth, the girl with whom Joe becomes enamored during one evening, as the two enjoy a rather odd but sweet ""first date"" at Ruth's house.

For a huge chunk of the movie, the character of Joe Scot, whether young or old, is VERY unlikable and unsympathetic.  Craig mostly has to play Scot as a man who feels entitled to whatever he wants, but nothing he wants (and gets) actually makes him feel better or behave better.  Eden plays the young Scot as a bit of a mopey teen.  This may be realistic, but it doesn't make it entertaining.  You just want to SMACK this character!

It isn't until the wonderful night Joe shares with Ruth that we begin to see a softening of the character.  Felicity Jones has been given a character of a teenage girl who is clearly mature beyond her years, and not interested in just any boy.  She wants to be moved and challenged.  AND she dearly loves David Bowie and Roxy Music...so spends lot of time in her house listening to their music.  During one odd but touching moment (the moment that Joe really SEES Ruth as the unique and desirable person she is), she dances and lip-synchs to Bryan Ferry.  It's one of those moments when we see how a person can suddenly become SO attractive to another.  My interest in the film (which was now halfway done) finally picked up as I realized I actually had some characters care about finally.

Things don't go as well as we'd hope, and soon  Joe's life takes a dramatic and unhappy turn.  So when Daniel Craig's version of Joe decides to return to his hometown for his friend's funeral, a lot of old feelings well up.  And we finally see Craig showing his acting chops.  He is actually remarkably effective in his final scenes.  Claire Forlani appears in a couple of very touching scenes as well (I won't say more about her character).  And Emilia Fox does a great job playing Joe's younger sister, who we first met as a little girl but is now a grown woman who is totally unimpressed by her brother's movie star status, and is the perfect person to cut Joe down to size when he needs it.

Much of the dialogue of this movie is clunky, particularly early on.  The scene where Craig meets with his agent is just full of ""you'll never work in this town again"" clich.  The poor dialogue didn't help make it easier to warm up to these characters.  To be quite honest, I almost didn't bother to finish the film.  But FINALLY it managed to find its groove, and by the time the final scene came along, I was fairly interested and invested in the characters.

So the movie offers modest pleasures, particularly if you'd like to see Daniel Craig playing something a little more down-to-earth.  A number of nice performances, some lovely scenery, and some genuinely moving scenes.  It's still a bit clunky, and I spent much of the time wondering how anyone even pulled together funding to get this film made...but you might find it worth a look.  I give it a very modest recommendation.",1242950400,3,5038,4.527654867256637

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Movie star burns out
2. His childhood friend dies
3. His life flashes before our eyes
4. He goes home
5. The end

Basically a very shallow film about a movie star (Daniel Craig) whose career is sunk due to his life of excess. You know it's the end when even his agent dumps his sorry, sodden azz.  (Speaking of which, the movie opens with some very nice footage of said bit of anatomy, which may be the only reason to rent this otherwise depressing movie)

Already having a bad day, he is thrown for a loop when he gets a call saying that his best friend from childhood has passed on, and he decides to drown his sorrows in the drink. (He hasn't been in contact with the guy for decades, and didn't treat him that well even when they were hanging out, so I guess all this must be fueled by guilt.)

Through lengthy flashbacks, we learn of his tumultuous teenage years in the `70s, wearing polyester, eye shadow and bell bottoms, dancing to Roxy Music with the hot chick in town, and his relationship with the woman next door.  He becomes involved in a situation that leads to a tragic accident, said accident being unlikely, unbelievable and totally preposterous, but it sure enough put an end to his childhood in a hurry.

Back in the present, he returns home to face his family and former friends.

Basically boring, except for some soft-core footage, a few snappy comebacks by Craig's character's personal assistant (Eve) and a movie stealing performance by a little old lady named Mrs. Rogers (Miriam Karlin, a British actress who was awarded an OBE in 1975).  You should also note that Craig only appears in half of the movie, the talented young actor Harry Eden playing the teenaged version of Craig's character for the middle section.

Recommended for devoted Daniel Craig fans.

3548665,2,B001EASNMW,"This movie is not without its merits as a piece of filmmaking, but let me warn you straight up that if you are interested in this movie solely because Daniel Craig is in it, you will most likely be very disappointed.  I would very much like to sit down with Mr. Craig and plumb his reasons for accepting this role, because though he is billed as the star, his role is actually very small.  Framed as an extended flashback by his teenage self, Mr. Craig as the adult version of his character has only a few brief scenes that bookend the beginning and the end.  His screen time is actually so brief that it barely befits his current stature as a major screen star.  Mr. Craig gives it his all, as usual, but he doesn't have much to work with here.  Perhaps his turn as a dissolute Hollywood mega star is meant as a wry poke in the eye to the massive international stardom the Bond franchise has brought him.  Pre-Bond, Mr. Craig was known in more limited circles as an indie darling in small, dark British films such as this one.  Maybe his appearance here is this versatile and nuanced actor's way of mocking himself for 'selling out' to Hollywood, now that he has achieved fame and fortune after so many journeyman years in small films.

As the film opens, we are treated to a snapshot of movie star Joe Scott's typical lifestyle:  a drug-fueled orgy in his stunning but sterile bachelor pad followed by the harsh bright light of the the morning after.  For all his money, Joe leads a lonely existence between the parties; a visit from his drug dealer is a highlight of his morning.  Joe employs a mouthy Girl Friday, played by Eve, who is his housekeeper, his accountant and his conscience all in one, as she remonstrates with him after another wrecked night of debauchery.  Joe's hard partying ways are taking a toll on his looks (though between you and me, Mr. Craig looks as fine as ever), and his employability.  Directly after losing a job, Joe gets a call from home that his boyhood friend has died suddenly.  A despondent Joe walks into the ocean, ostensibly to commit suicide, and while floating in the water, flashes back to events during one summer of his adolescence that would change his life forever.  The film has some beautiful cinematography and successfully re-creates an English seaside town in the 1970s, but the viewer has the sense of a bait and switch being pulled, now that the story is going in a completely unexpected direction.  Echoes of ""Stand by Me"" and ""Summer of '42"" abound, as the teenage Joe does typical teenage things with his buddies, and gets initiated into manhood by a married neighbor who is a friend of his mother's.  Joe is having a pretty good summer--until a tragedy occurs which casts a shadow over his life, and goes some way toward explaining why the adult Joe is such a mess.

The actors playing the teens do good work, notwithstanding that teenage Joe bears no resemblance to Craig's distinctively craggy features. Admittedly, no one else looks like Dan, so they have done the best they can. Jodhi May (Last of the Mohicans) as the seductive neighbor offers a standout performance, and she is nearly unrecognizable.  It's all very pretty, nostalgic, soft-focus pastiche, but the narrative is weak for a couple of reasons:  the flashback sequence includes incidents and conversations which teenage Joe was not present for and therefore could not possibly remember, if these are supposed to be his memories that we are watching--that is lazy storytelling.  Another glaring and aggravating flaw is the period itself.  The wardrobe and music references date it in the early-to-mid 1970s, which mean that Mr. Craig as the adult Joe would have to be in his mid-50s to have danced to Roxy Music records during his high school years.  Mr. Craig was born in 1968, which would put him just barely out of nappies, or perhaps in kindergarten, when the Bryan Ferry song that's played during a crucial scene would've been popular.  I can't believe this glaring inconsistency didn't seem to be as problematic for the filmmakers (and Mr. Craig) as it was to me.  Mr. Craig is two years younger than I; he would have been far more likely to dance to Dexy's Midnight Runners or INXS when he was in high school.  I'm just sayin'.

For those who felt that Mr. Craig's naked torture scene in ""Casino Royale"" was too regrettably brief, the opening scene of this film should make you happy.  Mr. Craig's incredibly buff, incredibly luscious physique is no trick of CGI--he is, in a word, glorious.  If you're a Craig fan, any helping of him, however brief, is not to be missed.  But should you buy this?  Maybe investing in ""Quantum of Solace"" would be a better bet.  And really, this title couldn't be more lame.  If they titled it ""Reflections on Dan's Buns"" they'd sure sell a heckava lot more copies!

I give this film 2 stars--one for each of Cheeky Dan's attributes.",1234915200,5,4900,4.659302325581395

The performances in this film are rather good; especially the leads, and there is some great cinematography.  Sadly; however, though the acting is fine, I felt uninvolved and disinterested in the characters.  As other reviewers have stated, the film is a bit disconnected and often disjointed.  This is in evidence primarily with regards to the friendship involving Joe and Boots.  Their relationship never leads to the feeling that they were very close.  Ultimately the movie never compelled or inspired me to care.  This is a middle of the road movie that is really not that fun to watch.

3548667,4,B001EASNMW,"Having just had a threesome with two luscious naked babes in the silk sheets of his bedroom (itself the size of Terminal 5) and having just stuffed up his hooter enough pharmaceuticals to paralyse the entire population of Vancouver, Daniel Craig then stands on the balcony of his multi-million-dollar Malibu home overlooking the Pacific ocean in his linen strides - and sighs - where did it all go wrong???

Some people think it started here...because some folks have asked how this film even got made. Reactions to ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" have been very mixed - some calling it utter tosh - while others have been deeply moved by it and awarded it 5 stars. Personally I enjoyed the movie immensely - not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination - but there was an awful lot in ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" to enjoy and nice to see a varied troupe of young and more experienced actors given real meat to work with - and rising to it - all are uniformly excellent.

Freed of the acting constraints of Bond, Craig is a revelation - fantastically different as the fading Joe Scott. All twitchy, needy and in his late 40's, Joe is a one-time famous movie star who has lived his life to excess at all times and is now growing ever more dependent on his bored black maid and packets of powder from visiting white 'friends'. Joe Scott is all egomania and awash in the nasty distant side of himself that goes with addiction and endlessly appeased self-praise.

Then he receives some news from his ageing mum (Olivia Williams) by long distance phonecall. His young adolescent past in beach-front 1970's England - especially his relationship with a compliant mate called Boots (understatedly played by Max Deacon) are now coming back to haunt him. As well as Boots - whom he left in the dust so that young Joe Scott (played by a superb and visually similar Harry Eden) could seek fame and fortune in the USA - there are also intense feelings for his first true love - Ruth Davies - played by the lovely Felicity Jones - and how he eventually treated Ruth...

Other actors include Mark Strong who has a great piece as Joe's now impatient Hollywood agent - and the actress Eve - who plays her character Ophelia Franklin (Joe's ever-supportive but wary maid) convincingly well. Jodhi May is also superb as Evelyn, a friend to Joe's mum who is always in the Scott family kitchen with her lustful married eye on the sexually nave, but handsome and lithe young Joe.

There's also a particularly brilliant sequence - which many have already commented on - where young Ruth and Young Joe are dancing to Roxy Music's ""If There Is Something"" from the band's 1972 debut album ""Roxy Music"" (lyrics above). As young Ruth places the needle into track three of Side One, we see the pink-rim palm-tree Island label of an original vinyl LP pressing...and off she goes. She sings the words and mimes the movements of Bryan Ferry. Young Joe follows suit - falling hopelessly in love - under her magic spell - and loosing him self to a moment that will haunt him for the rest of his makeup bound life. Although its just them dancing to a Seventies song - the lyrics and the music make it intensely moving - and nostalgic too - and all of it imbibed with men's inexplicable love for Bowie and Roxy Music and Mott The Hoople and T.Rex and...well, any music from that magical period really.

The story then goes on to teenage lust, family squabbling and a terrible tragedy that wasn't avoided by a busy-body old neighbour who's shouting wasn't heard (played to perfection by Miriam Karlin)...

Although the 'flashback' sequence is very long - I thought it was brilliantly realized - especially young Joe's awakening to the effect he has on the opposite sex - which of course is carried on into his film star years as the older Daniel Craig character. And although he's a bit of an obnoxious git really and therefore difficult to like - to his credit - Craig plays his character true all the way - whether he grows or not - he is what he is. There's also a very satisfactory reconciliation scene at the end of the movie with an emotionally blocked but still very beautiful Claire Forlani...the grown-up Ruth.

Written and Directed by Baillie Walsh, the cinematography also features lovely South Australian locations dubbing as coastal Britain and original music by Richard Hartley in between the 70's tunes.

'Growing up' has been done before so many times, so it's hard to get a new or even fresh angle on it, but it was cleverly realised and brilliantly acted in ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"". And while some have complained that Craig is only on screen for 30 minutes - man what a great half hour it is - a lot better than the half-assed crap that was the last Bond outing where I felt his heart wasn't in it at all. Well on this film his acting is. And as the brilliant and evocative ""It Ain't Easy"" by David Bowie played out the credits, I was compelled, moved and grinning from ear to ear.

Put ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" high on your rental/to buy list - highly recommended.",1233187200,,5036,4.5793562708102105
3548668,4,B001EASNMW,"I recently saw Daniel Craig on ""The Daily Show,"" where he was promoting his new Hollywood movie ""Defiance.""  He said was nervous about coming on the show and being interviewed by Mr. Stewart, so I began to imagine Mr. Craig with more depth than I had at first.  Therefore I ordered ""Flashbacks of a Fool,"" hoping for more depth, and I was not disappointed.

Most of the reviews have pointed out the shortcomings of film, i.e., that it was slow getting started, it failed to develop the characters, and the pacing was uneven.  I won't disagree.

But right now I'm in the mood to talk about good things, and there are plenty of positive and curious things to discuss.  First is the wonderfuly scenery.  The beach scenes (malibu, and South Africa) dominated this movie and they were spectacular.  The tiny community in which the scenes of adolescene are filmed brought some character and warmth to the movie at a time when they were desperately needed.  And the cinematography was very creative, and definitely met the challenges of the wonderful landscapes and seascapes.

Some of the lack of character development I thought was reasonable given the perspective was that of a young, and middle aged man.  Sometimes I think American audiences want everything to end perfectly with a complete personality change taking place overnight.  Dickens, who first brought this concept to the popular vernacular with ""A Christmas Carol,"" was British.  Yet this modern British tale avoids that unreality.  The main character I think comes to understand his weaknesses enough to acknowledge himself as a ""fool."" But he doesn't mysteriously transform a la Scrooge.

At the cemetary scene with the young widow Ruth (played by the marvelous Claire Forlani) on whom he once had a crush (one of the many things he tragically lost), he briefly acknowledges the failures of his past.  But he is still unable to give them voice, or confront them.  In an odd cinematic embodiment, the camera, like the main character, is never able to get close to the grownup Ruth.  Claire Forlani remained mysteriously (and literally) distant!  He isn't able to approach her, so neither are we.

Yet he hasn't entirely lost his heart.  His family is obviously now living in a home he had previously bought for them, and he writes a check out to Ruth so she can escape the debt left by her husband (his former best friend).  But he cannot give it to her himself.  He lets his sister deliver the letter, which we see, without sound, finally releases Ruth's agony of despair.

Yet we are left to wonder what the main character, unlike Scrooge, will do with the rest of his life.  Somehow this is as it should be.

You may or may not enjoy the music most relevant to British teens some thiry or so years ago, or David Bowie and Bryan Ferry fans.  Ironically, I recently added Bryan Ferry's ""Dance with Life (A Brilliant Light)"" from the ""Phenomenon"" soundtrack to my I-pod.",1232928000,3,2930,4.7848605577689245
3548669,4,B001EASNMW,"Nice to see that playing James Bond hasn't ruined Daniel Craig for smaller, more thoughtful films. ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" is definitely the second kind of movie -- a juicily thoughtful, bittersweet look back on an actor's past and present lives. It's a touching small-scale story, although Scott's required return home isn't entirely satisfying.

Joe Scott (Craig) is a Hollywood actor who's sliding downhill -- he has sex with random women in an expensive house, snorts lots of coke, and is considered pathetic by his own PA Ophelia (Eve). His career is starting to go downhill as well, since his appearance is being affected by his personal habits. But then he receives a phone call saying that his old friend Boots has just died.

You guessed it: a trip down memory lane ensues, as Joe thinks back to his youth -- he was best buddies with Boots (Max Deacon), hopelessly longed after Ruth (Felicity Jones), whom he was in love with; and was having a secret affair with Evelyn (Jodhi May), a married woman living next door. But a tragedy propelled Scott out of his hometown and off into Hollywood, and helps fuel his miserable empty life to this day. Can he turn it around, or has his guilt consumed him?

""Flashbacks of a Fool"" has been done before -- the man who has everything money can buy, yet has nothing that makes him happy. Sex, drugs and stardom can't fill the hole in his soul, et cetera and ad nauseam. That, and somehow the ending of the movie feels vaguely tacked on and horribly awkward, despite Craig and Claire Forlani's best efforts.

That said, the bittersweet atmosphere and beautiful English backdrop of the flashbacks is nicely done, and serve as a sharp contrast to the sleek, debauched feel of Joe's Hollywood life (where twittering starlets flit in and out of his bedroom with nary a second glance). Baillie Walsh does a solid enough job through the first 90% of the movie, despite an unravelled ending.

And seeing his youth's halcyon days deteriorate around him gives the entire movie a feeling of painful frailty, as if Joe might crumble with a gust of wind. Everybody makes mistakes, but you can see how such a horrible event in his formative years -- and the guilty associated with an already-guilty act -- could ruin him. And in turn, he corrupted the innocence of everyone around him. Nasty.

Overall Daniel Craig does an excellent job with Joe, using minimalist acting and painfully transparent eyes to good effect -- although he seems a bit uncomfortable with the more sentimental moments. Claire Forlani does what she can with the rather ill-drawn Ruth, Eve has a good small role, and the incredibly underrated Jodhi May is brilliant as the Mrs. Robinson next door.

""Flashbacks of a Fool"" is what it sounds like -- a man haunted by his youthful mistakes, and how he takes steps to deal with them. Imperfect, but the actors make it worth watching.",1231977600,2,2883,4.74251497005988
3548670,3,B001EASNMW,"Cheeky as in ""cute buns.""  Yes, folks, James Bond parades around the first half hour of ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" baring his cheeks like nobody's business.  And for a 40-year-old guy he's lookin' real good.  Just for showing his incredibly hunky body (sorry, no full frontal), I'm giving this flick a better grade than I normally would (see below).

The movie itself is very familiar.  A troubled movie star, Joe Scot (Craig), is described by his sassy personal assistant/cook/housekeeper early on in the film as a ""self-indulgent damn fool"" and ""Captain Wacky.""  Since the movie opens with him making love to two women and snorting cocaine, I would have to agree with her assessment.  After his agent dumps him, Joe has a flashback to his teenage years, which introduces us to his younger self (played by the adorable Harry Eden).  Young Joe has to deal with various relationships with a male best friend, Boots, a girl he seems to be interested in, Ruth, and an older married lady, Evelyn, who wants to play Mrs. Robinson to his Benjamin.  Of course, life gets very complicated for the poor boy, which helps explain to us how he ended up such a mess as an adult.

The performances are terrific: Daniel Craig and Harry Eden are both quite mesmerizing to watch.  And the supporting cast of Eve (as Joe's assistant), Jodhi May (as Evelyn), Olivia Williams (as Joe's mother), Felicity Jones (as Ruth), and Max Deacon (as Boots) are all very good.  Unfortunately, the movie never makes up its mind on what relationship in Joe's life were supposed to care about the most.  At first I thought the film was going to be about his close friendship with Boots, but this is never really explored.  And I was confused by his odd relationship with Ruth, who overreacts in a crucial scene.  Also, I'm still not sure if Joe's mother is in a lesbian relationship with another woman, Peggy, who lives with them, or if Peggy is just a relative of some sort.  By the end of ""Flashbacks of a Fool"", I was left thinking, ""What is the point of this film?""  I liked the present-day scenes with Craig and the past ones with Eden, but none of the drama amounted to all that much by the end.  And who hasn't already seen a movie about a troubled movie star exploring his past in order to get his life back together?  Didn't Meryl Streep already act this role in ""Postcards from the Edge"" (a far better film--go watch it instead).

So, I can't really recommend the film--unless you're a big Daniel Craig fan and want to check out his fine assets.  The acting is wonderful, and I was never bored.  However, the story is one we've seen before, and ultimately it just doesn't amount to very much.  I give ""Flashbacks of a Fool"" a C+--and the + is all about Craig's divine cheekiness.",1231113600,,2751,4.580777096114519
3548671,3,B001EASNMW,"Actor Joe Scott has everything he ever wanted: fame, fortune, Malibu mansion. Now firmly ensconced on the self destructive cycle of sex, drugs and loneliness, in one terrible day he finds his career in the dumps and learns that his best friend, whom he hasn't seen in decades, has unexpectedly died back home in England. Joe returns for his funeral, and the rest of the movie focuses upon his memories of growing up and realizing how he got this way.

It's all been done before, and there's nothing fresh or new in Flashbacks of a Fool. The competent acting and lovely background shots can do little to inject life into it. Even the graphic sex is cold.  In the end, it is left unclear as to what direction Joe will take as he returns to California.

Joe Scott, played by Daniel Craig, is a washed up Hollywood star, who receives a phone call his childhood friend has died. As Scott travels back to his hometown, he flashes back on the event that lead up to the reason he left.

The acting, in my opinion, was phenomenal. There were some who really stood out - Daniel Craig, of course, as well as Eve, who played Scott's personal assistant. There were others like Harry Eden, Olivia Williams, and so many more.

My major problem was the ending. Though realistic, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I really was dissatisfied with it.",1229904000,,698,4.488188976377953

I recognized some vague remnant of a potentially good story, but struggled to follow it.  The acting was adequate, but not remarkable.  After watching a first time, I had my husband sit down with me for a second try.  It didn't get any better.

But before he was Bond, Daniel Craig was a very good actor who had played both leading roles and bit parts over the years. In Flashbacks of a Fool, Craig shows us that yes he can act. A film that I can only assume he made during the break between Bond films to keep himself busy, Flashbacks is not a bad film but an okay film that could have been done better. Possibly if it had better direction or possibly a more fine tuned script. The scenes with Craig are well done, especially the scenes with his maid played by rapper/actress Eve. The problem in this film lies in the flashbacks. They seem poorly written and tend to drag on for far too long. Again I believe that if it had been better written Flashbacks of a Fool could have been a very good film.",1229644800,,873,4.233532934131737
3548677,3,B001EASNMW,"FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL ostensibly begins in my general locale, Malibu, CA. Even the pricey toys of the rich and famous are present - drugs, alcohol, and multiple air-headed bimbos. And, within the film, forty-something actor Joe Scott (Daniel Craig) is being burned out by them all. So much so that he suddenly finds himself on the unemployable ""A"" list. Then a call from Mom breaks the news that his best friend of childhood has suddenly dropped dead and he'd better hurry if he's to make it home to England for the funeral. This prompts an extended and waterlogged flashback to ...

... the 70s some twenty-five years before. Joe, now played by Harry Eden, lives in a beachside bungalow with Mom (Olivia Williams) and sister somewhere on the English coastline. Besides the usual adolescent male antics with his best friend Boots (Max Deacon) - fishing, shooting pool, and masturbating in amusement park funhouses - Joe's chief diversion seem to be hanging with his platonic girlfriend, Ruth (Felicity Jones). Joe has barely kissed Ruth, but, then, there's another teacher for his sexual instruction, which is the next-door married lady, Evelyn (Jodhi May), who's determined to seduce our young hero whenever her hubby isn't around. (Of course, when you're a teenaged hormone hydrant, it doesn't take much. And, lawdy, lawdy, where was a neighbor like Evelyn when I was growing up!?!)

The turning point in Young Joe's life is the explosive and spectacular tragedy that occurs one lazy afternoon when Evelyn and her sex toy are grappling on the sheets. I have to admit, the scriptwriter who thought up the nature of the event deserves an Oscar for imagination. Anyway, Joe leaves for America, never to return until ...

... the end of the film. Here, the chief failure of FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL, i.e. the miscasting of Craig as the older Joe, becomes apparent. His reunion, such as it is, with Ruth (now played by Claire Forlani), who'd grown up to become his best friend's widow, is emotionally unsatisfying to a woeful degree. Or maybe the scriptwriter, resting on the laurels of the earlier on-screen tragedy, just couldn't muster the energy for another go.

As I watched the flashback, my subconscious was screaming that what I was seeing wasn't England. The vegetation and architectural construction were somehow wrong. As the end credits rolled and the filming location was identified as South Africa, I was gratified that my affinity for my adopted spiritual home developed from multiple visits over the years hadn't failed me.",1229644800,,2903,5.290672451193059

Flashbacks is well-made, but I never really felt what I think I was supposed to. Maybe that's my fault, but it still leaves me respecting but not loving this movie, despite its good points.

3548679,4,B001EASNMW,"Mistakes and looking back - every person has them. What if you had made it, though, and only had a cloud full of narcotics to remember it by and a failed life to show for it? In the case of this tale, we watch our main character (played by Craig) show us exactly what might happen when a house of cards is built with crooks and bends and then one has to recall all the mistakes they make.
It is a story of humanity, frail and filled with turmoil, and I liked it. I liked it a lot.

As we all know, looking back is a painful process and Daniel Craig delivers a portrait of that with stunning results. When I sat there and watched it I could take the Six Degrees of Separation and tie it back to me, and that process makes for some rather interesting introspection. To accomplish this sort of feeling there has to be something tying everything together, and the performances delivered were amazing good considering what I had expected. There are many memorable scenes tied to Craig himself as he scratches and claws at the present and the past- sometimes small and easy to overlook and sometimes weighed and hard to stomach because they run parallel to the rest of us - and these scenes make me happy to watch play out because it makes the movie have feeling. Too often movies try to evoke feelings only to fall from the sky like flightless birds but this piece, this presence, spins a beautiful horizon on its loom. Despite the failure addressed it made me happy to watch it, too, and I thought that so many aspects of it were redeemable. Normally I might not have even watched this movie but, by chance, it and I connected and I it and I sat for almost two hours pondering a life that never was. The title, aptly named, coined so many realms in so many ill-gotten worlds.

If the movie looks interesting to you, you should check it out because it has a lot to off. Daniel Craig has become a great actor as of late, noticeably upping his game and becoming a star that shines even brighter. Couple this with some other people that burn brightly as well and you have performances that build on performances until something beautiful arises from ash. As far as myself I would have rented the thing to make sure I liked it first, but I'm glad I picked it up because was touching.

3548680,4,B001EASNMW,"The flashbacks in FLASHBACKS OF A FOOL are the remorseful reminiscences of washed-up, dissipated actor Joe Scot (Daniel Craig).  Unable to really connect with people in a rewarding way, he's become tedious to everyone who's associated with him, and his lack of genuine concern for anyone is returned in full measure.  The death of the beloved childhood friend he hasn't seen in twenty-five years initiates some soul searching, forcing him to collide with the fact of who he is.  Most of the recollections involve his clumsy coming of age, his physically satisfying albeit confusing early romantic entanglements, complicated by his marginalizing this best friend, who was always somewhat clearer in his thinking than Joe was.  There's no PLOT per se in this film, no overarching story.  Instead there's a cohesive emotional line that strings it all together, gently nudging every scene, so it never feels discursive.  A nice surprise was how the film score used iconic glam rock songs -- by David Bowie from his Ziggy period, and some very early Bryan Ferry -- as more than just an easy cliche to establish a time frame.  They served as a means of bridging a gulf between the characters, to establish a ready-made identity, and to express depths of feeling they were unable to express themselves.  It's casually introduced then later artfully alluded to, demonstrating a very subtle craftsmanship in handling emotional complexity.

All of this works in a way that's constantly revelatory, so you're coaxed by your own concern for these people, even people you think you're not going to like, to follow along.  And there's always a nice breeze and a beautiful beach, a bucolic setting in which a boy struggles with his natural desires hampered by his naivete, torn between what he thinks he needs and what he knows is right.  This might sound trite, like something you've seen before, and you probably have.  But this was so gentle in its pacing, it gave you time to connect with its sense of impending tragedy, and therefore transcended its familiarity.  It felt real and natural, nothing strained or forced.  With understated roles requiring the kinds of performances good actors love, it's not a sappy, feel-good, romanticized view of life.  Yet, by the end, life feels good anyway.

It was a completely fulfilling film, and it was all beautifully photographed, to boot.

The opening shot with a maudlin ballad sounds like a made for TV soundtrack from the 1970s. Attempts at ""ironic dialogue"" fall flat. The soundtrack throughout is amateur and sounds like trite 1980s low-budget (except for the opening, which sounds even older).

3548683,5,B001EASNMW,"At the risk of exposing my ignorance, are British films considered ""foreign""?  If not, this one nevertheless has the feel of a foreign film.  And I loved every minute of it.

This movie has an underlying melancholy.  There is something about the lighting and the way it is shot and the music.  It also has charm, and dry humour and wit.  In the recent past, the only movie that I have seen that I find similarly paced is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-Lucia-Rated-Edition/dp/B0004Z32N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and Lucia (Rated Edition)</a>.  There are even the same themes of tragedy and guilt informing one's actions (why is sex always involved?).  And of redemption.

Although Daniel Craig headlines (and does a marvelous job), this was one of those increasingly rare movies where every cast member held his own and was integral to the very satisfying whole.  The entire story of young Ruth and Joe got told in what might have been a total of 10 minutes of them together on screen.  All their passion and youth and allure, attraction, and the sense of something happening - something that could be real and deep and lasting.  And in the 20 seconds the director spent tearing that potential apart, the viewer feels the loss.

Baillie Walsh (writer/director) has found himself a fan.  How can I possibly not be - thanks to him, Daniel Craig is not only the manliest man I (currently) drool over, now he has talent and depth.  And so my obsession is complete...sigh.

3548684,3,B001EASNMW,"""Flashbacks of a Fool"" is an intriguing non-Bond vehicle for Daniel Craig, who plays Joe Scot, a past-his-prime Hollywood star who has backslid into a decadent sex-and-drugs lifestyle.  Rap artist Eve plays his sassy housekeeper, which sounds cliched, though their relationship has an undercurrent of friendship and caring.  One day Joe gets a call from his mother back home in England: Boots, his best friend from childhood, has died suddenly.  This sends Joe into serious flashback mode, as he recalls the fateful summer that led to him leaving home as a teenager.

The movie pushes a lot of the same buttons that ""Atonement"" did, with its themes of guilt, regret and redemption, and like that film, most of it is told in retrospect.  In fact, that's one of the problems with it: there's not enough screen time for Craig, who bookends the story and is in only about one-fourth of the movie.  His character, while not very likable, is nonetheless intriguing, and Craig brings his usual smoldering intensity to the role.  Olivia Williams is fine as Joe's mother, both in flashback and present day, but Harry Eden is a bit of a cipher as young Joe.  He goes through most of his role as though life is a pair of headlights and he's the deer.  The story itself is at times a bit too familiar: for instance, when Evelyn, Joe's insatiable older lover, sends her young daughter out to play so they can tryst, you know exactly what will happen next.  I'm no expert on the British seaside, but the cause of the ensuing tragedy seems a bit preposterous to me and overly dramatic.  The other problem is that, although the story gives some insight into what may have led to Joe becoming who he is, one never really discovers why he squandered his career.  And the last chapter, when Joe returns home, hints at redemption, but feels more like an anticlimax.  The movie is filmed beautifully, sometimes a little too much so, with long shots in soft-focus and golden-hued lighting.  As somber as it is, the film isn't without its moments of sly and even macabre humor, like present-day Joe's drug dealer, who looks and behaves more like an Avon lady.  And, as a warning to those who need it, there are some fairly intense sex scenes.  Would I recommend it?

Mrs. Rogers is played by Miriam Karlin who played a caged German grandmother in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and Catlady in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;back in 1971.  While there are other interesting performances, Karlin pretty much steals the picture in her brief scenes, particularly shouting words of warning to a young girl playing dangerously.  Her crippled toothless persona makes an impression hard to forget.  It is a powerful scene, probably the best in the film.

Of course, there is Daniel Craig who actually stars.  Craig bares all for the picture and plays a superficial, self-centered fading Hollywood star with an intensity that doesn't entirely suit the superficial character Joe Scott.  His pithy dialogue with his housekeeper is great banter.  However, the story fails to make us really care about Joe, until his last act of kindness which is done by leaving a letter rather than with any personal touch.  One wonders what Scot's choices might be as an actor in the future after his ""flashbacks.""

Ophelia Franklin played by Eve has a cameo appearance.  She does a good job of standing up to her boss.  The local dealer is sacrilegiously coded as ""Sister Jean,"" played by Emilia Fox.  Far from a nun, she brings Joe the nose candy he so desires.  It's a nice cameo.  Director Ballie Walsh who is directing his first feature after several documentaries allows the supporting players to bloom for their limited screen time.

About half of the film is in flashback.  Harry Eden who played the Artful Dodger in Roman Polanski's ""Oliver Twist"" plays young Joe Scot.  While the graphic sex scenes titilate, Eden plays Joe as a shy awakening teen who seems more like a callow youth than a budding megastar.  Even the Bowie imitation doesn't quite make the sale.

His mother is played by Olivia Williams.  Williams played in several films I've watched recently including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tara-Road/dp/B000Q677CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tara Road</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001HAISG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (Widescreen Edition)</a>, uncredited as Chaucer's wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale-Special-Edition/dp/B00000F4ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and in one of my all-time least favorite films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mood-Swingers/dp/B00005OCLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mood Swingers</a>.  As Grace Scot, she is caring, bakes cookies with the kids, and seems to give her teenage son space to experience the world as an adult.

Jodhi May plays Evelyn, the married mother whose desire is more prominent than her maternal instincts.  The several seduction scenes with the young Joe Scott are steamy.  Meanwhile, young Joe has a crush on Ruth.  She's well played by Felicity Jones who will play Miranda in a new film version of ""The Tempest.""  The lovely Claire Forlani from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-Joe-Black/dp/0783233477/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet Joe Black</a>&nbsp;plays the grown Ruth lamenting the loss of her husband.

Much of the failure of the film comes from gaps in the writing.  We can't really tell how the boy in the past became the man in the present or what awaits in the future.  The cinematography and direction work well, but there is much that needed to be added to make the characters from the past and present seem unified.  The piece is worth an evening's entertainment.

3548687,4,B001EASNMW,"Flashbacks of a Fool is a totally engrossing film starring Daniel Craig as Joe Scot, a washed up actor addicted to drugs and sex (Advisory: extremely graphic drug and sex scenes featuring Craig and multiple female partners). Scot's career is in the tank due to his excesses, he is in danger of losing all human contact in his life and then suddenly a childhood friend dies causing him to take stock of his life. In an extended flashback sequence, Scot relives his youth as he struggles to understand why he has crashed and burned. The flashback is arresting, depicting Scot's initiation to sex with a married woman, a sweet failed romance and a horrifying personal tragedy that altered his life forever. The film is incredibly erotic, beautifully filmed and edited. The seduction scenes featuring young Harry Eden (Oliver Twist) as the teenaged Scot and an older woman will leave you breathless. Craig delivers a sharp and disturbing performance. This film is arty, hot, emotionally satisifying and will stay in your mind for days. And for anyone who grew up during the age of glam rock in the 70's, the flashback sequence is breathtaking . . . featuring the music of David Bowie and Bryan Ferry in a context that will take your breath away. Highly, highly recommended. Great cameo by Eve as Scot's housekeeper, one of the few genuine people in his world. See this film.",1228608000,,1370,4.809322033898305
3548688,4,B001EASNMW,"While this film is somewhat disjointed it still manages to make you feel something.

At the beginning of the film it's obvious that Joe Scot, portrayed by Daniel Craig, has alot of baggage. When Joe receives a call about the death of a childhood friend, the film takes you back in time in Joe's life to when he was a young teen. Events that happen and mold Joe into the person he has become, unfold in a sense of melancholy and angst that so often accompanies a young man of his age. When a tramatic event unfolds indirectly because of Joe's actions, his life changes abruptly.

This film is filled with interesting characters that sadly we don't seem to get to know well enough. That being said the actors do seem to make the most of their charcters. It's a visually appealing film and doesn't present it's self as your average everyday movie. All in all i found it enjoyable inspite of any short comings it may have.

I would have appreciated more Extras.",1228521600,,957,4.488505747126437
3548689,2,B001EASNMW,"Flashbacks of a Fool tells the story of Joe, a pathetic has-been movie star, beginning, after a very brief introduction illustrating the innocence of childhood, with a very long scene of Joe, two women and a lot of cocaine, followed by a wannabe artsy scene of bacon frying (Joe, this is your brain on drugs). At this point, we do meet the  best character in the film, his no nonsense housekeeper, who gains a pay raise by threatening to quit. He learns of the sudden death of a childhood pal, and eventually decides to go back to Britian for the funeral, to which he is, of course, late. Flashbacks tell of the reasons for his abrupt departure from his home many years before. I never really got the point of this movie except to watch Joe make a mess of his young life, although I could have missed something trying to understand the actors, whose accents were at times incomprehensible to these American ears. This is a sad, miserable movie about accepting the penalties for past behavior, but having no real hope of redemption.",1228435200,2,1031,4.603260869565218
3548690,3,B001EASNMW,"Or a middle-aged fool. And ""fool"" acurately describes the lead character ""Joe Scot"".
When the viewer is first introduced to this character, he seems totally unlikeable and unbelievably sleazy. He's a guy who has been throwing away his career, maybe even his life, with his self-indulgent perversions. (Even his housekeeper is tempted to leave him, he's such a selfish putz.)

Then Joe receives news that a childhood best friend has died. Flashback to Joe's youth, in an English seaside village. We get to see how Joe came to be who he is, and the character becomes slightly more likeable.

There have already been many reviews written about this film, and I won't give spoilers for the ending, but I have to say that by the end of the film, I felt only slightly more sympathy for this character than I did when he first came onscreen.

All in all, this wasn't a bad movie, but--as described on the jewel case--""one man's journey to redemption""?  I didn't see it that way.

Though the entire cast played their roles to perfection, and though the scenery (in the seaside village) was luscious, I just couldn't get into the character enough to completely enjoy the film.",1228435200,,1167,4.757425742574258
