5563749,5,B00B96TGQS,This was very good. Great cast and filming. Just as enjoyable as the first one. I really like that they are making dramatized versions of the actual stories. Totally worth a view.,1359936000,2,179,4.625

5563756,5,B00B96TGQS,This movie is based on true events that happened to a little girl and her family where the girl begins see ghosts the first ghost she sees is very friendly and watches over her and tries to protect her then her mother and aunt begin to see other ghosts most of which are trying to warn them about a darker more unfriendly ghost that is out to harm them. I really enjoy watching this movie and highly recommend it,1508112000,,412,4.227848101265823

5563759,1,B00B96TGQS,"One of the lamest, un-scariest horror movies I've ever seen. The ""scares"" are painfully predictable, the acting is mediocre at best, and the movie is only driven forward because the mom is just totally in denial. Even her HUSBAND who can't see ghosts is all ""yo this is some bad juju."" I really wish I could get my $4 back. Go watch the first Haunting in Connecticut; it's a MUCH better movie. This movie shouldn't even be called ""Haunting in Connecticut"". ""Ghosts of Georgia"" or something like ""The Haunting in Georgia"" would've been more appropriate of a title. The ""scariest"" thing in this is just a few of the gross out things involving puking up maggots, sawdust, and cockroaches, and they use that bit THREE times. This movie has 0 scare factor and is just wholly not in the least bit entertaining. There were even a few parts where I found myself laughing at how bad and predictable certain parts were. It'd be one thing if this movie were ""so bad it's good"" in a way, like if it was just super cheesy or campy, but it's none of those things. It's like eating a saltine cracker.

TL;DR
The movie sucks. It's almost below mediocre; absolutely bare-bones horror movie that's predictable to anyone that has been watching horror movies a while. Your $4 rental money is better spent on a GOOD horror movie rental like ""The Ring"" or ""The Conjuring.""",1505952000,,1350,4.625

5563761,2,B00B96TGQS,"If you took a couple hours to write a script and never gave the first draft a second thought, you'd end up with a similarly sloppy movie.  There is no character development, and the story is a hodgepodge of events seemingly thrown in to meet all the horror film cliches.  The problem with that is it doesn't meet the requirements for a horror as it's not scary.  Lots of crawling bug scenes that add nothing to the plot.  The acting was fine, but they had little to work with.  As many have commented here and elsewhere, the name is nonsensical; but I'm sure they were cashing in on the success of the first.  That's unfortunate as if they release another movie attached to this series, I will be waiting for it to come to streaming rather than renting it.  Not worth it.",1502236800,,771,4.387323943661972

5563799,4,B00B96TGQS,"For a low-budget movie, this turned out to be surprisingly good! The acting is good, the special effects are sufficiently creepy, and the historical twist makes for an interesting storyline. Overall, well worth adding to any haunting/horror movie collection (especially for $3.74).

This movie has a lot going for it. Sure, there are some things you'll have to overlook - starting with the claims that it's based on ""true"" events, but for a supernatural thriller it's actually pretty good. Here's why:

The acting is surprisingly good across the board. I've always been a fan of Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica), but I also recognized Chad Michael Murray (One Tree Hill) and Abigail Spencer - all three gave good performances. The child actress (Emily Alyn Lind) was also very good, with a great range of emotions - including a very creepy scene with her mother at the hospital.

The historical aspect of the movie - that the Wyrick family moves into a house that was part of the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, and the land is now haunted - sets this movie apart from typical ""haunted house"" movies. The ""twist"" at the end becomes pretty obvious early on in the movie, but despite that it was still an interesting storyline.

And the special effects were also very good for this type of movie. It isn't remotely scary, but it is definitely creepy. The set is perfect - the old house, the woods, the hiding place for the Underground Railroad - all of it created a great atmosphere for the movie. The trailer scene in particular had me cringing and whimpering a little - all signs of a good horror flick! My only real dislike was the low-budget use of red filters to indicate when someone was seeing a ghost. I think I could have followed the ""ghost"" moments just fine without constantly being ""told"" what was happening. But then again, maybe that's just me being too nit-picky.

And this is probably just me, but when the ""bad"" guy was finally revealed I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd seen that guy before. Took me a while to place it, but the taxidermist (horror version) looks a LOT like the Terrians from the TV show Earth 2. Google both and you'll see what I mean. Had to laugh a little - obviously the director and I watch the same things!

I think one of the greatest compliments I can give this movie is that I didn't hit the pause button even once. Usually I get fidgety or bored at some point during a movie and hit pause and wander off for a while. This one held my attention throughout the entire movie, and when it was over the first thing I said was, ""Wow - that was actually pretty good!"" I haven't seen the first movie or the Discovery Channel documentary, but I don't think either are necessary to enjoy this movie.

Overall, I think this is a great addition to the ""haunting"" genre, especially if you have an interest in historical thrillers. Well worth adding to your collection and you can't beat the price!",1445558400,,2948,4.614503816793893

5563824,3,B00B96TGQS,"I wasn't expecting much going into this film mostly due to the ridiculous title of the picture but I actually enjoyed the film. There was the basic elements here to be far more scarier but where held back by standard effects tricks that now plague paranormal movies almost to the point of making them boring. Yet at moments I felt actual suspense and eerie tension as more dramatic scenes unfolded into real chilling events. The setting and story was creepy  and the film version held a far more haunting presence than what I originally imagined from the actual story. The film veered from the true paranormal case with a more morbid, dark representation of the evil spirit haunting the land as well as the family.

The action sequences were produced well creating a relief from the mediocre dramatic moments that tended to case me to drift off. I found Ghosts Of Georgia to be a far better ghost flick its predecessor and think the film could have gained a better reception from audiences had they not gone with the title. This film had a great set up, acceptable acting, plus all the expected moments of creepy chilling paranormal activity. It isn't going to be a movie that really scares the hell out of anyone over the age of ten but it is a great movie about hauntings. The only downside was the very end after the amped up climax that felt way to hallmark-y, coming off completely cheesy and made for TV. I would tell people to see it and expect a better movie than The Haunting In Connecticut or The Apparition",1433462400,,1517,4.573529411764706

Great premise for a story with the background of the underground railroad and the creepy stationmaster as the historical haunting backdrop.

5563890,2,B00B96TGQS,"One ot the things I hate most about movies with great potential is how easily they can be ruined through utter pretentiousness and deception.

Here's a movie that had all the makings of a truly great movie: The premise of the overall story was mindblowing and highly thought provoking... but they immediately had to strike the first killing blow against it by naming after & associating it with ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" a movie based on another nationally famous hoax still being hyped as a ""true story/events"" sucker punch (can you say, ""Lutz Family"" and ""Amityville, NY""?), rather than allowing it to play out as a stand-alone movie with its own identity, and then pulling the same ""based on true story/events"" baloney as before by tacking the questionable-at-best Heidi Wyrick incident onto the plot board almost as an afterthought. From there, add copious amounts of unnecessary seizure-inducing jump cuts, camera jerks, and wild erratic light flashes, and what you've ended up with is a recipe for how to spin off an equally jeered turkey of a sequel about the paranormal from a universally critically panned earlier concept... leaving you with the insight that if the so-called ""prequel"" was handled in any way even moderately resembling this embarrassing facepalmer (admittedly, having never seen the first movie myself, and don't think I want to after this), then it provides an understandable explanation as to why ""The Haunting in Connecticut: Ghosts of Connecticut"" failed so horribly to win any respect from the world of film criticdom!

I give ""Connecticut: Georgia"" two (2) stars only because the story & concept really could've been awesome -- if only it had been allowed to be such, in the hands of somebody who had genuinely cared about telling a riveting tale, had shot & produced it smartly, and had insisted on allowing it to stand alone as its own unique entity (no pun was intended).",1423612800,,1911,5.0062893081761

The only similarities to the book and the movie are the names of the characters. The whole storyline about the Underground Railroad was not in book, which was written by Lisa's sister Joyce, who lived with her children in the house next door, not in a run down motorhome.  Lisa and her sister Joyce having visions is also NOT in the book. Lisa's mother never appeared to her in visions, because at the time this story takes place, she was very much alive.  This movie is so fictionalized I don't see how the producers can even claim it's ""loosely based on a true story.""  Read the book. No, it's not as scary as this movie, but it didn't need to be.

There's that old saying about how children should be seen and not heard, however in this case it's quite the opposite and we're not just talking' about ""I see dead people"" kinda stuff.
On the terror scale this movie ratchets up the ante to the nth degree.
The pace is right on and the storyline is completely believable; at the very least, it serves as an excellent allegory for the transgressions of the past which you'll have to discover for yourself when you watch this film; and you should.

The ""sequel"" has nothing to do with the Snedeker family or even the state of Connecticut.  Having said this, the second movie is actually a better story.  Ghosts of Georgia, as it should have been titled is about a family that acquires a house that use to be part of the underground railroad before the Civil War. The movie is scary but actually has a rather happy ending.  I found the movie to be unique and to have a better story line  compared to most modern horror films.",1412899200,,697,4.626016260162602

There was some fairly gory moments in the last parts of the film, but for the most part, it just gave a sense of ""dread"" and anticipation of something bad about to happen. There really was a nice element of suspense here that I like if I am going to view what is considered a ""horror thriller"".  Blood and guts are not frightening to me, they are disgusting.

Some cheap scares at the front end to try to start off the mood and it's a little slow, but maintains a steady 3 stars.  Then, it just goes down hill with a slower pace.  The twist at the ending is evident about midway through when the movie tries to confuse the audience as to whether the ghost the little girl sees is good or bad.  By this time, I didn't care if the ghost was good or bad.  Now, it's down to 2 stars, but not so entrenched in the realm of 2 stars that it can't recover to 3 stars and possibly 4 stars.  ......but, the ending.  The ending is stupid.  Someone must have told the clowns in charge of this movie that the Academy Awards gives an Oscar for the stupidest ending so they went for broke.  It felt like ABC Afterschool Special except not as scary.  Even though it hasn't succeeded in its primary purpose as a horror flick, it reaches for another goal- moralistic politically correct message.  The cheap kind.

5563968,5,B00B96TGQS,"First, I agree with everyone that thinks the title was a big mistake.

Second,  Let's make one thing clear for all the people who keep complaining that it wasn't the true story.  A movie / story that claims to BE a true story is one thing.  We usually call it a documentary.  A movie / story that is BASED on a true story is just what says,  a movie that uses a true story as it's starting point.  This is called a DRAMA.  You should TRY to learn the difference.

Ghosts of Georgia is a classic horror-drama with a few new twists.  The settings are excellent and look very real (I live in Georgia).  The acting, for the most part is exceptionally good for this kind of film,  and all the main actors are very easy on the eyes.  The anticipation builds slowly so you don't notice how uneasy you're getting till you realize you're on the edge of your seat. Then the real scares and horrors come almost non-stop,  and you think they're going to go on forever.  By the end of the movie I felt as worn out as the actors looked.

If some of the horrors seem unrealistic,  remember it's fear that makes them seem that way.  If your looking for blood, guts and slashers you won't like this film.  If your looking for high quality, scary movies,  they just don't get much better than this one.",1410220800,,1284,4.270833333333333

When you watched the film ""The Shining,"" the 70's version, and the mother is so annoyingly stupid that you beg for her character to die? That's pretty much what the mother is like in this film. Clearly the mother in the fake ghost story the film was based off of was sick of her daughter getting all the camera time and was fine ok-ing her 10 minutes of shame. Seriously, research how many times this family has been on tv saying ""We'll never talk about this again to anyone. It was just too frightening."" For people who never wanna talk about it, they sure do talk about it to anyone with a TV show who pays.
""Starbuck"" has her usual inability to act role, not that acting was required for this film. She's a female version of Keano Reeves. A woodpecker could sit on her face, pecking away at it, and she couldn't emote enough to brush it away.
I'm fairly sure the entire budget for this film went to hair extensions, which weren't even good. I've seen better hair extensions on a meth head.
The best actor in the film was the dog and I'm a cat person so you know the dog was that good. I hope he got paid the most money. His emoting, line delivery and believability were far superior to the humans. The dog should have gotten hazard pay to be in this film. The poor thing will have a smear on his acting reputation. I for one hope the dog can move passed this mistake and find a good script to work with next time. The humans, well, they never could act to start with. I'm fairly sure that won't change any time soon.
At least the dad was good looking.

The most upsetting thing about the sequel is that it is a true story, but the movie does not have anything to do with the actual story.  The real story shockingly, not has nothing to do with any kind of negative energy at all.  It actually is quite a heartwarming story to say the least.  The haunting in Georgia is actually about a family that moves into a new house, only to discover that their young daughter might be seeing a ghost, come to find out she connected with her grandfather who had already passe, cd and whom she had never met.  playtime, and conversations could it be possible that our loved ones can make contact with us and our children on the other side. pretty amazing if you ask me.

Yeah, that is a pretty good background for a horror movie. But this didn't suit well for me. It was boring and the plot was confusing. This was not easy to follow.

Pleasant twist rears it's head about 2/3 of the way through but many of the classic ""Don't do that!!!"" mistakes and the sister who believes but seems oblivious to evil.

For me I enjoyed this because it was in many ways an old fashion scary movie with a good plot, good location, excellent acting and fortunately a little less ""gory"" than most horror movies. Movies are all about entertainment and this one was entertaining.

One last thing, it had nothing to do with a ""Haunting in Connecticut"" and was more a  ""Haunting in Georgia"", so yes, I believe the title is misleading.",1391817600,,572,4.377358490566038

I think that this was originally meant to start another horror franchise but wound up being financed as a sequel.  The main antagonist (hybrid ghost/monster) is more than a little reminiscent of the Jeepers Creepers monster and is actually named the Station Master.  That is a franchise name if I ever heard one.  I think Lionsgate bought this property and had no idea what to do with it once they fully read the clunky and predictable script.

I thought the performances were all top notch, and I loved little touches like Heidi ""learning balance"" with her bike, paralleling her mother's struggle with her medications.

It takes place in Georgia and has nothing to do with the family in the first movie, nor to any of the paranormal investigators from the first movie, that I am aware of. It is fairly well acted and has good scares. The extras on the DVD with the real family was interesting. Movies with kids interacting with the ghosts just seem creepier to me. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS........... Although the entire female family are clairvoyants, only one sister embraces it (or so she claims, but she is fairly terrified by most things she sees, though I guess I would be also). We see the mother attempt to medicate her ability to see the spirit world away, as did her mother we are told at some point. When the mom realizes that her child has also received this dubious gift, she refuses to believe it, tries to get her child to ignore it. The movie climaxes with a good example of what a mother will do to save her child. Overall, it is good fun.",1390435200,,1146,4.334883720930232

Well let me tell you this movie has sooo much more than the documentary and I don't understand why the certain things the movie showed was not shown or mentioned in the documentary! So I said to myself this movie is in another class by itself and said this isn't the documentary and so rate this for what it is.

The only thing I didn't like is  the title, it  is awful! People this movie doesn't have ANYTHING to do with ""A Haunting in Connecticut"". Nowhere near it and it get a bonus from me because it had actress Cicely Tyson a damned great actress that play in all those slave movies. For people that like that actress and like slave history this movie is for you. I recommend you check it out right away.

I do like the story line they used - it certainly added to the eeriness of the plot and seemed to fit the times.

5564147,2,B00B96TGQS,"Bottom line: A movie that isn't as slick or as scary as it thinks it is. Attempts to capitalize on the ""success"" of the first movie that was mediocre in execution to begin with. The first movie was mediocre, this one is terrible.

The story had potential with a great tie-in with the underground railroad. Aside from that little history is given, and the second half of the movie devolves into sheer silliness. It literally became hard to watch.

The cast was in a word, terrible. I don't know if it was the script, the casting director, film director or what, but lets cover the bases here: I'm sorry the little girl was just not believable. She tried, but talent isn't there (yet, maybe?) The father was a simple miscast. A skinny pretty boy with perfect George Micheal hair and not-quite-grown-in chops that is supposed to be a correctional officer? Sure, that fits. Please research characters, Mr. casting director. (HINT: Not too many correctional officers manscape.) The mother delivers a wooden performance, and the sister who looks nothing like her sibling - is absolutely forgettable (why is she there again?) Are these people from Georgia? No accents, huh? Too hard for them, or are they supposed to be actors?

The direction was horrible. You know how in really good horror movies there is a tangible buildup of tension? Not here. The director starts busting out shadowy figures in flickering visibility within the first 10 minutes. Lame, and with absolutely no character development, and you just don't care about the little girl in the hole, the George Micheal dad, or the two sisters that are as wooden as the remains of the ""Station Managers"" shack.  You do get a ton of old horror gags. From the blind old woman, to the plethora of insects, shadowy figures, flashbacks, the mother and family with the ""gift"" of seeing dead people to the very ""Ring""-like ""We shouldn't have helped the spirit, we made things worse,"" the movie is full of gags from superior films that never seem to work.

The effect you do have here is the tried and true ""CG scream with the enlarged bottom jaw and gaping mouth"" that was made famous by ""The Mummy Returns"", also a horrible movie. Directors, please take note: The effect is not scary, it is stupid. Stop doing it.

For those going to respond with the ""Hey, it's a horror movie it's not supposed to be Shakespeare"", please spare me. Every time you give garbage like this a pass, we get more garbage. We should be getting smart, scary, stylized visions of horror. Not a poor sequel named after a mediocre original that has nothing to do with said original.",1384473600,,2602,4.720264317180617
5564148,2,B00B96TGQS,"This was not in the least bit scary. The beginning and end seemed weak, and along the way there were loads of Indiana Jones CG sfx which were unconvincing. The often BW distort camera sequences were not convincing either, and the story was really heavy going the way it was told. The females were not much fun, and young actresses need to remember that acting is also a physical thing. I remember that when I saw this in the theater at a one-off screening, there were quite a lot of people there but they were bored, getting up and down and moving around a lot. The publicity still did not appear to be in the film, and film fans should remember how valuable their money is and accept only the longest most complete versions. If you want a film from 2013 try Maniac, Dracula, Last Exorcism 2, or even The Conjuring and You're Next. Give this one a miss unless you are very easily satisfied.",1383350400,,890,4.4

First of all, how dare they title this movie after The Haunting of Connecticut? It's based on a true story based in Georgia?!? They used the success of Haunting of Connecticut to propel their movie which I think was misleading to people that buy the movie.

This movie has nothing to do with the original, this movie is about a family moving into a old house that was once used as part of the underground railroad by a man that was obsessed with taxidermy. The story line was sooooo slow, there was nothing scary about the movie, the charters were not developed well, the charters kept making stupid decesions (like most charaters in horror movie).

5564153,4,B00B96TGQS,"This movie should have just been titled Ghosts of Georgia.  The connection with the previous movie is that both true story lines were used in TV programs, maybe A Haunting and on Paranormal Witness.  They were both stretched a bit for scares, but the basic concept is there.  The TV treatments of Ghosts of Georgia didn't have the underground railroad information in them, just the ""Mr. Gordy"" ghost along with one of his relatives.  I enjoyed the addition.

I am a big fan of ghost stories and the paranormal in books and movies.  So I appreciate anything that has good writing with good acting and photography, and this is better than average.  All the characters are well rounded people you like.  Mom is uptight and in denial about her abilities, dad is confused but accepting, auntie is a free spirit and the daughter is learning to deal with it all.  They are in a situation where their abilities attract things that have to be faced.

I am very happy with this addition to my movie collection, and I look forward to the industry using other ""true stories"" of the paranormal in this way.  Anyone who enjoys being spooked will like this movie!",1381968000,2,1148,4.633663366336633

It relied a great deal of fast moving ghosts (which happens at alarming frequency which added to the bad movie) combined with idiotic loud drum sounds to ""scare"" you (it didn't scare at all), and that scarecrow killer ghost was too far fetched that made the whole thing laughable.  There was even a kindly old geezer ghost who held up the child's bicycle in the end - well, you would have to go out of your way to think of something so corny it was beyond idiotic.  I watched this move and put it where it belong - I threw it in the trash.  Seriously.  There is no way I'm going to watch this garbage twice. It left me feeling depressed since I was - ONCE AGAIN - ripped off. I simply don't trust modern horror movies because I got burned watching garbage and some so stupid I could not even bear to watch it to the end.  If you are into corn, get this movie.  And the killer scarecrow ghost - don't forget that -- off the cob.  As for being ""based on true events"" people make claims all the time-for a buck, and attention.

5564177,3,B00B96TGQS,"It seems that everything ghostly has become a part of today's culture. Not only are there three major ghost hunting series on TV now but shows about haunting and paranormal experiences have flooded the airwaves. While ghosts have been the subject of numerous movies it's rare that these stories are done justice. With the release of A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT a few years ago that changed. Enough to warrant a sequel which has now ended up going straight to DVD.

A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT 2: GHOSTS OF GEORGIA has nothing to do with Connecticut nor the ghosts found in that first film. Apparently the producers wanted to start a franchise and felt that A HAUNTING IN GEORGIA  would not have been a clear enough title for fans of the first film. I think viewers are smart enough to figure this out, even more so if a new state were added with each film. I doubt all 50 states would have been hit though.

Once again ""based on a true story"", we have the Wyrick family who have just moved into a new house with a large acreage for their young daughter to roam around in. Bought cheap (never a good sign) and empty for some time now things begin to happen right away. Heidi, the little girl, starts talking to a man she calls Mr. Gordy and he's started telling her things about the house and property. This might seem like an imaginary play pal except for the history of Heidi's mother.

Lisa Wyrick is trying to get over a problem she's had for years, one where she hears voices in her head and sees things that aren't there. On medication she's rejected what her mother and her sister believed, that their family is gifted with ""the veil"". This gift gives them the power to see things others don't which would of course include dead people. Sister Joyce has moved onto the property with Lisa, Lisa's husband Andy and Heidi, living in an old trailer near the house. While Heidi's mother tries to tell Heidi there's nothing there, Joyce explains what ""the veil"" is to her.

Mr. Gordy at first seems to be a benevolent ghosts going so far as to let the family know where some old money was buried. But when they begin looking into his past they're not quite sure. Further delving reveals that Mr. Gordy's grandfather was a taxidermist who used the property to aid slaves heading north, a part of the famous Underground Railroad. Heidi and Lisa both begin to see the images of slaves on the property with Heidi feeling nothing is wrong but Lisa still trying to ignore all she sees.

When things begin to go bad, including the disappearance of Heidi only to be found in a strange pit, they bring in a local preacher to help rid her of what they think is a possession. But there is more going on on this property than anyone realizes and a history that is far darker than anyone knows or could imagine.

That dark back story makes this movie more interesting than most. Many will toss this movie off as just another straight to DVD feature that doesn't stand on its own merits but I would beg to differ. The story was well thought out and the reveal is one most won't see coming. Extras on the DVD include talks with the original family, Heidi now grown up, talking about what they experienced while living there.

There are a few jump scenes in the film but this movie doesn't play on the scare factor and relies more on the story to make its points. It offers some nice entertainment value and will be a movie that makes a nice starter point for people wanting to discuss ghosts and whether they actually exist or not. The production values are extremely well done unlike some horror films where night scenes are so dark as to not be able to see anything. In this production everything from the camera work to the acting is well done.

My guess is there won't be another HAUTING IN film made. I would think that this film would be passed over in light of other major releases coming out at the same time.

5564181,4,B00B96TGQS,"The Haunting in Connecticut 2: The Ghosts of Georgia has earned a pretty bad reputation due to two things: First is the title, having a movie that is called Haunting in Connecticut and having it take place in Georgia wasn't a very smart choice, they should of went with what they were going to originally name it and that was The Haunting in Georgia. Secondly is that though it is played off as a sequel, it is not a direct sequel to the first film due to the fact that there is no connection between the two films, except for the fact they are both based on true stories. If you can look past these 2 problems this is actually a very entertaining movie.

Ghosts of Georgia follows the story of a young family who move into their new home in the backwoods of Georgia. Soon after,  the couples young daughter begins to see the ghost of the previous owner Mr. Gordy. The girls mother doesn't believe her, even though she herself has the same gift, but chooses to take medication to try an block it. It doesn't take long for the young girls vision intensifies and she begins to see more and more ghosts.

What makes this movie stand out is that there is quite a mystery throughout the movie, that keeps you guessing. Is Mr. Gordy the devil in disguise, what happened to the stationmaster and why. The mystery really helps to drive the story and it keeps you drawn into the movie.

Now onto the based on a true story part. This movie is based on the experiences of the Wyrick family. Like the first Haunting in Connecticut movie this movie does stretch the truth quite a lot, but that is Hollywood and that is what makes for good horror movies. For any horror movie reality has to be stretched in some way shape or form, and to put this movie down do to that fact or the fact that the title was a bad choice just isn't really fair.

If you love a good ghost story, and this flick had plenty of ghosts and scares, this is right up your alley. It is definitely worth your time to check this one out, even if you just rent it, but myself, I am glad I bought it, because I have already watched it numerous times.

And by the way there is no nudity or sex in this film, and hardly any gore, now that might turn away some horror fans, but I promise that you won't even pay attention to that, because you will be so drawn in to the story. Hope you all enjoy!",1369612800,,2347,4.227678571428571

The original was more of a documentary which Hollywood turned into an unrealistic cheese fest.

I enjoyed the film. The ghost aspect was well done, unfortunately there was too much of it. Like Savannah, you couldn't throw a stone without hitting a ghost. What was with the levitating thing on the cover? I'm not sure what this film had to do with the first one as Connecticut seems to be more connected to King Arthur's Court than Georgia.

5564192,4,B00B96TGQS,"I enjoyed the first Haunting in Connecticut and was eager to watch this second installment based on my brother's recommendation (both of us love horror movies, especially supernatural-themed ones). My brother also told me that there is a lot of history in this film so my curiosity was piqued.

Aside from the title (Haunting in Connecticut), this is a totally different film. First of all it is set in Georgia and revolves around a new cast of characters. I guess the use of The Haunting... title is to show that it is part of a series of movies? Well, it did not affect my enjoyment of the film, in fact, I liked it and enjoyed the historical thread in the narrative.

The film centers on the Wyrick family comprising Andy (Chad Michael Murray), Lisa (Abigail Spencer), and young Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind). They are soon joined by Lisa's sister, Joyce (Katee Sackhoff) who bunks in at the old trailer by their house. Set in the countryside, the isolated house has historic significance, and soon enough the Wyrick family and Joyce discover that they are not the only inhabitants in the house and the surroundings. Lisa has the 'sight' but has shut this 'gift' out of her, taking pills to avoid dealing with the disturbing visions that intrude upon her thoughts. Her husband Andy is understanding and tries to help her, but is frustrated by her refusal to accept the reality of her gift. When young Heidi begins seeing a mysterious character named Mr. Gordy, only her aunt Joyce seems to show compassion and understanding. Lisa is upset that her daughter has inherited this family trait of being able to see supernatural entities, and her way of dealing with it is by demanding Heidi block it out.

As time passes, a series of mysterious events occur around the area and also in the house. Spectral beings are seen by Lisa, Heidi, and Joyce, and after a visit by the local preacher, the family comes to learn that a former inhabitant of the house was a Stationmaster in the Underground Railroad, providing shelter to escaped slaves before they made their way to the North and freedom. As time passes, the supernatural events escalate to the point where the family's very existence is threatened. The question is: What do the supernatural entities want?

The story has some interesting twists in it that keeps viewers engaged with the plot. I enjoyed the historical thread in the plot and how it tied in with the supernatural occurrences. There were some unexpected twists that made it even more interesting, and the main characters though not great, delivered credible performances, although I must admit I got tired of Lisa's refusal to accept that her daughter was indeed being visited by supernatural entities and could see spooky stuff.

Overall, this made for an entertaining supernatural film and held my attention. The weaving in of historical aspects elevated Ghosts of Georgia above the average, ho-hum horror flick. The production qualities were good, and there was a high sense of atmosphere which works great in movies like this. I would rate this as mildly scary but if you enjoy some history in your horror films then this would be worth a try.",1367280000,3,3157,4.817343173431734
5564193,3,B00B96TGQS,"Let me preface this by saying I remember watching the real life documentary of this movie years ago. I was completely intrigued by the story and the documentary really gave me some frights. When I heard they were bringing the sister documentary Haunting in Connecticut to the big screen, I was hoping Georgia would get a similar treatment. Flash forward and here it is! All in all, Ghost of Georgia is a decent scary movie. The actors were all enjoyable and I knew a lot of them from various TV shows. Even the plot is decent and easy to follow, without any gaping holes to speak of. My issue was that there weren't enough frights! Haunting in Connecticut scared the bejeezus out of me, but Georgia didn't really make a blip on my scare meter. At times it got a tad too preachy when discussing slavery and the events that occurred on the Underground Railroad. It wasn't a great film, but it's worth a rental!

5564196,1,B00B96TGQS,"This is not the first time the Wyrick story has been brought to mass audiences. The ghost story shared a three-part episode of Unsolved Mysteries in February 1989 and Virginia-based New Dominion Pictures added its 94-minute IMDb viewer-rated 6.4 version in 2002. Both accounts made an effort to respect the source material in delivering an atmospheric ghost story with an overtone of the grave. So with that in mind, my question for the Wyrick family is as follows ...

Why have you not denounced this Hollywood boondoggle as a farce? How can you let Lionsgate / Gold Circle and its goofy screenwriter David Coggeshall claim that the film is ""based on a true story?"" How can you let them display photos of your family at the conclusion of the ""film""? I would identify all the ways the film deviated from the real story, but it seems absurd to mention Lisa Wyrick's ability to see dead people (she has none) in the same paragraph as a resurrected taxidermist who lured runaway slaves into his dungeon masquerading as a station point for the Underground Railroad. The real Wyrick story is in no way rumored to be connected to the Underground Railroad. But hey, the crawl spaces in the Snedecker home (A Haunting in Connecticut) were not stuffed to the gills with corpses either.

How can anyone claim to like this albatross? Seriously. A corpse (or ghost of a corpse) abducting and assaulting the living? This is no longer the Wyrick story. This is no longer a GHOST story. This is now Creature from the Black Lagoon.

I would have laughed at all the liberties taken with this story if something vital wasn't truly lost to these disrespectful clowns at Lionsgate / Gold Circle. There is evil about this Lionsgate story, but its the ticketmaster and not some fabricated station master at the root of it. Evidence of ghosts is hard enough to come by that when we do encounter compelling stories with certain kinds of validity, we need to preserve their integrity -- not use them as the jumping off point for some wildly fantastical nonsense designed to heat some pools in Tinseltown. Make no mistake -- hack horror writer David Coggeshall took a ghost story that received significant attention from world renown scientific investigators and turned it into The Evil Dead. There's a special place in hell for people like him (probably the same level where Woody Allen put the inventor of aluminum siding in Deconstructing Harry).

And if the hack job wasn't enough, the film did not even deliver scares. How much elegance -- how much high art -- can we expect from a film given the most clumsy title in Hollywood history? Usually when you decide to contort yourself in whatever way is necessary to piggyback off another film, it's usually a critically acclaimed or commercially successful film. A Haunting in Connecticut was neither. In fact, a documentary film company from Suffolk, Virginia is more celebrated for its version of the Connecticut ghost story than the Lionsgate Hollywood studio. Ghosts of Georgia is as connected to A Haunting in Connecticut as the 2002 academy award-winning Chicago was to Woody Allen's Manhattan.

And this was no joy to watch. It was made tedious by the constant labored efforts to tickle our startle reflex -- efforts that are purely mechanical in nature (the images themselves were not interesting or scary). We're treated to our first CGI-generated apparition just 10 seconds into the film and from there it's non-stop ghosts. How a film manages to turn a phenomenon as exotic and controversial as ghosts into common termites is beyond me.

Anyway congratulations on the paycheck. Horror films like this are relatively inexpensive to make nowadays and the profit margin must have good even after coaxing just a few million at the low end of the IQ scale into the theaters. And from what I understand, Gold Circle is set to destroy yet another New Dominion psychodrama titled ""The Diabolical,"" which will be renamed A Haunting in New York.",1366934400,5,3972,4.868343195266272
5564197,4,B00B96TGQS,"First off, let's just get something out of the way. ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" never had a chance to succeed. With a paradoxical title like that, audiences are given a red flag immediately. If the producers of a movie can't decide on a better name for a film, then how could they make bigger decisions during production? Just pick a name! Was ""Ghosts of Georgia"" any more generic than ""The Haunting in Connecticut?"" The reason I sound so frustrated is because it deserves better.

The Wyrick family moves into a country house in Georgia. Their daughter, Heidi, soon begins telling her parents she talks to a man who warns they're in danger. Upon investigating, they find out their house is located on land once owned by a stationmaster of the Underground Railroad. The souls of the slaves are restless and begin haunting the family for unknown reasons.

Director Tom Elkins and writer David Coggeshall put together quite an impressive ghost story with ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia."" While ""based on a true story,"" it's obvious some creative license is utilized to spice things up. However, there are some genuinely frightening moments that will resonate with viewers. Let's just say Elkins and Coggeshall know our innermost fears and exploits them.

The entire cast of ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" put forth their best efforts and embrace their individual characters. You can tell they took the material seriously and ran with it. Chad Michael Murray plays the father of the family. Abigail Spencer takes on the role of the mother. Katee Sackhoff portrays Spencer's free-spirited sister who comes to live with them. Emily Alyn Lind is perfect in as the little girl Heidi. She embraces the role straight-faced with an air of authentic innocence.

The audio and video high definition transfers for the film are good. The picture is clean and the colors all breathe life into the visual experience. My only problem with how the movie looks are the ""dimensional"" sequences and the way they're shot, edited, and colored. They give it a cheap, straight-to-DVD feel that is distracting. The 5.1 surround sound mix provides all the immersive bumps, slams, jarring musical blares, screams, and haunting whispers horror fans have come to expect from these types of films.

Special features for ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" will satisfy consumers. Audio commentary is provided by Director Tom Elkins, Writer David Coggeshall, and Co-Producer Brad Kessell. There's a 10-minute featurette in which we meet the real members of the Wyrick family and hear their experiences firsthand. Deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes, and a theatrical trailer are included as well.

""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" is a good supernatural tale that should have been released in theaters like its predecessor. There are nice twists to the story, the acting is good, and the scares are genuinely creepy. Maybe it's selfish, but I was looking forward to seeing the movie on a big screen in a quiet atmosphere where it could have my full attention.

5564200,1,B00B96TGQS,"This film just gets to the scares too early in the film and scarcely sets anything up for the audience. The film takes its story from the Discovery Channel episode of a Haunting In Georgia, which, on the DVD was the flip-side of A Haunting in Connecticut. To add some confusion, the title of this film does not take place in Connecticut, and barely even mentions that they are in Georgia, but at this point is just riding the coattails of the ""success"" of A Haunting in Connecticut. Now why a low budget documentary on the Discovery Channel gets the story right, while this movie (and the Connecticut one) seem to make wild nonsense out it into a story that has no relation to reality.

I am not a firm ghost believer, but I like a good ghost story. This movie, tells the story of a family moving into a new house, and suddenly are foisted with all these incidents. Of course the mom/wife is on medicate for her mental illness and their daughter, Emily, starts seeing things. They of course believe that maybe she has inherited this illness. Sooner than later, everyone is seeing ghosts.

To put it simply, they see ghosts. The ghosts don't seem hostile. They just appear most of the time. Play a few bars on the piano. Change the radio station. Make noises in the woods. What is disturbing about this film is not so much the ghosts, but the film seems to want to confuse the audience by having us guess whether what we see is something of a mental illness (ala hallucinations) or whether they are really ghosts haunting them.

There seems to be no reason for their appearance. And some of the instances do not make any sense what so ever. I would watch the Discovery Channel documentary before watching this as I thought it was much scarier, and it made more sense - both as a story and in reality.

5564204,3,B00B96TGQS,"There are just too many ghosts here. There's a manifestation a minute. Ghosts are running around all over, lessening the impact of any particular vision.

This haunting takes place exclusively in Georgia. If you are curious why the main movie title is then ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" - it seems to be because this is a continuation of a series ""based on true stories"" whose first entry was indeed set in Connecticut. That first haunting also was plagued by too many sightings.

In each case, the producers of these films take a real family's report of having been haunted in their new homes, and riff on those experiences. They cobble together a back story that explains the sufferings that have been causing the dead to reappear, shrieking for justice or simple acknowledgment.

Here the impulse that drove this host of ghosts to appear centers around some of the history of the pre-Civil War days. There were horrors suffered aplenty then, but this movie focuses on a uniquely horrible (and hopefully fictional) fate suffered by some of those seeking freedom through the Underground Railroad. It's an interesting idea about how far dementia carried one man. But again, the idea gets swamped by the sheer numbers of ghosts who appear to re-play the drama of the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.

There are also lots of extras on this DVD. There's a director's/writer's commentary. Then there's an interview with the family whose experiences inspired this story. The female members of this family believe their sensitivity to the spirit-world stems from the fact that they were born with a ""veil."" That's the caul, part of the amniotic sac, that occasionally comes along with the baby, and that used to be widely believed to predict an ability to communicate with the nether regions.

There is some interesting history and atmospherics here. But to make the tale even remotely believable, and therefore scary, it should have been handled with much more restraint and subtlety.",1366502400,,1983,4.978851963746224
5564205,2,B00B96TGQS,"""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" follows a family's nightmarish descent into a centuries-old Southern hell.  When Andy Wyrick (Chad Michael Murray) moves with wife Lisa (Abigail Spencer) and daughter Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind) to a historic home in Georgia, they quickly discover they are not alone.  Joined by Lisa's free-spirited sister, Joyce (Katee Sackhoff), they soon come face to face with a chilling mystery.  Heidi sees visions of the Underground Railroad and it happens that the new family home is located in a part of the state where lots of runaway slaves were killed.

Cicely Tyson pops up for a few minutes as a old blind woman issuing creepy, ominous portents, and there are rotting corpses, gruesome special effects, and eerie old codgers for atmosphere, but the film depends mostly on cheap scares and ghost-tale cliches. Given that this film bears no relation to ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" the title is the dumbest of the year.

5564206,3,B00B96TGQS,"Aside from the ridiculous title which is an obvious ploy to cash in on the marginal success of "" The haunting in Connecticut"" the ""Georgia"" sequel lacks the ingenuity and creepy structure of the original - and it does so in spades.

Another film supposedly based on a ""true story"" leaves much to be desired - especially for horror film buffs. However the effects are quite decent but alas predictable in the very real sense that there's nothing here we either don't see coming or haven't seen before.

Abigail Spencer and Chad Michael Murray do their best with the convoluted script and fractured dialogue. Young child actress Emily  Lind at only four years of age actually turns in one of the more compelling performances. Director Tom Elkins creates a dismal and spooky enough atmosphere but again the story line is fractured - and even the best of the scares are unfortunately forgettable.

One shinning jewel is seeing the great Cicely Tyson who does indeed turn in albeit brief an excellent performance and perhaps for these positive points alone the movie is well worth seeing. However I recommend waiting to see it for free - which should be any time now.",1366502400,6,1162,4.795

I would rate this with Ghost Story - a classy, creepy, well-done ghost story.  Enjoy!",1366070400,,383,4.053333333333334

In my opinion, the first Haunting in Connecticut (not in any way related to this movie) was better and a lot creepier, with better acting and suspense. I got a few scares during this movie, and the ending was decent. Worth watching if you like scary movies...and it never hurts to look at Chad Michael Murray;)",1366070400,,387,4.388888888888889

However if its the one im thinking of then any one tree hill fan will be pleased with it only because our beloved  lucas plays a rugged  father and hes awesome. The plot was very good but the scare factor just wasn't quite there they needed a scarier bad guy. However the acting was phenomenal .,1365897600,,401,4.333333333333333

5564218,5,B00B96TGQS,I thought this movie was great. I really didn't like the first Haunting in Connecticut. I was worried about renting this one but figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did. I loved it and plan to buy it.,1364083200,2,211,3.8181818181818183
5564219,2,B00B96TGQS,Perhaps I was expecting too much in terms of this movie delivering a good scare.  What I got - halfway through this movie I turned the TV off and never saw the ending. Part one was not any better.,1364083200,,196,4.0256410256410255
5564220,4,B00B96TGQS,"When I first saw that there was a sequel to ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" I was EXTREMELY upset.  1)The original ""Haunting in Connecticut"" movie was not all together factually true (there were never any bodies found in the walls of the house), and it didn't really follow the informative documentary from the Discovery Channel.  2)How can you have a sequel to something that never had a second part?!  So, it was with great trepidation that I approached ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2,"" and quite honestly if Katee Sackhoff wasn't in it, I can't honestly say that I would have watched it.

With that said...  I'm VERY glad that I did watch this movie!  The story line is actually pretty good and is guaranteed to satisfy Horror fans that are even the hardest to please (like myself).  The characters could use a little more fleshing out (it's kinda hard to take Abigail Spencer as Lisa Wyrick when she doesn't really accept the character.  It almost feels like she is trying to accept how she fits as Lisa Wyrick, rather than actually BEING Lisa Wyrick.), but all in all they are pretty well developed and comfortable (including Chad Michael Murray!  How far you've come since playing Tristan on the Gilmore Girls!). The story line isn't what you would think, and covers things from the Underground Railroad to Psychic phenomena (the ""Shine"" as Stephen King termed it), to family values.  All in all, I have to say that I give this movie two very enthusiastic thumbs up!  It's a GREAT watch, and is bound to be a classic in the annals of the Horror genre.",1363996800,2,1556,4.6838235294117645

And I'm always a little put off by movies that claim to be ""based on a real story,"" so I was skeptical from the start, but this one does try to go above simply trying to scare you and genuinely tries to develope the lives of the ghosts in the stories, so much so that my nephew was in tears by the end of it.  I think one of the ghosts reminded him of his grandfather with whom he has a special relationship.",1363564800,,539,3.9722222222222223

5564224,3,B00B96TGQS,Overall I liked the movie. The acting was good but not great. I wish the mother was more aggressive in really knowing what was going on with her daughter and taking her more seriously than being in total denial of the obvious paranormal activity that was going on around them that she herself was experiencing. She almost lost her daughter to the dark entities that she herself refused to acknowledge was real.,1363046400,,410,4.708333333333333

When they find out the people she is talking to are the dead people that used to live in the house they become very worried and wonder if they can do anything about it before its too late for her, and them. I will admit that the first one creeped my out quite a bit so I was a little scared already going in to this one. While the first one was more psychological this one is way more in your face scary, and to me thats not as good. I'm also not sure why this is called what it is. The movie has nothing to do with the first one, and it's not even in Connecticut, but that is another review. Since this technically is a sequel though I can say that like most sequels this isn't as good as the first one. Overall, like the first one in name only. I give it a C+.",1362268800,5,1007,3.9411764705882355

5564231,3,B00B96TGQS,"Although I thought the movie was decent for what it is the makers of this film should not have claimed that it is based on true events, because for those of us who know the original Wyrick story this movie is no where close to their story. Well, let me take that back. There is a Lisa, Andy, Joyce, Heidi, and yes a man named Mr. Gordy, but that is where the true details end. There was never mention of the Underground Railroad in their original story, and Pine Mountain to my knowledge does not have a connection to the Underground Railroad. And the house they lived in was not centuries old like the movie, but a ranch style cinder-block home. I could have enjoyed this movie much more, if they left the Wyrick backstory out of it. And for future films, which I know they'll make, leave ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" out of it. This was ""A Haunting in Georgia"".",1362096000,45,864,4.372670807453416

5564237,3,B00B96TGQS,"Besides super sexy actress Abigail Spencer and the superb performance by baby-face child prodigy, actress Emily Lind, what else is nice about this movie? I find it challenging to even rate this movie at this time.

I gave ""Mama"" (2013) a 4-star rating, so how can I give this movie a similar rating since ""Mama"" (2013) is so genuinely scary that it outstrips the ""Ghosts of Georgia"" by at least 10 times (subjectively speaking)?

OK, I'll give 5/5 stars to all the major characters of this movie and their acting skills + a 5/5 rating to the finale, the closing scenes.

Everything else in between the first and last scenes is passable for a basic horror movie that doesn't give too many surprises, and hence, resulting in dilution of my final rating.

The art cover of the DVD and the movie posters have no relevance to any scene in the movie.

I've unanswered questions after watching this movie:

Who killed the evil station master back in ancient times? The ghosts OR the Ku Klux Klan (KKK)? Did the KKK kill him first, followed by the black ghosts came after his lingered haunted soul in a replay of the same death scene?

Note on a movie blooper:

A Protestant pastor is NOT a [Catholic] ""priest"". The couple was told to see a ""priest"". A Prot pastor is but a layman with NO sacramental powers and isn't even in the Church to begin with, thus drawing no powers from the Treasury of Merits of the eternal Church. He apes the externals of the Church (ie. the purple stole over his shoulders, etc.) but owns NO ordained powers of the Apostolic Catholic sacramental system. That's why the violent hauntings continued even after his one-time ""prayers"".

Say you've a serious illness, instead of seeing a professional specialist (in this case, a real, validly ordained Catholic priest), you go instead to a street preacher who merely claims to heal by the laying of hands or a street vendor selling ""wonder healing oils"". What kind of results would you expect then? Common sense ought to prevail. When it comes to earthly physical ailments, people can often tell a real doctor from a quack, but curiously enough, when it comes to spiritual matters, somehow, most people prefer quack ""doctors"" whose personal and organizational histories are at best questionable.

This review may be edited at a later time, if I've the time!

5564244,4,B00B96TGQS,"The only similarity between this movie and the original 'Haunting in Connecticut' is the title. Two totally different movies.. Ghosts of Georgia actually takes place in Georgia and nothing about Connecticut is ever mentioned.

The story is based on a couple and their daughter, who just moved into a new home in the countryside of Georgia. Their daughter begins seeing people or ghosts, and the story of who lived on this property years ago begins to unfold. It has to do with the underground railroad, slavery and is supposedly 'based on a true story'.

Overall it's a good film. It has a pretty good story-line and manages to keep you interested throughout, with constant ghost scenes. The movie really strives on it's good acting by Chad Michael Murray, Abigal Spencer & Emily Alyn Lind.

A true ghost story, and very well done. Definitely worth a watch!",1361059200,62,857,4.8561643835616435

New story that is interesting and capturing but leaves you wondering why the producers/directors decided to deviate from the original location of the first film. I also understand how the first movie ended, that might leave little to continue. Overall a good film. Maybe the writers want to make it into a story of supernatural happenings in all parts of the country.
