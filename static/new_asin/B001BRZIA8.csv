8284439,5,B001BRZIA8,"This series has been amazing and as a lifelong 49er fan, I've got a bias toward all 5 that have been done on the 49ers.  The insight from George Siefert, Jerry Rice, and Tom Rathman is poignant, revelatory, and hilarious at spots.  The extras feature some narrative that wasn't in the original airing and certainly adds some extra spice.  I think any fan of the NFL would love this!!",1359331200,,383,4.521739130434782
