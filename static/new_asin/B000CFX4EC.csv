8098828,2,B000CFX4EC,"The best part about the dvd is that it is a 50 minute class including the 3 minute savasana.  That is the perfect length class for my taste.  The practice had some potential.

However, I feel awful at how much I disliked it.  The cover is misleading because the class is not shot outside, nor does it have any scene resembling a beach or Maui.  It is shot inside some room with only Darin Chandler, ""The Guru"". Apparently, Guru means something different in his vocabulary.  I think I'll be a Guru.  But I digress.  The filming is strange at times and sort of blurry, but I feel like it might have been on purpose.  There's too many other negatives for me to dwell on this so I'll move on to the other issues.

He opens with a statement about this being an intermediate level class.  Perhaps there are a couple of intermediate moves, but I do not find it to be intermediate.  His balance pose was basic tree, which is hardly intermediate.  There is NOTHING truly difficult or unique about this dvd either.  There is no twisting except twisting triangle and a final floor spinal twist.  There are no crane/crow, headstand, shoulder stand, plough, bridge, wheel, etc., yet there is nothing new here either.

Chandler does the practice while instructing it.  His form is strange in certain poses, particularly the one he calls awkward (aka chair).  His speech is monotone and heavily rushed.  More importantly to some, might be that because of his rushed speaking, this is not a calming dvd.  He also jumps back to chaturanga pretty heavily.

Something about Chandler reminds me of Bryan Kest, who is also annoying.  Perhaps it was his constant exaggerated strange sigh-like breathing or some of the wording or that the only move I liked was also used by Kest.  I'm not sure, but nonetheless Chandler is not a great instructor.  FYI, although Kest is annoying, I found his workouts to be good enough to keep me interested.  I will not be doing Chandler's again.  He didn't give much postural cueing at all until 20 minutes in.  He also messed up a couple times on cueing which leg to use and they did not edit that out.  I also wanted to hit the television every time he used the word ""doggy"".  And it was a LOT.  You should not want to hit during yoga.  Again, I feel so bad to speak such bad things about this dvd, but I had high hopes and was so disappointed.  Some minor things could have been forgiven, but add it all together and you can put that money toward a different dvd.

The fact that he graduated Bikram Chaudhury College of India proves that he spent a whole bunch of money.  I hope this dvd is not the most accurate representation of a Bikram graduate.  Sorry Darin.  Maybe next time record the speaking after so you can watch what you are doing and try not to say so much so fast.",1321315200,,2793,4.472222222222222
