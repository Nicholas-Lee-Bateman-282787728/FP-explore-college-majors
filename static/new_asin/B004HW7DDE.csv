8653189,3,B004HW7DDE,"Three stars because this is definitely not for everyone.  I assure you, however, that if you love to make fun of bad movies that know they're bad and if love movies that purposefully ignore the politically correct nature of the mainstream media, then you'll love this movie.

Personally, I laughed loud and often, only to find myself cringing a moment later (asking myself why they would ruin a ""good"" bad movie by including a certain scene or line, then asking myself what I expected from a movie titled Hamlet the Vampire Slayer).

Like I said, not for everyone, but it might be for everyone that finds themselves intrigued by a movie that mixes a Shakespearean classic with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Bring It On.  Let's be honest here folks, if you're buying a movie like this, are you expecting quality or are you expecting an hour of laughing at how bad it is?  Just saying...",1424908800,,884,4.641025641025641

So if you want to have a detailed (and very funny) review of ""Hamlet - the Vampire Slayer"", you should probably check out their video on [...]. It's brilliant!!

So here's the plot of this ... very, very strange movie:
It's a crossover between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Hamlet. And ... that's pretty much all there is to say. Hamlet is a cheerleader (so is Laertes), his new step-father/uncle Claudio is a vampire he has to slay, and even Othello and MacBeth get minor roles as Hamlet's slayer-friends. Oh, and then they play basketball.
One of the hightlights: Hamlet's monologue, startig with: ""To slay, or not to slay, that is the question""... maybe that's the only reason they made this movie at all. So they could use this line!

It's absurd. It's bizarre. It's made with no budget.
And it's a lot of fun to watch! Especially the soundtrack is surprisingly good!

So if you like cheap, bad movies that don't take themselves too serious you should check out this movie (and the deleted scenes). Grap some beer, pizza and some friends and enjoy the terrible, terrible movie that Hamlet the Vamipre Slayer is. I certainly did!",1359417600,8,1228,4.755868544600939
