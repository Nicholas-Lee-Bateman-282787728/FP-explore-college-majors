956081,1,6305020868,"Even though Tsui Hark is one of my favorite Hong Kong directors, this movie did not at all show his skill. The story was poor along with the actors performances. I may be a little biased since I love John Woo, and  Tsui Hark killed their friendship by making this movie. Worth checking out  but i wouldn't buy it if I were you.",950832000,5,327,4.174603174603175
956082,2,6305020868,"If you expect another shootout-fest like ABT2, you're in for a big disapointment. Tsui Hark took over from Woo alright, but unfortunately he overdid the family values thing. This overlong film is more Drama than  Action. That would be OK for any other film, but definetely *NOT* for the  ABT series. If you want to see Yun Fat kick major behind in Vietnam, chose  the superior ""Bullet In The Head"". And btw, Tsui Hark did much  better with ""Peking Opera Blues"". Come to think of it, this is  probably his worst movie ever as a director. Still, it is not a bad film,  but 25 minutes too long and somewhat overwrought.",947980800,2,616,4.504504504504505

7881540,3,6305020868,"As a big fan of the first two films in the series, I had been wanting to see Tsui Hark's A BETTER TOMORROW III for a while.  I had mixed expectations for the film.  I'd heard that it wasn't too good, that the series was nothing without John Woo.  But I was also very intrigued by the storyline and the fact that the film was a prequel.

The film is set at the end of the Vietnam War.  Young Mark Gor (Chow Yun Fat, reprising his role from A BETTER TOMORROW) travels to Saigon to bring his cousin, Mun (Tony Leung), and his uncle back to Hong Kong.  Once there, Mark finds Mun - and everyone else - caught up in the war, forced to involve themselves in shady underworld crime.  As Mark is drawn into the criminal underworld, he meets Chow Ying Kit (Anita Mui), a beautiful gangleader who quickly grows close to Mark and Mun.  Though both Mark and Mun are in love with Kit, Mun realizes that she loves Mark and lets him have her.  Just when it seems their problems are solved, along comes Kit's old flame, criminal lord Ho Cheung Ching (Tokito Saburo).

Everyone knows that Tsui Hark, though a talented director, is nowhere near as skilled as action master John Woo.  Under the direction of John Woo, action sequences seem beautiful, almost like dancing; under the direction of Tsui Hark, they seem dull and hokey.  Though Hark fails to make A BETTER TOMORROW III's action sequences interesting, he does a fine job with the dramatic/romantic scenes, of which there are many.  Anita Mui and Chow Yun Fat are both talented actors, and they each perform very well.  The script lags just a little at times, but for the most part, it's very well-written.  The best parts of the film were the ""origin"" scenes, explaining how Mark Gor became the super-cool killer he was in A BETTER TOMORROW - Mark getting his sunglasses, Mark getting his trenchcoat, Mark becoming hardened from all the violence.  I would've liked to see more of those.

As a sequel, A BETTER TOMORROW III is rather weak, but it's not such a bad film.  It's a poor action film, but an intriguing romance-drama.  Fans of the first two films should give it a shot.",1150761600,2,2121,4.4765625
7881541,5,6305020868,"I purchased this film hoping for an action film along the lines of the first two entries in the series.  What I got was an epic love story set during the waning days of Saigon.  And I liked it!  The emotions in this film are real and the response to the them are earned.  As a fan of the John Woo films I hate to say it but the gunplay in this film interfered with the human interactions.  As a Chow Yun Fat fan I was really impressed with the range he displays here.  Instead of the brash cowboy he played in the first two films he shows, gasp, vulnerability.  And what can you say about Anita Mui: beauty, brains, brawn, and charisma.  A perfect capper to a terrific series of films.",1132012800,2,685,4.136363636363637
7881542,4,6305020868,"As a fairly big Chow Yun-Fat fan I'd have to say this is my least favorite. I think it's a lack of John Woo. The story never really caught my attention like the first two. Even thought there was more of a love sceen for Chow Yun-Fat, I don't think it showed enough of his passion as did this first one, or even the second one. if you have the first two, or even one you have to buy this movie, just to keep the collection together.",1028678400,2,431,3.9655172413793105
7881543,5,6305020868,"I OWN ALL OF THE BETTER TOMORROW SERIES, ANY CHOW YUN FAT FAN WOULD NOT OWN JUST ONE, THEY FIT TOGETHER, BUT BETTER TOMORROW III IS MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE.  THERE IS A GREAT LOVE STORY, QUITE UNLIKE 1 AND 2(THOUGH THEY ARE REALLY GREAT MOVIES). ONE OF CHOW'S BEST PERFORMANCES. THE LAST SCENE OF THE MOVIE HAS ME IN TEARS NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WATCH IT.  A MUST HAVE!!",1014940800,5,375,4.123287671232877
7881544,3,6305020868,"Now, better tomorrow series made people all over asia bowing down to chow yun fat as he played as mark. a smooth, laid back gangsta cappin everyone...
However, this one was the worst out of the series. unique storylines.....but actions were so weak, it's like chow yun fat's old movies has more actions and better storylines...
but stil...u gota respect better tomorrow series...they are true classics",1007337600,,401,5.090909090909091
7881545,5,6305020868,"This was by far the best film of the series and Anita Mui has never been better. Let's face it folks, we don't buy these films because of the story, the great philosophical message it conveys, or the Oscar worthy performances. Get over it guys....this was a great action flick that should please Anita Mui fans. It's one of the few roles she's had that lets her strut her stuff and she dominates the film.",973209600,9,405,4.413333333333333
7881546,4,6305020868,"well, its chow yun-fat, yes its a part of the better tomorrow series, but no john woo,  tsui hark did a decent job directing but held off to much of the action and has action, chow yun-fat/john woo/fans hungry for more.  The  entire movie was a romance, which is alright, but when you mix chow yun fat  and a better tomorrow, you get a good story which you got in this movie but  you miss the playfull aspects from a john woo movie.  Its a good movie but  it doesnt get all five stars for missing john woo",953251200,,505,4.091836734693878
