1697824,2,B0000640U9,"Eighteen years after the original movie comes this overlong (over two and a half hours), overblown sequel. Set ten years after the first film ends, pyrokinetic teen Charlie McGee (Margueritte Moreau) is now working as a librarian and is aiming to get her life back together. But unfortunately for her agents are still pursuing her and she finds herself having to trust one of them (Malcolm McDowell) and a loopy professor (Dennis Hopper- who else?) in order to survive. The story is nothing great, but I won't be spoiling anything if I say there are lots of explosions. Pity the rest of the movie isn't explosive.
I found FIRESTARTER 2 to be slow, long and just not very interesting. The film makers (poorly) recreate scenes from the original film for flashback sequences, this doesn't work. Hopper and McDowell deserve far better than this. Moreau gives a good performance too, and for that reason this partially redeems FIRESTARTER 2 from 1- star hell.",1043107200,5,954,4.895061728395062
1697825,3,B0000640U9,"Don't get me wrong, this is no great piece of art, but it's an entertaining and generally well-made attempt to continue the ""Firestarter"" storyline.  Heck, it's better than the first ""Firestarter"" movie, though it can't hold a candle (no pun intended) to King's novel.  Taken on its own terms, though, it's an agreeable enough way to spend a few hours.  Wish the DVD had a commentary so we knew some of the creative teams' thoughts.",1041984000,,432,4.733333333333333
1697826,1,B0000640U9,"Firestarter#1 was a very cool movie but this one change and ruin the whole story, cast and special effects from the fisrt movie.
""WHY?""
Because:
1- The acting was HORRIBLE! except for the girl who played Charlie.
2- The storyline was GARBAGE!
3- The story was changed a lot.
4- The special effects were TRASH! (worst than the movie SPAWN and Mortal Kombat II).

1697827,5,B0000640U9,"Firestarter 2 is an entertaining movie.  Although it does not live up to the expectations of Stephen King fans, you must remember that Stephen King had nothing to do with the movie...
Charlie is a grown up now and we should expect her to do grown up things, not just run and cry when life doesn't go her way.  The characterization is great.  The first part of the movie, she is working in a library and goes to clubs to find male companionship with no strings attatched.  What would you expect from someone who has lost everyone she loves and fears loving anyone else for the risk that she may lose them.  I am giving this five stars because the other critics are far too harsh.  It is a fun movie that the sci-fi channel did a good job with.  Rent it first if you like, but I'm sure you will want to add it to your DVD collection.",1026086400,6,831,4.188679245283019
1697828,4,B0000640U9,"After browsing through a few of my fellow critics reviews I need to say this, lighten up.  This movie is not that bad considering that it is a sci-fi channel miniseries style film.  For a movie that does not need to rely on saying things like (beep) or having tones of (sexual intercourse) that most sequels rely on they really pulled off a treat to the eyes.
I think the problem that most of my fellow critics had was the fact that they read the book, did not like the first film because it did not faithfully adapt to the book.  Who cares?  The first film was fine and the second one lived up to it's predecessor.
Malcom McDowl played a fine Rainbird as he did an excellent job just like George C. Scott did.  The new Charlie (what you expected Drew Barrymore to reprise her role) does a good job as the now grown up Charlie trying to survive as she is still being hunted.  Rainbird new plan of more experimented kids provides a deadly advisary for her and overall I would say this movie is worth seeing.
However like I said I am little more liberal with the way I see movies but I honestly think that if one was to give this half a chance they would enjoy it.  It is entertaining to watch to those who are willing to give it a chance.",1022544000,17,1237,4.194092827004219
1697829,2,B0000640U9,"After remarkable performances by some real actors and a compelling story line in the original ""Firestarter,"" this effort to use it as a kickoff for a sequel flops.  Hollywood never learns.",1016496000,5,188,5.064516129032258
1697830,3,B0000640U9,"Of this movie??  One reason why I gave this movie three stars instead of five is because I actually saw the original ""Firestarter"" with Drew Barrymore in the title role, it's just more of the same with someone else in the title role as the firestarter, only ten years later, supposedly.
Too bad what she did to hide from this government agency didn't work like she hoped it would.  In the end, ""Big Brother"" always finds people who hide.  Oh well, ten years of peace is better than no peace at all.
I hated Malcolm McDowell's character because on the one hand he put his ""prize creation"" aka Charlie McGee on a pedestal, telling the boys at the compound stories about her, then using what he knew about her to coerce her into using her gift of fire.  He had this sick fantasy about Charlie was to compansate for what he couldn't have.  John certainly didn't love her like a man should, but he was jealous of what she and her male helper had. You will have to watch the movie to see what I mean.
What really bothered me about the whole scene at the government compound was that the boys McDowell's character was rearing with their ""education"" was bad because they were 'little monsters' in a sense.  A good parental figure would make sure the child understands compassion and consequences.  The boys were not bad. They were just misguided. I don't like that he refuses to use females for his test subjects.  I think just about anyone can become unpredictable when they know something is up.
At least Charlie's parents made sure she knew what consequences were.  That scene where her father smacked her because she didn't want to stop the fire in the barn showed he cared about her and the people that may have been in there.  I am glad she didn't fall for any of McDowell's character's tricks.
I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are looking for something different.  The original movie is better.",1016064000,,1899,4.555882352941176
1697860,1,B0000640U9,"I love Firestarter, one of my favorite king books. The movie based off that book is one of my favorites. So when I saw the sequel I naively thought, sure I'll give it a try, how bad could it be? So SO bad. Almost indescribably bad. Scenes from the first film are inaccurately and poorly recreated - in sequels if there's not going to be continuity the general rule is to pretend the first movie didn't exist, and I really wish they had chosen that route. Rainbird is mysteriously still alive even though there is very little doubt that he was deader than dead (and in fact he had intended to die in that way - although that is vaguely referenced in a bastardized way in the sequel). The acting is bad, the plot is weak, and the twist even more terrible and ridiculous. Don't watch it. You'll never get that time back.",1411776000,,817,4.34640522875817
1697861,1,B0000640U9,i hoped this movie would be great inspite of the bad reviews its been getting but when they had it that she lost control when ever she wanted to have sex it lost me. I really didn't mind it didn't keep in mind what happened in the first movie because kings sequels seldom keep that in mind and its always a new movie.,1399939200,,317,4.0476190476190474

1697865,3,B0000640U9,"Marguerite Moreau gives a terrific performance.  While the entire story is really outstanding if you think about it, somehow this movie lacks the suspense that the original Firestarter has (even when you watch the original over and over).  This film is also messed up by including scenes that are laughably impossible, such as when Marguerite walks on boiling hot and melting asphalt in her high heel boots, without the boots melting. Also, Danni Nucci's boss, who is helping Malcolm McDowell, gets burned with a fireball, but then returns shortly afterwards in the same suit without any burns at all.  Ordinarily, I would give this film 2 stars, but Dennis Hopper is his brillant self as usual.  So, I added a star.",1370390400,,716,4.892561983471074
1697866,1,B0000640U9,"To everyone like me who loved the book Firestarter by Stephen King, and thought the original film adaptation of that book made in 1984 was decent; do yourself a favor and avoid this atrocity at all costs. Words cannot even begin to express how immensely awful this was. It diverges both from the book and the original film adaptation of Firestarter completely. With that aside, this would still be awful even if this had been an original movie. The character development was poor, the acting was dreadful, and the story itself was abysmal.

On another note, I think it is a bad idea to write sequels to stories other people have written. If the author is deceased, I feel that is fine as long as you know what you are doing and it would be in the author's best interest. However, if an author wrote an amazing story that had a ton of potential for a great sequel, and that author is still alive, it should be left to them to pick up where they left off. Stephen King, the author of the book Firestarter, is very much alive and well. Therefore I strongly feel it should have been left to him to write a sequel to Firestarter before anyone considered the idea of making a movie out of it.

The original Firestarter had a lot of potential for a great sequel to be made out of it. Unfortunately, this god awful movie probably turned Stephen King off completely from the idea of writing his own sequel to Firestarter the way it should have been written. As a result, he probably will never pursue that idea. It's a damn shame, but oh well. There's no way to turn back time and prevent this from having been made, so all I can do really is let everyone else know how terrible this was so they do not experience the pain of having to sit through this abomination like I did.",1362182400,,1767,4.367781155015198
1697867,3,B0000640U9,"This mini-series falls far too short of being a sequel and is more like a re-make of the original 1984 film. Which might be okay if it was done better and had a satisfying ending, but in this case, this movie goes pear-shaped in the last 20 minutes so that your jaw drops and all you can say is ""Huh!?"" as Charlie inexplicably goes over to the Dark side and starts killing people in an act that is as pointless as it is brutal. And to what end? Well, not much...

This movie is worth watching for the special effects, and the talented actors, but that's all. If you expect a satisfying resolution to the story of Charlie McGee, this is not quite it. But if all you want is a way to harmlessly kill a few hours, this is mostly painless. Get this movie only if it comes in a cheaper package deal with the original movie; but don't buy it if you are a Stephen King fan hoping to see how little Charlie McGee turns out as this would be a real disappointment and a let-down.",1346544000,2,969,4.154255319148936

If this movie was an hour shorter I would say its a okay time waster, instead its a very long tv movie that doesn't really go anywhere or explore much of anything new instead of having other children with different powers go after charlie, returning charectors that make not a bit of sense since they died in the first film. I wouldn't even call this a sequel, more of a remake or reboot as it doesn't continue with the events that took place in the first film, its like they disregarded it. they changed things about what happen in the first film and some things are the same. movie needed Drew Barrymore again and a better script.",1318291200,3,899,4.454545454545454

I don't care that they didn't use the same actors or clips from the original or anything, but they could have done a better job. The effects and music especially were laughable.

And i did  cause i loved it alot. Margurite Moreau was hot and played the part well.  I think it was as good as the first one.  Its a totally different movie though. really shouldnt be compared. Its a great comeback as well

 And it was a long  movie as well.  over 3 hours. The fire  parts were wicked and  they did it really well when she unleashes her pyrokinetic powers.  It  was a really intriguing movie.  has alot of great action , with special effects. even the showdown ending was great.

All and all it was really interesting but it's definately one of those movies that you can't get up and walk off for a second because then you don't know what is going on anymore.  I watched the movie on cable and they made this 2 hour movie last for a whole 4 hours and honestly I think that was just plan out unnecessary!!! Not to ruin it for anyone but... the ending is really disappointing and kind of predictable especially if you've watched any kind of horror movie EVER!",1081296000,,624,4.3247863247863245
1697886,4,B0000640U9,"Okay, this movie was made by the Sci-Fi channel so I'm not going to be so hard on them for not having the best script/special effects/story.  I'm just going to focus more on the entertainment factor.
Yes, I was a huge Firestarter fan.  I was a bit disappointed in the changes from the past during the flashback pieces... but the main story was still there.  But this is the biggest reason I did not give them five stars... diverting from the real story.
However, I did enjoy the entertainment value.  The idea of more children with unique abilities was fun... I wish they had shown more of these children.  A glimpse at Charlie's life as she was all grown up was interesting, as well as other characters from the Lot 6 experiment.
The only thing I did not like was the ending... but this is the story of Charlie so it should have been expected.  I'll leave it at that so I don't blow the ending for anybody.  But it somewhat disappointed me.
No, this wasn't as good as the original.  Of course, Stephen King wrote it and didn't have a hand in this, so of course it is better.  I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to turn it off it if didn't catch my attention well.  But I was entertained and I watched it to the end.  Overalll, I would say, ""Job well done, Sci-Fi Channel.""
Would I recommend it?  Maybe... if your expectations are high (don't expect a Terminator 2 type of sequel) then I would suggest skipping out on this one.  But if you are into a night (this is a long movie) of cheap entertainment, pick this up!",1067558400,,1523,4.339222614840989
1697887,1,B0000640U9,".....oh sorry, it was Stephen King rolling in his grave after seeing this awful mini-series/movie!
How anyone involved with this project can even sleep at night is beyond me.  Yes, I am a Stephen King fan, and yes I have read the original Firestarter novel.  The original Firestarter movie (Drew Barrymore) was reasonable - not fantastic, and not terrible.  However, after spotting this movie in the video rental shop, I decided to give it a try, even though it is only one of those ""based on the characters movies"".
I settled down to watch the movie, and my jaw just dropped and dropped and dropped with disbelief!  The main thing which destroyed any credibility the movie may have had was the complete lack of continuity from the first movie - it was like watching a completely different character story really.  firstly Charlie's mother died in a completely different way, and the biggest mistake....Rainbird coming back from the dead??  I'm sorry, I don't care what the cheesy dialogue about not being dead said, look at the original movie....Rainbird was D-E-A-D!!  By this time, I just had to giggle insanely at each completely unbelievable plot twist which was so inaccurate continuity-wise that the whole film turned into a comedic episode.  I mean, I know that they could not have the original Firestarter 1 actors in the flashbacks...but at least make the flashbacks actually fit the correct story/character history guys!!
I have to say that a lot of the Stephen King ""based-on"" movies (i.e. ones not directly involving Stephen) are patchy to say the least, but if you are a fan of the original, then I have to say stay WELL CLEAR of this laughable attempt to ruthlessly cash in on Mr King's original idea, you'd only be encouraging them to do more.....",1056153600,8,1763,4.8533333333333335
1697888,3,B0000640U9,"Ok, so I watched this movie today and it was actually better than I expected. Longer too ~2hr 45mins which is something to rival Star Wars.
I also managed to see the original movie again a couple of weeks ago (after first seeing it years and years ago). What was most noticable to me were the flashbacks to the past which were so different to what was in the original movie. Ok, I don't mean not using any of the original actors like Heather Locklear or Drew Barrymore (like they would do this kind of movie now anyway) but the way the parents died, for example, was completely different to the way it was portrayed in this movie.
It was also sad how John Rainbird had developed his own personal little army which would eventually lead to a gigantic showdown btwn Charlie and the young ""gifted"" boys. I did however like the young guy who was helping Charlie through the majority of the movie. It's always nice to have someone you can trust who won't just run away when they learn the truth about you - as frightening as that can be. Too bad things didn't go as he or Charlie expected in the end.
I think the girl who played Charlie did a pretty good job but it's a bit of a shame that they didn't use the bits from the first movie as the flashback sequences. However, seeing they inserted some extra footage in the flashback scenes that weren't in the original movie it's understandable that they would need to use other actors to play those roles. Of course the special effects - including sound - were much better in this movie. Not surprising since the first movie was done 18 years ago.

7960170,3,B0000640U9,"I had no clue that this movie/mini-series even existed? Flipping around Netflix I stumbled onto it, and figured it was a remake of the Drew Barrymore film, so I popped it on. I didn't realize until it started rolling that I was looking a 3 hour film viewing. Apparently this was a mini-series for the SyFy channel back in the early 2000's, that most likely explains why it flew under my radar. As a big Stephen King fan, I'm usually on top of any made-for-tv or theatrical films made which are based on his work. But once SyFy canceled MST3K, they kind of dropped out of notice.

""Firestarter 2-Rekindled"" is a remake in a way, but it falls more into the sequel territory. They do re-tell the McGee's story through flashbacks, and the expand a bit about what the Shop was doing with Lot 6, so if you aren't familiar with the original film or King's novel, you can get caught up to speed pretty quickly. As this film opens though Charlie is in her 20's and has been hiding from the various agencies and people that want to study/capture her. A young man who thinks he's tracking down people to help settle an old lawsuit has inadvertently been tracking down the survivors of the old Lot 6 experiment, and he manages to track down Charlie. John Rainbird, the assassin from the first film survived the events of Charlie's run-in with the Shop, and he's expanded his role to caring for several ""special"" children, each with a unique power or ability. Rainbird wants to use Charlie to demonstrate the abilities of his new children.

While not exactly good, ""Firestarter 2"" isn't horrible either. The cast is really good with Dennis Hopper & Malcolm McDowell chewing up scenery. The F/X are about on par with your typical SyFy film, lots of CGI flames, but again it's watchable. The story is also kind of fun as it plays out like ""Firestarter vs. X-Men Babies"". The film lacks any real punch or excitement, but it never really drags either. I would say give it a view if you have nothing better to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but doubt I would buy the DVD for repeated viewings.",1433894400,,2076,4.533333333333333
