7853244,1,6303854397,"This is a great serial but very distracting to watch the way it is presented here. On the whole I'd say this release is fatally flawed and not worth your dime. Fortunately there is a better version it turns out, just not easy to find!  A friend loaned me a version put out by The Serial Squadron, who makes a lot of high quality serials. I have to say, it's far superior and the one you want to get. For one thing the episodes are presented on two DVDs instead of one. Why is that so important? Well, the amount of artifacts visible in this VCI release is quite noticeable, especially if you are projecting off a video projector they become quite awful. Also the restoration effort by Serial Squadron shows quite a bit more degree of work, thought and effort than this one which I think it's safe to say, did not have much if any noise reduction or clean-up. Yes it is true I don't see the Serial Squadron version for sale on Amazon, not sure why, but believe me it is worth your time to locate it.",1501804800,,998,4.252631578947368
7853245,5,6303854397,"""Tailspin Tommy in the Great Air Mystery"" is a 1935 Universal serial, sequel to the ""Tailspin Tommy"" serial, with Clark Williams, Jean Rogers, Pat O'Brien and Noah Beery Jr., directed by Ray Taylor.

This time, while Milt Howe (Pat O'Brien) is off in the mountains working on a mysterious invention, Tommy and Skeeter have been hired by Betty Lou's uncle, Ned Curtis (Bryant Washburn) to do a survey for an oil pipeline across the mountains of Nazil, an island somewhere in the Pacific.  Arriving late, they miss the departure of the dirigible carrying Ned Curtis, Betty Lou and her friend, Inez Casmetto (Delphine Drew) daughter of Curtis' partner, Don Alvarado Casmetto (Harry Worth).  The dirigible is wrecked, but Tommy and Skeeter assist in the rescue.  They eventually get to Nazil, where Don Alvarado's no-good brother Manuel (Herbert Heywood) and associate Horace Raymore (Matthew Betz) are trying to take over the oil fields, attacking from the air.  Fortunately Tommy is aided by a mystery flyer, known as ""El Condor"" in an eagle-motif airplane that can suddenly appear, or vanish.

This serial is less-episodic than the original Tailspin Tommy of the previous year, though it is still played in an intentionally cartoon-like manner.  There is a spy, Garcia (Paul Ellis) whom Don Alvarado thinks is a friend, and another, newspaper reporter and ""comic relief"" Bill McGuire (James P. Burtis) in the enemy camp as their cook, who gets Tommy and his friends out of several jams.  The plot wears a little thin, even with an active volcano and some unfriendly natives on a nearby island for variety, and footage of one of the air battles is recycled a couple times, so it is fortunate that there are only 12 chapters.  Probably owing to her best known role, in the Flash Gordon serial, Jean Rogers is a little hard to believe as Betty Lou Barnes, but she tries hard.  Clark Williams is fine as Tommy, and Noah Berry Jr. is as entertaining as he was in the earlier serial.  And Universal included some background music this time, fairly well integrated for a serial made in 1935.

VCI's edition, #8529 is on a single DVD.  VCI got the title wrong; ""and"" for ""in"" has been seen elsewhere.  Their notes also have the island as ""Nazi"" instead of ""Nazil"" -- computer spell checker at work?  But of importance, the chapters have decent image quality, well-framed, reasonably sharp and clean, with good contrast.  Some of the scenes have a little graininess, but this may have been in the original film.  The opening titles are not as good, with rather dark background pictures, and a smearing of motion apparently from ""averaging"" frames to make the image look ""cleaner.""  Fortunately this was done only in the opening credits.  VCI's sound is clear, though restricted in high-frequency content, probably due to noise filtering but while a small amount of ""hiss"" can be heard in the quiet parts -- and there aren't too many of those -- no disruptive effects have been added.  The opening titles include the Universal ""airplane circling the globe"" logo, and the restoration has been carefully done, though all show the same MPPDA certificate number.  A more serious problem, they have the absolute worst picture I've ever seen of Jean Rogers, but that's not the fault of the restoration.

If not quite as entertaining as the first ""Tailspin Tommy"" serial, it has a more-traditional format with a single story line, and the background music also helps.  Watched one chapter at a time, as should be done with serials, the plot holds up fairly well.  Another good release from VCI, reasonably priced.",1306108800,2,3595,4.904132231404959

7853247,4,6303854397,"Tailspin Tommy In The Great Air Mystery was made during a time when little kids really looked up to aviators.  It came along when people like Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart were capturing the hearts and imaginations of a Depression weary America, and it's dogfights and aerial exploits--in the first chapter alone Tommy hooks his plane on to a dirigible--couldn't have been better timed.

This was done when Universal was just getting used to putting out good sound serials.  It was a sequel to their earlier sucess TAILSPIN TOMMY and in many ways it's a better serial than it's predecessor.  After all, any serial with Jean Rogers is worth watching for her alone (even Adventures of Frank Merriwell!)!

Being an early Universal and a Public Domain serial, most prints of this are pretty miserable.  Thank God for the Serial Squadron, which has lovingly restored this serial.  The print is likely the best one you'll ever see (unless someone turns one up from the original camera negative).  The audio is hiss-free and the whole thing looks like it might have come out yesterday.  If you're a serial fan, this is one to add to your collection and put it proudly next to the Image Flash Gordon releases.",1169078400,11,1200,4.814634146341463
