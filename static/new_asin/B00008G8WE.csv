7983459,5,B00008G8WE,This is my favorite anime series EVER. The dvd came on time. It was still sealed and had the insert inside yet. I've never been so excited!,1379635200,,139,4.185185185185185
7983460,5,B00008G8WE,Brigadoon is a great anime. The story stays interesting and the main characters are all lovable till the end. Dubbed or Sub-titled this is one of Tokyopop's best animes. If you like alot of Mecha Drama and some cute comedy with hardcore action this one is definitly for you.,1146787200,4,274,4.612244897959184
