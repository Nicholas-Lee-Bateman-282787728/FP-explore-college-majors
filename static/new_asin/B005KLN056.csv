4717907,5,B005KLN056,This is a fantastic DVD made in his hometown where they never played with GNR. They do both Slash material and GNR material. Myles Kennedy is an excellent singer. Arrived before estimated delivery date. I suggest you pick up this DVD.,1338336000,5,234,4.7317073170731705

4717910,4,B005KLN056,"The band line-up for this concert recorded  July 27th 2011, at Victoria Hall, Stoke (England), was: Myles Kennedy - v; Slash - g; Bobby Schneck - g; Todd Kerns - b; Brent Fritz - d.

The set list is amazing and well distributed. Slash is at peak form. Myles Kennedy is an amazing singer, but his vocals tone may annoy some people. After all, a lot of Guns & Roses songs were recorded by Axl at very high registers (no wonder Axl lost all his voice by now), and to sins G & R tunes is not easy.

The back-up band is very competent and professional, as is the norm nowadays for top acts. Anything less than the highest proficiency will make the poor musician get replaced as fast as the blink of an eye.

A very good DVD, you will not want to skip any song.",1334275200,,755,4.115646258503402

4717921,5,B005KLN056,"I saw plenty of reviews, some of them warning us about the region of the product, that some Blu ray players may not play it.
I was very concern of this product whether playing or not  on my PS4.
well if anybody else have the same question, there you go.
It does play it on the ps4 perfectly fine!
100% awesome blu ray!!!
I have both ""GnR"" (blu ray) which is basically Axl and a bunch of good musicians.
and now this one ""Slash"".
I tell you this, in my humble opinion, GnR is Slash!!!
with that being said, this is a must have concert!!!",1437091200,,536,4.104761904761904
4717922,5,B005KLN056,Came on time - What can I say - Its Slash at his best!,1430870400,,54,2.9285714285714284
4717923,5,B005KLN056,Loved this concert with slash with myles Kennedy I have seen it alot! Im glad I bought it,1427932800,,89,4.0
4717924,5,B005KLN056,"Slash truly great guitarist remember him in ""Guns and Roses"" well his led vocalist
Myles Kennedy truly great match. If you really like kick ass rock & roll these guys
deliver! Check it out! Slash new album is a must buy with 17 songs called
""World on Fire"" over one hour of music.",1427673600,,280,4.30188679245283
4717925,5,B005KLN056,"First, this Bluray played just fine on my US Oppo BDP-95.  I almost passed on this because of the region coding listed in the description.  No worries, it's fine.  I own this on vinyl as well and the DTSMA soundtrack is excellent.  If you prefer stereo the 2-channel LPCM audio option is also superb.  The video is great but priority one is the music and they nailed both the performance and sound quality.  These guys just ripped!  I'm jealous of everyone who was able to attend in person!",1423526400,2,490,4.5
4717926,5,B005KLN056,"What a great concert! Slash & Myles are fab together! If you like Rock-n-Roll, you'll love this vid!",1411430400,,100,4.611111111111111

4717939,5,B005KLN056,This DVD shows Slash at his best,1407715200,,32,3.7142857142857144
4717940,5,B005KLN056,"This DVD solidifies Slash's place in rock and roll AND guitar history, and probably makes Axl wish everyday he could kiss and make up with Slash!!! GNR was all Slash ... It is now completely obvious to anyone that watches this that Axl was just an ignorant, egomaniac singer that didn't give a hoot about anybody but himself ... and this DVD proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt. Additionally, Myles Kennedy shows us why he was Led Zeppelin's first choice to replace Robert Plant for the failed tour following their reunion show at the O2 in 2007. GREAT show ... GREAT DVD ... GREAT playing and singing .. and unbelievable band.",1403395200,,628,4.566371681415929
4717941,5,B005KLN056,"Awesome live show!!! One of the best live DVDs I've ever watched!!! Worth every cent!!! & Myles is a great singer!!! From all the GNR stuff to Velvet Revolver , & snakepit & all the newer stuff!!!",1399680000,,196,4.324324324324325
4717942,5,B005KLN056,I mean honestly do you expect anything less than greatness? I will point out though if you are into a lot of the concert on DVDs/Blu Rays like I am the crowd here doesn't have the energy I would expect at a slash concert. I almost wonder if the crowd was given a talk to before the show saying to keep it down and not get out of hand for the recording. Over all though to the  band great performance! Crowd just sucked imo.,1392249600,2,423,4.035714285714286
4717943,5,B005KLN056,"I can't understand why this isn't available as a US item and in stores?  It must be a legal deal as this is a terrific set of songs and Slash is in amazing form with his Les Paul alternately singing and snarling and Myles is a very consistent and worthy lead vocalist.  We have a 2 hour full show , a career defining set and a serious bonus interview.  Of course I recommend this to fans of Slash, but goodness, any music fan who enjoys KICK A** Rock should be in heaven as this group Is caught on a great night in a cool venue, filmed better than most concert DVDs and featuring great sound.  As I said in the title, this does play in the USA without a problem as does the matching DVD... so do not worry that it is region encoded or PAL.",1390953600,,739,4.041095890410959
4717944,5,B005KLN056,"I seen Slash on this tour in Kansas city. The show I saw was even better then this one. That being said, this is still a fantastic representation of what Slash and his band sounded and performed like on this tour. I would say better then GnR did back in the day.",1386979200,,262,4.0576923076923075
4717945,5,B005KLN056,I first watched this concert on hdnet  just knew i had to buy it on blu ray this inconcert on dvd is freaking  AWESOME both video & sound quality slash & myles f'n rock ! well worth the $ of the blu ray ..,1378425600,3,205,3.6363636363636362
4717946,5,B005KLN056,"This was a totally awesome Blu-Ray!  The clarity was awesome but as far as Slash and his performance, he knocked it out of the park along with his Conspirators.  Along with Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge on vocals, you couldn't tell sometime whether it was Myles or Axl Rose up there singing (although Myles does a much better job).  I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray to anyone that is a fan of Slash and/or Myles Kennedy.  It was great!",1378252800,,442,4.556962025316456
4717957,5,B005KLN056,Great show and selection of songs Myles delivers and the whole band rocks hope he does another Dvd of his more recent songs.,1370822400,,124,4.434782608695652

All the songs were great......the band is spot on, singer is dynamite and the crowd is definitely into it! Love the coming back to his hometown angle! If you love GNRs , Slash and VR get it what a five star concert! The confetti was a nice touch! DTS 5.1 is very crisp and puts you in the center of the concert!",1363132800,,398,4.050632911392405
4717960,5,B005KLN056,Recorded in his hometown and features Miles Kennedy on vocals.  First saw it on TV so I had to own it!,1363046400,,102,3.857142857142857
4717961,5,B005KLN056,"Slash, Myles and the band rock the house like it should be done by true rock'n'rollers. Raw power, excellent music and well directed. Anybody who loves rock should get it and play it loud!",1357516800,,188,4.5588235294117645
4717962,5,B005KLN056,"The concert is excellet!!! The songs are the best since some great hits like Night Train for all whom enjoy hard rock. I would buy it again for sure!! It does not contain songs from last Slash album Apocaliptic love, only previous albums but Im sure you won't regret buying it.",1357257600,,277,4.450980392156863

4717964,4,B005KLN056,If you realy like Slash's stile you can't go wrong bying this DVD Made in Stoke. He was playing a lot on this DVD and the vocals are much better then his old band Guns and roses.,1351900800,,178,3.8378378378378377
4717965,5,B005KLN056,"This will go down as my top 5 all time favorites. The music is ""EXCELLENT""! This is SLASH at his best and Myles Kennedy is second to none. I'm a 70's/80's rock music lover and have about anything you could think of. For the last fifteen years most of the music I've bought is ""Live"" be it CD/DVD so this was a welcome new comer to my collection. It's starting to get tough to find what I call good ROCK. This DVD is the one to have. After all, who needs an Axl when you have the Wheel #Myles Kennedy#................Truly awesome!",1344038400,,530,4.257425742574258
4717966,5,B005KLN056,"I just wanted to add to the other posts that this did play in my U.S. basic blu-ray player as well.  The blu-ray UK version is region free and is the full concert.  Took about a week to arrive and worth it, looks great and has all the concert songs - quite a full song list.",1341273600,,274,3.875
