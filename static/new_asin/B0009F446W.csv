8060034,5,B0009F446W,"I started dancing with Azar back in 1996, in Mt View, California. We danced without mirrors for the first few years, so we could really learn to dance by feeling the movement. I danced in her troop, Mystic Sun Dancers, for about a decade. I later attended other classes in the Bay Area with different teachers, but Azar has always been my favorite. She's a wonderful beginners' teacher. She is extremely knowledgeable of the different movements and also of the history of belly dancing too. I had some of the best times of my life in Azar's fun classes.

After many years of not dancing, my two neighbors and I have decided to pick up dancing at home to try to get back in shape and I bought this video to help them learn the basics. We have such a good time, almost reminds me of the hay days......

I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to begin some of the best workouts for your body. Enjoy!",1389052800,,894,4.379518072289157
8060035,2,B0009F446W,"I have seen several different bellydance videos and I was very disappointed and uninspired with this one.  Nothing against Azar, I'm sure she is a very nice person and I did feel as though she was very familiar with dance per se, but I don't think bellydance is quite her thing.  The first thing I usually do with a new video is watch the performance given by the instructor.  I feel you can tell a lot about this... if the performance is good, I feel positive knowing that this same person is helping me to learn as well.  As soon as I saw Azar's performance I knew we were in trouble.  I'm sorry to say this but her dancing was not good at all, in my opinion.  It seemed jerky with no fluidity or flair, I hate to say the word ""sloppy"" as I saw in one review, but it does seem to fit.  I felt that my eight year old daughter could have done a better job to be quite honest.

The setting looked like she had put a few eastern-type things in an apartment somewhere and the whole video felt like she was having it filmed by a friend or relative, very low-budget.  Again, I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but this is my honest review of it.

I did pick up a few pointers on some things here and there for the footwork, but she moved too fast to really follow unless you already knew what you were doing, and there were little to no real instructions given.  I did most of the video, hoping I would find some redeeming quality to it, but finally around cool-down time I just said ""the heck with it"" and turned it off... I couldn't stand watching any more.  I rented this and am very glad I didn't waste my money on it.

I would *not* recommend this, even for beginners.  My first bellydance video was Veena and Neena's Basic Moves and that was a wonderful first introduction, one that I would be confident recommending to anyone.  I have done several of their other videos as well, also a Kelli Marie video.  Veena and Neena are so far the best that I have tried.  Kelli Marie was good in a different way and a bit slower, but this one by Azar I would have to give two thumbs... down.

If you are looking for an intro to bellydance, this one might give you the wrong impression and make you decide it wasn't that great after all.",1197331200,2,2225,4.195294117647059
8060036,3,B0009F446W,"First I would like to state that the best part of this DVD is Azar's attitude. She's very friendly and encouraging and spends a lot of time smiling at the viewer through the TV. If not for her outstanding friendliness, I would rate this DVD a 2 or lower. She's fun to dance with, much, like another reviewer has said, like dancing with a close friend.

But she really doesn't explain the moves clearly enough. My father's family is Armenian Lebanese, so I've grown up with belly dancing and was able to pick up most of what she was doing... But her explanations of how she does things aren't particularly helpful. For example, I have no idea how she manages to do carousel turns. She does attempt to explain them briefly, but the explanation is not clear and several of her explanations have that same deficiency.

If you want a dance workout and aren't particularly worried about the accuracy of your moves (for example, if you just want to have fun working out in your living room), this is a pretty good DVD. But if you're at all interested in dancing in front of anyone, I wouldn't recommend this DVD.",1172534400,4,1105,4.52
8060037,5,B0009F446W,"This DVD is beautifully done. Compared to other videos, the sound and image quality was great. Perfect for the beginner or those looking for a fun way to exercise.",1160092800,,163,4.655172413793103
8060038,3,B0009F446W,"This is a mid production dvd with just some chapter options of intor, alignment, workout & performance. It looks set in someone's large living room complete with only eastern & Indian decorating that is beatuiful with hard wood floors.
Azar's starts with a 1 min intro & 2 mins on basic posture which you can get on any bellydance fitness dvd.
I started at the end with her 4 min performance & it wasn't very inspiring. She is self conscious, almost like she wants to look at her own back & the moves themselves seem a bit sloppy. What got me the most is she wears HIGH HEELS. I've never seen any other bellydancer do that. You can tell she loves to dance & natural beauty in her, but she doesn't allow it to come through from worry. I almost wanted to return it right then & there, but willing to give the workout a shot.

The camera stays mostly so far away, you can fit from her head to toe (good) but it's too far away, I don't need to see the floor & walls that much. She does have a very natural slloowww sensual movement, though a bit lazy w/no passion & her face reminds me of Susan Sarandon with a straight red hair & bangs that looks almost exactly like the bellydancer Jillina (who has great routine bellydance videos.)

The warm up is only a few head stretches, shoulder rolls & modified  yoga triangle that stretches the hips & side torso.
She narrates over over the video of herself alone showing you the steps. She only here & there gives a few clues on how to do the moves, otherwise ONLY calls out the name of the move. I almost wanted to say that is NOTHING on here for anyone, but realized she does bring out the relaxed side of you to just enjoy the dance. I would suggest this DVD only for those who have several bellydance dvds & are very used to the moves & looking for something that doesn't always stop so much to teach. Do not follow her movements since she is sloppy, but just like working out with a friend.

What moves included on the workout are chest circles vertical & horizontal, hip lifts & hip drops, hip circles, hip & houlder shimmies, hip lift walks, infinity 8s, snake arms, uludations, grapevine, hip lift walking in circle, carousel circle (hip lift turning).

8060039,3,B0009F446W,"Cons:

- I have no rythme so, the video moves too fast. She doesn't demonstrate things clearly and slowly for you to get the hang of it without having to rewind all the time.

- When she demonstrates she doesn't do it for very long, if you need to see the video to practice you'll have to rewind a lot.

- The video quality seems to be very low almost home made.

- When she dances her feet are not always in the possition she tells you to use

- she looks too self conscious and awkward

- It's a very short video

- Though her dance at the end was very mediocre for someone studying the dance for so long. She doesn't have very good showmanship and looks awkward.

Pros:

- I like the way she explains some things but not all things are clear

- Music is good

- If I have nothing else it lays some of the very basic ground work I can work on and learn from watching others",1149724800,8,875,3.971264367816092
8060040,5,B0009F446W,"Good video production and sound quality highlights the excellent instruction found within this DVD.  Azar's teaching is very concise, easy-to-follow, and health-conscious, which makes this DVD fantastic for those interested in learning more about belly dance and want a good foundation in the basics, or those looking for a fun way to keep fit.  A delightful bonus is a performance by Azar at the end of the DVD featuring traditional style that's  sassy and elegant.  I bought this DVD for my baby-boomer-aged mom, knowing it would be safe for her to learn more about belly dance and a fun way to get a bit more exercise in her busy schedule. She wouldn't go to classes before, but now b/c of this DVD, she's willing to go!",1144540800,4,723,4.714285714285714
8060041,4,B0009F446W,Very pleasant music and easy does it gentle format makes for non-frantic stress free beginner level dance workout from IAMED. Azar gets 3 stars for her teaching because she confuses her ummies  with her hip cirles and has slight sway back posture that is a no-no for dancers with lower back issues. She is also not an inspired performer and comes across as rather banal. Other than a few minor things like that it is really nice dvd and a good value for the money.,1143504000,6,464,4.458823529411765
8060042,5,B0009F446W,"I wanted a workout and also wanted to learn how to belly dance.  Azar is definitely the answer!  Easy to follow, not too repetitious, but enough to learn the move and move on without getting bored.  I would recommend this to anyone who has never tried bellydancing and wants to learn the basic moves easily.  The music is great and there are links to suppliers! I'm checking out Azar to see what else she has to offer!",1129939200,13,418,4.3896103896103895
8060043,5,B0009F446W,I received this DVD as a gift.  I had never tried belly dance before and don't think that I would in a group setting.  Trying it at home was great for me.  I am able to get a good workout and have fun at the same time.  Azar seems so nice and her instructions are clear for a first timer.  I think that anybody of any age would enjoy this DVD.,1122336000,12,343,3.7746478873239435
