This documentary takes you through parts of the country that few have ever seen, let alone seen at the pace of a bike. You get a true since of the great people and landscape that makes up this great land of ours.

Through sharp and concise footage, supported by a wonderful soundtrack whose words lineup directly with the film can all the greatness of our land be captured on film. This film will inspire you to follow your dreams no matter what they are.

It is truly a remarkable film.",1117843200,4,714,4.281481481481482
2299362,5,B0009L4AA6,"""Share the Road"" provides a view of America you need to see.  Even if you're not a biker (I'm not), this is a road trip worth taking.  This documentary gives us a 60-mile- a-day rather than 60-mile- an-hour look at the American landscape, a pace at which, as one of the narrators says, ""You can find the real America.""  What a refreshing break from the fear-driven CNN this-just-in disaster reports we're pummeled with through the media.  I found ""Share the Road"" a genuine breath of fresh air.  The story is good.  The scenery is gorgeous.  The original soundtrack for this film is exceptional.  (They should release a CD with just the music.  Great stuff.)  If the spirit of freedom, fun, and adventure captured here doesn't stir you just a little - you might want to check your pulse.",1115856000,4,787,4.63768115942029
2299363,5,B0009L4AA6,"I had to get this after I saw their first documentary on hiking the Appalachain Trail, ""TREK"" .  That was amazing in and of itself, but they have gone leaps and bounds above that documentary in terms of production and presentation.  This truly engaging and inspiring DVD chronicles their bike trip all across the United States over the course of one summer.  They are a rare group of souls who truly follow their dreams, and have been courteous enough to share their adventures with the rest of us. I highly recommend this DVD. It makes me want to get out and see the world. You will be inspired!",1115683200,4,596,4.5

8062893,2,B0009L4AA6,"Like most, I bought this because I enjoyed their other film, 'Trek'. Well, 'Share the Road' isn't even close to as good as 'Trek'. Trek presented a clear storyline and did a good job of introducing the principle characters. Share the Road, however, does neither. For the most part 'Share the Road' is a lot of shots of riding bikes and post trip narration about how great it is to take time off from the daily grind.  There is almost no explanation of the landscape and the towns they go through, and only cursory discussion about who is part of the ride.

Because I want to support the guys from Circ, I am a bit conflicted about giving this film only two stars. But it really isn't worth more. The film is short, repetitive, and not worth watching more than once. At a price tag of $24 it isn't value for money.",1287100800,,813,4.342105263157895
8062894,4,B0009L4AA6,I saw trek about a month before my purchase of Share the Road. I was excited to see more from this group and enjoyed the video. Seem'd to lack the great detail that the trek video offered but still a good buy! I am ready to sell to the next viewer at this time.,1274918400,,261,3.8518518518518516
8062895,5,B0009L4AA6,Share The Road is a movie that should watched by all especially people that drive cars. Take a look at what the future holds for going cross country it shows what people miss on the road.,1202515200,,187,4.222222222222222
8062896,5,B0009L4AA6,"Great film about biking across the USA and seeing the good side that the news doesn't report. Very real and well done. You should also check out their film ""Trek"".
These guys aren't afraid to try the tough routes.",1202428800,,213,4.487179487179487
8062897,3,B0009L4AA6,"Share the Road is a documentary film about a brave and adventurous group of cyclists cycling across America. It is not a ""here is how to bike across America"" instruction book. The film presents itself as a diary for those who participated in the ride. Buy it for an appreciation of what the cyclists accomplished rather than a how to guide.",1168128000,,340,4.590163934426229
8062898,4,B0009L4AA6,"I bought this DVD last year expecting more of a documentary about loaded touring from an outsiders point of view.  Instead, the narration and storytelling is done by actual group members.  It gives you an inside view of the chemistry of a group as they go on a long journey by bike.  The way it is done, you sort of feel like you are a part of the group.

The scenery is incredible. It makes you anxious for the warm weather to return so you can hop on your bike and experience as much of the country as possible.  I say ""experience the country"" because that is what happens when you ride a bicycle rather than drive a car.  In a car, you are just trying to get somewhere. On a bike, you become a part of the journey, and that is one of the things these guys show you through their own journey.

I am planning my own journey/loaded bicycle tour along a portion of the same route for the Summer of 2006 and this film has definitely helped me through the long winter.",1142380800,3,965,4.183783783783784
8062899,4,B0009L4AA6,"This was a good film.  Makes me wanna go on a long distance bike ride.  However, it was not as well done as their first film, Trek.  Too short and it didn't seem to explore the participants as well as Trek (except for the 15-year old; his story had good depth and was interesting).  Overall, though, if you like long adventures, biking, or just have wanderlust, you should enjoy this film.",1134518400,4,389,4.436619718309859
8062900,5,B0009L4AA6,"The first time I viewed this was at the movie's original premiere. I was blown away, so I went up to the desk where copies were being sold and treated myself to having my own copy. It was definetly worth it.

Now I have watched this film several more times, and it never ceases to amaze me what these guys have managed to do. A bike trip like this would be something that I would like to do in the future, and this video gave me a reality check on what it would be like. Cirque has also improved greatly on their overall presentation. This movie just seemed to make me want to watch it more than their last release. This movie definetly deserves the 5 stars that I gave it. Keep up the good work, guys.",1123372800,3,702,4.124087591240876
