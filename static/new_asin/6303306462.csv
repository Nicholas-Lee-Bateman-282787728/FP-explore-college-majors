7843019,3,6303306462,"Jeff Wincott, the ultimate good guy of the 90s direct-to-video action scene, could only go so long without getting a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;derivative of his own, and it arrived in the form of ""Open Fire."" This is a fairly basic, serviceable genre flick with a martial arts edge, held back by select deficiencies of the action content but bolstered by the sheer presence of Wincott and villain Patrick Kilpatrick. Fans should pick it up quickly for their collection, but everyone else should consider it a rental.

The story: when a team of mercenaries overtakes a chemical factory as part of a scheme to free their incarcerated leader (Kilpatrick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown/dp/B000BNUFQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown</a>), only an ex-FBI agent (Wincott) who's trying to rescue his family can stop them.

Director Kurt Anderson had helmed some of Wincott's vehicles in the past (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Law-II-Undercover/dp/6302468035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Law II: Undercover</a>) to grand effect, but this one feels a bit less bombastic. Part of it has to do with the deficiency of standout character performances: Wincott is solid and Kilpatrick could play a decent villain in his sleep, but the surprising blandness of the script keeps any of the costars from shining either as characters or onscreen fighters. A potentially cool recurring feature is the villain's tendency to relay instructions to his subordinates via pre-recorded cassettes, but the screenplay doesn't get as creative with this as it could have. Then again, this isn't the type of movie you watch to be dramatically wowed, so I can't afford too much derision on these points.

Fight choreographer Jeff Pruitt did some of his best work with Jeff Wincott, and while the matches in here aren't among the best, they are for the most part pretty decent. There's more fighting here than I was led to expect, with some watchable brawls but also a few disappointing encounters. A lot of performers are haphazardly thrown around to entertaining effect, and the showdown between hero and villain is better than it probably has any right to be, but a potentially swell match between Wincott and B-movie tiger Leo Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/B006A8XFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>) fails to be half as good as it could have been. I'm not sure what went wrong, but if just a couple more of the seven matches were better, this one could have enjoyed a higher rating.

It's safe to say that at this point in his career, Wincott's best days as an action star were behind him, but both his effort and that of the filmmakers shines through, making for a thoroughly tolerable adventure. Don't expect this one to get a Region 1 DVD release any time soon, but don't let that keep you from enjoying it.",1405382400,2,3105,5.8628318584070795
7843020,5,6303306462,This is a great Jeff wincott movie a Great  early 90s martial arts flick acting isn't to bad either just wish it was on DVD though,1323302400,,130,4.0
7843021,3,6303306462,"I think Jeff Wincott is a teriffic and underated B-movie actor.  Of the Die Hard knock-offs out there, I was actually pleased to see he was in one of the films, hopefully making it more exciting than the others such as Don Wilson's Bloodfist 6:Ground Zero.  Open Fire does turn out to be better than Bloodfist 6, but I felt the script gave Wincott very little to expand on throughout the film.  The only we really get to explore about his charcater is that he is now an ex-cop after he accidently got his partner shot.  There are a few scenes of flashback and he dwells a bit on the subject, but not enough to add much sympathy - and not enough to explore his generally good acting skills.  What we end up seeing is basically, a typical Die Hard B-movie film.  Wincott beats up one guy after another, right up to the last fight against the boss.
The action is very average in this film.  There is more raw fighting and throwing bodies around rather than any forms of martial arts.  With that said, the action wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either, but does entertain, especially more then the action in say Bloodfist 6.  The terrorists were somewhat enjoyable, and not complete idiots like those in Bloodfist 6 either.  I liked Patrick Kilpatrick (Showdown, Death Warrant) as the boss, seeing that he can create a decent villain, as seen in some of his other films.  The final fight between Wincott and Kilpatrick is only less than 2 minutes, and not nearly as enjoyable as I was hoping.
Open Fire is slightly above average, and only gets a 3.5 just cause it is good to see Wincott again.  This is certainly not his best film, but I would argue that's not toally his fault.  The film is made a little better than others like it, but compared to ""The Die Hard"" this just doesn't have the same intelligence.",1194566400,2,1807,4.455927051671733
7843022,2,6303306462,Jeff Wincott the action-martial arts underground hero tries to imitate the DIE HARD legacy here in an all too familar terriotry with the same kind of villains i`ve seen countless times before. Wincott plays a former FBI agent who comes back to duty when he finds out his father has been kidnapped by terriosts and is held hostage in a chemical plant. High kicking action and mornic shootouts can`t possibly save this film from repeating the same action from previous film of the genre. And let`s face it Jeff Wincott is no Bruce Willis.,972604800,,536,4.712765957446808
