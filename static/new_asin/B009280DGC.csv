8534681,5,B009280DGC,"Will Rodgers is the greatest roper of all time.  His little movie is funny and a good family film.
The outtakes were especially entertaining.",1458345600,,141,4.875
8534682,5,B009280DGC,The Roping Fool has amazing roping with accurate commentary. I have watch several times and it never ceases to amaze me how accomplished Will Rogers was. I have purchased this same documentary on VHS twice and loaned to my friends who loaned it to their friends and it never found its way home. I have decided not to loan this DVD but refer people to Amazon to purchase their own DVD. It is money well spent!,1457481600,,408,4.381578947368421

8534685,5,B009280DGC,"I like Will Rogers. I like the roping tricks he does. I love seeing the old films.
This blast from the past had only one drawback, it was too short. It was filmed before the ""talkies"", but Will Rogers son does some narrating for us and explains the rope tricks, some of which I had never seen before.
 It wasn't just tricks, it actually had a story line, a real kick of an ending that made me laugh out loud, and some goof ups.
Just don't expect a lot of time on this film, unless you did like me and watched it again.",1386288000,4,518,4.029126213592233
