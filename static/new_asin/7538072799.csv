It lets me get a shower, do laundry or do some cleaning.  Works to calm him down when he's upset too (like when we have to come inside from the outdoors).  We only watch it once a day so it's still ""fresh"".",1020902400,,357,4.057142857142857

7899872,5,7538072799,"My daughter loved watching this video when she was little, and now my son (age 3) watches a LP video every day.

When this one got stepped on accidentally and wouldn't play anymore, my son begged me to get a new one, so I just HAD to replace it!  He was so excited when it came in the mail.

We have volulmes 1-4, and each one has great stories that teach life lessons too.  I'm not sure how my son can watch them over and over again, but he does and continues to love them!  I'm sure our third child will get much use out of them too.",1182470400,,535,3.9166666666666665
7899873,5,7538072799,"My kids love this video!  We originally received this tape as a promotional item from Pampers, I believe, several years ago.  My two older children watched it over and over until it finally wore out.  So, I was ecstatic to find another for sale here on Amazon that my youngest child could enjoy as well.  Having the music sung by Aaron Neville, makes the repeated playing of this tape much more enjoyable and tolerant for parents also.",1168732800,,435,4.6103896103896105

7899875,4,7538072799,"This tape is a promotional item that comes free with certain Fisher Price Little People toys accounting for its low used price. Still, this is a quality product featuring colorful claymation characters, Teletubbyesque visual effects/narration and musical interludes sung by Aaron Neville.

In the Little People's all-white neighborhood, Michael (black) and Sonya (Asian) are the most exotic of the characters. Michael is a shaman of sorts capable of animating his artistic creations. Sonya, who possesses the power to talk to the animals, is another in a long line of female Asian psychics (think Team America's Sarah or Ally McBeal's *****-psychic Ling). In comparison, blonde Eddie's strength is belief in himself while his sister Sarah's superpower seems to be feeling depressed.

The arc of each story is that the characters use their unique and sometimes fantastic gifts and ideas to solve a problem as a group. A narrator then tells the moral of the story. In the first episode, Michael helps to solve the strange problem of a farmer's wet corn patch by climbing up a rainbow and magnifying the power of the sun. The vague weirdness of each episode and disturbingly large hands of the characters are probably part of this video's Scandanavian charm (see the closing credits). And at the incredible low price of 1 cent per toddler-occupying minute, you can hardly afford to pass up this Amazon Marketplace value. Odd fact: the kids drive their own school bus.",1128729600,,1464,5.095833333333333
7899876,5,7538072799,"We have 3 of the Little People videos, Vols. 1, 3, and 4.  My 4 year old in particular is mesmerized by them all.  My 2 year old also likes them.  They are well made, with good animation and music.  Each video contains 5 short (5-minute) stories.  They sort of have a little ""lesson"" at the end, stuff like ""great things happen when you work together,"" but they're not preachy.  They're just clever little stories that the kids love.  Buy them all.",1125964800,,448,4.390243902439025
7899877,5,7538072799,My son Ryan is not a 18 month old that was interested in any tv program or video for that matter. But to watch the Little People is the light of his day. I came across this review and had to write to tell anyone who has a small child to get all the videos of the little people you can find. You won't regret it. These videos help you get them to relax. P.S. My 7 year old Drake also likes the videos.,1055462400,5,400,3.7738095238095237
7899878,5,7538072799,"My daughter loves these movies. She watches them over and over. They are great to help her relax before bed time or dinner. I would highly recommend the whole series, they have been a true blessing!!",1030924800,5,199,4.555555555555555
7899879,5,7538072799,"This video was free with my 20 month old's Little People Farm.  He loves it so much, we watch it almost every day.  When he is cranky or miserable, it never fails to cheer him up and make him laugh!  I have seen the whole thing (although not every day), and it is very cute and entertaining still for me!!  He recognizes the animals from his other Little People toys, and often interacts with them during the video.  I just ordered 2 other Little People videos from Fisher Price, and we are anxiously awaiting their arrival!!",1025827200,5,525,4.427083333333333
7899880,5,7538072799,"My 2 year old son loves this video; he call's it his ""Eddie Car"" video because he had the book of Eddie's Big Race first and he noticed that Eddie is in this video too.  He asks for it all the time and will sit there enthralled for the entire tape.  There are at least 5 different stories about the different adventures of the Little People characters that teach valuable lessons.  He's already learned a few new words just watching and listening to the little people.  The music isn't bad either, especially with Aaron Neville's singing.",1023062400,5,538,4.572916666666667
