8441839,5,B004UMWCA0,"The fantasy land of ""Herself The Elf"" was a popular 1980's cartoon, where you find Herself and friends up against evil..trying to take over. The characters are fun, cute, it was so popular even dolls were made of characters as well books. This should be on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!Unsure why it is taken so long. If you loved ""Rainbow Brite"",""The Smurfs"" etc..you will enjoy it...it is a childrens classic.",1307664000,,398,4.955223880597015
