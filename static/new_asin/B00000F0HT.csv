1199501,5,B00000F0HT,classic flick!  All the child stars from the late 70s early 80s I think were cast,1419638400,,81,4.0625
1199502,4,B00000F0HT,"Like most schools, Excelsior Union High School has clearly defined groups - the haves' and the have nots'. When Jay Jay(Michael J. Fox) , class clown & champion of the nerds falls for the girlfriend of the town(Nancy McKeon) aristocrat Beau Middleton(Anthony Edwards), Beau & his friends set out to ruin Jay Jay's reputation....

This comedy/drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade when it debuted for the very first time on NBC in the Fall of 1983.",1395187200,2,494,4.550561797752809
1199503,2,B00000F0HT,"I found out in another review that Poison IVY is the one I was looking for, if Amazon had another one to send out to me of this movie, I would have taken it instead of refund.  But luckily I got a refund, because the movie I actually remember with nancy mkeon and Michael j. Fox is Poison Ivy and it is not available and is better than high School uSA, Save your money...",1381276800,,371,4.013513513513513
1199504,5,B00000F0HT,"This movie brought back memories of my childhood.  NBC dominated made for tv movies during that decade.  This movie contained so many popular stars from the 60's, 70's, and 80's.  I highly suggest buying this if you're into the family friendly movie that always let's the good guys win.",1365897600,2,286,4.795918367346939
1199505,5,B00000F0HT,Very funny old classic movie. Very hard to find on DVD. Entire family enjoyed finding this on DVD. Good VHS replacement,1361145600,,119,4.714285714285714

1199507,5,B00000F0HT,"I love this movie, because it takes me back to one of the best decades ever, the '80s. I love seeing Michael J. Fox in his prime. I bought it because I absolutely love this movie and finally able to own it on DVD! I gave it this rating because I really love this movie!",1356739200,4,269,3.909090909090909
1199508,5,B00000F0HT,this is a movie that i've been looking for several years now. its excatly what i remembered it as.it was nice to see it on DVD,1345852800,,126,3.8846153846153846
1199509,3,B00000F0HT,"Michael J. Fox has always made light entertaining movies, although this is not one of his best. Seeing a young Anthony Edwards was a plus.
I enjoyed it.",1284854400,,152,4.464285714285714
1199520,3,B00000F0HT,"I remember when HIGH SCHOOL U.S.A. first aired back in 1983.  It was a big deal at the time to have a made for TV family movie (do they even do that kind of thing anymore?) that featured the young actors of that period starring alongside the young actors of yesteryear (or now, the year before yesteryear).  Jo, Kimberly Drummond, Willis Jackson, and Alex P. Keaton were the students and Gilligan, Dobie Gillis, Eddie Haskell, and Wally Cleaver were among the teachers/faculty/parents.  It was creatively written, though many of the gags were lame and corny even for back then.

I won't say it's not corny.  I won't say it's not embarrassingly lame in some parts.  I won't say it's not too silly for it's own good.  But I also won't say it's not fun.  Indeed, for all it's lameness and corniness, this is still a fun movie to watch.",1284076800,,832,4.5369127516778525
1199521,2,B00000F0HT,"It's very disappointing that the only home versions of the made-for-TVer HIGH SCHOOL USA (1983) are questionable ones. The VHS manufacturer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UNITED-AMERICAN-VIDEO/dp/B00000F0HT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UNITED AMERICAN VIDEO</a>, dubbed their product at SLP speed, the very slowest, and without HiFi audio. The few tapes I own from them have a crap picture, a bad hiss in the sound and major tracking problems.

As for the DVD outfit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRINITY-HOME-ENTERTAINMENT/dp/B0001WTVGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRINITY HOME ENTERTAINMENT</a>, their extensive catalog of skin flicks and slasher trash doesn't inspire me. After searching out reviews of their discs, I couldn't find anything specific to transfer quality, no raves or rants, yet I'm not prepared to plunge the necessary scratch to risk finding out if they are of better quality than UAE or not.

Is it fair to judge a home video outfit by their catalog? That's an individual choice. I gave this one a pass, for what it's worth.",1269475200,2,1132,6.54
1199522,5,B00000F0HT,"i grew up on this movie! i think i was like 9 or 10 wheni first saw it. it's hilarious! yea, it's cheesy, but that's what makes it so great.",1266019200,,140,3.7
1199523,4,B00000F0HT,"If you like the movie, then the DVD is great.  I enjoy Michael J Fox in his early movies. This is clean enough to show to students (no language or drugs or violence or sex.",1250380800,,172,3.914285714285714
1199524,3,B00000F0HT,"Crazy high school movie featuring 80's icons from NBC shows starring Michael J. Fox, Nancy Mckeon, Todd Bridges and Crispin Glover as geeks vs. preppies that has them at war with each other.  Not the greatest movie of all time but had its moments.",1241654400,,247,4.613636363636363
1199525,5,B00000F0HT,I was just confused by the DVD package that didn't at all relate to the actual movie. Everything else was great though!,1212451200,,119,4.454545454545454
1199526,3,B00000F0HT,"A good cast of 80's characters. Unfortunately, this movie belongs in the 80's.",1179273600,,78,5.076923076923077
1199527,5,B00000F0HT,"My older brother taped this off of TV years ago and it always became a running joke amongst myself and my siblings.  I was so excited to see it put onto DVD.  The movie itself is pure camp, but that it what makes it so enjoyable.  It is the epitome of 80's made-for-tv-movies with all the great stars of that time.  I highly recommend this for a laugh.",1135036800,4,352,4.132352941176471
1199528,5,B00000F0HT,"I had this movie on tape from tv probably close to 18 years ago...? Maybe that long...?  Anyway, I lost the tape of course and could never remember the name of this movie.  I was shocked to see this on Amazon for such a low price.  If you like 80's movies with pretty much every great 80's up & commers actors/actresses, buy this!!!  If you can't appreciate JJ Manners charm than why are you even reading this?",1107561600,3,410,4.285714285714286
1199529,1,B00000F0HT,This has got to be on of the worst movies ever made! I can't believe I wasted one and half hours of my life watching this trash. This movie needs to be taken off the shelves and thrown away. The only good part in the movie was when those two idiots in the movie totalled that piece of junk Trans Am. I do not recommend this movie to anyone!,1097280000,3,340,3.9420289855072466

7906082,4,B00000F0HT,"I finally saw this movie. Fox starred in 3 high school movies from 1983-4. This one, Class of 1984 and of course Back to the Future. Try watching all 3 in a binge session if you can. High School is perhaps somewhat forgettable. But nice to see Bob Denver and Dawn Wells in their roles. And if you were around then, wonder where all those years wandered to.

It depicted some customs now discarded, like the roller skating rink. Ah darn! Great fun. And the fluffed out hair on those girls. Courtesy of Farah Fawcett. Something that would endure till the end of the 80s.",1465430400,,568,4.40952380952381
