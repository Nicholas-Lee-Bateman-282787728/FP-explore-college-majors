My daughter-in-law descends from the Pettway family of Gees Bend,  through her father.

The next day, I was ready to jump in my car and go find this place and meet some of it's people. I wanted to know more about these women, their lives, what drives them on. These quilts made out of neccessity, yet, each one has a story. Rich in family history, unique craftmanship and artistry rarely seen in this day and age when squares can be bought by the bag and you can let your Singer do the sewing.

Southern history is deep, full of passion and rich in tradition. The Quiltmakers of Gee's Bend is deep, full of passion and rich in tradition. It is, in essence, southern history at it's finest.",1228089600,5,1132,4.473429951690822
