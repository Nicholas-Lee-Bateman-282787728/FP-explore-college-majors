7800790,3,1857093372,"The subject and it's information is fine, but I found the DVD to be too short. It's about 30 minutes and I would have liked it to have included more information on the paintings and the artists. This was my first time buying a DVD on art, rather than a book. Not totally satisfied but it's a good short DVD on Impressiontists in Paris for those who prefer to watch rather than read a book on it.",1189382400,,395,4.142857142857143
