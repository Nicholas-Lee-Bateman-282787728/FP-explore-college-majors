8445360,5,B004WNDUKI,"I got volume 1 & 2 for our kindergartener who is huge soccer fan and loves to watch these.  The tricks are shown slow, fast, and then in action against defender, which helps explain their practicality (apart form the cool effect).  Our son especially liked the slow parts as it helped him shed light on the footwork of some of the more complex moves. It also is great motivator for him to work on his ball-handling skills which is another pro.",1456185600,,443,4.45679012345679
8445361,3,B004WNDUKI,"I bought vol1 and vol2 for my son who plays travel soccer U12. He has already started using some of the tricks he picked up from the DVD. This is not for a player younger that 10 years old.  It also requires another skilled player/coach to practice or  rehearse the move with the player.  My son watches  a couple of the moves over and over, then practice it in the backyard.  I am now considering hiring a private coach to work with my son on some of these moves. If he can master some on these moves it would really build his confidence on the field.

I think  the DVD really needs a coach or trainer to practice the moves with the kids.",1409616000,,639,4.146341463414634
8445362,1,B004WNDUKI,"I bought this movie for my 6 year old daughter who is really great at soccer and wanted to learn more than I can teach her. I thought it would be a great instructional video that she could follow along with. NO! The menu is organized so that each ""trick"" has a name and you have to go through the menu and individually select each trick from a very confusing set of menus and submenus with trick names that neither of us know. Once you actually get to a trick video it just shows a quick video of somebody doing that trick. There are no options to ""play all."" The only option is to sit there for hours individually selecting each trick and waiting for it to load between each one. My daughter was too frustrated to deal with it after about 5 minutes. I will be asking the seller for my money back, ridiculous.",1393459200,,809,4.225806451612903
