8587240,5,B006W1SZXK,There good Dvds for going back down memory lane but if you're going to buy them I suggest you get a multi region blu ray player that's what I have works great and comes in handy!!,1489276800,,179,4.0
8587241,1,B006W1SZXK,"I can't make a review because I don't think these current dvd sets will play here in the U.S.  When will there be a version that we in the United States can easily play on our dvd players, etc.?  I've seen options on computers before to choose a region that your dvd will be playing in or something like that but I'm afraid to take the chance.

Thanks for any info anyone can provide.",1370131200,2,384,4.162162162162162
