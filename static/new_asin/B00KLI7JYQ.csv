8659720,4,B00KLI7JYQ,"At the moment, this Region B release is the best available transfer of a very hard-to-find movie.  Brando and Niven appear to have had a merry time playing the two rascals who are central to this comedy confection.  I don't see it as a great film, but it is fun to re-visit now and then.  Some critics were not kind to Brando's portrayal, but his slyly witty handling of the role works for me.  The video quality could be better, but the DVD is eminently viewable.",1527379200,,464,4.3604651162790695
8659721,4,B00KLI7JYQ,"This film is a delightful little 'bedroom farce' as they were called in the late 50s early 60s of the 20th century.  This is a story of a wolf in would-be royal's clothing, residing in a fictional Rivera town, living in a palatial villa and preying upon gullible, unsuspecting wealthy women desiring intrigue and a little naughty companionship, happily parting with their inheritances and jewels for the thrill of a chase and a fling.  This rogue's private hunting preserve is soon invaded by a rather coarse, ill mannered, boorish younger man intent on preying upon these same women, an affront to the rogue residing there.  David Niven plays the elegant, amoral Rivera rogue with his usual panache and wit.  Marlon Brando, in an amazing change of pace, plays the young wolf intent on poaching Niven's game. If this sounds like it's a familiar plot....it is.  Played to the hilt decades later by Michael Caine in the NIven role and Steve Martin filling Brando's shoes......in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", an equally delightful remake.  Shirley Jones play the American soap 'heiress' upon whom a bet is made, as to which rogue will bed her first and abscond with her fortune.  The comedy ensues, and though ""PG"" by today's standards, if funny and very entertaining.

The pity here is that this film has not made it onto the American DVD format.  Purchasing the region 2 versions, which I've done, only allows one to view a poor quality copy....probably taken from a VHS tape master.  When (and IF) this film makes its way onto a DVD or blue ray copy here in America, I sincerely hope you add it to your video library.  You won't be disappointed.",1523232000,,1643,4.790780141843972
