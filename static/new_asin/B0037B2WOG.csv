4080635,5,B0037B2WOG,"I love it. if you like funny and love romantic anime show. It is the one. It is Blu-ray but it isn't full screen. i don't know is it my problem or the discs. I've tried two blu-ray players with different TV too but still wise screen. That's what i don't like. ""come on it is Blu-ray.""",1280016000,,284,4.0
4080636,5,B0037B2WOG,"I loved the voices for OHSHC! But if it weren't for the amazing anime, I'd give it a 2. The quality was bad because I kept on seeing little pink spots on the animation. But still, OHSHC made me cry, laugh, and, ""awwwwwwwww"" a lot!! A must have anime! My favorite anime show ever! Let's just hope for a season 2 hopefully!",1276560000,,321,4.193548387096774
4080637,5,B0037B2WOG,The anime itself is light-hearted and all in all fun to watch. The blu-ray format is always a bonus and a must have in my opinion. The color and picture quality is to die for :) It was a little expensive but I regret nothing.,1275523200,,225,4.022222222222222
4080638,2,B0037B2WOG,"The show itself is great, but sadly Funimation gave it one of the worst releases in recent anime history.  First of all, like many Funi titles past and present, the episodes are overly compressed and the video suffers as a result.  Color banding, digital artifacts, and background noise are quite prevalent and very distracting.  I have seen bootleg DVDs that look better than this one.  Funimation was starting to get better when they were only doing 4 episodes a disc, but it's become quite obvious with releases like this that they cannot handle the now fairly standard 6 episodes per disc.

Second of all, the dub was just awful. Funimation has put out some bad dubs in recent years, like Kodocha and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, but Ouran takes the cake.  Once again, instead of putting though into their casting, they just simply took the route of using the ""Hot VA's"" of the moment.  So we get stuck with Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass in roles they truly do not fit.  In fact, their performances are so off, it drags the rest of the performances down, which is a shame.  Greg Ayres and others in the cast turn in truly great performances, but the laziness of Vic's and Caitlin's performances nearly ruin them.

The show itself should bet 4 stars, but this release is 1 or 2 stars at best.  Funimation should really be ashamed of this one.  I was really looking forward to this show, but these DVD sets have been a huge disappointment.",1272585600,13,1447,4.631372549019608
4080639,5,B0037B2WOG,"""The Ouran host Club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.""

Well, that's the basic description. But ""Ouran High School Host Club: Complete Series"" is so much more than just a slapsticky reverse-harem anime -- it's a charming little comedy series that's constantly awash in costumes, geekery, over-the-top schemes, and an adorable budding romance. Even in its more serious moments, it's utterly charming.

Haruhi Fujioka has just started on her scholarship at the elite Ouran Academy, and is looking for a quiet place to study... when she stumbles across the Host Club. The six wealthy boys there entertain girls with flirtation and elaborate costumes and decorations. The members: melodramatic and not-too-bright Tamaki, mischievous Hitachin twins Kaoru and Hikaru, cool-headed genius Kyoya, childlike Honey, and his silent stoic cousin Mori.

But when Haruhi accidentally breaks an antique vase, she finds herself drafted into the Host Club to pay off the debt... and only THEN does Tamaki find out she's a girl. But she continues working at the Host Club, and encounters some pretty bizarre adventures as she tries to navigate the world of the uber-wealthy. And when they aren't entertaining girls, the Host Club tries to help people with their fragmented relationships and troubles.

But just being rich doesn't keep the Host Club members from having their own troubles -- and as she gets to know them, Haruhi learns that the happy-go-lucky Tamaki has a tragic past that threatens to ruin his future. Will the little band of friends be able to help their ""boss""?

It's hard to really summarize an anime like ""Ouran High School Host Club"" -- it's a big fluffy whirl of costumes, roses, over-the-top luxury, and lighthearted pokes at anime conventions (""Yay! There's debauchery here!""). It's just such a fun little show, and it's made even better because it's almost surreal at times -- Haruhi even notes, after an ""Alice in Wonderland"" dream, that she can't even tell when she's awake or asleep.

There's lots of funny goofy dialogue (""I never would have pegged the boss as an S&M pervert."" ""I told you! It wasn't like that at all!"") and hilariously weird situations (the guys all dress up in over-the-top drag, causing Haruhi to roll around screaming with laughter). But there are some more touching moments as well, such as Tamaki comforting Haruhi when she's frightened by a thunderstorm, or the flashback episodes where we see how Tamaki befriended the icy Kyoya or the manipulative twins.

But the best part of the show is the characters -- Haruhi is a likably down-to-earth, sensible ""commoner"" who often seems weirded out by the antics of the megarich teens of Ouran. But she's slowly charmed by Tamaki, a sweet but not-very-bright young man who seems pretty confused about his romantic feelings. You end up liking Tamaki even better when you find out the truth about his family, and what a kind person he is.

And the rest of the cast is lots of fun as well: Hunny's cutesiness is a little annoying, but it's fun to see him kicking the collective backsides of a secret police force. Mori is cool (if underdeveloped), Kyoya is a delightful mix of insecurity and Machievellian scheming, and the twins are simply hilarious (especially since their ""theme"" is twincest).

""Ouran High School Host Club: The Complete Series"" is a delightful, lovable anime series, and leaves you desperately wishing it would never end. Charming, fluffy and fun.",1271980800,,3553,5.008474576271187
4080640,5,B0037B2WOG,This is one of the greatest romance comedy. I mean I could watch this anime over and over. The characters are so colorful and full of life. This anime is a real enjoyment. I love this anime and I watch it over and over!!!,1270857600,29,221,4.045454545454546
4080641,5,B0037B2WOG,"I just got this item today and have looked through some of the extras and I must say they are pretty entertaining. They have the ""outtakes"" section, which is basically a blooper reel from all the episodes, and while it doesn't show the actual voice actors, it does show the the scenes with the dialogue of the voice actors messing up or doing some improv. Some of the other extras include audio commentary on certain episodes and the textless songs. There's a preview for the manga provided by Viz and it shows some shots from one of the volumes that's big enough to read but don't expect it to be the complete volume. The episodes themselves are pretty good quality and you can choose from having English or Japanese audio and subtitles.
  The packaging is pretty nice, too much pink for my taste, but still nice and it has some quotes and pictures throughout. There isn't a booklet but after the case is taken out of the sleeve it folds out to show an episode guide on the left side and what to find on each disc.",1270080000,134,1015,4.422459893048129
4080642,5,B0037B2WOG,"I won't go into too much detail, because part of the fun of this anime series is just hanging on for the ride, not knowing alot going into it.

But basically the story is about a girl who enters a very nice, prestigious high school where rich kids are numerous and poor people are thought of as fairytale material. She meets the highschool's Host Club, which is basically a group of young men who entertain the school's young ladies. Keep in mind they're all rich, and somewhat arrogant, so they kind of just sit around and talk about rich kid stuff.

The Host Club thinks she's a guy, she accidently breaks an expensive vase and instantly earns herself a very large debt, and the only way to pay it off is to join the Host Club.

This is just the beginning. Like I said I don't want to go into too much detail because Ouran High School Host Club is the type of anime that is best enjoyed when not too much is known about it going in.

I was mainly interested in the series because I thought they were all guys (she looks like a guy when she works as a ""Host Boy"") and I thought it would be fun and romantic (and gay) to watch.

It is fun, and romantic too. But Its not what I expected. However, I never thought it would be THIS good! I am really enjoying the series (almost finished with it) and I like how each episode brings enough humor and character movement to keep you interested. And speaking of the humor, I find myself laughing out-loud alot. This type of comedy is just the thing I have been looking for. And there's just enough gay humor too!

The animation is really cool. Very detailed, and cartoonish (if only to add to the comedic effect). The music is nice, but nothing worth freaking out over.

But if there's one thing that makes this series shine, its the characters/story. Its charming, witty, hilarious, with hints of mild sexual comedy and social stuff (rich people, poor people), but it never takes itself too seriously. The show knows what it is and what it wants, and as a result we the viewers are presented with a well thought out anime series with high replay value.

I'm really glad I got into this series because its now one of my favorites. Its easy to fall in love with the Host Club boys, and they're all compelling and quirky enough that they move the episodic situations along with ease and before you know it you've been watching for hours.

When an anime series accomplishes this, its well worth your time in my opinion.",1268870400,105,2458,4.384615384615385
4080643,5,B0037B2WOG,This has always been one of my favorite animes and was happy to find it at a decent price. It arrived 2 days before the earliest estimated  date and it works perfectly.,1514505600,,168,4.25
4080644,5,B0037B2WOG,"My favorite anime! I own this and the live action one as well, I bought this because Netflix took it off for a time and i needed to watch this every night to help me fall asleep. Its hilarious even my little brother loves watching it! ""This is a reverse harem!"" ""There's debauchery here!""  Can you guess that episode lol??? I would recommend to everyone just getting into anime and people who love anime in general! The dvd's arrived on time and came in perfect condition! Love it!",1509667200,2,481,4.465909090909091
4080645,5,B0037B2WOG,"I absolutely love this! I only have one issue with the series itself. WHY DOESNT HARUHI GET TO TRY ANY FANCY TUNA??? That was mentioned in several episodes, but she never gets to try it! That became a motivating factor in concealing her gender. Otherwise it was great.",1506816000,,268,4.604166666666667

The extra time is only commentary over certain episodes with the voice actors.  Purchased for my daughter who lives anime... this was a big letdown. They should have been more specific with content",1506038400,,363,4.950819672131147

4080659,5,B0037B2WOG,"I've been collecting physical copies of my favourites on Netflix, and I was searching for Ouran at a good price. I noticed that this had dropped in price in my Saved for Later cart so I snatched it up at nearly fifteen dollars cheaper than at my local B&N. Love Amazon for this availability, great! As for the physical item, it came in perfect condition no scratches on the discs, the dust cover had no wear damage, and the plastic case was intact aka not cracked (much better than the shipping through darling Mal-Wart[tm]).

And finally, Ouran (the anime, at least) as a whole is an evercharming subversion of traditional high school anime tropes. The dub is one of the best ever English dub pieces, and unfortunately it was the first version of Ouran I ever watched SO I'm stuck with it forever. No matter how much I like Mamoru Miyano as Tamaki, amongst other characters that I've loved, (and dislike Vic Mignogna as a person), the English version is the way to go for native English speakers. Watch it in Japanese first if you haven't watched it at all, otherwise, you know what I'm talking about.

At twelve, I had such an affection for so many of the characters, and each of the people in my friend group had a favourite. It's just cute middle school memories crap, and I have such a nostalgia for it even though it's just a decade old. The ending is a liiiiittle unnecessary, but it wraps it up in a neat enough bow to be satisfactory for my soul.

Seriously, just watch it if you haven't. There's so much good in the heart of this series, and I recommend it to everyone who has a little bit of knowledge about anime and understands the need to ironically recognize and subvert tropes of traditional teen content. Cute, mostly lighthearted, relatable characters, what more could you ask for? ^_^",1499299200,2,1803,4.558641975308642

The story about a young girl becoming friends with a group of rich boys at a fancy academy never gets boring. The comedy and drama are perfectly balanced.

4080710,5,B0037B2WOG,This anime gets its kicks by being the go to anime to express 'slice of life' and 'moe' while secretly being brilliant and extremely well executed. Capturing the feel of the manga and making some concise cuts leaves a feel good anime that actually makes you want to be a character in the show. It's main claim to fame is how absurdly funny it is with a wide variety of jokes that can be accomplished with a vivid and diverse character set. Well aware of its own genre the episodes often satire themselves while establishing real character growth. I've watched this anime a good number of times and its always good. A excellent match for fans of 'Fruits Basket' I highly recommend to anime lovers of all genres. The art is excellent and the voice acting features fan favorites and is great for all ages.

The edges of the box on the outside of the DVD case were a little bent up and had some of the white showing because of how it was bent. Though, it wan't too noticeable, I wish it had come in a little bit better. Also, one of the pieces broke off inside of the DVD case where you push to take the DVD out of the case. But, since it was on the inside and no one would notice the little piece missing, I didn't care too much about it. I also love the design of the box on the outside of the case with it's vibrant colors and crisp look. Though it was made in 2006 and the  anime doesn't fit to my flat screen with the video playing towards the middle with black spaces on either side of it, I think that they made the anime look really clear and clean looking. I also love the commentary on a few of the episodes with the voice actors. it's really hilarious how they react to the anime!

4080933,5,B0037B2WOG,"This is simply too good of a price for too good of a show. Ouran High School Host Club was way ahead of its time in a lot of ways. It shows acceptance for personal oddities that still aren't completely accepted in society today, and pokes fun at things that take themselves too seriously. It made me laugh. A lot. And even though it's a pretty old show as far as anime is concerned, it looks AMAZING on bluray. The colors, the sharpness, the music; they all benefit from the bluray treatment. It is also one of the few anime whose dub I can actually stand. While not a fan of Vic as Tamaki (why would I listen to him when Miyano Mamoru's silky voice is a button click away?) the overall cast was pretty good. I still prefer subs, but this dub is generally well done. I'm a big fan of the twins in both languages.

If you want big laughs, then Ouran is most definitely for you!",1412208000,,876,4.183431952662722

It is in English so you don't have to read it the whole time.

For those who haven't seen the show, it's so good. Be warned though because it's all laced with undertones of homosexuality. Lovely homosexuality. :D",1407456000,,417,4.546666666666667

The voice acting is great, the set up is gorgeous, and the extras are fun. My only concern was that my copy had its top hinge broken off; so now it can't close properly. This is a small detail though, and the rest of the packaging was fine. I recommend this to any anime fan; big or small, young or old, girl or boy.",1395532800,,485,4.282608695652174
4080953,5,B0037B2WOG,I bought Ouran High School Host Club the complete series for my daughter after she fell in love with the series on netflix. It's a family favorite as are the manga the anime is based on. The plot is silly and quirky without ever taking itself too serious and it's a good choice for a family show. The anime is clean and appropriate for nearly any age. We received it earlier than the stated time and in excellent condition. I would recommend this anime to parents looking to start their children into the anime world in a clean friendly way or even for adults who want a good laugh with the silly antics.,1395187200,,604,4.353982300884955

It hilarious, but it also has a few moments of deepness that are surprisingly sincere. If you're on the fence about ordering it: do. You won't regret it! And, if you're a long-time fan and haven't read the manga: get on that ASAP. The manga goes faaaaaar beyond the anime; ties up a lot of loose stories and leaves you really satisfied, knowing all that you wanted to know about the hosts' lives after high school :)",1394496000,,592,4.294642857142857

It's funny and outrageous and the antics of the characters will pull on your heart-strings and make you laugh until you cry, leaving you begging for more. The cast does a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life and if I had one complaint about the entire series, it's that it ended entirely before it should have (the manga had sooooo much more to it). I must insist that you watch the outtakes though. They're extremely funny and even people who aren't fans of the show will find them hilarious.",1392422400,,573,4.519230769230769

This is a great show if you are looking for something light-hearted and fun. The Ouran High School Host Club is a typical reverse-harem anime that surrounds one girl and six boys in a unique high school setting. It revolves around each of the characters' personal stories and the stories of how they came to know one another. I legitimately belly-laughed out loud during almost every episode I watched, and the further you get into the series the happier you will be that you own every episode.

The manga has also been completed and offers a much more complete (and satisfying) ending. The full manga consists of 18 volumes, 83 chapters.

4081023,5,B0037B2WOG,"Ouran (High School) Host Club is quite the unique anime series.
Though essentially a romantic comedy aimed at girls, there are very human serious moments too.
The premise revolves around honor student Haruji Fujioka, an average common girl who enters the prestigious Ouran Academy for the rich and elite.

Upon accidentally breaking a valuable vase, she becomes in debt to the school's host club. Due to her boyish looks, Haruji passes up for a boy. The show takes us inside the lives of the Host Club lives, and many comedic and very human situations emerge among them.

The DVD set contains 4 disks with extras that include audio commentary in various episodes by the American voice cast, and pages from the manga/comics that inspired the anime show.
Original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles is included along with the English dub. The box includes gorgeous artwork from the Japanese animation studios on the inside too.

Is a beautiful semi-romantic comedy show with very lovable characters, of great 24 episodes, with a satisfactory and happy ending. Highly recommended.",1370649600,,1083,5.142045454545454

Haruhi Fujioka is a scholarship student at the prestigious Ouran Academy, a fictitious high school located in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Third Music Room, a place where the Ouran Academy Host Club, a group of six male students, gathers to entertain female ""clients"". During their first meeting, Haruhi accidentally knocks over and breaks an antique vase valued at 8,000,000 (US$80,000 in the U.S. English manga)[1] and is told to repay the cost in service to the club. Haruhi's short hair, slouching attire and gender-ambiguous face cause her to be mistaken by the hosts for a male student. The hosts all agree that Haruhi would be a good host, thus making her join the host club. Ultimately she agrees to join the Club as a host herself (dressed as a male) in order to pay off her debt.[2] She agrees to join since she does not mind hosting as long as she can pay the debt off faster. The hosts do later find out that she is, in fact, a girl. They keep this a secret, so no one will be able to tell. The Ouran Private Academy encompasses kindergarten to twelfth grade (along with a university). Most students come from wealthy families, but in special cases, merit scholarships are granted to exceptional students from a lower income bracket. The school's unofficial motto is ""Lineage counts first, wealth a close second,"" meaning students with stellar family backgrounds but low socioeconomic status may be given top priority over those from rich families with lesser pedigrees.

On a more personal review note the supporting characters are phenomenal as well as a lot of the original humor being intact.

This is a must see for Anime fans!",1370044800,,1796,4.783870967741936
4081027,4,B0037B2WOG,"Arrived on time. There was some minor damage to the packaging: The 4-DVD set has the 4 disks mounted on a hinge inside the case. Mine arrived with the hinge broken. The disks are fine, I just need to be a little careful taking them out & putting them back in.

The series itself is hilarious. The basic setup has been covered elsewhere, so I won't go much into that. The writing is pretty sharp, with the occasional zinger out of left field that had me laughing out loud. The technical quality varies. One episode sounds like it has different voice actors for 2 of the characters, and some of the animation looks like it was rushed. (This isn't just an occasional cut to a more 'cartoony' style for reaction shots and so forth--entire episodes show differences.) The outtakes are fun, the commentary is pretty good, and the lack of an option for English or Japanese dub is a disappointment; this is English-only. (None of these are deal-breakers in my book, but they may be for some, so I'll mention them here.)

Unlike some other series, over the course of the story we learn the backstories of several of the characters, so we see the reasons why they're the way they are, and there's some real growth and development over the series. Some of the backstories are.... well, no more implausible or occasionally silly than any other comedy anime. There are hints of various adult situations, but as usual for this genre, none of the actual humor goes beyond a mild PG. (Though in a couple of places, if your kid gets that joke, it's not my fault.)

I spent the first 8 episodes thinking ""This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen"" then in episode 8 we see the the show bring out some slightly darker plot lines and I realized the first part was actually trying to be the dumbest thing ever.  Somehow this show manages to be a brutal satire on the whole romantic comedy/shojo genre, but at the same time make it real.  Every single character (minus possibly Haruhi) is a stereotype, but they are so three dementional and believable that they made me fall in love all over again.  This show has the perfect mix of silly, sweet, and heart-tugging.

I thought the production was wonderful.  The artwork and animation added to the absurdity and surrealism while the voice acting was incredible.  What makes this show so great is that when the characters are dumb the acting, animation, and even the characters themselves acknowledge that it's dumb.  When I think back on my high school days, I realize that I did a lot of crazy shenanigans just like these boys.  It was a great time of life and I love reliving it again with this show.

As I gotten into the tv series I realized that this Romantic Comedy had many layers of exciting aspects that made it stand out of your generic high school movies.  I really don't want to spoil the suspense but, if anyone is truely looking for a great anime adaptable for the nonanime fan this would be it.

Haruhi is down-to-earth and intelligent. A character that most girls can relate to and want to be. In addition to a strong female lead, the depth given to the other character is something rarely seen in anime. Not character is overlook and the anime is made richer for it. The complexity of the characters emotions add to the vibrate story line and will make viewers instant fans.

Haruhi is a scholarship student at the most elite school in the county. Due to an accident she is coerce into working for the famous ONSHC. A host club is were males entertain female guests. The host club is comprised of the super elite boys at the school. Before she knows it she is working as a host! Then the boys find out she is a girl - all in the first episode!

Anime review;
The Anime was very nice; a hearthwhelming and funny story, but I was really unsatisfied with the ending. The ending was so unsatisfying because it left a lot of rocks unturned (figure of speech). It didn't answer many of my personal questions on the story. Despite that, it was still a good and hillarious Anime that I would want to watch again in the future.

I would suggest looking Ouran High School Host Club on Wikipedia if you want more details.  I'm a big fan.  I watched this anime and immediately wanted to read the manga (I did get the Ouran box set from Amazon as well).

The packaging was great.  The DVD was packed in tight for little to no movement during shipment.  There was cellophane around the DVD set.  The outside skin is made out of a light cardboard that can be damaged if not careful, but it's visually appealing.  The DVD cover has two sides and all four discs are in one case.  My DVDs played all the episodes great as well as the captioning and audio.

I'm very happy with my DVD set. If you have any doubts you can watch this series in English voice on Netflix and I believe you can search youtube for some episodes (may be Japanese with English subtitles).

As mentioned before I did get the manga box set as well.  There are 26 episodes in the anime, but about 83 episodes in the manga. I love them both but you do not need one to enjoy the other.  I mention in my Ouran box set review that I read the manga free online before purchasing to make sure it was worth the price.

Hilarious and heartwarming, it is a near perfect series.  There are a few episodes, mostly revolving around the Lobelia girls, that I do not love, but it is a small blemish in the otherwise wonderful series.  I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in anime or in cute love stories.

The great thing about OHSHC is that, if you look closely there is some semblance of a plot, which all builds up to the heart-warming conclusion. This, however, is my only complaint - that it ends there. The last episodes would make for a good season finale maybe, but not a series finale. It's a little open-ended for my tastes, but the overall anime is very good and sweet. All in all, it's a great series of you're looking for something that you don't really have to delve into.

4081105,5,B0037B2WOG,"""The Ouran host Club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.""

Well, that's the basic description. But ""Ouran High School Host Club: Complete Series"" is so much more than just a slapsticky reverse-harem anime -- it's a charming little comedy series that's constantly awash in costumes, geekery, over-the-top schemes, and an adorable budding romance. Even in its more serious moments, it's utterly charming.

Haruhi Fujioka has just started on her scholarship at the elite Ouran Academy, and is looking for a quiet place to study... when she stumbles across the Host Club. The six wealthy boys there entertain girls with flirtation and elaborate costumes and decorations. The members: melodramatic and not-too-bright Tamaki, mischievous Hitachin twins Kaoru and Hikaru, cool-headed genius Kyoya, childlike Honey, and his silent stoic cousin Mori.

But when Haruhi accidentally breaks an antique vase, she finds herself drafted into the Host Club to pay off the debt... and only THEN does Tamaki find out she's a girl. But she continues working at the Host Club, and encounters some pretty bizarre adventures as she tries to navigate the world of the uber-wealthy. And when they aren't entertaining girls, the Host Club tries to help people with their fragmented relationships and troubles.

But just being rich doesn't keep the Host Club members from having their own troubles -- and as she gets to know them, Haruhi learns that the happy-go-lucky Tamaki has a tragic past that threatens to ruin his future. Will the little band of friends be able to help their ""boss""?

It's hard to really summarize an anime like ""Ouran High School Host Club"" -- it's a big fluffy whirl of costumes, roses, over-the-top luxury, and lighthearted pokes at anime conventions (""Yay! There's debauchery here!""). It's just such a fun little show, and it's made even better because it's almost surreal at times -- Haruhi even notes, after an ""Alice in Wonderland"" dream, that she can't even tell when she's awake or asleep.

There's lots of funny goofy dialogue (""I never would have pegged the boss as an S&M pervert."" ""I told you! It wasn't like that at all!"") and hilariously weird situations (the guys all dress up in over-the-top drag, causing Haruhi to roll around screaming with laughter). But there are some more touching moments as well, such as Tamaki comforting Haruhi when she's frightened by a thunderstorm, or the flashback episodes where we see how Tamaki befriended the icy Kyoya or the manipulative twins.

But the best part of the show is the characters -- Haruhi is a likably down-to-earth, sensible ""commoner"" who often seems weirded out by the antics of the megarich teens of Ouran. But she's slowly charmed by Tamaki, a sweet but not-very-bright young man who seems pretty confused about his romantic feelings. You end up liking Tamaki even better when you find out the truth about his family, and what a kind person he is.

And the rest of the cast is lots of fun as well: Hunny's cutesiness is a little annoying, but it's fun to see him kicking the collective backsides of a secret police force. Mori is cool (if underdeveloped), Kyoya is a delightful mix of insecurity and Machievellian scheming, and the twins are simply hilarious (especially since their ""theme"" is twincest).

""Ouran High School Host Club: The Complete Series"" is a delightful, lovable anime series, and leaves you desperately wishing it would never end. Charming, fluffy and fun.",1332547200,3,3553,5.008474576271187
4081106,1,B0037B2WOG,"The anime is fun, and if you are looking for a good laugh with a bit of a serious undertone, this is the anime for you. The characters are all well designed,and you can't help but love them.  The music works well with the scenes and each character has their own unique personality and way of dealing with things.  There is no real cookie cutter character in the series so it is a breath of fresh air.

Now, as for amazon...you disappoint me.  The only way a box set of an anime is WORTH this much money is if the box is actually sterling silver and those discs are made of gold.  You would have to be out of your mind to even consider selling this for that much money, because the buyer isn't stupid.  Doing a simple google search for this series and there are at least four different sites where you can get this exact item for under thirty dollars.  The pricing for this item is beyond moronic and if the seller ever expects to sell it, they better lower the price or it will just sit there collecting dust.  So unless, these discs are indeed gold, you have failed to impress me and it will be a cold day in all the seven hells before I would EVER think to spend this much for a simple anime.",1327968000,15,1194,4.160869565217391
4081107,4,B0037B2WOG,"Well, the hype has subsided and the price is back down to a reasonable level. It was in the stratosphere. It was definitely fun to watch. I still laugh at some of the cut scenes right at the original breaks.

You already know the plot:
The protagonist, Haruhi, is a high school girl who won a scholarship to Ouran Academy, a school for the uber rich. There she is promptly mistaken for a boy, and winds up a member of the host club, where she instantly becomes just about the most popular member. Several host club members fuss over her constantly and are actually rivals for her affection. Her father is a TV which only adds to the hilarity of the whole series.
It really could have used a second season, maybe the producers will see the after print demand and will either a: re-release the set, or b: create a year 2, or c: do both.

I'm keeping the same rating because i never lowered it.",1327536000,,891,4.3293413173652695

4081113,5,B0037B2WOG,"The Show: Like Fruits Basket, this show has funny lines and touching moments. Ouran is better and can be watched repeatedly. It is rated Teen due to some of the words that fortunately go over the head of most young. All the main characters are fun with their own personalities. The voices are casted well. This show is so well done it made me become a fan of the manga which it stays very faithful in feel and story until about book 9 (now at book 16). The anime wraps up as well as it can with only 26 episodes. I do enjoy the few honorifics and wish the manga used them. The main honorific used is Senpai= older school classmate.
Extras: The disks are worth purchasing just for the outtakes. We laughed so hard that we had to watch the outtakes twice to hear things we laughed over the first time.  Nothing better than hearing Col. Roy Mustang say, ""mmm... Mori like seashells."" I did have to explain to the 12 year old a few adult terms. The six episode commentaries are done by the voice actors- entertaining and only wish there were more. In the commentary, the actors sing a Tamaki song that is now sung frequently in our house, ""Na-ma-ha-GE, Na-ma-ha-GE, Na-ma-ha-GE.""

4081116,3,B0037B2WOG,"I'm a big fan of this series, and had been waiting excitedly to get my copy ever since I ordered it here. This was my first anime series, and one of my all-time favourites. So why only three stars? Well, there are a few reasons for that:

1. HORRIBLE subs: I'm not used to fansubs being waaaay better than the official ones, but this is definately the case. In only the first episode I already managed to spot a few mistakes - like writing ""1000 yen"" instead of 1000 customers, or designations. That's a pretty bad mistake, especially for people who don't know the script by heart from over-watching or something. My japanese doesn't exceed the new N4 level, and English isn't my first language, yet even I can spot all these mal-translations easily. Shame on you, funimation.

2. The complete lack of any Japanese extras: One of my favourite things about the series (and I'm sure many people will agree) is the outstanding Japanese voice acting cast. However, there are absolutely NO extras about the Japanese cast, production team, or even an interview with the Japanese director. I knew that's what I was getting from reading the description, still I can't hide my disappointment at the fact. Again, shame on you funimation.

3. Picture & sound quality(Japanese only, since I don't watch dubs): As someone who watched this series on the internet at first (in barely passable quality), the dvd makes the animation look spectacular. The picture quality is very good, and as the original series is an eye candy that's recognizeable even in low rez, the DVD is such a treat! Mind you, if you're into picture quality - go buy the blue-ray, which will probably be even awesomer.
The sound is very good as well. Nothing much to say about that.

4. Packaging: The overall design is very very nice. The packaging isn't that of a normal DVD, more like a DVD ""Digipack"" (the closest thing that came to my mind). When I first got it I just looked for hours at the packaging. Trust me, you won't be disappointed at that.

This was just my experience. Hope it helped!",1314489600,14,2056,4.652892561983471
4081117,5,B0037B2WOG,"I stumbled upon this series a week or so ago while I was browsing Netflix. I'm so glad I gave it a try. :) I'm a pretty avid anime collector so after I finished Ouran on Netflix, I immediately went to Amazon to buy it. The price was very affordable and from what I can initially tell, the box and discs are in good condition too. (I just got this in the mail a few minutes ago so I haven't actually tried the discs yet.)

The only problem with this set from Amazon is that I didn't receive the bright pink box set, but rather a different box set. I think it's the second or third picture that Amazon has posted for this series. It's not bad by any means, but I was just expecting a bright pink box so it's a little misleading. Other than that however, I think that anyone and everyone should give this series a try! The characters and voice actors are amazing. Ouran is sure to leave a smile on your face. :)",1312156800,5,908,4.101123595505618

I can't really say if funimation did a poor job with this or not.  My eye is not so great that I notice the bad visuals that some people talk about but I have a lot of respect for people who can tell the difference and believe them.  Its just common sense that a set of 4 episodes per DVD would have a better quality than extending it to 6 which is almost 3 hours of time on a dvd. 26 episodes should ALWAYS be put on 6 DVDs.  not four. I have to agree that funimation uses the ""SAME OLD SAME OLD"" voice actors.  At conventions they say they have a pool of hundreds of voice actors, but I sure don't see it.

4081121,5,B0037B2WOG,"This has got to be one of my favorite animes of all time. It has lots of humor, comedy, fun, and romance - all the elements of perfect shojo.

Haruhi Fujioka is an honor student who enrolls into the rich kid school, ""Ouran Academy"". After stumbling into the Host Club's meeting and entertainment room and breaking a prized vase, Haruhi is mistaken to be a boy and must repay the members of the Host Club back by becoming a Host member.

The story goes on from that with 26 episodes. This is unfortunate because the series seemed too short and it left a miserable cliff hanger - what will happen to all the Host club members? Hopefully after they finish up with the manga, they can conclude the anime with a season 2. But we'll see how that goes.

The animation is hilarious - I love anime because it accentuates the person's skeptical and dubious expressions on faces, and OHSC excels at this. All the characters have their very own special personality. Tamaki, the gorgeous and blubbering idiot, Kyoya, the smart and handsome one who is tactical at business, the twin brothers Kaoru and Hikaru, usually referred to as the ""Little Devil Types"" in the show, Honey, the little boy ""Lolita"" and, Mori, ""the cool type"" and basically Honey's bodyguard and companion. And, of course, Haruhi, the common-sensed heroine of the story. Out of all the animes I have watched, I'd have to say that Haruhi is one of the few heroines that I actually like and admire. There is a touch of sexual comedy, including some very mild and suggestive yaoi and yuri (aka homosexuality fiction) that is present throughout the story which adds a great part of humor into the plot. The music isn't anything to brag about (but, just IMO). Voices were pretty good for both the subbed and dubbed.

All in all, great story I'd recommend anyone seeing!",1310947200,3,1819,4.6397515527950315

The entire box art is completely different and instead of having 625 minutes, it only has 600. My best guess is that Funimation changed the box art and everything recently. I cannot seem to find any information about them changing it though. On my cover it has each of the host club members with different facial expressions. However, this anime does have great quality, story, and humor. It would definitely give 5 stars if it wasn't for the different box set. The only reason I am giving this product three stars is because it is not what I was expecting. If this is the newer version, I am slightly happy though because it doesn't look nearly as gay as the pink one (haha). I may post a picture of the box set I got later. I am also debating returning it as I am not sure if this is a legit release or what.",1308787200,8,941,4.233333333333333

I love the series and as sad i think is the right word as I am to say this I have watched it about 20 or so times now 0-0. You know what the disk doesn't have a single scratch on it either so I would say that the DVDs are really durable. Another thing that I just love about the series is that you get text-less opening and closing songs. You also get out takes (were the voice artists (I guess is what you call them) mess up and I find those just hilarious X3) You also get commentaries for some of the episodes, and I would say that they are all funny :).

4081125,5,B0037B2WOG,"The one everyone has seen or at least should see. I patrol forums quite often and when I was just beggining my life as an anime watcher I found that people kept recommending the same dang thing. Ouran High School Host Club and I of course decided to NOT watch it because I thought that it would be like the three One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto. So I continued on my days not watching Ouran High School Host Club and found myself getting highly irritated about the way people kept reccomending it. Why? I have no clue it's just me.

So while I was at a friends house I got really bored, turned on her laptop, and watched about three minutes of the first episode before I heard 'Hey that's Ouran High School Host Club', my friend was watching as well. We sat through 11 episodes of it before I had reluctantly had to leave.

Ouran High School Host Club is a must have for all anime watchers, it's not too violent, there's not too much fanservice (unless it's humorice and really there's nothing to see), and the humor isn't crude. There is some swearing, but I'm reccomending this to children as well, parents will laugh along with their children. Well not mine, because they hate all the chibiness and love a good story. This anime does have a good story as well, don't let them fool you, each episode is like a different story all leading up to the final whole story.

So please don't be like me, read this review and just buy it, you won't be regretting it ^^",1308441600,3,1459,4.356617647058823

Now there are quite a few....how should i put it.......gay moments in the show. Now that doesn't bother me to much as its done in a comical way. There is never any boy kissing or anything like that but they do suggest it. :)I was waiting a long time to buy this anime, the episodes I saw were online. I just couldn't pay $70 for an anime (no matter how gr8 it is. Then I saw that the price on Amazon was dropped to $30! I was SOOOOO happy! :) Definitely pick this one up.

4081127,5,B0037B2WOG,"I received this on Monday and the wait could not be more worth it.

First off, this contains all 26 episodes of the series Ouran High School Host Club which was originally done as a manga by Bisco Hatori (which I own 3 volumes of), all in glorious Dolby Digital Surround sound and 4:3 aspect ratio.

This does also contain many extras including outtakes every 2 discs for the episodes that came before it (which is the actual voice actors, not the characters themselves.) and commentaries by the voice actors and the ADR director of the series which are hilarious to listen to when watching your favorite episodes and pages from the manga itself. The rest are just trailers and textless OP's and ED's, which is a standard for Funimations DVD's

My only gripe with the actual CASE is that it's too pink.

4081128,5,B0037B2WOG,"So... I never wanted to love this show. I just can't get any work done without noise, and so usually I'll just throw some random tv show on the roku box and get to work. I read a synopsis of this show ahead of time, and it sounded so ridculous I figured it would be so crappy I could ignore it as it played in the background. Except, it was funny. The first episode was funny. And so was the second. And the third. There were some ignorable moments, but I found myself watching it more and more closely. Then the episode entitled, ""A Day in the Life of the Fujioka Family,"" began - and for the entirety of the epsiode I rolled on the ground laughing. It's one of the funniest episodes of television, period. Up there with It's Always Sunny's, ""Mac and Dee go on Welfare,"" and that Friends episode where Phoebe tries to out Chandler and Monica's relationship by hitting on Chandler. Nope, wait - it's much funnier than that Friends episode. Then, the show continues and it's a bit hit and miss for a while, but by that point it's not merely a comedy - you begin to really care about these characters; characters who started out just a farce of common types suddenly become interesting and you want to know more about them. The show, towards the last third, just improves as it goes on - until you're sitting on the edge of your seat, needing to know what happens next. By the last episodes, my brothers and I (my brothers were pulled in as reluctantly and as firmly as I was) were all yelling at the television, rooting on the characters as they faced their biggest obstacles yet! You don't know how much I wish there were a second season, and a third. I like these characters. They're different and fun and good. I want to see them finish highschool, go to college, start their lives. Seems unlikely, given that there hasn't been a second season yet - but I'll still be hoping.
Oh, yeah - and I'm so addicted to these 26 episodes, I bought the DVD set. Totally worth it. Especially for the outtakes.",1306454400,,1999,4.376344086021505

The last one I truely loved and bought was DeathNote...So I was looking at some things that Vic Mignona had done and I saw this. So I gave it a try. I was hooked after the first episode and had to own the series for myself. I don't see myself as a girlie girl but I LOVED this anime. Most of the guys I have shown it to love it too! Just cause there is lots of pink and flowers means nothing! This anime is hysterical but has a lovely balance of comedy and serious moments. Enjoy this.

It's probably the best forty bucks I'll ever spend! The story of Ouran Highschool Host club is about a girl named Haruhi who stumbles upon the host club boys accidentally at the new prestigious school she's going to. She trips and breaks one of the expensive vases in the room and has to pay the club back buy working for them. It's a really hysterical show and probably my favorite anime. The characters go as such, Haruhi: a girl who thinks very highly of feminism and isn't afaid to dress up like a boy because she believes gender doesn't matter. Tamaki: the host clubs ""prince"" and is one of the funniest characters. He quickily develops a crush on haruhi and always tries to get her attention. The twins Hikaru and Karou: these two are the devil twins and live up to there title i love them. Kyoya: very dark savvy and doesn't do anything without getting something out of it,and always is writting something down when people are talking!. Honey:A 6year old who looks like he's 11 and acts like it and Mori is basically the quiet one who doesn't talk very much but is still funny.

The whole show is told from the point of view of an girl that got a full scholarship to Ouran High School.  A ""Well to do"" Academy for the extremely rich.  I don't want to give away to much of the story.  If your not sure I would recommend that you look up a online and watch a few episodes before buying or adding to your que.

4081134,5,B0037B2WOG,"Cute (although very pink) boxset, with a great load of extras and a great series.

I don't watch the English DUB for this particular anime, but the Sub was perfect as was the english captions. Very well made product.

This anime is built more on the laughs, than on the romance, so its appropriate for either gender really. Although if there is ever a sequel to this anime, that one might delve more into actual character development, this one keeps things pretty simple and happy.

The last few episodes have things get slightly serious, but if you know this anime at all, you know that even when things get serious: may of the characters are built to still make jokes and be humorous.

The main character is rather ""unmotivated"" as is part of the joke in the series, but because she has to pay back a debt to this ""Host Club"" of very wealthy, handome young men, she is forced to dress as a boy and entertain (innocently) young women at their school. This obviously causes her some problems whenever it looks as if her secret will be released.

4081143,5,B0037B2WOG,"I actually got my hands on a *cough* probably illegal *cough* digital copy of the soundtrack for this anime some years ago, and I loved it. I have to admit, though, that the album art that came with it really turned me off -- at risk of being politically incorrect, I have to confess that I thought the show looked completely fruity. Eventually, I got around to trying the first episode on Funi's website, just to see what it was about, and before I knew it, I'd watched the whole series and was humbly apologizing for ever thinking it looked dumb. OHSHC (as I abbreviate it) is one of the most charming and laugh-out-loud hilarious anime I've seen. The characters are endearing, the story is goofy but fun and frequently poignant, and the music is great.

The English dub is a disappointment, though of course I'm one of those snobs who could count the dubs I actually like on the fingers of one hand. Regardless, the show itself is definitely worth checking out. I'm very glad I overcame my reluctance (read: prejudice) and gave the series a chance.",1292198400,,1051,4.590425531914893

The show follows a girl named Haruhi who looks like a boy after cutting her hair off (because of gum stuck in it).  She stumbles upon the host club's meeting place and accidentally knocks over an expensive urn.  To repay her debt to the club, she joins on as the newest host.  Most people can't tell that Haruhi is a girl, so she fits right in.  The characters in the show are hilarious and some romantic developments make it even more interesting.  You are sure to find a favorite character in the club-- mine is Tamaki.

The only thing negative that I can say is that there is only one season.  The manga is just finishing up in Japan so hopefully they will consider doing one more season of the anime!!  Watch Ouran Host Club, you won't regret it!",1290211200,6,1010,4.347593582887701

I'm a big fan of the manga, so I thought I'd give the anime a shot. I was extremely shocked when I began watching. This show is just as good as the manga. It follows the story line, with the addition/subtraction of some plot points and a different Ouran Fair plot. Each of the voice actors (in English and Japanese) do each character justice. The characters themselves are hilarious and diverse. The plot is entertaining. Don't let the pink covering fool you; this show isn't even that girly/shojo-y. The fact that I actually bought the series really says something, especially since I watched the whole series twice through a friend before buying it on Amazon (and I'm super duper frugal).

Vic Mignona's reputation proceeds him. Though I think Caitlin Glass's voice at times gets annoying its a great story. Greg Ayers (Kaoru) is amazing.
A young genius has been accepted to the prestigious academy of Ouran where only the wealthy attend school. Haruhi is but a poor girl going to school on the merits of her brain, she dresses sloppily and is a real loner. But the one day seeking refuge she goes into a music room for peace and quite only to find the chaotic host club who attend to the lovely fantasies of young women at the school with their dashing looks. You have Tamaki, the romantic king. Kyoya, the cool type. Honey, the boy lolita type (who is second to the oldest surprisingly when he's so short). Mori the silent and stoic type. And Hikaru and Kaoru the mischievious types. Haruhi ends up breaking a vase that puts her in so much debt she is made to be the dog of the host club attending to their errands until they catch sight of her charms and decide to use her as a host as well... freaking out after they finally discover she's a girl. It is up to Haruhi to make sense in the chaos that is the host club and finish her debt. But will love find a way in the host club?
The only thing I must say that's negative about the series is no darn kiss between our favorite couple nor the ending isn't like the book, then again the manga is yet to end.",1283904000,3,1514,4.224137931034483
