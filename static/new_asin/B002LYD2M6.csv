3949421,5,B002LYD2M6,"My son who is 4 years old loves these DVDs. I didn't buy them as a collection but one by one, which make them a littler more expences. My son is Autistic & his form of learning is totally visual. It's for this reason that I bought them. My son who is just starting talking improved his pronuciation a lot. Now he enfazes every single letter when talks & reads. With the word factory Dvd, my son really got the concept of reading. My son was spelling words since he was 28 months, but now he really can read thanks to this DVD. & with Let's go to the school, he learned finally the meaning of time: days, months, seasos, & even horas. No even talking about animals & their families...
I really I couldn't believe @ the beginning how much these DVDs saved me a lot of money in Speech therapy. His Speech therapists were so impresed w/his improvement in just one month that they started recommended these DVDs to all his clients. I particular bought the other 2 DVDs that Amazon is promoted (Math Circus & the Reading factory). And I also bought 2 sets of this collection as x-mas gifts: one for my 3 years old nephew (regular Neurotypical boy) & I donated the other one to a special need organization that provide free childcare when the parents are in seminary or meeting... I absolutely recommend this entire collection & any other DVD relates to it...",1260403200,57,1352,4.433734939759036
3949422,2,B002LYD2M6,"I thought that based on the new release date and the new pictures on the cases taht this was a remake of the letter factory and the talking words factory. I was very upset to learn that they are the same movie. I already have the others and didn't want or need them again. Amazon.com is usually very good about making sure their product descriptions are accurate, very dissapointed in them this time. Buyer be careful and make sure these are what you really want.",1260316800,23,463,4.458823529411765
3949423,5,B002LYD2M6,"As a family who owns quite a few educational DVDs I can attest to the fact that what LeapFrog is doing with their learning movies is both innovative and effective. Rather than focusing on repetitive drills, or straightforward simplistic presentation of facts accompanied by musical accompaniment, each of the DVDs included in the LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set integrates simple phonics and math principles into an engaging, and entertaining storyline. As a result, our children ask for the LeapFrog DVDs more often than they do any other educational offering we have available on disc.

The LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set incorporates three of LeapFrog's best titles for preschoolers and provides a comprehensive introduction to the basic preschool/kindergarten skills of letter recognition (short consonant and vowel sounds), basic blending, counting, and animal group recognition.

LeapFrog: Let's Go to School provides a typical storyline for allaying the fears of children on the cusp of attending a public school (of course, not all children will attend a public school). In a dream-like sequence Tad and Lilly discover that the school equipment is just as nervous about the incoming class as they are about attending. The blocks teach some basic counting skills, the alphabet book quickly goes through letter sounds, the calendar introduces time-telling concepts, the animal figurines teach about sorting and animal families, and so on. Because of the brief introductions given to each topic, this general overview is the weakest educationally of the set. Five sing-along songs and an interactive alphabet book are provided as additional reinforcing bonus features on the DVD.

However, LeapFrog: Letter Factory and LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory more than make up for the lack of depth by focusing in on introductory phonics and blending in DVDs of approximately 35 minutes each. In the first DVD Leap, Lily, and Tad need to go to their father's Letter Factory where they produce talking letters. While Leap and Lily provide a presentation for a very important customer, Tad is left out due to his lack of reading skills. Taken for a tour through the factory, he visits rooms, each dedicated to a letter of the alphabet. The colorful, animated letters are engaged in activities that embody their sound.

The A's scream, ""Aaaaaah!"" when frightened. The E's are hard of hearing and ask, ""Ehhhh?"" whenever someone speaks to them. The M's proclaim ""Mmmmm!"" as they devour delicious muffins. The set also includes a full set of alphabet flashcards that depict the lively letters in poses, settings, and costumes that represent their sounds on one side, and directions to parents on how to use the cards to teach their children on the other with a simpler representation of the letter.

In LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory Leap, Lily, and Tad are recruited to make more talking words for the very popular talking dictionaries, and to assist Tad in the filling out of a contest application for his father. Various fun machines make vowels sticky, wham words together, and more. Rhyming songs and a fun plot add to the appeal of this title. This is my six-year-old's favorite of the three - she loves the neat word machines and inventions. Both Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory include a simple, interactive learning game as educational reinforcement.

Created with children from ages two through six in mind, I was somewhat skeptical about the set's ability to reach younger children. However, the animated, cartoon-style adventures of Leap, Lily, and Tad have not only made her a fan, they've also been teaching her the building blocks of phonics! My six-year-old already has a firm understanding of the concepts presented in the set, but she has also really enjoyed the discs for the story alone, and reinforcement has never hurt anyone!

Our children are limited to bringing along one or two DVDs when we travel to visit relatives, and they often ask to bring their LeapFrog movies with them. Only a day or two after watching LeapFrog: Letter Factory, my three year old made an `s' with her wikki sticks and proudly hissed `Sssss, this letter says ssss, Mommy!"" Right on.

The LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set is an excellent first step into learning for preschool-aged children. If your little ones haven't had any exposure yet the building blocks of phonics and blending, I can't recommend this set enough. The associations are fun, lively, and easier to remember in the context of a story-based plot than they are through rote memorization alone. Above all, it's fun, bright, and engaging - everything a small child could ask for with all the educational value parents' love.",1259798400,246,4676,5.1272965879265096
3949424,4,B002LYD2M6,"My daughter will be going to preschool next year and I figured having her watch DVD's that are educational can help her prep for when the time to go to school comes. These dvd are fun to watch, capture your attention and get the job done. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the had been ""easier to get the message across"" so to speak. What I mean is, I wish that there was less distraction, less of a story line and more focus on the numbers & ABC's. I do still highly recommend this dvd set.",1259366400,,503,3.99009900990099

For the young, developing mind, that is not something that I liked repeated over and over in my childrens' ears and out of their mouths.

3949564,5,B002LYD2M6,Best way for kids to learn letters and their sounds. I heard about the letter factory from a family member and decided to buy the 3 DVD set since it was only a few dollars more. My 22 month old started watching the letter factory casually a few months ago and last month she got really into it. After just two weeks of watching it 1-3 times a day she could tell me every letter and its correct sound with only mixing up a few. She can recognize letters and she knows their sound even when you don't do them in order. It is all thanks to this DVD. We watched the let's go to school one a few times. She doesn't like it as much but she isn't really developmentally at that level yet. Haven't even opened the talking letter factory yet because she is too young but I have no doubt it will be just as good.,1488326400,2,802,4.050314465408805

Got this for my 3 year old daughter She knew her ABC but didn't seem interested in being able to identify them or anything beyond singing the song really. After watching one of the DVDs twice, she could identify probably 23/26 letters and knew the sounds they make. Winning!!! And she loves watching them, which is the most important. Only bad thing is the songs get stuck in my head. I already know my letters so its a bit annoying. But as long as my daughter loves it that's all that matters.

I've heard great things about this DVD set from my sister in-law, so I thought I'd try them out.  The set contains 3 DVDs.  One goes over the alphabet and numbers.  The other goes over letter sounds.  And the 3rd DVD goes over sounding out words.  I figured these DVDs would be great for them to watch while driving out of town instead of watching other movies...as I'm always looking for something more educational for them to do.  They absolutely love these videos!  They are catching on very quickly and now go around the house singing the songs and practicing the letter sounds.

3949699,5,B002LYD2M6,"The Letter Factory is so great! My son is 3.5 and has never really had an interest in learning letter recognition or sounds despite me trying to work with him/watching other educational shows. He could recognize and spell his name, but, beyond that he just didn't care.

He watched the Letter Factory once and was suddenly all about letters! He's watched it probably 5 times now and can recognize all of the letters. Even better, he knows the sounds of about half of them!!! It really has amazed me.

He's even interested in trying to write letters now!! This is a kid who has never once wanted to or been willing to color or draw for more than 30 seconds and now he wants to write (and he spends about an hour total throughout the day practicing)!!!!!!

I have not introduced him to the other two DVDs yet. He starts preschool in the fall so I am saving the School one until closer to that. And I am going to save the talking words one until he's a little further along on his letters. I have no doubts that the other two DVDs are good though.

Although he does love to sit down and listen to us read to him, he likes to watch his movies and sing along even more!

3949763,5,B002LYD2M6,"I was slightly skeptical when I ordered this DVD set, but the reviews were great and the price was right. Prior to purchasing this set, my son had zero interest on practicing his letters. It was extremely frustrating. Upon receiving the package I realized that not only did this set come with several DVDs but it also comes with flashcards. The Letter Factory movie is my son's absolute favorite. That DVD alone has helped significantly. He can now identify all of his letters and also tell you the sound every letter makes. His teachers were so impressed with how far he came in such a short time. Thank you LeapFrog for making such a great product!!!",1453507200,,652,4.629310344827586

I think watching it is helping to reinforce what I am trying to teach her about letters, plus she loves it and I can give her a little screen time without feeling guilty.

Caution: the songs are catchy... I catch myself singing them.

My daughter is too young for the other DVDs in the set but I will update when we get to them.",1452729600,,450,4.22093023255814

I did have the flash cards laminated so that they last a lot longer.

The other dvds were also hits but not quite as much as the letter factory.  I found them less effective..for example I felt that the ""let's go to school"" dvd had too much learning material crammed into it and it came across as unfocused.

the letter factory dvd was focussed on letters.  The school dvd was also interesting and fun to watch but it had too much going on.

I was worried they wouldn't capture his attention since he is a busy body and always needs to be doing something. I was surprised the first time he watched the Letter Factory DVD, and he sat through the entire DVD.  He was mimicking the letter noises on the first day.  He requests to watch these videos on a daily basis.  The Letter Factory DVD is his favorite by far.

After a week of watching the Letter Factory, he was able to name his letters and their sounds.  We already had letter flashcards, but the ones that came in the package really helped him associate each letter from the DVD to the letter on the flashcard.

We also purchased the PreSchool Prep series.  He enjoys the those as well for the shapes, colors, and numbers, but prefers the LeapFrog Letter Factory DVD for letter recognition and their sounds.

These videos have exceeded my expectations.  My only regret is that we did not purchase them sooner!",1390780800,,1088,4.5

I struggled to get my daughter to learn all of her sounds for reading.  I would use flash cards, and get very little done.  She would regress and not remember anything some days.  It was very frustrating, I thought she would never learn!  Then I got these dvds.
In one day, she knew all of the sounds.  In one day she 'got' it.  We got the cards which came with it, and went over them.  She knew them all.  She just has a different learning style I suppose.

I had never practiced letter sounds with him before this. After about 3 days, he knew all his sounds. Everywhere we go he is practicing his sounds. The song and animations are extremely helpful. There are games on the DVD as well. He has even started spelling words by sounding them out (and we're only a week into watching it)!!!  The flashcards have been amazing. We take them in the car with us. And I think they really helped to gain his interest in watching the movie the first time.  The school DVD is fun to watch. Although not as AMAZING as the letter factory, definitely good reinforcement for my son who has never been in daycare or preschool.  We've watched the Talking Words factory a couple times. It is really cute. It has helped him grasp the concept of words. he has learned his vowels.  These are must haves.

Great concept, got the attention of my 3 year old and he knows his letter sounds well now. This was a great asset in that process! The 'let's go to school' is OK, more story and reassurance that school is fun and what typical procedures are. The talking words factory is similar to the letter factory but builds words. Great for introducing that next step for older preschoolers preparing for Kindergarten.

3950078,5,B002LYD2M6,"Leapfrog products are so effective.  I first bought Word Factory about a year ago, which I found very good, however, it was at the time  too advanced for my 2 year old.  In the summer in preparing for Pre-School, I decided to get the Leapfrog DVDs as I bought several leapfrog toys and found them so educational. I had also bought other educational DVDs and found the Word Factory more engaging.

In a week, my son who could interestingly sound the alphabet but could not name them, could identify them.  The flashcards that came with the Learning DVD set was a big hit.  He would match the letters with the ones on the screen.  He then wanted to play the Alphabet Game.  He would hold up a card and we would take turns naming and sounding the letter; then he would turn it around and identify the capitalised and lower case versions of the letter.  He enjoys this and his face is aglow!  He is now writing the alphabet.  It is a delight to see the joy and excitement for learning.  He has watched the Letter Factory a hundred times or more, and this is no exaggeration!  He can identify it from his huge collection.

He is now ready for Word Factory.  He has picked up very well from the Word Factory, since he has been exposed to it for quite a while and since he knows all the letters and sounds. He will soon be reading. He has lots of books which he loves and this will only increase his love for reading and books.

I love the Let's Go to Preschool as it explores colours, shapes and numbers, however my son is more interested in the Letter Factory and Let's go to the Moon which is part of another Leapfrog Collection.

Letter Factory (teaches all the letters and sounds), Talking Words Factory (begins teaching phonetically sounding out and spelling words), and the flash cards (that have all the letters and symbols they have learned). Let's go to school is included as well, but I would have probably included Word Caper instead (it goes into blends, diagraphs, long and short vowels, and other complex words) Like some of the other reviewers said, there is one instance where Tad does lie and acts as if that's ok. That's the only issue I've seen with these particular dvds. Some of the other dvds don't seem as interesting as these and sometimes not as well paced (Math Circus, for example--and the duck lies on that one as well).

Like other reviewers I am a little disappointed that the content in this 2009 version is the same as the 2003 version.  Given the age of this DVD I'm hoping Leapfrog will release an all new ""Phonics factory"" cartoon correcting some of the earlier mistakes, namely:-

1) Letters in lower case please

Since rating this DVD, a month later after watching twice a week, my 27 month old son has learned all the alphabet both lower and upper case.  My son is no genius but wired to learn and along with motherly keenness the DVD has really helped.

He enjoyed the DVDs and would watch them over and over at least once or twice per day. Within 3 weeks of watching the ""Letter Factory"" and ""Talking Words Factory"" DVDs, he knew all 26 letters and their sounds. These DVDs are amazing!

The little flash card set that comes in the set came in handy. One side shows the letters while the other side depicts a scene from ""The Letter Factory"", sparking your child's memory to help them remember the sound made by the letter. I am so thankful for these DVDs and flash cards!! They have really made a huge difference for my son.",1320364800,,743,4.423357664233577

She squeals with delight when she sees me pull out any of these dvd's. I highly recommend this set to any parent, for any child over a year old.

In the letter factory, a young kid and a professor go room to room, seeing a short story about the sound each letter makes, reinforced by a short song about the letter, and the letter shown in upper and lower case. The videos are also a good length, long enough to be worth getting, short enough for a kid to watch in one sitting.

The other two movies are good too, but if you only get one of these, make sure you get the Letter Factory!",1319155200,,605,4.298245614035087

3950109,5,B002LYD2M6,"As my son was headed to Pre-K, he had not shown a great interest in learning letters or sounds.  We had done lots of activities to spark an interest, but it never lasted long and we hadn't gotten very far.  A friend recommended the Letter Factory DVD after her son had learned all of his letters and sounds by watching it.  I was HESITANT to go in the DVD direction to do this, but I knew it would motivate him because he does love to watch TV (even though he only watches 1-2 hours a week)and I thought this would be a great way to make those minutes more valuable than just entertainment.
I am so glad I didn't let my hesitation get the better of me because within a week, he knew all of the letter sounds.  The letter names took a little bit longer, maybe 3 weeks.  He LOVED practicing with the flashcards that came with it. I liked that the flashcards had the visual from the DVD on one side and the standard type on the back.  The flashcards also have all sorts of extension ideas for each of the letters, like making the letter with your body, naming something that you wear that starts with the letter, etc.  As a reading teacher, these ""real world"" connections are so important in developing true understanding.
He has now started watching the Word Factory and is already starting to sound out words.  He has also picked up on rhyming from watching the DVD.  He takes a lot of pride in knowing and sounding out letters and words and it was all sparked from watching the DVDs and practicing with the flashcards.
The only thing that I didn't love with the Letter Factory was the pronunciation of the ""L"" sound.  It was more of an ""uhl"" sound instead of just an ""L"".  I may be picky because I'm a reading teacher.  I was really happy that most of the letters that are sometimes incorrectly said with an extra sound  ""duh"" for D, ""buh"" for B)were said correctly in the video.
Overall, I couldn't be happier with the results of the DVDs. My son still sings the songs from the Letter Factory and his 16 month old sister is catching on!  Truly a great investment if you want to give your child a head start in reading!",1318377600,,2119,4.318181818181818

I'm buying more now because my son is proof they work.

To be honest, there were even some letters, like G, J and V that he even used to get confused with and forget what they were.  That has all changed in a couple of weeks.  Check out his video below.

My 3 year old even knows all his letters now by sight (upper case) and is starting to sound them out. My five year old is starting to understand what vowels are! The way the information is presented is very visual and silly - a format that kids understand. ie: In ""Talking Words Factory,"" the vowels in the ""factory"" (shown in big red uppercase letters) go through a car wash - type scenario and become ""sticky"" as to show how vowels are the glue that hold words together. In ""Letter Factory,"" each letter has funny costumes and voices that emulate its sound (phonics). GREAT DVD set for teaching pre-schoolers and Kindergarteners.

I am so shocked that after a few viewings she was so enthusiastic about this and how it is helping her development. Forget Baby Einstein or any overpriced DVDs that claim to help your child. This is the only set of DVDs that has actually delivered results and she doesn't even get tired of it.

3950144,5,B002LYD2M6,"I'm very happy with this purchase. Although I'm a fan of Leapfrog Leapster2 and Explorer, I never ever taught of buying these Leapfrog DVD's, or even the corresponding Explorer/Leapster2 games. Simply because I wasn't familiar with the characters.

Somehow the characters (Tad and Lilly) on the covers of the games and DVD's, and the whole cover itself, did not appeal to me. Nor to our son, since he never asked for any of them. It seemed perhaps a bit too ""scholastic"" to me, I guess. Not interesting enough. With all the popular characters from TV and movies around, like SpongeBob, Penguins of Madagascar, Go Diego Go, Cars, Toy Story, etc. etc.., these games and dvd's certainly did not jump out to me. I taught our son would not be much interested in these simple frog-like scholastic characters while all those very popular characters are available.

So it never ever even cross my mind to get nor a game or a dvd of these characters. Till one day, one very good day, I got a mail from Amazon with a deal on this set. The deal was very good, so I decided to go ahead and try it anyway. Although I had the feeling that this good very well be just waisted money, since our son (just 6) would probably not be very interested in it anyway. Especially since he's pretty much into SpongeBob lately. But since it was 3 dvd's for a very good deal, I decided to go for it anyway.

Thank you so much Amazon! If it weren't for your deal, I would never ever get any of these dvd's, nor look at the games of Tad and Lilly. Now I'm thinking quite different. Here's why. Any dvd or character that wins over SpongeBob, is a hero to me! At the moment we got these dvd's, our son was very much into SpongeBob. He has a couple of SpongeBob dvd's and lately it has been the only thing he's watching. He was watching the same SpongeBob dvd's each and every day. Sometimes even over and over on the same day. Also on tv looking for when SpongeBob would be on.

So when I got these dvd's, I really had very low hope, he would be interested in them. Actually no hope at all. But boy, was I wrong. I still can't believe it, and actually I don't really understand it either. I mean SpongeBob is quite an interesting character. Extremely entertaining, especially to kids, but with no educational value whatsoever, unless of course incorporated in an educational game. But I say again on TV and dvd,... no educational value.

So how could Tad and Lilly win over SpongeBob dvds??? I don't know. Beats me. But they did. When I received these dvd's at home, I told our 6 year old, we were going to watch something different today. I showed him the covers of the new dvds, and he was slightly interested, since they were new. But once we played the 1st dvd of the set, he was not interested in SpongeBob anymore. At least not for now. It has been two weeks now and the only thing he's been watching are these Tad and Lilly dvd's. The Letter Factory one is his favorite for now and the one he's watching over and over. He's very exited about the letters, the words, the songs, the story line,... and he's learning a lot. Imagine my surprise (for putting SpongeBob aside) and my excitement (for him to be really learning and having fun at the same time).

The flash cards that came with the set are also great. He loves them, and plays a lot with them. Repeating what he learned from each letter from the dvds, singing the songs, and making words! We are really happy with this set of dvd.

Now I'm already looking for the other dvds from Leapfrog and also the Leapster2/Explorer games of Tad and Lilly.",1300579200,,3576,4.400907715582451

Although a child wouldn't need to know the letters first, since they teach that along with the sounds.  My daughter has consistantly enjoyed watching The Letter Factory and she's even enjoyed Talking Words Factory.  I'm not sure if she liked the Let's Go to School DVD since I think she was ""T.V.'d"" out when she watched it.  The songs on these DVDs are great and stick in your head! I find myself singing the sounds of the letters with her while we're getting her ready for bed or in the car or at play dates.

My daughter also really enjoyed the addition of the letter flashcards. As she watches the show she goes through the cards and finds the letter, then makes the sound.

But when he turned 2 he started retaining everything on tv, so I figured: ""Why not be retaining something more worthwhile than the names of all of Manny's tools?"" After some research, I decided against the ""Your Baby Can Read"" videos because 1. They're insanely expensive, and 2. They look boring for this age group.

I'm so glad I went with these Leapfrog videos instead! Not only are they really affordable, but the accompanying flash cards- my son LOVES playing with. Within 2-3 views he was picking up letters and telling me their sounds on his own! And bonus- the letter factory songs match the ""Leapfrog Fridge Magnet"" set... so when he plays with them its just reinforcing what he's learned.

Now when we're grocery shopping I can just pick out large letters and he gets to tell me their sounds. He's so proud of himself and thinks letters are a big game. What more could I ask for? I am sure that Kindergarten (in the far future) will be a cinch because of these videos. He asks for them and enjoys them and I just follow his lead!

All of my friends are so impressed, they're ordering it for their kids too. This is the best kept secret in letter learning, I'm convinced!",1297555200,3,1244,4.47136563876652

My nanny then explained to me that he now recognizes some of the letters and their sounds.

My son is now almost 17 months, and he knows a lot of the letters and or the sounds they make, and he gets so excited when he sees them during our walks, in the newspapers, on Jeopardy, on books, etc...

This past Christmas she got a Leap Frog game system, which she loves & while looking for a new module, I came across these DVD's, which I thought I'd give one more chance.

What a fabulous surprise!!

If you are looking for something that works try this series by Leap Frog ...they are entertaining and yet my granddaughter who already know her letters & numbers, after watching the first time learned a word, by the second viewing she had figured out the blending of words ...

She actually tells me it's ""School Time"" and puts in the DVD for me.

Today she picked out a word from the TV and said ""Nana guess what T..O..Y..spells (it was a Disney ad for Toy Story)...then she said toy. That is the beginning of reading ...she understands!!

I was able to use that knowledge and change the way I was trying to help her recognize her letters. I would say the letter sound first, then the letter and that has helped.
