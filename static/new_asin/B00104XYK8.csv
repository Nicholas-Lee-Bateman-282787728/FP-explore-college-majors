8237183,1,B00104XYK8,I received a CD that was poorly manufactured and skipped and had dead space. Two words quality control. What good is the diet lite version of a product that is broken. Oh and you get some free poorly made extras. If all the short programs are like this then it's a total waste of time and money. I would have been better off spending my money on the old used CD's as they at least were quality copies. I have the full version of get the edge and this is just a tiny single bit of that information. I thought it would be nice to get for a coworker but I was disappointed. Time of your life I got one DVD and one broken CD of an entire program so you really don't get much of that information either. I would say that it was not worth the $20 I paid for it. Who wants to go through the hassle to RMA a $20 item and pay for shipping. Please in this day of the information age you should just be able to download this so at least you get a good copy. The full programs are fantastic and I recommend them but not these.,1253577600,,1014,3.951219512195122
