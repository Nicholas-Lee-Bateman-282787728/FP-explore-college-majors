4518376,5,B0050UEVKK,"If you are a fan of the series you owe it to yourself to watch this, simple as that. In my opinion Paradise Lost ended the amazing story behind Eden of the East on a very realistic note; something some might not appreciate, but to me that's what this whole series was about; how feasible such an outrageous demand  as ""fix the country"" could be. If you truly enjoyed the original 11-episode series and The King of Eden, you will be pleased by the continuation and how it evolves.

I'm by no means an expert on the series or an avid reviewer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt; I'm merely talking as an Anime fan and as someone who loves this series.",1314403200,,655,4.232
4518377,2,B0050UEVKK,"I was a big fan of the show, or at least the first 2/3 of it or so. The series is animated beautifully, and revolves around a very compelling question we all ask ourselves: given the ability, how would you fix your country?

The movie leading up to this one, King of Eden, was practically a repeat of the plot device used in earlier episodes, except with less of a journey of discovery, less interesting characters being introduced, and a general sense of waiting around before anything important to the happens plot-wise.

I wanted badly for this series to go out with a bang by returning what made this series great to start with: the suspense, the plans that come together over time, the confrontation with other characters given the same opportunity, even the romantic development.

But I can't forgive this movie. There's a lack of compelling narrative, climax, character development, or satisfying resolution. There's no indication that the events of the movie has a meaningful impact on anyone. The main character's childhood experience is covered again. It doesn't lead to an epiphany, the topic just gets dropped later on. There's no confrontation with an antagonist, no obstacle to overcome, just a few travels, a few conversations and a mouthpiece to voice vague speeches about two of the character's hopes for Japan. I would recommend this only to people that were major fans the series and 1st movie.",1308355200,30,1413,4.928571428571429
4518378,4,B0050UEVKK,"*Spoilers Ahead*... do NOT read if you do not want to know how it ends.

Same as Joshua Adair's review, please do not bash me. There are some very emotional ppl out there when it comes to these things, so just try to accept the fact that a review can contain an opinion that is different from yours.

This review is for the entire series, not just the last movie.

I, also, loved this series. It has it's flaws, one of them (for me) was a bit inexcusable, but I still say it is worth the time and effort to watch this series and the subsequent movies.

First, the pros; the animation is breathtaking - drool-worthy, beautiful, can't-take-your-eyes-off-it type of thing. One of my favorite things about EotE's look is the choice in color palette. As an artist myself, I know how tough it is to select - and then stick to - a palette. It can literally make of break your piece. Some very wise choices were made here. There was just enough effort made in ""effects"" (if you can call them that - animation is one big effect, but still), realism, NON-realism, and cartoony-style humor. The animation was almost my favorite aspect of EotE.

The characters were without a doubt my favorite part. They were fleshed out nicely and a perfect mix. I loved the personality differences expressed between each version of Juiz, based on which Selecao 'she' was assigned to. The Eden team was hysterical and, frankly, very believable.

The other Selecaos were a pleasant mix of the frightening, spoiled, odd, powerful and sweet. The Johnny Hunter still fascinates me - I can never reconcile her actions but I can totally sympathize with her cause. Plus, let's face it, she kind of kicks a$$ in the style department.

Saki was adorable, she was plucky and willing to invest time in a huge risk (Akira himself) without being too much of a pushover, too emotional, or the warriorette. Nothing is wrong with any of those roles, but they would not have done opposite Akira. She was his perfect compliment.

Akira himself is one of the most charming anime characters to come along in awhile. He gets a bit flighty at times (let's see how *you* behave after two memory wipes!!) but he is so endearing that you have no choice but to forgive him. He is clearly interested in Saki - not just she's The Cute Girl That Helped Me, but it's obvious he's looking out for her well-being and wants her to stay near him even if he can't figure out why. Is he interested enough? I fear we will never know. He is compassionate, easy-going, tenacious, adorable, adventurous and intelligent. What more can you want in a lead?

I have only ever seen this in the original Japanese with subtitles, so I will be interested to see how well I like the English soundtrack. I usually have trouble finding enough emotional resonance with the Japanese soundtrack (only because I am sure such a thing is more subtle than English, and I simply don't know enough Japanese to 'hear' it) and I opt to listen to the English. But, I can tell you one thing for sure - Akira's voice actor is without a doubt my favorite male Japanese voice actor so far. So much so, that if I find the english actor lacking when I buy the series, I will not listen to him. I will let nothing ruin Akira. Nothing.

The plot does have it's similarities to other animes, and especially books/movies like the Jason Bourne series. But there is nothing new under the sun children, EVER, and for my money when the series is as engaging and creative as this, I say who cares? if it's good, it doesn't matter how many times it's been done. I was very happy with the reconciliation at the end of Paradise Lost regarding the politics and the NEETs, the future of most of the characters and especially Taki's confrontation with Mr. Outside - which was perfectly in character with him! It was just enough revenge for our hero, and, consequently, just enough for us. The open-ended aspect of the entire ending was absolutely appropriate to the subject matter - there are no perfect answers with a problem this big, it says, but we have to keep trying.

Now for what I did not like about the end. Yes, it was the resolution between Akira and Saki's relationship. Without giving away too much, I believe my problem with it is one of two things: Either the translation from the Japanese to the English subs somehow missed the inflection of the plot, OR, it is the basic rule that if you are a pessimist, you saw it one way, and the opposite if you are an optimist.

I am definitely a pessimist...

This is hard for me to explain, but at the risk of inciting fan-girl flames, I'm going to try. Did he ever go back to her as promised? I don't think he did. After some of Saki's rather final-sounding narration, and Akira's flighty nature when he said goodbye, and the total lack of any visual indication he went back, and especially Saki's very, VERY last line of dialogue, I do not think he made good on his promise to her. Maybe saving Japan has him too busy now, or the fool went and had another memory wipe, or maybe he finds himself too dangerous and is simply protecting her by staying away? I am not sure. It was almost as though he truly wanted to be Saki's guy in the series (even as he knew she needed to get over her bro-in-law, and even as he was willing to show the Johnny Hunter some real affection). But then in King of Eden (after the second memory wipe, mind you), he liked being near Saki, but he couldn't figure out why. But by the end of Paradise Lost, Taki-chan left me feeling like... ok, yeah, I'll say it: He's just not that into her (anymore?). Well, Ugh! You build me up then give me that?! *sigh*

That aspect of the plot left me cold & wanting. It is the ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. You want so badly for them to be together - not for a story book romance crap ending, I hate that stuff - but because they are just so good together that you get addicted to 'them'. Who knows, if I can find it in my heart to be more optimistic, I may come back and upgrade that rating.  ;)  But don't hold your breath.

Don't get me wrong, I still loved this anime. And I will watch it over and over like I did with Samurai Champloo. I admit the series was more engaging than the movies, but that was nothing more than a timing thing, and the part of the ending that I hate... well, I truly, REALLY hate it.

But... I loved it, and can't wait to get all my copies.",1306886400,26,6399,4.385654008438818

I feel it is mainly due to the fact that the show built up intrigue and complexity and then the company decided to cram in their message and ending into a pair of movies as opposed to a proper second season. An OVA or two would be great to conclude the series for good(not holding my breath). It reminds me strongly of the ending to the original Fullmetal Alchemist.

The series was fantastic. But the two movies not so much.

Promised the protagonist becoming King or prince, never happened.
Promised to declare winner, ended up declaring everyone winner. Completely lost intensity of the game in the movies, changed the rules midway, no more death for losers. Then #1 and #9 decided to work together. Why would a weak speech and 1 yen make the country better?
Promised romance: never happened.
No more fresh ideas: memory wipe again, lost passport again, coming to America again,
Pointless plots: Taki's mother, driving around Juizes 1 and 9, the whole wild goose chase about illegitimate son, why would that make the guy better suited to be a king?

4518452,3,B0050UEVKK,"I decided to buy and look into this anime (and its two feature-length movie continuations) for two reasons: one, the animation looked gorgeous, and two, the plot sounded very intriguing and original. While I can say that it did fulfill both of those expectations, it didn't quite reach the heights it seemed like it could have.

I won't spoil anything here and I won't bother giving a plot synopsis because you can read it on here already; what I will say is that the mysteries are all enticing at first, but like so many mysteries, the answers don't live up to the questions. After learning the truth behind the plot, I was excited for where the show could go with it, but it... didn't, really.

The plot sort of fumbles along without really taking advantage of the tools it's set up, and in the end it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. The two sequel movies are absolutely necessary if you care at all about the story or closure, but even with them you'll probably feel disappointed. This is simply my opinion, however - you may find something here that I didn't.

On the plus side, the characters are pretty great (except for the protagonist during ""King of Eden"", who is very lacking in personality for that movie only for reasons that will be clear if you watch it), and their interactions are very real. The mystery, while it lasts, is intriguing enough to keep you watching to learn more, even if you're ultimately unsatisfied with the denouement. The animation and artwork are beautiful and the music is good enough.

Overall, I think that Eden of the East is worth a watch for those curious, but not worth a purchase unless you just really take to it. It's an entertaining enough ride, but at the end of the day it never reaches the heights or importance of ""Ghost in the Shell"" despite purporting to be similar, and so it's best enjoyed as one would enjoy something like the ""Bourne"" movies - an entertaining but ultimately shallow experience that's fun while it lasts, but leaves little impact.",1353715200,,2003,4.649717514124294

4518454,5,B0050UEVKK,"Let me start with saying, as old as it may make me sound, that it has been years since I have been able to watch an anime and after turning off the TV still be thinking about it.  Most of the more recent things I have seen trickling across to the states has been mindless violence, fan service, and action shows with little to no substance besides the bright colors flashing on the screen.  However, the synopsis for the first episode of Eden of the East was so out there that I had to give it a try.

The first episode explains so little that you do keep watching. I grew interested in the characters and the plot.  I found myself thinking about the show as I went about my day.  Having lived in Japan I can say they did hit the nail on the head when discussing the multitude of problems in Japanese society.  The cruel working system, the lingering caste mentality that some people are inherently ""above"" others, the sick perverted men, and people's hesitance to say what they actually mean.  These are brushed upon in the show.

My main qualm with the series is that it's just too short, but this is not the writers' fault.  Economic concerns have robbed us of what could have been many many episodes of this wonderful show.  I would have loved them to devote at least a few episodes to each Selecao.  But with their time and budget I think they did a wonderful job.  The pacing is good and the scenes blend well from humorous to serious to touching and sometimes just bizarre.

4518457,4,B0050UEVKK,"This is ""Paradise Lost,"" the second movie, and the third and final part of ""Eden of the East"" over all. Make no mistake, you have watch the first movie, or else it'll be impossible to keep up with what's happening.

The short version is, I like it. It's an ending, and after the first movie was just treading water, it felt good to finally see the plot seriously moving forward. I did have to watch it twice to really grasp what was happening. There's a subplot that goes no where, and the plot is still entrenched in Japanese politics. What EXACTLY makes the ""Japanese Home Ministry"" so bad, or that tax that was proposed is lost on me. But, on the positive side, the resolution technically makes sense. Sorta. In that Japanese way.

So, if you've already bought the first two parts of the series, I recommend this movie. I liked it better than ""King of Eden.""

Now, the long version is Eden of the East was at it's core a battle between Takizawa and Mononobe, and if you were paying attention, you could see this coming. Considering all those who were eliminated during the series and first movie, there could only be one logical conclusion.

In hindsight, the movies are bogged down by the ""Make me king,"" request. Firstly, I think they meant, ""Get me elected Prime Minster of Japan."" Second, I think Taki's too young to be a candidate for PM. Third, what are his actual qualifications? The subplot about Taki's mom goes nowhere, and they expect us to believe one to many coincidences. And it amounts to nothing over all.

The core conflict is Mononobe trying to frame Eden of the East, Takizawa and the 20,000 NEETs as terrorists. His plan is the 9/11 conspiracy: incite chaos, use the aftermath to pass your own agenda. It's so relatable and it's empowering to see our ""savior"" defeat the politician at every turn.

Like I said, I like it because it's a reasonable ending, but I can see people disliking all the fake drama that haunt the movies. If you haven't spent money on the series, I say give it time. It'll be cheaper later. But, if you've already got the first two parts, maybe keep in mind what I said and maybe you'll enjoy it better. Maybe.

4518459,4,B0050UEVKK,"I really like what happens during the course of the anime, with the King of Eden continuing what happened at the end of the series, and sets up the story for the conclusion in Paradise Lost. We finally get to find out who the final salecao's are and who Mr. Outside really is.

I have to say the animation is really good in this anime, and the CG effects they have mix well with the awesome animation. I think they did a really good job on drawing the characters, and they don't default to the typical anime huge eyes and fan service. They did a real good job in making the characters different and not the same clone as everyone else.

The music fits the anime well, and pulls you right into the story. Along with that you have a fantastic English dub that doesn't sound like a knife to a blackboard, like some of the worse Anime's out there. I have to say though, Funimation is starting to become a really good company, and they are even picking up Anime's that previous companies canceled for translation (like .hack//quantum), so it's nice helping sustain the industry with good anime.

The package comes with a DVD and Blu-ray, in a case with a cardboard slip cover. The DVD/Blu-ray has awesome drawings on them, and around the DVD has the famous Juis quote at the end of any request a Salecao makes. I currently don't have a blu-ray player, but the quality of picture the DVD has is outstanding, and I'm sure the blu-ray has perfect HD. The main special feature is a commentary, which has the cast being asked questions throughout the movie at key moments that their characters had. Also comes with the trailers that Eden of the East, King of Eden, and Paradise Lost had, with some other random anime trailers.

I have to say the story had a nice little conclusion to the plot, but one part did annoy me. I'm not going to say that part due to spoilers, but some people may get annoyed with it as well. Even with that I say pick this movie up if you watched the last two releases this anime has so you can finally finish the great story this anime provides.

I am a huge fan of the series and watched everything. But I have to say I was expecting more from the movie which was supposed to conclude this epic anime. Unlike the series or the king of eden movie, it felt a little too crammed like as if they felt they had to end it with this movie so we were just shown with lots of info about everyone and the plot. But at the same time I felt there was lots of stuff missing like the other selecao. It was also ''less fun'', much heavier tone in the story then the previous episodes and film. Im kinda frustrated at the director for not properly ending this. At the end after credits, takizawa finally meets the darn supporter and suggests that he has some plans which might help the country. That left an opening for a continuation of the series but so far no plans have been announced. A shame really since this series deserves way more than 11 episodes and 2 movies. The story here is enough for at least 3-5 seasons. However, the director Kenji has recently released a short film called Xi Avant as a cellphone commercial for ntt docomo which kinda follows in the same path as eden of the east. The character design and even vooices from the series are similar and the characters appear to have the same type of cellphones with a Juiz like concierge(voiced by the same juiz). Instead of Selecao we have this slogan which says ''welcome to the pistol head''. Again perhaps another association which follows in the footsteps of selecao. However no plans on releasing a full series on this idea which is another huge shame. I really hope a continuation on eden of the east happens.",1321747200,,1632,4.443333333333333

The second film follows right up where the first movie left off with Akira leaving for Japan to face the music and many enemies. Saki joins him and soon they are neck deep in a national conspiracy.

The second and final film is outstanding both in story delivery and solid animation. The Eden group is being framed as the terrorists behind Careless Monday and they are trying to find a way to stop it and help Akira. It is a difficult thing to do when they are suddenly fugitives on the run. Meanwhile Akira is busy trying to find out if he is truly the Prime Minister's son and at the same time try to keep a step ahead of the diabolical Mononobe. The other Selecao are still around and the game for king is still on. However it seems to come down to Mononobe and Akira. The countdown is on, everyone is getting ready to make their final moves and another missile strike may be ready to launch.

The suspense of the film is well done, excellent writing and character development. The twists and turns are alluring, the way the film plays out is riveting. By the end of the movie a lot of questions are answered, the Selecao competition comes to an end and Akira has one last, insane gambit to play.

Anyone who enjoyed the introspective and interweaving politics and personal plights found in Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex will appreciate and enjoy Eden of The East. Fans of the Eden series will be thrilled by the final film. Be sure to wait until the very end of the credits to make sure you catch the whole story.

No doubt a great deal of the quality of the Eden of the East series and films are due to the anime `dream team' of writer and director Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell SAC and Ghost in the Shell 2nd Gig), Chica Umino as Original Character Concept (Honey and Clover), music director Kenji Kawai (Patlabor), and animation studio Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor, xxxHolic, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles).  The animation is soft of the eyes and smooth and fluid to watch. The score is sublime, beautifully accentuating the films many moods and scenes as they arise.

EXTRAS:
Bonus features are many and include trailers of other FUNimation titles, original Japanese TV spots, theatrical trailers for the two Eden of the East movies, original Japanese preview of movie 2, Eden of the East TV series trailer, interview with Director Kenji Kamiyama, and audio commentary throughout the movie with Mike McFarland (ADR Director and Line Producer) joined at different times by the various English voice cast from the second film throughout the movie.

IN SUMMARY:
Eden of the East Movie 2 Paradise Lost is an outstanding follow up and finale to the Eden of the East series. A superb anime experience!",1321228800,,2755,4.654320987654321

The animation is decent by today's standards, not Ghost in the Shell quality, but passable. The storyline is what turned me off. Unfocused and at times silly. I expected a story on par with the Ghost in the Shell series and I was disappointed that this disc fell flat. IMO, save your money. Anime is dead.

4518469,4,B0050UEVKK,"*This has some spoilers of any eden of the east series, and the kind of eden movie*
I give the original series 4.5 stars, and the king of eden 3 stars.

Now I thought the original series ended beautifully. I'm not a fan of using amnesia as a plot device. But the way the original series built around it was great. Now King of Eden, though I enjoyed, used the amnesia plot device to its detriment. And Made you partially retread what the original series already did. And set Takizawa and Saki's relationship at the start again.

This movie, was about as good as it could have been. It built from the king of eden, logically, but not necessarily predictably. With an ending that might upset people. But, to me it was uneasily satisfying.",1314576000,,735,4.477611940298507
