4467364,5,B004UJN216,"We saw part 1 and found it captivating.  So we decided to rent part 2 and we like it a lot.  Both parts 1 and 2 are full of action and drama, an epic from a different time.  It has a lot of tradition, loyalty and treachery in war, friendships and even romance.  We watched these in segments because they are long, but intense and interesting.",1391817600,,342,4.136363636363637
4467365,4,B004UJN216,"Not being familiar with the history and myths of Siam, I could have been led astray, but the clothing and weapons seemed to fit with the period, the plot and the acting was good, so I now have a feel for what that part of the world was like a couple centuries ago.
No, I don't understand the language, I read the subtitles. I enjoy listening to the voices, so I prefer this to dubbing in English.",1363737600,,396,4.1558441558441555

4467367,5,B004UJN216,"This is the second of the Kingdom of War's series of three movies.  The first movie (released in 2003) is about the main character (Prince) taken as hostage in childhood, and raised by a monk to learn about ethics and the job of being a king.  This second movie (released in 2007) is about the prince being an adult warrior--an epic movie--with lots of excellent war scenes.  What's also good about the second movie is that his partner in crime (assistant) has a really great love story in the movie.  The acting was excellent and makes you feel for the love relationship his assistant has with a princess, and you realize that the main character prince would be a great king one day.  The epic scenes are almost as good as any other epic films such as Lord of the Rings and other ancient war movies.  After watching the second one, I looked desperately for part three (released in 2011).  This series made me appreciate Thailand and its people's history.  You learn about kingdoms, feuds and the importance of a person's character.",1343692800,4,1032,4.631868131868132

8441616,5,B004UJN216,"I somehow found Kingdom of War Part I and Part II after watching Ong Bak II and III.  I don't know if the later wetted my appetite for the former but the story of Prince Naresuan's later life kept my interest for the almost 3 hours of this film.  Watching the full movie, almost 5 hours, kept my interest enough not to realize how long the entire movie is.",1475539200,,356,4.144927536231884
