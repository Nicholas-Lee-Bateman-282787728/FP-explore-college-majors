It is truly remarkable that the tiny island of Cuba is more responsible for African independence and the end of apartheid than any other nation on Earth. As the film begins; the first nation that Nelson Mandela visited following his release after 27 years in a South African prison was Cuba. It was Cuba and Fidel that created the conditions for his release and for the eventual dismantling of apartheid throughout the continent. In particular, nearly half-a-million Cubans volunteered to fight for African independence, not because they were forced to, not because they sought Africa's natural resources, not because they sought to occupy and exploit the continent and its people or use it as a pawn in some grand geopolitical strategy, but solely because they believed Africans deserved to be free of colonialism and they, the Cubans, could help them achieve it. It is also shameful that the United States consistently supported the forces of oppression and apartheid. We should not forget that Ronald Reagan called Mandela a ""terrorist"" and vetoed any and all legislation condemning apartheid and calling for US divestment from South Africa. This documentary also gives the lie to the notion that Cuba was little more than a pawn manipulated by the USSR. We Americans are force-fed lies, distortions and misinformation about Cuba more than any other nation, and have been for a half-century. This DVD is a chance to get the truth. You will be awed and inspired by Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and, most importantly, by the Cuban people themselves.",1220400000,4,1660,5.084249084249084

This work features interviews in English, Russian, Spanish, French, and even Portuguese.  Sadly, this work that focuses on Central Africa does not have any interviewees speaking in indigenous languages.

Recently, I saw a PBS special on the Spanish-American war in which it is recalled how little Americans in the late 19th century knew about Cuba.  Here, you see Cubans in the mid- to late 20th century having little information about Central Africa.  Years ago, I saw a documentary in which an African leader from a nation that has done laudable work in fighting HIV said Castro was the cause.  He said when Cuban officials learned that 1/3 of the African volunteer soldiers who visited the island were HIV-positive Castro sat him down and encourage him to do something about it.  I really think students and scholars who have equal interest in Cuba and Africa, or who are pan-Africanists, would greatly appreciate this work.

Cuban actions to protect the struggles of African people to achieve independence and to protect their independence is heroic and more people should become aware of their valiant struggle with African freedom movements.,1441756800,,445,4.986486486486487

8249672,3,B0013B34XU,"I was not going to write a review of this interesting documentary because another reviewer ""Mark"" had already done an excellent review, but seeing that two persons have been so critical of his review, I have decided to enter the fray. I should know something of this topic, not only as an area of my own historic expertise, but also as one my favorite uncles was conscripted in the Cuban army and was a participant in this Cuban adventure, serving honorably in Angola.

This documentary should have been entitled Cuba- African adventurism and combat by proxy in the superpower conflict during the cold war.

This is a well-done but terribly biased documentary that glorifies communist Cuba and her heroes in the repressive pantheon of the workers' paradise. Part 1 of this documentary relates to the Congo and the war for independence from Belgium. Then it proceeds with the struggle for power between communist Patrice Lumumba, who is idolized, and his successor, Laurent Kabila, against (Joseph) Mobutu Sese Seko (1930-1997), who eventually won and ruled with an iron hand as a socialist dictator.

Then Che Guevara enters the picture in this Congolese civil war and despite a hero-worship tribute treatment of this communist icon, the producers are forced to admit that Che's misadventure was a disastrous and colossal failure. We are not told that, if there was a real communist hero, it was General Arnaldo Ochoa, who rescued Che from the claws of his enemies in 1965, when, while in full retreat the Argentinean got lost and nearly perished trying to reach Lake Tanganyika, his desperate escape route. General Ochoa, who later became a potential political opponent of Fidel Castro, was accused of drug smuggling and shot in Cuba as a scapegoat after a kangaroo trial in 1989.

Token Americans are used to give the documentary a semblance of balances- namely CIA operatives, such as Larry Devlin, who must admit to his cloak and dagger operations, etc. But the glorification of the war against neocolonialism and the exaltation of communist heroes, both Cuban and African-- not just the big fish like Lumumba and Che Guevara, but also smaller, life-size heroes, such as Victor Dreke and Harry Villegas, assistants to Che Guevara who actually do some of the narration. This communist glorification is all pervasive in the documentary.

It is highly ironic (although the producers failed to see the irony) that when the Cuban revolutionaries entered the Congo, Victor Dreke, a black Cuban was given the nom de guerre ""Moya,"" and the Congolese were told that he was the supreme ""Commander of the Congo Mission."" They were astounded and in awe because ""Moya"" was black and ranked higher than the two white Cubans (of course it was a lie, one of the two whites was Che, nom de guerre, ""Tatu""!) After Che's identity was ascertained, the astonishment pass unnoticed. Che was then worshiped as a demigod and they were afraid for his safety and that ""something"" might happened to him. Nothing was said of the brutality of his African comrades, tribal warfare, to the point that Che himself was revolted by their African confreres' barbarism.

Part 2 deals Cuba's major involvement in the collapse of the Portuguese African colonies in Angola and Mozambique. Nothing is said of the major role played by the left-wing Portuguese military junta which actually was the biggest player in that collapse. Withdrawal of colonial troops  from the Portuguese colonies by the sympathetic, left-wing junta facilitated the work of the African national liberation movements in Cabo Verde, Mozambique, and Angola in 1975. Selective omissions like this favoring the leftist revisionism, unfortunately haunt this documentary.

I also agree with ""Mark"" that in the Angola war, the communist MPLA were treated as heroes, while the U.S.-supported UNITA fighters were insufficiently covered, intimating only that they were U.S. puppets! You would never know that Dr Jonas Savimbi was the greatest guerrilla and military leader in both that war, as well as the war for independence of Angola, nor that he was assassinated in 2002 still fighting!

I am also in accord with this reviewer about the venial situation of the Angolan communist regime and Western oil companies propping up the corrupt regime and accepting protection from the Cuban army in the oil fields. This is not discussed, I suppose, because it would taint the revolutionary image of Agostinho Neto, head of the MPLA and later communist dictator of Angola.

In short, this documentary was well-researched, had good footage, but it was tremendously one-sided, exalting the heroes of the communist pantheon, at times even omitting inconvenient facts that would oppose the leftist perspective of the producers. Finally the documentary failed to tell the viewers the corruption (Angola), depredation (Mozambique) and even genocidal perversity (Ethiopia, the Derg, and Mengistu Haile Marian) that the Cuban communist troops, the Soviets, and African socialism- left in their wake. You will not see the atrocities of African communists in this documentary only exaltation of Cuba's adventurism in Africa during the cold war. By all means watch it but only after the viewer has done some reading on this topic, so that he or she is prepare to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Dr. Miguel A. Faria is the author of Cuba in Revolution-Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002). He has written extensively on Cuba and Soviet Communism.",1326067200,6,5460,5.11672278338945
8249673,5,B0013B34XU,"This gives another view of History not being told and taught completely. History can't and should never be told one sided. It shows how people and some parts of the world are being used and have always being used as PUPPETS by West (all countries from the Northern or western hemisphere that have nothing to do, surely not selling arms and death tools to Africans. It's also a lesson to Africans to learn and search more about their History, to stop looking for personal interests and start building real Nations from main street people to the top. Stop being Puppets.",1320364800,,568,4.69
8249674,5,B0013B34XU,"This is an impressive and surprisingly balanced first-hand account of what really happened in Angola.  The production team interviewed South Africans, Cubans, and Angolans to compile a visceral account of how Angola came to be a cold-war battleground between the US, the Soviet Union, Cuba, and South Africa.  The film starts with a stunning and revealing question:  Why did Nelsen Mandela choose to visit Cuba and embrace Fidel Castro for his first international trip?  The rest of the film answers this question by covering Cuba's involvement in Congo and Angola.  In the end, the Cubans swung the deal by agreeing to leave Angola if the South Africans would leave Namibia and release Mandela.  The film also covers the reasoning behind the US funding for UNITA and Cuba's extensive support to the eventual victors (MPLA).  It is also a disturbing tale of how US paranoia helped produce an African arms race that need never have taken place, all in an effort to contain a Soviet threat that never existed.

Perhaps the most interesting characters are Castro and his lieutenants.  It's easy to lose site of Cuba's totalitarian, oppressive regime in all the full-throated, enthusiasm to bring freedom to Africa.  One highly interesting point is a portion of the film that describes the advice of Russian advisors who insisted the MPLA aggressively assault enemy positions only to be pasted time and time again.  It was only after Castro himself began directing the war effort (over the phone!) that MPLA/Cuban combined forces were able to crush UNITA forces.  There is also an entertaining aside about Jorge Bisquet (and a personal interview with him) about his constant cigar smoking during the negotiations.  The production team did not ignore the American side and included remarkably frank interviews of Crocker.  Perhaps the most disturbing portion of the film is Larry Devlin's personal account (CIA Congo station chief at the time) of recieving poison toothpaste from the US with which to murder Congo's first President, Lumumba (which he chose not to use).",1269820800,7,2064,5.122388059701493
8249675,2,B0013B34XU,"Sadly this documentary, like many others dealing with Castro and the USSR, has its good doze of romanticized stupidity, all signature of the typical leftist elements who since the 1950s have adopted the subject of Castro and the USSR to incessantly sugar-coated and idolized them out of mere daringness, shamelessness, and stupidity (idolized from far, of course). Although this documentary indeed covers a lot of facts, it fails to truly expose the realities of Castro's slavish nature, his lies, and his unpardonable betrayal and destruction of the Cuban republic. In other words, it fails to expose Castro's real motives and rather clings more on Castro's out dated communist rhetoric and fraudulent propaganda than on the man's reality. In doing this, it distorts, and it sustains the absurdity of portraying Castro's involvement and interest in Africa as separate from that of the USSR and most absurd of all, as ""anti-imperialistic"".

First of all, anyone who truly knows of such matters knows that if there is a needed element for the survival of communism, it is expansion, and that when it came to imperialistic efforts no one was more desperate and dedicated than the Soviets and communists in general. Why? Because unadulterated communism is a system that deliberately destroys the national economy to center itself, despite its mediocrity, as the only power, voice, national entity, and provider. This extreme level of control, I may add, is achieved by employing a totalitarian sect like level of 24/7 bombardment of lies, dictation, isolation, repression, aggression, and intimidation. Such forms of government know, and knew, that they could not outperform the productivity and wealth of the capitalistic word and thus needed to implant satellite states to gain and secure resources without the need of a real economy, simple as that, and that IS much more than imperialism in itself. Go ask Chinese communist officials why they later allowed a capitalist economy under a communist regime at the sight of seeing the Soviet Union collapse.

Castro, a self-centered man who has ruined and enslaved his own nation for more than half a century under a purely economically retarded and patriotically offensive Stalinist manner, was not in Africa to liberate anyone but rather attempting to expand communism on the side of the USSR who in turn was financing, arming, and granting Castro the glory so that Cuban soldiers, not Soviet, shed the blood on a war that was ultimately a Soviet orchestration. At the end, Castro was comfortably doing in Africa what he had always dreamed of doing in Latin America but was never able to do in such an open manner. His distant attempts in Bolivia, Colombia, Central America, and Grenada all failed. The closest he ever got in America to such a direct communist colonizing act was in Chile, and at the wake of such a national fatality the Chilean military didn't take long to take over and not leave a single communist standing (today Chile has one of the highest standards of living in Latin America, and Cuba who once had the largest middle class per-capita of all Latin America, is today a crumbling ruin). As a result, for such an ego-maniac like Castro this African odyssey meant a lot (including a box full of diamonds according to an exiled body guard), and for the benefit and future of Cuba and Cubans, like everything Castro has done, it meant absolutely nothing.

To truly understand a big part of Cuba's reality and the why of its unfortunate destiny I strongly recommend the book ""Fidel, Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant"" by Cuban author Humberto Fontova. The man eats, drinks, and dreams Cuba and could not have put it in a more real way. This documentary on the other hand, must be seen with a previous knowledge to detect the garbage and connect the real dots as they come; otherwise, you will just be seeing another edited and watered down romantic take on a cold, destructive, power-hungry, and opportunistic psychopath that truly has no romanticism whatsoever.",1262736000,3,4021,5.0254872563718145
8249676,4,B0013B34XU,"This documentary is instrumental in understanding some of the unknown influences Castro, Guevara and the Cuban Revolution had on the world especially on the Nationalists and Leftists in the developing world.
It also illustrates the nature of the Soviet-Cuban relationship and how Castro utilized the massive amounts of Soviet military and logistical aid he received during the Cold War.
Whether you respect or despise Castro there is no doubt that he has made an indelible mark on history.",1250726400,4,489,5.282051282051282

8249678,2,B0013B34XU,"This is an intresting documentary. It was written by people with obvious biases and ideological blind-spots, but in spite of that it often stays close to the truth even if the truth is not directly stated. Its of most use to those already very familiar with the subject matter and history.

The first part of the documentary covers Cuba's involvement in the Congo around the time of the latters independence. The film makes mistakes by omission with regard to Lumumba and his rule. It almost brings itself to say the truth that Lumumba was a bad leader but in the end, it can't do that. The facts of the army mutiny are not presented and there is too much Belgian conspiracy nonsense.

The next part is better. It covers Cuba's attempts to undermine African governments including Congo and the quite frankly bizzare misadventures of Che in Africa. Everyone freely admits to their strategy in Africa of using Congo as a base to destablize the surrounding countries. They also (between the lines) make it clear what a joke their African allies in places like Congo were. Rather than revolutionaries, Cuba's proxies in Congo were basically warlords happy to run tiny feudal empires in the Bush with outside money, supplies and arms proping the whole thing up. And the sad unsaid truth in the end is that all Cuban money bought in the Congo was Chaos.

The second part of the documentary covers the wars in the Portugese African colonies. Its faults are that it overstates Cuba's role in events before 1974 and is sloppy with chronologies. Its at its best covering events in Angola. One of its greatest omissions was in not explaining the role of the Portugese in creating the free-for-all in Angola. The portugese army officers who overthrew the dictatorship are presented as socialist men of marble. Their irresonsible actions in terms of what happened in Angola are an off-limits subject.

The film is very good covering the three-way war for Angola. It has very good interviews with the American, Cuban and South African major players in events. What its not so good at is covering the Angolan side of things. For example, UNITA is badly covered and made into puppets while the MPLA is made into heroes. The absurdist situation of the MPLA being funded by western oil companies who were guarded by Cuban conscripts is an off-limits subject. In all truth, the MPLA were a bunch of leaches who were more interested in extracting wealth from Angola than in revolutions or socialism.

The film gives the Cubans what they want in that it presents the war in angola as being a conflict between South Africa and Cuba. It rarely questions the Cuban viewpoint. Worse yet, it tries to present Cuba as somehow being responsible for later events in South Africa. It glosses over the collapse of the Soviet Union and how that (and lack of money) changed things in Africa.

It also allows the Cuban commanders who failed in their wars in Southern Africa to blame the Soviets. While Cubans are supposedly responsible all on their own for deploying their army to Africa, they are at the same time presented as helpless and following a military strategy dictated from Moscow. We are supposed to believe that Cuba on its own could decide to send a signficant field army to Africa, but was not allowed to tactically control its own army in Africa.

The documentary ends by trying to give the Cubans credit for everything good that happened in Africa since 1957. But thats more than a little dishonest. The biggest blind spot of the documentary is that it never asks questions about what kinds of regimes Cuba was supporting. Angola was run by a gang whose main interest was in expoiting the country's oil wealth. Ethopia (mentioned in a minor way) was a government good only at killing its own people.

For all its flaws, the film can be interesting for those who know the history already. Though the overall presentation is bad, many of the interviews are very interesting. But in the end, Che Guevara ends up looking like a total fool. And Castro ends up looking like the prototypical fascist adventurer in the mold of Mussolini rather than any kind of liberator. Its to the credit of those who made the film that however warped their views are, the truth ended up coming through in the film despite their efforts.",1244764800,4,4297,4.758389261744966
8249679,5,B0013B34XU,"Cuba: An African Odyssey is a brilliantly-executed documentary on Cuban involvement in Africa from the 1960s to the 1980s. It's a two-dvd package, the first dealing mainly with Congo in the early 60s, the second with Cuba's intervention in Angola in the 70s and 80s. The director Jihan El-Tahri includes interviews with many of the power-players involved, from Fidel Castro to Pik Botha. It includes fabulous archive footage, in particular of Congo at the time of Lumumba's assassination. Then CIA station chief Larry Devlin puts his version on the record. It documents Che Guevara's intervention in the Eastern Congo, which, strangely, is sometimes hilarious. The Cubans age well. Some of them look like they could do it all again, almost fifty years later. It's the best high-profile documentary I've seen, and that's unqualified. It gives the viewer a crash-course in the sequence of cynicism that resulted in the manmade tragedy of Sub-Saharan Africa today. Watching old men trying to make their peace before they meet their maker can be far more revealing than the subject of the interview realises. Absolutely excellent, I'm buying it for Christmas for all my friends.",1228953600,13,1174,5.184210526315789
