5853517,1,B00DSAUN9M,"This piece is not a zombie film by any standard. For unknown reason males are turning ""toxic"", leading them into becoming ravenous beasts hungry for female flesh. By that it means the ""zombies"" seek out women to clear the urge and only die by ""headshots"". Bloody eyes and mouths represent the infected. How anyone could watch this and like it is beyond this reviewer. The story follows the four women on the cover and how they managed to escape to a Shinto shrine on the outskirts of a city. Japan is later revealed to be the origin of the plague so North Korea sends a nuclear missile and the city in the film gets destroyed. Momoko (the one in the maid outfit) ends up giving birth to a shining white babe that compels the remaining ""zombies""  to follow her away from the shrine and back to the destroyed city. The only good thing was that this was rented on Amazon digital and not a dvd purchase. Still, not worth $4. Maybe 99 cents. Really- go see Onechanbara or its sequel for a Japanese zombie film. The run time is one hour, fifteen minutes. Be warned that many fake rape scenes occur and are in poor taste.",1398643200,4,1114,4.407766990291262

5853519,3,B00DSAUN9M,"'[Lust of the Dead AKA 'Rape Zombie'] I'm not sure how this flick spawned two sequels, as it pretty much fails to deliver on most fronts. This said by someone whose tolerance for the ridiculous when it comes to Asian exploitation is noteworthy,

There's no sense in over-intellectualizing here; the only reasons we watch these films are to see zombies and propitious nudity, and not necessarily in that order. Oh yeah, and the accompanying carnage and mayhem that ensues. But ""what we have here is a failure to communicate"" either effectively, so the entire outing gets derailed, even before the train leaves the station.

The tale revolves around a global plague that makes the afflicted males become zombies with a single-minded lust for rape, and the only way to kill them is a head-shot, only it's the little, lower head that's the target. It's always been said that most men think with their little head, and nowhere is this fact more evident. The rest of the  story centers around a group of females and a non-afflicted, non-sexual male holed up in a building fighting for their lives and safety of their genitals.

As we've come to learn from past excursions into Asian zombie territory, the not-so-special-effects and meandering movements of said zombies are done more for laughs than for fright or shock - no exception in this instance. But this is court-excused and matters precious little when weighed against the heaving bosoms, cleavage, wardrobe-mishaps, exposed cheeks and gratuitious nudity that we expect when signing on for the ride, right? As luck would have it, wrong in this case as well. There's too much down-time awaiting the next flash of flesh, the much-heralded zombie grope, the forever-fetid fondling of female forms done, as always, against their wishes. Only the Japanese could get away with this; it's a part of their culture, apparently...

So, without a budget, effects, significant gore or rewarding nudity, what's left? A plot written on a post-it and a few silly scenarios, a couple of breasts and a gaggle of lackluster zombie wannabees. Not much to get worked up over once, let alone sign on for two more sequels. Not to me at least. Could be I'm jaded, as my degeneracy is legendary, but I'm here to warn most of you that the dvd cover is about the high point of the film. Unless you're high, of course. Which I guess might be redemptive in this case...",1389484800,45,2393,4.841075794621027

8597135,3,B00DSAUN9M,"Not as well made as I was hoping for, especially from a three part series. I was hoping more for a better resolution camera, directing and production value, like those from Vivid Entertainment. Not so. But in contrast the special effects and music were on par. So, for a B-film it fit right in.",1470096000,,294,4.462962962962963

8597139,4,B00DSAUN9M,"These 3 movies are pretty much a soft-porn parody of Japanese culture, they are making social commentary on things like Otaku, the fact that Japanese seem to be having less sex than before, the apparent preoccupation of the Japanese male with rape culture, the Momoko phenomenon (which is part of Otaku), and even makes fun of Japanese porn itself. These are very low budget films but that is part of their appeal. They really are fun if you watch a lot of Japanese movies and are familiar with some aspects of Japanese culture. If not you might enjoy them anyway, but, perhaps not as much. This first movie can stand alone, the next 2 are tied together and you have to watch all e to make any sense of the last 2.",1445558400,7,714,4.416666666666667
