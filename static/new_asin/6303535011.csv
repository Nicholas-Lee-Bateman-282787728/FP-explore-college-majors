I prefer Joan Bennett as a brunette and this was a year before 'Trade Winds' (1939) made her into the classic (dyed) brunette that truly solidified her image. Robert Cummings is barely in this film (one scene in the first HOUR of the film), it is really a Randolph Scott film, although when he is on screen, Cummings is enjoyable, it is just that you really want more out of him! Randolph Scott is an actor I really wish I could like, he was a huge Western star, but he always comes off as wooden to me and I have seen him in so many films that I really don't know how to change my low opinion of him, even when he is funny as in 'Roberta' (1935) he is boring to me. I think that unlike 'Texas Rangers Ride Again' this film is going to have an additional ""Used-Like New"" listing in a few days.",1392768000,,828,4.085889570552148
