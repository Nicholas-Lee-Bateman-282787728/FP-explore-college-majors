1900402,5,B00009YXBW,"When I was researching Dora, I found so few reviewers with little boys that I almost didn't buy this DVD.  I'm glad I did!  My 18 month old little boy is all boy, and he loves Dora.  So does my nephew.  Yes, Dora is a girl; but the videos are not ""girly"".  They are fun and engaging.  I love that Dora uses Spanish frequently througout each episode.  The episodes are fun and entertaining, but educational at the same time.

Try out Dora and I'm sure you'll be happy that you did.",1118707200,15,480,4.197802197802198
1900403,5,B00009YXBW,"I got this for my daughter when she turned two, in a few months she was reciting the rhymes in the car. Dora is pretty amazing for kids, and for some crazy reason they love her! This is a great video that she never gets bored of watching. You learn rhymes and a little spanish at the same time!!",1095897600,11,295,4.016949152542373
1900404,5,B00009YXBW,"My 2 year old daughter is a huge Dora fan, and she loves this DVD.  The 4 episodes are very good, and include Dora had a little lamb, which is very entertaining, and deals with many of the nursery rhymes our kids see at preschool and look at in books.
The menu selection on the DVD is easy, though I wish there was a way to have the episodes repeat or go back to back with one another- when my Mom babysits, she has trouble turning the DVD on, so easier is always better.
The DVD also contains some interesting features, like games which I think will be good for my daughter when she gets a little older.",1069804800,17,604,4.11864406779661
1900405,5,B00009YXBW,"This is yet another entertaining Dora video as Dora and Boots try to solve the silliest riddle.  If you have a child who wants to ""Watch Dora"" all the time, even when the tv show is not on, get the DVDs...there are 4 episodes on one DVD.  The Rhymes episode is really cute, although the original versions of some Mother Goose rhymes are altered slightly.",1062806400,14,354,4.430769230769231
1900406,2,B00009YXBW,"It skips, even after I cleaned it (it was really dirty) it still skips when I play it. Too bad because it was a gift!",1374624000,,117,3.72

1900408,5,B00009YXBW,"I just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and it is her newest favorite DVD. She just loves Humpty Dumpty and Mary Had a little lamb with Dora. If there is any hesitation, trust me and just buy it.",1360454400,,205,3.9047619047619047
1900409,5,B00009YXBW,"My three year old daughter loves this. Thankfully, she has learned to use the DVD remote controller and can hit the re-play button by herself now!  This is educational and fun. I don't feel guilty letting her watch this, because she is learning. The cutest thing is hearing her sing a long with the songs. Even my five year old still likes watching it and comments, ""Oh, I know that from my book"".",1358380800,,397,4.438356164383562
1900410,4,B00009YXBW,"My daughter is happy with her new Dora DVD on Rhymes and Riddles.  This one does not keep her attention like some of the others, but she will watch it by default any day.  No fault to the seller, because the DVD was delivered in perfect condition.  Thank you for another happy buy amazon!",1351296000,,288,4.296296296296297
1900411,2,B00009YXBW,"My daughter is much like the granddaughter of the other person who commented on here about her being afraid of Humpty Dumpty. My 20 month old daughter usually LOVES Dora and drives me crazy begging to watch it every morning. She only gets 20ish minutes of TV a day, and Dora is the only thing she ever wants to watch. She learns a lot from it, so I don't mind her watching it at all... until the Little Lamb/Nursery Rhyme episode. She watched the part where Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, and she FREAKED when she saw him in pieces. She ran to the closest person to her (her Meme) and was crying, shaking from head to toe, pointing toward the TV, and hiding her face. I've never seen this typically happy child so absolutely terrified! It's been 24 hours, and she hasn't said a word about wanting to watch Dora again (very ususual for her). I hope this episode hasn't ruined the whole show for her. Hopefully it'll be better once she's older.

Other than that, there's nothing wrong with Dora. I just want to make sure that if your child is sensitive to something getting hurt you might want to watch his/her reaction to the episode with Humpty Dumpty.",1303171200,2,1154,4.443396226415095
1900412,1,B00009YXBW,My son loves Dora and has probably watched every Dora episode several times.  I like it too because I think my son has learned a lot from watching Dora.  The reason I gave this just one star is because this particular DVD is a big let down compared to other Dora episodes.  I was hoping my son would learn some rhymes from this one.  I was shocked to see that there was not even one complete rhyme in this DVD.  It keeps from jumping from one rhyme to another without ever finishing it.  There are other better Dora DVDs and please get those - but save your money and don't buy this particular one.,1297900800,6,598,4.201754385964913
1900413,5,B00009YXBW,The vhs was way beyond what i expected it to be. I will recommened Amazon to everyone. I had looked other places & nothing compared to your prices & quality.,1280275200,,157,4.266666666666667
1900414,4,B00009YXBW,I bought the DVD for my 2-year old grandchild.  She loved it as she does everything Dora!!,1278374400,,90,4.294117647058823
1900415,5,B00009YXBW,My granddaughter loves watching TV on a cold and rainy day. And this looked like a good one to add to her collection. She loves it. It was a good buy.,1274832000,,150,3.870967741935484
1900416,2,B00009YXBW,"My 22-month-old granddaughter loves Dora, and she loves most of this video. The Humpty Dumpty scene either scares her or makes her really sad. After the scene where he falls, they show him in pieces with his four parts scattered all over the screen. She didn't react the first time she watched it. The second and third times she saw it, she started sobbing as it built up to the scene where he falls from the wall.  I won't let her watch it again until she's a little older. I can't give anything that makes her cry like that a good rating.  This is a baby who doesn't cry very often, and it was heartbreaking to watch her reaction.",1255910400,7,632,4.302521008403361
1900417,4,B00009YXBW,"Most Dora DVDs are loved by little kids in the pre-K to K age range.  I bought this along with a couple other Dora DVDs because of this reason.  It's good for the kids to watch some of these episodes over several times, they remember more words and start building their vocabulary early on.",1247961600,,290,4.351851851851852
1900418,5,B00009YXBW,"We have had this DVD for 4 years.  All 3 of my children enjoy it, including my 2 year-old son.  As a reading teacher I appreciate the educational value of exposing children to rhymes.  I love that my children are learning spanish words and that the riddles also make them think (at least the first couple of times watching it).  This DVD is an all around winner!",1226102400,,362,4.358208955223881

1900420,4,B00009YXBW,"I enjoyed all the episodes. The first one was very entertaining, my daughter sang along to all of the rhymes, as Dora helped the lamb find Mary. Mr. Riddles was also entertaining and funny. I personally purchased this DVD for the Big River episode because my 2 year old and I like the song boots sings about how much he loves his boots.",1189728000,,336,4.349206349206349
