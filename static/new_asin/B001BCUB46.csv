3488740,5,B001BCUB46,"Ghosts and demons of all shapes and forms come alive in this real-life series of those humans unfortunate enough to cross their path!

Unlike Hollywood movies and common junk like ""Ghost Hunters"" which are  time-wasting ""entertainment"", this ""A Haunting"" series is a solutions-provider. Every case is unique in themselves and is something we can all learn from and know what to avoid. You will also be able to see how each of these haunting cases are solved, although not all of them are successfully solved or banished. Many affilicted victims end up fleeing the scene of contact, and most cases end with banishing or cleansing rituals of some sort. I hope to see a more powerful DVD series that solves these things permanently. To go indepth into solving such cases would take greater time and follow-ups with each case. With over 3 dozen cases to learn from, you will no doubt be chilled with each case.

Don't become the next unfortunate victim the next time you are tempted by the Dark Side!

If you find reading books on this subject matter too tedious for whatever reason, get these DVDs!

To the producers of these series, kudos to you guys!
Please produce more of these case studies and provide solutions for each case.",1239840000,7,1228,4.773584905660377
3488741,5,B001BCUB46,"This collection of four seasons of the Discovery Channel show is a great addition for people looking for some ""true horror"" or just for a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon. The stories portrayed in ""A Haunting"" are based upon the eyewitness descriptions of the people involved. One does not actually have to believe in ghosts or the supernatural to enjoy them. One need only realize that the people featured do and they believe their lives changed by such encounters. The series is excellently put together and dramatically staged with good acting (most of the time anyway).",1239408000,7,575,4.877551020408164
3488742,5,B001BCUB46,"I've been a huge fan of this series since it started it's first season. I'm surprised it got canceled by the Discovery Channel. This has some of the scariest accounts of the supernatural with no hocus pocus, blood and gore, or gratuitous nudity. I have been downright scared to the bone with some of these tales, granted some of these might be a wee bit over exaggerated. I recommend any person who is buying the DVDs to buy the entire series, it is much cheaper to buy the 9 videos than buying them piece by piece.",1238371200,9,515,4.375
3488743,5,B001BCUB46,The Haunting series is an interesting take on hauntings by ghosts trapped between life and where they need to go.  The families that they affect are surprised by what they encounter.  Do they survive their encounters?  How are they affected?  You just gotta watch the shows to find out!,1237161600,7,286,4.775510204081633
3488744,5,B001BCUB46,Great collection if you are into ghost stories.  This collection does include the narration which was not included (an error) if you purchased one of the first releases of season 1 and 2.,1234569600,12,187,4.666666666666667

3488746,5,B001BCUB46,"This product was shipped very quickly. I bought these movies for my son. He and his friends are very ""into"" this sort of thing. They have watched the series on T.V. and plan to watch them at sleep overs.",1231286400,2,203,4.230769230769231
3488747,5,B001BCUB46,"I was a fan of A Haunting when it ran on the Discovery channel and I was very sad to see them cancel this show. A Haunting was produced by New Dominion Pictures, who did the FBI Files and the New Detectives series that also ran on Discovery. For those who are not familiar with the show, A Haunting covers real life experiences of encounters with the paranormal. Interviews with people who experienced the paranormal activity are included. Some appear in shadow and the show is augmented by reenactments of their stories. What sets this show apart from others is the high quality production values and interview with both the individuals and the paranormal investigators who assisted them and shed light into their craft. The various methods of scientific study and differing types of hauntings, demons, phantoms and etc. are fascinating. This show is scary, (scarier than many horror movies, it was so well produced) there is no gore, but the atmosphere is extremely creepy. If you watch some of these episodes late at night, they can give people bad dreams, as seveal of my coworkers will attest. It is so well done, that the actors simply blend into the roles. There are four seasons in this set. I will share some of my favorites.

Season 1
Hell House - A demon story featuring the renowned Ed and Lorraine Warren. One of the scariest shows of the entire series.

Season 2
Gateway to Hell - A haunted nightclub built on the site of an old slaughterhouse by the Licking River which flows true north. Another one of the scariest of the series.

Hungry Ghosts - A house in Taiwan that was built to curse its inhabitants. Another series scariest.

Where Demons Dwell - A young boy is tormented by a deomonic presence and Ed and Lorraine Warren are called in. Very creepy!

Ghost Solider - A haunted photograph complicates a lonley woman's life when she finds not one but two spirits.

Season 3
Fear House - A house that sends many of its occupants fleeing. One former resident attempts to help another family before its too late.

The Unleashed - A man plays with witchcraft and suffers the consequences. Very scary.

Wheatsheaf Horror - A a spirit haunting a pub in Britain attacks those within and a psychic faces her own fears.

The Possessed - A paranormal investigator becomes possessed herself and seeks help from legendary demonolgist John Zaffis. One of the the scariest of the entire series.

Season 4
The Apartment - The spirits of a drug dealer and his victim haunt a young couple and terrify a psychic.

Where Evil Lurks - A family discovers that their house is a portal to hell. When one demon is banished another takes its place. Another scary one.

Casa De Los Muertos - A famous musician with the gift of sense battles a deadly ghost. I won't give away the twist of this story. Another creepy tale.

Legend Trippers - Teens are fascinated by an eerie legend in an old cemetery. Sereral groups who experienced the haunting are profiled.

A Haunting is an excellent show that will make you think twice about how to perceive the world. It is also interesting to see how the people handled what they experienced. Some turned to their faith, others turned away and many who did not believe in the paranormal now do.",1230854400,129,3226,4.65669014084507

3488755,1,B001BCUB46,"This is a five star series.  One of the best on TV if you want to be scared to death.  However this set is vastly overpriced.  Right now Walmart has the complete Seasons 1 - 6 in one box set for only $20. And even better, all 9 discs are housed in a hard plastic case on their own ""page""; a real space saver as opposed to the bulky ""slim"" cases and the flimsy carboard box. As far as I know, Walmart is the only store carrying this set.  So, if you love this series but don't have the $30 - $90 to lay down for it, the ""Special Edition"" box set is the smarter and cheaper way go.

* In case anyone is wondering, the audio problems that plagued the original box set of Seasons 1 and 2 are not present here.  The discs presented here are the fixed disc meaning Anthony Call's creepy narration is included.",1414108800,2,803,4.050632911392405

3488757,4,B001BCUB46,"The first season or two of this series was awesome! Yes, the acting sucked at times and the production quality wasn't the greatest but it still was perfectly creepy. As the series went on the acting became worse and it was more than obvious they started shooting on the same set. The stories may have been just as creepy but between the acting and production quality it just wasn't the same as the first two seasons. Still a great set to have, if only to watch the first two creepy seasons and laugh at the other two.",1411689600,,517,4.34020618556701

3488765,5,B001BCUB46,"Love these uncut versions of the episodes of ""The Haunting.""  The uncut versions help to put many of the stories into perspective.  The picture quality is excellent.  These DVDs are all narrated just like on TV.  The only thing I wish they would have done was edit out the 1-2 second previews.  On TV, after commercials, you see the a 1-2 second preview before the show resumes.  They didn't edit out the previews on the DVD, but it doesn't take away from the show.  I just thought I would throw in this tidbit for your information.

If you're on the fence about ordering this collection, don't be.  I think you will be truly happy with your purchase.  I hope Destination America continues creating more episodes.",1406419200,,713,4.632
3488766,5,B001BCUB46,"It was all my old favorites with those irritating commercial interruptions.  It didn't include ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" or ""A Haunting in Georgia"" and that was ok because I already have those on DVDs.  The box was a little torn but that was explained on the description before I bought it.  The DVDs were in great shape.",1402963200,,323,4.631578947368421

3488768,5,B001BCUB46,"I saw a few of these stories on Discovery Channel and I am not disappointed in them at all. I love them, so very well made and I was curled up on the bed watching these stories and would lose track of time.
I recommend these dvd's and I intend to watck them all over again. I have ordered the series 5 and can hardly wait for them to arrive. Very well done and PLEASE can you make some more of these again!!",1397433600,,407,3.9156626506024095

3488771,5,B001BCUB46,"Excellent show, a great thrill. The stories are so chilling and for the most part the dramatizations are pretty good.

3488772,5,B001BCUB46,I love shows about the paranormal and this show does a great job of reenacting people's experiences with it.  Very well made and the actors they use are very good.  It is not cheesy at all.  I am really glad they decided to bring this show back because I had missed watching high quality shows about the paranormal.,1395964800,,315,4.396551724137931
3488773,5,B001BCUB46,"I loved it on TV and now I love it on DVD. Its always nice to be able to watch all my favorite episodes back to back. This show is creepy and not for the faint at heart, but is a must have for ghost lovers like me.",1395705600,,214,3.4791666666666665
3488774,5,B001BCUB46,I watched A Haunting when it was on the Discovery Channel .I wanted to see these shows again and when I found out I could purchase them on Amazon I did. Now my family and I have already watched them about 5 times a disk in the past 4 years.,1394064000,,240,3.82
3488775,5,B001BCUB46,"This is  documentary style that has interviews with the people who have lived through true paranormal experiences and not just a few knocks on the wall or things falling over by themselves.
These people are being chocked, slapped, tormented and have things thrown at them, including getting thrown around themselves. The stories are re enacted with other actors but the interviews are with the real people who went through the ordeals. Some are blacked out for privacy reasons.

This is one of the most chilling box sets iv seen I think ever, it genuinely creeped me out. Some episodes are not too bad but some actually had me afraid to go into the bathroom on my own. I'm usually hard core when it comes to this type of thing, iv always been into ghost documentaries. I always enjoy to follow all things paranormal, but it never before now forced me to keep the lights on at night. This one did without breaking a sweat and I think its because I believed everything that happened.

There are parts of each episode where all the sound and music stops and you are just waiting for the inevitable to happen even thought you have no idea what is happening, I'm never one to end up watching horrors behind my fingers but this really freaked me out. Many of them have small children taking hard hits too and it is very hard to watch.

This is not  Hollywood muck with cheap jump scares that will make you laugh after its over, its about real people who are face to face with energies that are pure evil. Most people get financially stuck in these properties  (that seem too good to be true) and have no choice but to remain stuck in their situation. Its very surprising to see some of the bizarre things that happen, they are very diverse but all very effective to both the people who are living it and the viewers. you really couldn't make this stuff up.

If you are picky you might nit pick at the fact that most of the sets look the same, I'm sure they used the same basement each time but I never cared, that basement is scary. Some of the actors are used more then once, which also never bothered me.

The make up is fairly ok and makes the demons and ghosts look real enough to get the message across and chills up and down your spine. Honestly though I was way more scared when I couldn't see anything, you just hear something like a growl and you don't know what it is. its extremely effective. some of the scenes you just don't know what is going to happen its so freaky.

My hat goes off to the young actors they did really well. I felt so much empathy for these families, some of them are harassed on a relentless level with little or no help. This series also introduced me to the warrens who are just so amazing and are loaded with experience in this area. These hero's help many people in this series and outside it too.

if you have a few bob I would recommend checking out their book - Ed and Lorraine Warrens ""Demonologist"" its pure freaky, even during a nice sunny day. Again this is no Hollywood muck its very real and it will frighten the pants off you. Sadly we have lost Ed but Lorraine is still on her feet doing her thing, being awesome.

I watch these episodes wondering what the hell I would have done if I found myself in ANY of these situations. It is hard not to put yourself in each their shoes and trying to figure out what you would do to cope. would I have the mental strength to put up a wall and protect my sanity? This makes this series very addictive so be warned - you will want to watch All of the episodes. it is a real - what would you do? type documentary.

Highly recommended to all paranormal fans or anyone even slightly interested in it. its a real eye opener and will put teenagers off poking around dangerous areas or messing around with a Ouija board or spell books thinking that its no big deal. Its never worth the risk and they should respect energies that they have no control over. These things are so easy to let in and extremely hard to get rid off.

Personal favourite episode is ""the possessed"" I would say this episode scared me more then any other in the series. The actor who played Mary is just amazing and really got me in this one.  From start to finish this episode had the hairs on my neck standing up. You just want someone to step in and make it stop and they have some showdown at the end.

Stop reading this review and add this item into your basket its fantastic value.... and really freaky.",1393977600,,4457,4.327338129496403

3488795,5,B001BCUB46,"I watched A Haunting religiously when it was on cable. I picked this four season collection up at Sam's Club a while back when they had it and only recently began to watch the show again. This show is just as entertaining as it was the first time. Now I suppose you have to admit that the stories are quite the dramatization. I'd say it's rather rare to see ghosts, demons, poltergeists, to see objects moving, doors opening or slamming, etc. I also don't think that exorcisms are as common as they seem to be in the show. I was hoping to see actual paranormal investigators dismissing the stories as dramatic rubbish but there don't seem to be any such entries for this series. As usual a show like this really only has FANS who have once again praised a show. So I'll just have to be one of those fans who is very happy with his purchase who has been very entertained. These stories are good and scary, and actually quite dark at times. I wish there were more shows like A Haunting.",1361923200,,984,4.353260869565218

3488799,4,B001BCUB46,"I use to watch this show when it was on Discovery Channel! When I saw it was released on DVD... even better! I enjoyed this show during the afternoon and now that I can watch it anytime... just makes it that much more enjoyable! I always say that it is becoming more and more of a challenge to find a good, scary movie/show that isn't gory and that provides you with a good, thought provoking scare with a hint of the creep factor! I feel this show provides all of that! Offering real tales of people who have been through real life hauntings! Some of these hauntings are of friendly ghosts co-existing with the families and then there are the ghost stories of those families tormented by evil demons and poltergeists! With just the right amount of creepiness without the gore, this show is perfect for anyone who loves a good ghost story! I love watching this series on Halloween night! Truly just... a great haunting ghost story! The ONLY reason I did not give this full stars was because of the acting in the scenes. The stories are great! However... sometimes the acting... is less than pristine. However... overall... it's been a real challenge to find a series as decent as this one has been!",1358640000,,1198,4.550925925925926

3488801,5,B001BCUB46,"I really like these stories. I think this show is the best of it's kind. I don't believe this show will disappoint -at ALL! Real Scary.

I guess people already know what they're getting, before ordering something like this. It is a TV show...

Best Episodes, in my opinion:
""The Possessed""
""The Unleashed""
""Legend Trippers""
&
""A Haunting in Connecticut""
-However, this episode is over 1 hour, it's better than the recent movie, & is not in this collection. I bought it separately, and i Love that one too!

I am very happy with my purchase",1355270400,,539,4.59375
3488802,5,B001BCUB46,"In most cases, this series does a fairly good job with the time programs are allotted in relating eyewitness events and paranormal phenomenon. I have followed up on a select few of them through related paranormal web sites and property records finding them not only credible, but interesting in extending as well as collaborating evidence. In some cases, valuable properties have been sold for as low as 8 percent or even lower of their normal appraised value as some owners have completely abandoned them. ""Where Evil Lurks"" is just one example. Other cases such as ""Fear House"", the Union Screaming House and ""Sallie's House"" are among the most compelling. All in all, this set is an important piece of paranormal history.",1354492800,,724,4.991735537190083

The new episodes started the first friday in oct. and they are just as great as the previous seasons if not greater. I rate them on a level with paranormal witness. Check them out if you have access to the cable channel. The series is on friday nights at 10pm or you can catch them on daytime sometimes during the week if you missed them on friday evenings.

I just watched the episode Hungry Ghost. It 's about a family.moving into a mansion in Taiwan. Turns out it's visited by some nasty ghost. A Taoist priest comes & tells the family there that there are 2 powerful spirits there. He also tells them no chinese desiger would build a house like it. He then tells them whoever built it designed it to KILL them. He does an appeasment ceremony. Things calm down a little. But the family moves out on the priests advice. This is just one of the episodes in this fantastic series.,1343865600,,693,4.37984496124031

I am thrilled to be able to buy it at this price becuase if you bought it through Discovery Channel, you would pay alot more for just one or two episodes.  Here you get 39 and I would also recommend getting ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" and ""A Haunting in Georgia"" 2 DVD set narrated by Tony Call.  They were the first episodes put out by the Discovery Channel.  I never believed in the paranormal until I saw these shows, but they made a believer out of me.  You begin to realize that there really is a life after death and that there is such a thing as evil spirits.  If there are evil spirits, then there must also be good spirits. When you realize these things and that the world of the dead can interact with ours, it is a moment of revelation.  These are the spookiest, strangest happenings I have ever seen and I could watch each episode over and over and never get bored.

3488808,5,B001BCUB46,"I saw the DVD collection for sale and being a fan of The Paranormal I decided to invest and was glad I did. I like the way the stories are told through a narrator who tells the story as a whole while you are viewing either the actual witnesses or the actors who are playing them. This is done very proffesional and you are instantly hooked on the Haunting and Characters. This reminds me a lot of Unsolved Mysteries because it has the addition of the narrator. It is better quality than Ghost Hunters or even Paranormal State, it is not an investigation as those shows are but a Paranormal Story, and of course then the Investigators get called in but it is told as a story, it is especially enjoyable to see Lorraine Warren. The major difference between This Show and GH or PS is that A Haunting is viewed as a story rather thtan watching people asking questions in the dark. If you do buy this series, each episode is not broken down into chapters on the DVD so if you were to try to skip forward or back to where you think the next segment is, you will be either at the end or beggining.",1331596800,,1090,4.2451923076923075

This show is great for people of all ages. It doesn't contain swearing, gore, nudity or anything that the Freddy or Jason movies have. There is no killing but it is very very creepy even more so than any of the big time horror movies. If you have never seen this show it's on the Discovery Channel from 9AM to 12PM. Check it out.

To this day, certain episodes still give me goosebumps and make me second guess how badly I need to use the restroom in the middle of the night lol!

It's new brother show ""The Haunted"" on the Animal Planet is pretty much the same, but with a spin on including how hauntings how an affect on our pets.

and every one of these shows. The show contains real life witnesses who tell their story while re-enacting with decent actors at the same time. It

is amazing how some of these episodes are scarier than any horror movie out there because you know its real and the suspense is very intense,

especially if you watch it at night, or alone or a combination of the both. One of my favorite episodes is ""The Presence"", but I suggest you watch

them in order that way your not constantly shuffling through cd's like I did as I made the mistake of jumping around. This show also has a great

replay value as well, as I have seen several episodes multiple times and they are always just as intense.

3488825,5,B001BCUB46,"All four sesons, 39 episodes clocking in at over 45 minutes each, one great price!

The pros:
1] Most stories are scary at one point. There is very little gore, but with the excellent execution of tension and the impending doom atmosphere, it makes the 45 minutes seem like a feature length movie.

2] The ghost stories are the best stories.

3] The music and photography are top notch

4] Most of the acting is very believeable. Some of the actors appear in different episodes playing different characters

5] the interview segments with the actual people whom the story happened to.

The cons:
1] I wasn't too crazy about the demonic posession stories. There are too many movies and shows that basically tell the same story. Person messes with the occult. person becomes posessed by a demon. Person needs an exorcist.

2] When evidence is mentioned that was gathered in the REAL story, it is not used in the re-enactments. Instead, faked stuff is used there. Only in one story that I can remember, they showed an actual photo that the real person the story happened to take.

3] A few of the actors didn't act well or didn't fit the part they played.

4] This is presented a ""true"" stories. Although very well executed, and without showing much of the actual evidence that is mentioned by the interviewed people, one wonders how much was actually dramatized for TV. I also wondered, since some of the stories are pulled from memory, how much was actual occurance and how much was distorted by time?

5] Some of the acting is season four was really bad.

A few things I noticed:
1] a few actors appear in more than one episode. Sort of like the ""Not-ready-for-real-horro-players""
2]Some of the locations are reused in multiple stories. Most stories involving a basement use the same basement. Most stories having a long, second story hallway, use the same hallway, just repainted and re-curtained.

These are good stories, but I wish they would take out those annoying flashback sequences that followed the commercials when the episode was run on TV. It is distracting when you're watching it as a DVD. Otherwise, I have noticed a few mistakes, such as a baby's name was mixed up during an episode, and sometimes events happen, such as a pregnancy and then birth of a baby, or the narrator says ""months pass"" yet some kids don't seem to grow or age accordingly.

However, if you are looking for real evidence of paranormal activity you'll not find it here.  Nothing is presented outside of the re-enacted memories of the people supposedly involved.  Although the stories often describe physical evidence such as audio and video recordings, spirit photographs, and such, absolutely none is shown independent of the dramatized stories.  It makes little sense that these proofs would not have been maintained and available for this program.

In one particulat egregious example, the people determine that one of the spirits is s young girl buried in a basement.  They begin to dig and reach some kind of slate covering underneath the wooden floor.  They are tired and decide to continue the next day.  When they return to the house, contractors have already installed new flooring.  Yeah right!  I hate it when people come unannounced and univited to my house and perform repairs I didn't request!

1. After going through most of the series, I got really sick of the same neighborhood used by the film crew.  Come on -- mix it up a little.
2. You don't need to watch many of the episodes to realize there's a theme in place.  WTF --
Newly divorced parent + 13 year old girl going through puberty = haunted house.  Watch this show to know the true source of poltergeists!
3. A lot of the episodes reference photos and recordings taken of the ghosts.  If those exist, why doesn't the show actually show the original photos and let us hear the recordings?  That would be extra cool.  Why leave those out?  I know they actually show some photos now, but they don't seem to be the originals.",1267401600,,779,4.354166666666667

I would recommend and I have this show to anyone that has a interest in the super natural.,1266796800,,429,4.296296296296297

3488847,3,B001BCUB46,"My sister got this for my Dad for Christmas a few years ago for $10 at one of those Big Lots type places and because of the price I never borrowed it thinking it was low quality.  I borrowed it one Halloween and wasn't disappointed, it is close to Unsolved Mysteries but each episode is just short of 50 min.  It is in my Halloween rotation now.

The box and cases themselves are nothing special, it's a plain box with each disk in a slim case, but I sometimes think DVD seasons are a little too fancy and take up a little too much space.  This is a 9 DVD set and for the size it takes up on a shelf it's great.

A few things that this set didn't do well on:

Video quality.  It gets a little grainy at times, not as bad as some DVDs but you really notice it if you have a HDTV.

Chapter Markers.  One advantage about DVDs is the ability to skip intros so after the first one you don't have to see the opening for every episode.  Season 1, 2, and 3 had every episode as one chapter so if you hit skip then it went to the next episode.  Season 4 got it correct and when you hit skip once it went right into the story, skipping the intro.  I know some people don't care about this but when I watch TV I binge on it, watching a few DVDs or a few TV episodes on my Tivo device so skipping is important to me.

Overall I think the acting and locations were alright but I took off one star for quality and one star for chapter markers.  I would still recommend it even with these small flaws.

EDIT:  I want to add this is not the complete set, there are two movie length episodes that led to the production to these seasons.  They are 'A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT' and 'A HAUNTING IN GEORGIA'.  One of them was made into a major motion picture so make sure you get the 'documentary' ones instead.  They come as a double feature DVD on Amazon, only $9.99, I'm going to get that and see what it's like.  I can't say much for them as I haven't watched them but I'm going to get them before next Halloween and update this review.",1263859200,3,2018,4.035264483627204
3488848,5,B001BCUB46,very enjoyable to watch these ghostly stories as they happen to real everyday people. For those that enjoy being spooked this would be an excellent collection from which to draw all kinds of different ghost-like scenarios. Ive noticed that some people in my circle aren't interested in being spooked but there are millions out there like myself who enjoy the scary elements. You have 9 DVD's to watch with several stories on each disc so you should be freaked out for quite some time. Watching them alone in the dark with one candle burning may create the right ambiance.....we'll leave that up to you. Oh..and by the way..make sure your door is locked.....,1258588800,6,657,4.823008849557522
3488849,5,B001BCUB46,"What I noticed in A Haunting, is that in a Christian exorcism- Catholic or otherwise, you're supposed to call Archangel Michael (that's what they would have done in the middle ages) and in all the Christian blessings that don't work in A Haunting, they fail to call Archangel Michael. The theory behind this is everyone has what they specialize in-it's Archangel Michael's specialty to get rid of demons. It's the Father's (called Yahweh, Allah or Prime Creator in other faiths) specialty to create. Getting rid of demons isn't his specialty (that's why he created Archangel Michael for that purpose. If you prayed to him, he would send Archangel Michael anyway). It's Jesus' and Mother Mary's specialty to show non-judgmental, forgiving, unconditional Divine love to everyone good or bad (getting rid of demons isn't their specialty either, they might ask Archangel Michael to go to you). So in the Christian exorcisms or blessings that didn't work in the Haunting they didn't call the guy created for the job of getting rid of demons- Archangel Michael. Keep on mentally repeating ""Archangel Michael please make this place safe"" yourself, if you can't find a competent blessing person.

Also I'd burn sage every night before going to bed in the bedroom or the area the haunting is occurring in rather than just once in the whole house. I'd keep sage on my bedside table on a ceramic plate to light it up really fast if I see something.

If you have little children or pets in a haunted house, don't make them sleep alone.

If it's a deceased human soul, instead of yelling ""get out of here, leave us alone"" which doesn't work, you could say ""why don't you go towards the light and move on? It's fun on the other side. It's much nicer than here. Don't you have deceased relatives who can go visit? Don't you ever miss someone you loved who has passed on and wish you could visit them."" While trying to reason with them, tell them what would benefit them. Make up stuff, make it seem like the other side is so great, they have to go check it out by going through the light.  Just walk around talking out loudly how great it would be to go through the light (whether you can see them or not or whether you know if they're listening or not) & how they can have everything their heart desires on the other side. You could pray to whoever you pray to ""send angels, to escort these beings to the other side.""

I liked the Shamballa method used by the psychic in New Hampsire,

If it's a non- human entity -and it's a jinn, you'll have to go a mosque as Muslim Imams specialize in getting rid of jinns.

If the non- human entity is a reptilian, you could try calling Archangel Michael, but if that doesn't work, I would leave, as reptilians will try to get into your head and cause schizophrenia. Your health is more important than any property. Reptilians target and control the gullible, slightly psychic people who can telepathically hear them.",1255392000,2,2941,4.6226053639846745

3488854,5,B001BCUB46,"I live in Connecticut where many episodes featured locations and am familiar with The Warrens and John Z. I enjoy seeing the locations I'm familiar with. Though I am a skeptic, most of these episodes are unusually scary, with reasonably good acting- especially from the juvenile actors. It's not the typical scenery-chewing melodrama and it's accomplished without the usual blood and gore. (The Warrens are/were rather creepy if you've met them or seen them in person!) This series is right up there with Twilight Zone with scenes that will linger in your head long after you first saw them. I realize that much of the drama is controversial or even imagined and some unfortunate people might even be mentally ill- but the intent to present the episodes as believeable is masterful. The ""budget"" effects are rather clever (see what you can do without Industrial Light & Magic, ha!) and Tony Call's narration is not just a means to save dollars. The editing and directing is exceptional for this genre- so easy to fall back on hackneyed, cheesy elements. Too bad that this series is no longer in production- I like the fact that several of the stories take place in the past 10 years and not decades ago with ""contemporary"" ""ghosts""- like druggies and depressed teenagers!",1248220800,10,1271,4.888888888888889
3488855,5,B001BCUB46,"Whether you accept the events being portrayed in the series at face value or think they're the product of over-active imaginations, the result is the same: you'll thoroughly enjoy the show.  If you're skeptical of everything paranormal, then think of the show as something like Supernatural, only presented in a docu-drama format; you don't have to believe it to enjoy it.  The production values are superb; the acting and narration are excellent; and, best of all, the atmosphere is genuinely eerie. Even the comments by the actual people who experienced the events is woven into the story skillfully enough that they don't detract from the building suspense.  The only criticism I would make (and, believe me, it's a very mild criticism) is that the show has a certain peculiarity indiginous to Discovery/History Channel shows: the place in the show that would clearly have come after the ""commercial break"" sometimes recaps what was already shown.  But even that's handled with enough subtlety that you don't get the feeling the producers think you may have already forgotten how the show started.
What I truly like best about this show is that it's perfect for anytime I want to watch something but can't quite make up my mind what I'm in the mood for.  Since I no longer watch TV but only DVD's, it substitutes very well for just turning on the TV and taking pot luck - because every episode is complete in itself; and, even though the running theme is a haunted house, you don't have to place the episode you're watching in the context of the whole series. Although, I would caution that this show grows on you; watch it one night, and you'll find yourself wanting to watch it the next night even if you planned to watch something else.",1247961600,6,1742,4.774086378737541
3488856,5,B001BCUB46,"Discovery Channel's ""A Haunting"" Seasons 1-4 contains some of the creepiest stories I've ever seen reenacted on screen, all of which are based on actual events. The series is in a docu-drama format, i.e. the reenactments are done using actors, props etc, but these scenes are then interspersed with interviews with those who actually experienced the hauntings, paranormal investigators, etc. This format makes for a compelling series that keeps viewers engaged throughout the various episodes.

The episode list is as follows:
Season 1
Hell House
The Haunting of Summerwind
Echoes from the Grave
Cursed
Darkness Follows
Lake Club Horror
Gateway to Hell
The Diabolical

Season 2
Demon Child
Sallie's House
Ghost Soldier
Where Demons Dwell
House of the Dead
Hungry Ghosts
Dark Forest
A Haunting in Florida

Season 3
Fear House
The Attic
Hidden Terror
The Unleashed
A Haunting in Ireland
The Forgotten
The Wheatsheaf Horror
The Possessed
The Presence
The Dark Side

Season 4
Dark Wrath
The Awakening
The Calling
The Apartment
Spirits of the Dead
Where Evil Lurks
Spellbound
Echoes of the Past
Ghost Hunter
Stalked by Evil
Casa De Los Muertos
Monster in the Apartment
Legend Trippers

I have various favorites in the series, from Seasons 1-4. The production values are above average, and though the special effects are not extraordinary, the episodes are highly atmospheric, conveying a real sense of menace and dread, and inciting sympathy for the victims. The discounted price here on Amazon for all four seasons makes this DVD set a value buy. Highly recommended and a must-buy for fans of supernatural-themed shows.",1247961600,73,1615,5.196153846153846

A few comments left out from the original posting...

First, a complaint:
Enough with the Warrens!  As the favored go-to duo from the paranormal 70s on I realize my neighbors (and subsequent protege Zaffis) carried lots of cred (not to mention all sorts of baggage).  But half a dozen episodes where they come to the rescue?! One cringes every time they step over another threshold to pronounce the place riddled with E-vil. What Dr. William Roll was to Unsolved Mysteries (I also recommend their ghost episodes DVD set - see reviews),
Ed (God rest his soul) and Lorraine W too predictably were to A Haunting's producers.

Sadly there will be no new seasons of this quite respectable if rather simplistic but charmingly low-rent series.  Overall the stories reveal far more than they do separately - which I should have more clearly stated as my original point concerning pattern recognition.
Some rather droll examples:
Gee, dad, you never seem to notice the stuff we do, yet you've been acting awfully weird lately.  Or hows about: There's just something odder and more threatening about those shadowy looking things - I thought we were just dealing with some lonely folks who haven't reconciled themselves to passing on.  Finally, that perennial favorite: Gosh, after months if not years living in this creepy place while trying to avoid accepting the reality of our situation we couldn't help wondering why things just kept going wrong in our lives, our attitudes and behavior until it suddenly dawned - hey, we're really being influenced by... some kinda haunting!
************************************************************************************

Repeat viewings of most of these episodes prove quite worthwhile.

Particularly effective and deserving of special mention is the editing of sounds and images - through which most of the unsettling atmosphere and scares are conjured.

Techniques which, in most current knockoff horror junk, usually appear way too lookatme MTV gimmicky or Ghost House schlockish: electronically distorted whispers, groans, shriekings and creakings, as well as the whole modern arsenal of flashy grotesque cutting, defocusing and sickly color temperature tricks, are actually put to quite effective and even tasteful use.  Much credit is due the directors, production and technical crews, I am sure they have gone unsung for far too long. Likewise much of the acting, which is more effective because of the rather commonplace casting (which is not to disparage their often praiseworthy efforts).  One particularly noteworthy presence was the fellow who portrayed the psychic in Dark Forest.

As far as the often criticised similarity between many of these stories: pattern recognition. kiddies!  The truth of any event, especially those which appear anomolous, only becomes evident when it is repeated often enough to reveal its inner workings to those with the objectivity and true skepticism to acknowledge it.  Which, of course, is not to say that we are talking about documentaries here.  Every haunting is obviously jazzed up, simplified, reconfigured, even dumbed down for general audience consumption.  But overall they are quite worthwhile and, for those of us not already so fried by the usual amped-up teen horror fare, genuinely spooky.  Maybe in time the series can be brought back from the dead.  Until then, as Arch Obler used to say, lights out....",1245888000,3,3414,5.324022346368715
