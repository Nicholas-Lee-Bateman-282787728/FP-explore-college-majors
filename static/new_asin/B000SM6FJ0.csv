2887493,3,B000SM6FJ0,"Good moderately paced kickbox routine.  No yoga.  The warmup and cooldown contain stretches, but no yoga.  I would rate this a high beginner or low intermediate workout.",1191888000,12,169,5.185185185185185

2887495,4,B000SM6FJ0,If you want great instruction and are just learning this is a great DVD for you.  But if you have been doing a kickboxing routine for a awhile this might be to slow and simple,1382918400,,175,4.0
2887496,5,B000SM6FJ0,I absolutely LOVE every workout DVD this woman has out there but the kickboxing workouts ROCK!  You will see and feel the results of doing just the 30 min. w/o 3 times a week within a couple of weeks.  Excellent!,1374883200,,212,4.275
2887497,5,B000SM6FJ0,"I bought this because I was tired of all the aerobic dvd's repeating the same moves at a different pace or in a different order. If you feel a bit uncoordinated at first don't give up, just repeat until you get it. It was difficult at first but I kept staring over until I got the first few moves, punch, upper cut and block moves then on to the next. Be sure to be on a surface where your feet can move without resistance as they will need to pivot and turn for some moves. It may not seem like it but it will get your heart rate up! Haven't made it to the end but I'm getting a workout repeating to learn. Going at my own pace and I like.",1363478400,,640,3.8931297709923665
2887498,5,B000SM6FJ0,"This is the first kickboxing workout I have tried where I actually learned punches and kicks.  I have bought other workouts where the pace is so quick and unsteady I felt like I was waving my arms around swatting flys or with the kicks trying to do the can-can.  This is actually instructional.
The yoga part is only for warm up and cool down.  But the kickboxing is excellent!!",1317772800,2,378,4.449275362318841
2887499,5,B000SM6FJ0,"I have had this DVD for awhile but have never written a review because, until today, I'd only done the 30-minute express workout and the bonus abs routine. This is one of my must-have DVDs and I'm actually considering buying a spare copy just in case my current one expires from overuse.

Why I love this DVD:

- This is a perfect advanced beginners workout. (I recommend Violet Zaki's ""Killer Kicks"" for the absolute beginner.) I am such a klutz and have always had trouble with the footwork involved in kickboxing. Patricia Moreno, probably because she is a dance instructor, does the best job of breaking it down so that even I can follow/stumble along and (almost) keep up.

- The slow/practice portions are wonderful! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Working slowly but precisely is great for your body, plus it allows the faster segments to work as intervals.

- Moreno cues the combinations beautifully with reminders on form that keep you focused. Somehow she manages to be motivating without being effusive; I love her calm determination.

The 45-minute and 30-minute routines are completely different. (The 30-minute routine is not an edited version of the longer one.) The longer routine includes a nifty spin move and Moreno's instructions were so good that even I managed to (kinda) keep up, which is a first for me. The bonus abs is a standing routine with, IIRC, lots of balance work and is probably the only place on the DVD where you'll see any ""yoga fusion"" moves. Although, the precision of the slower kickboxing segments feel asana-like to me. Perhaps that's why I like them so much.

Anyway, this DVD is definitely a desert island disk for me. I think I'll go ahead and buy that spare copy.

(Note: Apparently, ""Cardio Burn Kickbox,"" is a reissue of this workout. Just a head up because ""Cardio Burn Kickbox"" is being offered at much better prices.)",1270944000,4,1874,4.801242236024844
2887500,5,B000SM6FJ0,"Hello, I competed in Taekwondo many years ago. After having surgery on both knees in a span of seven years, I still enjoy kickboxing workouts, but I prefer more low impact modifications. In Kickbox Yoga Fusion, Patricia Moreno starts with basic moves, and then builds up on them for a smooth workout without any jumping or jarring motions. The DVD includes a nice bonus kickbox core routine, a ""standing"" abs workout. I also recommend Moreno's Kickbox Core Cross Train DVD, which includes longer and faster segments for punching and kicking, but which is still moderately low impact. Both DVDs feature wonderful natural scenery from California or Utah.",1269216000,2,652,5.102803738317757
2887501,3,B000SM6FJ0,"Although I really like Patricia Moreno's yoga video, this is a bit too easy and slow moving.",1264377600,,92,4.470588235294118
2887502,4,B000SM6FJ0,"Good core workout, but the trainer gets really annoying with her constant jabbing and trying to be overly encouraging. I like encouragement, but she's really over the top with it to the point of annoying. The workout is good and if you do the moves correctly, you'll definitely feel it the next day!",1262736000,,299,4.660377358490566
2887503,3,B000SM6FJ0,"She pauses a lot during the workout which led me to continuously lose momentum. When I do these exercise videos I just want to go, go, go! Plus I had to add light-weights to the routine to make it more challenging. Overall I'd say it was just OK.",1253232000,,246,4.145833333333333
2887504,5,B000SM6FJ0,"The dvd begins with a warm up including yoga sretches then you go right into an extremely well-cued kickbox routine. I do not pick up moves easily and so I'm quite picky on what fitness dvds I keep...many trip me up and are given away...however, I was surprised that her teaching was clear enough that quickly iinto the routine I was following right along with punches, jabs, blocks, footwork and a very fun turn that swings the back foot to the front and makes you feel like a real pro.

Surpisinigly even though she'd slow down to show you how to clearly do steps (and also do them enough times before zapping you right into fast choreography so that you get them down first), my calorie burn and heart rate remained high. Higher than I expected.

I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calaoric burn and I only mention that because when I mention my caloric burn it is actually scientifically measured, not perceived exertion. I didn't feel worn out or knocked out and yet the combo of upper and lower body moves burned a whopping amount of calories in comparison to many of my other fitness dvds.

The setting appears to be a California hillside that is truly stunning and the energy level, in my opinion, is perfect. No one is yelling at you or doing fake ""wooooo ooooo! s"" like on some dvds I have...in fact the instructor cues happily and calmly and, more importantly, clearly.

The instrumental music has an Eastern feel and is actually, surpisingly, smooth and calming to the fast routine.

I have other kickboxing dvds but I really didn't get the moves down so well. It's easy to take this instruction and now do the other routines better because I ""get"" the movements more.

I try not to leave a review without a negative since no product is perfect but I feel this dvd was one of the best thought out as far as ensuring that everyone does the movements RIGHT and doesn't get tripped up AND gets a great caloric burn as well as some muscle work...I'm left without anything I can pan.

From beginner to advanced fitness buff anyone can do this routine and get great results. I own over 100 fitness dvds and this one is a new favorite for my daily workouts.  And, trust me, I have zero coordination.",1251417600,11,2207,4.5
2887505,4,B000SM6FJ0,"I have recently started doing routines by Patricia Moreno and also have her Kickbox Core workout. There are several things about her workouts that I love.  First, she has the perfect pace, not too slow and not too fast, allowing me to understand the moves and proper form before adding on another element.  At the end of the routine you have put together a fairly long sequence of kicks, jabs, uppercuts and turns.  She emphasizes both power and good form, making sure you have proper alignment before moving on to the next series of moves.

This dvd is no different. Her cuing is excellent.  The workout spans about 50 minutes, with about an 8 minute or so warm-up and cool-down.  I really didn't think there was much yoga involved, but that didn't really bother me, they were good stretches, and that is what really matters.  The workout itself I would rank at an intermediate level or a beginner that has had some prior kickboxing experience.

As always, her choice of venue for the workout is wonderful-Santa Barbara, with a glimpse towards the ocean in the background.  The music flows without being in the way or distracting.

Also included on this dvd is a 30 minute ""Express Workout"", which is nice to have if you would like to do some kickboxing but are a bit pressed for time.

I very much enjoy her videos and will continue to buy hers due to the high quality of work-out that she delivers.

If you would like a little preview of her workouts, as well as many others this link may be helpful for you as even a good workout may not be for everyone: collagevideo.com.  Here you can see a minute or two of the actual workout and decide if it is the kind of style/intensity that you prefer in a workout.

Good health to you!",1237680000,5,1731,4.4888178913738015
2887506,5,B000SM6FJ0,"As someone who had NO exercise routine this is a wonderful way to start.  Patricia Moreno is a great instructor and has an easy, pleasant way about her.  It took a couple of times to get the moves down but was fun along the way.",1237334400,,228,4.044444444444444
2887507,4,B000SM6FJ0,"I really did enjoy this workout and it brought on a good sweat for me.  I've been doing P90X and on cardio days I've been looking for Kenpo/Kickboxing tapes to shake things up on cardio day.

One of the things I like best is that when she says right or left she's talking about my right or left...not hers.  That always did annoy me about other tapes.  The scenery was also beautiful where the video was shot.  I also liked the instructor.  I didn't find Patricia annoying at all, she came across as friendly and inspiring.

This cardio work out is one of those where you build piece by piece of a routine then slowly put them all together by the end of the workout.  I found the pieces of the workout not too hard to follow and she did great cueing to remind you what was to come next.

My only true complaint was that after she puts the final piece together in the workout it seemed like you only did the full routine once, maybe twice and then that was it!  I was actually surprised.  I would have thought the final routine would have been run through a few times.  So that was a slight dissapointment.

Also this was called a Yoga Fusion workout but I didn't see any Yoga that I know of.  Maybe some of the stretches could have been a little Yoga inspired but overall that was ok with me because I bought this for the kickboxing anyhow.",1228003200,3,1340,4.24505928853755
2887508,4,B000SM6FJ0,"I am a black belt and certified instructor in TaeKwonDo, so I am very picky about ""kickboxing"" workout videos.  They are usually either way too complex for people who are not trained in martial arts (i.e., the moves required at the pace demanded present a very high injury risk for those who have not been formally trained in how to do them), or they are done by workout instructors who don't seem to have ever done kickboxing outside of an aerobics class.

This is an excellent kickboxing workout video for everyone, martial artists and non-martial artists alike, and Patricia Moreno has clearly had formal kickboxing training.  The moves are basic enough so that there should be a low risk of injury, but they are strung together in a way that provides great opportunities to practice strength, flexibility, and precision.  Martial artists can always benefit from practicing these things, no matter how complicated or basic the moves, and the moves are very accessible to non-martial artists.  The cardiovascular workout is great!

The only complaints I have about this video are that there really should be more stretching before and after the workout to reduce the risk of muscle pulls and injury (I strongly recommend you do this on your own before starting the workout), and one of Patricia Moreno's backup kickbox girls is just terrible!  She has no precision and no strength behind her moves, which is unfortunate, since Moreno emphasizes both of these elements quite heavily.

I strongly recommend this video to those looking for a great accessible kickboxing workout.",1219276800,13,1577,5.038461538461538
2887509,4,B000SM6FJ0,"one of the things i appreciate about gaiam's workouts is that they are mature - they don't contain the usual porn-like music, cleavage and stupidity seen on other DVDs.  this DVD presents workouts that are fun, easy to follow, and really get the heart pumping.  no yoga, but it's not needed here.",1216771200,2,296,4.673076923076923
2887510,5,B000SM6FJ0,"Patricia Moreno is an absolutely wonderful instructor.  Her routines are very fun, and adds her own elements of style and form to every exercise.  I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to every level.",1211068800,2,205,4.828571428571428

2887512,5,B000SM6FJ0,"Patricia Moreno does an excellent job of slowly building a sequence of kickboxing steps with jabs, crosses, hooks, kicks, balancing.  I don't see much yoga, but for more of that I highly recommend her Yoga Dance Fusion DVD.  This kickboxing routine instead is excellent for building strength through your legs, core, and upper body.  I have been exercising steadily several days per week for several years.  I'm in good physical shape and am slim and healthy.  I still get a good workout (including cardio) as the routine builds in speed and complexity.  I do alternate this DVD with other ones for other days of the week, but this one still leaves me with sore abs and overall core (good kind of sore), and sometimes sore shoulders and upper arms too.",1201132800,20,752,4.746153846153846
2887513,2,B000SM6FJ0,"This is one in a series of four new videos that have been release from Gaiam. I love the two with Tanja Djelevic, but I don't really care for the other two with Patricia Moreno. She presents kickboxing drills and the routine is not all that fun. You get 50 and 30 minute routines, plus a 10 minute bonus ab workout. The ab workout was the only thing I liked on the DVD.

For kickboxing DVDs that provide a great workout and lots of fun too, I recommend Quickfix Total Cardio Kick with Janis Saffell and 10 Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp with Keli Roberts instead.",1195689600,12,565,4.380952380952381

8205930,5,B000SM6FJ0,"This is a great workout dvd. However, I want to clarify one thing. This DVD, Kickbox yoga fusion, is the exact same workout dvd as one of her other DVDs called cardio burn kickbox. I made the mistake of buying both. Too bad, because I love Patricia Moreno and would love to get even more of her workouts. I'm just not sure why they marked these as two different dvds(?)",1483401600,3,369,4.285714285714286

8205932,5,B000SM6FJ0,I love how Patricia emphasizes precision and how the exercises progress. I was also impressed by the express workout and core workout bonus feature. This was a great addition to my library of workout DVDs.,1446249600,,205,4.885714285714286

8205938,2,B000SM6FJ0,I want my money back.  Can I get a refund?  This video was a lame attempt at capitalizing on the Taebo kick boxing trend.  I was hoping it was more in line with Ms. Moreno's Intensati workouts but it was far from that.  I can't believe I was less informed about the fruitfulness of this video or the lack thereof.  It might have been good in the heyday past but it's not a keeper or something you want to do more than three times.,1400544000,,430,4.071428571428571
