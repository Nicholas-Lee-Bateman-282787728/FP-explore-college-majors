8021864,3,B0002450EU,"Most of these cartoons have been issued before in the original 8 tape release of George of the Jungle. Unfortunately, this time it is only George.  The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included.  I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.

THE GOOD NEWS: This tape is recorded in the SP quality mode!

Tape includes:
""The Sultan's Pearl,"" (from Vol. 5)
""The Agent,"" (aka The Forest's Prime Evil)
""Animal Power,"" (aka Next Time Take The Train from Vol. 6)
""Little Scissors.""",1147478400,,576,4.787878787878788
8021865,3,B0002450EU,"This short tape (less than 30 min) contains four episodes of ""George"" cartoons. These were fun to watch once or twice, but, ultimately, for adults, they just don't have the staying power of Jay Ward's finest work.  There is a bit of the subversive element and zanyness that make Rocky & Bullwinkle (and the related cartoons) so good, but it just not on the same level.  Its a bit dumbed down, certainly not as sharp or satirical, and doesn't have the ongoing story arcs of ""Rocky..."".

That being said, fans and collectors of Jay Ward material may want to have this.  Kids seem to like it too, I introduced ""George"", via this tape, to my nieces and nephews (ages 2 to 10) and they liked it enough to want to keep the tape.

The ""Jungle Fever"" and ""Monkey Businees"" tapes follow the same format of four ""George"" episodes.  Other tapes such as ""World according to George"", ""Gullible Travels"" mix in ""Super Chicken"" and ""Ton Slick"" cartoons - I enjoyed these more and will probably keep a few of them around as part oy collection.",1111881600,5,1027,4.554347826086956
