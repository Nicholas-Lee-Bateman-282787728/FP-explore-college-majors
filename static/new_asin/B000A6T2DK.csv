2372972,5,B000A6T2DK,"Finally... a DVD of Tanya Tucker in concert!!!.. HIP HIP HOORAY!....I own the DVD of her from the 80's at Church Street Station and have been waiting for a DVD concert that would include her BIG HITS of the 90's.. NOW WE HAVE IT!.. but as on the CD. the listing here is not the one on the DVD.. they left out ""Oh What It Did To Me"" and "" Love Me Like You Used To"".. but no matter.. this is great.. i will watch and enjoy it for years to come.. Tanya does not make it out to California much anymore so as I grow older.. anytime I want to watch a concert by MY PERSONAL ALL TIME FAVORITE. i will just pop this DVD in....with a career that includes 9 # one hits.....29 Top Ten Hits.. and 58 Top 40 singles.. 4 Platinum and 13 Gold albums, she of course cannot sing the songs everyone would count as their favorites.. but this collection features most of her BIGGEST....I love hearing the audience applaud this SUPERSTAR.... makes it all worth watching.. and she looks great at 47!!!!.... THANKS SMITH GROUP FOR THIS WONDERFUL DVD.... "" A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be"" is included.. I LOVE THIS SONG.. it returned Tanya to the Country top 40 in 2002. Too bad radio won't support her anymore.. the TANYA CD she issued in 2002 is one of the best country albums in years.. i do encourage everyone to pick up a copy of that too. ... The song "" I Can Do That"" coupled with ""A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be"" and.. ""Borrowed Wings"" will make you glad you did... but back to this DVD... GREAT PERFORMANCE TANYA!!!.... AWESOME CONCERT!!.. THANKS TO THE BAND AND THE BACKUP SINGERS TOO.. ALL DID A # 1 JOB!!!.. Please, sir.. I'd like some more.............",1132790400,18,1633,4.288025889967638
2372973,4,B000A6T2DK,"Let me first say, I love Tanya Tucker!  Always have and always will.  ""T"" rocks on this DVD.  The casual setting at Billy Bob's really showcase what a talented and down to earth performer Tanya really is.  The show mostly consists of her traditional country hits. I really missed hearing songs from ""TNT"", ""Tear Me Apart"", ""Should I Do It"",and ""Dreamlover.""  With a career spanning some 30+ years, I think a complete retrospective is called for, in fact, I know it is.  I would, however, have liked to have seen Tanya perform more of her recent releases.  I really missed ""Soon."" Maybe another concert DVD (part 2) is in order! ""Two Sparrows in a Hurricane"" was a big highlight, as well as ""A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be"", from her latest album, ""Tanya"". It's a great song, and album as well. Tanya, keep in coming love...",1132790400,5,819,4.568493150684931
2373034,5,B000A6T2DK,Tanya is excellent in this about one hour show she has lots of fun and is really a person that can be sassy and sexy with her raspy voice. She has many  hits and this video has her at her best. The only thing i didn't like was the camera was to close on certain times to her face and was dark or discolored by the lights on stage sometimes but overall great sound and have played at least 3 times since I bought it,1283212800,,414,3.8705882352941177
2373035,4,B000A6T2DK,I thought this was a very good performance of some of Tanya's greatest hits though not all of them.,1191283200,,99,4.2631578947368425
2373036,4,B000A6T2DK,"if you like tanya tucker, you will love this dvd tanya live singing all her hit's and more at the famous billy bob's fort worth texas, as good as being in the audiance [well nearly]worth a purchase",1179014400,,197,4.351351351351352
2373037,5,B000A6T2DK,This is a most for anyone who enjoys being entertained. Tucker is  without a doubt the best entertainer out there. She performs every song with all she has. This dvd will show just how underated she is. Tanya could cough and sound better than the new so called singers out there. The sad part is they cut out most of Tanyas humorous remarks.,1176163200,,341,4.412698412698413
2373038,4,B000A6T2DK,Live at Billy Bob's was very entertaining.  I have always liked Tanya's type of music. This show was lively and she did all her old songs.  I will definitely be watching this on again and again.,1163030400,,194,4.361111111111111
2373039,5,B000A6T2DK,"Age may have slowed down the party girl somewhat, but she can still perform with the best of 'em. We can only hope she makes MORE concert CDs. WOW!!! You go girl!!!!",1156636800,2,165,4.1875
2373040,5,B000A6T2DK,"I grew up listening to Tanya Tucker thanks to my dads x-wife. For the first three years of my life ""DELTA DAWN"" and many others were drilled into my head daily. I got the chance to see Tanya perform at the New York State Fair back in the 80's. And she was awesome then as she is now!! I was at least 2-3 people, behind Tanya giving an interview for a local TV station here in New York. She was at that time holding her baby girl, Presley Tanita. I remember she had a headband with a bow on Presley's head. Many may not know, but it was Tanya's sister LaCosta that was supposed to have the biggest country career. Although LaCosta does sing, she's not reccognized as well as her sister Tanya. But during that 80's show I saw.. Tanya brought her sister LaCosta. I remember she sang at least a couple of songs. One was ""Ashes Of Love."" The old Johnny and Jack bluegrass song. And it was good!! I've seen ""TUCKERVILLE"" on TV many times. And have had several of her CD's throughout my 36 yrs. All I can say is Keep on a rockin' girl!! 5 stars for a job well done on a fabulous career!!",1153267200,6,1080,4.147619047619048
2373041,5,B000A6T2DK,"The concert was great in person, The Texas Playboys helped her finish the show. That says it all right there.....",1147478400,2,113,4.7
2373042,5,B000A6T2DK,"I am a huge Tanya Tucker Fan and personally anything that she puts  out is great in my opinion.  I would strongly recommend this DVD---Tanya put on an awsome show.  I wish that Tanya would start receiving more recognition for her talent----I think anyone would enjoy this DVD---it portrays just how down to earth Tanya really is and what a great performer Tanya ""STILL"" is.",1141776000,5,373,4.707692307692308
2373043,5,B000A6T2DK,"I have to say that I have been a fan of Tanya's since the 70""s so this is a biased review somewhat, however I looked at the DVD as a novice. I was worried that if a true Concert Video would come out it would be flat and not worthy of her work.  I have to say that I have been to probably 25-30 of her concerts and I feel that we now have the true Home version of her concerts.

I threw it in the DVD player with many hopes that it would show the True Tanya concert that has thrilled me through the years. I have to say that I have usually fallen into tears at many Tanya concerts and this DVD had the same effect! I am in love with the effect that Tanya has on me.

Tanya is a strong talent that while recognized, has not been recognized enough. This DVD shows how a woman in her 46 years has maintained a strong life in her family and with her fans.

This is a great accent to her TLC Show TUCKERVILLE!

The bonus tracks are great showing more of her connection to her fans, parents and at the time the victims of the Tsunami in Sri Lanka

I highly recommend anyone to buy this and look at her and her work.  She is a True Country Legend!",1132963200,13,1139,3.9047619047619047
8075280,4,B000A6T2DK,enjoyed it verymuch,1516060800,,19,5.666666666666667
8075281,3,B000A6T2DK,I have seen Tanya Tucker  live two  times.  She puts on a  great show.  And is one of my all time favorite singers.  This is a very good concert she does some of her early songs like The Jamestown Ferry and of course delta Dawn.  And some of her  later songs like Two Sparrows In a Hurricane.  But to me she is still acting lie a teenage female Elvis.  And she is too old for that.  I do think she is long over due for The County Music Hall Of Fame.,1508457600,,449,3.8241758241758244
8075282,5,B000A6T2DK,A must have dvd for any Tanya Tucker fan.,1445558400,,41,3.6666666666666665
8075283,3,B000A6T2DK,"It is a well-done recording of her live show, and the special features were interesting but brief.",1437264000,,98,4.823529411764706

8075285,5,B000A6T2DK,I really loved this!  I've watched it four times already and will watch it again and again.  Tanya Tucker does not disappoint her fans with her mesmerizing style of entertainment and her raspy county voice.  Love it!,1407024000,,216,4.783783783783784
8075286,5,B000A6T2DK,I love Tanya tucker and her music. Great purchase and just love it.. But I wish they would release Tuckerville on dvd cuz I also enjoyed watching her show as well.. She rocks...,1375142400,,177,4.393939393939394
8075287,5,B000A6T2DK,"No matter what people say,Tanya Tucker still puts on a great concert. She may show her age,but she's like a fine wine,still she can put on a good show. She sings all of her hits and I'm glad it's in my collection.",1372809600,,213,4.095238095238095
8075288,4,B000A6T2DK,This is a nice video if you like Tanya Tucker.  It is not great but I did enjoy it.  She performed a lot of her most popular songs from years ago.  Her performance is very casual.,1359849600,,179,3.9166666666666665
8075289,5,B000A6T2DK,"I had seen this years ago and loved it then.  When I found it on the Prime Time Video list, just had to see it again.",1350086400,,117,3.5
