4062736,4,B00331RHEU,"No doubt the math masters of the world will award (Prime Number) 5 stars. The mathematics is there as well as very interesting fact and stories of where some of the great numbers thoughts generated from in history. The camera takes you on a Grande Tour of places of the world, beginning with Egypt and the pyramids, in explaining the Pythagorean theorem beginnings, Golden Ratio instances from ancient times, topology, axioms, postulates, and ...

Well, my own educational masters' degree failed to keep up with all of the terminology, and theory, causing me to award only 4 stars. It is my own mathematical ignorance that causes me to fully enjoy this educational DVD set, where others will, and have, called it dazzling. Even at moments when my depth of numbers faltered, bits of facts and stories of historical importance, surfaced to make it a learning experience. Excellent footage, and a well informed mathematical professor/host leads those most interested in math through it's roots as well as it's yet to be explored regions of thought, shape, relationships, time, and count.

Using computer images, today's math in visual form, the patterns and social relationships are investigated, questioned, and philosophized over. It's not for your average viewer, not exactly entertainment; it's a documentary engaging the mind toward the relevance of numbers.

Set includes ""The Music of the Primes"" (78 min documentary) in the bonus stuff. A completely different DVD with 3 Episodes:
1-- with a 2000-yr tradition
2-- of the 20th century attempts
3-- tech advancements
all leaving the Riemann's hypothesis unproven.

Bonus also includes SDH SUBTITLES, Viewer's guide with episode highlights, questions, and math bibliography and glossary. The glossary includes ""chaos theory"" which I first thought reflected on my own insight into the discussion of ""irrational numbers.""

Concluding:
My hypothesis is: there is an ""imaginary number"" of viewers, perhaps a ""prime number"", that will indeed find the statement ""'THE STORY OF MATH' is WONDERFUL"" to be a theorem, proven true by personal experience.

If you think Pythagorean Theorem is a dinosaur, then you probably are not a good fit for ""THE STORY OF MATH"" DVD.  :)  :-}  ;~)  Are infinite smiley-faces probable?",1265673600,72,2261,5.2555555555555555

4062738,5,B00331RHEU,"Professor Marcus du Sautoy (Oxford) takes us through a very delightful and picturesque journey around the world of mathematics. The 4 part series visits the various centers where mathematical thought flourishes (Middle East, Greece, China, India, Europe, and America). It is discriptive and lightly technical.

4062742,5,B00331RHEU,This video is fantastic for giving context to all the math skills and larger concepts you learned or teach. I bought this for my students and some fo them even wanted to try soe fo  the methods they saw demonstrated. Dr. Marcus DuSautoy traces the development of mathematics through the ages and across the globe. I wish they would do a fifth part going into some of the most modern branches of mathematics!,1392249600,,407,4.575342465753424

4062745,1,B00331RHEU,"This set of videos makes some assumptions that are not accurate. If you're wanting to fill your head with mysticism this might be a great set of videos for you. In one section it tries to tie the Golden Ratio to artwork and the Egyptian Pyramids, but this can easily be debunked.",1381795200,3,279,4.384615384615385
4062746,2,B00331RHEU,"As a high school math teacher I'm always looking for entertaining and informative videos.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there aren't many, so I was pretty happy to see all the 5-star reviews for this DVD set.  Sadly, after forcing myself through the first two episodes, my hope for this set has all but died.

What I like: good breadth of topics and, for the limited depth it goes into, it's accurate (barring a few misleading analogies).

What I dislike: superficial treatment of topics -- it has many opportunities to explain concepts and algorithms in more depth, but instead moves on and leaves the watcher with only a taste.  I may be judging it more harshly because I was already familiar with most of the content, but I felt it passed up innumerable golden opportunities to teach a lay audience more about how mathematics works -- something beyond, ""Gee, aint that neat?""  For my purposes as a teacher I don't entirely mind the gaps -- I could stop the video and discuss with my class why something just shown actually works, but if you're not watching this in class, I think you'll find it frustrating.

Moving from substance to style, the videos are awash with cheesy special effects and unintentionally comedic dialog and ""action"" scenes.  Production is amateurish and distracting.  I had higher hopes from something sold by the BBC.

I'll watch the last two episodes and update my review if necessary, but I'm not holding my breath.",1371945600,31,1451,4.791164658634538

4062750,4,B00331RHEU,"I purchased this as a gift for a ten year old who is really into math. I previewed it just to verify that it was age appropriate.
In this case I did not think that it was appropriate due to the innuendos to sex and references to religion and war atrocities.
This video is more suited to high school aged children. Although I personally liked it and actually learned a lot from it I decided to give it to the parents instead and let them decide a proper time to give it.
Recommended for age 15 and up. I got Donald in Mathmagic Land instead.",1356220800,8,540,4.152380952380953

4062755,5,B00331RHEU,"I really enjoyed this series, and actually showed it to my high school senior math class in 8-10 minute installments.  However, unless the viewer is somewhat familiar with the higher math topics, it leaves unanswered the question, ""what practical needs led to these discoveries.""",1312588800,4,279,5.340909090909091
4062756,5,B00331RHEU,"Thank you.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal!

As for The Story Of Math(s), I have to say it really is an amazing educational tool, in that it makes the subject utterly fascinating.  For a long time I thought I was a math hater, but it turns out I just didn't know math.  I was thinking merely of quadratic equations and my Algebra II teacher in high school who, between friends, was a little bit tired of the job at the time.  I can't blame her.  We were a thankless bunch.  If my Algebra II teacher had been Marcus du Sautoy I think I might be some kind of engineer or astronomer today.

So, I am far from a math aficionado. In fact my basic calculation methods are pretty pathetic.  There are times that I will resort to finger counting just to be sure.  Oh shut up.  You check your front door five times when you know it's locked so tell it to Roger Bannister.  My point is this... I was never lost or confused while watching this documentary.  In fact I was consistently amazed, fascinated and enthralled.  It helps to have some kind of interest in numbers.  Mine stems from the Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio, although I have a rudimentary understanding of both. Episode Two ""The Genius Of The East"" gave me a much more solid working knowledge of each.  Basically, I am very intrigued by CONCEPTS of mathematics and this program was able to translate my concepts into factual representations from the real world, in order to help me wrap my unconditioned brain around the ideas.  The use of live scenes as backgrounds for graphical overlays is simple in a way, but this simplicity allows the complex concepts (complex to ME, genius) to pop off the screen and be more readily digested.  Being able to represent numbers or quantities in physical space and move them around, slicing and dicing as needed is just a great visual tool for something that can seem so abstract to the uninitiated.

As touched on in the title, a big part of why these talks work, is the person speaking.  I was unfamiliar with du Sautoy before this but I'm a fan now.  I was actually a little amazed watching him step gingerly across a complex set of dye pits in India while explaining how people first developed ideas like negative numbers, changing zero from a placeholder to a number in its own right... and infinity itself.  I would have fallen in just trying to recite the alphabet while attempting this.  The host comes of as confident and authoritative while still being interesting to watch and engaging in tone and style. Being able to mentally multitask while expounding on the topics covered here is no small feat.

The other great thing about this set is that it's not just The Story Of Math. The set also contains a three part series on prime numbers which is a great bonus. If you think you aren't interested in them... once you finish watching the main set, you probably will be.  They really are pretty cool.",1309305600,25,2916,4.517175572519084
4062757,4,B00331RHEU,"An excellent stool for middle school age students.  However for the student who is more advance in Math, a more detailed explanations of the equations would have been more useful.",1305158400,7,179,4.966666666666667
4062758,4,B00331RHEU,"I found this quite informative.  I think this would be mostly of interest to those somewhat familiar with the subject.  My only criticism is that the narration is very rapid and with a subject like this, it might be frustrating to those who have little knowledge of mathematics.  To those who can follow, however, it is a definite plus and provides little known information on ancient mathematics, notably, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece.",1304985600,4,437,5.041666666666667
4062759,3,B00331RHEU,"I got a 4.0 in calculus 2 and my girlfriend is going into Med School, and we kept getting steamrolled by the explanations.  I finally realized that it was because he explains the key conceps in math jargon.  He doesn't review what he's comparing it to, and sadly, they don't use visuals correctly - all they had to do is write the standard math on the bottom so we could see it as he uses eggs and peaches to explain the problems (which is VERY confusing let me tell u).  He uses words I have no idea what they mean. What's an axyum? Yeah I looked it up, but that's not the point.  I don't want to keep pausing the video in order to figure out what they are talking about.  Still, the video is cool from a historical perspective.  Rent this if you're curious about math - you'll still get a rough idea of historical math.  It is a pretty show - excellent cinematography and cultural diversity.",1301184000,11,893,4.279761904761905

4062761,5,B00331RHEU,"This series is very enjoyable, even for people who typically don't enjoy math.  The subject matter is presented so that the viewer begins to understand not only math concepts, but also some of the human drama behind calculus, for example.",1294012800,5,238,4.95
4062762,5,B00331RHEU,"I know many of you will read the title of this review and think ""well that really sounds hard to believe,"" or write off my enthusiasm as being a mere post-movie dazzlement effect. Really though, when you think about it, it isn't that hard to believe, is it? How many good Math documentaries are there?

Finding good science documentaries is pretty easy. They're on pretty much any cable channel (or PBS) that features these kinds of programs (NOVA, Scientific American, or other similar programs on channels like the Science Channel, the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, etc). But Math documentaries? Those are hard to come by.

This is part of why this documentary is such a gem. Most Math DVDs out there are, in contrast with programs like NOVA that make science interesting, just people explaining formulas in front of a markerboard for an hour. This is not to say there's anything wrong with that, but only to say that there aren't that many production-quality documentaries about Math out there with the goal of entertaining a mass audience while teaching them some interesting facts and priming their interest on the subject.

Since this DVD accomplishes all of that and then some, all with an interesting historical narrative in the background, I can wholeheartedly award it 5 stars. While it isn't hugely more interesting or well-done than a comparable science episode about physics or something on NOVA, it is nonetheless almost the best in its class (Math documentaries) because so few of these types of movies exist in the first place.

Being the first of its kind that I've come across be so successful in this way, I'm happy to give it 5 stars and a recommendation for those who are interested in learning more about Math (and being assisted by beautiful computer-generated imagery) to help accomplish it in an enjoyable and fascinating manner.",1284854400,70,1864,4.964743589743589
4062763,5,B00331RHEU,"Excellent documentary on the history of mathematics. Even though I am not a mathematician, the documentary was very easy to understand.

4062766,5,B00331RHEU,"I fell in love with this BBC series while studying for a series of math exams. Marcus Du Sautoy is the real deal -- an accomplished mathematician with a knack for storytelling. And the story of maths is indeed a good story! Du Sautoy presents the history of mathematics in a lively and accessibly way, focusing on historical characters and places as well as why a given discovery was or is important. I've watched some of the episodes more than once -- that's how engaging they are. He doesn't skip over the petty squabbles over credit or the cultural context, and that's a big part of what makes the series fun. Even the non-math people I've shared this series with have enjoyed it. Highly recommended for non-mathematical and mathematical audiences alike.",1279670400,80,757,4.786259541984733

there is nothing wrong about the DVD and you don't need to have a mathematician with you to understand the concepts, but it helps...
A great reference movie to understand the systems we use every day (based on 10 in the metric system; based on 60 from the Assyrians that we use to measure time), how were they developed and how the are used today.
