4062688,5,B0032W5Z8U,"I am impressed. This movie had me going all the way through to the point that I frequently squirmed, covered my face, and yelled at the main character (I really get into movies). The characters were believable, the actors did an excellent job, especially Milo Ventimiglia whose character was so well developed that he felt like a real person to me. The sound effects, music, and the way the movie was filmed were very clever, as they gave subtle and abrupt clues as to what was really happening. It was a very tense and exciting film, but the story never got confusing, unintelligent, stupid, nor did it take off on irrelevant tangents. I will watch this movie again, but later because it really did freak me out. If you like suspense, sexy actors, and a little bit of artistic weirdness, this movie is for you. I highly recommend it.",1325462400,3,834,4.604026845637584
4062689,2,B0032W5Z8U,"This movie has a good synopsis, but the soundtrack killed it. The music just doesn't go along with the movie's story. The noises at certain scenes either startle you, or make you think something's happening inside your own house.",1275782400,3,229,4.897435897435898
4062690,4,B0032W5Z8U,"Order of Chaos is a surprisingly edgy film by Vince Vieluf, in his directorial debut.  The cinematography is great, and I appreciated the style of editing (frenetic at times, which not all viewers will like).  The shots are framed well, and I enjoyed Vieluf's use of lighting.  The film has a hard electronic score, largely Darkwave and Industrial, that works perfectly.  I also loved the voiceovers by Alan Watt of ""Cutting Through the Matrix"" fame.

Order of Chaos has a skeleton crew cast, but what Vince Vieuluf has to work with is choice.  Rhys Coiro (24) stars as passive worker bee John, opposite Milo Ventimiglia (Heroes) who plays his aggressive new colleague and neighbor Rick.  Mimi Rogers is a fox as John's boss, though neither she nor Samantha Mathis get as much screen time as I would have expected for veteran actors.

I felt at times that the story didn't have much meat on it's bones, even though the presentation was great.  The relationship between the two colleagues smacked a bit too much of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt in Fight club, particularly the evolution (or self-destruction) of Rhys Coiro's character.  The film's end was surprising, though it will still leave you with questions.  To politely contradict another reviewer's comment, the DVD's brilliant cover art has absolutely everything to do with the film.

Shot with only a million-dollar budget, Order of Chaos is a bold and edgy psychological thriller.  It's a great example of what happens when directors avoid sticking to what's safe, and focus on redefining what a movie could be.",1269561600,11,1566,4.931297709923665
4062691,4,B0032W5Z8U,"Admittedly, I ordered this for a few of my Heroes fans that dig this Milo Ventimiglia guy, and I do not feel they will be disappointed - they just won't be putting this at the top of their list.

The story follows two lawyers vying for the same job success - in their diametrically opposed ways. Rhys Coiro (most noted for his Entourage and 24 runs) gives a creepy showing here of a scrip drug addled and melancholy worker bee, while Milo plays the outgoing, hedonistic and mysterious new neighbor/co-worker. The plot is simple enough about doing what is perceived as right by the varying individuals, but the filming style is what makes this a love/hate film.

Vieluf (first noticed in Rat Race) chose to go with the hard Nine Inch Nails-style music score, fast edit visuals, quick/violent imagery, fast-forward runs and a strange mix of perspective filming angles. In other words, this can be a very tiring watch if you are not in the mood for this. The picture quality is solid, and the 5.1 gets a significant usage (especially from the music), the special features include:

* Commentary by Vieluf - you have to really be into this guy, but it does showcase the indie spirit - 12 day shoot, no money, some good actors and a skeleton crew.
* Origins of Chaos, 8:15 minutes. A long music video montage of this guy's inspiration (melancholy footage in his house), some production stuff all overlaid with a texting of his thoughts. If you are sitting on the fence - watch this first - if you hate it skip the movie as it is 90 minutes of the same thing.
* Downloadable track of the main music by Which. Very metallic, NIN kind of sound, I put it on the store's system.

Region 1 coded, cover art has nothing to with the film. 2.5 stars for the film, 1.5 for the quality and extra features. Not an outright recommendation, but the film will have a following and I could not discredit it/rate it lower just because of the filming style. The ending is slightly ambiguous after investing the time, but it follows the theme of the movie.",1268611200,7,2032,4.528610354223433

4062697,2,B0032W5Z8U,Stupid and boring until the end. The scumbag is killed with his own gun. Poetic justice is used on a self-help thug. He(John) was psyched out by Rick until the end when Rick pushed too hard and was killed by his actions.,1467158400,,220,4.261904761904762

4062701,5,B0032W5Z8U,For those that like bad boys Milo Ventimiglia is it in this movie. If he moved in close to me or someone I cared about and acted like he did here I would be terrified but there are people in life that really act like that and he is a great actor to pull it off and probably a woman magnet for those that like bad boys! I liked the movie very much.,1427068800,,347,3.767123287671233

8387674,5,B0032W5Z8U,"Personally I liked this movie but as I said in my review headline I'm an independent film freak. No this doesn't mean I like all indie films i am very picky. OOC caught me by surprise as I wasn't expecting it to be as intense but Rhys and Milo usually choose well. Basically it's about a streamlined lawyer- or something that has to do with justice system- whose basically never made a mistake in his life and leads a very basic boring routine lifestyle of work and wife. Then he meets Rick, a RicoSuav-JekyllHyde who is a savant at working as hard as he party's. You have to see this from the perspective of someone who has never experienced ""the wild side""  or any other mtv's true life events a day in their existence. That is until he met Rick his next door neighbor and straggles the main protagonist into a club thats supposed to look like a seedy underworld or the dark side of daily life, where those who are drones to the system can let loose and indulge in their wildest fantasies. Then john who is a bit stand off-ish at first of Ricks ways, finally gives in and goes all out, cutting off his scripts, drinking to excess, etc. I can't say this movie was predictable because I did not see the end of the film coming AT ALL. Honestly it reminded me a lot of Thirteen(Nikki Reed, EvanRachelWood, HollyHunter. 2003) only with grown men in business suits. There were also many scenes of CNN like headlines on war and chaotic events going on in the world (or at least the US) which may or may not have been a dose of artistic symbolism that went way over my head. But to be frank the basic underlying meaning was ""KNOW thy neighbor"". Do you know who your neighbor is?",1478217600,2,1672,4.358974358974359
8387675,1,B0032W5Z8U,"The cinematography was excellent. The acting was really good. That's it! The  story  was too artsy and I assume that  the screenplay, the director or story are to blame for the inability  for me to understand what this was actually about.  I  forced myself to watch it until the end. It truly was chaos - but there was no order.",1473292800,2,328,4.383333333333334
