7878768,5,630488348X,"Charles Durning was the narrator. I remember reading that he was landing on Omaha Beach. This was the best Normandy invasion of all time. There were planes bombing the Nazis, and the airborne troops were landing in the night. At Omaha Beach, several allied soldiers died. Some didn't make it. It was real, and the diaries read by a French woman and American soldiers was enlightening. This is what changed the Nazi invasion of Europe. The British, Canadian and American soldiers pushed toward Berlin, as did the Russians from the east. A ""Great Crusade.""",1391385600,,554,4.904255319148936
7878769,5,630488348X,"This is a compelling account, produced for the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day, that goes beyond the landings and covers the very personal aspect of the six-week-long battle to secure Normandy against German counterattack.  It is told thru the words of Soldiers on both sides and the French that were caught in the way of this intense struggle.  This tape is well worth aquiring for anyone interested in the Normandy campaign and is a document of the deeply personal experiences of people in war, and also the profound emotional toll war has on those directly involved and those who wait at home.  I cannot recommend it too highly.  In my opinion, it is the most moving documentary I have from WWII.  I highly recommend it.  I cannot understand why this gem has not been brought out on DVD.",1375660800,,788,4.7153284671532845

Of all the material in my World War II library, though, this video is unquestionably the best production in explaining the build-up, execution and post-invasion results of this most famous day in World War II.  The script is outstanding, concise and to the point, and the selection of Charles Durning, a World War II combat veteran himself, as the narrator was brilliant.  The material included in the narration is wonderfully organized and is very enlightening; even the most knowledgeable World War II historian can learn something from this video.

My only complaint, if I really have to have one, is that this 1994 production has never been released on DVD, but that's why I still own a video tape player.  If you MUST have a DVD, invest in a VHS/DVD player/recorder so you can make your own DVD from the tape.  They're pretty cheap to buy these days.",1284854400,4,1008,4.693181818181818
7878771,5,630488348X,"Being a WWII buff, I saw this documentary on the shelf at my local library and without hesitation picked it up. It was by far the best documentary about the battle of Normandy that I have ever seen. It is narrated by a gentleman who landed on Omah Beach in Normandy back in 1944. So perhaps the viewer will have a better understanding about what it was like to fight there. The documentary has news reel footage, and hand held images caught on film. Most likely from a reporter who landed on the beach with the soldiers. It is told from the American, German, British, Candian and French soldiers point of view. Also from the French civilian's who were their caught up in the fight.  If you pay close attention, you will recieve a great deal of information from the people who faught there. To whom we still owe a great deal of thanks. Superbly written, directed, edited and narrated. This documentary is worth not only your money but time as well. You might never look at the battle the same again. So in the terms of a  excellent documentary very view recieve rave reviews. This one does and should. Also note that it aired on the Discovery Channel on June 6th, 1994 for the 50th Anniversary of the invasion. Grade:A+",982627200,7,1218,4.506787330316742
