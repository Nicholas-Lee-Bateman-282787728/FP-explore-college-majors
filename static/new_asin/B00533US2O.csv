8454968,5,B00533US2O,"Season 3 of this classic western has some of the most entertaining and certianly some of the most comical episodes of the series along with action, romance and fascinating characters.  The DVD is beautifully remastered and episodes very nearly uncut, but as it's a German release, if you're in the US you need a region-free or all-region DVD player to play it and must set the language option to English in the DVD menu to hear the original actors in English.",1330732800,16,459,4.666666666666667
