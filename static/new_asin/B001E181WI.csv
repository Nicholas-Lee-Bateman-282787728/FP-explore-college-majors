There won't be a dry eye in the room when Ms Garrett sings ""Abide with Me"", with a background large screen in black and white of allied soldiers in trenches.  I discovered this DVD, while watching a Boston home TV station, which broadcasts Classic Arts clips every night from 11:30 to 6:30 am.  Every city should subscribe to that source of great works, furnished free to any local station that agrees to run it in segments of at least one hour.  It may show, a scene from a movie, an act from a play, an opera aria, a ballet piece, a pop performance, a clip from early TV shows, and more.",1491091200,,692,4.3
8295984,5,B001E181WI,"Her rendition of ""Abide With Me,"" as WW I photos from the Allied trenches of France were shown on three huge screens behind her on the stage were moving and heart-breaking. That alone is why I bought this DVD and well worth it. I still tear up watching it...",1366761600,2,258,4.285714285714286
8295985,4,B001E181WI,"I purchased this DVD after hearing and seeing Leslie singing ""Abide With Me"" on the Classic Arts channel. What a wonderful performance! I was even more pleased with the show when I got the DVD. Especially the duet of Leslie and Guy Barker doing ""Baby It's Cold Outside."" I never imagined song like that could be done between a singer and a trumpet player but it was so much fun to watch.

This is not the first time I had purchased a DVD after seeing a performance on the Classic Arts channel and looking again for it on Youtube only to discover the performance was removed from Youtube, never to be seen again. What a waste!",1336348800,3,625,4.387931034482759
8295986,5,B001E181WI,"I ordered this DVD a few days before Christmas because my sister mentioned how much she loved ""Abide With Me"" sung by this artist, who I have to admit, I'd never heard of. She had only heard it once on TV. I went right to Amazon, found it, ordered it and never dreamt it would arrive before Christmas. The order said it would arrive before Jan. 10th. Lo and Behold, it arrived two days before Christmas and my sister (who does not own a computer and had no idea things could be found this quickly) was over the moon. I have to admit, it is beautiful. Thank you Amazon!",1326931200,2,568,4.220183486238532
