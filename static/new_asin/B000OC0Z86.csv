This is REAL and revealing and if we were all honest this is how we often feel or think. Transparency is something I appreciate which Joni displayed plus I often need to be reminded just how fortunate I am and how grateful I should be.  It is all ABOUT HIM, Jesus and ALL THAT HE IS in ANY circumstance or situation no matter how trying.  A good dose of reality and truth!",1409702400,,465,4.087912087912088
