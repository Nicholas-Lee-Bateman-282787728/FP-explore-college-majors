8684669,5,B00ORV54C2,"Winx Club Season 1 in Italian has been rereleased again 9 months after the Region 1 English version, mainly to replace the 2010 reprint DVDs that had a common problem. On the 2010 sets the audio tracks are defective, not the discs that played fine (discovered it on Vol. 1) because the video doesn't stutter.

This set fixed everything again, with all 26 episodes from the first season, in all its Italian uncut glory and awesome clarity. I say get this set too, because if you have it on Region 1 or seen it on Netflix, this will be an amazing addition to your Winx Club magical collection!",1437004800,,591,4.472222222222222
