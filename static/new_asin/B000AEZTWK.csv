2388793,5,B000AEZTWK,"This is a fantastic DVD, the first available for studying medieval sword fighting or swordplay. Not only high on production values, but with rock-solid technique as well.

Features some fine scenes of dueling in the Liechtenauer or German style, followed by detailed ""how to"" segments for learning the basic footwork, movements, strikes and ""meisterhau""

A must for any WMA library!",1130716800,15,382,5.35
8078334,5,B000AEZTWK,"This dvd's format is perfect for you and a partner and includes a good amount of knowledge for the aspiring swordsman.
I wish I had this when I was a kid. I would have been all up in that.

Very thorough details for your movements and they instructors angle things to where you can really get the movements down.

There's plenty of room for improvisation after doing this a few times, which is as it should. It makes me want to do more and get better.

I will definitely purchase volume two, along with their Messer instructional dvd.",1386460800,,534,4.428571428571429
8078335,4,B000AEZTWK,This DVD is a a great tool for beginners in the longsword arts of Johannes Liechtenhauer. It displays the fundamental theory and techniques in an easy to understand manner and provides the martial artist with several very good practice drills. Overall a good start.,1379894400,,265,5.045454545454546
8078336,5,B000AEZTWK,"A great introduction to the art of two-handed sword fighting. I'm teaching my sons, and even though my experience is somewhat limited, the explanations have given us enough to practice together. I'm looking forward to getting the other related DVDs from Agilitas.",1360800000,,263,5.285714285714286

8078338,5,B000AEZTWK,"I have been a student of martial arts for many years, and I frequently buy videos to supplement and diversify my training. This is without a doubt one of the best martial arts instructional videos I have ever seen.
This video teaches the fundamentals of German Longsword combat, as well as some intermediate and advanced techniques. There is a lot of information given, but it is presented very clearly and thoroughly, and it never feels rushed. After each technique or principle, you are given a training drill that helps learn it. The drills are excellent and really useful for training both the techniques as well as reaction and decision-making. The demonstrators are both excellent swordsmen, and one can learn a lot by watching them that is not mentioned verbally.
The video covers:

A little bit of history and context for the style

Basic stances, grips and footwork. The four primary stances are taught (vom tag, alber, pflug, and ochs), as well as two secondary stances (schrankhut and langort). It is worth mentioning that you periodically see the demonstrators using guards that they do not teach in the video and make no reference to. This is not a real problem.

Basic cutting and thrusting

The five 'master cuts,' including both offensive and defensive applications of each (oddly, except for the schielhau)

Breaking the various guards with master cuts

Attacking with the point

Defending with the point

Techniques from the 'bind'

Basic grappling

and more

Very few other videos that I've seen left me with with the feeling that I could be competent with the material by practicing the content of the video. There's a lot to learn here, but they make it as easy as possible. The price is unbeatable, too. The instruction in this video would easily still be worth it for twice the price. I can't recommend this video enough.",1316044800,2,1844,4.897106109324759
8078339,5,B000AEZTWK,"Have been studying German Dusack and sword with buckler for the better part of a decade but wanted to get in on some of the two handed fun I had been seeing online in some of the better you tube sites (Mainly Czech but also Arma and a couple German groups). Since I don't live anywhere near a large group of serious swordsmen I started looking online for some beginning instruction in whatever form I could.

While video is no place to try mastering any martial art I was surprised at the level of instruction to be found in this film. It will not make you a GREAT swordsman by any means but it depicts excellent practice forms and partnered drills to instill practical techniques based upon the best known school of German swordsmanship, that of Johannes Liechtenauer, founder of the school that developed into just about everything in German fencing that came after him. This dvd is an excellent inroad to the world of historical longsword fencing.",1313452800,,950,4.654761904761905
8078340,5,B000AEZTWK,"I'm a novice to swordsmanship, so far all I have learnt is from other DVD's about saber, cutlass, machete, katana & now longsword fencing.
This DVD was among the best of them all. Highly recommended!
It goes through all the guards, the 5 mastercuts, basic strikes, basic thrusts, footwork, and more.
All the way it is very well explained, and set up in an easy to follow way.
After viewing the DVD you know so much about longsword fencing you only need to train and spar to get good.
It is very well set up, and has 4 chapters, the mastercuts are in chapter 3 and chapter 4 is just advanced techniques.

Not only does the DVD go though very much, it does so in a very pedagogic manner. It contains lots of excercises you must perform, most of them with a partner, but very much can be achieved by doing this in front of a mirror alone.
If you're intrested in learning the longsword, this is a must have.
If your allready practicing longsword fencing, chances are good this DVD has something new for you as well.
And if your practicing some other form of fencing like kendo, then this DVD can peak your interest in a new swordstyle,
and I think even some of the moves can be employed with a katana as well.

I want vol. 2! This is a tremendous DVD, the guys who made it have based this on lots of research, and managed not only to bring the western swordfighting alive, they have made it easy to learn for any willing student of the sword as well.",1265846400,2,1446,4.293040293040293
8078341,5,B000AEZTWK,"This is an outstanding work on the Western Fighting Style of the Longsword. Not only do you get a background into the book and historic setting, you get a look into how the makers recreated the steps, guards and attacks. There is enough to keep you busy for a long long time.

The four chapters on the video cover the History, The Basics, and Advanced techniques with complete walk throughs of all. The fight sequences are done in slow, medium and fast from multiple angles to let you see footwork and hand placement.

Highly reccomended for anyone intrested in Western Martial Arts- awaiting for Volume 2.",1262908800,4,606,4.7075471698113205
8078342,5,B000AEZTWK,"The video is simply without peer.  And you'll want a ""Liechtenauer"", or a ""Meyer"" from Albion Swords.",1199577600,4,101,4.9411764705882355
8078343,5,B000AEZTWK,"I've seen alot of martial arts videos and DVDs. Most are just not worth the money! This exellent exeption, teaching the history and practice of the 15th century german longsword, is a must for all western sword-play enthusiasts.

 Note: The practice swords in the video are mostly Valentine Armouries' 2-hand aluminum trainers. To pursue YOUR training, you will probably  need: 1- a good partner 2- fencing masks 3- hockey gloves  4- two training longswords, perhaps the ""Practical"" (blunt) longswords by Hanwei, or the aluminum trainers by Valentine Armouries or Swordcrafts.com",1141430400,10,579,5.4
