8400349,5,B003M9ZA4M,"I watched both the movie and the TV series. I find both good. The TV series picks up where the movie left off. This is not the complete season but the first 12 episodes. Like all TV series, there are some changes from the movie but nothing too drastic. My 4 year old boy loves this and I watch it with him. This is one of the kids shows that adults can sit through and get some enjoyment.",1363392000,,388,3.9871794871794872
8400350,4,B003M9ZA4M,"Based on the movie ""Casper's Scare School"", the series ""Casper's Scare School"" is just as entertaining as the movie.  Yes, the new adventures of Casper the Friendly Ghost continue as he attends a special educational facility for young monsters who need to scare humans the right way.  Of course, being a friendly ghost, Casper has friends both human and monster as long as he keeps it a secret.

This DVD has the first 12 individual episodes as seen on Cartoon Network including ""Accidental Hero"", ""Bully For You"", ""Fang Decay"", ""Opposite Day"", ""Rich Kid Ra"", and ""Weekend at Bunny's"".  And don't forget that new episodes are being shown as of this post on the Cartoon Network.",1350691200,2,677,4.860869565217391
8400351,1,B003M9ZA4M,"These short movies look beautiful and more modern than the original ones produced in the 1950s. However, the old ones are much funnier and more touching.

This DVD contains 12 episodes. They are: Accidental Hero, Bully For You, Disarmed and Dangerous, Dragon Quest, Fang Decay, Frankenleftovers, Grimly Day, Opposite Day, Ra-minator, Rich Kid Ra, Scare Day, Weekend at Bunny's.

In short, this DVD is worth borrowing but not purchasing.

I own the old Casper movies on 4 DVDs. They are titled Best of Casper vol. 1, Best of Casper vol. 2, Casper and Wendy - Scare Up Some Fun, Casper Trick Or Treat. Each contains 12 episodes. The have brought me countless humorous times and warm feeling.",1341446400,2,689,4.871794871794871
8400352,3,B003M9ZA4M,This was listed as Season 1 of the show.  It isn't.  It's just the first 12 episodes of the show & is shown in order.,1282780800,,117,3.64
8400353,4,B003M9ZA4M,While there are some episodes I'd love to see on this DVD the 12 episodes are among the best of the series. The show is far better than the movie it is based on. First vampire bully Thatch has a cavity and has to be convince to seek aid from a human dentist by Casper. Then zombie rights Mantha wants to prove how good Zombies are by winning Scare Day. This is followed by another Mantha episode where she's having trouble with her limbs but her new choices are even more trouble than their worth. Casper scares a building full of people by mistake and suddenly everyone in school is afraid him. Thatch and Casper are a team on do not laugh grim day but Casper isn't the problem when Thatch is the one with the giggle fits. When Wolfie studies the full moon powers everyone at school reverses personalities. The evil teachers show they have a soft side when his pet bunny gets loose. When everyone learn that Ra is a rich kid his kindness is taken advantage of.  When Ra learns how cool he is when Casper possesses him his coolness goes to his head. the two so so episodes on the DVD are the ones which Casper experiment to bring food to life like Frankenstein monster doesn't work as planned and when teacher Mr. Burns feels like he not the dragon he should be decide to take on a medieval theme restraunt.,1282694400,3,1307,4.33469387755102
