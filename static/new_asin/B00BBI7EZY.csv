The first movie with Rathbone is AWFUL.  Sound not good at all.  Have to turn way up to hear most, then when regular audio is operating, it almost blows you out of the house!  NOT recommended for purchase.  In fact, I want my money back.  So many Vance\s one can hardly keep straight.  Last movie, Calling Philo Vance"" (with James Stephenson) is a repeat of Wm Powell, (Kennel Murder Case --good, only one worth it's salt!) ,second, movie.  Only difference is instead of butler, woman is involved, and instead of country of China's antique ceramics, it is airplane plans.  The other Dragon case with Warren WM is okay, but not great, and the Garden Murder Case with E. Lowe is mediocre. For $30.80, it is insane. Actually was $35.48 appx and I used some points.

5570391,4,B00BBI7EZY,"Bishop Murder Case, The

Stilted, verging on humorous, acting in this early talkie murder mystery. (A good example of silent film actors struggling to adapt to talking pictures.) Basil Rathbone, as Philo Vance, at least gets practice for his Sherlock Holmes character. If you're looking for another old mystery to watch and have run out of other options, give this a view. Otherwise, you have many better choices.

Kennel Murder Case, The

This is the best of the Philo Vance series. It serves as a good introduction to the series, and if you want to get a good feel for the nature of these whodunits, choose this film first. William Powell, among the many actors who portray the detective, also does the best jobthe most authentic, the most charismatic, and the most comfortable. And Mary Astorshes good in everything shes in. Cant go wrong with this gem.

Dragon Murder Case, The

Engaging, entertaining murder mystery from the early 30s starring Warren William as Philo Vance. (You even get early underwater photography in this film.) Acting is good all around in this mystery. Witty dialogue and ongoing suspense make this whodunit worth watching.

Casino Murder Case, The

Paul Lukas plays Philo Vance in this typical 30s whodunit but doesnt have the charisma of the other actors who play this character. Humorous bits play out in this entry in the Vance series, in fact its interesting that Vance fights with his manservant in a fashion similar to the sport Clouseau has with his servant, Cato, in the Pink Panther series. Even though, this entry is not as interesting as the others in the Vance series. Worth a look if you're out of other options.

Garden Murder Case, The

Edmund Lowe stars as a subpar Philo Vance in this very average episode in the Philo Vance series. Formulaic and predictable. View if you really want to see all the movies in the series.

Calling Philo Vance

James Stephenson plays Philo Vance and is arrested in Vienna by Nazis. This provides foreign intrigue, but most action takes place in America in this better-than-average Vance whodunit. This is a remake of The Kennel Murder Case. Good mystery and worth watching.",1466467200,4,2151,4.865753424657535

5570395,4,B00BBI7EZY,"Overall, I was pleased with this set.  Each of the six films features a different actor in the title role and it was interesting to see how each ""star"" interpreted the character.  William Powell was far and away the best at portraying Philo Vance---Powell is the actor most associated with the role, having played the character more  times than any other actor.  IMO, Paul Lukas was the weakest of the six actors in this set---his heavy accent simply does not ""fit"" the urbane, sophisticated Philo Vance.  The quality of the transfers was good, as was the sound.  It should be noted that, ""Calling Philo Vance"" is a remake of, ""The Kennel Murder Case"", and it suffers in comparison.

This is a nice little set of movies---each viewer will form his/her own opinions about the  various actors and how well/poorly they come across as Vance.  For those of us who enjoy these kinds of ""B"" mystery films, this collection should satisfy!",1463702400,5,930,4.7625
5570396,4,B00BBI7EZY,"""The Kennel Murder Case"" with William Powell and ""The Dragon Murder Case"" with William Warren are the two best Philo Vance films and definitely worth seeing, good to see them both included.  Unfortunately, this collection is missing 3 of the earlier William Powell movies:  ""The Canary Murder Case"" (1929), ""The Greene Murder Case"" (1929) and ""The Benson Murder Case"" (1930).  Being a big fan of the interplay between William Powell's Philo Vance and Eugene Pallette's Sgt. Heath, I see this as a glaring omission.  The Basil Rathbone film is for the completest only.",1461628800,,567,5.064516129032258

5570415,5,B00BBI7EZY,"Philo Vance was the first private detective of the sound era.
Eight actors played Philo Vance in thirteen films between 1929 and 1947.
Four were produced by Paramount, three by Warner Brothers, three by MGM, and three by PRC (Producer's Releasing Corporation).

All thirteen Philo Vance movies are available in two different boxes.
There is no overlap.
The Warner Archive box, listed on this page, has the three films produced by Warner Brothers, plus three by MGM.
The  OnesMedia box has the four Paramount films, plus three B-Movies from PRC:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PHILO-VANCE-FILM-RARITIES-COLLECTION-7-DVD-R-7-MOVIES/dp/B00ZX4XVH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PHILO VANCE FILM RARITIES COLLECTION - 7 DVD-R - 7 MOVIES</a>

The great William Powell was the first actor to play Philo Vance.
He played Vance in four different films.
The OnesMedia collection has the first three - the Warner box has just his final appearance in the role:

- 1929: THE CANARY MURDER CASE (Paramount - OnesMedia box)
- 1929: THE GREENE MURDER CASE (Paramount - OnesMedia box)
- 1930: THE BENSON MURDER CASE (Paramount - OnesMedia box)
- 1933: THE KENNEL MURDER CASE (Warner Bros. - Warner Archive box)

The first three are extremely difficult to find.
This is their only listing on Amazon.
These are not great films, but they are historically important.
The CANARY MURDER CASE started out as a silent film in 1928, but Paramount decided to re-shoot several scenes with sound, and to dub sound onto existing footage.

Silent movie legend Louise Brooks is the murder victim in THE CANARY MURDER CASE.
She was in Germany making silent films when Paramount cabled her to return to Hollywood to dub her scenes with sound.
She refused.
Her voice was dubbed by a different actress and Louise Brooks' Hollywood career was over.

In addition to these three early William Powell films, the OnesMedia box also has

- 1939: Warren William in THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE (Paramount - OnesMedia box)
- 1947: William Wright in PHILO VANCE RETURNS (P.R.C. - OnesMedia box)
- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE (P.R.C. - OnesMedia box)
- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION (P.R.C. - OnesMedia box)

Warren William is underrated in his performance as Philo Vance in the Dragon Murder case. The remaining stories suffer in comparison.

But the other three actors were rather tepid as Philo Vance.  I will probably watch only two of the movies with any regularity, the ones that featured Basil Rathbone and William Powell.  The William Powell ""Kennel Murder Case"" Is a Classic that almost makes up for the other three quite tepid Philo Vance mysteries.  There was the same movie in the set twice (The Kennel Murder Case) as well with different actors placing Philo Vance.  The ads did not quite lie.  But they did not tell all of the truth either.

5570447,3,B00BBI7EZY,"Following upon the essay-review preceding  me, comments on the plots and nature of the films is irrelevant. Suffice to say, when I first read S.S. Van Dine. ( Willard Huntington Wright) his popularity was fading but he was still a contender, when I last read him, it was due to the happy fact that Kindle made possible purchase at a very modest price. Dimming memory suggests that I enjoyed them greatly early on, recent memory that I still find them appealing.
As to the films, no doubt I saw  most of these in the era of Saturday matinees (starting at some early morning hour I cannot recall) for children, at a price of about 11 cents. The program always included an A feature film, a B subsidiary film, coming attractions, news of the day, and, of course, some short subjects. The theaters were always packed with the kids, reacting as kids will, when in the dark, with only the restraining voice of ushers and usherettes with flashlights.
So, I have no idea how this selection of twenties and thirties films, plus a couple of later ones, will strike a younger person. William Powell, of course, is the star turn. The interest is seeing him as he begins to develop the speaking character (as opposed to his silent film parts) that evolved into The Thin Man and a number of other  humorous mysteries which are still part of film lore. Rathbone came as a pleasant surprise while Warren William demonstrates why he was one of the Kings of the B film, playing in a goodly number of series as Vance, Perry Mason, and others.( I have no idea why he fell out of favor as an A picture co-star or feature player). Lowe and Lukas I liked to see for old times sake.
For those who get a pleasure watching primitive early talkie technique, the work of later or soon to fade Stars, the translation of book to screen, revival of old memories and the like, this is an appealing package; others may have a problem seeing why most of these were brought back from the graveyard.
I cannot judge for others whether the price is a fair one in terms of the benefits the buyer will  reap in watching the set.",1409875200,2,2088,4.47244094488189

I particularly enjoy the performances of William Powell as Philo Vance and also (in other movies) as Nick Charles (in the Thin Man series) and in other detective movies such as the Ex-Mrs Bradford and the Star at Midnight.  Powell's performances in all of these detective movies includes a good blend of humor and mystery and he basically plays the same character in all of them.  None of these films are Academy Award winners but they are entertaining and enjoyable.  I purchased this anthology because of William Powell's performance in The Kennel Murder Case.  There are five other Philo Vance movies featuring other actors playing the Vance character (Warren WIlliam, Paul Lukas, etc.).  They aren't as well written as the vehicle written for Powell but if you like this type of movie genre, the DVD is worth a look.",1396656000,5,877,4.774834437086093

This collection contains several different stories and a few different actors taking the title role. All are good, but each one has a slightly different interpretation of the character. The dapper Philo Vance is always proper, gentlemanly, and perfectly groomed. Definitely different than the private detectives seen on American television or the Sam Spade/Mike Hammer characters. These are films that will challenge your ability to pick up on clues and arrive at the correct answer before the famous Philo Vance. Your family will be fascinated, too, and can safely watch these films because there's no bad language, adult situations, or obvious violence. Have a classic movie some Sunday afternoon.

If someone has never seen these movies, however, they are still fun B-movies. One strength in the collection is that viewers can see how different directors and actors interpreted the part. The final film in the collection, ""Calling Philo Vance,"" re-works the ""Kennel Murder Case"" from the viewpoint of pre-WWII spying. It starts in Vienna (Hollywood's version) and treats Vance and his team as secret service operatives. The use of foreign languages, especially German and Italian, is cleverly done--we see telegrams and newspaper clippings in the original and then the camera shot segues to the English translation.",1393459200,,875,4.993150684931507

If you are a William Powell fan this set may be worth the $22. The last film CALLING PHILO VANCE, released in 1940 with British actor John Stepenson, follows the same plot, but without the dog show and with pre-WWII espionage involving a secret bomber in place of the Chinese art in the earlier film. It is without the star power of the first KENNEL MURDER CASE, and would  be mildly entertaining if you didn't know the outcome of the original film.

5570484,5,B00BBI7EZY,"Most Warner Archive DVD-Rs I've run into have no trouble playing in various computer DVD drives, whether they have burn capabilities or not. I watch most of my DVDs on the go - on various computers. My copy of Philo Vance Disc 2 - 'The Dragon Murder Case' and 'The Casino Murder Case' requires a drive that is playback-only or the disc will not be recognized at all. I would think this restriction will be carried on to some set-top players that read discs similarly. The Warner Archive, in this case, utilizes a Content Scramble System - Managed Recording when it is burned from Warner Archive. In effect, Warner does not feel confident enough that this title should be marketed as a mass release, but simultaneously feel it necessary to limit the playback options of the consumer who pays extra to acquire the title on a DVD-R. DVD-Rs have long been deemed inferior to manufactured DVDs and, depending on the dye quality of the disc, how the layers have been sandwiched together, and how it is stored, may have a much lower shelf life than DVD. This may mean the consumer will eventually wish to make a digital copy (as Wal-Mart offers) or make a back-up DVD-R of the movie they have paid for. CSS-MR prevents this as well. Unlike regular CSS, CSS-MR is added during the burning of the DVD-R itself, not within the composed structure of the DVD, thus causing problems with drives recognizing the disc. Of around 25 discs I've bought from Warner Archive, only this one and 'The Hanging Tree' utilize the CSS-MR encoding. Based on posts elsewhere on the web, I'm led to believe the George Sanders Saint set and the 80s movie 'If Looks Could Kill' are also scrambled. Based on Warner Archive's on-demand status, making a list of CSS-MR Warner Archive titles may be difficult as this system may well be utilized across titles at random. This means the 2nd disc of the copies you bought of Philo Vance may not be scrambled while mine has been.  Likewise, the fact that only the 2nd disc is scrambled and not all three would suggest a random nature in deciding what discs are given the CSS-MR treatment.  Perhaps someone working at (or has formerly worked) at Warner Archive can shed some light on their various policies?",1371945600,4,2217,4.667519181585678

THE BISHOP MURDER CASE (1930) ***
I give this three stars mainly for its historic interest as a bridge between the silent and sound eras.  I'll disagree slightly with Mr. McCarthy's assessment of the acting in this being ""amateur theater"" and say that it rather shows the actors struggling to get away from silent movie-style acting and into a more natural, fluid style.  Roland Young is the best actor in the lot -- even better than Basil Rathbone here -- and everyone aside from Young and Rathbone remain constrained by silent movie histrionics.  For that latter reason alone, this entry is worth seeing, even if the story itself is rather dull.  Still, it's fun to see the actors struggle to speak into the microphones (reminiscent of the scene from ""Singing in the Rain"").

THE KENNEL MURDER CASE (1933) ****
William Powell and a clever story boost this film into the four star range.

THE DRAGON MURDER CASE (1934) *** 1/2
Warren William is good and Eugene Pallette is always a pleasure to watch.  The plot is just okay, but not unenjoyable.

THE CASINO MURDER CASE (1935) *** 1/2
Paul Lukas is good in this, though his Hungarian accent is rather disconcerting as he portrays this go-around's Vance.  The plot is serviceable.

THE GARDEN MURDER CASE (1936) ** 1/2
Edmund Lowe is fine, but the plot is overlong, dull, and rather preposterous, with an especially unconvincing climax.

CALLING PHILO VANCE (1940) *** 1/2
James Stephenson does capable work here and its fun to see another take on ""The Kennel Murder Case"" plot.",1364601600,70,1729,4.843537414965986

5570507,4,B00BBI7EZY,"Based on best-selling author S.S. Van Dine's stylish and clever sleuth in the early 1900s, Philo Vance was brought to talkies six times in the 1930s - three productions each by Warner Bros. and MGM. The earliest effort in this six-pack stars Basil Rathbone in ""The Bishop Murder Case."" Next, William Powell is Vance in ""The Kennel Murder Case."" Warren William has the role in ""The Dragon Murder Case"" with Paul Lukas taking a crack at it in ""The Casino Murder Case."" Edmund Lowe is Vance in the fifth outing, ""The Garden Murder Case"" and James Stephenson stars in the last, ""Calling Philo Vance."" Six popular era actors with very different styles; the rigid Rathbone, whimsical Powell, humorous William, stodgy European Lukas, tongue-in-cheek Lowe and the intense Stephenson
  Typical of MGM productions in 1930-31, ""Bishop"" looks like a filmed stage play; the scenes played out full length in rooms with ceilings 30-feet high. The acting is over the top by today's standards, but the mystery is intriguing. ""Kennel"" from WB is the strongest entry with an excellent performance by Powell. Some of the wry humor he would mine to greater glory in ""The Thin Man"" series is evident as he goes about solving this locked-room mystery. The supporting cast is first rate. Eugene Pallette, the rotund, foghorn voiced character actor of that era provides comic relief as the dense police sergeant here and returns in the role with William in ""Dragon."" This entry features a very unusual plot - a much hated man disappears in the swimming pool on a private estate and is later discovered in a quarry far from the pool. And there may be a dragon who dunnit! Lots of red herring suspects for Vance to wade through here The most convoluted plot comes in ""Casino"" from MGM with Lukas as Vance and a young Rosalind Russell as a suspect/leading lady. At the time Ted Healy was a studio contract player. Healy was a vaudeville performer who created The Stooges: Moe and Shemp Howard and Larry Fine. By all accounts He was a vicious boozer and died a victim of a lethal beating. Why anyone thought then or now why he was a comic is a bigger mystery than the one in this film. Also from MGM, Lowe plays Vance lighter than the others in ""Garden."" In this one depressed people mutter they must die - and they do. Nat Pendleton, another brutish actor on the MGM payroll, supports as the sergeant trying to nail the sinister killer.""Calling Philo Vance"" is a reworking of ""Kennel"" with the hated first victim an airplane designer selling designs to foreign enemies during WW2, instead of a collector of stolen artifacts and pedigreed show dogs. Stephenson as Vance has become a government agent tracking plane designs from Europe back to the USA. He still must solve a locked-bedroom and closet mystery to nail the culprit.
  Outside of ""The Kennel Murder Case"" - sold cheaply in unrestored condition - none of the other five are currently available outside of this Warner Archive collection. These are DVD-R produced on-demand discs.
  I gave the collection four stars because I like those early sound-era mysteries with all their layered plots, and to study the production values various studios employed. Also to study screenwriting, directing and acting styles from that era as compared to today. These six films, remastered to restore crisp lighting, photography and sound, are as silvery as first projected 70-years ago.",1362960000,31,3402,4.877162629757786

Movies</a>&nbsp;collection comes the PHILO VANCE MURDER CASE MYSTERIES COLLECTION.  During the '20s and '30s, the undisputed leading light of popular American detective fiction was S.S. Van Dine's Philo Vance. The brilliant and often overweening Manhattan sophisticate appeared in a dozen best-selling adventures that became coveted properties for the Hollywood studios, as Paramount, Warner and M.G.M.. jockeyed for the rights. The six black & white films (on three discs) spanning the decade from 1930 to 1940 feature a variety of Vance portrayals, and a variety of styles along with a variety of film conditions.  In my summaries I try not to give away the plots, but there are some minor spoilers, so use your own judgement. Let's investigate......

The first selection, THE BISHOP MURDER CASE (1930) from M.G.M. stars a dapper pencil mustached Basil Rathbone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes</a>) as the titular detective.  The only other ""names"" in the film are Roland Young (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RUGGLES-OF-RED-GAP/dp/B0033PSH7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RUGGLES OF RED GAP</a>, TOPPER) and Leila Hyams (FREAKS,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ISLAND-OF-LOST-SOULS/dp/B005D0RDKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ISLAND OF LOST SOULS</a>, RUGGLES OF RED GAP).  The print quality is watchable, but suffers from speckling, damage and a constantly crackling soundtrack.  Like many movies of the early sound era it seems framed more like a stage play, probably due to the limitations of the early sound equipment. Rathbone hues closely to S. S. Van Dine's descriptions in the original novels, a brilliant dilettante dandy, only with the moustache replacing the monocle. There's a great scene near the beginning where we see Vance having breakfast on his Art Deco balcony, sitting in his Art Deco chair at his Art Deco table.  The supporting cast reminds one of a amateur theatre production, stiff delivery, over-acting and all.  Even the leads flub a line or two, I guess there was no money in the budget for re-takes!  The case revolves around a number of murders inspired by nursery rhymes (the first victim's name is actually ""Cock"" Robin!), committed by a murderer calling himself ""The Bishop.""  All the usual characters abound, the old woman who knows more than she lets on, her nervous hunchbacked brother, the old professor with a pretty niece and her fiance, etc., etc.  Really creaky, but worth it to see a young Basil Rathbone at the start of his career, and for all those great wool suits......

Next up is THE KENNEL MURDER CASE (1933), a Warner Bros. release starring the ALWAYS dapper William Powell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-THIN-MAN-SERIES/dp/B0009GX1C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE THIN MAN SERIES</a>, MY MAN GODFREY, MR. ROBERTS) on his third go-round, having already portrayed Vance in two films for Paramount, THE GREENE MURDER CASE (1929) and THE BENSON MURDER CASE (1930).  Co-starring are Mary Astor (THE MALTESE FALCON, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), and Eugene Pallette (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, THE MARK OF ZORRO) on HIS third appearance as police Detective Sgt. Heath.  The film was also directed by the great Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE, WHITE CHRISTMAS) whose touch elevates this entry greatly. Look for a great traveling crane shot near the end. The plot concerns one of those door-locked-from-the-inside murders of a miserly rich guy that everyone wants to kill.  A second murder is also discovered. There's no shortage of suspects, the niece ""under his thumb,"" her lover who thinks the victim may have killed his dog, the ex-con butler, his shifty personal secretary, the two-timing girlfriend (in a dress with fringed shoulders that you have to see to believe),her lover who also has a motive, and the wronged Chinese cook.  Vance owns a scotch terrier, Captain MacTavish, and there's a scene with a dog that could be Asta.  The movie has a few slyly humorous scenes, especially those involving the grumpy coroner played by actor Etienne Girardot, who repeats the role twice more later in the series.  The picture quality is a tad better, with good contrast, but still full of speckles and scratches.  Thankfully the sound is fine and strong, as is this entry in the series......

My fave, Warren William (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LADY-FOR-A-DAY/dp/B006QS9M1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LADY FOR A DAY</a>, THE WOLF MAN) portrays the sleuth in 1934's THE DRAGON MURDER CASE, this time a First National entry.  Besides the retuning Pallette and Giradot, the cast includes Margaret Lindsey (THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES, THE ELLERY QUEEN SERIES), Lyle Talbot (GO WEST YOUNG MAN, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE), Robert McWade on his second go-round as D.A. Markham and Etienne Girardot returning as Coroner Doremus.  The dragon of the title is actually a ""dragon pool,"" a deep, dark pool that is rumored to be home to a water monster.  During a party, three guests go for a swim and, you've guessed it, our victim, again not very well-liked, doesn't come back up.  The pool is later drained but no body is found, just the tracks of a three toed creature!  Of course Vance, D.A. Markham and Sgt. Heath know better, and try to winnow down the suspect pool (sorry!) after another guest is found dead.  The shady group this time includes a reluctant fiance in love with someone else (are there any other kind in these movies?), her true love, her drunk brother, her ""mental case"" mother, the victims's old flame, and the prerequisite butler.  The picture and sound are similar to the previous entry. William played Vance one more time, in 1939's you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gracie-Allen-Murder-Case/dp/B000MVYQJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gracie Allen Murder Case</a>.  He was born to play these debonair roles, having just finished his first appearance of four as Perry Mason, he would go on to play Michael Laynard ""The Lone Wolf"" in seven pictures for Columbia between 1939 and 1943.  Three are available on DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lone-Wolf-Meets-A-Lady/dp/B007G8SEPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lone Wolf Meets A Lady</a>&nbsp;(1940),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Counter-Espionage/dp/B005DL6PDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Counter-Espionage</a>&nbsp;(1942) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passport-To-Suez/dp/B005DL6PO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passport To Suez</a>&nbsp;(1943).  Warren William passed away of cancer in 1948 at the young age of 53.  Fortunately his films are being re-discoverd and re-released, and you can catch many on T.C.M. from time to time......

Our fourth entry, from M.G.M. is THE CASINO MURDER CASE, a faithful adaptation from 1935 with Paul Lukas (DODSWORTH, THE LADY VANISHES) as Vance.  His co-stars included Rosalind Russell (THE WOMEN, HIS GIRL FRIDAY), Eric Blore (SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE LONE WOLF SERIES) as Vance's butler, THREE STOOGES discoverer Ted Healy (MAD LOVE, SAN FRANCISCO) as Sgt. Heath, and in smaller roles; William Demerest (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, MY THREE SONS) as an auctioneer and Leo (G.) Carroll (SPELLBOUND, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E) as a butler.  Charles Sellon takes over the role of Dr. Doremus the coroner. The picture quality is similar to the last two, and the soundtrack, directed by Douglas Shearer is great. The plot revolves around anonymous notes sent to Vance warning him about future murders.  The first victim-to-be is familiar to Vance, so he uses a ruse to visit the subject's home and finds the family arguing; the subject's there with his estranged wife, his wealthy mother, the butler and mother's secretary (Russell), who takes a liking to the cultured Vance.  The feeling is mutual so he invites her out, but first takes her to see the D.A. and shows her the note.  She's able to tell them where it was typed, so Vance and Sgt. Heath start to investigate.  Even though warned, the victim goes to his uncle's casino and collapses after taking a drink.  At the same time the secretary informs Vance that the victim's wife has also died at the mansion.  The resulting investigation has it all, family secrets, changed wills, books on poison, false confessions, decoys, more secrets and even another murder.  As you might gather, the plot is more dense and complicated than the former entries.  The cast does a good job and the director keeps the action and plots moving. Paul Lukas makes for a different take on Vance, but his  manner and soothing Hungarian accent fits the character like a glove......

The fifth tale is M.G.M.'s THE GARDEN MURDER CASE from 1936. This time Vance is portrayed by Edmund Lowe (WHAT PRICE GLORY, DINNER AT EIGHT) along with Virginia Bruce (JANE EYRE, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD), Gene Lockhart (MEET JOHN DOE, HANGMEN ALSO DIE!), Grant Mitchell (MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER) as Markham, and the great Nat Pendleton (PENTHOUSE, BUCK PRIVATES) as the preening Sgt. Heath, providing comic relief from time to time. Etienne Girardot makes his third and last appearance as meal-deprived coroner Dr. Doremus. For the first time a trailer's included, and it's overall condition is better than the feature, but the film's picture, after a rough beginning, improves greatly and is the best transfer yet compared to the other entries (but that's not saying much). In this entry, Vance joins a millionaire and his guests in his box at a steeplechase race for ""gentlemen"" riders. Also attending are his estranged ward who's also his niece, an older Major with his younger wife and the rich man's friend, who's about to race.  The amateur jockey seems to be in a trance, and when the Major's wife implores him not to race he can only answer that he's going ""to fall, break my neck.""  As any mystery fan could guess, this is exactly what happens. It's initially considered a suicide, but Vance has his doubts.  At a party at the millionaire's house the next day, Vance finds out about all the rattling family skeletons.  The millionaire's niece hates him because he and her grandmother are trying to break up her romance with a young man by offering him a job far, far away, which he accepted, putting a strain on THEIR relationship.  Mr. Moneybags was also ""having it off"" with his mother's nurse, but has dumped her, which will result in deportation to her native country, England. This understandably has put her in a bind.  There are also rumors about the dead jockey's affair with (  ). But a shot and a scream are heard that night, and our rich friend is found dead.  And that's just the start of the fun!  Lowe's performance as Vance is more contemporary and this time his dog is a dachshund. As the series progresses, the portrayals of Vance and his mannerisms get farther and farther away from the novel's descriptions......

Our final program is Warner Bros./First National's CALLING PHILO VANCE from 1940. This time British-born James Stephenson (KING OF THE UNDERWORLD, THE LETTER) answers the call for Vance.  His co-stars included Margot Stevenson (INVISIBLE STRIPES, RABBIT RUN), Edward Brophy (FREAKS, MAD LOVE), Henry O'Neill (WELLS FARGO, WHITE CARGO) as D.A. Markham, Jimmy Conlon (a Preston Sturges regular) as Coroner Doremus, and look quick for George Reeves (GONE WITH THE WIND, SUPERMAN). CALLING PHILO VANCE was adapted from THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, and is almost a scene by scene remake of the superior earlier picture, but still has it's own charms.  Set during the beginning of World War II, the dog show introduction of the earlier film is replaced with a prologue showing Vance trying to retrieve a set of airplane blueprints Vienna.  The government suspects that prominent airplane manufacturer Archer Coe sold them to the enemy, but Vance unfortunately loses the proof. After some excitement we are back in the U.S., when Vance and Markham, who now works for the Secret Service, receive news about Coe's murder.  From there on the plot development matches the previous movie so closely that I can't believe it was written by different people. Stephenson (who was a Best Supporting Actor nominee for THE LETTER), with his debonair British accent and urbane wit, is a breath of fresh air portraying a somewhat more traditional Vance. Heath is now called Ryan, but the characters are interchangeable. Coroner Doremus and Captain MacTavish are also back, with the scottie almost stealing the picture.  The pacing is faster than KENNEL which moves it along nicely, but the denouement feels rushed. A trailer is included, but the picture quality of both are a step down from the previous film......

The movies weren't done with Vance yet, 1947 saw three more pictures released, PHILO VANCE RETURNS starring William Wright, PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE, and PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION, both with Alan Curtis. All were from ""Poverty Row"" studios PRC and Eagle-Lion, and their plots and portrayal of Vance bore little resemblance to the character of the novels.",1362528000,140,13619,5.579330422125182

8565430,5,B00BBI7EZY,"GREAT Movies. Sadly the 3 DVDs are BURNED on old-fashioned dye type media.

I understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid $2 more for M-Disc, a burnable disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  The video and audio quality is excellent on the disc.

These are great murder mysteries. If you like Sherlock Holmes you will love these movies also. Many of them featured dogs in a prominent way. The dogs at humor at appropriate moments. I wish Hollywood still knew how to make these kinds of great movies.
In one of the movies you will see the dog Toto from The Wizard of Oz fame.
