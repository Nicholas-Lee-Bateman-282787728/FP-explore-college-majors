6196014,2,B00HQ24A0Q,"All but one of the films was in very poor condition - dirt, grain, flickering - only The Kid was viewable. I don't know whether that was because the film was stored in better conditions, or it was digitally scanned and restored frame-by-frame, but The Kid is worthwhile.

My favorite Chaplin films are The Gold Rush, City Lights, and Modern Times.",1465084800,5,347,4.688524590163935
