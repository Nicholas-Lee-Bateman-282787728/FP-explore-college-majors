2465335,5,B000CIWXT6,"While the libretto is highly comical - sometimes hilariously over-the-moon, Mozart plunges into the depths of each character - developing them into far more than 18th century stereotypes: their motivations and reasons fully believable - even in this fantastically theatrical comedic opera.

The score is one of Mozart's technically most challenging offering great chunks of through-composed music linking one idea to another in unbroken chains in almost Wagnerian style. The young Mozart was clearly a genius, but an untempered one - throwing his entire arsenal of creativity into his first ""mature"" opera, a work of great musical difficulty.  He delivered the work to Munich for a mid December premiere, but an additional 3 weeks of rehearsals were needed before it's January 13th premiere.

The jewel that is the 400 seat Drottningholm Palace Theatre still employs the original 1766 stage machinery - fully intact - (thunder and wave machines, flying chairs, etc.) often used in its productions, the orchestra plays original instruments, wears wigs and dresses in the time period, allowing presentations of as close to a total recreation of 18th century opera as we're likely to see anywhere these days.

Goran Jarvefelt creates a production that feels as if it traveled through time directly from Mozart to us. His use (as well as most of the productions I've seen from here) of the tiny Drottningholm stage is a textbook lesson in the creative use of limited space to its fullest possibilities. He moves us swiftly through courtyards, bed chambers, workrooms, parlours, a wild forest, and a garden/glade. This is managed by allowing every singer to begin their bravura arias in the proper locale, then dropping the curtain as the character continues on the apron while the carpenters and stagehands quickly strike and reset the stage, sometimes partially visible through a small hole in the curtain! The characters, more often than now, acknowledge the audience, sometimes bow, or as in the case of the Count and Violante, wave an enthusiastic good-bye at the delighted crowd. The ends of Acts I and II find the entire company before the curtain, each bowing in character, adding immeasurably to the charm and sense of good fun.

Though its comedic aspects are never diminished, Mozart takes the darker moments of the characters - and creates scenes that plum the depths of despair and madness as powerfully as if they'd been lifted from a more tragic opera seria. The balancing act between dark and light here is at a level comparable to, say, Don Giovanni. Here, we can find Mozart's passion for taking something that starts out like an aria, then morphs into a duet, then a quartet, then an ensemble employing all 7 roles of the opera. That he achieves this with the skill of someone far greater in years and experience than he, only adds to the ""genius"" factor. It's remarkable, really.

Richard Croft nut that I am, I was pleased to see the then almost impossibly youthful tenor garner the lion's share of applause (his bravura scene in Act II elicits the only chorus of bravos), but this is first and foremost, as with all of Mozart's great works, an ensemble piece, every character part of the puzzle and fully integrated into a brilliant whole.

Croft looks wonderfully silly as the foppish, spoiled young count, ridiculous wig and overdone make-up and all. Later he appears more ""natural,"" but always a little ""girly"" or ""fey"" - which he works to his character's advantage. Whether hopping from chair-to-chair with ridiculous speed, doing sommersaults, jumping atop tables or crawling under beds, he's lean and lithe and comes across fully inside the head of this young man. His scenes of madness begin comically, but then reach a level of pathos that, while not actually heartbreaking (this is a comedy!) are infinitely touching. He dispatches his difficult music with great elasticity, though sometimes his quick vibrato develops a rapid bleat some will find unattractive, but for me, suits this type of role beautifully.

Britt-Marie Aruhn as the title role - disguised as ""the Pretend Gardener"" offers sheer delight and, like Croft, goes from silliness to tragic character in seamless fashion. Her final duet with Croft's Count offers some of the most difficult timing changes and both pull it off with style, grace and charm to spare.

Ann Christine Biel as the wily, coldhearted, eye-on-the-prize, saucy servant Serpetta tries at every turn to steal the show, commenting asides to the audience. She pulls off this calculating character with such perfect comic timing and stage business, whether serving coffee, ironing or spying on the goings on, you'll find your eye focusing on her nearly every scene. I cannot imagine this great archetypal character being performed with more aplomb or better comic timing than Ms. Biel offers here.

Annika Skoglund - at times bearing an uncanny resemblance to actress Julianna Margulies - is the heart-on-sleeve wearing Cavalier Ramiro, desperately pining away for the Count's flightly fiancee, Arminda. She looks ""handsome"" and sometimes is the most masculine acting character on stage! She has a warm, lovely sound that, with too much pressure, can get a bit of a shrillish edge, but that's not inappropriate given the character, and those moments are minimal - and I almost feel guilty mentioning them here, so fine is the rest of her performance.

As the Count's intended, Eva Pilat, with pink streaks through her powdered wig, starts like a house on fire and never lets up. Meeting her fiance for the first time on their supposed wedding day, the spoilt, pampered princess makes no bones about who will be running the show and what punishments she will dole to her future husband should he ever fail to live up to her ""standards."" She makes clear she ""uses the stick"" (and we see her attempt to do so later), and threatens physical violence often. Pilat soars effortlessly through her music and, as nasty as she can be, still allows the audience to fall in love with her.

Petteri Salomaa's face is priceless. Though painted a bit too white, his mugging looks of surprise, that handsome wide mouth circling into an ""O"" straight out of silent movies, the man is a comic gem. A resemblance to Ashton Kutcher will not go unnoticed. Like the rest of the cast, he is a fiercely physical comic actor and the colors in his voice at times make it seem like two completely different singers are employed (and as he plays a role ""in disguise"" this is a very good thing!).

The master of the house, Don Anchise - known as the ""Podesta"" tries to run this show - it is HIS house, after all, but all of his attempted machinations at controlling the chaos prove too much and the man who, at the beginning of this romp looked like a aging buffoon, comes to accept his fate - and that of all those he tried to cajole, control and convict, with enlightenment and panache. Stuart Kale, in his lemon-curd colored wig, simply owns this role - one of the great comic roles every tenor getting beyond the years of romantic hero would be lucky to get. Kale sinks his teeth into each moment, playing it with the abandon and style.

Arnold Ostman conducts the Drottningholm forces in an exciting, rhythmically tour de force that propels the action, lingering only long enough to allow you to catch your breath. In fact, one advantage the viewer has over the live audience is the ability to hit ""pause"" or rewind a minute to catch something that flew by you visually or aurally. Nonetheless, I would have LOVED to have been part of the house when this was filmed, as, from their response, it seems few people in the world were having more fun anywhere that day than were these folk.",1232841600,10,7717,4.898928024502297
2465336,3,B000CIWXT6,"I respect the reviews that I read on these pages. I have not been disappointed often.  Here I find myself playing J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye""  in order to keep some well meaning folk from rushing pell mell over the edge regarding a simple desire to have a wide ranging body of work in their collection of operas. This one is one they  might put off unless they  are fond of other wordly pieces. Monteverdi's ""L'Orpheo"" comes to mind as one such piece. I found myself listening to L'Orpheo several times, by virtue of its strangeness..and surprisingly melifluous, though haphazard strains of melodic tapestry.  After all, that was the year 1600. Naturally, our modern ears would find that music other wordly- meaning another planet-other wordly. It is not one that I would recommend to someone who was not used to hearing this ancient music. The sound quality is great in L'Orpheo; and the orchestra, with all period instruments, is wonderfully rich and opulent, with a deep resonant timbre.

Back to Mozart, here I am afraid one might buy this opera having seen the name Mozart, young prodigy, household name in music...and frankly, be expecting more that this opera actually delivers.  Especially if someone relatively new to opera had heard Donizetti's ""L'Elisir d'Amore""; or Rossini's ""Il Viaggio a Reims""...and then this ""The Secret Gardener"" by the then 18 year old Mozart. I am certain that he or she would feel out of sorts, shifting in his chair, knitting eyebrows, puzzled, and maybe even groaning, or worse, grimacing like the borderline bagatelle clowns on stage.

I don't know how to describe it other than to describe a long term friend of mine of 30 years , who wanted to be a guitarist real bad; so he took the lessons, and practiced the scales, until he could go up and down the neck of the guitar rapidly. There have been many, many great guitarists from this area where I live, all of whom should have made the big time; but that is the nature of the music industry. Brilliant talent doesn't matter one whit. all those guitarists just faded away itno obscurity and penury. The friend who played the scales so rapidly still plays at little cafes, greying hair, fingers slower now...but he still just plays notes without any feel or emotion, or memorable tune.  He is not much more than a mechanical toy.

This opera makes me think of that. Here we are singing every conceivable note, and rythm, and key, from low , low, to high, high....but there  is not one single song you remember, or care to remember. It is hard for me to understand why anyone or any group of people would invest thousands and thousands of man hours on something that leaves not one single melody with you.

The visual aspect of this opera is even more...strange. I am afraid that a lot of people avoid opera like the plague for the simple reason is that they have this image of people in cotton candy wigs, and mime make up, and parachute gowns, and mincing fop outfits, caterwalling endlessly. I am afraid that operas like this one helped create that image.

It is my wonder, and my supreme hope that with good casting, and artful  and imaginative and visionary direction that something like this one can be redeemed somehow. We can only hope.",1152144000,4,3243,4.706713780918728
2465337,5,B000CIWXT6,"Even a casual knowledge of operatic history enables one to list the seven operas that frame Mozart's ""Golden Decade"": 1781-1791. That same casual listener might have come across operas whose titles, exotic sounding names all, are described as products of Mozart's youth; rarely revived musty curiosities like those antiquarian oddities found in glass cases that were so popular in the 18th and 19th Centuries. This strange taxonomy contains names such as Mitridate Re di Ponto, Ascanio in Alba, Lucio Silla and La Finta Giardiniera. As ""museum pieces"", we rush past them like the museum was only the first stop on a High School field trip whose true objective was 2 front row seats on the 50 yard line at the Super Bowl, offered first-come-first-served. I, too, am guilty of ignoring these early Mozartean efforts. Like many opera aficionados, I envisioned some toy piano tinkle-music, mindless Rococo Muzak from a musical Fragonard in Pampers. This prejudice, shared by many, must change.

I played this recently released DVD of La Finta Giardiniera three times in sucession, nearly 8 hours stem to stern, because I could not believe what I was hearing. This was no 18th Century elevator music but a fully realized, dramatically mature and musically accomplished (and beautiful as only Mozart reveals the deeper meaning of that word) work of operatic art. It occurred to me that Mozart was a victim of his own supreme genius. That these adolescent works were guilty of not being Le Nozze di Figaro. But even Mozart wrote only one Figaro. From now on, each work should be judged on its own merits: intrinsic musical value and excellence in comparison to other composers of the era. La Finta is superior to any other composer's comic opera of the period (the ones we know about). As such, it merits inclusion into the standard repertoire. I credit this marvelous DVD for opening my eyes.

La Finta Giardiniera (The pretended gardener), was completed by December 1774 and was the 18 year old Mozart's first attempt at opera buffa other than two small childhood works. Having already composed several opera seria, he was unsure of his abilities in the realm of comedy. That insecurity may be the source of this work's most inspired moments, for there is nothing routine about the inexhaustible flow of melody that is its surface characteristic. What amazes is the psychological penetration revealed in the music, the hallmark of Mozart the mature dramatist. His ability to delineate personality, to probe psychological and emotional states of characters either singly or in ensembles, is present even at this early stage of his career. This singular ability makes Mozart the greatest natural dramatist after Shakespeare; its presence in this opera (though in an immature guise) and its general scarcity in the theatrical world is why La Finta Giardiniera deserves a place on the stage with greater regularity.

The opera premiered at the Redoutensaal, Munich on 13 January 1775; delayed for several weeks due to its demands on the performers. The libretto is by Giuseppe Petrosellini but the story makes little sense in its complexity and is best ignored. Mozart apparently did so, composing the music on-the-fly. Suffice it to say it involves love lost and regained, angry women, confused men, women playing men, mistaken identity, saucy maids, foolish old men, madness (real and feigned), assault with intent to murder and a parakeet.

Filmed in 1988 for Swedish television at the tiny 18th century Drottningholm Court Theatre and featuring its resident period instruments Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Arnold Ostman, it is hard to imagine a better, funnier, more expertly performed version of this opera. Other than Richard Croft who plays Il Contino Belfiore, the cast is unknown to me. Nevertheless, they are superb in every aspect of this production. The singing is wonderful, the acting likewise. Though uniformly excellent, I still must single out for praise Ann Christine Biel as the saucy maid Serpetta and Petteri Salomaa as Nardo. Their comic gifts shine. Also quite superb (and a dead ringer for actress Jennifer Connolly) playing Il Cavalier Ramiro is Annika Skoglund. Stuart Kale is Don Anchise and Britt-Marie Aruhn is La Marchesa Violante. Eva Pilat is Arminda. There is a lively intelligence about this production that makes it so entertaining.

The image on this disc is clear without any obvious video artifacts. It looks as if it were digitally remastered. The sound format on this disc is PCM stereo which is very clear and quite ""live"" sounding with great presence. The film is in color with a picture format of full screen 4:3. The region code is NTSC 0. Menu languages are German, French, English and Spanish. There are the usual 6 subtitle languages. The running time of this disc is 150 minutes. There are no extras other than excellent notes included in an informative 40 page booklet written in English, French and German.

I strongly recommend this thoroughly entertaining DVD. Anyone with even a moderate love for Mozart's operas will probably treasure this disc as much as I do. You may be surprised at the maturity of the 18 year old Mozart.

8099083,5,B000CIWXT6,"This is a charming production. Perhaps the best staging faithful to Mozart's atmosphere and spirit.

Once the pleasant absurdity of the story accepted, it preserves the great fun of buffa, while Mozart's sensitivity to emotional crisis explodes into magnificent seria in Arminda's No. 13 aria 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno'  and Ramiro's No. 26 aria 'Va Pure Ad Altri In Braccio'.

The 7 roles include 3 buffa characters (Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo), 1 seria (Ramiro), and 3 ""mezzo carattere"" (Arminda, Sandrina, Contino).

We can compare this 1988 Ostman/Drottningholm staging with Harnoncourt's 1991 Vienna CD, and his 2006 Zurich DVD (""H/Z""). Even following the Italian libretto, it is not easy to make out the Italian words. Light secondary orchestral phrases or interjections are barely audible.

- Stuart Kale is a much funnier and lighter Podesta than in ""H/Z"".
- Richard Croft, as Contino Belfiore, is an effeminate 18th c. light-witted lover, more typical than the goofy Contino in H/Z.
The ladies are all superb beauties, with lovely voices.
Eva Pilat as the controlling Arminda;
Britt-Marie Aruhn as Marchesa Violante Onesti, going as ""Sandrina"";
Ann Christine Biel as the impertinent Serpetta, equalled, if not surpassed, by Julia Kleiter in ""H/Z"";
Annika Skoglund, as Ramiro, the only constantly seria character, has a better physique for the role than Nikiteanu in ""H/Z"".
Petteri Salomaa as Nardo, is an exaggerated country bumpkin who turns clever in his No. 24 aria 'Mirate Che Contrasto'.

Most regrettably, serious cuts in scenes and recitatives,  eliminating 7 arias (out of 22 1/2), to wit:
No. 4: Aria ""Noi donne poverine"" (Sandrina)
No. 5: Aria ""A forza di martelli"" (Nardo)
No. 8: Aria ""Da Scirocco a Tramontana"" (Contino)
No. 15: Aria 'Care Pupille' (Contino)
No. 16: Aria 'Una Voce Sento Al Core' (Sandrina) [also missing in ""H/Z""]
No. 17: Aria 'Una Damina, Una Nipote' (Podesta)
No. 18: Aria 'Dolce D'Amor Compagna Speranza' (Ramiro) [also missing in ""H/Z"")

No. 2 Aria ""Se l'augellin sen fugge"" (Ramiro), is moved from Act I, sc. 1, to Act II, sc. 9, this time featuring a caged bird, but replacing the original No. 18 Aria. Still, the flow of the story is well preserved, and the pace surely enhanced. But the intoxicating music of Mozart's 7 arias and scenes is lost, all too sadly.

Fortunately the scintillating ensembles have been left intact.

The direction is superb, thanks to the staging resources of Drottningholm. The excellent acting maintains the fast pace needed by playful ""buffoneria"".

Credit goes to an inventive libretto full of hilarious fun -- the epitome of classical buffa. This delightful, farcical, story gives vast opportunities to Mozart for unbridled creation of themes, and accents to mark each moment and each personality with remarkable orchestral interactions and interjections. Mozart follows this exciting libretto to the letter, beautifully expressing each fleeting variation of mood suggested by the text.

Oh, why didn't the team include all the arias?

We can still enter the spirit of buffa, taking this farce's implausible plot as a delightfully irrational tale (cf. Voltaire's ""Candide""). Imagine a girl stabbed by her fianc, left for dead, and then, once recovered, going around to look for the stabbing lover and continue her love liaison so accidently ""interrupted""!.
Mozart successfully translates this innocently absurd story into a great opera -- our admiration is boundless.

This quaint, charming, Swedish version, with beautiful singers/actors, in ravishing period costumes and stage scenery of Drottningholm, retains Mozart's graceful elegance and conveys the exuberant 18th c. buffa spirit.

This exciting opera is enough to negate the hackneyed clichs of the older generation who dismissed Mozart's teenage music as ""juvenilia"", unworthy of the ""mature"" master. Nothing was more erroneous. Mozart at 30 was still a very young man, not very far, in style and spirit, from the adolescent of 18. Both Hermann Abert and Stanley Sadie have recognized the unique charm of adolescent yearning and boundless energy in Mozart's ""early"" operas, different from the later ""Vienna"" operas.

Most commentators don't really know Mozart's operas well except the established five operas of the 1780's (and now 7 for the advanced amateurs, including ""Idomeneo"" and ""Clemenza"").
They repeat, mechanically, the adjectives ""immature"" and ""mature"", not having the faintest idea of the ""early"" operas. The only thing ""immature"" is their lack of curiosity and knowledge.
Indeed, the younger generation is lucky to start their exploration of Mozart's operas with such a magnificent ""Finta Giardiniera"".

A COMPLEX PLOT, RICH IN DRAMATIC SURPRISES

The libretto is a marvelous classic ""opera buffa"" of the time of Mozart.

The story is a non-stop series of incredible surprises, beyond all common sense and rationality, each one amazing and highly dramatic, and, when well acted, extremely entertaining.
All is happening at fast pace, keeping the action on a high pitch. The text is full of humor and irony. It is a farce of the highest style, a masterpiece of the genre. All the scenes are interesting, the text often hilarious, and never taken seriously. The incidents:

- A murder attempt: Count Belfiore (""Contino"") has previously stabbed Marquise Violante Onesti in a fit of jealousy and fled, leaving her for dead.
- The action revolves around Violante's faithfulness: she goes around, as ""Sandrina"", looking for her past lover. She rejects advances, especially that of her new employer, the mayor ""Podesta"".
- This is a game of false indentities: Violante goes incognito, disguised as ""Sandrina"", the garden-girl, accompanied by her servant, ""Nardo"".
- There is a thwarted society marriage: between ""Arminda"", Podesta's niece, and the stranger, ""Contino"" Belfiore. This is the central event at the start of the opera.
- There's a pre-trial instruction scene: Belfiore, accused of murder, must answer questions from Podesta before any marriage can take place.
- There is violence and kidnapping: Sandrina is abducted by Arminda and abandoned in a wild forest full of strange beasts.
- There are wild scenes of total confusion: All the characters go on the search for Sandrina in the dark forest, and form blind pairs under mistaken beliefs of identity.
- There's also authentic madness: Both Sandrina and Belfiore are overwhelmed by the complexity of their fates and lose their minds.
- There's general reconciliation and final happiness, except for Podesta.

The dynamo of the action is three love relationships that extend into triangles. All feelings are manifested: love, jealousy, faithfulness, forgiveness, pardon, reconciliation, class superiority, social hierarchies, astonishment, madness, mismatched pairings, joy and ecstacy.

Mozart has to give expression to all these feelings and frame the series of irrational events in brilliant music that lasts more than 3h 15'. He succeeds unfailingly.

A MIX OF SERIOUS SENTIMENTALITY WITH EXTREME BUFFA

Mozart must have been delighted with this libretto. The lightness of the poet's touch allows Mozart to use the speed and energy of his syncopated music to best effect, combined with touches of the grandiose style, a mastery just demonstrated in ""Mitridate"" and ""Lucio Silla"".

The libretto is inspired by Goldoni's and Piccinni's ""La buona figliuola"" (1760), an example of the ""comdie larmoyante"" focused on feminine sensibility made fashionable by Samuel Richardson's European best seller, ""Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded"" (1740). A humble, virtuous, young woman goes through hardships, harassments, and temptations, only to be, at the end of her adventures, revealed to be an aristocrat. In both Piccinni's and Mozart's libretti, the virtuous lady is disguised (""finta"") as a gardener (""giardiniera"").

But the ""poet"", Petrosellini, added a series of sensational, even insane, surprises to graft the old ""buffa"" style on the new genre of sentimental comedy. The comic absurdity of the events and mistaken identities is taken in stride for the sheer fun of it, as it will also be in ""Cosi fan tutte"".

Pasquale Anfossi had set the same libretto just a year before, 1774, in a classical ""buffa"" style with sharply defined characters. Mozart changed the coloration of the piece by making his characters more complex in psychology, and the action more dramatic.

NUMBERS & ARIAS OF THE ORIGINAL SCORE

I am adding quotes from Hermann Abert's monumental&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/W-A-MOZART/dp/0300072236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">W.A. MOZART</a>&nbsp;(1919, transl. 2007)

The original score has 28 numbers.
4 ensembles No. 1, No. 12, No. 23, No. 28, one at the beginning, and another at the end of each act.
1 1/2 duets No. 24b, No. 27, both between the lovers Sandrina/Contino

22 1/2 arias for 7 characters
- Sandrina - 5 arias - No. 4 (missing), No. 11, No. 16 (missing), No. 21, No. 22
- Contino - 4 arias - No. 6, No. 8 (missing), No. 15 (missing), No. 19
- Ramiro - 3 arias - No. 2, No. 18 (missing), No. 26
- Podesta - 3 arias - No. 3, No. 17 (missing), No. 25
- Nardo - 3 arias - No. 5 (missing), No. 9b, No. 14, No. 24a
- Serpetta - 2  arias - No. 9a, No. 10, No. 20
- Arminda - 2 arias - No. 7, No. 13

Sandrina has the lion's share of the singing. She gets 5 arias, and 2 duets with Contino. Contino has 4 arias, and the 2 duets. Ramiro, Nardo, Podesta, have each 3 arias. Serpetta has 2  arias, and Arminda is given only 2 arias. But she sings the most grandiose of them all, No. 13.
In addition there are four ensembles. Those ending Act I and II are particularly long: 15' and 16' respectively, where Mozart displays his extraordinary talent for choreographing the intertwining music of 7 singers accompanied by a rich invention of orchestral themes and interjections.

ACT I

No. 1: Ensemble ""Che lieto giorno"" (Sandrina, Serpetta, Ramiro, Il Podesta, Nardo)

What a lovely day!

[The initial ensemble is sung individually in turn by each of the 5 characters -- keeping Contino and Arminda in reserve for their grand entrance.
Ramiro is unhappy as his love for Arminda is not returned. Podesta rejoices that Sandrina will marry him. Sandrina is miserable, and will remain so until the happy ending. Nardo resents Serpetta for her indifference. Serpetta resents the arrival of Sandrina and Nardo, and laments Podesta's infatuation with Sandrina, concluding that all men are false. Podesta rejoices for the wedding of his niece Arminda with high nobility.
In this introduction to the plot. ""Mozart moves with great assurance and with an unmistakable sense of dramatic purpose"", even if the characters are presented one by one, rather than in a spirited ensemble.]

No. 2: Aria ""Se l'augellin sen fugge"" (Ramiro) [MOVED TO REPLACE No. 18]

[Podesta has consoled Ramiro that, if Arminda does not love him anymore, nothing to worry, he will find another woman.]

Like a bird who has escaped from the cage, and cannot be returning, the idea of another capture terrifies me.

[Sentimental unhappy lovers are ""figures of fun"" in ""buffa"". For Mozart, the role of Ramiro is ""entirely serious"", worrying about ""l'idea d'un altro laccio/Ah che tremar mi fa"" (The idea of another trap/How it makes me tremble.)]

No. 3: Aria ""Dentro il mio petto io sento"" (Il Podesta)

[Podesta has fallen in love with his beautiful new garden-girl, and wants to marry her. He tries to declare his love to her, but Serpetta keeps interfering.]

My heart is hearing an orchestra playing. First, the sweetness of flutes and oboes. Then the strings which start troubling the atmosphere. Finally the winds and drums bring me to despair.

[A classic ""buffa"" trick: At each mention of an instrument, the same one in the orchestra responds. Podesta is a true buffo part, usually a bass. Here he becomes a tenor.]

No. 4: Aria ""Noi donne poverine"" (Sandrina) [MISSING]

[She's reminded Nardo of her plight: The previous year, her lover Contino Belfiore had stabbed her in a jealous fit, and fled, leaving her for dead. Her only desire is to find him again. She does not want the unrequited attentions of a new lover like Podesta, and prefers to go away.]

We, sad women, are subjected to mens' tormenting advances.

No. 5: Aria ""A forza di martelli"" (Nardo) [MISSING]

[He complains about his predicament. Serpetta avoids him and averts his gaze. Her heart is harder than iron or stone.]

The force of hammers can forge iron, chisels can carve marble. But nothing can tame the heart of a woman. Men are fools to chase women, they play games.

[Nardo's first aria. He has a mixed role. He is ""the infatuated simpleton who pursues Serpetta in spite of all the rebuffs."" But he also has a genuine side betraying ""real spirit"".]

No. 6: Aria ""Che belta, che leggiadria"" (Il Contino)

[Contino has arrived in a carriage for his wedding to Arminda. He is a ""generous cavalier, always in thrall to more than one woman at once. As a perfect gentleman, he begins by praising Arminda's beauty.""]

What beauty, what charm. You are the sun, and your rays make me stagger.

[This entry is not exactly comic. Belfiore ""strikes a note of manly ardour that occasionally anticipates Belmonte"" in ""Entfhrung.""]

No. 7: Aria ""Si promette facilmente"" (Arminda)

[Arminda is not easily convinced or duped.]

Men's promises are too easy nowadays, to induce simple women to say ""yes"". But I am not of the same kind, I want clear agreements before saying ""yes"". Everything has to be all right. Contino, you are my life, my expectations. But should you cheat, as is the current custom, I will wreak vengeance with my own hands.

[Her first aria. She is ""as agitated as she is cunning"", and, although an aristocrat, ""lapses into the tone of an artful chambermaid"", halfway between ""seria"" and ""buffa"".]

No. 8: Aria ""Da Scirocco a Tramontana"" (Contino) [MISSING]

[To Podesta, Contino vaunts his own beauty, his merits, his military prowess, but he's become a prisoner of Armida's beauty. He's left all his grand world for her. Podesta laughs at this.]

From the south to the north, I have grand estates, my grand lineage goes back to Roman consuls and emperors.

[This is a genuine buffo motif: boasting of his grand ""aristocratic accomplishments told with pompous conceit.""]

No. 9a: Cavatina ""Un marito, oh Dio,vorrei"" (Serpetta)

[She is unhappy, harassed by Arminda's demands. She wants to avoid the sighs of Nardo]

I would want a husband who's loving, but not an aging one.

[Serpetta is another authentic ""buffa"" part. ""Like the rest of her kind, Serpetta is an out-and-out egoist, malicious, and spiteful"" aiming her sights at Podesta, like Serpina in Pergolesi's ""La Serva Padrona"" (Naples, 1733).]

No. 9b: Cavatina ""Un marito, oh Dio, vorresti"" (Nardo)

[Nardo answers Serpetta in the same style.]

You would want a loving husband. But a young one would not be right for you.

No. 10: Aria ""Appena mi vedon"" (Serpetta)

[She's told Nardo again that she has no feelings for him, but he does not get the message. See, she has no problem finding lovers.]

As soon as men see me, they flock to me, admiring my charms, and swearing eternal love. I play the modest one, answer nothing, and let them go by.

[Her charming second aria. She professes her policy of disguising her true character, and presenting only a ""charming, mischievous exterior.""]

No. 11: Cavatina 'Geme La Tortorella' (Sandrina)

[The orchestra describes the dove's cooing in ""a moving and genuinely Mozartian mixture of charm and melancholy.""]

The turtle dove sighs when away from her mate, she laments and hopes to excite pity.

No. 12: Finale of Act I 'Numi! Che Incanto E Questo' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo). A long ensemble, 15' 09""

[Arminda announces to Sandrina that today she is marrying the Contino. Sandrina, in shock, faints. The Contino arrives and proposes to help.]

Gods, what magic is this?

[Complex action follows in multiple sections.]

Contino, in ""an impassioned accompagnato"", approaches Sandrina and recognizes her features, her voice. Sandrina recovers, sees the Contino, and recognizes him. ""A motif of whimpering fear"" is mixed with ""hurried interjections"".
Ramiro enters with Arminda and presses his suit. Both couples are confused. Each character expresses his/her emotional crisis, all starting ""with the same melodic line"", ending with a 4-voice ensemble ""with words broken up by rests"" while ""the oboes intone a sustained lament.""
Podesta now enters ""to the emotionally charged sound of the horns"" and asks for an explanation. They answer in a chorus.
Podesta is left alone, wondering and raging, ""Che tratto e questo"", what's going on?
He is stopped by Serpetta who fuels his jealousy by telling him that the ""giardiniera"" is making love with Contino in the garden. Nardo warns Podesta that Serpetta is lying.
Sandrina reproaches his cruelty to Contino, who kneels asking for her pardon. But Sandrina claims that she is only repeating what Violante said before dying, and tries to convince Contino that she is not his former lover.
As Contino is kneeling to Sandrina, he is discovered by all.
Arminda, ""in an ironical outburst"", is angry at the fecklessness of her intended spouse. Ramiro eggs her on. Contino is at a loss, torn between his two loves. They all express together their irony, anger, fury, or, for Serpetta and Nardo, their secret satisfaction, at the duplicity of the count and Sandrina.

[Abert notes that this finale, in one section, ""is a masterpiece of characterization and of gripping tension"" and of orchestral expression. ""Only rarely did Italian composers produce anything as good as this.""]

ACT II

No. 13: Aria 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno' (Arminda)

[Contino has expressed his predicament. Since he's spotted Violante's features in Sandrina, he is desperate and wants to find her back. Arminda has noticed his agitation, and explodes in high-flown anger at his betraying her on their wedding day.]

I want to punish you, unworthy man, I want to tear you heart out, but my love holds me back. I feel both anger and compassion for you.

[In Arminda's second aria, ""she is the offended aristocrat thirsting for vengeance."" Not a trace of parody. It is a grandiose aria of ""opera seria"". ""It is a typically Mozartian G minor movement in all its bitter passion, seething with disquiet."" In expressions of anger and fury, Mozart easily reaches the most sublime heights of passion.]

No. 14: Aria 'Con Un Vezzo All' Italiana' (Nardo)

[Nardo keeps pursuing Serpetta. She tells him to back off. But she may have nicer feelings if he sings her a passionate love song that could impress her.]

In the sweet Italian style, I say that you set my heart on fire, then I'll say it in French style, then in English style, but nothing pleases Serpetta.

[Nardo's second aria shows him as being more than a stupid buffo servant.]

No. 15: Aria 'Care Pupille' (Contino) [MISSING]

[Contino is persuaded that Sandrina is Violante. She tries to dissuade him by pretending she knows the story from Violante who told her about his murderous behavior before dying. Contino is transfixed by the resemblance.]

Dear beautiful eyes, look at me [but Serpetta refuses, and motions him to leave] Before leaving, I'd love to kiss your hand, as a sign of his love.

[But the Podesta, unobserved, has stepped to Sandrina's side, and Contino, kisses his hand instead.]

Disaster, this is my bad luck.

[""The vain fop reverts to his former role as a lover."" He shows ""far greater sincerity than towards Arminda...in an aria full of real emotional depth"". The comic element results from the stage action.]

No. 16: Aria 'Una Voce Sento Al Core' (Sandrina) [MISSING]

[Podesta renews his pursuit, confesses his love, and asks Sandrina to go with him. She does not want to, ""Perche non voglio"". Podesta is indignant, she is just a lowly servant. She resents his lack of respect for her feelings. She begs him to forgive her flight of temper.]

I hear a voice in my heart telling me that, behind you scornful mien, Podesta is full of compassion for me. But you rudeness hurts me. Young women who hear my plea should try to console me.

[The second section of her unhappiness ""strikes a profoundly tragic note"" with no intention of parody, ""a sudden outburst of heightened emotion...meant to be taken seriously.]

No. 17: Aria 'Una Damina, Una Nipote' (Podesta) [MISSING]

[Arminda still wants to marry Contino. Ramiro announces the receipt of an order to pass on to Podesta for the arrest of Contino Belfiore who is accused of murder. Ramiro is secretly delighted. Podesta postpones the wedding, since, if Contino is guilty, he cannot marry Podesta's niece.]

This young lady, my niece, with beauty and standing, I cannot plunge her into misfortune. My good name would be ridiculed by all in Germany, in France, Spain. Don't even think of it. This will not happen.

[Podesta's second aria. He sings the affront to his social status and dignity.]

No. 18: Aria 'Dolce D'Amor Compagna Speranza' (Ramiro) [MISSING, REPLACED BY No. 2 Aria, with cute bird in cage added.]

[He tries to engage Arminda in sweet talk, but she cuts him short. She is burning with contempt for him.]

Sweet companion of love, flattering hope is giving me strength and comfort, and sustains my life.

[Ramiro's second aria expresses ""the tenderness typical of all such lyrical youths"", with a coloratura flourish that does not belong to ""buffa"".]

No. 19: Recitativo 'Ah non partir...m'ascolta', and No. 19 aria `Gia divento freddo, freddo' (Contino)

[Contino arrives for the wedding. He is questioned by Podesta on being accused of murder. Contino blabbers, it was love, jealousy, an accident. Arminda is disgusted by his idiocy. The rapid-fire interrogation animates this secco recitative and the play of the orchestra's basses.
It is Sandrina who saves him by revealing she is marquise Violante, to everyone's stupefaction.
Podesta leaves, in despair at losing his Sandrina. Arminda also leaves, to prepare her revenge.
Contino, in his joy, wants to kiss Sandrina's hand. But Sandrina defuses Contino's enthusiasm by claiming she used her resemblance by pretending to be Violante only to save him. He should run to his great love, Arminda.]

Ah do not leave...listen to me. She rejects me, the earth is moving, a fog engulfs me. Is this a storm? Is it day or night? Do you want me to die? Are you crying? What for? Lightning is striking. Only heaven can save me. All should weep, I am dying. A mortal cold is invading me. But wait, I feel a light breeze, I can see the sun shining, I am still alive, and joy and hope are revived.

[Mad characters in ""buffa"" are comic figures used to parody ""seria"". Mozart starts with an ""emphatically tragic note"" in the recitative, but the orchestra teeming with ""motifs constantly and importunately changing, betrays a sense of parody"" accentuated by thunder and lightning on the stage. Contino ends with a ""homely expression to the joy felt at recovering from madness"" which ""incorporates ""buffa"" elements.""]

No. 20: Aria 'Chi Vuol Godere Il Mondo' (Serpetta)

[Nardo cannot find Sandrina. Serpetta announces Sandrina is gone. Podesta orders a search, even though it's already night. Serpetta reveals that Sandrina has been abducted by Arminda and abandoned in a dark forest full of ravenous beasts, where perhaps a hungry wolf will devour her. Serpetta is sorry, but Sandrina did ask for it. Serpetta must be political, hide her feelings and use pretense in playing the game of love.]

Who wants to enjoy the world must take it as it comes. A girl should be sincere and gay, but it's of no use with men today. Better be shy and indifferent, and make them wait. This is the lesson my mother taught me.

[Serpetta's third and last aria, continuing with exposing her policy of being ""political"", and the need to project feigned feelings and use secrecy if a poor girl is to reach her goals.]

No. 21: Aria 'Crudeli, oh Dio! Fermate' (Sandrina)

[Obscure silhouettes are seen disappearing in a deserted place, leaving Sandrina in a grotto.]

Oh God! Stop, you cruel people. You have abandoned and left me all alone among those rocks.

[Mozart reverts to classical ""seria"", with an ""emotionally charged lamento scene"" ""with a wildly impassioned motif in the violins"". In the ""agitated turmoil in the orchestra"" the voice is ""confined to declamatory phrases,"" expressing ""the indignant despair of a tragic heroine, with the desire for vengeance."" Sandrina ""suddenly grows in stature and becomes a heroine in the grand tradition.""]

No. 22: Cavatina 'Ah dal Pianto, dal Singhiozzo' (Sandrina)

Ah, with my crying and sighing, I can barely breathe. My grief is overwhelming, my spirit is fading.

[Same sense of ""disquiet in the orchestra, declamatory writing in the vocal line, and heightened emotion."" Sandrina ""descends into a state of utter hopelessness."" The ""sustained note of seriousness"" leaves the world of ""opera buffa"". The part was written for Rosa Manservici, a singer/actress of high repute.]

No. 23: Finale of Act II 'Fra Quest' Ombre, O Questo Scuro' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo) 16' 16""

[In the darkness of the forest, everybody appears: First Nardo and Contino, then Arminda checking on Contino, then Podesta and Serpetta, and finally Ramiro, each with different intents. They all hear indistinct noises.]

In these shadows, in this darkness...

[Complex action ensues in long sections during the lengthy ensemble, with pairings of mistaken identities in the dark forest.]

Podesta grabs Arminda, believing her to be Sandrina, while Arminda believes him to be Contino.
Contino grabs Serpetta, believing her to be Sandrina, while Serpetta believes him to be Podesta.
Nardo finds Sandrina and recognizes her, as Sandrina also recognizes him, and believes herself saved.
The confusion continues, until Ramiro and a group of torches arrives.
Ramiro enjoys the moment. They all recognize their errors.
Arminda rages at Contino; Podesta rages at Sandrina; Nardo and Serpetta continue their jousting; Ramiro and Arminda continue their quarreling.
Sandrina and Contino, bewildered, slide into a gentle delirium, she fancying to be Cloris, he Orfeo.
Podesta demands a duel of pistols with Contino, Ramiro a duel with swords.
Sandrina becomes Medusa, Contino Alcides.
The others are dumbfounded by the spectacle of the couple lost in their mad happiness.

[Mozart lets the orchestra ""depict the strangeness of the situation"" in the forest, ""with declamatory writing for the voices"". This ""captures"" the ""frightening noises"", the ""timid whisperings"", the ""tiptoeing to and fro"", while ""the skipping basses and chuckling woodwinds ensure that the situation does not become too serious.""]

ACT III

No. 24a: Aria 'Mirate Che Contrasto' (Nardo)

[Serpetta repeats to Nardo she does not want him. Contino arrives, taking Nardo for his beloved. Then Sandrina stops him, taking him for her spouse. Nardo tries to distract them both.]

Look at the contrast between the sun and moon. And the lovesick stars. And then their duel, their wrestling.

[Nardo's last aria is accompanied by ""an increasingly agitated"" orchestra. His sense of ridicule ""already anticipates Leporello's elogquent impishness"" in ""Don Giovanni""].

No. 24b: Duetto ""Da bravi seguitate"" (Sandrina, Contino)

[The lovers are still in thrall to madness.]

Carry on, good people. The moon is falling. Help, a storm is breaking out.

[Mozart does not exploit the ""buffa"" ""grotesque exaggeration"" in this ""absurd situation"". The lovers' first duet is ""far too serious"" for ""buffa"".]

No. 25: 'Aria 'Mio Padrone, Io Dir Volevo' (Podesta) [Missing in ""H/Z""]

[Podesta is harassed, first by Serpetta, who reminds him of his past promises; then by Arminda who wants her Contino; and by Ramiro, who wants Arminda. Podesta can't take the accumulated tension any longer.]

My Lord, I wanted to say to you...Let me speak (""Ma lasciatemi parlar""). Arminda, take your Contino. Ramiro, marry my niece. Don't bother me any more.

[Podesta's third and last aria is about his loss of control when ""assailed on every side."" Note the ""extremely flexible and independent writing for the orchestra, which already looks forward to the later composer"" (!).
It is ironical that Abert found that Mozart, the adolescent composer, was already being Mozart, the accomplished musician, before he became ""Mozart"", the icon for posterity. The illusion of hindsight hits and obfuscates most of the previous Mozart scholars before Stanley Sadie.]

No. 26: Aria 'Va Pure Ad Altri In Braccio' (Ramiro)

[Arminda repeats to Ramiro that he cannot hope for anything from a woman who doesn't love him.]

Go then into other arms, but I'll pursue you. I'll die miserably.

[Ramiro's third and last is another grand bravura aria, an ""outburst of oddly unbridled anger."" It is ""a counterpart to Arminda's grandiose aria No. 13, 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno'"" but ""more vehement and demonic"" in expressing the ""despair of a fatally wounded heart"", never heard before in ""buffa"". Mozart, ever since childhood, is always at his most powerful when depicting anger, rage, vengeance -- his ""demonic"" side, dixit Abert.]

No. 27: Duetto 'Tu Mi Lasci?' (Sandrina, Contino)

[Sandrina and Contino awake from their sleep, lying apart on a meadow. They sight and recognize each other. She moves to depart.]

Are you leaving me?

[They seem to be leaving on opposite sides, but stop, and, gradually return, slowly getting close together, and admit their love.]

Who can resist love? Joy and happiness in our hearts.

[This is the second lovers' duet in their grand scene, ""on a far higher level"" than the first, with its classical action of ""lovers' mutual recognition, followed by temporary discord, and ultimate reconciliation."" The music is exquisitely insightful, catching the fleeting moods, tender or ardent, of the two lovers.]

No. 28: Finale of Act III. Recitative and Coro 'Viva Pur La Giardiniera' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo) total 3' 47""

[""Scena Ultima"" starts with a final ensemble recitative. The madness is over. The lovers reunite, they will marry. Sandrina acknowledges her disguise.
Arminda begs pardon for kidnapping Sandrina.
Podesta gives in, he gives his blessing to Arminda marrying her Ramiro, and to Serpetta her Nardo. Podesta, left alone, will marry when he finds another Sandrina.
Sandrina will always remember his goodness, and remain ""la finta giardiniera per amore.""
It ends with the traditional advice to the audience to enjoy love.]

Viva pur la Giardiniera...Viva amore/Che fa tutti rallegrar.
(Long live the garden-girl...long live love/Which makes everyone happy.)

IN CONCLUSION: ""OPERA BUFFA"" GETS MARRIED TO ""OPERA SERIA""

Mozart shows his superior ""dramatic gifts"" and ""greater mastery"" in the ensembles, with ""sharply contrasted characters"", where ""the plot moves quickly, with a lively exchange"".

Remarkable also is the ""unusual role of tragedy"" in this ""buffa"", where ""sudden outbursts of authentic passion"", with no parody intent, ""were inconceivable."" Mozart's characters are ""suddenly wracked"" with passions. The whole opera is no longer a pleasing harmony of tone, as in traditional ""buffa"".

But the mix permits ""a wealth of invention and sheer originality."" Mozart, by sensitivity and unique temperament, could not ""treat deep-seated emotions as a source of ridicule"", and tended ""to emphasize these emotions with all the demonic ardour of his soul, breaking down the barriers of ""opera buffa""...for the first time in history.""
""This is Mozart's first attempt to tear the masks from the faces of his Italian characters and allow them to speak the language of the heart.""

Comedy and tragedy ""appear alongside each other, with no inner or outer connection, comedy in the motley of `opera buffa', tragedy in the guise of `opera seria'."" Regardless, the result is a unique, energetic, excitingly beautiful opera, a sure crowd-pleaser.

Abert's final evaluation is amusing for its inveterate Romantic flavor: "" 'La Finta Giardiniera' is the work of a young genius driven in a new direction by a dark and irresistibly powerful force."" Mozart will find the perfect style to intimately combine comedy and tragedy only once he will have ""known life's harsh vicissitudes"", when ""the goal was to be revealed in all its blinding clarity"" (p. 339).

8099087,3,B000CIWXT6,Well done opera on a small stage with period pieces; made me feel Mozart would come out after the show. If this were not by Mozart I guarantee you this opera would have been buried in obscurity. I bet there were thousands of operas like this in history never heard of again because the composer was not by this famous genius. By all means see it for $15 dollars. You will not remember any thing about it a week later because it is not a very memorable opera.,1302566400,,458,4.215909090909091
8099088,5,B000CIWXT6,"Yes, it's an early Mozart opera, not quite his mature style, although there are touches we will all recognize.  I got the feeling that since this was Mozart's first attempt at an opera buffa, he turned to imitating a master of the style, in this case, Pergolesi.  There are idiomatic hints of _La Serva Padrona_ all over this opera, and if Mozart had not yet perfected his own style, this was certainly as good a source of material as any.

In addition, this production from Drottningholm is exemplary in many ways.  Period instrument are actually sometimes capable of _more_ dramatic contrasts  than their modern counterparts, even if they do require fewer decibels to achieve this effect. This makes Don Anchise's aria particularly delightul, with the orchestra illustrating the flutes and oboes he hears in his heart.

Also, although I was unfamiliar with any of the singers, I am impressed with all of them.  First, musically: no matter how bumbling, doddering, or enraged the character in the opera, Mozart's music requires a certain lightness and agility, and these singers all achieve it, while at the same time displaying the full expressive ranges of their characters.  In this regard, particular kudos go to Petteri Salomaa Eva Pilat, since, as a bass and a dramatic soprano, their training would have been the most likely to lead them to forego melody and pitch in favor of ""color,"" but they never did this once in the entire opera.  Likewise, Stuart Kale, as the amorous old (middle-aged, we'd say now) man, while occasionally heavy-handed with the use of his authority, is never heavy-handed in his singing.  It may sound like faint praise, but as a trained harpsichordist and singer, I have to say that if all opera singers were capable of this, there would be far less need of a separate school of singing early music. I want to own this DVD as the quickest way to set myself in a good place vocally by example.

Also, much of the acting is priceless, both in terms of the singing, and the body language of the actors.  The makeup may appear overdone, but we should remember that in the 18th century, most people above a certain social level wore makeup most of the time as part of their daily grooming.  The makeup designer did a very good job of making all the men (not including Ramiro, played by a woman) look silly through makeup, mostly by means of their eyebrows. The Serpetta (Ann Christine Biel) is bold spiteful and vain, much as we would expect of a character with that name (Little Snake), but adorable the whole while.  Count Belfiore (Richard Croft) is wonderful at distinguishing between the courtly gallantry his character uses with Arminda, whom he is ostensibly supposed to be about to marry, and the real passion he shows Sandrina/Violante, the woman he loves and thought he had killed.  Arminda (Eva Pilat) is domineering, violent, and a complete hoot.  Ramiro (Annik,a Skoglund), as the only completely serious character, is always completely believable as being male and enraged; she is particularly good at moving with exaggerated force. Nardo (Petteri Salomaa) is appropriately graceful, even while dressed as a bumpkin, and the contrast adds comic energy of its own.  Stuart Kale, at first bounding about and dancing with the joy of his revived youthful passion, and finally frantic and frazzled, never appears to give less than all his energy, while at the same time not letting it overpower his singing.

And best of all, although none of the singers are actually Italian, they all manage to look it.",1255996800,5,3542,4.86522462562396
8099089,4,B000CIWXT6,"My recent experience with the Mozart 22 video of this opera made me eager to listen when I saw that Kulture was distributing it (new on most store's DVD shelves). As one of the reviewers pointed out, the Mozart 22, which tends to modernize all its productions, decided, presumably because the title mentions a gardener, to make the set a Home Depot type of garden super-store. Certainly they did manage a lively presentation within its storage shelf interior, Nothing much left of a Mozart feel, but, no doubt, there are those who enjoyed the novelty of it, On the other hand, somewhat tongue in cheek, the Swedish company gave it an orchestra with vintage instruments, a set whose very cozy feel and mildly period look gave a sense of authenticity, and a cast that could sing well and, while performing the antics native to the libretto (and to the operatic type), give us the feel that we should not take too seriously what they were doing. No musicologist I, it is a relief to say that I have no idea where this score stands in Mozart's collected works nor how it should be rated in some scale of musical quality, I found it to be melodious throughout and a joy to hear.",1247702400,,1173,4.537735849056604
8099090,3,B000CIWXT6,"I recommend this Staatsoper Stuttgart production for a fine performance of Mozart's richly orchestrated music by the Staatsorchester Stuttgart under conductor Lothar Zagrosek, and for the singing, which for the most part is quite wonderful. Cellia Costea as Arminda and Alexandra Reinprecht as Sandrina-Violante are outstanding. I also very much liked Rudolf Rosen as Nardo and Irena Bespalovaite as Serpetta. However, I found the setting and staging disappointingly inappropriate to the opera's themes, more on which below. The costumes, which are traditional, are marvelous.

The full opera on the CD version that I own lasts over three hours. This Stuttgart production takes liberties with the score and libretto: it is only 139 minutes, omits several arias--I counted 8 missing--and reorders scenes, especially in  Acts II and III. I am not knowledgeable enough about opera to know if such changes are acceptable or legitimate; in any case they are my reason for 3 instead of 4 stars. La Finta Giardiniera is a mixed genre piece with elements of both opera buffa and opera seria. Some Mozart commentators that I have read criticize the plot as chaotic or confusing. Perhaps this would justify some cutting and rearranging, but in my opinion the plot is no more confusing or complex that that of, say, Le Nozze di Figaro, which no one would dare cut (I hope).

While praising the music as delightful throughout, some critics also disparage La Finta Giardiniera for its poorly developed characters. Alfred Einstein (""Mozart: His Character, His Work"") calls them ""types."" Robert Gutman (""Mozart: A Cultural Biography"") calls them ""...types, schematic figures engaged in conventional harlequinades..."" yet grants them ""graded contours."" This estimation of the characters as types must have inspired the odd and to me unpleasant staging of this production, as well as some characters' peculiar stylized gesticulations such as the mechanical-doll gestures they make during the Act I finale. As the performance opens, the characters are standing in a set of doorways set in a bright yellow wall that spans the width of the stage. In Act II this setting is replaced by a giant kind of fan structure that forms the backdrop for the scenes in which Belfiore is accused of his crime and begins to fall into madness--nothing about this setting creates an atmosphere that would support what he is expressing. The grotto scene is simply a dark, empty stage, and when the light comes on we again see the doors in the yellow wall. At the end of the Act II finale, Sandrina and Belfiore, both fallen into madness, roll about on the stage embracing each other; I found the contrast between their singing--the music is marvelous here--and their ridiculous postures, slightly off-putting. The doors remain for Act III and their final duet, ""Tu me lasci,"" another breath-taking musical moment, is marred by this absurd and inappropriate background. And at the very end all the characters, including Sandrina and Belfiore, return to doorways. Perhaps this repeat of the opening image is intended to suggest that the characters are artificial cutout figures, acting from involuntary emotions, cast unchangeably in their roles. But Sandrina is not artificial and Belfiore eventually changes. Nicholas Till in his excellent study of Mozart's operas, ""Mozart and the Enlightenment"", has a more generous evaluation of the characterization, viewing characters' status as caricatures as a positive quality. He says the plot is Shakespearean and belongs to the abundant stream of Pamela plots--virtuous maiden in distress--that followed publication of Richardson's novel. La Finta Giardiniera needs to be understood in the context of the emergent bourgeois culture of the times that was discovering individual feelings as a sound basis for morality (as opposed to Church or State), expressed in art as an ""aesthetics of sensibility."" The heroine of this opera is ""quick to lay claim to the independent authority and dignity"" of her feelings and is ""one of the finest examples of operatic sensibility."" I think the staging of this production insufficiently supports this. True, her first aria (it should be her second, but the first is omitted) is sung in a circle of white light that highlights the sincerity of her feelings. But in the final doorway image she is one among the others. Till also singles out Ramiro as different from the others in retaining his integrity; his arias are heartfelt and noble. But in this production he rather ignobly strikes out at Arminda at the end.

But to return to the settings, a basic theme of this opera is the opposition between nature and artifice. The libretto indicates that the setting for Act I and the end of Act III is a garden: the garden functions importantly in opposition to the wilderness of the grotto, and it represents--at the outset--social artifice, and--at the end--the reintegration of nature and society. The doorways, fan device, and empty stage in the grotto scene--none are adequate to this theme. A garden setting is integral to the plot of La Finta Giardiniera. Productions that dispense with the garden (and it appears that many do so) lose the atmosphere essential for conveying this theme.

Mozart's gorgeous music makes this DVD worth watching, notwithstanding my review of the staging. There are no extras.",1237420800,7,5350,5.180346820809248

My set design is very different in that I included another fully visible room in the main set (i.e., the set is a 2-room apartment) and a street scene so that the audience sees ALL of the action.
