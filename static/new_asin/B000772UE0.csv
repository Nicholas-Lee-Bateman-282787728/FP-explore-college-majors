8045306,5,B000772UE0,"I've seen this film many many times and every time it leaves me wipping my tears, inspired by this great, almost impossible love, and moved with the story itself, the music, the characters, all of it! This is truly a masterpiece.",1313539200,2,229,4.609756097560975
8045307,5,B000772UE0,"I have seen this movie many times in my life. It has never failed to upset my soul to tears. it is one of the best stories ever told of love, passion, madness...and gypsy way of life. The imagery is plainly stunning, some would say you have to have a soul born to those parts to fully appreciate it but I say eveyone will be better off after watching this, even only once. I warmly recommend this, you won't regret it and will be changed for the rest of your life.",1235088000,2,464,4.1098901098901095

8045309,5,B000772UE0,"At the beginning there is a caution and warning stating that the movie is not to be sold or viewed in any former soviet republics. I find that quite interesting. I watched it with the English dubbing AND the English subtitles. The two only occasionally match. In general, I found the subtitles likely a ""better"" translation than the dubbing. Someone who knows Russion would have to verify that.

The movie was made in 1976 - the height of the Cold War but some decades distant from the mass slaughter of gypsies in the concentration camps during WWII. The exact location I am unsure about. There is much discussion of crossing various rivers and mountains - the Caucuses? I'm thinking the location is somewhere east of Romania - maybe Moldavia, Bessarabia, or the Ukraine - or whatever those areas were around 1900 - when the movie takes place.

Once it gets past the big statue of Lenin in the opening credits, the movie is quite good. I do not know how much of the gypsy activity is folklore and how much is fact. The gypsy men are humorous or romantic, thieves and scoundrels, loyal brothers and kinsmen - many sporting droopy moustaches or big bushy beards and long hair that go with their loose shirts and very large leather belts. They steal horses, drink, dance, and chase women. The women are beautiful with long, dark beribboned and becoined hair, colorful scarves, vast numbers of skirts, and the bare midriffs. Everyone smokes pipes and laughs and dances. There is gypsy fortune telling, gypsy magic healing with moondust, gypsy dancing, and gypsy singing.

Rada and Zobar are star-crossed lovers but there are also other romantic themes in the movie. I wish we had gotten to know more about Rada's taciturn, scarred father who rather resembles Captain Nemo in the Disney movie - or Zobar's spirited sister. Or the blonde girl who tells Zobar she is his ""wheatfield that he harvests but once a year.""

Lots of good stuff here for folklorists, belly dancers, ethnic musicians, and anyone else with a soft spot for gypsies in their hearts.",1200355200,6,2048,4.77683615819209
8045310,5,B000772UE0,This movie is absolutely amazing! A beautiful love story intertwined with passionate gypsy music and songs. Not one of the typical love stories.,1152576000,6,144,5.304347826086956
8045311,5,B000772UE0,"a great russian film, almost a musical, that shows a way of life rather than one story. gypsies are described amazingly well, the costumes are inspiring and the music is fantastic.

it could be defined a russian 'HAIR'

-a rare pearl of russian filmography",1123027200,11,256,4.795454545454546
8045312,5,B000772UE0,"I have seen the film and i was very happy ,because the gypsy love never dies, it is forever. i wish everybody to see the film, it is good for everyone.",1112486400,8,151,3.903225806451613
