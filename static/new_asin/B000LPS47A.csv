8163224,1,B000LPS47A,piece of crap movie. DON'T waste your money,1427414400,,43,4.5
8163225,3,B000LPS47A,The movie wasn't bad but could have been better. If you like indi-films then you will really enjoy this flic.,1356220800,,109,4.5
8163226,3,B000LPS47A,Lacey Chabert was the only reason this movie was purchased. That one scene wasn't the only good thing about this movie.,1356048000,,119,4.714285714285714
8163227,4,B000LPS47A,"This is an off-the-wall story that is mostly entertaining for its character studies. The actors have fun with their parts and I enjoyed watching them do so. Basically the story is about the kidnapping of a cult figure (a young woman) and we follow as disconnected characters converge. The movie got poor reviews, from those reviewers who bothered to watch it at all, but I think it's a gem if you take it for what it offers. It's definitely under-rated.",1301443200,,453,4.675
8163228,2,B000LPS47A,"At first glance,I truly believed that The Pleasure Drivers would be a solid work of cinema...I mean,it's directed by Andrzej Sekula,Tarantinos' cinematographer for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,which nearly 20 years and several films later are still considered by many to be Tarantinos' greatest works. Maybe he and ""writer"" Adam Haynes have given us at least a 3 star film,hmm?

Nnnnnnnope.

Sekula successfully replicates his great,unique style of cinematography we first saw those many years ago. I won't try to take that away from him,because I can't...he is truly gifted in that aspect (watch 2009's ""Armored"").But between him and the truly incompetent ""writer"" Adam Haynes,the film comes across as a bad attempt at ripping off QT's knack for organic,original,realistic,smoooth,insert-more-positive-adjectives-here dialogue and direction. In trying to cop QT's ""different stories that intertwine"" theme from Pulp Fiction,Haynes instead produces incoherent plots,clumsy dialogue and senseless twists,such as the Wordless Lesbian Assassin/Sodomizer (yeah,you read right).In a nutshell,it's the kind of movie that would have been perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

As disjointed and unfocused as it is,the cast and (some of) the acting is strong...they just weren't working with a script that could make the most of their talents. As the other critics here have said,Lacey Chabert's performance was particularly strong. Seeing her as a wise-beyond-her-years child in Party of Five,a high school ditz in Mean Girls,and now a very convincing seductive siren/prostitute in The Pleasure Drivers serves to prove her versatility and talent as an actress. Meat Loaf does what he can with what little role he has...a trailer dwelling drug addled hepatitis sufferer...and does it pretty well. Angus McFayden is definitely solid as a paranoid college professor with a crumbling marriage and an Oedipal complex,who hits the road with Chaberts' character. Lauren Holly and Angelo Spizzirri fall behind as a caretaker and the mentally afflicted man under her care,which is not to say they are not talented...again,they weren't working with much in Haynes' script.

Sekula might actually be a good director...you just can't quite tell since he was directing a good cast that had a subpar script. Too bad.",1295049600,,2302,5.60632183908046
8163229,2,B000LPS47A,"The first half of this movie is well-done: good acting, good direction, surprising dialogue and surprising changes of fortune.  The movie fell apart for me midway through when two of the main characters get into an argument following an unconsummated adult encounter in a hotel room.  Their argument is bitter, nearly endless, and makes you dislike the more spiteful of the two characters intensely.

The first half of the movie balances entertainment and realism well.  The second half of the movie loses the balance and is a chore to watch, primarily as one of the main characters, a college instructor, becomes whining, depressive, and intolerable.",1230854400,3,651,5.171428571428572
8163230,1,B000LPS47A,"Three seperate stories seemingly unconnected all come together in this delightfully awful rat crap of a movie.  Decent names make up the cast... but this is a prime example of instead of getting a nice casserole, where the cast meshes well with each other, you get peanut butter on steak with brussel spouts rinse with listerine and chase down with orange juice.

Billy Zane is completely useless as the preacher's lieutenant.  Lauren Holly... I have no idea... she's definitely trashy.. but the performance is still crap... she looked like she wanted to jump MeatLoaf's bones in the trailer... which was equally creepy.  Angus has gotten waaaay FAT.  He was a sad mix of Dr. Frasier Crane and Jeff Goldblum.(Jurassic/Independence Day performances)  All the vocabulary and idiosyncracies of both and none of the positive attributes.  What a crap character.  The single redeeming performance of this movie was Lacey Chabert.  Her character was a simple, one dimensional slut, and she played it really well.  (Smokin' bod didn't hurt either) All the other performances were completely forgettable.  The story is, at best, unfinished and more accurately hap-hazard and lame.  1 star, and that primarily goes Lacey's performance.  I've been subjected to worse.",1177891200,5,1256,5.251256281407035
8163231,5,B000LPS47A,"This movie is off the planet! I watched it twice the first time I saw it.  Lacey Chabert is sooo dirty in this movie. She snorts coke in a car and screams  ""I'm so wet! I'm so wet!"" as she prepares to golden shower the seat. And that's before she starts getting really raunchy at the Big Cock Inn, complete with giant plaster rooster. Lacey Chabert was the best thing in Mean Girls and this is her best movie yet. This movie has lesbians, cults, lesbians, drugs, lesbians with guns, Meatloaf with drugs and a gas station where the clerks are Debbie Downer and Jay from Clerks. I'm not returning this to the video store until my own copy arrives in the mail. Whoever thought this up must be smoking the same crack that Lauren Holly smokes in this amazing movie.",1174867200,3,760,4.382978723404255
8163232,4,B000LPS47A,"You can see Andrzej Sekula's presence. I enjoyed the familar faces in this somewhat twisted film. Is it worth watching? Yes, I enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to more movies from these folks. Someday I would like to meet Meatloaf.",1174780800,,230,4.775
8163233,4,B000LPS47A,"I rented this and i liked it it was a good movie , acting was not bad . did not look low budget. i would recommened this movie.",1173916800,3,127,3.5714285714285716
