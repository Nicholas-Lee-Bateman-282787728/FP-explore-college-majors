8142859,5,B000I0RNWK,"Uponreading the reviews of other consumers I was troubled by the numerous negative comments that were made. First these were obviously written by film goers that are not classic western film lovers. If they were, they would recognize that no matter how you feel about colorization, these ARE true western classics. Also I must add that Legend Films does an excellent job at mastering the art of restoring these films so that they live on for years. I believe this John Wayne 3 pack deserved a 5 star rating.",1396137600,,507,4.707865168539326
8142860,1,B000I0RNWK,"There are numerous John Wayne collections that are using bogus titles that make you think you are missing some of John Wayne's films from your collection. Be advised, these titles (An Innocent Man, Cold Vengeance, Gold Strike River, Guns Along the Trail, Stagecoach Run, Stolen Goods) ARE NOT TITLES OF JOHN WAYNE MOVIES! Check the internet movie data base (IMDB.com).

Some people have noted that these are colorized versions of other film titles, if that's the case, why the dishonesty?",1288483200,,488,5.1
8142861,3,B000I0RNWK,"I've said this before and I'll say it again: Colorization is NOT evil if it induces someone to watch (or better yet, buy) something they would not otherwise have been inclined to, and more often than not that diversion from their sheltered ways will benefit them -whether artistically, culturally or whatever.

I remember the films in this set when they were released nearly a decade ago on the Nelvana Tech/UAV label as part of The Young Duke Series (you can still find them under the titles The Fugitve and Rodeo Racketeers).
Nelvana Tech was a pioneer at re-cycling and colorizing otherwise un-marketable black and white product and at least breathing some life into them. Once they caught on they also scored a hit with an unfortunately short-lived but pure genius idea of doing the same thing with old science fiction B-movies of the 50's and releasing them to TV (I've never been able to find a DVD of them, but I'm hoping) as Attack of the Killer B's.

It would appear that Legend Films has aquired them and worked their magic on them and again released them under still different titles. Purists will attack the re-editing, colorizing and sound mixing, but even the most dispassionate bystander will have to admit that after 70 years or so, these films were desperately in need of a makeover. I've seen the unaltered versions and they creak badly. The re-edited versions tightened the plot, added some visual interest by way of color and the new soundtracks punched up the dead spots (though the new voice-overs seemed a bit jarring).

I want to repeat again that colorization is NOT a bad thing, particularly if (as Legend does) the original version is also made available. They also go the extra step and include bonus material rather generously.

Legend Films is NOT the old comic book/crayon style colization we all know and hate. The advances in computer and digital technology are literally night-and-day from what they were in the 80's ad in some instances -like in some of the Stooges shorts- it is almost impossible to tell that the films were not originally filmed in color.

No less respected a director that Martin Scorcese (himself an outspoken critic of colorization) has not only praised Legend Films for their efforts, but he has used them -most notably in The Aviator. Special effects maestro Ray Hattyhausen has championed and supported them as he personally supervised their colorization of his own films.

I welcome and applaud Legend Films for breathing life into old films and regret only that the condition of the public domain prints they use limits them from achieving their full potential.",1180310400,6,2623,4.896396396396397

8142863,2,B000I0RNWK,"Ok Lets cut the crap, this is just another rerelease of older movies that they think colorizing makes it sale again. This is a walmart 5.50 bin item that has the duke which of course is nice it is in no way worth more than 10 bucks colorized or not.

Blue steel and mclintock are the 2 most rereleased john wayne fans of all time.

here it comes again blue steel. lol i have this one in 5 different sets.

the lucky texan again

sagebrush trail again

the only reason to buy this set is if u don't already own them or are the kind of collector that must have every think john wayne on dvd.

in closing the quality is subpar if you like to see what they can do with older movies check out errol flynns robin hood or the james bond ultimate collections. these are B movies no amount of tricks is gonna change that in interviews duke himself thought these movies weren't the best.

beware this is false advertising and amazon themselves should ad in subtext under the names the real names of these films",1167955200,15,1000,4.2592592592592595
8142864,2,B000I0RNWK,"The three John Wayne movies in this DVD set are not newly discovered John Wayne films, but rather are a trio of public domain films which Legend has renamed, edited slightly, and added music and sound effects in addition to color.  The actual films included in this set are BLUE STEEL, THE LUCKY TEXAN and SAGEBRUSH TRAIL.  These discs have special features which are all nearly identical on each disc in the set.  The only differences are thet the Featurette will be different.

In all fairness the BW verison of the film have been cleaned up a bit.  The color versions are not as good as prior Legends films releases, as an example see any of the Shirley Temple films which have been colorized.  I am not a fan of someone altering with someone elses work, especially when it comes to editing and adding music and sound effects.  These three films have menacing music playing throughout the films, which very quickly becomes annoying.",1167436800,26,935,4.699386503067485
8142865,3,B000I0RNWK,"I have enjoyed a few other colorized films that Legend's Films has released over the last few years.  Two that especially stand out are 'My Man Godfrey' and 'Terror By Night'.  If you didn't know those two were originally filmed in black and white, you would never know the difference.

Here in lies the problem with this set.  Knowing Legend's past record with colorization, when an average job is done on one of their releases, it becomes that much more obvious.  To this viewer's eye, it appears that Legend Films has re-done the opening credits and closing title card (which look outstanding, by the way), but have substituted in the previously released colorized versions of these films.  The techonlogy used here seems to be the same type used by Ted Turner 20 years ago.  The colors are drab and dull...just like how the VHS releases of these Lone Star films were, back in the late 80s.

Now, for the positive parts....This set includes some very good extras (the two skits with Jimmy Durante are especially funny).  There is also a new soundtrack laid on top of the original one, that is not intrusive or over-bearing.  As a matter of fact, the storm at the beginning of Blue Steel comes crashing out of the speakers.

In summary, I will recommend this set, but if your looking for the normal quality work that Legend Films usually puts into it's product, you'll be somewhat disappointed with these.",1166659200,,1407,4.725409836065574
