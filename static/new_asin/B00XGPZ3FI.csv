7167601,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"This is an excellent DVD for my race training, and overall balance and focus.  I started running less than 2 years ago, and this DVD helped me push past the plateau during training and get to my goal for race day.  I use this DVD even outside of my training to maintain the balance and focus which helps fend off recurring back pain.  It's easy to follow, helps me focus while at the same time reducing tension and letting go of stress.",1435795200,2,436,4.2926829268292686
7167602,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"This DVD is a great tool to incorporate in your triathlon training and recovery. There are two segments, a short recovery sequence and a longer program. I use the DVD once or twice a week by completing either the short recovery sequence after a workout or the long program on a rest day. I've been a triathlete for 10 years and this DVD has helped to relieve the nagging trouble areas from training like stiffness in the neck, shoulders and back. I don't have much experience with yoga, so I appreciate the instructor's clear directions as well as the high quality video.",1432771200,4,571,4.607843137254902
8715856,1,B00XGPZ3FI,"Very elementary Yoga.  If you've done yoga before and want something specific for Triathletes, you'll be disappointed.  Maybe good for someone new to yoga.",1464134400,,155,5.416666666666667
8715857,3,B00XGPZ3FI,"I bought this disc for my fiance who is a triathlete. He also loves yoga. While he did like the routines, his biggest complaint is that every class or segment requires you to use a wall. The instructor apparently loves walls. Unfortunately the way our living room is laid out, there is no wall that you can use and see the tv at the same time. The overuse of walls also makes it a poor choice to take when traveling since most hotel rooms (at least the ones I've been in) don't have much open space and also have the same trouble with seeing the tv from the floor. If you have easy access to a wall, it's a great disc. If you don't or if you don't care for looking at the tv upside down, I would suggest some other yoga discs.",1456617600,3,726,4.083916083916084
8715858,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"Having completed my first triathlon series with a team, I'm taking a break from the team and training on my own. I used to do yoga frequently, but haven't kept my practice up in the last several years. I was looking for a dvd that's specifically geared toward triathletes and purchased 3. This is my favourite for a couple of reasons. It's a very restorative practice. The instructor moves slowly enough through the poses that she's easy to keep up with. She describes and uses poses that help triathletes open up their shoulders for swimming, hips for the bike and run, and many other benefits. As a bonus, if you're short on time, there is a shorter practice. I do it after a speed to help with recovery. Highly recommend it!",1450310400,3,727,4.557251908396947
8715859,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"As a tightly wound runner, this DVD is becoming a vital part of my post run recovery regimen.  In addition, as I get older, it becomes even more important that I adhere to the great instruction in the video in order to battle the constrictions father time tries to impose upon my body.",1438732800,,285,4.377358490566038
8715860,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"What a nice change! I've bought many yoga DVDs (Rodney yee and a bunch of other Gaiam ones); I really loved/appreciated this one more than most because it feels like your at an actual class. It has a meditative pace that most yoga DVDs are missing, but it's a really thorough and restorative practice, especially for an athlete who needs to undo all the pounding and lifting of daily training sessions. So glad to have this one in my nerdy fitness dvd library :)",1437350400,2,462,4.511904761904762
8715861,5,B00XGPZ3FI,My favorite yoga DVD. The instructor has amazing energy and knows what athletes need to stay in the game.,1437350400,,105,4.578947368421052
8715862,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"This DVD is a fantastic addition that any triathlete, at any level, could benefit from incorporating into their training and recovery programs. I particularly enjoy the recovery sequence and find that it helps to alleviate aches and pains associated with my training. Being relatively new to yoga, and not having much experience, I found this video easy to follow along and not at all intimidating for the novice. That being said, even the most advanced in yoga will find this DVD beneficial as it intertwines poses and moves that are challenging yet enjoyable. A must have for any triathlete or for any individual that is seeking to incorporate some inspiration and perspiration into their day.",1436832000,4,695,5.052173913043478
8715863,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"I am a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (A submission grappling sport) competitor, and many of my teammates have incorporated yoga into their training because they say it helps them with their performance and recovery. I tried out a local studio, but with work and training 7 days a week (sometimes twice a day), the last thing I want to do is spend more time away from my dogs (I have 2 Boston terriers).  I came across Yoga for Triathletes while searching online for a yoga routine I could do from home. I decided to give it a try because, in my opinion, triathletes are some of the some best conditioned athletes, along with Wrestlers, Boxers and Submission grappling athletes like myself, so I knew this program would be geared towards athletes with rigorous training regimens.  After a few sessions of Jennifers yoga program, I noticed an improvement in my flexibility (which is extremely important for performance and injury prevention in BJJ), endurance, functional strength, breathing, and I noticed a quicker recovery between workouts.  I seriously felt like I was 18 again. My techniques became more fluid and I stopped getting minor aches and pains associated with intense training.  Also, the breathing patterns used in yoga helped me tremendously in competitions or whenever I would get stuck in a stressful situation by helping stay relaxed and prevent me from expending all of my energy from the adrenaline rush.  In other words, I felt like a machine! If you are a triathlete or any other endurance athlete that is looking for a competitive edge, or just want to include Yoga in your training, I highly recommended giving Yoga for Triathletes a try.  Not only will you notice an improvement in your performance, but you will also prolong your competitive career.",1436486400,5,1765,4.925925925925926

8715865,5,B00XGPZ3FI,"This DVD and the guidance set forth by its teacher is an amazing tool for helping condition your body and mind for the endrance required. The stretching, strengthening and breathing exercises really helped me improve my triathon experience!
Thank you!",1436486400,,251,5.3
