The Four Harmonious Friends is a Bhutanese myth which has been told and retold for generations. In this tale a bird, a rabbit, a monkey, and an elephant find a seed and plant it. The animals all work together to cultivate the seed so that it will grow. In time, it grows into a mighty fruit tree, but now the animals cannot reach the fruit unless they work together to form a pyramid, and in this way they are able to reach the fruit. The fable exemplifies the inseparable link between religion and the natural environment in Bhutan, which is the theme that is explored in The Last Shangri-La.

The concept of harmonious coexistence is carried throughout The Last Shangri-La as the art, culture and lifestyle of the Bhutanese people are portrayed according to their relationship with the environment. Many examples are offered which demonstrate the Bhutanese philosophy of peaceful coexistence. For instance, in the Buddhist religion the souls of humans and animals are linked, and if people wish to ascend to a higher level during their next incarnation upon this earth, they must be respectful of the environment. Consequently, hunting is illegal. Killing a crane is worth life in prison, and killing a raven is as serious an offense as killing one hundred monks. They believe that nothing is permanent, that change is part of life, and that like the seasons, all things are made new through reincarnation.

Like the subject matter, this video has a relaxed and peaceful tone. The natural scenery is breathtaking. The music selections are natural and soft and add to the harmonious mood. Overall, this was an informative and interesting documentary which explored the unity between man and nature in the kingdom of Bhutan.",1261958400,,1753,4.95578231292517
