I prefer having normal sized blu-ray cases in my collection, so it was nice to see that the Ice Age Trilogy box is just an outer cover with 3 individual blu-ray cases inside. Picture quality and sound are good. Overall this set contains 3 fun animated movies that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.",1393718400,3,441,4.390243902439025

3960230,3,B002NU67U2,I found the first two boring except for one character that had about five to ten minutes per movie. The third movie once pretty funny and worth having.,1357430400,,151,4.428571428571429

I don't have a BR player and have no plans to get one in the near future, my DVDs play just fine for a lot lower price. Guess I'll end up having to buy these separately, even though I prefer boxed sets for my collection. They usually release sets in both DVD & BR but not this time.

3960250,5,B002NU67U2,"OK, when Ice Age hit the theaters I was like ""who cares, it looks stupid""....

Well I'm glad to say I was so so so WRONG!

I rented Ice Age at Netflix and loved it so much I put both the 2nd and 3rd in my queue at Netflix and just finished watching the 3rd one.

Well the 2nd one wasn't as funny as the 1st but it was good and Queen Latifah doing the voice of Elli was just wonderful and it really set the stage for Ice Age 3.

Ice Age 3.... what can I say. One of THE most enjoyable, funny and visually stunning 3d animations I've seen so far. If you haven't seen this yet I HIGHLY recommend it. If I can find the Ice Age movies in a boxed set I'm getting it for sure as I plan on watching many many more times. It's a feel good kinda movie and it's funny as hell. The humor is so outrageous at times it's just unbelievable to me how someone could be that insane to come up with some of the stuff they pull off. The great thing about it is it's no holds bar with the animation, esp the physical humor.

So now I see all three Blu-Ray versions here at Amazon.com.  Into the cart the go.  Yea, totally worth every penny!!  Amazing, funny and very very enjoyable!!",1262476800,2,1162,3.9570815450643777

3960253,4,B002NU67U2,"Thank you all on this page for getting the price of this BLU RAY Box Set down & Finally i think its fair & if you liked all the 3 ICE AGE movies so far, don't hesitate to enjoy it in this crystal clear format.
personally I enjoyed ICE AGE 3 the most & was hoping to see it in the 3D format in which it was made & probably best enjoyed.(Hence the less one star for this review)
However I do not intend to wait forever till someone decides to release the 3D version so I guess i'll just be happy with this set.",1256169600,5,508,3.8476190476190477
