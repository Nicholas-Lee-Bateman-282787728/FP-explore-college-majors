I stayed in the lodge but this film maker had to follow them into the wild for a year. It is sad that some 70% of the moose calves do not survive and there is over 60% reduction in moose population. This beautiful documentary was produced in Canada's largest park, Jasper Nation Park in the Canadian Rockies. You will appreciate moose much more after this documentary. What a nice get away. Bravo.",1455753600,3,516,4.559139784946237
