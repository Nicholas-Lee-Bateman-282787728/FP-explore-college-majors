7906009,5,B00000EZVR,"This is a 3 video set. They are recorded in SP mode. These are very funny. The first is Abbott & Costello and features some of their routines. It is 60 minutes and is in color and B&W. The second video is Private Snafu. After the start of World War II Hollywood's Warner Brothers film studio linked up writer Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss!) and Phil Eastman along with Bugs Bunny director Chuck Jones to create the hilarious, Private SNAFU (Situation Normal All Fouled Up). This was risque' stuff for the time and the cartoons carried the reminder that ""sometimes the GI language can be a little salty!""! 30 minutes B&W. The third video is Bob Hope: War Time. This is from Hope's wonderful time visiting our troops with Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Betty Hutton and many more with some of his ""Strictly GI"" shows. 44 minutes B&W.",1052265600,,819,4.578231292517007
