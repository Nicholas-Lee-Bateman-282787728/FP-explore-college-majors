3512055,5,B001CEK0M6,"I'm not sure what it is about Shushybye but my 11 month old daughter loves it.  Many a night when it's bed time our little one will still be wide awake with so much energy.  When we pop on Shushybye though, for some reason she calms right down (within seconds) and just seems to be mesmerized by the Shushybye characters and music.  Soon thereafter she'll fall asleep.  We can even show this to her during the day and she enters that peaceful sort of trance but we save it mainly for bed time evenings.",1245628800,3,502,4.308510638297872

8287459,5,B001CEK0M6,"This DVD is a lifesaver for parents. My 2 year old son ADORES the shushies, and to be honest, I like them too.  The songs are catchy. We have the CD as well and I find myself singing the songs often. If I need to run to the restroom without a freak out, this DVD is the answer!!!",1355788800,,279,3.810344827586207
8287460,5,B001CEK0M6,"""Shushybye Baby"" is a staple in our home. I don't let my 5-month-old watch too much television, but I turn on Baby First before bed time and she watches ""Sandman,"" ""Harry the Bunny,"" and ""Shushybye Baby."" By the end of ""Shushybye,"" she's usually calm and relaxed and ready for the rest of our bedtime routine. I bought this DVD after seeing how much she loved the show, and it's been a lifesaver more than once. At 4 months, my daughter developed severe stranger anxiety, and even her own Granny was not immune to her meltdowns. If I put on the ""Shushybye Baby"" DVD, she remains calm enough to allow her Granny to hold her. It's not effective 100% of the time, but it's good enough for me. It keeps her calm in the car as well; she can see it in her mirror and hear the songs, which has been great on long-ish car trips. I highly recommend this DVD.",1344902400,2,849,4.3125
8287461,5,B001CEK0M6,"this show comes on baby first tv and my son LOVES it! so we decided to get him this dvd so he can watch it whenever. its a great little show with very well written and sung songs. the graphics are dated yes but he loves this so much the music makes up for it, you'll find yourself singing along soon enough!",1331078400,2,307,3.967741935483871

When my baby is full of energy, bored, noisy, whatever, when she is driving me crazy and I have a lot of things to do or just wanna rest a minute, all I have to do is play Baby's First TV DVD to her. We were travelling by car and she got very stressed after a while so we played the DVD and she were ok for the rest of the travel, it was a bless!",1286928000,4,397,3.6823529411764704
