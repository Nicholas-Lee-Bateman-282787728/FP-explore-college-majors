8359082,5,B002A8R4HM,"Countesses in midwest America catching the attention of the district attorney may seems implausible, but this is a romantic drama. And it's a wonderful flick where Pola Negri shines as a master of emotion. A great addition to any silent film collector's library.",1459296000,2,262,5.116279069767442

This film exposes small minds without being cruel.  She was fine as the exotic femme fatale in this Lady of the World comes to Smalltown, USA.  The timing & film editing were just perfect.  The scene where she is notified by the local sheriff that loose women are not welcome in the small town where she is looking to find her cousin is a gem!  Pola Negri was wonderful!",1281312000,9,559,5.851851851851852
