3144222,4,B000N2HDEQ,"ECW Champion CM Punk vs. John Morrison vs. The Miz - Well, just like most triple threat matches...this was non-stop action from start to finish with neither men looking weak & all looking strong. Good fast paced opener.

Mickie James, Maria, Torrie Wilson, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Phoenix, Melina, Victoria, Layla, Jillian Hall - Well Melina was the MVP of this match as before the match even begins, you get a special treat as Melina couldn't help but laugh at herself for messing up her entrance. Then towards the end, she gets the ""kiss of death"" from Mickie James before losing. The rest of the match was nice as the girls who normally can't wrestle good was able to get their moments in & nobody looked like a weak link in this one.

World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock vs. Cody Rhodes & Hardcore Holly - Cade & Murdock kept their classic tag team wrestling in tact as they kept with the quick tags & keeping Holly away from his corner thoughout most of the match with it ending with Trevor Murdock's ""Code Red"" flip piledriver. Cade & Murdock carried the match while Holly & Rhodes didn't look weak either. Average & watchable match.

Elimination Match: Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, Kane vs. Umaga, Big Daddy V, Finlay, MVP, Mr. Kennedy - With Matt Hardy being injured again, this was a handicap match from the start & remained that way in the opening minutes as both Kane & Mysterio were eliminated leaving HHH & Hardy to defy the odds. The eliminations of the other team came quickly & settled down when it got to two against two. The match got real good at the end while the rest as enjoyable.

Hornswoggle vs. Great Khali - Let's just say that the most entertaining part of this was the crowd chanting for Shaq who was sitting in the audience. This wasn't funny or entertaining at all. I've never been so happy to see Finlay in my life because that ment this segment was over. Press skip on this one.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels - If Orton got disqualifed, he would lose the title but if HBK uses ""sweet chin music"" then he'll lose the match & never get another title shot. This match basically revolved around HBK trying other manuevers to beat Orton since he couldn't use the superkick & had to stop himself from using it various times. The real highlights were the submission moves HBK pulled out like the sharpshooter (HAPPY ANNIVERSARY ""MONTREAL""), the anklelock and THE CRIPPLER CROSSFACE! The match itself was solid like their previous match at Cyber Sunday.

Hell In A Cell: World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker - Just like their entire series of matches, this was an awesome encounter. It wasn't on the level as Batista's last HITC match with Triple H but still a great performance from both men. Spots involving a table & the ringsteps would happen at times but besides that, it was straight Taker & Batista until the end when Edge interfeared & cost Taker the title match. Again, awesome match.

DVD extras include the revealing of ""Save_Us"" the next night on RAW...which was the return of Chris Jericho.

Overall, I enjoyed this Survivor Series more than last years & this was one of the best PPV's to come from WWE in 2007...and there wasn't a whole lot of them. The only ""skip it"" moment was really the Hornswoggle segment. I recommend as I feel this was WWE's best PPV this year.",1199318400,3,3360,4.597662771285476

1. CMP vs. The Miz vs. John Morisson for the ECW Title- This was probably the best ECW title match I have seen in almost a year. The only problem I had with this was they only gave it 8 minutes but with what they were given they did a awesome job. There were so many unique counters including a hurricanrana into a powerbomb. So much nice fast pace action and this was a pleasure to watch. I would not mind seeing a rematch that would be a little bit longer. Winner and still ECW Champ CMP. Match Rating 8/10.
2. Beth Phoenix, Layla, Victoria, Melina and  Michelle McCool vs. Mickie James, Candice Michelle, Torrie Wilson, Kelly Kelly  and Maria  in a ten Womens tag Team Match- This was an okay match. I was not expecting much going into this match but I got more than I was expecting. I wish that Mickie James would be back in the title picture cause she is one of the best. A decent filler match. Match Rating 6/10,
3. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs. Cody Rodes and Hardcore Holly for the World Tag Team Titles- This was an okay match and seemed like it was juust thrown on the card. I like the fued kind of setting up between cody rodes and hardcore holly as you can see holly turning on rodes in the future. This was just an average tag match with most of the energy coming from cody rodes. Not much to say but just a average tag match. Winners and still world tag team champs lance cade and Trevor murdoch. Match Rating 6.5/10.
4. Jeff Hardy, HHH, Kane and rey meysterio vs. Big Daddy V, Umaga, Finlay, MVP, Mr. Kennedy in a survivor series handicap elimination tag match- This was supposed to be a 5 on 5 survivor series tag team match but  matt hardy was taken out before the match started. This was better than the tag match last year but still wasn't near what the years past have been. It was solid tag team wrestling with tons of feuds coming into the match. The eliminations were timed right but the only problem I had with the match was I knew that HHH team was going to win. Still an enjoyable match and one to defiantly check out. Winners HHH and Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 8/10.
5. The Great Kalhi vs. Hornswoggle- This match was terriable. I first off don't understand why this took place as it was not needed on the vard and in fact I don tink that I can call this a match. It wasted so much time of the ppv and I don't think it is going anywere. The match ended in a dq to make matters worse and was just not needed on the ppv. Skip this match. Winner by DQ The Great Kalhi. Match Rating 2/10.
6. Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels for the wwe title- This was better than there cyber Sunday match as there was no crapy ending. The match rules were if shawn michales used the super kick than he would be DQ but if orton got dq he would lose the wwe title. Very interesting and it did not hurt the match that much at all. First off Michales continues to amaze me that he can still wrestle and there were tons of spots during the match were I thought orton was going to tap out when Michaels choked in the crossface, ankle lock and the sharpshooter. Just so many back and forth finishes and a match that I really enjoyed. Very good match. Winner and still wwe champ randy orton. Match Rating 9/10.
7. Batistia vs. The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match- Every time these two get together I think they might not live up to there previous match but every time I am wrong. These two guys work so well together and this match was very brutal. There were all sorts of weapons from steel steps to steel chairs to even tables. This match was very bloody and was given the time to develop. There were the usual near falls but when undertaker hit the first tombstone I thought the match was over but even batistia kicked out of that. When he hit it on the steel steps I thought it was over again but than Edge made his shocking return. He cost taker the title and it was a very interesting ending to a good ppv. Winner and still World Heavyweight Champ Batistia. Match Rating 9/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give wwe survivor series 2007 a grade of  48.5/70 which is a 69% which means this is a good ppv. I will actually give this ppv 5 stars and call it awesome cause if you disclude the Great Kalhi match this ppv is easily awesome. Like I said a very good ppv and you should definitely pick this dvd up when it comes out. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that.

Triple Threat Match
ECW Championship match
CM Punk vs. The Mizz vs. Jon Morrison

They do it again. They put the ECW championship match first. Minis that this was an okay way to start the show. You'll see some double teaming in the beginning but changes towards the middle of the match. Punk does some very good moves and he made the match worth watching. There comes a point in the match were punk does a super hurricane to Morrison and Mizz does a powerbomb to him. Overall 6/10

10 diva tag match
Beth Phoenix, Layla, Jillian, Victoria, and Melina vs. Maria, Torrie, Mickie James, Michelle McCool, and Kelly Kelly

Watch out for Melina's slip when she splits her legs but she'll do it again for the audience. Pretty much this was a short match. I didn't like seeing Layla out in the match because she looks horrible in their. The only part I liked was when Mickie kissed Melina towards the end. Overall 4/10

Tag Team match
World Tag Team championship match
Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs. Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes?

I would of liked to see a fatal four way match also with The Highlanders and Paul London and Brian Kendricks but oh well. This was an average match. Just an back and forth match that felt really boring. I liked that move that Murdoch did to Rhodes. Overall 6/10

Survivor Series Match
Triple H, Kane, Jeff Hardy, and Rey Misterio vs. MVP, Umaga, Big Daddy V, Finlay, and Mr. Kennedy

Matt Hardy is injured with a bad knee so its four against five. Before the match Team Triple H cut a funny interview when Jeff and Kane was talking about the bad things H did to them. I was very entertained with this match. I was king of shocked with the reaction towards MVP seeing that he's from Miami. When you thought it that someone was going to be eliminated you were wrong. They kept it very fun and long enough to watch. Overall 10/10

The Great Khali vs. Hornswaggle

What can I say about this match, wait a minute this wasn't a match at all. The fans chanted for Shaq to get in the ring to fight Great Khali but never happened. Khali hits him on his head and Finlay comes out to help Hornswaggle . 0/10

WWE Championship match
Shawn Micheals vs. Randy Orton

This was a good technical match. Shawn does some moves that you wouldn't see coming. Like the sharpshooter, the ankle lock, And the crossface. They kept it at a nice pace and picked up towards the end. Very entertaining. Overall 10/10

Hell in a Cell
World Heavyweight match
Batista vs. The Undertaker

This was a slow match but a very nice match. There was lots of blood in this one. There wasn't that many weapons only a chair, steel steps, and a table. I really thought that The Undertaker would win when he hit Batista with the tombstone piledriver on the steel steps but no. Guess who ruined it all. Edge. He gave Undertaker a con chairtor to him a slided Batista on him for the win. Overall 10/10

Overall this was a good ppv with the surprise of Edge.",1195344000,3,3047,4.416071428571429

8258129,4,B000N2HDEQ,"Triple Threat ECW Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. John Morrison vs. The Miz
A great opener and very well done and memorable match! The Miz has improved significantly from Cyber Sunday, though he still messes up a bit and causes some unneeded damage to John Morrison. I'm growing to dislike CM Punk with every match I see him in as many of his signature moves are just rather boring and he basically relies on them for his matches to be successful. Regardless, the match was fast-paced, with Miz and Morrison double-teaming Punk for a large part of the contest, but Miz ended up betraying Morrison, with whom he held the WWE Tag Team Championship with that the time, by dumping him over the top rope. There was a lot of shots to the face by Punk with kicks and stuff, with a particularly hard shot to Miz's jaw at one point. Morrison performed a breathtaking corkscrew moonsault, which would later be called Starship Pain. One particularly awesome part of the match saw Punk hurracarana Morrison off the top turnbuckle right into a powerbomb by Miz!!! In the end though, Punk went for the Go To Sleep on Morrison, only to have Morrison power out and get on the apron. Miz then pushed Punk into Morrison, but then Miz ended up a victim to the Go To Sleep. The botches and sloppy finish held this match back from true greatness. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 4/5

10-Diva Tag Team Match: Beth Phoenix, Jillian Hall, Layla, Melina, and Victoria vs. Kelly Kelly, Maria, Mickie James, Michelle McCool, and Torrie Wilson
Why they didn't make this an elimination match when it's at FREAKING SURVIVOR SERIES is beyond me, but regardless, it's not as bad as you'd expect. There's some okay wrestling from the Divas, and it's always fun to see Torrie Wilson and Victoria in the ring. Beth Phoenix and Victoria are two actually very talented women wrestlers, and it's a shame that they didn't just get a match together on the card instead of all this nonsense. The ending was surprising, with Mickie James planting a kiss on Melina, kicking her in the head, and then getting the pinfall! A tad boring, but it wasn't necessarily ""bad"". Winners: Kelly Kelly, Maria, Mickie James, Michelle McCool, and Torrie Wilson. Match Rating: 3/5

World Tag Team Championship Match: Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch (Champions) vs. Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes
Wait a second...a Tag Team Championship match on a WWE pay-per-view card? And it's a pretty good one at that, too. There was lots of back-and-forth action, and there were actually chants for Hardcore Holly at one point. Cody Rhodes was particularly impressive after he got the hot tag and hit a flurry of offenise maneuvers. Cade and Murdoch work like a well-oiled machine together, hitting plenty of tag team maneuvers that were rather unique. They combined a big boot and an atomic drop as well as a back suplex and a leg drop. The ending was also very unique and unexpected, with the quite heavy Murdoch hitting a move reminiscent of the TNA X-Division stars where he did a combination of a sunset flip, a powerbomb, and a piledriver on Cody Rhodes for to the pinfall to retain the titles. Winners: Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. Match Rating: 4/5

4-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Match: Team Triple H (Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, and Kane) vs. Team Umaga (Umaga, Mr. Kennedy, MVP, Finlay, and Big Daddy V) (with Matt Striker)
We get a traditional Survivor Series match featuring some of the most talented wrestlers of today, so I really don't see how this match didn't live up to what it should have been. The team's leaders consist of Triple H and Umaga, continuing their feud that had been going on since No Mercy when Mr. McMahon had sent Umaga to demolish The Game. Regardless, the match itself was relatively solid, with back-and-forth action and Rey Mysterio being especially impressive. Mysterio hit the 619 and a modified Seated Senton on Umaga at one point, but it wasn't enough to keep the Samoan Savage down. Kane was the first one eliminated after a stupid elbow drop from Big Daddy V. Big Daddy V did play his part well though and he didn't slow the match down considerably like he usually does. Unfortunately for Triple H's team, Rey Mysterio was the next one eliminated after eating the Samoan Spike from Umaga. The match was definitely in the hands of Umaga's team, and the action went back to back-and-forth altercations with plenty of highlights. MVP ended up getting eliminated after a Twist of Fate from Jeff Hardy, and Triple H dodged an elbow drop from Big Daddy V that accidentally hit Mr. Kennedy, which allowed Triple H to get the cover and eliminate Kennedy. Triple H and Hardy worked together to get rid of Big Daddy V after a double DDT, leaving only Umaga and Finlay left. Finlay and Umaga had surprisingly good chemistry together, though Finlay doesn't really cut it as a heel. Regardless, Finlay and Triple H had a pretty good showing together, but Finlay was eliminated after Triple H powered out of the Celtic Cross and hit the Pedigree. Umaga was then quickly eliminated after Triple H tagged in Jeff Hardy, hit the Pedigree on Umaga, and then Hardy hit the Swanton Bomb to finish off the Samoan Bulldozer and end the match. Winners: Team Triple H. Match Rating: 4/5

Hornswoggle (with Vince and Shane McMahon) vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)
Eh...this is hardly a match. Basically, Khali watches as Hornswoggle mule kicks Ranjin Singh on the outside, and then there's some ""psychology"" as Hornswoggle is terrified of Khali. The crowd was completely against this match, and it ended after Khali blocked a shillelagh shot from Hornswoggle, smacked Hornswoggle in the head, and then was about to lock on a submission hold before Finlay ran out and smacked Khali with a shillelagh. Really? Wow. What a complete waste of time. Winner: The Great Khali. Match Rating: 1/5

Special Stipulations WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels
Here's a classic. The match was actually a grapple fest, something I usually hate, but Orton and Michaels played out their parts so perfectly that it worked. The stipulations were that if Michaels used Sweet Chin Music, he would be disqualified, but if Orton got himself disqualified, then his title would still change hands. Regardless, there was a lot of psychology, with Michaels tricking Orton that he was going to do the Sweet Chin Music multiple times, only to perform other maneuvers on Orton. Both men hit their usual offense, but Michaels was unable to follow up on a Flying Elbow Drop. A springboard moonsault to the outside on Orton towards the beginning of the match was particularly impressive, as was the submissions that sprang up in the middle of the match. Michaels locked in the Sharpshooter, only to have Orton grab the ropes. Michaels then followed this move with the Crossface, which nearly saw Orton tap, but he got his foot on the bottom ropes. At one point, Orton was about to hit the RKO, but he changed his mind and decided to go for the Concussion Punt! Michaels COUNTERED THE PUNT INTO THE ANKLE LOCK!!! I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT ONE!!! Michaels got the leg scissors on Orton, but ORTON POWERED OUT!!! An attempt to lock on the Figure Four Leg Lock was countered by Orton, and then Orton tried the RKO. Michaels countered, but then Michaels almost hit the Sweet Chin Music. Michaels hesitated after he caught himself and Orton hit the RKO out of nowhere for the win!!! A nice, classic match that brought back memories of the Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Bret Hart days of the WWE. Michaels just keeps on bringing new moves to his arsenal as well, and that's always nice to see. Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

Hell in a Cell World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista (Champion) vs. The Undertaker
Another great Hell in a Cell that will go down as one of the best matches of not only 2007, but in the history of professional wrestling. The beginning of the match was spent with a little action that you're used to seeing in a Batista/Undertaker match, but the weapons were brought in pretty quickly after that. There were some nice chair shots on the outside of the ring, but a really sick bump occured when Undertaker placed the chair under Batista's throat and smashed it on top of the steel steps, which caused Batista to bleed from the mouth and a glob of blood flew out of his mouth! There were lots of steel steps shots and there was some basic wrestling back in the ring where they countered one another's finishing moves, including Batista hitting a couple of Spinebusters and Undertaker hitting a Chokeslam and a Last Ride. Batista managed to Batista Bomb Undertaker through a table, but Undertaker STILL kicked out!!! As the match went on, Undertaker hit a Tombstone Piledriver after countering a Batista Bomb attempt onto steel steps, but Batista kicked out!!! Undertaker then hit ANOTHER Tombstone Piledriver, this time on top of the steps, but EDGE PULLED THE REFEREE OUT OF THE RING!!! Edge was disguised as a cameraman the entire time!!! Edge smacked Undertaker in the head with a camera, and then set his head up on the steel steps! Edge hit a CON-CHAIR-TO USING THE STEPS!!! This was all that was needed for Edge to roll Batista on top of Undertaker to get the win!!! Lots of weapons and solid wrestling throughout. Awesome match! Winner: Batista. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS
Great yet again! There were plenty of interesting interviews throughout the entire show, plus there was a hilarious moment backstage with Triple H and his team where Kane and Jeff Hardy remembered all of the crap Triple H has done to them throughout the years. After the Orton/Michaels match, Randy tried to beat up on Michaels some more, but Michaels gave him a Sweet Chin Music to think about. There were some shots of professional athletes including Shaq! Melina botched her entrance, which was pretty funny, and the aftermath of the Hornswoggle/Khali ""match"" was okay. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS
AWESOME!!! I'm only going to say this: SAVE_US.Y2J Very emotionally charging and it serves as great build-up for the next pay-per-view. Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
There was one average match and one terrible match that could hardly be considered a match at all, but besides these two mistakes, the rest of the card was very solid. The last two matches on the card were excellent and worth watching again and again, plus both the backstage shenanigans and the extras were awesome as well and definitely worth the money. Survivor Series 2007 is an awesome event and one of the best pay-per-views of 2007, easily.",1248652800,,10596,4.7984665936473165

8258131,5,B000N2HDEQ,"Survivor Series was a huge ppv of 2007, probably ranked 2 or 3 of the year. survivor series was one of the few ppvs of 2007 worth watching. nonstop satisfaction from beginning to end.

1. Ecw World Championship
Cm Punk vs. The Miz vs. John Morrison
This was a great ecw match. i hated though they aint using the extreme rules stimpulation in their matches, that would have been great in this match to use.this match was very fast paced some 2 on 1 with miz and morrison on cm punk. punk takes some vicious kicks in this one. great match to start off the show it really got the crowd pumped. 4/5

2. 10 woman survivors series match
Mickie James, Maria, Torrie Wilson, Michelle McCool, & Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Pheonix, Melina, Jillian, Layla, & Victoria
this really turned out to be a good women's match. everybody had a chance to shine and show off their skills. really good match but should have had the elimination stimpulation though. watch for the whoopsy daisy in melina's enterance. 3/5

3. World Tag Team Championship
Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs. Cody Rhodes & Hardcore Holly
cade and murdoch has really evolved into a really good tag team in past years, i would love to see more of their matches. it told a good story and cody rhodes has potential to become a very good superstar if he stays with it. it was a decent match, worth watching. 2.5/5

4. 10 man Survivor series match
triple h, jeff hardy, rey mysterio, & kane vs. umaga, finlay, big daddy v, mr. kennedy, & mvp
this was a great match even though it was 4 on 5 from the beginning due to matts injury on smackdown 2 days earlier, they should have substituted flair in his absence, that would have been a good move. the match was great in itself by letting rey and kane being eliminated first and triple h and hardy battling to be the sole survivors. very great match. 4.5/5

5. Hornswoggle vs. The Great Khali
now these stupid segments shouldn't be on a ppv, especially on one the main 4 ones. khali did gave hornswoggle a vicious slap but it still not help the match rating. finlay comes and saves his little friend, that was the highlight of the match. next time, save it for smackdown. 1/5(just cause finlay came out and saved it)

6. WWE Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton
now the stipulation was hbk could not use sweet chin music and if orton got dqed he would lose the title, stupid rule but it really played out well. if you liked their previous match at cyber sunday, you will really like this match a whole bunch. hbk pulls out all the stops and using moves you rarely see him pull off. hbk uses the mat game to its fullest in this match. hbk pulls out legendary moves in this match including benoit's crossface. this was great match. 5/5

7. World Heavyweight Championship
Hell in the Cell- Batista vs. Undertaker
tremendous match. undertaker really brings out the best in batista. not a lot of weapons used but the one that were used they was really used effectively. they could have used the cell more but still good. other people have spoiled the ending, i personally did not like it, they should have waited until smackdown but i guess they used it to set up the match at wrestlemania. great match to end a great rivalry.i promise you will watch it more than once. 5/5

survivor series is one of the bests in 2007. very worth owning. i highly recommend this ppv.",1205107200,3,3357,4.464926590538336
8258132,4,B000N2HDEQ,I think this years survivor series surpassed last years due to the fact it had two big time main events in randy orton vs michaels and Taker vs Batista HITC Dream match for many. It was good seeing randy orton and shawn have a pure wrestling match and the ending was also very good to me Ecw also had their best ppv by far all the competiors looked good and no one knew who was gonna win good show for the young stars the HITC with taker and batista was also good but the crowd seemed a bit dead maybe because of the awe of it but regardless these two had a battle hard fought it was a little cheap but Im sure this one aint over quite yet all in all this ppv was worth the money and one I will add to the collection now I just cant wait till the rumble -Robert V.,1200355200,,764,3.9038461538461537
8258133,4,B000N2HDEQ,"This year really sucked, PPV speaking for WWE.  Overall, if you want to buy DVDs, you should get, Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, Survivor Series, and Armageddon.

This is Ok, very enterteining, buy I definitely expected more from the WWE Championship, rather than just Blowing the match.

Also, the Hell in the Cell was blown.

Im not going to buy to see the blowouts over and over.",1199750400,,379,4.7846153846153845
