4267837,5,B0046CGING,"After a dramatic debut, the award winning comedy, The Inbetweeners (2008-2010) returns for its second season (Series 2), with six more episodes following the exploits of 17 year old schoolmates, Will (Simon Bird), Simon (Joe Thomas), Jay (James Buckley), and Neil (Blake Harrison).  The humor, which you will probably either love or hate, is even more outrageous, crude, and offensive than before.  Those not familiar with British slang, may miss some of the comic ""nuances"", but the general meaning of most of the humor should be understandable to Americans.  Some spoilers follow, as this review assumes the reader has some familiarity with the program.

Series 2 gets off to a flying start in ""The Field Trip"", as students from Rudge Park Comprehensive school go on an excursion.  Will rents a boat for a romantic date with a girl he has just met, but when the his friends show up early, Will takes them on what becomes a disastrous ride, as Simon falls into the river, and then strips off his clothes.  With the craft dead in the water, Jay signals for help, resulting in the arrival of the authorities.

In ""A Night Out In London"", Simon and the guys head to a fancy club, where Simon hopes to hook up with his unrequited love Carli (Emily Head), and Will with her friend Rachel.  The trip starts out badly, as Neil injures himself on a beer can, then Simon has to trade his sneakers, for a bum's urine soaked shoes, in order to gain entry to the club.  It's all downhill from there, as Neil and Jay are ejected after an incident in the restroom.

Will's misfortunes with women continues, in ""The Duke of Edinburg Awards"", where he becomes interested in an ""older woman"", his former babysitter, who works at a care home for the elderly.  Seeking to impress her, Will volunteers his services and that of his friends, to work at the facility.  Unfortunately for Will, a twisted prank ruins his chance to lose his virginity.

The school year is coming to a close in ""End of Term"".  Most of the students are cramming (revising) for finals, except for Neil, who is playing video games, and Jay, who is a changed man since meeting new girlfriend Chloe.  Things are looking up for Simon, as he and Carli are studying together.  Will is consuming energy drinks in large quantities, as he frantically prepares for the crucial exams.  Unfortunately the drinks affect his digestive system, and he has a most embarrassing accident during the exam, as the term closes on a somber note.

Controversial and offensive, The Inbetweeners isn't for everyone, as the edgy and clever writing, often crosses the line of good taste.  The talented and funny cast, continue to do a convincing job of playing high school students, as the second season sees the guys stretching out a bit more, and getting involved in more outrageous activities.  While it's available, Prime members can view the program for free, and see what all the fuss is about.

This is a Region 2 (PAL) release, so most will need a region-free player to view the discs.  You can often find good deals on The Inbetweeners at Amazon. UK, so you might want to check there.",1371427200,,3120,4.707182320441989
4267838,5,B0046CGING,"A must watch if you've not seen it, the humor is spot on!  Don't think the US version will be worth watching, I expect they'll ruin it like the did with Skins.",1370563200,,159,3.96875
4267839,5,B0046CGING,"Yes, this is the way guys talk. I'm sorry but it's true. It's been years since I heard the word ""clunge"" from my British mates on kibbutz. Just that word brought back so many memories and laughs. Watch every episode and enjoy the word play. It is great.",1369180800,,253,4.291666666666667
4267840,4,B0046CGING,"These four suburban British teens made brilliant cross to the big screen with their movie. It takes everything that worked in the sit com and enriched it to full length. Yes, I did just write that. Watch this and know you Will enjoy",1368576000,,232,4.4186046511627906

8417184,4,B0046CGING,"Hilarious and fun to watch! Alot of raunchy sex humor. Warning though, this series makes jokes about everything, so theres something that will probably offend everyone at some point in the series. Still one of my favorite shows!!",1510012800,,229,5.052631578947368
8417185,5,B0046CGING,Best show ever.,1414108800,,15,4.333333333333333
8417186,5,B0046CGING,"Season 2 of Inbetweeners is a little bit funnier than Season 1.  Season 2 has Simon pining wildly and loudly over his hopeful girlfriend, Carli.

With only six episodes during Season 2, it manages to bring the boys closers together.  Jay's wild stories get only wilder while the desperation to fit in has Will always trying to do something to feel as though he truly belongs.  Neil, always the ""butt"" of father jokes lends a certain innocence to the whole group.",1405209600,,462,4.666666666666667
8417187,5,B0046CGING,I was up all night packing for a trip and finished it in one go.  Totally and completely worth it.,1397433600,,98,3.9
8417188,5,B0046CGING,"Warning: this is not a show for children or anyone with a delicate sensibility! Lots of language and sexual comments. Given that, it's the funniest thing I've seen in a loooong time. The series stars four teenagers at a British public school, who never fail to outrageously screw up every situation presented. For example, one of the characters gets drunk before going over to see a girl he's got a crush on, which causes him to throw up all over her kitchen, and onto her young nephew. One of the four is strangely like a young Eric Idle in voice and appearance, and that only makes it better.

An outrageously funny series!",1391040000,,625,4.580357142857143

8417191,5,B0046CGING,Irreverent but brilliant ...not for the faint hearted and extremely crude but maybe one of the funniest shows ever written!,1384387200,,123,5.2
8417192,5,B0046CGING,Great show...Not for the kids but a good show for a laugh... The characters are great and the movie is good too.. Cant wait for the sequel..,1383091200,,140,4.222222222222222
8417193,3,B0046CGING,The American version is much more funny.  It does make me laugh just not as much as the American version.,1380931200,,105,4.25
