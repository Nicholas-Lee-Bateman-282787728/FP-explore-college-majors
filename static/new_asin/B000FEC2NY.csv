8121425,4,B000FEC2NY,"I really like this and Mr. Withers' other dvd the structure of the human figure or whatever it's called.

While not good at showing you how to DRAW or model anatomy, these dvds are instead just good at making you aware of what the basics of anatomy consists of... anatomy the artist cares about that is, meaning the bones, but not all individual bones like every plate of the skull, or all bones of the wrist. And of course the muscles, but not ALL the muscles, just ones artists care about, and muscle group systems.

This DVD seemed to have most of the information in the Structure dvd, only more quickly reviewed over to get to the motion. Indeed this dvd takes a higher focus at showing you what muscles are involved when people move, and take actions such as running or lifting.
I find these are great dvds when I was new to learning all this stuff, to just plop in, lay back, and watch every day for about a month until it all started to sink in.
I wish this went further in depth, was much longer, and show more actions.

Otherwise this is a good dvd for what it is, getting a good overview of muscles involved with motion, and I could see most artists being happy to have this in their library.  Very good material for review and staying fresh on this stuff, in a pretty good watchable format *though it can make you fall asleep too, not the most exciting presentation*.",1384732800,,1378,4.37109375
8121426,4,B000FEC2NY,"Very well done. I've been hoping for years that someone would work on documenting motion for artists, and this begins to fit the need. It's short, and it could have offered much more, but it is worth the money.",1193443200,8,210,4.410256410256411
8121427,5,B000FEC2NY,This really breaks down human movement in a clear and concise format.  You can really see what the human body does when it's moving...like leaning to one side when carrying a heavy box.  The stop action video really catches everything.  I found it very useful.,1175385600,4,260,4.733333333333333
8121428,5,B000FEC2NY,"All of the videos in this series are excellent in the way the material is presented and  explained. Great  learning  tool. My DVD was skipping and not playing sections I returned it and the company sent me a perfect copy.

I view it once a week and I refer students to look at it during class time. The only aspect I don't like is the fact that you can only see one segment at a time. You cannot view the entire contents with one push of play. The contents can be seen only from the menu.",1162512000,7,488,4.052083333333333
