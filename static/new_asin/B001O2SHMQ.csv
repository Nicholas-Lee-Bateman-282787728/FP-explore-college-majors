8329003,5,B001O2SHMQ,What I loved about this film was how surprising and engaging it was. Surprising in the sense that it never employs melodrama (thank God) but focuses on the reality between two people and how complicated (and  UN-stereotypical) that can be. The leads are simply excellent in this nuanced performance and I loved the ending-NOT where I thought the story was headed and that's always a good thing in my book.,1240185600,2,405,4.785714285714286
8329004,5,B001O2SHMQ,"This film tackles the complexities of the very human individuals involved in a relationship that threatens to destroy one or both of them. Intense performances by the lead actors Gazzaniga and Conlee, a top supporting cast, terrific pacing and sound design all make this story gripping from start to finish. ""How do these people live?"" one character asks, and the film, rather than giving pat or expected answers, makes us probe the layers of the problems to ask more questions, even of ourselves.",1240012800,2,497,5.0
8329005,5,B001O2SHMQ,"I am so glad I got a chance to see So Close. This movie is interestingly structured, with flashbacks triggered by the questionnaire Claire fills out, the movie takes its time with its revelations.  I thought the cast was pitch perfect and the nuanced performances (particularly from Gazzaniga and Conlee) allow the viewer to be drawn in, to understand how this and other similar domestic tragedies can occur incrementally.  I'm telling all my friends to see it!",1237680000,2,461,4.974025974025974
