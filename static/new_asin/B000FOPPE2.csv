2580622,4,B000FOPPE2,"My own children enjoyed the movie, although it is quite different from the book, with the book being much better, as is usually the case.  My class of 5th graders viewed the film as a follow-up to reading the novel in class.  (They too, preferred the book.)  The two titles on one DVD is a good deal.",1208649600,6,300,4.228070175438597
2580633,5,B000FOPPE2,"Used this DVD this summer for 3rd, 4th and 5th graders in a Wednesday night class at church.  I'd show about 20 minutes of it each week, then ask a few questions and let the kids do the talking.  They loved it and were excited to come back to class and find out what would happen next.  We learned many lessons and had fun doing so.",1478217600,,332,4.0

We could have cared less that the package was broken, however when our family tried to watch the movie they were so badly damaged and skipped so much we were unable to watch it.  I have purchased used items before that were always in good condition so I was surprised to find an item that clearly stated good condition to be in such poor condition.
