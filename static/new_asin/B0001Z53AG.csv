8018676,3,B0001Z53AG,"Granted we had already viewed some doccumentaries on Troy prior to viewing this, but it was a little slow and very unengaging.  I purchased the video to show in our Greek Epic unit in High School English, and it really left the kids flat.  Good information, but not the most engaging work out there on this topic.",1205884800,,313,4.473684210526316
8018677,1,B0001Z53AG,"It's amazing how bad this DVD is.  It consistently veers off-topic and stays there for lengthy amounts of time.  There are sections about the city of Bath, England, and information about Roman laxatives, but little about the story of Troy itself.  Towards the beginning, there are series of pictures without any narration, and, in general, the whole thing is a muddle.  It leaves out more than it includes, and never mentions Dido, Virgil, or modern archeological deductions about Hisarlik.  It does tell a lot about the ancient Greeks--including an entire section on the Parthenon--and assumes that Trojans were Greek.",1090627200,10,619,5.212121212121212

8018679,3,B0001Z53AG,"Personally, I find the story of Troy very interesting.  This DVD was very informative, but hard to understand.  The narrator's accent was difficult to tolerate, due to the continual mispronunciations of the characters names.  The documentary also seemed to trail off to other subjects that didn't have anything to do with the story of Troy.  Otherwise, there is about 50 minutes of interesting information, but beware of the frightening clay masks they use when naming each character.",1088985600,7,484,5.246753246753247
8018680,3,B0001Z53AG,"Hector killing Menelaus, Achilles dies inside Troy, Agamemnon killed by Helen, Paris escapes???? Give me a break, they should have name the film ""TROY . . . well, almost"" The 3 stars are for the special effects, it gets one star for the story.",1088553600,12,243,4.545454545454546
8018681,3,B0001Z53AG,"This presentation is a fairly ""out of the box"" history channel style interpretation of the history of Troy, and covers most aspects of the story adequately. I couldn't help thinking that the production of this DVD was rushed in an attempt to cash in on the recent Movie release though, as the production quality has a distinct cheap and hurried feel to it. That having been said, what the program does show is that Troy is a Mythical story: added to and adapted over the centuries and based (albeit loosely) on the epic poem by Homer. Add to this the then various subjective interpretations of that piece of literature over the years, and then re translations by contemporary scholars and you can understand that historical ""accuracy"" is more of a best guess. Those people that are constantly complaining about the recent movie and other dramatic interpretations of this famous story should watch this and remember that fact.
The DVD has little or no extra's but my copy is actually region free coded which was interesting, and certainly adds to the under $10 value. This isn't a great documentary, but it's not bad either and if you can endure the dry voiceover and basement production you will certainly find it's worth owning. Enjoy",1086134400,11,1235,4.830188679245283
8018682,5,B0001Z53AG,"I haven't seen this movie yet, but it sounds really cool. But some of the reviews i hate, like the one with the title ""bad in so many ways"" just because it's wrong about a few things, doesn't make it a bad movie to watch, at least you get inspired about the story, and you want to discover more about it.
Clash of the Titans was a great movie, about how Perseus and Pegasus rescued the beautiful Princess Andromeda, but the story was wrong, because in the real story of Perseus, he uses the shoes of flight when he rescues Andromeda, not Pegasus.
So even if the movie is wrong in some ways, doesn't neccesarly make it horrible. When i first saw this show called Knights of the Zodiac, i became inspired, not in the anime, but in the way how it was based on greek Mythology in a way, if it wasn't for Knights of the Zodiac, i wouln't even knoiw about Perseus and how he rescues Andromeda, or the story of the Trojan Horse. I think this movie sounds like a good way to inspire people to learn more about Greek Mythology.

8018683,1,B0001Z53AG,"This is just a bad DVD. Very little time and money went into it.
The announcer sounds like he has a speach impediment. Some of the
information given is wrong and much of it out of date. They spend
10 minutes or more talking about British poets, that as far as I
can see have nothing to do with Troy. And they show the same images over and over and over (not really good images either).
Avoid this clunker. Google Troy if you are interested in history.",1084752000,5,451,4.195402298850575
8018684,4,B0001Z53AG,"I thought this documentary was very informative and interesting, telling more about the story, myth, and characters involved in the story of Troy.  It talks about Greek gods and mythology, and how the legend of Troy stems from Homer's story; the music was nice, sometimes dramatic, sometimes soothing.  I like the voiceover: he sounded like ""lifestyles of the rich & famous""!
There were these clay masks interspersed to, I guess, define the characters, and I couldn't help but chuckle a bit.  The shots of buildings and architecture, nature and drawings, etc. were very nice: I especially like seeing maps of where Troy was thought to be, etc.  I found this DVD to be a good resource to find out more about the real history and story of Troy, in preparation for the film with Brad Pitt!
Definately recommended if you are interested in the history of Troy, or if you ever watch the History or Discovery Channel!",1083628800,7,910,4.777070063694268
