5612522,5,B00BEZDHUK,"I have always been a big fan of George Carlin and with this twin-pack of his last two HBO specials, you get him at his most acerbic.  I say this with all good intentions because if you look back on Mr. Carlin's early work, you will notice something that some comics never do; they change with the times and they age well when they do.  This DVD 2 pack is a fitting, and at times, prophetic salute to a man who kept me laughing for at least 30 years. Rest in Peace, Mr. Carlin.  We will not forget you.",1401926400,5,501,4.040404040404041

5612533,5,B00BEZDHUK,"One of the funniest comedians of our time. George pulls no punches and tells it exactly like it is in America, all the while injecting his unique style of humor into the truths he reminds us of. I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing back in 2008. He was the voice of ""the people"" and will be missed. R.I.P. George.",1461110400,,321,4.193548387096774

5612536,5,B00BEZDHUK,"It's George Carlin. What else is there to say? He's as good as it gets, and we lost him too soon. The things he was railing against remain weirdly current today, which goes to show that much of the B.S. in life never changes, so all you can do is laugh at it.",1456790400,,259,3.9056603773584904
