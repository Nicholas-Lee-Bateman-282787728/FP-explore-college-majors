7005034,5,B00TEC7IEG,"I gotta say ""Looking"" was one of my favorite shows from last season, because it's so real, so raw, and so relatable, and you forget it was a ""gay show"", so I was really excited for season 2.
Season 2 of Looking gives us just more of what made this show amazing during its first season with some nice additions, from new characters, new entertaining plots that kept me excited for the next episode during the 10 weeks this season aired. It has drama, funny bits, love, and all the characters truly get more development during this season; the show is the perfect definition of a guilty pleasure. The cast is so talented, although there wasn't enough Richie I'm not complaining. The whole cast is awesome.
I'm just really hoping it gets renewed! Come on HBO! Looking is an amazing TV series that needs to air for many more seasons, I'll be crushed if they cancel it because it's one of the best shows of the season. SEASON 3 IS NECESSARY.
If you haven't seen the show, buy the season 1 DVD and pre-order the season 2 DVD already! It's worth the pre-order.",1427068800,39,1053,4.461139896373057
7005045,5,B00TEC7IEG,"This film, no matter its imperfections, gives the audience a small glimpse or window into the lives a group of gays in San Francisco CA!  It is so true to life at times, as to really hit home!  NJMJr!!
P S Sorry but have to put this observation in here!  The characters that Jonathan Groff and Frankie J. Alvarez gave this film-series an identification all of its own!  The chemistry between these two actors in their emotional close proximity, literally set off a very hot electrical storm of gigantic proportions.  These scenes are hard to forget.  The ending where Alvarez lays his head on Groff's shoulder while seated in that diner, was the ultimate romantic ending for a very grand series!!  NJMJr!!",1504310400,,705,4.729508196721311

7005047,5,B00TEC7IEG,One of the best shows!,1502928000,,22,3.6
7005048,5,B00TEC7IEG,"I have rated it 5 stars for the fact this is an adult gay drama which is missing in 2017 on TV. I've been waiting since Queer as Folk for another show that appeals to me as a drama with gay themes. This one comes close, but I felt the main character Patrick is somewhat unsympathetic so for that I would only rate it 4 stars.

But since most folks look at the star rating I am giving it 5 because at least this was a good try at a series even though it was cut short. I would have hoped by season 3 or 4 the charters would have been more rounded and fleshed out more to reflect what I personally see an an adult in the LGBTQ+ community. Unfortunately I never got to see that happen as this series was cancelled after only 2 seasons.

Otherwise this was a series that at least provided me entertainment value in the genre I feel is totally lacking these days. Even if I didn't feel Patrick was the best possible character, I applaud the series for being made and for HBO to at least allow 2 seasons and a follow-up movie.",1501718400,,1020,4.095

7005067,4,B00TEC7IEG,"Despite my doubts, it did hook me up to a certain point. By the 3rd episode you are living with these guys and want to know, what's next.
The show is truthful, catchy and can relate to the real life we all are facing. All 18 episodes of the first 2 seasons took my 2 evenings completely (and some of the nights too). Thumbs up!
Looks like the usual SF gay crowd - cruel, judging, hungry for perfect relationships, obsessed with physical attractiveness and always in the clouds.
PS. Some dialogues with the discussions about the certain male physical details can be found disgusting for the non-American viewers.

And, then there's the movie. Which is made as a logical 3rd season and the end of the show. Here is everything different.
It feels like a Hallmark postcard - you understand, that there's the meaning and THE message, but you see nothing new and/or memorable. The idea of the necessary ""happy end"" killed a lot of American movies and TV series and it certainly did kill the ending of ""Looking"". Like American version of ""Queer as Folk"", the story becomes so preachy and predictable, that you can guess the ending after first 15 minutes. But I guess most of the viewers still need the sugar-overdosed fairytales... Or not?

Resume:
4 stars for the first 2 seasons.
2 stars for the movie.
Overall - 4 stars. Because - they made me watch it to the end somehow.",1498694400,,1368,4.579591836734694

This show is really a back and forth with Patrick deciding between Kevin and Richie, but the whole time I felt that Kevin and Richie were the real catches. Nothing about the main character Patrick appealed to me and I certainly don't know what Kevin or Richie saw in him, but it was a good show nonetheless. Recommended",1485993600,2,456,4.376470588235295

I was not a fan of Augustine and did not really believe he would have been friends with Dom and Patrick as the show progressed.  While I acknowledge there were a few bumps in season two, I felt the show had promise and would have liked to see it continue for at least another season or two.  The wrap up movie was a nice gift to fans, even though I did not believe for a minute that Ritchie and the new BF would be friends with Patrick's core group of friends.",1483401600,6,617,4.074380165289257

7005139,5,B00TEC7IEG,"First I'll review the show itself, then the Blu-ray package.  It took me a couple of episodes to warm up to the show, but by the 5th episode of the first season I was hooked.  Patrick, Agustin and Dom are three gay friends living in San Francisco and the show is about them looking for love, fulfillment at work and with their families.  It's an ensemble show, but Patrick is definitely the lead. He's sweet, but prone to saying or doing dumb things and he really does grow up a lot in the 2 seasons and the movie. Agustin received a lot of criticism in the first season, as he did dick-ish things, but he could be sweet at times and even though he blew up his relationship, his friends always had his back.  Dom is the oldest (he turns 40 in season 1), and is facing middle age without a real career or boyfriend, but he also has strong support from his roommate Doris.

The show was cancelled after 2 seasons, but HBO gave us a movie to wrap things up--which it did.  With only an hour and half, and wanting to be a movie, not just a couple of episodes strung together, the producers wisely focused almost exclusively on Patrick (I don't think there's a scene he's not in).  The movie works on its own, but has amazing callbacks to prior episodes and does wrap things up nicely.

The acting is nearly always great, standouts are Jonathan Groff, Raul Castillo, Murray Bartlett and Lauren Weedman,  There's also a lot of nice things to look at--both in the handsome guys and in the great background shots of San Francisco.

As for the Blu-ray set, nearly every episode has a commentary track, which are always fun and informative.  I wish there had been a commentary for the movie and maybe  some deleted scenes and/or blooper reel...that's the only negative thing I have to say about the set.

A code for a digital download--ultraviolet or iTunes--is included.

The show may not be everyone's thing, but I loved it and highly recommend it.",1481932800,24,1940,4.49002849002849
7005140,5,B00TEC7IEG,I love the series and hated to see it cancelled. I think the characters are very real and down to earth. I think some wanted a more spicy type of series which this is not.

7005144,5,B00TEC7IEG,"Very sad for Kevin, but very happy for Richie.  The movie ends with the promise of a sequel happening in the future (I hope).  The ending of the relationship between Kevin and Patrick shows us how badly we can hurt others by not communicating effectively, not listening to he words of others and by being selfish, and thoughtless.

7005158,5,B00TEC7IEG,"I binge watched seasons 1 and 2 of Looking in just a week; I was completely hooked. The characters and storyline draw you in such a way that you feel as though you really know those people; in a way, you might just: it's all very relatable, very contemporary. It's a story for our times. And it's like popcorn - once you start, you just can't have one, you've gotta have them all. That was just before the announcement that there wouldn't be a season 3. It was a hard blow.

With so much on TV that is far less inferior in content and much less meaningful, to see a show like this go is just a shame! But it was nice to see the respect HBO showed the series and its fans by having a movie as a closure; the movie is like a mini-season in itself, really. It could easily be 4 or 5 episodes. And for once, the movie is everything I hoped it could be - as a fan, it's hard to have your expectations realized onscreen, but the movie did that. It's sad, bittersweet, but there's a lot of hope for the future in it. It makes you want to go out and be with the people you love. What can be better than that?

And speaking of hope--- I hope this isn't the last we've seen of these people. Maybe in 10 years or so, it would be lovely to see where they are in their lives-- Gilmore Girls style. Are you listening, Netflix?! ;)",1480118400,,1316,4.038314176245211

Not all shows have great ratings at first, they need time to develop a following, and this show had a huge following. It always amazed me how many straight people (mostly women who loved the guys) loved this show. ""Queer As Folk"" went for several seasons, and the world is more accepting today than when that was on Showtime, so HBO's decision is sad. I loved Patrick the most, you couldn't help but love him, even as you cringed at some of the bad decisions he made. Doris was such a trip, I loved her humor. This show brought back so many memories of living in San Francisco for me, I live in Santa Barbara now, but I go visit every chance I get.

7005170,5,B00TEC7IEG,I enjoyed watching Season 2 on HBO  it was a lot better this season.  It Would be great if they did a movie of this that Would be so cool to watch .,1428364800,,148,3.4545454545454546
7005171,5,B00TEC7IEG,"HBO needs to renew for season 3. Things were left up in the air but they came full circle for Patrick and Richie. Season one ended with Richie saying ""I'm this close to falling in love with but I'm not gonna let that happen to me because I don't think you're ready."" He waits a few seconds while Patrick remains silent and tears run down his cheek. Then Richie tenderly kisses Patrick on the cheek while Patrick touches Richie's hair and neck. Season two ends with Richie touching Patrick hair and asking him ""are you ready.""  He waits a few seconds and Patrick looks up at him , smiles and says ""I'm ready.""  I'm ready too!  There are so many places to go. Patrick's mom is going through life changes and I can see her opening up to Richie and saying ""At last I get to meet Richie."" I also see her (Julia Duffy) recognizing Richie's goodness and admonishing Patrick playfully with a ""well dear don't screw it up again this time."" Frank needs to come back to bring some drama into Agustin and Eddie's relationship. Dom needs to succeed and Doris needs to come back somehow. Possibly after a silly spat with Malik. I hate her being ordinary, although I think Malik is a good guy. What she had with Dom was unique. Kevin will probably not give up and it could get awkward. But he won't be alone long with his accent and looks. After all, he was the hit of the Christmas party in his new penthouse. Though I like Russell Tovey as an actor, I never trusted Kevin's motives. If he would cheat on Jon with Patrick (after less than 2 years) then he could do the same on Patrick. I think he moved from Seattle to get away from Jon and Patrick was a handy excuse. And, Patrick threw himself at him from their first meeting. Kevin was cautious about their relationship, reluctant to tell the office or the real estate saleswomen. Patrick's forced him to ask him to move in (mattress selection scene). Bring back Ceci and more on Richie's family. Especially his relationship with his father. There's so much more to these stories. Don't leave us hanging!",1428278400,17,2043,4.457219251336898
7005172,5,B00TEC7IEG,"I was so excited watching the first season of HBO's Looking, that I couldn't wait for a second. And it has not disappointed in the least. What was, I feel, a real and accurate portrait of modern gay men has only become more honest and more real. These are issues and problems that speak to us not only if we're gay, but if we're human. One of the more compelling plot line's concerns Patrick's romance with his boss who is already involved in one. It's the flip side of all these modern, open relationships, what happens when actual feelings come into play?  I can't say it enough, it's affirming to see yourself and your community reflected back at you in a quality project. Realities such as top vs. bottom, aging gracefully in a youth obsessed culture, and even the use of recreational drugs are dealt with realistically and honestly. I hope we can continue to see this group of diverse friends grow and change. And that diversity is also refreshing, these characters aren't clones or parodies they are unique individuals that each have a different viewpoint on modern gay life. I recently turned an online friend in a middle eastern country onto this show. Surprisingly to me, he had access to it online and was quite simply blown away, and as I always am, thoroughly entertained!",1427673600,7,1284,4.68141592920354
7005173,5,B00TEC7IEG,This is a great show that is helping the general public move towards acceptance. The show has a great diverse group of characters that are lovable. I just can't get enough of this show along with everyone else. It's the most talked about gay show on TV. It's a must have and HBO needs to bring this back for another season. #HBOnotcancelLooking ... Or Netflix should pick it up if HBO won't.,1427328000,27,391,4.444444444444445
7005174,5,B00TEC7IEG,"Looking on HBO is one of my favorite television shows the last two seasons. The writing, cast, directing and style are top notch. Looking may not be everyone's cup of tea. It may have also let some viewers down by not living up to the stereotypical gay soap hyper-life depicted in other programs like Queer as Folk. Looking is very different. The story is best described as a slow burn and is super quiet at times. The story lines and character arcs have been true to life and seem so real. This group of friends are not all super likeable all the time. I've often been angry at the way they've treated each other and at the same time marveled at the love they share. It's the love them, hate them, love them relationship that keeps me coming back. Watching the outstanding cast bring these imperfect people to life and have me cheering for them to get their acts together is quite an accomplishment. The season 2 finale was simply some of the best writing, acting and directing of 2015.",1427328000,19,987,4.488888888888889
