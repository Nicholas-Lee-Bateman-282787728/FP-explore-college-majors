3000023,1,B000XA5JZS,"I absolutely loved this series. It was so well done, and I was very sad when it was cancelled at the end of season two. :(

Now, the WB seems bound and determined to continue to release four episodes per disc of this series, and I am afraid that the low sales are going to keep them from releasing the season sets anytime soon.

Newsflash! The low sales on these limited episode sets are because everyone is waiting for you to release the season sets!!!!!!!! C'mon, WB! Release the season sets of Legion of Superheroes....please.",1214352000,7,529,4.557894736842106
3000024,3,B000XA5JZS,"One thousand years from now, the Legion of Superheroes, a group of extraordinary teens, decides to travel back in time to recruit the greatest superhero into its ranks. But they overshoot and go back a bit too far in time. What they end up with isn't Superman in his prime, but, rather, a raw, untested teenager named Clark Kent who's about to embark for Metropolis. This animated series, then, follows Clark Kent's adventures in the far flung 31th Century as he helps the Legion do battle against a host of intergalactic menaces.

LEGION OF SUPERHEROES Vol. 2 stingily doles out four more episodes from this series' pretty good 13-episode inaugural season, as Warner Brothers again do us the dirty by releasing a season, bits at a time. Personally, I recommend that you wait for the complete season release before dropping your dollars. But it all depends on your waiting stamina. I'm not sure if the series's cancellation (sadly, after a mere two seasons!) will have any bearing on the promptness of its dvd releases.

As far as the four episodes included here, all in all, they're decent enough, for all that they aren't my favorites of the first season. As usual, a young Superman serves as the centerpiece. Two episodes focus muchly on Lightning Lad, not one of my preferred Legionnaires. Family dynamics surface as Phantom Girl is embarassed by her mom, who happens to be the President of the United Planets, and Garth Ranzz renews his sibling rivalry with his older brother Mekt. And if you thought Garth was cocky, wait 'til you get a load of Mekt. I like Bouncing Boy a lot, so ""Fear Factory"" was a treat for me as Bouncing Boy's fascination with horror films plays a hilarious and key role in the plot. With sensibilities catered to the younger bunch, LEGION OF SUPERHEROES consistently lacks that dark maturity and tortured complexity displayed by the various animated shows in the DC Animated Universe, a universe, by the way, with which this show shares no continuity. LEGION OF SUPERHEROES goes down light like a midday snack, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Despite its lack of impactful adult-oriented themes, it's solidly entertaining and action-packed and injected with frequent doses of humor.

On the segue tip, I believe that the best episodes of Season 1 happen to be the introductory ""Man of Tomorrow"" (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legion-of-Super-Heroes-Volume-1/dp/B000Q7ZLU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legion of Super Heroes Volume 1</a>), the laugh-out-loud funny ""The Substitutes"", ""Chain of Command"" and the two-part ""Sundown"" (these last four should be in the future Volume 3 release). Here's a breakdown of Volume 2's four episodes:

(Some mild SPOILERS now.)

- ""Champions"" - The 343rd Intergalactic Games pits Lightning Lad against his brother Mekt, even as the Fatal Five targets Phantom Girl's mother for assassination. By the way, the announcers of the Games are a hoot (""We've got a supervillain brawl brewin' here, folks, and it looks like it's gonna be a doozy. Uh, we'll be right back after a word from our sponsor."").

- ""Fear Factory"" - Their spacecraft buffeted about by a cosmic storm, the Legionnaires take refuge in an ancient, creepy space station and, one by one, find themselves succumbing to their inner fears.

- ""Brain Drain"" - When Brainy falls prey to an uploading glitch, Timberwolf and Superman must brave the most inhospitable planet in the galaxy for his cure.

- ""Lightning Storm"" - Lightning Lad resigns from the Legion to join a much hipper mercenary group, the Light Speed Vanguard. But then he's stunned to learn that his brother, Mekt, is already a member of the LSV. Meanwhile, Bouncing Boy holds auditions for new team memberships (aspiring members include the uninspiring Breath Boy, who can hold his breath really long).

Let's say, one star for the meager number of episodes on this dvd. And three, maybe three and a half, stars for the episodes themselves. So, rounded out, call it 2 and a half stars. And, because Warner Brothers haven't finished slapping their target audience around, no bonus features are provided; sorry, promos for other animated shows don't count. I think I'm about to have my mad on again.",1209859200,6,4238,5.095100864553314
3000025,5,B000XA5JZS,"When I heard both Teen Titans and Justice League Unlimited were coming to and end, I was filled with sadness.  It would be the first time since 1992 that there hadn't been a Paul Dini-produced DC Comics animated series on TV.  I had followed every single series, from Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, Batman Beyond, and Justice League to Teen Titans, and no matter what approach the animators took, the stories were always top-notch.  So when Justice League did an episode in the final season sending Super Girl into the future, the set-up was perfect for a Legion series.  However, Warner changed their minds and basically redid the episode as the pilot featuring a teenage Superman (they couldn't get the rights to the name Superboy) joining the Legion.  The first season was well-done, in the manner of Teen Titans, a quasi-anime comic take on the books.  Now, in the second season, they have moved farther into the future, and adopted a more serious tone ala Justice League, featuring a young adult Superman, as well as a new character, the cloned Superman-X.  There is also a defining story arc to the season, with the Legion facing a new uber villain.  If you are a fan of DC comics, this is perfect for kids.",1199923200,6,1221,4.726415094339623

3000047,3,B000XA5JZS,"This DVD continues the adventures of Superboy with the 31st Century's Legion of Super-Heroes.  They go to a futuristic Olympics, get stranded in a spooky space station, save a member from a literal breakdown and meet their rivals the Light Speed Vanguard.

With this volume the series kind of plateaus becoming a threat of the week sort of show.  There's still some nice Easter eggs and cute moments, but a lot of repetitiveness too.  One high point for me was a classic bit from the comics, Legion try outs!  A lot of minor Legion characters are scattered in there.

It's a shame this series never got a proper release (and season 2 is still MIA).  I'd recommend getting the set of volumes 1-3 over individual episodes.

In my opinion, ""Fear Factory"" was probably the weakest program on the disc with its odd, ""Haunted House in Space"" idea which had some issues particularly with Bouncing Boy reduced to typical cowardly fat guy. It was a bit much.

The other three episodes are far more enjoyable. The relationship between Lightning Lad and his brother featured two episodes is pretty intriguing. Also, ""Fear Factory"" and ""Brain Drain"" are solid looks at Brainiac 5. In the end, this is a likable group of heroes with great fun for kids and kids at heart.",1405555200,,759,4.6992481203007515

It's complete awesomeness, and I really wish that they had at least continued into a third season, maybe direct to video or something, but I think they shouldn't have left at such a frustrating cliffhanger in season 2. It's a really great show though, the animation is smooth, the humor is fresh and ACTUALLY FUNNY(like in Brain Drain), the themes in the show are obvious but they don't punch you in the face, and...it gets kind of addicting, actually.",1242604800,2,641,4.487179487179487
