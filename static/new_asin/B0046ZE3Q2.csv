8417523,2,B0046ZE3Q2,"I like this workout and the Rania workout series but I felt deceived in this purchase. I thought it was something new but it is the same thing as as another workout in her series called ""Hipper than Hip""",1352851200,,203,4.230769230769231
8417524,1,B0046ZE3Q2,This is Rania's Hipper Than Hip DVD with a new name there is not one iota of new material down to the 2 performances at the end.  I have other DVD's of Rania's this is now the second time I have been disappointed.  It should have been stated this is the same DVD with a new name.  I have the Hipper Than Hip DVD and did not need another copy.,1303171200,6,342,3.857142857142857
8417525,5,B0046ZE3Q2,"I own Rania's ""Discover Bellydance"" series & her other ""too hip"" DVD.  I didn't get ""hipper than hip"" because all of the bad reviews.  I like working out to all of these!  The ""too hip"" & ""Fit To Be Hip"" are similar to each other with the same dancers, repeating of the routines, faster paced & the background but with different moves involved--I still like them both:-) To me, they are fun & make me feel good about myself & sexy.  I love the music & the girl's outfits. Rania has made me love bellydance even more......these videos get me exited in the morning to want to exercise!",1294963200,,583,4.37037037037037
8417526,1,B0046ZE3Q2,"I was so excited about this dvd when I first saw it. I thought it was a new dvd and hopefully better then Hipper than hip, it was a just a bit messy but still a good workout. Well it was worse, it was the same excat dvd except repackaged. Do not buy if you have already had hipper than hip or currently have it!",1294444800,10,311,3.8
8417527,2,B0046ZE3Q2,"Let me be the first to warn you all, this is Hipper than Hip in new packaging!  To add insult to injury, the original Hipper than Hip is cheaper.  I do not dislike Rania, and do have many of her dvd's.  However I did not have Hipper than Hip because I never ordered it based on bad reviews.  The other reviews are accurate, it may be a faster paced cardio workout than her other dvd's but does not flow well at all.  I'm very dissapointed and may actually return the video.",1294358400,8,473,4.153846153846154
