225814,5,6300184250,"A film of the 1960s, in its picture of a society in dislocation, finding refuge in the superficialities of manipulable communications media, and starring Julie Christie, a great ikon of that decade.  The film is  convincing in its picture of literature as the final carrier of  civilization, as the enduring medium of human expression, of the values of  liberal society, and the object of total human commitment.  The living  books, the passing on of Weir of Hermiston from grandfather to grandson,  are amongst the most moving scenes in cinema.",917395200,5,545,5.056179775280899

225876,4,6300184250,"Less of a review and more of a question to anyone buying this in 2018. My copy was very clearly marked both on the jacket and the disc itself as being wide screen, but it is not. I looked in vain for somewhere in the menu to select widescreen in case it was in multiple formats. The funny thing is that the  short ""the making of..."" showed all widescreen clips from the movie and the original intro clip is also in widescreen, but the feature is not. Very weird. Considering just how hard it seems to be for this mistake to have happened I don't know if it would do any good to return it and get another one.
It's a terrific  movie and I just love Julie Christie in both parts. I wanted to see it before the HBO remake comes out shortly. Good luck.",1519776000,,748,4.116438356164384

225878,5,6300184250,"I first saw this film at the State Theater in Kalamazoo, MI, in 1966 when I was a sophomore at Western Michigan University. It chilled me to the bone then, and it has the same effect as I view this great digitized edition. It's not a perfect film (I haven't found one yet), but an extraordinarily fine one.  It remains my favorite film of all time.

The story seems even more relevant now as television and the Internet begin to push print media into the background and as nearly all of the media that most of us see every day are owned and controlled by a corporate oligarchy with a pro-capitalist bias.

Julie Christie is great playing both of the female leads, and I find Oscar Werner and Cyril Cusack convincing as the intellectually curious fireman and his cynical chief. The settings are well-chosen, the cinematography is superb, and the music supports the drama beautifully. It's a great adaptation/interpretation of Ray Bradbury's classic dystopian novel. Highly recommended.

I saw many great films in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and this one still stands among the best of them.",1518998400,3,1093,4.767195767195767
225879,4,6300184250,"I apologize.  I made a gross error in my prior review. I moved up my rating to a high.  I could not locate closed captioning for my hard of hearing  boyfriend so I originally gave this DVD a low rating.  However, I put the disc back on my machine and scrolled down to a language setting and sure enough,  the display had a selection for the hearing impaired.  The captions were EXCELLENT!! The lettering was clear and large. It was better than most closed captioning found on other  DVD's because the wording appeared below each actor so my boyfriend could tell which actor was saying a specific line and when. He was totally thrilled so therefore I'm elevating my rating to 4 stars.  I did not give it 5 stars because for me, the volume was turned up all the way and it did not play very loud.

226003,5,6300184250,"I watched this film because I love the Ray Bradbury book, plus I'm a huge fan of Bernard Herrmann's music. I gave it my usual two views, and came away greatly enchanted by the end scene (again, mostly for the music), and completely turned off (at times furious) about the rest of it. The bizarre, antiseptic feel to it, Julie Christie's hardly acceptable acting, the (imo) negative departures from the book...

then I watched it a third time. And a fourth. And now I have to hold back from giving it five stars.

This is one of those movies that unfolds its value upon repeated viewings. Upon my aforementioned fourth viewing, the whole plot device involving the public-sanctioned medications really hit home for me, today it almost seems prophetic. This day and age brings with it the era of seemingly any sort of admitted feelings of (perfectly natural and essential) angst being labelled as ""clinical depression"".

The sterile, hospital cleanliness of the film also started to make sense the more I watched. In a world that does all it can to exclude internal experience (vociferously campaigning to erase ""unhappy"", i.e. individual thought), the setting would ultimately end up being about as spotlessly clean and neat as certain areas of the world today (which I won't point out specifically due to political reasons that might colour this review negatively).

The masses are encouraged to watch television. A lot. And what's on tv is a lot of condescending talk that comes across as intentional dumbing down...and if you don't like it, there's something wrong with you. At one point Christie's character (the protagonist Montag's wife) engages in what appears to be a sort of pseudo-interactive tv show. The show's prefabbed seams showing obviously, even to a pre-reading Montag. When Montag mentions this, Christie calls him mean for mentioning it...and turns to the tv once again.

Savoring something is discouraged....Montag's wife can't even remember how they met (providing one of the most revealing scenes in the movie). Her cluelessness (and, judging by her actions it is an at least somewhat desired cluelessness). That last is just one of the things that starts to bother Montag, once he's started reading.

That government wished to have children as its subjects, and through the use of media and drugs and long work hours they achieved it. Books (inward reflection) ruin that.

Even Bradbury loved it (and agreed with my own, oblivious judgement that Christie was the most glaring weak point).

The people at the end, repeating the books they love over and over, holding fast to that, at any cost...to self expression, seen through the eyes of  another. Sartre (whom is mentioned specifically in the film) would have had a field day with this movie. And so will you.

If you just let yourself THINK about it.",1503964800,,2825,4.978768577494692
226024,1,6300184250,"There are those who really love this movie, and I cannot understand why.  I show just clips of it to my students to help them appreciate how far we have come with movies and to reveal how much better the book is than this waste of plastic.  The same actress plays Clarisse and Mildred, which I have heard some claim was done for artistic reasons and to reveal how the characters are true foils; however, my theory is that they were just to cheap to hire two different actresses.  The movie is putrid; they don't even attempt to include the mechanical hound, which actually might be a blessing in disguise, because based on the special effects present, they probably would have wrapped a golden retriever in tin foil.",1502496000,,716,4.578125
226025,5,6300184250,"for me,  the thrill of watching Fahrenheit 451 never cools. It is a social warning set in a futuristic Europe where reading is simply forbidden, books are a crime,  firemen tear through the streets looking for books to burn.  I love the use of what was then futuristic ideas,  interactive tv,  or the monorail out in a rural setting,  I remember when boys were kicked out of school,  or held down and shaved  if they had long hair.  this film reminds us of the abuse of peoples individuality.
 the look of the film is fabulous,  so perfectly stylized out of the orange and green couture designs from 1966-72.  I love the art direction.  there are Giant tv's,  which at the time seemed ludicrous and which,  today, of course, have come and gone,  the companions of the society,  bent on keeping meloncoly emotions like sorrow, lonliness, remorse, anywhere but in here. The French do celebrate these low tides of the human experience,  and the lovely director, Francious Truffaut,  is able to make the point well.  using  a very suppressed and angry Oskar Werner as the vessel of fury for the loss of humanity,  we are reminded how every persons journey effects every other person he comes in contact with. Werner's German accent makes the whole film that much more...odd.  misplaced.  as if something is here that does not belong.
  The fire truck and the music in the opening scene are fabulous.  From the very beginning credits, we know Truffaut is giving you his all.  the credits are spoken!  Because,  hey,  no one here can read and anyway reading is against the law.  watching the antennae and tuning into the incredible score,  xylophones, and strings with my hi def wi fi.. I am already futurized.
  The view of the filmmakers seems to be that literature is the only true pastime for the intelligentsia. the communist  USSR society seems to be a backdrop for this future, where all is take care of and no one desires much,  and you are in big trouble is you misbehave.  America also has her say,  with too much time on their hands and nothing to do,  pills are everywhere.  ODing is just a fact of everyday life.  the social austerity of the USSR  meets the social obesity of the USA,  and so it is only natural that people ...  .. people find a way out by becoming a piece of fiction.  they
become a book.
  It is still one of if not my favorite ending of any movie.  The besotted antihero finds his way out of the city and follows the tracks to the place where people are living off the land,  together,  reciting the books they love until they know them by heart.  Each introduces himself by the title of a book.
And as the walk through the snow together reciting themselves,  I have this feeling of home,  purpose,  simplicity.  I long to be there,  and I especially long to be there in Julie Christy's gorgeous suede coat.  It was the height of cool fashion,  and I still get an old feeling of my whole life being before me every time I see her in her coat,  in a world of her own,  saving herself,  and sacrificing herself,  for a larger meaning as well.

also that scene where he hides in the boat and the policemen are coming in the air in those rockets,  that used to scare the crap out of me.",1502409600,2,3209,4.450606585788561

226027,5,6300184250,"Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) is an ideal fireman. He knows his job is to burn books. He does this well until one day he runs across an old woman who decides books are important enough for her to burn with them. Now he is intrigued as to what hold books had on her and decides to take a peak. So he pilfers a few books. Even his boss (Cryil Cusack) knows that it is irresistible to want to peak at the forbidden as long as you do not get carried away. Montag gets carried away. He even forces his wife, Linda Montag (Julie Christie) and her friends to listen to him reading out loud. It looks like time for someone to turn him in. mean time Montage strikes up a friendship with an outcast school teacher. The whole reason for burning books was to clamp down on people like her that bring up subjects that make people sad.

What will become of these misfits?
Will society collapse? Or is this our future?

Yes, the book is more intricate; however, the movie captures the essence of the story. One major deviation from the book that some people miss in the reading is that the society was not against books and reading, they had technical manuals; they were against literature and unauthorized reading material. The more trivial differences are the changing of his wife's name from Margaret to Linda, and the absence of the mechanical dog; the dog important to the book plot is not necessary in the movie.

You will immediately notice that the movie credits are presented verbally. This was a well-put together movie and stands on its own with any other of this genre. Another interesting touch is having Julie Christie play both the wife with long hair and the school teacher with short hair so you get a contrast on personalities. In the book it was a teenage neighbor.

I still watch this movie periodically to see what I misses while anticipating the next seen. Watching the nightly news today with everyone warning us of criminals on the loose, I get visions of Montag being tracked down on camera. I expect the TV announcer to tell me to go to the front door and look for the perpetrator.

Try watching the movie first then read the book by the same name.

226087,4,6300184250,"This is an odd film, made all the more fascinating after viewing the ""making of"" content on the Blu-Ray. Director Truffaut was a French auteur out of his element in an English production. Nicholas Roeg's amazing cinematography showed he was at the top of his game. And, Bernard Herrmann's post-Hitchcock soundtrack will knock your socks off. But filming was rife with problems, and star Oskar Werner's conflict with Truffaut was definitely a challenge.

Much has been written about this film's Blu-ray transfer on Amazon's own blu-rayDOTcom website (hit your fave search engine) if you want the details. The HD transfer is by no means perfect, but it is good, clean, and with the expected high resolution of a film made in the 1960s. It's good enough for most of us, and certainly the best available. Most of the extras were taken from an older US DVD release, and are ""boxed"" on all sides with little restoration. However, the included alternative opening is perfect, and makes you wonder why they changed it for release. A good photo gallery is included, with behind the scenes and production photos, and movie posters from around the world.

If you are a fan of the novel or 1960s sci-fi, this is a must have for its low price (less than $9.99). I personally enjoy the film, but when compared to hard sci-fi of the late 60s like 2001, Planet of the Apes, The Prisoner, and Star Trek, this film feels like a missed opportunity.",1497916800,,1429,4.734939759036145

226135,3,6300184250,"Although not Truffaunt's most accomplished work (he spoke only French so the translated screenplay dialog sounds a bit awkward and clunky at times), ""Fahrenheit 451"" was a noble and often inspired film versin of Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel.

In the future firemen burn books rather than put out fires. One of these firemen Montag (Osker Werner) meets a school teacher neighbor named  Clarisse (Julie Christie in a dual role) who sparks his interest in the things he destroys. His wife (also played by Christie in a fascinating bit of casting that adds to the subtext of the film) seems oblivious to Montag's changes wrapped up in reality TV shows and obsessed with rearranging the furniture in the house. Montag takes a book one day from a house where the firemen are called to destroy a collection of an older woman who decides to die with her books. Montage hides the book as he gets drawn further and further into an alien world of reading and ideas where he feels like he belongs.

Dogged by problems between director and lead actor Werner (Werner, who had worked with and enjoyed working with Truffaut hated him during production fighting Truffaut throughout production. Perhaps Werner's alcoholism had something to do with the difficulty) and the challenge of shooting a film in another language he didn't understand, ""Fahrenheit 451"" holds up remarkably well in spite of the difficulty between actor-director and the language barrier. In many respects, the film seems even more relevant now particularly after the latest (2016) election where the essence of truth is compromised by the Internet and tweeting. Certainly the rise of reality shows  mass media and its impact on reading (which inspired Bradburyt to write the novel along with the book burnings during the era of Nazi Germany) makes it even more relevant today.

While Truaffaut's film isn't perfect, it certainly has some inspired moments in spite of its flaws and Christie gives a strong performance as Claire. It's a pity that Terence Stamp dropped out of the production (he was afraid of being overshadowed by Christie's dual performance) as he could have brought more power to the central performance but what we do have still works quite well.

This is a Walmart exclusive until June but it will receive a widespread release after that. The elements used for the transfer are clearly older and there's too much digital noise reduction applied wiping out quite a bit of grain and detail. Depth is problematic because of the digital filtering used for the image. This is still an improvement over the DVD but could have been much better looking. As it is, this is an under whelming Blu-Ray.

Thr audio sounds fine (English and Japanese oddly enough but no French) and we get optional subtitles in English, Swedish, Finnish and Japanese. It's a pity that we don't get the dubbed French version as Truffaut preferred this version to the English.

The special features for the DVD have been imported over by Universal which is a nice touch. We get Julie Christie's commentary track, a making of documentary that lasts about 45 minutes. Author Bradbury discusses writing the novel in a featurette. There's also a fine featurette on the music (composed by Bernard Herrmann and an influence on the score for, of all things, The Beatles' ""Elenanor Rigby"" score by George Martin) . The original theatrical trailer and photo & poster gallery round out special features.

While it's nice to have this classic (if flawed film) available on Blu-Ray I really wish that Universal  had struck up a new transfer for this film. The inclusion of the special features are nice to have as well. Fans of the film will enjoy it but those looking for a top notch transfer will be disappointed. It's a worthwhile film even if it doesn't completely succeed at all times due to the language barrier and Production issues with Werner.",1491091200,3,3897,4.926829268292683

226171,4,6300184250,"This has been one of my favorite science fiction movies for a long time. I remember seeing it in the theater (my older brother took me to see it). ""Farenheit 451"" is based on one of Ray Bradbury's best novels. The main character, Montag, is a fireman, who, in this dystopian society, protects society by burning books. The film portrays the society very well. I've always loved the portrayals by Oskar Werner (Montag) and Julie Christie (Linda Montag / Clarisse). Werner's portrayal of the questioning Montag has always fascinated me. And Julie Christie's portrayal of both the character of Linda, Montag's wife, as well as Clarisse who starts Montag questioning things, is amazing.

I marked this down from 5 due to the fact that there are many aspects of the story which are left out of the movie. However, the movie does not really suffer because of the lack of these elements. If you have not read the book, I highly recommend seeing the movie, then reading the book to fill in the gaps.",1477094400,5,991,4.695402298850575

226317,4,6300184250,"This is a very capable adaptation of the novel, especially given the deteriorating relationship between director and screenwriter Truffaut and clunky, sometimes ineffective, lead Oskar Werner. Also complicating things was that an unbelievable wealth of ideas in the novel had to be mined very selectively to make the film. Nevertheless, Truffaut and his team made a sensitive, thought-provoking, and sometimes beautiful film that Bradbury greatly liked. There are three terrific special features on the DVD, and the novelist's participation in all of them is a highlight. Many of us read this book about a kinder gentler dictatorship long ago in high school or college, and it's sometimes hard to tell what's more frightening. That so much of the novel has come true, or that so many of the ugly things that have come to be in our modern, so-called civilized society (i.e., the internet, globalization, Big Data, corporate dictatorship) were beyond the imagination of even a great futurist writer.

About so many things however, Bradbury was amazingly forward-thinking and spot on. His warnings about television, essentially now all but forgotten, were unreservedly prescient. He pulls no punches in exposing television (the wall family) for what it really is: a mind-numbing, anesthetizing fraud. There's a hilarious scene where the evening's TV entertainment is of two men having a manic, interminable conversation, struggling to cover the tiniest details, about the seating arrangement at an upcoming dinner partyin other words, about absolutely nothing  complete pointlessness. It all takes place on a big, wall-mounted flat screen, and everybody wants as many wall families in the home as he can afford. Sound familiar? It makes one recall Reynolds Price's line about the undergraduates coming into his classroom at Duke with their poor television-devastated brains.

A few thoughts on how this writing genre got from there to here. In the wake of the horrific atrocities of two world wars in the 20th century, there emerged a scientific movement (social science, or behaviorism) with the benevolent aim of understanding causes of war, building a just society, and preventing appalling global conflicts. Two of the most famous isms to appear were socialism and communism. To achieve the mass cooperation needed for their version of widespread economic development, it was presumed that sophisticated methods for compliance with the new doctrine would be needed, such as shaping or controlling thought rather than using coercion. Around the world there grew enormous concerns that using science (generally used to understand physical realities) to create political systems (social realities) would produce an unwanted mutationa new kind of dictatorship, a Frankenstein. Or maybe folks simply believed that all people of these isms were Godless savages.  In any event, the fear was so intense that it influences anti-communism right up to the present day. At that time, a group of writers published quite a lot on the insidious methods of the new dystopia. In Bradbury's book, the government doesn't control people by controlling information through propaganda. It controls people through mass ignorance: drugs, television, and the banning of all printed words.  Yup.

It all seems a bit mad, and it begins to hit very close to home.  But Bradbury and the film do maintain a sense of humor. Have some fun looking for the anachronisms, odd color schemes, and the film-makers' obvious disdain for modernist design (poor van der Rohe).  There are also occasional brief shots, in a fully remastered film, shown unrestored. For those who think one would never see this kind of official misology in the modern world: When you see politicians, in the U.S. and elsewhere, rail against elites and their damnable ideas, the message is that knowledge will get you nowhereexactly the government's position in Fahrenheit. You may not see state of the art special effects in this film, but expect a lot of food for thought of that sort. Bradbury once said that films today are brilliant technologically, But you come out aching, and you're hungry.  You haven't seen anything.  With Truffaut, you've seen something.

The films thesis is clear and burning hot.  The real threat is ignorance of thoughts and feelings, whether imposed by the few or freely chosen by the many.  True, most people aren't interested in a lifetime of deep thinking, but the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction.  Its a bizarre irony that in a world of mass public education, there are so many people content to disconnect from books, plays, articles, poetry, all kinds of written words and the life-affirming thoughts and feelings, both positive and negative, that they containcontent to turn off leaning.  And to disconnect from those thoughts and feelings is to disconnect from the two things that define what it means to be human in the most fundamental sense.  When we disconnect from thoughts and feelings, we become intellectually and emotionally ignorant, we fail to understand self, and become disconnected from both self (alienated) and others (atomized). Thats the world of Fahrenheit 451, in some ways resembling our own world.  So that it's not learning for some abstract elitist purpose. It's learning for the purpose of connecting with thoughts and feelings, both ours and those of others  for the purpose of being human. And in the end, that humanity (simple human decency [Chayefsky]) is all any of us really has in this life.  Writers may be a minority of undesirables crying out in the wilderness, and they may write of pain.  But pain reminds you that you're alive, and there can be no pleasure in life without it.  Becoming comfortable with that reality--learning to cry as well as to laugh--is part of growing up. Literature is the power of memory, our history and future, and our collective thoughts and feelings.  Remove it from your personal life, and those are the things likely lost.  In Fahrenheit, this produces a mostly quiet, compliant, and self-absorbed public. In reality, we know that ignorance is at the heart of alienation, malice, and violence.

Ultimately this isn't at all a story about what the government does. It's about the choices individuals make to remain connected, or not, to their humanness. Much of the film's visual bareness comes to an end in the final scene with the book people. It's one of those moments in cinema when imagery, music, screenplay, and performance--thought and feeling--come together to produce revelation  a sort of spirituality  and something with great pictorial and emotional beauty. Bradbury said, If you have a good film and end it badly, you have a bad film. If you have a medium film and end it beautifully, you have a beautiful film. The book people show us that Fahrenheit 451 is indeed a beautiful film.",1462233600,21,6863,5.16036036036036

226373,4,6300184250,"Fahrenheit 451

The film Fahrenheit 451, directed by Francois Truffaut, is based on the compelling novel written by Ray Bradbury. The film seems to take place in Germany. I say this because all characters seem to have the German accents and some even have the ""typical German appearance."" A prime example of the character that had those traits was Oskar Werner, who casts as the blonde haired, blue eyed, Guy Montag. According to IMDB, we also see Werner in the 1965 film The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. Another very significant actress is Julie Christie, who casts as not one but two very significant roles, Linda Montag, and the book-loving Clarisse. According to IMDB, we also see the beautiful Julie Christie in movies such as Troy (2004) and The Company You Keep (2012). The film was full of incredible character development and plot. This movie certainly did the book justice. FN
The main character Guy Montag faces an inner conflict with himself. He decides as a fireman that he does not want to burn books anymore. His wife Linda gives Montag an ultimatum, her or the books. It's far too dangerous and risky to keep the books hidden in their home. Once Montag realizes his neighbor Clarisse hasn't been imprisoned, she tries to convince Montag to come with her to live with the book people. When the fireman show up to Montag's home, Montag burns Beatty down and kills him. Here, Montag has to run, die, or be imprisoned. Montag chooses to run away, and start a new life with the book people. He begins to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes; every member must memorize their own book. AB

The characters in the film and book have similarities and differences. Guy Montag seems to be more passionate and desperate in the book but in the movie, he appears clueless and not very serious or believable when expressing his thoughts or ideas. Considering the fact the directors and actors couldn't replicate the book exactly the actor who played Montag was fitting because we got to see him change and have a different view on the world like he did in the book which I thought was pretty nice. Clarisse McClellan in the book compared to the film was accurate in personality overall but not in physical appearance. In the book, she was portrayed to be 17 years old but in the film, she was 20 years old. She also seemed to be more beautiful in the book in Montag's eyes. In the film, she also seemed to be unbelievable and kind of ""ditzy"". Mildred or ""Linda"" Montag was pretty accurate in the book compared to the film. The main thing that is a bit irritating was the fact that her name was changed from Mildred in the book to Linda in the film. Captain Beatty also known as the Captain was also a nice portrayal in the film from the book. In the film he wasn't as intimidating and scary as Montag saw him in the book. In the film, he also didn't smoke as he did in the book that was not a big part but noticeable. In conclusion, I think the characters in the film were pretty believable and nice portrayals for the characters in the book due to great acting quality and choice of actors. AU
The main confrontation in this movie is Montag's conflict with what he wants, and believes to be true, and what the totalitarian society he lives in wants and believes is right. Virtue is found in this movie in Montag's willingness to do what he believes is right and good despite what everyone else thinks. A vice is found in the entire premise of this society, this society is anything g but virtuous, it reveals the pits of humanity the absolute worst qualities we see in ourselves. The theme of this movie is which is right, and what is wrong, is reading right or wrong, or is only watching TV and popping pills all day long right or wrong? The moral premise of this movie is very similar to the theme; it is that reading is good and is the right thing to do not TV, and pill popping. ZO
There were some special effects used in the movie. The main effect used in the film revolved around fire and imagery. They showed close-ups of books slowly burning at one point of the film. This was a great effect and added to the effect of the film. The use of setting was also a good effect. The fire station they used in the film was fitting. It seemed futuristic and also secluded. Going into this film you have to realize that the film is dated and some of the effects are going to be cheesy. At one point of the film it shows three men flying around on jetpacks and it looks absolutely terrible. Going into this film you have to expect that a little bit. The use of effects and imagery overall was good. JD",1452816000,,4599,4.441420118343196
226374,3,6300184250,"Fahrenheit 451, the movie filmed in 1966, was directed by Francois Truffaut.  According to Google, other movie films Truffaut has directed are Antione and Colette, Love at Twenty, A story of water, and many more.  This movie, Fahrenheit 451 was not too bad quality for the time it was produced, it included special effects such as darkening the edges of the screen and also men flying using jetpacks. The men that were ""flying"" were being held by ropes, yes the ropes were noticeable, but it was still good effects for being 1966. The only credits given are to the director and the screenwriters. Francios Truffaut and Jean-Lours Richard are the screenwriters, and Ray Bradbury was the writer of the novel. Without Truffaut, Richard, and Bradbury, the movie Fahrenheit 451 wouldn't have been the success it was in 1966.

  Fahrenheit 451 starts off with firefighters who start fires instead of putting them out. The movie starts off with the dilemma of a firefighter who burn books, although a particular fireman keeps some of his own. In this dystopia, it is against the rules to have books, and or read them. A firefighter named Guy Montag decides to keep books with him to read secretly. Due to the depression in the house of the Montags, Lynda decides to take some sleeping pills, which leaves Montag in a dangerous place. Which makes him question if he is happy or not. The depression in the house breaks apart the whole story, where Montag gets into reading books, and reading books or having possession of, results in death or prison. Finally, Montag gets caught with books, his wife leaves him and is forced to burn down his house. Then he is forced to run away from society where he meets a group of individuals with knowledge of the train tracks. In the end, Montag learns that he can read, he just has to keep it to himself, in his head.

  The movie is made up of four main characters who are Montag, Clarisse, Linda, and Beatty.  Montag was the main character who was a tough firefighter in the beginning with an obsession with burning books.  But as the story goes on his character changes into rounded character with stronger morals.  The Crystals of the story was Clarisse; she was animated character.  Her hair was short and blond, and she was a rather slender body type.  Linda had long hair and a beautiful face, but she didn't have the wits to match her beauty.  Beatty is an old firefighter with experience that you can see in his eyes.  When on his bad side he will stop at nothing to try and take you down. The overall acting of the movie portrayed the message very well, but the acting was rather cheesy.

  The moral premise of Fahrenheit 451 was that knowledge that contradicts the law is considered dangerous. Therefore reading books gives you the information of the motivation to rebel against your government. Montag tries to bring back the books by an attempt to persuade people that books give you the power to develop your thoughts. When Montag tries to read a poem to Linda and her friends. But their moral premise is that books are wrong for making them feel sad instead of happy. In the end, books make our society better. People learn that books are meant to teach us about the past and what we can learn from it to prepare for the future.

  In the movie, Fahrenheit 451 imagery is used throughout the film with the colors in the movie portraying a gloomy feel to it. Showing a little how Montag feels because he is not happy. When Montag meets Clarisse, she is a different person and lights in his life.  Books symbolize that new ideas are wanted, and nobody likes change. People only want to hear what is in their comfort zone and censor out the rest. Flying policemen and fireman pole that shoots men up are special effects that display the innovative ideas of the current period giving us a sense that this movie is in the future society.

  Guy Montag is simply the hero of the film. He wanted to read and own books; not just the books themselves but the knowledge as well. The laws and morals of his society interrupted him of doing so at his leisure. There are no allies; Guy Montag's wife turned against him and reported his collection of books. When the officials discover the books, Montag murders the captain fireman and is forced to flee. Everyone has the feeling of being disrespected and betrayed, but Montag's wife tried to have him and his books burned and abandoned him.",1452729600,,4424,4.612244897959184
226432,4,6300184250,"My overall impression of the movie is it was very well depicted by the book. The character Guy Montag played by Oskar Werner was very well done. His character fit the role amazingly. I also think that the role Clarisse McClellan was very well played by Julie Christie. The movie was very well consistent; it kept me thinking what would happen next, at the edge of my seat. The overall story behind it all amazing to see. Also, very dramatic scenes kept me thinking what would happen to all the characters.
Two of the biggest and most seen actors in Fahrenheit 451 were Oskar Werner (Montag) and Julie Christie (Linda Montag/Clarisse). Julie played the biggest role because she played two people in one movie. Montag's role to the viewer is, at first, a bad guy, but later learns to appreciate books, and he becomes a book person in the end. The acting quality of both of these actors is very talented overall. Thought that they did a wonderful job in the movie
 Montag is a firefighter who lives in an isolated society where books have been outlawed by the government who doesn't want the people to think freely. The firefighter's duty is to burn any books on sight.
 The moral premise is that there is no trust or love in people relationships. Montag doesn't have a good relationship with his wife or neighbors. His neighbors also don't have good relationships with their spouses. If Montag and his neighbors had better relationships with each other no one would be mad and Linda wouldn't have told the firemen he had books.
 Fahrenheit 451 is filled with hidden meanings and messages. Finding these messages and meanings can be very challenging but also fun. The scene I will talk about is when Montag and the rest of the firemen have found a library in a house that was hidden from view. They take the book and start covering it in gasoline. The lady living there sets herself and her books on fire. As the books burn, tons of great literature and history can be seen burning and then she collapses. This scene proves that she is fine with dying with her books, but you could also say that the greatest book is truly getting burnt and killed the human experience. Montag proves this fact when he burns the police chief after he tries to take his book.
 Montag realizes that he and his wife are not connected, they don't have feelings for one another anymore.

I think this was the only color pic ever made by French director Franois Truffaut, and the first he ever made in English.  If you want to see Truffaut himself in action, watch for him as the likable French scientist in the 1977 movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

It was a miscalculation to cast Julie Christie in dual roles. The special effect of a flying police patrol is laughably amateurish.

The casting of Julie Christie in two roles ( the betraying wife and the idealistic young neighbor) is almost too confusing to sort out.

It asks, what type of world would we be living in if fire departments did not put out fires but set fires and books were what they burned. Books and more specifically the knowledge they contained, were dangerous. Far better to keep ideas and information out of people's minds than to let them become discontented with what was going on in the world.  Better to keep them busy or medicated. What happens when someone questions this process or takes subtle action  against it is what the film shows us.  Julie Christie plays two characters.

226931,5,6300184250,"This one film begins to describe our current age.  We are building a population of illiteracy, like it or not.  TV seems to have taken over our free time.  Look at the record of educational issues in this country.  Years ago I would have never thought of mature human beings purchasing illustrative books, and yet there are whole sections of them in Barnes and Noble.  We even feel educated by what shows up on contemporary entertainment.  Personally I don't think this film is as far fetched as you might believe.  I am not being sarcastic.  I loved Ray Bradbury science fiction when I was younger, and I believe he even has insight now.  This film is good and the book is very good. There used to be a term ""The Well Read Man or Woman"".  It means a person who reads a lot of diverse books and can express themselves thoughtfully.  Are these kind of people around any more.  I hear conversations around me that seem to come off of CNN, MSNBC, or Nightly News.  It seems that TV is establishing our culture.  That's good for TV but it leaves a trail of people unable to communicate reflectively.

226989,5,6300184250,"This is a tale set in the future where the socialist state is complete in its control of society. Firemen work for the state to hunt for books which are now all forbidden to read or own. Buildings are fireproofed and firemen no longer put out fires. They burn books instead.

Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman who methodically plies his trade. But one day he comes to the realization of just how meaningless his life is after he meets a young woman who reads the banned books he burns. With mounting curiosity, Montag deliberately sneaks a book into his kit while on a book burning run. He soon discovers himself through his little library of banned books, and the incredible thougts and feelings they kindle in his once lifeless soul.

I won't give away the ending, but as one who loves books and maintains his own private library of 1000 books, I keep returning to this film for its object lessons about socialism, the dangers of the state, and the condition of man. If you are a fan of 1984, Animal Farm, or Lord of the Flies you MUST see Fahrenheit 451. It is not as grim as 1984 or Lord of the Flies but it raises my passion for books.

Interesting tidbits:

The title of Ray Bradbury's internationally acclaimed novel, and Francois Trufaut's controversial film - Fahrenheit 451 - is the temperature at which book paper burns.

226993,5,6300184250,"The First time I saw this movie was on the Sci-Fi Channel a long time ago. I had no idea what it was called; but it looked so cool and it sure didn't look like a movie from the late 60's. I do not know that much about Ray Bradbury, but this movie fascinated me. I guess because I loved learning about WW2. I couldn't imagine a world without books, and in Nazi Germany they did burn books and other mindless things. This movie reminds me of a movie that came out later Equilibrium. I think both of this movies are excellent in there own ways, but Fahrenheit is much better. This is a movie that takes the main character a firefighter, an antagonist in the beginning; and turns him into the protagonist. Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent movie with a great message, I would recommend this movie to anyone, to me it is a futuristic  sci-fi drama, with a great ending. It's up to you to see if it has the same affects on you, take a chance a watch it you won't be disappointed :D.

Not for the everyday person this movie/book is for those who are willing to see the world for what is is otherwise the translation may be absolutely lost as it was on a much younger me.
Very thought provoking and entertaining as such.",1397779200,,422,4.072289156626506
227021,4,6300184250,"Okay, so the reason I bought this movie was because I wanted to see how close this sixties vision of the future came to capturing the world as we now know it.  For this reason, I will spare criticism of the uninspired performances by Christie and Werner as well as criticism of un-continuities such as the reasons why Werner's ""Montag"" character may or may not be sufficiently literate to be able to read the Dicken's novel, ""David Copperfield"" which he ""liberates"".  I will also give Truffaut a pass regarding the artistic success or failure of this, his first color, first English language feature film.
While watching the film, what I was most conscience of were the similarities between the alienated, totalitarian society of ""Farentheit 451"" and the world in which we live today.  I was struck visually by the ""wall screen"" TV which is pretty much a dead ringer for the 72"" HiDef screens of today.  Also the content of the programming bore a striking resemblance to the inane reality based shows of today's TV listings.  This part is particularly interesting because back in the sixties, ""Reality TV"" consisted pretty much exclusively of variety shows and game shows.  Montag's wife, Linda, is drawn completely into a totally artificial and nonsensical TV ""world"" where she aspires to be ""popular"" enough to be included in ""the Family"".  Her attraction to seeking a dysfunctional and phony ""relationship"" with the characters inside the TV is strikingly similar to the dysfunctional ""relationships"" we can observe today for people who endlessly pursue information about the lives of celebrities and who become emotionally attached to this information about people who are not even aware of the existence of their distant admirers.
And it does seem to me that there is a malevolent goal in this remote, TV ""mind control"".  This goal seems to be the stifling of any capacity for thought (any thought, critical or otherwise) plus the suppression of, and discouragement from, collecting any useful information necessary for mature, adult decision making.  So, whereas in the film, it is books which are actively sought out and destroyed by the State, in today's world it is accurate data, legitimate information flow, and a relevant agenda of topics for discussion which are actively destroyed; same goal, same outcome, very slightly different strategy and tactics.  The result, of course, is the destruction of the person as ""citizen"" and the remolding of the person into a ""consumer"" and obedient ""worker"".
Also, in the movie, I think it is quite perceptive, that the person who betrays Montag to the authorities is not his antagonistic fellow fireman (played by the always sinister appearing, Anton Diffring), but his wife, Linda; the person ostensibly the closest to him.  In other words, we are betrayed by our family and friends as often as by our enemies...how chilling, and how true.
I don't mean to suggest that the film has no redeeming technicals.  Cyril Cusack does a very nice job as the psychopathic/split personality disordered Firehouse Captain.  Also, the special features section included in the dvd is worthwhile, too.  It contains commentary by Julie Christie (who proves herself to be more perceptive than one might expect) as well as other people involved in the production of the movie such as Ray Bradbury himself.  It is interesting to listen to this commentary because it seems to have been put together fairly recently, so that makes it relevant to the present environment.
Overall, this dvd is likely to be a welcome addition to the library of anyone concerned with pondering contemporary issues facing us as we are forced into a membership with the emerging National Security Police State.",1396915200,3,3718,5.072131147540984

The German Blu-ray was knocked for poor picture quality because it used a transfer from a dated source. Both the book and film are well worth owning but it goes without saying the book is superior. Interestingly, Sam Weller noted that Bradbury ""predicted everything from flat-panel televisions to iPod earbuds and twenty-four-hour banking machines."" Bradbury usually claimed that the real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. This was director Franois Truffaut's first color film and his only English language film. Unfortunately, the film dropped almost all of the science fiction elements present in the book. However, author Ray Bradbury said in later interviews that, despite its flaws, he was pleased with the film.

227140,3,6300184250,"This movie gets the point across from the book, but the story is quite different. It's really about communism and the destruction of literature, as in 1984.

The movie leaves out a lot of significant elements of the story that were in the book (Mr. Faber, the mechanical hound) and merges a lot of events together to save time. It also makes it look like Montag has more of a relationship with the neighbor girl than he does in the book, while his wife (mildred in the book, Linda in the movie) knows nothing of it. This neighbor girl, by the way, is in the book a 17-year-old student named Clarisse, while in the movie she is a 20-year-old teacher; in the book she is killed at a certain point (an important part of the story), while in the movie she is alive through the end. I was disappointed that Mr. Faber was not mentioned once, but a short, wordless event early in the movie suggests that a certain older man in a park was supposed to be him.

227142,5,6300184250,"This gem of a moive keeps its relevancy decades after its release.  Truffaut based his work on the Ray Bradbury novel ""Fahrenheit 451"", although it has some a few striking differences.  Fahrenheit 451 degrees is of course the temperature at which books ignite.  Montag is the aspiring 'fireman"" whose job it is to find and burn books.  Books are banned because they ""make people unhappy.""  He lieves in a police state in which the the passions of the population are controlled by the ubiquitous televisions.  In a brilliant move, Truffaut has cast the same actress as Montag's throroughly endroctrinated wife and his new friend who belongs to an outlier group.  The acting is low key but resonates.

The special effects are hokey, but I think this sets the exact right tone.  This society could exist at any point.  Like Stalin's Russia, the authorities scarcely need to spy.  The populace will inform on any odd members.  The fire truck is prosaic to the point of complacency.  More startling however is the huge flat screen TV in each home, an exotic touch to 1966.  One wonders what Truffaut and Bradbury would think of the information age.  The question this movie raises is the loss of the individual voice of each book when media is distracting and formidable.  People have certainly always wished to be taken out of their own negative feelings, and this lesson is as fresh today as ever.",1385942400,,1394,4.794117647058823

227247,3,6300184250,"Last month I read the book to myself and listened to the audiobook with my fifteen year old son for our homeschool. As always, we watched the movie afterward.

My review will not rehash the book and its message. Here I review the movie, which we watched on Amazon Instant Streaming.

Of course they changed things up a bit, some parts were different due to lack of special effects to replicate the book, since this was made in 1966, nearly 50 years ago. The scene of the chase of Montag near the river was downright hysterical due to poor quality special effects. My older son was right, even before we saw this he proclaimed it's time for a re-make. When reading the book I imagined a visually dark story with accurate full wall televisions and a scary mechanical hound and a full on chase scene such as we are used to in action movies today.

Other parts were different such as making Clarisse 20 years old and almost a love interest rather than a hippie-like philosophical deep thinking 17 year old high school girl.

The zombie state of the TV watchers was not conveyed enough in the movie.

I didn't think the movie conveyed the misery and complete detachment of Montag and his wife Linda.

The scenes were gray (filmed in winter) and attempted to show modern architecture but when reading the book I imagined more blackness and grimness rather than 1960s era modern clean line contemporary housing.

The main points about the value of books and authors speaking through books to the reader were made clear in the movie, although I felt the nature of the value of thinking was not as clear. By that I mean, for years I'd heard that the point of the book was to tell about book burning but when I read the book I realized the story is more about thinking, freedom of thought, and the value of education as free thinkers, most of which back then were achieved by reading books. The book burning was not the main point, the main point was learning and thinking and talking with conversation, and not being only living induced into an isolated zombie state by watching TV 24/7. The book reminded me of today's multiple use of screens by individuals within one home and the use of earbuds in individual devices to tune into one's own private entertainment world.

In the movie they played up school as robotic recitation of math facts and wearing uniforms and being an unhappy uninspiring place. Clarisse working as a teacher who tried to infuse fun in learning then being fired makes a point. That was not in the book. I don't mind it in the movie, I'm just comparing how they are different.

As to the look of the firemen, they did all look similar, blonde and fair and to me seemed to resemble German Nazis including all speaking with a German accent (when others in the movie did not speak with that same accent). The uniforms also made them look like Nazis. This perhaps was the influence of people in the 1960s feeling that evil in the world could easily be represented by copying the look of the Nazis. I imagine if the movie were remade today by Americans the firemen would not need to look like Nazis or speak with a German accent to imply that they are evil-doers, that could be achieved by lighting, music, costumes, and the set's appearance.

Anyhow please someone, remake this movie and scare us with fantastic graphics and dark lighting and moving music while also getting across the point of the book. With today's special effects this could be an action movie that draws many views while also making them think and teaching them something (hopefully).",1364428800,2,3567,4.603149606299213

227335,5,6300184250,"The following review is for Universal's DVD of FAHRENHEIT 451, not the Amazon Instant Video:

The best science-fiction will at least have some kind of ongoing relevance, and at times even a striking accuracy in its prediction of things to come. Francois Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's best-selling novel, FAHRENHEIT 451, is seeing a disturbing fulfillment of sorts in our day.

Effectively set in an unspecified future, the story involves a society where books are banned and people have submitted to interactive technology to the point that their thinking is almost totally influenced by electronic  media. Homes are under government surveillance, so that any house without a TV antennae is a sure sign of non-conformism, and hence a threat to the ""good"" of the community. People have become dependent on pills as a result of real or imagined neuroses. Ironically, the fire department's duty isn't putting out fires, but starting them - and books are the evil kindling to be consumed. One fireman, Montag (Oskar Werner), questions the morality of his job, so much so that he begins to hide books in his house causing his shallow, conformist wife (Julie Christie) to leave him. Sharing Montag's passion for a better world is a school teacher (Christie again, in a dual role), who is a member of a secret society that is committed to preserving our printed heritage and capacity for individual thought.

The parallels between FAHRENHEIT 451 and our current obsession with interactive technology and reality TV are uncanny, and the film's negative depiction of this is perhaps lost on anyone under 30 today. As products of the cyber-space revolution, younger people don't see what the big deal is about burning books since they probably do all their reading off a smart phone anyway. It's become normal to tune out the world with ear-phones, just like Montag's wife does, so what? If you don't have the latest gadgetry you're labled as ""weird"", really just another term for non-conformism. We're pressured to buy into a system of censored thinking called ""political correctness"". Public libraries and the postal service are in big trouble today, thanks to e-books and e-mail. People are stressed out by a way of life that was supposed to lessen anxiety, and try to cope with it by popplng pills. In all of this, Bradbury's novel and Truffaut's film were spot-on.

FAHRENHEIT 451 has a distinctly Hitchcockian atmosphere, which isn't surprising since Truffaut was an avid admirer of the Master of Suspense's work. Composer Bernard Herrmann, who scored several Hitchcock films, also did the music for FAHRENHEIT 451, which ranks among his finest.

 The film is punctuated with some remarkable imagery, especially the shots of the books' pages curling up as if in agony as they're engulfed in the flames. There's a strange, poetic beauty that Truffaut manages to convey within the ominous context of the story, so that a glimmer of hope for the future eventually surfaces at the end of the film.

Both Oskar Werner and Julie Christie give sensitive, moving performances, with Christie doing twice as good in an inspired choice of casting as both Werner's misguided wife and his trusted soulmate.

FAHRENHEIT 451 is science-fiction at its most insightful and socially relevant, and I highly recommend it.",1346716800,,3317,5.082720588235294
227336,5,6300184250,"This was one of the only books I was forced to read as a child in school that I truly loved.  I love to read but I find I often hated the books selected by schools for children to read.  Considering how dull most of the literature is that children are made to read in high school it tends to make me wonder how I, and others, maintain our love of literature.

But Ray Bradbury's world and his writing style kept me hooked and made me a fan over fifteen years ago and I am still a fan of his work now.  I am saddened that he is gone now but his writing will love on forever as he was our generation's H. G. Wells.

This book was surprisingly accurate to the world of today, to political correctness run rampant, to the opressiveness of censorshhip, and to our shallow obsession with better technology.  This is one book that will never truly be antiquated.  Read it, understand it, and appreciate it.

227338,4,6300184250,"The theme is all too familiar, that being the State attempting to control the people through pervasive means without respect to privacy.  Some citizens resist this form of dictatorship, yet their brothers and sisters will be compelled to turn them in.  The subtlety that fuels this is something that can be missed, with the overshadowing of the fireman's hunt.  There is a moment where the chief tells Montag that it was the people who wanted books to be burned, not the State.  The State is only complying with this, albeit in a single-minded fashion.  But why would the people want books to be burned?

This story was written in the 1950's and the movie made in 1966, but the commentary it makes about society is still quite poignant today.  In Bradbury's world, people crave to be the same and enshrouded in perpetual happiness.  The trouble with books is that they make people unhappy.  Books tell of imaginary lives that one can't ever live.  They postulate many philosophies that clash with one another.  They breed strife, disorder, disharmony, and unhappiness.  So, they must be dispensed with.

Today, our society is so inundated with over-stimulation from so many different sources simultaneously.  People are so accustomed to getting their information quickly and in short bursts (e.g. Twitter's 160 character messages). Movies, sitcoms, Internet videos, video games, and social networking dominate the media landscape, so who wants to be bothered with reading books?  With so many distractions, there is so little time to really live life.  To really get to know people, instead of talking through vague and diffused interactions via emotionless message segments.  Also, we are fast becoming an over medicated society.  The pharmaceutical industry is more profitable than ever before.  Are you depressed?  There's a pill for that.  Want to lose weight?  There's a pill for that.  How aptly the book and movie forecasts what is to come.

""Fahrenheit 451"" touches on so many aspects to issues in society that merit attention, where the burning of books is almost an incidental side effect.  This was Truffaut's only English speaking film and he was not pleased with how the dialog and actor interactions turned out.  He called them ""flat.""  So this wasn't his directorial intent, yet what a stroke of luck, as this effect really captures how people have become mostly flat.  I got a much more humanized feeling from the characters who read and become books in this movie.  At first I felt Julie Christie's performance wasn't distinctive enough between the two characters (Linda and Clarisse), yet in retrospect I think this kind of works.  Although Clarisse is a bit of a rebel and craving to be different, she is also a product of society and has a bit of blandness or flatness to her character.  Yet, like everyone else, she also has the potential to become so much more.

One other enjoyable aspect of this movie is the ""retro futuristic"" impression it captures.  From the SAFEGE suspension monorail, to the wall sized interactive video screens, there is definitely an impression of this being a future time, yet there are still plenty of signs of 1960's British production values.  I had rented this movie and neglected to look at the bonus materials, but have since learned that there are some excellent behind the scenes material and interviews with cast/crew back when it was made.",1341446400,,3398,4.987544483985765

For example, their transportation (aerial trams) is commonplace today at all amusement parks and most major cities; and the same for large plasma screen televisions, and Skype. Therefore, the movie was a little boring to my students; consequently, to encourage their interest, I had my students identify items that were futuristic in the 1960's that we now use everyday.",1340928000,,630,5.116504854368932
227341,5,6300184250,"One of the ironies of this film is that the book people, who keep books alive by memorizing them, also burn the books, just like the firemen.

The irony is that human beings are fleeting, mortal creatures, while books, if preserved, will always outlive human beings. Hitler's burning of the books (and the commentators correctly point out that there are many references to Hitler in the movie) did nothing to stop the eternal proliferation of books. When we are all dead, the books will remain. They are far less mortal than we are.

One of the collaborators in the special features expressed concern about this final scene, fearing it would come across as ""hokey"" or moralizing. That fear was justified. The scene doesn't quite work.

Another commentator points out that the book people, walking around separately at the end of the movie, don't communicate with each other but simply keep repeating the lines of the books they have memorized. This puts us right back into the totalitarian world of the movie, where the laws prohibit real communication and consign the individual to a narcissistic solitude (viz. the people caressing themselves on the train).

I think the ending is flawed, yet oddly haunting because of the combined futility and devotion of the book people. They have dedicated themselves to an impossible task, the preservation of literature by a mortal race. One raises one's eyebrows at the unlikelihood of the scene, but in the end one accepts it as part of the human dilemma depicted in the film. How to be human in a social world which discourages humanity. A universal dilemma.",1340409600,,1602,4.9222222222222225

If you look at the credits none of the actors were Americans.  Second, get over yourself.  Americans are not the only people in the world that make and watch movies.

Someone had complained about the special effects.  This was not Back Draft!  What sort of special effects are required to show the character burning books????

As for those who complain about it not following the book.  Movies rarely satisfy those who read the book.  That is because when reading a book you interpret the descriptions of characters and events based on your imagination and experience whereas what you see in the movie is how the director interprets each scene which may not match your interpretation. And of course there may be parts of the book that are not transferred to the screen due to time and budget concerns.  So get real!",1339027200,,1221,4.587962962962963

My first reason, of course, is Truffaut's film style and Bernard Herrmann's haunting film score, one of his saddest and most beautiful.

But it is also very very scary to see how much of Truffault's (not Bradbury's) fears and warnings have gone unheaded.  Today, we sit in front of huge wall-screens that either tell us what we should think or teach us to be afraid (all in the guise of ""entertainment"" or ""news"").  We have people in uniforms that go through our bags and feel all over our bodies (including a pregnant woman's belly).  We have a society that is anesthetized to violence and the invasion of other people's privacy and even their rights.  We have a growing population that doesn't read anything anymore that's longer than a ""byte"" of information or doesn't devote the extended time that reading novels or essays would take, so truly nuanced and developed thinking is at risk of growing rarer and rarer.

227375,5,6300184250,"For an in-depth description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...

This movie was recommended to me by a friend here on Amazon, so I was curious to check it out.  This movie is based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Ray Bradbury (""Something Wicked This Way Comes"").  Anybody who knows me personally knows that I like old movies.  I also like offbeat movies.  Really, offbeat anything.  Fahrenheit 451 (1966) fits that mold.  This movie's plot is basically about how mass media and television contribute to peoples' waning interest in reading books/literature.  This is so true.  Today more than ever we are bombarded by mass media and so many entertainment and television/news outlets that it seems that fewer and fewer people have the patience and the attention span to sit down and read a book.  Instead, people resort to receiving small amounts of information (which a lot of times is inaccurate and scaled down) from television and the mass media that they accept as fact.  A great deal of the time this information is either not accurate at all or is very condensed.  The result is that people are receiving only partial information that they end up accepting as complete and thorough facts.

Here's a good example:  Somebody can watch some short program on TV about the Civil War, where only a few pieces of information are presented, and the viewer will think they know all about the Civil War.  If there are factual errors in the TV program, the viewer will never know it and just take what they viewed and heard at face value.  In order to gain a high level of knowledge about the Civil War, one must read a well-written book on the subject, but unfortunately people these days don't want to do that.  That's basically the crux of what this movie is about.  This movie has been open to various interpretations, another which is that the burning of books is meant to suppress opposing ideas by the masses.  There's a lot more to the plot, but I don't want to give anything else away.  Watch to find out how this classic movie unfolds.

If you like offbeat movies, then give this one a spin in your DVD player.  Highly recommended.",1331078400,,2197,4.591259640102828

The story begins in a firehouse. Firemen slide down a pole to man their fire truck. Where's the fire? A telephone call warns a man: ""Get out. Hurry!"" The firemen enter his apartment to find a hidden book, then many more! The books are piled up and then incinerated while a crowd watches. [No laws against open-air burning?] Montag travels home on an elevated train. 451F is the temperature where paper burns. A long time ago firemen put out fires instead of burning books. ""Books are just so much rubbish."" ""Why is it forbidden?"" ""It makes people unhappy."" [Note the style of the houses.] Will a raise mean more money for a second wall screen? The TV announces a book count of destroyed contraband. The truth in a story is purely coincidental. Interactive TV? People talk to their TV (as some people do today). Linda takes a pill and watches TV. We see firemen slide up the poll.

The alarm goes off. Student firemen are told about hiding places for books. They hide books for a lesson in finding books. When Montag returns home he finds Linda unconscious on the floor. The ambulance is on its way. Linda is completely recovered in the morning, and hungry. [How would they present this scene today?] ""Law enforcement can be fun."" Montag has a secret hobby. Firemen search people in a park for books. That young lady has lost her job. They watch a man in the street. They visit a school next. Montag tells what he did. Late that night Montag's wife finds his books! An alarm calls out the firemen to an old house. Books are thrown to the floor. There is a secret library! ""There's nothing there."" Philosophy is worse than novels. They only make people unhappy with their lives. This house is condemned to burn. That old woman is burned like a sacrificial victim. This upsets Montag and he complains to his wife's guests. He reads a book to them! This creates a shocking scene. Is he well?

Later he has a dream (or nightmare). Montag's wife rearranges the furniture. [Symbolism?] ""They came to take them away."" Their house had no TV antenna. At the firehouse Montag searches the files. Can he get the house after its requisitioned? Montag's wife drops a picture into that red box. That young lady returns to her house. Years ago people used to sit in rocking chairs and talk. There is a hidden village of Book People (each memorized one book). Montag thinks of a way to eliminate the book burners. The firemen go out on a call, it is Montag's house! Montag uses the flame-thrower promiscuously. [We see ""Mad"" magazine among the classics.] There is a conflict. Does a pistol beat a flame-thrower? Montag is now a wanted man. Can he hide near a river? He follows the abandoned railroad into the woods. The TV shows the capture of Montag (another example of faked news). We see the Book People. They memorize books so they can't be physically destroyed. [Is there a flaw in this plan?]

The original story must have been a satire on life in America during the 1950s when people watched TV more and read fewer books. The use of tranquilizers is part of this story. The firemen in this film must have been modeled after the SS of World War II. No mention here of magazines and newspapers, which carry advertising unlike books.

227395,4,6300184250,"Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451"" (1966) was his first film in color as well as his only English language film. The film has a retro look to it with old phones mixed in with advanced technology like flat screen tvs.  Julie Christie also plays two characters in the film which alludes to the fact that the people in her state controlled society have no real personality and so don't differ from one another. This film needs to be viewed more as metaphor than as a literal reality otherwise various elements of the movie might simply seem mystifying, such as when Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) isn't able to ascend the pole in the fire station once he has begun to read and question his society's banning of books, or even how various people at the end of the movie represent a book which they have memorized, which is more of a symbol of human individuality and experience than a literally presented fact. In this way film can be seen as a kind of dark fairy tale about what could happen if people stopped questioning and thinking about the world around them, and therefore how individuality would cease to exist. Ray Bradbury felt that his book, which the movie was based on, was not so much about censorship as about how television destroys people's interest in reading books.

227396,2,6300184250,"Before any discussion of this film, there must be a line drawn between the politics of the film versus the way this film was created.  Being a Truffaut fan, I didn't want to miss his idiosyncrasies within a scene merely because the politics of book burning were overwhelming.  Yes, one understands that this is a film adaptation of ""Fahrenheit 451"", a beloved classic that gives booksellers inspiration every time it is read, but also this is a Truffaut film.  Several reviews state that Truffaut did an excellent job with the direction, and then spend four paragraphs discussing our society and its apathetic ways toward literature.  In this discussion of this film, there will be a solid line between Truffaut's direction and Bradbury's themes.  Was one stronger than the other?  Did Truffaut's adaptation muddy Bradbury's final thoughts?  While you may agree or disagree with my discoveries, one needs to realize that this was a film watched, not a book read.  Did Truffaut satisfy the main discourses of film enjoyment?  Was it entertaining?  Did it spark debate?  Did it decorate strong characters?  For this reviewer, Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451"" was a mixed bag of cinematic delight.  The characters, albeit well fit within the realm of Bradbury, just felt mediocre.  Their direction seemed wooden, while the camera focus seemed misplaced for a majority of the film.  Again, like most Truffaut, it was colorful, but he just didn't seem himself until the final act - where Bradbury's ideas and Truffaut's direction finally congealed together.  ""Fahrenheit 451"" was an adaption, but not one that stands among the infamous.

Our troubles begin in this film with our lead, Guy Montag (played by ""Jules and Jim"" lead, Oskar Werner), who obviously hated working for Truffaut and this project.  Despite the rumor that the two clashed at every opportunity, Werner gave one of the worst performances seen for a long time.  When Truffaut couldn't get Terrance Stamp for his first choice, the lackluster Werner stepped in, and the downfall of this film began.  Werner gave nothing for audiences to attach themselves to.  There was no emotion, no big moment of empathy, no excitement.  Werner went from one scene to the next, allowing his sleepy eyes to provide us with just enough to cope with the hour and a half running time.  He was horrible as a ""Fireman"", and even less convincing as a man with a sudden passion for the written word.  There were moments when laughter was more suitable than viable emotion.  This is supposed to be a tense film, a confusing film, a film where the emotion surrounding books becomes a greater asset than the material objects that Montag possessed.  Alas, this wasn't the case.  With the supposed anger surrounding our lead and director, only the lessons of Styrofoam and cardboard were used.  Thankfully, there was Julie Christie mixed within the story to heighten the side bits.  Feeling a bit Brunel-ian, Christie was used as two characters in this film, providing an opportunity for Truffaut to demonstrate a particular emotion with books and without them.  While Christie wasn't Oscar-worthy, she did allow for an appealing appetizer to the dismal main course (Werner).  She and Cyril Cusack (The Captain), anointed with the task of keeping the film together, managed to save this film from utter disappointment to sheer mediocrity.

What makes ""Fahrenheit 451"" an interesting film to self-explode, is not only the odd direction by Truffaut, but the powerful camera work by one Nicolas Roeg (the man who later gave us ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"").  All of the colors, the shots as they were filmed, and the choices of camera placement were, possibly, the second only greatest moment of this film.  I credit Roeg for giving us the unsettling feel of this film.  The contrast from the bold colors of red in the community with the bland colors of inside Montag's home (and elsewhere) forced the setting upon us in a good way.  As Truffaut and Werner were arguing with each other, Roeg was creating a film - and it is obvious as the visuals of this film looked creative, but everything else came nowhere close.

Finally, without giving away the ending, one has to admit that the ending to this film was Truffaut finally finding his way again.  Suddenly, when Montag found his real ""home"", it became obvious that Truffaut found his comfort zone.  He understood this film, and the ending wrapped up brilliantly.  The direction, the voice, the visuals - they all seemed to come together in a way that shocked even myself.  If only the rest of the film had been this way ... what a surprising film this would have been.

VIDEO:  Watched this film via streaming, and it was beautiful in colors and sets.  The remaining part of the film, especially the acting, allowed this film to bob between mediocrity and horrid.

VISUALS:  Again, Roeg is credited for allowing this film to remain what it is today.  It is due to his visuals that I was able to watch this film in its entirety.  Without Roeg, who knows what would have happened.

SOUND:  Decent.  The roar of fire was load.  The crackle of books was present.  The sound of the siren was intense.  The little points were good - don't remember any music that stood out to engulf the theme of the film, but perhaps it was merely Montag's horrid acting that kept it at bay.

EXTRAS:  As I streamed it, alas, nothing to report.

Overall, I believe this film, if done correctly, could be the first science fiction film ever to win an Oscar for best film.  The themes are universal and the looming future is closer than we think.  Yet, Truffaut could not handle this.  He and Werner's arguing created a difficult mess of mixed emotions and sub-par casting.  Roeg's scenes were brilliant, but couldn't save this sinking ship.  ""Fahrenheit 451"" had potential, but failed on nearly every level.  If you choose to view this film, check out the final scene in which Truffaut finally understands Bradbury's work.  Why did it take so long to discover the true meaning of the written page?  Urg.

227417,5,6300184250,"With ""Fahrenheit 451"" the brilliant French director Francois Truffaut made his first film in color and his only on in English. Based on the science fiction classic by Ray Bradbury, it takes place in the future where a totalitarian government is in place. People are forbidden to read. Houses have huge television screens installed in the walls; the inhabitants of this negative utopia take pills to stay on an even keel. Firemen no longer put out fires but rather burn books because they make people think, make them unhappy and, as one character says, ""we above all have got to be alike."" The film stars Oskar Werner as Montag, a fireman who hides books in his home and secretly reads among other novels Charles Dickens' DAVID COPPERFIELD, and Julie Christie who plays two characters, Montag's wife Linda and another secret reader Clarisse.

The cinematography is beautiful, particularly the opening scenes with frame after frame shot in different colors of the roofs of houses with huge television antennas. There are no written credits at the beginning of the movie; a man's voice tells the viewer the stars of the movie, the producer, the director et al. The characters read comic strips with no captions. The title of course comes from the temperature that supposedly book paper burns.

According to the commentary that accompanies the DVD version of this film about the making of ""Fahrenheit 451"" Truffaut used some of his favorite books for the burning scenes: MOBY DICK, Bradbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, ROBINSON CRUSOE, MADAM BOVARY, VANITY FAIR, OTHELLO, LOLITA, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, works by Jean Genet, Frank Harris, Kafka, Henry Miller and many others-- and a cook of crossword puzzles in Spanish!

It hardly bears saying that this film is as timely as both local and world news, past and present. Everyone knows that both the Soviets and Hitler burned books. Churches and other institutions, the so-called keepers of morals, along with private citizens in these United States, have led fights to ban books from schools and libraries over the years. Right now a citizen of Gwinnett County, Georgia is trying to get the Harry Potter novels removed from that county's schools. Furthermore, a recent study showed that one out of five Americans-- I believe-- had not read a single book in the past year. The average family, on the other hand, watches dozens of hours of TV drivel each week while many Americans take tranquilizers and other mood-altering prescription drugs on a daily basis.

I wonder what it says to us today? Possibly quite a lot. The world in which the story takes place does look, superficially, inviting. Maybe this is what it means to be living in a police state? Guy Montag, played with great style by Oskar Werner, is a cool character (and forget the moronic American meaning of the word ""cool"" here), in that he isn't passionate and lives a rather passionless life. Millie Montag, his wife, is played by Julie Christie, who also plays the role of Clarice.

The film is powerful because it rarely overstates its case and keeps the violence to a minimum.

The film was ""futuristic"" in the mid-sixties, when it was made, and it does have a decidedly '60s look about it now. However, it does present us with a people who have forgotten books and get their kicks from very large -interactive TV screens - not that that would ever happen, would it!?",1171756800,5,1021,4.5683060109289615
227423,5,6300184250,"This film had a powerful effect on me. 95% of the people I know don't read books. I met a millionaire not long ago, who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life. Lady Di was reported never to have read anything --- except perhaps fashion mags. My children hardly read, and their husbands and wives certainly don't. My ex-wife never read anything. Her father thought Ulysses was a dirty book. I stopped watching television in 1980, and I own 10,000 books --- but not Fahrenheit 451, which I'd read about 45 years ago. This was long enough for me not to compare the film with Bradbury's text, but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear, and with a very solid punch to the plexus. The manner in which it is written, played and directed, added to its impact. This world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us. The style was strange, but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal. People live and work like automated morons. They can't think for themselves, and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied. They can't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind: in fact, present them with an idea, or attempt to initiate a discussion, and they'll often become angry. Some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts. Ludicrous suggestions: remake it with mad Mel Gibson. Have infantile Spielberg direct it. Bulk it out with computerised SFX. These ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets, and many of them seem unable to understand their own language, let alone write it, or spell it.

227454,5,6300184250,"Francois Truffaut's English language debut ""Fahrenheit 451"" is based on the world famous science-fiction novel by Ray Bradbury and stars Oskar Werner and Julie Christie. The movie is about a world in which books are banned and firemen don't put fires out, but instead burn books. Werner plays Montag, one such fireman who becomes involved with a schoolteacher named Clarisse (Christie), who dares to read. Meanwhile, Montag's wife Linda (also Christie) becomes more and more worried about her husbands reading habits. That's a quick summarization of the film. The movie came out in 1968, but is still as relevant, powerful, and fresh as it was back then. Nothing in the film seems to have aged...The term ""science-fiction"" can turn people off, but in this film that term hardly applies. Truffaut was already world-famous director, who has made French hits like The 400 Blows and Jules & Jim (which starred Werner). Truffaut never mastered the English language, which makes this even more impressive. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to direct a film in a language you hardly understand...Let alone a good film. The casting of Julie Christie in a dual role could have been a dire mistake, but manages to work perfectly. When the two characters are on-screen, I hardly noticed (or cared) that they were the same person. Werner adds a lot of depth to his performance as Montag (a character name that you're not likely to forget), although I'm not sure if he ever did another film in English. The films cinematography is by Nicolas Roeg, who would later direct Walkabout, The Man Who Fell to Earth, and Don't Look Now (also starring Christie) and the film has the mark of a genius. The cinematography here is excellent. I've never read the book, but the movie is extraordinarily powerful. It's a film that everyone should see, and while you're at it...See some other Truffaut films too.

227455,4,6300184250,"I agree with one reviewer who said to read the book...yes, by all means, read the book and then watch this incredible film adaptation. Yes, this film is a little dated - but aren't we all. It's a little cheesy in spots, sure. But I feel that Truffaut really did Bradbury justice especially by making sure that the only things we actually saw in print were the titles of the books that were being burnt.

Both the book and the film are powerful commentaries on society. We really are becoming more and more of a society who wants everything spelled out for us. With all our technology, we have allowed our minds, our hearts, and our souls to grow flaccid and weak. We pledge our allegiance to things that really do not serve our spirit...things that slowly gnaw out our insides and make us hollow inside. I have a friend who recently bought a home that had a very nice set of built in bookcases built into the wall of the den. He took a sledge hammer to them, resurfaced the wall, and put up his 72"" Plasma flatscreen.

I almost cried.

I guess it's because I love to read. I guess it's because I like to feel. I guess it's because I truly feel in the pit of my soul that this journey that we call like is such a magnificent thing, that I am disheartened by all the callousness that we, as a society, have allowed ourselves individually as well collectively to become.

I put up a review not too long ago where some people attacked and judged my enthusiasm for the film. It really kind of bothered me for a bit. Almost to the point where I wanted to stop writing reviews for things that I enjoyed and wanted others to also enjoy. Do you see what I was doing? I was letting other people's opinions have made weight and more validity than my own. That's how a society crumbles. That's how the ""futuristic society"" in Fahrenheit 451 allowed the Law to establish the ban on reading.

We must allow ourselves to rise up out of the ashes of our past and decide who we want to be, what we want to do, what we want to have, and where we want to go. We must do this individually and we must do this collectively. Life is much too precious to simply go on auto-pilot.

I invite you to watch this incredible movie. I invite you to see it with a group of friends. I invite you to think about it, be stirred up about it, and then decide for yourself (while you still can) what kind of life you want to bring forth.

The film is set in a world where books are banned and burnt. Nothing is to be read, except for the numbers on top of the bottles of pills and sedatives people of this age often take. Books have contradicting ideas, the book burning ""firemen"" claim. They make people unhappy sometimes, they change people. Authors are raised on high in the world of literature, as if they are more than the people around them. For a happier society, where everyone can be equal, books must be destroyed, they say. Montag is a fireman, a talented one due for a promotion. He has a wife, he has a large television set in the wall (though most people in this world have two), and he considers himself a pretty happy guy. A young woman approaches him on the monorail home, having seen him around for so long on the trip home she felt she should say hello. She asks about his job, and wonders if he ever read any of the books he burnt. It gets him thinking, and he ends up reading a copy of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens that is due to be torched. Like the Firemen say, it changes his life, and suddenly this happy society seems a little more sinister than before...

I think it's a film that flows really well, has a couple of nice directorial quirks, and has that British 1960s feel in it's sets, landscapes and colour schemes, which I always like. It's kind of strange that it's an English film, since Ray Bradbury, the author of the book is American. Ah well. There's a lot of ideas being toyed with here, the nature of memory, of knowledge, of oral traditions, of control. A lot to think about.

227459,2,6300184250,"My first viewing of Fahrenheit 451 since its initial release in 1966 was last night via DVD.  Any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie. The vehicle that the 451 unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see.  The plot, the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting, minus Montag, whom Oskar Werner plays very well.  The moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some. FAHRENHEIT 451 may be considered a classic to some, but without a remake quick, this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater.

In the future, the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch TV and take drugs. Miserable firefighter Montag, set for a promotion in the 451 book burning unit, takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book. His life then goes upside-down from there.

227460,5,6300184250,"Perhaps one of Truffaut's most ambitious films.  One knows we are in for something special when the opening titles of the movie are spoken rather than written and hints to the innovative approach Truffaut has taken to depicting perhaps Bradbury's most popular novel.

Don't be disappointed with the lack of eyepopping special effects in this film--there really isn't any, yet Truffaut effectively evokes the oppresive and almost totalitarian mood of a society that has banned the practice of reading and the consumption of the written word.

Without sounding redundant singing the praises of the principal actors, Werner, Christie, Cusack, and the underappreciated German actor, Anton Diffring, the film is not an improvement on the novel (unlike Coppola's ""The Godfather"" over Mario Puzo's novel), but a pretty faithful take on Bradbury's vision.  I have no doubt that high school English teachers will find the film a suitable inducement for students to actually read the novel rather than the Cliff Notes.

Christie is superb as both Montag's wife, Linda and mistress, Clarisse, in a dual role that must have been both a challenge and an inspiration. Oskar Werner, perhaps one of the most underestimated actors of the 60's, portrays Montag with conviction and an imposed dimension of uneasiness that the role demands.

The opening scenes of the ""firemen"" setting ablaze a stack of paperbacks confiscated from an apartment and midway to a middle-aged woman's deliberate attempt to incinerate herself along with her collection of books is a disturbing and effective piece of filmmaking while setting the tone for a very chillingly realistic depiction of censorship.

The special features, including a interview/discussion with Bradbury, a lucid and engaging full-length commentary by Julie Christie, and a short documenatry on the musical score by Bernard Hermann are all welcome additions to this DVD.",1160265600,,1903,5.365771812080537
227461,2,6300184250,"I was disappointed when I went back and checked out this 1966 movie version of Ray Bradbury's famous tale about book-burning.  The characters here start off in a world where books and reading are banned. It's an authoritarian world in which the government controls the media. So I had thought this movie made a commentary that would be relevant to the dangerous drift of today's governments. My memory apparently didn't serve me well though. Viewing this Fahrenheit again, I actually found it to be a weak, illogical rendering. I don't think Bradbury could have been too happy with this translation of his story onto the screen.

There are a number of minor awkward elements in this film. There is Oskar Werner's wooden acting. His soft-pedaled delivery was effective in movies such as ""Ship of Fools,"" where it conveyed a romantic world-weariness. But here his discovery of the powers of reading calls for, if not necessarily a Helen Keller-like shriek of recognition of the power of The Word, at least some joyful animation as he has the new world between the covers of a book opening up to him. But we don't get any of that from Werner. He remains on murmuring monotone throughout.

Also, he learns to read altogether too fast. Assuming he had had no significant previous exposure to the written word, how could he then be reading Dickens, with all its Victorian archaism, in such a short time? Of course I can understand how the producers/directors of this movie would have wanted to cut to the chases and not bog down into static reading lessons. But actually, seeing the process of someone teaching himself to read would have been far more interesting than what does make it onto the screen.

Then that selection of Dickens as a turning point in people's lives strikes a completely false note. Werner finally turns on at least one of his wife's pals to the joy of literacy by reading from Dickens. However the passage he recites is a very pedestrian one, something unlikely to move anyone to turn away from the TV, much less to gush bittersweet tears at realization of all the years of having been denied access to this wonder.

Also, the way people are depicted in their pre-literate state is nonsensical. They are shown stroking, stroking themselves, as if making up for some sensory deprivation they vaguely know they are suffering. But what about the vast majority of people who have lived on this planet, up to and including today, who are still in a pre-literate state? None of them seem to feel a need to go around stroking themselves. In fact, the argument has been made that pre-literate people actually experience a wider range of sensory delights because they aren't constantly operating with the filter of the written word between them and their experience.

Which leads to the major misfiring of this movie (a pun!). It doesn't succeed in making its case against book-burning. If anything, it makes the illiterates' world look in some ways more attractive than that of the bookworm. Before Werner's defiant conversion to the wonder of books, we see him and his wife ensconced at home around the TV. His wife has convivial groups of gal-pals over. They exercise in front of the set, laugh about planned purchases, snack. There is human interaction.

In the secret glade where Werner escapes government control though, where he meets up with other rebels - there is almost no human interaction. All these booklovers are preoccupied memorizing the books they have chosen to become and to thereby save from extinction. They walk around in single file all day, becoming their books. This movie makes these escapees look like the ultimate victims of mind control as they parade woodenly past each other, barely acknowledging the existence of their fellow book saviors. I hardly think that was the kind of world Bradbury wanted to project.

Another awkward element is introduced as Julie Christie is called upon to play a dual role. This cloning of her is distracting and confusing. However, she does contribute a really interesting, intelligent commentary for the DVD release of this movie. But I don't think that bonus feature is quite enough to warrant spending too much time with Fahrenheit 451.

So in an effort to stop this, the fire departments now have the duty to seek out and burn literature, not put out fires (since houses are now fireproof).  People cope through the day taking various uppers and downers to control emotions and sleep.  Montauge, a fireman of 6 years and up for promotion, becomes facinated with a gal he meets on the train to work. Along the way his curiosity is sparked and he starts collecting the items he is in charge to destroy, Books. As his mind comes alive and emotions are awakened, he begins to crack at home and work.  The movie was entertaining, again a good adaptation of the book, and had interesting set that seem good for the time period, reminicent of the clockwork orange movie. I enjoyed this movie, and think it is worth picking up if you like this genre of movie/book.",1152748800,3,1313,4.56595744680851
227494,4,6300184250,"From the late sixties, a time when important movies were being made hand over fist. This was the era that produced movies like ""2001"", ""A Thousand Clowns"", ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", ""Last Summer"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Yellow Submarine"", ""Romeo & Juliet"", ""The Producers"" and many others....

""Fahrenheit 451"" was one of the SOCIALLY important films of the era. In fact, I still have a hard time thinking of this as a Francois Truffaut movie! This was not standard Truffaut...Truffaut's films were almost always ""slice of life"" vignettes, like ""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me"" or ""Jules et Jim""...""Fahrenheit"" actually seemed like an effort by Truffaut to produce a Jean Luc Goddard film, since Goddard was pretty much marketed as the ""social conscience"" of the French new wave.

The dead giveaway that it's an ""important"" movie? The presence of Oskar Werner, Julie Christie and Cyril Cusack! Werner's presence in ANY movie of the time was an obvious indication of the director's intent on being ""heard"". I don't think Werner, who died in 1984, was in one completely ""frivolous"" movie in his entire career! This was the man that was in ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", ""Ship Of Fools"", ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"", a biography of Mozart and ""Jules et Jim""....a nice resume if you're going for cinematic street cred. Julie Christie was supposedly Miss ""Important Actress"" of the time....something I've always missed for some reason...she's cute, but has almost ZERO screen charisma and isn't that fantastic an actress, but she, also, was in a slew of ""important"" films, like ""Dr Zhivago"", ""Darling and ""Petulia"", as well as this one. The late Cyril Cusack, also from ""Spy"" with Werner from 1966, had had a long and varied career, both in plays and movies, and despite his veddy British ways, was Irish. Add to this a British cast of supernumeraries, and we have a ready-made, existential-sociological sci-fi movie for the espresso-and-wine set.

The plot involves Werner, playing a character named Guy Montag, working for a dystopic government of the near-future, burning books to keep the populace from ""becoming unhappy with their lot"". Newspapers are even text-free, consisting of nothing but comic strip-style pictures with no dialogue balloons. Cyril Cusack plays his imperious immediate supervisor, whose name is never mentioned. Julie Christie has a duel role, that of Montag's drugged out, bubble-headed, conformist wife....and a perky, non-conformist schoolteacher who is secretly a ""bookperson"", or somebody defying the law of the land that forbids the reading of books. The differentiation is made with very different haircuts for the two women, and it actually works. Montag is due for a promotion in all this after ten years of service as a ""fireman"".

On the way home one day, however, Montag meets the schoolteacher, Clarisse, on his monorail commute, and they strike up a conversation. He's immediately taken with her resemblance to his wife, Linda, and tells her so. She notes his profession, since he has commuted partially in uniform, and asks him: ""Do you ever read the books you burn?"" He says no, but that question sticks in his mind and he eventually does become curious as to what their hold is. After noting how empty his wife has become as a conformer, eventually, his friendship with Clarisse begins to blossom. He starts reading books, and he rather boldly, if not naively, reveals this to his wife.

Eventually, the feckless little so-and-so rats him out and he has to run to his new friend Clarisse and her community of book-memorizers who live on the outskirts of the city this all takes place in, (another thing that is never revealed is the name of the city.) Montag meets people who don't use their real names, but go by the name of the books they have committed to memory. He meets an adorable young woman who states, perkily, that she is ""Jean-Paul Sartre's 'The Jewish Question' Delighted to meet you!"" and right after her comes her boyfriend: ""I'm 'The Martian Chronicles' by Ray Bradbury..."" The story that ""Fahrenheit 451"" is based on was, in fact, written by Ray Bradbury as well...

This film, as old as it is, still plays well in this day and age, and still has about 80% of the impact it did when it was current. The DVD has the usual extras, like Ray Bradbury's own discussion of the writing of the novel the film is based on, a commentary on the making of the film, the original distaff intro to the film and a poster gallery, (mostly focusing on Ms. Christie!)

Nostalgic for one of those neat, semi-obscure films they made when the entire cinematic world was on a roll? I couldn't recommend this standout Truffaut-trying-to-be-Goddard film more...

(And you'll have some idea why I question the wisdom of him being in ""Close Encounters of the Third KInd"", a movie made by a much lesser director, even for the short time he's in it!)",1151193600,5,4893,4.886746987951807
227495,5,6300184250,"Last week I watched Farenheit 451 for the first time on TV, and the film seemed remarkably prophetic. It's hard to believe this movie about a society that forbids all reading and burns all books was made 40 years ago.

We live in a frightening time, and although our firefighters don't set fire to books, we're already beginning to lose our sense of freedom and rationality. A few weeks ago, millions of Muslims took to the streets, burning books and everything in sight to protest against freedom of speech. And here in the U.S., the magazines that reproduced the cartoons have been removed from the shelves of many bookstores.

Visually, the film's modern living room with its huge flat-screen TV seems right on target. The mindless audience participation show that Linda watches each night could easily be a current reality program. And the picture-filled but wordless newspaper Montag ""reads"" looks like a new product for our post-literate age. Just last night, I heard the 911 Commission Report will soon be released in comic book format ""for people who don't read books."" Of course, chills went down my spine.",1145318400,4,1115,4.925531914893617
227496,5,6300184250,"This film first appeared in theaters in 1966. The Vietnam War was just getting under way, and the Pentagon was beefing up its disinformation campaign that was later documented in David Halberstam's book The Best and the Brightest. The film was based on a novel by Ray Bradbury, first published in 1953, when the hysterical Red Scares of McCarthyism were near their peak.

Bradbury's writing was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview on the DVD, Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction.

That the ""New Wave"" director, Francois Truffaut agreed to direct the film was unusual. Bradbury was already an established writer, who probably wanted some artistic control and Truffaut was promoting the auteur theory of film in which the director has absolute artistic control.

The friction had a couple of effects on the film. Truffaut, eager to begin filming wrote the screenplay before fully mastering English. Even Truffaut was disappointed in the end with the stiff, flat dialog. For Truffaut, Fahrenheit 451 was his first, and last, English-language film. This may have contributed to the flatness of the characters. Some reviewers made an asset out of the stiffness by saying that the characters, deprived of serious thinking, and of books, and addled by drugs, were themselves, in fact, flat, soulless creatures. Bradbury had little say on the final screenplay.

The central character, Guy Montag, (Oskar Werner) is a ""fireman."" In this disturbing vision of the future, firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have ""conflicting ideas"" in them. Those ideas can make people feel bad. It is the government's job to keep people happy, with drugs, large-screen television, and other entertainment. Does anyone still remember the term ""Happy Talk News? Let's keep it positive.

The novel played on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought, mainly through intimidation, was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists, who supported McCarthy. The book burnings by Nazis, which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II, were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.

By the time the film appeared, America was more concerned with race riots. So, burning was a viscerally powerful theme. Lost on most viewers in 1966 was the detail that among the burned books was the film journal Cahiers du Cinema for which Truffaut wrote, and that on the magazine's cover was a picture from the film Breathless, written by Truffaut. Also among the burned books: The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451, both written by Bradbury.

Truffaut, however, contributed much to the uniqueness of the film as a work of art separate from the book. From the opening credits, which were spoken and not displayed on the screen, to the ending, in which the exiles who have devoted their lives to memorizing books recite their books while walking blissfully in the snow, Truffaut's genius is there. Also a stroke of genius was the casting of Julie Christie as Monag's drug-addled wife, and as the more compassionate and interested Clarisse, who seduces him into reading and thinking.

Like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, describes a hedonist world, where the people need not think. I'll have my Valium now. And I have cable, so there must be something to watch. Maybe a rerun of Jerry Springer.",1140220800,13,3686,5.08099173553719
227497,5,6300184250,"It's curious that a director who spent so much of his early career railing against the tyranny of the literary tradition in French cinema should spend so much of his career either adapting novels or filling his films with techniques from and references to literature at every turn, so his attraction to Ray Bradbury's fable isn't that surprising. What is surprising is that in many ways it's his most purely cinematic film, discarding his usual over-reliance on voice-over to carry underwritten scenes for more purely cinematic forms of interpretation. Even the readings from the forbidden books are kept to a minimum: the obsession is in Montag's behavior, not the words he speaks.

Truffaut's playfulness is all over the material, from casting an actor who forbade his children to watch TV or go to the cinema as the fire chief (Cyril Cusack in the film's standout performance) to dramatically masking off half the screen and heightening the dramatic music for what turns out to be a less than dramatic moment in a search - and that's without the inclusion of Cahiers du Cinema among the burning books or mentioning Anton Diffring's brief moment in drag. But then this is an absurdist world, where firemen slide up poles and start fires and where fascism is accepted in that way it always is when gradually introduced because of people's innate ability to adapt to their circumstances, no matter how absurd or restricting.

It improves on Bradbury's novel by losing some of the more distancing sci-fi devices such as the fortune telling dog, and setting it's future in a soulless post-war New Town environment that is close enough to the real look of the time to add to the credibility. Much of what there is in the film isn't that far from reality, with plasma wall screens offering inept interactive' TV (even down to pressing the red button) becoming status symbols, and betrayal increasingly encouraged as an everyday, socially acceptable act. Indeed, the world it presents, where people touch themselves, not each other, and where conflicting ideas are discouraged because they just make people unhappy, seems all too contemporary. Only what is possibly the single worst special effect in film history (those laughable flying policeman on all-too visible wires), the film's one ill-judged excursion into optical effects, sticks out like a sore thumb.

Despite the huge problems between Oskar Werner (who wanted to play Montag with a wink and a smile) and Truffaut (who ended the shoot directing through an intermediary, using body doubles and having to cut Werner's takes shortly before he smiled!), Montag seems a credible protagonist, an empty vessel who suddenly has his horizons violently opened. Even the accent seems strangely right: not so much the idea of a German playing a fascist book burner (indeed, Diffring's German accent is dubbed here), but the way it seems to compliment the formal language of the piece. Even Julie Christie's blandness and sporadic awkward enthusiasm work well enough in this environment for her almost to seem to give a perform for once.

Throw in Bernard Herrmann's remarkably beautiful, sparingly used score, never more effective than in the final sequences that are almost magically complimented by the happy accident of a totally unexpected snowfall, and the result is a surprisingly moving piece about fundamentally shallow people. And it is a very comforting thought that, if behind every book is a man (or woman), then somewhere there is a man or woman who will keep every book alive despite all efforts to destroy it.

Universal's DVD is one of the very best on the market: the audio commentary is occassionally unsatisfying, but any gaps are more than filled in by the excellent 45-minute documentary, interview with Ray Bradbury, featurette on Herrmann's score, alternate title sequence, stills and poster gallery and trailer. Highly recommended.",1136505600,15,3900,5.106583072100314
227498,5,6300184250,"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic film about a society that is forbidden to read books.  The government controls all that the people hear or see.  Montag (Oskar Werner) is a fireman.  In this time, firemen do not put out fires.  They burn the contraband books.

On the way home he meets Claris (Julie Christie).  Claris is a free spirit.  She questions everything.  One way you can tell this is by her home.  It is a free standing Victorian home.

Montag's home is part of a block of identical attached homes.  He is married to Linda (Julie Christie in a dual role).  She is the model of the perfect wife whose emotions are regulated by pills.

Claris makes Montag start to question his job and he sneaks a book home (David Copperfield).  After reading it he is hooked and starts to bring more books home.  This makes him more dissatisfied with the status quo.  He becomes bolder and bolder until he disrupts Linda's party with reading a book to the ladies.

Claris' home is raided but she escapes.  Montag finds Claris and she tells him that she is going to live with the book people.  Linda denounces Montag and he is forced to burn his own collection.  Montag uses the fire to escape.

This was famed French director Francois Truffaut's only English language film and his first color film.  This is the only film not to have any printed credits, they are spoken. (Apocalypse Now in its roadshow release had no screen credits except the title but the credits printed and handed out.)

The novel comes from a time when many people felt that we being dehumanized. Other famous books in this vain are Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty Four.  The interesting thing is Truffaut's imagery of the people becoming self involved and finding their only satisfaction from self gratification.

This film adaptation is excellent.  Although it set in the future, Tony Walton's production design infuses futuristic and retro looks brilliantly.  And future new wave director Nicholas Roeg creates a surreal look with his cinematography.  Finally, Bernard Herrman's score is very evocative of the repressed mood of the society.

227499,4,6300184250,"Although this film did not have the same serious tone of the novel, it still worked on many levels. For one, the film's depiction of a futuristic society, in which all individuality seems to be lost and societal change is frowned upon, seems to illustrate the relevance of a need for change.

 The movie works as a satirical parable on censorship, yet with the same qualities as Orwell's 1984. The whole idea that books and literature are obsolete nonsense, and that firemen are only there to start fires with these books (rather than putting them out), demonstrates the backwardness of this society. Much like Winston in Orwell's novel, Montag seems to emerge from his stupor in life-in job, family and ideals-to question the way society is run. Winston's secret journal entries are parallel with Montag's need to secretly read and gain information. Just like Winston tries to defy Big Brother, Montag tries to defy the Book Police.

Montag, who works as a fireman, only begins to change after meeting Clarisse, a 17 year old girl who questions Montag about his job of burning books. She lives next door to him, and does not understand how he can continually do a job without questioning the ethics of it. Montag's transformation comes not only in the form of reading, but his home life as well. His wife, Linda, has an obsession with watching television and has no ability to communicate with him on a deeper level. At one point, after she confronts him after catching him reading a book and tells him she wants the book out of her house, he says ""You spent your whole life in front of the family on the wall. The books are MY family.""

As Montag drifts further away from the role of fireman, it gets harder and harder for him to burn the books and perform his job. His boss begins to notice a change, and eventually tries to force Montag to burn his own books. He and his boss are opposites however: at one point his boss discovers a secret library and, after telling him that all the books there are rubbish, states emphatically ""The only way to be happy is for everyone to be equal."" By this time, Montag has discovered that people need to be individuals and seek knowledge to feel meaningful.

The film does not try to take itself too seriously however, and it really is a satire in many instances. The books that are commonly called trash in the film are by some of the most heralded authors in history: Dickens, Cervantes, Aristotle, etc. At one point, during a book search, Montag's boss spots a baby with a book in his stroller, and takes it away from him and wags his finger at the young baby, as if the infant had a choice in reading.

More neat aspects of the DVD are the extras, particularly the commentary with Ray Bradbury. In this commentary, Bradbury gives a little bit of background about himself, such as how he got started writing and where he grew up, and then launches into ideas behind the story Fahrenheit 451.  From watching this part, it certainly appears as though Bradbury was in full support of this movie, even if his story was altered a little.

Overall, this is a great DVD to check out!",1133913600,3,3120,4.578853046594982
227500,4,6300184250,"Oskar Werner and Julie Christie star in this fine adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel about a society where books are burned and all information is gained through the use of wall-mounted tvs.  Werner stars as Guy Montag, a firefighter.  However, his job is not to put out fires, but to gather up books and burn them.  Christie plays a dual role in the movie.  Her first character is Linda, Montag's ditsy wife who spends her days popping pills and watching propaganda on her television.  Christie's second role is that of Clairese, a revolutionary schoolteacher who defies the powers that be and continues to read.

As the movie goes along, Montag and Clairese develop an alliance; Montag has started hoarding books instead of burning them, while Clairese describes a place where fellow readers have set up their own society, memorized complete books, and taken the names of the books for themselves.  Meanwhile, Julie has turned Montag in to his own firefighters, who raid Montag's house, confiscate his books (save for one) and force Montag to burn the rest himself.

However, he turns on the firefighters and escapes to the society of book readers, who in turn have faked Montag's shooting by the authorities.  He and Clairese are now free to live together amongst the other book lovers.

I found the movie's theme to be especially interesting.  Being a Master's degree student in library science, I was especially intrigued by the degree of censorship in the movie, and what could become of society if indeed there were no books to be had.  I thought Julie Christie did an excellent job in her dual roles as Linda and Clairese, while Oskar Werner was very good as well. On a lighter note, I liked the person who took the name ""Martian Chronicles"" , another of Bradbury's novels, in the society.  I recommend this fine movie.

Sadly, the film adaptation conveys little of the original book's sense of urgency and seriousness.  Between weak directing and uninspired acting, the final product is rather flat and unemotional, and there is very little one could honestly call ""memoreable""--particularly if you have read the book.  Worst of all, significant parts of the book (which is not that long to begin with) are cut out, making the story even more shallow, and the significantly altered ending is horrendous.  The image of people milling around the woods reciting literature is one of a 60's experimental art film, rather than the realistic vision of dystopia Bradbury originally created.",1130112000,,894,5.319148936170213

I reminds us that without creativity and imagination we have nothing.  If only everyone could experience the adventures of great literature.

This movie, based on the 1953 novel of the same title by Ray Bradbury (born 1920), is set in a world where reading is forbidden, books and any printed material are burned and, as well, critical thought is discouraged.  The movie's title refers to the ignition temperature of paper.  (The ignition temperature is the temperature at which something catches fire and burns on its own.)  For paper, as the movie's protagonist Montag (Oskar Werner) tells us, is 451 degrees Fahrenheit (or 233 degrees Celsius).

Montag works at fire station #451.  The motto of the station is ""We burn [books] to ashes and then burn the ashes.""  He tells us his routine as a ""fireman:""

""On Monday we burn [books by] Miller, Tuesday Tolstoy, Wednesday Walt Whitman, Friday Faulkner, and Saturday & Sunday Schopenhauer and Sartre.""

Julie Christie is in a dual role as Montag's pleasure-seeking conformist wife, Linda (Christie with long hair), and his rebellious, book-collecting schoolteacher friend Clarisse (Christie with short hair).  Some people, especially those not familiar with the novel, might fine this duality confusing.

It's when the regimented, obedient Montag meets this revolutionary schoolteacher who dares to break the law and read that Montag's problems begin.  He eventually begins collecting books by stealing them and reads them instead of burning them.  Suddenly, he finds himself a hunted fugitive, forced to choose not only between two women but between personal safety and intellectual freedom.

Cyril Cusack as the fire station captain also gives a fine performance.  He has no regrets in burning books.  His reasoning:

""We've all got to be alike.  The only way to be happy is for everyone to be made equal.""

The very beginning of this movie is interesting.  Instead of having the credits printed on the screen, they are read in keeping with the idea of no printed material.

The movie itself seems at first to be slow-paced and listless.  This is the point.  The people as a consequence of not reading are dull and empty.

There's only one scene that has special effects that seems out of place by today's standards.  But this movie was made almost forty years ago (from the year of this review) when special effects technology was still in its infancy so this can't be held against the movie.

I thought the ending was very interesting.  It offers hope for a better future.

The background music is exceptional.  It adds to each scene.

This is what the author of the novel, Ray Bradbury, said about this movie (taken from ""A Conversation with Ray Bradbury"" found in ""Fahrenheit 451: The 50TH Anniversary Edition""):

""The movie [directed by Francois Truffaut] was a mixed blessing.  It didn't follow the novel as completely as it should have.  It's a good movie; it has a wonderful ending; it has a great [musical background] score by Bernard Hermann;  Oskar Werner [as Montag] is wonderful in the lead.  But Truffaut made the mistake of putting Julie Christie in two roles [as Montag's long-haired wife and his short-haired friend] in the same [movie], which was very confusing [to some people], and he eliminated some of the other characters...Faber the philosopher [a central character to the novel] and the Mechanical Hound [that hunts down people who break the law by reading].  I mean you can't do without those!""

Bradbury continues:

""They're going to make a new version [of my novel] sometime in the next year [2004].  Mel Gibson will produce it, and Frank Darabont will direct it: he did 'The Shawshank Redemption'...I'm looking forward to [seeing this new version].""

I still felt that this movie was quite good despite the missing elements Bradbury mentions.

Finally, the DVD has good picture and sound quality.  There are six extras, all interesting.

In conclusion, this is a thought-provoking movie based on a science fiction masterpiece.  After viewing it, I could understand why it made the top 100 science fiction movies of all time!!

227516,2,6300184250,"Okay, I saw this movie at home on DVD. I've read the book before and have to say that I did not enjoy it. It was a quick read, but a little too slow and preachy. I was expecting a much more interesting movie, but it was just as slow, if not slower, as the book. Maybe it's because I knew what was going to happen, but I just could not stay awake for the whole thing.

I think the book made Clarisse seem much younger and charming, but in the film, she's a little annoying. The relationship between her and Montag seems to just start out of nowhere and it doesn't really seem plausible. I found it hard to find any likable characters in the movie, and it was just too slow for my liking.

Yeah, there were some thought provoking and innovative scenes such as what happens to people after they have their stomaches cleaned out and the scene with the boy in the school running away from Clarisse was eery and fit the tone of the movie well. But overall, I found it hard to enjoy or even finish. Too slow and tedious.",1120780800,2,1013,4.163265306122449
227517,3,6300184250,"Let's get one thing straight: 451 degrees Fahrenheit is NOT the temperature at which paper burns, as Ray Bradbury readily admits - he just loved the look and sound of that title.

Perhaps taking such looseness as his inspiration, Truffaut's free-wheeling adaptation of Bradbury's classic novel is intriguing, but doesn't quite work. By conflating the Clarisse and Faber characters, it halves the exposition but it also halves the story's power. For me, Faber is the novel's central character, and without his insightful defense of literature and freedom we only get one side of the argument. No one explains why books are important, why they matter. So given that Montag only becomes violent after he starts reading, Truffaut's version comes dangerously close to supporting Captain Beatty's argument that an ignorant society is a safe one. It becomes less a story about censorship and ""the forgetting of history"" as a means of social control, and more about the repressed emotions that reading might unlock. While this does pick up on one of Bradbury's minor recurring themes (the importance of ""the natural"") it isn't ""Fahrenheit 451"". Moreover, the relentlessly miserable look of this film misses Bradbury's point. His dystopian future isn't grim on the surface: it's a hyper-real America of neat green lawns and porch-less houses, a facade of state-sanctioned happiness masking the horror within. Truffaut's just looks like East Germany.

Of course, adaptations don't have to be literal. The best ones are never a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved. But Truffaut's film fails on that count. At the very least, an adaptation should be faithful to the spirit of its source, but Truffaut's fails there, too. He doesn't do the novel justice, nor give us anything better. It's even more disappointing because it lacks the style and skill which distinguish so many of Truffaut's other films (and I love many of them). So I'm left wondering why he bothered. If you don't respect the source material as anything more than a vague inspiration, why adapt it? Why not just write your own story about book burning and call it something else?

Adapting this novel isn't difficult. I wrote an adaptation of it as a college screenwriting assignment and found that if you stick with the book's characters and structure, it pretty much falls into place. Bradbury himself has said: ""My books are movies already. Just take out the pages and stuff them in the camera."" While that isn't quite true (there are huge slabs of melodramatic dialogue to be culled, and plenty of anachronisms to weed out), there is a lot to be said for faithful adaptations of his work, especially this one: there are few writers in sci-fi, or in any genre, who combine Bradbury's native talent for visual storytelling with such an intelligent and abiding interest in big themes.

""Fahrenheit 451"" is crying out for a remake. The case it puts is resurgently relevant, and our digital technology makes screening its disturbing and beautiful images entirely possible, even easy. Frank Darabont is slated to write and direct a new version for Castle Rock sometime soon. The project has been delayed so many times now, I'm starting to get the impression he's waiting for Bradbury to die so he can butcher it with impunity. But Darabont has a good eye and a strong sense of story. If he can just resist his irritating tendency to ""go Capra"" and turn this into some kind of sappy, futuristic Norman Rockwell painting, I'm confident he'll pull it off. With its memorable characters, compelling plot and powerful themes, it has Oscar written all over it. I can see it now... Keanu Reeves or Colin Farrell as Montag (both of whom can portray strength and the requisite sensitivity), Anthony Hopkins as Faber, Robert De Niro as Captain Beatty (although I guarantee Darabont will cast James Whitmore and Jeffrey DeMunn respectively), music by John Williams (with a nod to Carl Orff), and cinematography by Dante Spinotti or Darius Khondji.... Oh, in the right hands, it's a cross-category winner just waiting to be born.",1116460800,4,4246,5.009915014164306
227518,4,6300184250,"Fahrenheit 451 is a strange film, hard to describe.  No other director could or would have interpreted the classic Bradbury novel in the same bizarre, fascinating manner as Francois Truffaut. It's a book, and a film, about freedom, choices, individuality, and intellectual repression in a future where books are forbidden; where Firemen are men who start fires...fires in which they burn books.

It was also the first color film directed by Truffaut. Although he by all accounts was not happy about making a color film and found it a bit unsettling, color is used to great effect here; sparingly, except for the extreme shade of red that is seen throughout.

""Fahrenheit 451"" is supposed to be the temperature at which book paper catches fire, as the protagonist Guy Montag (Oskar Werner) explains in a scene at the beginning.  Guy is a Fireman who seems happy enough with his life until he is approached by a young woman named Clarisse (Julie Christie) on his way home from work one day.  She starts up a conversation with him, and the two become friendly.  She bewilders him but challenges him to think and feel....and read.  And when he arrives home we see his wife (also played by Julie Christie, with long hair), sedated and watching the wallscreen (TV of sorts)...we see what his life is really like, although he had told Clarisse he was ""happy""...he is not.

As his friendship with Clarisse grows, he starts to secretly take home, hoard, and read some of the books he finds in the course of his daily work, and as he reads, he becomes obsessed with the books.  They become his mistress, and are what finally make him feel affection and warmth.  And when he starts to feel and care, so do we.

The two single best scenes are a passionate one involving an old woman who refuses to leave her books, her ""children"" as she calls them; and the wonderful ending of the film. The countless, painful closeups of books as they are being burned are beautifully done, and difficult to watch.

Truffaut was a well-known disciple of Alfred Hitchcock's films, so when Hitchcock fired his long-time music collaborator Bernard Herrmann during the filming of ""Torn Curtain"", Truffaut was thrilled to acquire his talents for his own film.  The score for ""F451"" is beautiful, and the film would not be nearly as effective without it.

Writer/producer/director Frank Darabont (""The Green Mile"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"") is working on a new film of ""Fahrenheit 451"" this year.  He says it won't be a remake of the original film.",1115942400,4,2516,4.805104408352668
227519,5,6300184250,"This was such a great movie.  Generally, I'm not a huge fan of older films, but this film oozed 60's cool with the elevated train (I loved the way passengers exited it!), funky interior decorations, music and clothing styles.

  But that is only part of it.  I really enjoyed the performance of Oskar Werner, I had never seen his work before.  He brought a strong sense of bewilderment to his role.  He effectively conveyed the sense that he knows there is something wrong with society, but is unsure about how to deal with it, having followed and upheld the rules all his life, and especially since everyone around him is so oblivious, namely his wife.

  My only problem was the ending.  I felt the book people were a little strange.  I really don't see how the little society they built up was some kind of utopia.  It seemed more like a mental institution to me. If I had to choose between living with the book people and living with no books but lots of TV, I would probably choose the latter.  I haven't read the book though, does anyone know if the book people are in the book, or is that the creation of Truffaut?

  Anyway, please see this film! You will love it.  Especially if you are the literary type.",1109116800,4,1214,4.416289592760181
227520,4,6300184250,"For a Truffaut film, this one is very odd. (1)The film is based on the science fiction short story by Ray Bradbury. Truffaut had made a career out of character studies clearly in the present tense. (2)The film is in color, a medium in which the director had never worked, nor had he the desire to move in this direction. (3)The film is filled with Hitchcockisms and Truffaut even employed Bernard Herrman (Hitchcock's music man) to write the soundtrack. (4)The film is in English. Truffaut did not speak the language! Despite being completely out of his element, the film is very effective, not so much as a science fiction story, but as a homage to the written word and as a warning of what can happen when a government, under the guise of protecting a social structure, curtails freedom of expression. Almost an anti-communist manifesto. The opening sequence is brilliant, with the credits being spoken against a backdrop of antennae, rather than allowing words onto the screen. Indeed, later in the film, some of the most dramatic images are close-ups of the insides of books: words. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper burns, and in the future, it is the job of firemen to burn any and every book that exists. Books empower the individual to think freely, and this is counter the objective of a society that wants to create a culture of sameness and conformity. Montag is a fire leader and is married to a pill popping conformist wife but finds himself drawn to rebellious book reading ex teacher. Both of these characters are played by Julie Christie, and this stoke of genius ads a whole new dimension to the story in general and Montag's character in particular. One day he decides to read one of these forbidden books, the novel ""David Copperfield"" by Charles Dickens, and his brain becomes unshackled but with this freedom comes discontent. His becomes acutely aware that he is ""not living, just killing time."" Soon he will find himself outside of the system he worked to uphold.",1106784000,5,2006,4.783861671469741

Fahrenheit 451 follows Montag (formerly Guy Montag in

language and then lights his translation dictionary
on fire.

By far the most entertaining facet of the film
is Oskar Werner's accent presented in its original
monotone.

Even this, of course, grew tedious when Montag decided
to read me the first chapter of David Copperfield.

The film includes several 10-minute book burning montages
that kept me asking myself, ""is there something more that
I'm not getting.""

There wasn't.

Unfortunately most of the science fiction elements
(e.g. the firehouse's mechanical spider/dog with a
syringe leg) were precluded by it being 1966.

This caused many of the most physically suspenseful
portions of the book to be absent from the film.

Although a few attempts were made, such as the flying
men on wires which came close to fooling me when I was 8.

227522,4,6300184250,"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper will burn. It is the basis for the premise of this film, which is based upon the Ray Bradbury's classic sci-fi novel of the same name. The film takes the viewer to a stark future in which firemen start fires rather than put them out. Their main mission appears to be to root out books, wherever they may be found, and burn them. Those who harbor books in their home are breaking the law and are subject to arrest by the state. The written word is simply forbidden.

Oskar Werner plays the role of Guy Montag, a fireman who is married to a beautiful air-head named Linda, who spends her days popping pills, while glued to a wall screen TV. Played with appropriate bubble-brained inertia by the talented Julie Christie, this is just one of the dual roles she plays in this film. The other role is that of Clarisse, a would be school teacher and seeming misfit in that society, as she actually likes to talk about ideas, the very reason that books are forbidden. It seems that books are looked upon as giving people ideas, which is viewed by the state as a mechanism for making people unhappy with their lot.

When Clarisse singles out Montag for conversation, he is intrigued by the fact that she is capable of independent thought. It is not long before he, too, like those whose books he has burned, is also, to his wife's dismay,  hoarding books. She feels that Montag is simply sucking the fun out of her life. Clarisse and Montag form an alliance of sorts, as his world comes tumbling down. Betrayed by his conformist wife Linda, Montag joins the ranks of fugitive book lovers, hunted by the very firemen with whom he served. These fugitives are not known by their names, but rather, by the title of the book to which they have committed to memory, in hopes that one day the world will once again be ready to accept that which they have committed to memory.

The film has a stark, futuristic quality about it. Symbolism is rampant throughout the film. The homes of those who hoard books are often homes that are cozy and reminiscent of homes of our book loving society today, while those of people  who are with the program are stark and cold. The all black uniforms worn by the firemen are reminiscent of those worn by the storm troopers of Nazi Germany. The actions of the firemen, as they search for those who would hoard books, as well as the search for the books themselves,  are also reminiscent of the search by the Nazis for those who would harbor those who were deemed undesirable under the Nazi regime, as well as the search for undesirables themselves. Oskar Werner's German accent underscores this imagery.

This is Francois Truffaut's first and only foray into the direction of an English language film. He himself was co-writer of the screenplay, which is perhaps why the imagery seems to supercedes the dialogue. There are many stylistic flourishes throughout the film. Ray Bradbury's, ""The Martian Chronicles"", is one of the books seen to be burning. It is also one of the books that a fugitive has committed to memory.  Newspapers in the film  consist of pictures only. Even the opening credits of the film are in keeping with the premise of the film that the written word is forbidden. As such, the opening credits are spoken.  Moreover, Bernard Herrmann's edgy score certainly adds to the bleak, futuristic feel of the film. This is a film that  those who enjoyed the novel upon which the film is based should see.",1105833600,81,3489,4.611290322580645
227543,4,6300184250,"Ray Bradbury's 1953 science fiction classic is brought to the screen here by French New Wave director Francois Truffaut.  There are a number of memorable elements in the story, that does justice to Bradbury's vision of a dystopic future-world.  Among the sleek modern architecture and monorails of its city, its denizens' main pursuit is watching TV (the book even suggests 3- and 4-wall television ""rooms"").  Happiness is emphasized, and books are excoriated as giving people confusing or melancholy ideas.  Oskar Werner portrays Montag, a well-off fireman, employed here for the purpose of burning books, which alight at the title temperature.  Julie Christie--in just part of a fascinating dual performance--portrays his pretty but vacuous wife, Linda.  Montag becomes interested in an enigmatic neighbor, Clarisse (also played by Christie), an elementary school teacher who likes talking with her family and discussing ideas.

I like the environment suggested by the film, although the somewhat stark 1960's modernism may seem a bit dated to some.  In a zeitgeist sense, our visions of tomorrow have gone sort of ""back to the future"" styles of the 1930's Art Moderne with industrial structural suggestions, like at Disneyworld's Tommorrowland or in the recent film ""Sky Captain and the World of Tommorrow.""  However the mod hair styles and clothing fashion are perfectly suited to this subject, and are well modelled on the versatile Julie Christie.  Montag's basic black also suits the simple citizen just starting to learn about literate ideas.

The most haunting idea of the film is presented near the end, where Montag meets the group of scholars, renegades who have have banded in the woods, memorizing books to save them for a time when their wisdom might one day be valued again.  The closing scene with all the people walking about reciting their books must be one of film's greatest ""what-if's?""  It brings to mind the Wim Wenders film ""Wings of Desire"", where the angels quietly listen to the thoughts of readers in a Berlin library.",1096675200,7,2047,5.185410334346504

It's impossible not to think of the Heinrich Heine quote, ""Where one burns books; one will soon burn people"" while watching it.  The inversion of a fire fighters who, rather than put out fires, start them was a very innovative idea on Bradbury's part.  The main character is quite compelling and easily evokes our sympathy.  This work is prescient and timeless.  In today's talk show era, do books still not remain dangerous and subversive?",1090108800,6,589,4.715686274509804

227547,5,6300184250,"This film has failed to attract the attention and appreciation which I think it deserves. Directed by Francois Truffaut and based on Ray Bradbury's novel, it co-stars Oskar Werner (Guy Montag) and Julie Christie in two roles (Linda and Clarisse). The cinematography provided by Nicolas Roeg is superb. The title specifies the temperature at which paper will burn in a totalitarian society in which books are systematically incinerated by ""firemen"" whose single purpose is to eliminate anything which encourages and nourishes freedom of thought. Montag is one of them, a Fire Captain. Over time, his loyalties become divided between a love of literature and an obligation to destroy it. Hence the dual role for Christie: Clarisse McClelland is a neighbor and book lover to whom Montag is attracted (in several different ways) whereas Linda is committed to feeding the bonfires with as many books as can be located.
Why do books pose such a serious threat? In the novel, Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way. ""Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy."" In other words, entertain people with mindless television programming, thereby to isolate them from any ideas which could raise doubts about the oppressive system. The quality of acting is consistently outstanding throughout the cast. The film is generally faithful to Bradbury's novel, taking certain liberties here and there but preserving the atmospherics of menace, fear, and (worst of all) submission. The heroes and heroines are those who meet in secret, sharing passages which they have memorized from great books.  So long as that process continues, ""dangerous ideas"" will be kept alive.",1080950400,2,1802,5.235294117647059
227548,4,6300184250,"It was a strange movie; the edgy feeling was on par with, say, Edward scissor-hands. That was mostly due to the Score being very well done. A beef I have with a lot of more modern movies is that people don't use their score and background music well anymore. With the exception of Lord of the Rings, the use of themes takes the place of mood- and that's not really a good thing. In Fahrenheit, the music sets the tone and helps you interpret the intended emotional effect. Otherwise, in a movie with so little dialogue and such stone-faced acting (which wasn't as negative as it sounds), you'd hardly know what you were supposed to feel!
The story is set in the near future, in a time when books have been outlawed. The main character is a fireman- no, he doesn't put out fires (homes these days are modern and fire-proof - he starts them by burning books. Firemen are trained to go out on calls to people's homes, raid them of all their hidden books and burn them. Television totally controls the culture standard as all people are brought into uniformity with each other. The communist idea of everyone being made alike is brought to its full manifestation.
The Fireman begins to read the books he burns after meeting a lady who doesn't quite fit the mold.  Eventually he is caught, murders his captain with a flame thrower and escapes to live with the Book People, a commune of individuals each of whom have memorized some great work of literature in order to preserve it. ""I'm `The Prince' by Machiavelli"" says one scraggly looking man, ""It should now be plain that you can't judge a book by its cover!""
Seeing as it is an older movie, everything about it is tame as far as how nasty stuff is portrayed. People smoke (books about lung cancer used to make them upset, so they were burned to preserve their happiness), overdose of pills, die fiery deaths among piles of forbidden books, and get shot. But none of it is anywhere near the more brutal or sickening kinds of violence and such one is used to seeing in movies. Incidentally, the one love scene in this movie consists of the wife knocking her husband onto the bed, untying his bathrobe to reveal *gasp* long sleeve and long legged pajamas, and as she wraps her arm around his PJs and kisses him, the scene fades.
As a philosophical movie, it does well, bringing up some excellent questions about ""common good"", ""individuality"", and ""happiness"". As pure entertainment, or party fare, it does very little good at all. Rent it and think through the questions the ""model society"" brings.",1080691200,3,2545,4.605726872246696

This little film, that couldn't keep up with its big brother book, still packs quite a wallop. The ""future"" presented in this flick definitely seems like the past in 2004. Still, the message of anti-intellectualism is as rich and poignant today as anytime. Even by digital 2004 standards ""F451"" remains a memorable landmark about a time in world history when people worried about things as mundane as book burning, government intrustion in personal lives, and seeking life experience greater and more meaningful than looking nice, having a good figure and an empty head.",1078963200,3,702,4.9576271186440675

Fahrenheit 451 takes place in the not-too-distant future where books are completely forbidden. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is about choice. Each choice made by the characters could destroy society.
We first see a man who hears sirens. And during the sirens, the phone rings and a woman's voice tells him to get out of his apartment and to run far, far away. He does and when we explore his apartment we discover the cause of this man's trouble: books. Everywhere there is a hiding place, there is a book. A team of ""firemen"" (note: they aren't called ""fire fighters"" becuase in the future, fires are started by them and the idea of fighting a fire is absurd.) take all the books to the parking lot and burn them. Their badges say ""Fahrenheit 451"" becuase that is the tempature used to burn books. We focus on a man: Montag. He and his wife live ""happily"" in their home next to his ""friend"" Clarisse (both women are played by Julie Christie). One day, Clarisse asks him if he had ever read the books he's burned. Simply put: no. But that strikes an interest in him. He takes a book: David Copperfield and starts to read it. His wife and friends worry and one of them begins to cry after he reads a passage. Her reason: she doesn't like those feelings anymore. It appears that books offend and dehumanize rather than bring goodness and brilliance into the world. In order to make everyone happy they burn books so no one feels sad and people don't become shut-ins because what they read is so facinating. When Montag's secret comes out, he becomes a fugitive and must make a decision: give up books or his life.
Fahrenheit 451 is a classic that everyone should read (ironically, it was a novel) and see. (If you didn't see this version, don't worry: a remake is due in 2004/2005) The idea that no one could read the printed word is surprisingly realistic in the sense that readers are treated as common outlaws. The film makes sense and uses the fact that no one can read to it's advantage: the opening credits are read aloud instead of written out. Cartoons have no captions and life has no meaning.

227583,4,6300184250,"The movie ""Fahrenheit 451"" has always been regarded as a strange, stiff movie, curious not only in the casting, but also in the stilted feelings of the main character and abrupt changes in pacing.  I think that is part of its appeal.
 Ever since it's release in the mid 1960's the film has had a special appeal to the 10 year old in me.  From the afternoon movie appearances on WXYZ TV 7 4:30 pm Movie (edited for time, commercial content, and any suggestion of sexual content) to the occassional late night replay, it's a facinating look at a future society of rules, regulation, control and totalitarianism run rampant.
True, it is difficult to understand Oscar(Montag)Werner's speech at times, and you wonder how he ever linked up with Linda/Julie Christie in the first place... but I think that only helps to underscore his growing sense of not-fitting it, not belonging, alienation, and loneliness. His dying love for her is evident in his frantic attempts to save her, but even in that effort, while the technicians work to casually revive her in the next room, he can only listen in... not actually DO anything to help save the woman he married... as she is restored to a participating member of 'the family'.
There are many images that stay with me, some 35 years since I first saw the film.  I frequently remember the run for darkness in front of the apartment complex/condos... and the errie predictive precursor to ""America's Most Wanted"" program.... ""Let every citizen stand at his front door and watch for...Guy Montag...""
In this modern day of MTV, the obsession with mindless reality shows like ""Dog Eat Dog"", ""Fear Factor"" and ""The Real World""... we have to wonder how close we have grown to this futuristic world of mind-numbing cable television.  As the 80s rock band ""The Tubes"" said, ""What do you want from Life?  To get cable TV and watch it every night?""
This movie, as awkward as it is and always has been, should be required viewing for every high school literature class... in the hopes that some of the brighter students will recognise their classmates and the dangers of becoming one of the ""family"".
By the way, did you hear that the new plazma wide screen TV's are  coming down in price? If you rush now, you can buy a second one for Christmas and install it in your family room... then you'll only need two more before you are completely immersed in cable TV 24/7.....
Think about it.

227586,2,6300184250,"I teach 10th grade English on Long Island, New York and have been teaching Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" for the past 15 years.  As someone who knows the book intimately, I have to say that Francois Truffaut's version of the movie just barely captures Bradbury's intent in writing the novel.  The movie itself is a masterpiece of Truffaut's style of filmmaking.  Bernard Herrmann's score is one of his best.  But, the film lacks the drive of the book.  Oskar Werner's German accent and stiff acting detracts from the movie.  Quite often my students would ask me, ""what did he say""?
One of the most glaring omissions from the book is the absence of the Mechanical Hound.  The Mechanical Hound had a significant role in the book and I believe was left out because of the special effects requirements that were probably cost prohibitive back in 1966.  Another omission is the leaving out of the character Professor Faber.
Other things...  no ""green bullet"" in the ears, no boulevard of high speed drivers and Montag running across ten lanes of the boulevard while ""teenagers"" try to run him down, why change Montag's wife's name from Mildred (in the novel) to Linda (in the movie)?, and finally, why have Clarise reappear at the end of the movie when in the novel she ""disappears""?
All these questions and omissions change the story.  While the skeleton of the novel is there, purists will want to wait for the supposed on again, off again, remake that Mel Gibson was supposedly going to make.
To watch this movie is an experience in Truffaut's filmmaking and you won't be disappointed.  For fans of the novel, however, this movie will let you down.
Watch those wires holding up the flying police!!!  Or were they supposed to be antenna's???  And what's with the other fireman, FabIAN and his looks to the camera all the time??

If you are interested in drama, metaphors and symbolism - this film is replete - but if your interest is science fiction - you may be disappointed. This is a very good film - very subtle - considering its content. Give it some patience and time - there is much more depth then its initial viewing might suggest. I was initially disappointed -  for the acting by the main character seems bland, the sets seem trite and there is lack of grandeur and dynamic range for a science fiction film - but the film really shines in its understated drama and symbolism especially when dealing with choice, government control, government intrusion, freedom, relationships, censorship and the forbidden fruit of knowledge.  The music by Bernard Hermann is excellent - For the price and with a number of very good extras - the DVD is a steal. Normally Truffaut's film work is not for my taste for I feel it often lacks dynamics or contrasts in moods and energy - but I appreciate this work more from seeing the film numerous times. The DVD is from a very good print.  -The DVD is in mono but sounds very good and clear with no noticeable no hiss.",1059177600,5,1251,4.402597402597403

I don't mean that cynically, but it is an interesting observation vis a vis the book's central premise. Many others deal with plot, etc.; I want to focus on Truffaut's ""translation"" of Bradbury's work. I've tried several times to make it to the end of this movie, and I just can't do it. The langorous pace may be intended to reflect the culture in which Montag exists; however, the whole ""New Wave"" sensibility of the film just doesn't fit the gritty, urgent message I believe Bradbury wants to convey. The central metaphor of the book is ignition: not just the ignition of all books and the world of ideas, but the conflagration that occurs in the human mind once it begins to percolate with ideas and in the heated chase that Montag must undertake once he forsakes all for the life of books and ideas. This contrasts starkly with Truffaut's treatment, and it left me bored and wishing some other director had taken Bradbury's masterpiece and done it justice.",1056844800,4,1085,4.626943005181347
227589,4,6300184250,"This truly unusual and period movie (the 60's) was a subject of comment by the original author of the popular book, Ray Bradbury. He claimed that the movie improved on his original book ending. The direction here has probably one of the greatest improv's of film. In the beginning there are no words used to introduce the movie. Rather we are shown a sequence of Television antenna-laced rooftops and the ""titles"" are spoken. This continues as our hero picks up a ""newspaper"", but upon close inspection we see that it is only picture sequences. The best aspect of this work is the score. Bernard Hermann is responsible for what can only be described as ""atmospheric"" music and it is a standout. Oscar Werner, in all fairness, was crucified by critics for his performance and the way he played the central character, in retrospect, this was unfair and I sometimes believe that critics make comments without reading anything about the material. Werner obviously read the book! Remember that ""firemen"" in this future society are not ""intellectuals"" and what we see is how he eventually wakes up and discovers the value of knowledge. Werner plays this perfectly, and he eventually values knowledge more than his life, after the shock of witnessing a suicide by an old woman who refuses to leave her books as they are burned. In reality the director wanted to show how a man transforms from his discovery of the word and the re-discovery of the ""I"". (ala' Ayn Rand) In the end, he flees the controlled, drug infested and false reporting society of the city to live with a group in the outskirts of civilization intent on preserving the great books of culture during the dark age of this dismal future. It is thought provoking and worth a view. Just remember that it is a ""period"" movie and suffers from a lot of 60's pop art and clothing.",1055203200,4,1833,4.73125

Excluding the book-burning, the plot is rather pedestrian : and it is unfortunately obvious that Truffault, a lover of books himself, was not afraid to be pretentious.
His elegy of books is extreme, and one wonders, with one of the antagonists, whether philosophy books are not just ""everyone saying they're right and everyone else is wrong"". Fahrenheit 451 quickly switches from being a parody of mediocrity to a parody of elitism. The end scenes, with a group of people who commit a book to memory and bind their identity to that of the text, only confirm the pretentiousness of the discourse given to us.
There are some good parts here and there (such as the beautiful images of fire and pages withering and blackening, and the public television show offering members of ""The Family"" a chance to be an actor - the whole thing is, of course, staged).

There is no old professor type helping Montag, the great captain of the firemen is poorly done.  The last scene we are confronted by proto hippies that have memorized books and taken on the books persona, instead of older gentleman disenfranchised by government control.

The different supplements tend to repeat each other, for one, down to copying the film's famous credit sequence.  I wish the Bernard Herrman segment had focused a little more on the music in the film, instead of his personal problems.
Audio commentary is one of the best things DVD technology offers - too bad it wasn't used to better advantage in this case.

Each time a new person starts talking, they are re-introduced, which gets rather annoying.

227606,5,6300184250,"I do not understand people who knock this film. It is enjoyable for both those who have read the book and those who haven't.
One of the good signs of a movie adaptation is if it follows the ""spirit"" of the film. Screenwriting should be simply ripping the pages out of the book, and stuffing them in the camera. It does not have to be exact, or have all the same events. It should capture the spirit and ideas of the book. I think this movie does it with flying colours.
Although the acting is stiff, that is what Truffaut wanted. To make it seem removed and lifeless, like what the world would be without books. It becomes kind of unnerving, and disturbing. Which is the idea. Although there are parts of the book missing, this movie catches the spirit of the film. Although there are a couple of problems with the film i.e. ""How can Montag be able to read when there are no printed words"", but that problem is in the book too...
For those who care, this movie contains footage of the SAFEGE monorail test track, which no longer exists. It was a revolutionary style of monorail, the most important feature being the escape ladder, which is used prominently in the movie.
I think this is a wonderful adaptation of a wonderful book. F451 is probably my favorite book. It is thought provoking and makes you want to read the book, which is another sign of a good movie. Finally, Ray Bradbury himself liked this adaptation of this book, which should at least merit a watch of this movie. This is worthy of 5 stars.",1047081600,6,1509,4.431654676258993

I'm sure Frank Darabont will be more than willing to turn this into a overly sentimental melodramatic waste of screen time like The Green Mile or The Majestic (I'll give him credit for The Shawshank Redemption, a genuine masterpiece, its not exactly a literal adaption of the source material).

227611,4,6300184250,"No one ever said that Hollywood was morally required to maintain the vision, the ethos, the scope of the book from which the movie was made.  The jump from paper to screen is too vast to permit more than a taste of the original. With Fahrenheit 451, Francois Truffaut capably manages to maintain the balancing act of the increasing inner turmoil of the book burning fireman Guy Montag with a selected few of the mind-rending themes from the novel by Ray Bradbury.
  In his novel, Bradbury had the time and luxury to explore in detail the many themes of his richly textured work, most notably the interacting triangle of technology, education, and human ennui.  In the movie version, Truffaut hints at how human society has perverted this triangle to arrive at the social structure that Bradbury thought not too far from his own.
  Oskar Werner plays a deeply troubled Guy Montag whose surface joy at being a fireman is quickly put to the test by a light-headed female neighbor (Clarisse, a double role by Julie Christie, who also plays his wife Linda). One of the minor themes of the book is also present in the film: that the love of books is contagious. Both book and film play up this disease metaphor with fire as the cauterizing agent.  Clarisse 'infects' Guy early on with an innocuous question--'Are you happy?' Guy, of course, thinks that he is, but he soon resorts to stealing the books that he is supposed to burn. The turning point for Guy and the audience is the scene where an old woman chooses to die with her books than to live without them. Just before she self-immolates, she cries out to the firemen (interestingly enough, she looks at Guy as if she senses that he is ripe for infection), ""Books are alive; they speak to me!""  Later, when Guy is trying to convince Linda, whose brain is surely turned to mush-paste by the enemy of free thought, interactive television, he uses much the same phrasing. Still later, Guy attempts to reach Linda's female friends by reading to them from a forbidden book. The result in both cases is the same. Both Linda and her friends are 'immune' to the infection.
  Cyril Cusack, as fire Chief Beatty, has a much reduced role. In the novel, he provides much needed background so that the mad world of his society has some philosophical underpinning. Truffaut uses Beatty mostly as a flat character who stands in opposition to Montag's re-humanification. Still, Cusack manages to invest his character with the subtext as one who is driven to suicide to counter the deadening insensitivity of the world that he partly helped to create. Why else would he give a known traitor a flamethrower after telling Guy that he was under arrest?
  The end of the film shows a society in which all surviving book lovers combine to prepare for the day when they will emerge from the shadows of a nuclear war to infect others with the notion that it is not books that are bad, but rather it is the use to which words are put that makes them so.  The closing scene of a kindly, dying old man teaching his forbidden knowledge to his youthful successor teaches us too that books are no more than a metaphor for the mind. To destroy the one is to destroy the other.",1018137600,11,3195,4.60387323943662
227612,3,6300184250,"Based on the legendary book, the movie does a good job in depicting the not-too-distant future in which in books are banned and firemen are used to enforce the ban by burning books.
The society is presented as facist, with children reciting their multiplication tables in an emotionless, almost mechanical manner, people learning self-defense on massive, almost monstrous television screens, or the public gleefully laughing as police forcefully give one of those ""long haired sooty intellectual types"" a haircut.
Regretfully, it loses its ""fire"" at the end.  While the book ends with World War III (or is it IV?) breaking out, the movie ends with the hero in a commune of free thinkers, and a boy learning a story.

227636,5,6300184250,"Truffaut delivers an amazing film. The stilted dialogue and artificial manner of the actors, often criticized, actually contributes to the vision of a future society in which all intellectual reflection and creativity has been supressed and stifled. I have heard it said that Werner wanted to play the character of Montag as a fascist, whereas Truffaut wanted Montag to have a more vulnerable appearance. Truffaut seems to have got his way, and it works remarkably well. The scene in which Montag picks his way, word by word, through the opening lines of Dicken's 'David Copperfield' is truly moving. Similarly, other citizens of this synthetic state reveal their vulnerability at various points as they struggle to express their suppressed humanity (eg. the commuters touching themselves on the train; Linda's friend fighting to hold back her tears as Montag 'cruelly' recites from a novel).
This is a film that warns of the dangers of living in a cultural and historical vacuum. To quote Goethe: 'He who refuses to draw on three thousand years of history is living from hand to mouth.' The world Truffaut (in turn inspired by Ray Bradbury's novella) envisages, is a world in which the present is unconnected to anything else. Houses have always been fireproof, remarks Montag. It has always been the duty of firemen to start fires (in order to burn books), never to put them out. It is a poor world, where the dullest and most lacklustre conversation is lapped up by the masses as entertainment (the cousin's play). I know many people who live hand to mouth like that, to borrow Goethe's metaphor. Truffaut's warning is for them.
Sets and effects are generally rather lame, though they are compensated for by Bernard Herrmann's excellent (as usual) score. There are myriad memorable sequences in which the music combines brilliantly with Roeg's photography to great effect (Montag and Linda's love scene; the final 'book people' scene). Truffaut's love of literature and culture is evident at every point, and a knowledge of his other films will demonstrate why he found Bradbury's book such enticing material.",1004659200,,2112,5.089337175792507
227637,4,6300184250,"There are many who haven't cared for this movie since it first came out in the mid-Sixties, and they're right to say that it's not very much like the Bradbury novel it's based on, the special effects are largely terrible (the wires helping to levitate the police jetpacks are comically evident), and Oskar Werner seems surprisingly stiff in the lead role of Montag (as Truffaut himself admitted, Werner lost all the spontaeity he showed in JULES ET JIM and seems to be working at his acting very painfully).
All that being said, this film is nevertheless a minor classic. It is one of the most thoughtful and atmospheric science fiction films ever made, and has an absolutely thrilling Bernard Herrmann score to compliment the gorgeous Nicholas Roeg photography. The closeups of the books burning are in particular quite stunning and oddly poignant--one book burns only one page at a time, as each subsequent sheet of paper curls up and vanishes--so that they seem like little murders. The film also features one of Julie Christie's greatest performances as the emotionally anesthetized and intellectually infantile housewife Linda (oddly, she was originally only cast in the more typical role for her of the rebel Clarice, but when Truffaut was left at the last minute without a Linda he asked her to double roles--much to the film's enrichment).
The closing sequence of the book reciting their novels in the light snow is justly famous, but there are few truffaut films with so many ""classic sequences"": the old woman burning herself down atop her pile of confiscated books as a political protest; Linda's near-fatal (and immediately forgotten) drug overdose, and her subsequent recovery; the idiotic audience-participation show she and Montag watch on the wallscreen; and the great montage sequence showing the people on Montag's monorail tram fondling themselves and kissing their reflections, underscoring both the loneliness and narcissism of this society.

As a HUGE book lover, I was absolutely mesmerized by this tale of a society that not only has censored all books, but also has firemen who hunt down culprits who harbor books and then burn them at 451 degrees, the heat needed to burn paper.  It is French director Truffaut's only English language film, which does not hurt it in the least.  This is an incredibly dull society of people who don't do much other than sit in front of tv-like screens watching approved programing put on by the state. Some of them also go to work on public transit although they do nothing that requires reading.  There are no road signs, no newspapers, no menus, not a shred of visible written matter anywhere in this society.

Children in schoolrooms do solely mass oral memorization.  For written matter gives people ideas and this society decides it is better to live without ideas.  Why one wants to live without ideas remains an unasked question in this culture.  Oskar Werner plays the fireman who gets more and more intrigued by these books he's burning. Julie Christie plays two roles: a rebel who sides with the book harborers and Werner's wife, who is a couch potato living in front of the tv-screen most of the day.  I was amazed to see that Werner's clothes and hair looked right up to the minute despite this film's being several decades old.  You would think he was a young actor in 2001. The resolution of this film is absolutely wonderful and thus I won't say a word about it so as to spoil it for you.

227640,4,6300184250,"Generally considered a misguided experiment, FAHRENHEIT 451 is actually preferable to many of Franois Truffaut's more acclaimed works. Its flaws derive largely from Bradbury's novel, while its virtues are almost all original. Truffaut, for example, did not invent the ludicrous inconsistency of a totalitarian society that bans and burns books while allowing a bunch of vagrants to wander around loose memorizing them. Such inanities started with Bradbury; Truffaut simply failed to edit them out.
The film presents a much more complex situation than the novel's self-flattering contrast between evil book burners and virtuous bibliophiles. Are book worms really so life-loving? Truffaut shows their behavior as disturbingly similar to alcoholics and drug addicts, and it's worth noting that Montag becomes a murderer only *after* he has been awakened to the pleasures of print. If Truffaut hadn't had a prestigious career as a critic to prove his literary bona fides, the swoon of Bernard Hermann's lush strings between the snap, crackle and pop of flames salaciously licking up pages curling into ash would amply testify to his religious awe in their presence. These images do something else, though. The book burning is quite simply gorgeous, and by confronting us with just how beautiful such ""barbarism"" can be, Truffaut pulls the rug out from under us.
The basic story is Bradbury's, but the film inverts sympathy. The plastic book burners may be twits, but they are human twits. When Cyril Cusack (in a wonderful performance) says that the Firemen are working in mankind's interest by removing the stress of ideas, he has a point. The book lovers as presented certainly aren't an attractive alternative. They learn books and emptily recite them. They don't criticize or debate them and there is no hint any of them could write one. Despite the Barbizon School-like delicacy of Nicholas Roeg's photography in the concluding sequences, nothing about their lives is appealing. If we're honest with ourselves, most of us are far closer to the bland, conformist suburbanites of the book burners than to the shabby book people. (The movie provides a chillingly ironic mise-en-abyme for anyone watching it on a widescreen TV since Montag's wall screen matches theirs almost perfectly.)
This ambivalence about the subject makes the film far more insightful than the book. About the same time he was directing FAHRENHEIT, Truffaut conducted his famous interviews with Alfred Hitchcock. There are some sub-Hitchcockian flourishes in the film, such as subjective camera stalking sequences, and a bad imitation of the ""Vertigo effect."" Bernard Hermann was almost certainly chosen to write the score because of his work with Hitchcock. The really important lesson Truffaut seems to have learned, however, was Hitchcock's point that a thriller stands or falls on the strength of the villain. By giving the bad guys an excellent argument and by implicating us in their villainy, Truffaut's FAHRENHEIT 451 is a cut above the pulp from which it was taken.",975628800,4,3045,5.2804123711340205
227641,4,6300184250,"As a stand-alone this movie is very good.  When compared to the novel on which it is based, it is, well, not so good.
But, we are just talking about the movie, so here's my thoughts.  The movie captures the unemotional feel of the book completely.  This backdrop must've been very useful for the director.  Montag is really not an outwardly emotional guy - not many people are in that culture - so when he has a breakthrough, or makes an emotional connection, or feels panic and bewilderment, although it is muted, it stands out boldly on this bland atmosphere.  We can sense the confusion he feels when the old lady is burning herself and her books, we can see his panic in the Captain's office as he searches for Clarisse's file, we can understand the pain he feels with Clarisse as he comforts her in the elevator at the school.
This is not all Werner's show.  Christie is superb in the dual role of Linda and Clarisse (exuding youth and exuberance from Clarisse and lifeless conformity from Linda).  The other actors also perform well, but none are a big enough role to stand out.
The film definitely has some just plain bad moments.  The first that springs to mind is the hovercraft police searching for Montag.  That was so embarrassingly low-budget that my hand, of it's own freewill, grasped the remote and fast-forwarded until the hovercraft were off of the radar screen (a surreal experience for sure).  I was also unimpressed with the ending.  No specific complaint there, it just didn't work for me.  However, the old man teaching the boy ""his"" book was a moving scene.
All in all, a rewarding experience.  And a great score by Bernard Herrmann!",972864000,4,1657,4.652920962199313
227642,5,6300184250,"A biting futuristic satire of a television led world where the literary stimulated are the enemies of a misological state. Traffaut's use of anachronisms: 1920's telephones and fire engines suggests this stultifying  conformity and mind control are fertile today. Julie Christie is  outstanding as the automaton housewive, forever pill popping, and the  maverick school teacher who is the catalyst for Montag's awakening. I love  this film's high strangeness. One scene in particular- the teacher and  Montag go to her school to collect her belongings, she as been dismissed  for being too animated with the children. Montag waits in the background as  she walks down a narrow corridor. A teacher's head appears from a door, It  is a fireman from Montag's station in a blonde wig and make-up ( a pun on  Christie's dual role?), he/she throws the bag of belongings into the  corridor and it slides improbably to Christie's feet.

Nic Roeg's cinematopraphy is a stand out, and you can see his little  red touches that presaged DONT LOOK NOW, and, honestly, its one of the more  compelling films for me in the Truffaut canon. Of course, Julie Christie  plays two parts, and I, admittedly, would pay to watch her sew a sweater.  And Bernard Herrmann delivers an at turns icy and heartbreaking score.  Yes, it is cold, but isn't it kinda cold in cyberspace, too, as they  predicted it would be? I mean, can we really touch?",957571200,4,640,4.474137931034483
227664,4,6300184250,"Science-fiction and french directors form an impossible couple. With the exception of Luc Besson's THE FIFTH ELEMENT, this country hasn't produced any major movies of this peculiar genre for decades. Too reasonable and  rational, french directors preferred to specialize themselves in light  psychological comedies, a genre they master. So I was a little anxious as I  put the DVD in my player. After all, the Truffaut-Bradbury encounter in  FAHRENHEIT 451 has often been described by the critics as the worst of  Franois Truffaut movies.
Surprise, surprise. FAHRENHEIT 451 is not as  bad as I expected, on the contrary, I liked it very much because it keeps  you in a state of intellectual alert during almost two hours. But don't  expect any special effects here ! The purpose of Franois Truffaut wasn't  to create a society of the future nor to enumerate the discoveries our  followers will certainly make. In fact, one has often the feeling that  Truffaut is presenting a regressive world rather than a future world. Look  carefully at the details like, for example, the telephones, very 1920-like,  or the group of firemen that could easily take place in one of the short  movies of the Keystone cops.
OK ! I admit that FAHRENHEIT 451 is a very  cold movie but many other Truffaut's movies present this characteristic  and, in my opinion, it adds to the strangeness and the peculiarity of  FAHRENHEIT. And I think that the last scenes involving the "" Book Men  "" are terrific and could justify your investment.
A scene access as  sole extra feature (Thank you, thank you).
A DVD to rediscover.",957312000,9,1598,4.895522388059701
227665,3,6300184250,"Francois Truffaut's only English language film, based on the Ray Bradburry novel deals with a future where the mere fact of owning books is a crime and firemen enter and search houses to eliminate any work of literature;  anything from ""Lolita"" to issues of ""Cahiers du  Cinema."" I thought this was a great, impressive film. The way Truffaut  envisioned the future (even though somewhat dated by today's standards) was  eerily on the money. The power and influence of television over what we  think and do is evident here. The performances by Oskar Werner and Julie  Christie (in a dual role) were just right; detached individuals who serve  as a prototype of what our society indeed has become.",956707200,9,695,4.888888888888889
227666,2,6300184250,"Although I have seen this film a long time ago, it will never leave my memory. Cut, pasted, and altered to such that it is quite near unrecognizable, Fahrenheit 451 mixes laughable props with an idiotic  script. So bad it's funny, the film follows the book only barely, at best.  While the key part is still the fact that the society rejects literature  and rational thought, and whole-heartedly embraces screaming TV shows,  ultra-high speed driving, and senseless chatting, as all books are burned  by ""firemen"", the overall mood of the setting is no longer the  happy-go-lucky idiocy, but a depressed, fearful feel. Granted, much of the  book's scenes would be impossible to replicate with the technology of the  day, but the numerous flaws are simply unforgivable. From a  super-Americanized society of the book, Truffault created a society of  Nazis. Most of the actors are blonde and blue-eyed. Especially unforgivable  scenes are the flying policemen, the ""firemen school"", the way  they burn books (in a grill), and especially the way one sends in a secret  tip to the firemen (through the mail). The ending (and, for that matter,  most of the film) is ruinous.",953942400,2,1169,4.989637305699482

It is in no way lacking any passion, Werner's acting is abundant in this. The film appears  bleak because of the reality of such a thing happening. As a society we  would be powerless to stop it. The idea of this especially in the form of a  film is frightning so we shut it out and dismiss it as being  ""lame"" while we give rave reviews to such trash as  ""Sream"" and

227669,1,6300184250,"As an English teacher I had hoped to introduce one of film's greatest directors to my students after we read Bradbury's novel.  Unfortunately it happens to be one of the worst book-to-screen translations ever.
The  film's biggest weakness is its lack of emotion.  Granted, Bradbury's  characters live in a  society that represses love, but they are still  capable of intense passions--Montag especially.  The film, by contrast, is  muted and dry.  The characters never show the fascinating spirit that  drives Bradbury's novel.  In the film, having them so emotionally barren  makes it impossible for us to care about what happens to them.
The film  is also weak in its lack of special effects--not in terms of eye candy, but  to display Bradbury's great verbal visuals.  Bradbury shows us houses  blazing against the night sky, a robotic dog relentlessly pursuing its  prey, and a near-apocalyptic climax that ties together the story's physical  and spiritual tensions.  Truffaut ignores these things and gives us special  effects that would make Ed Wood cringe.
One compliment to the movie: the  sequence with the woman who martyrs herself for her books is absolutely  brilliant.  Unfortunately, it only serves to emphasize the movie's other  extremely numerous flaws.  Skip this version, read Bradbury, and hope for a  fiery, more intense version in the future.",942710400,36,1364,5.227906976744186

The detatched quality of the direction mirrors the detatchment of this tv  obsessed society but even so I can't help feeling that there is real warmth  in this film. The sequence of the living books in the snowy forest is  genuinely touching. But speaking as someone who is interested in the art of  title sequences, I have to say that the opening sequence's absence of  moving images and typography is a stroke of genius - extremely direct,  unexpected and as good a use of decisions regarding graphic design in the  movies as you could get.
