7696370,4,B01D2TK12C,"Good war/action movie that has a higher than expected body count among the lead actors. Those like me who came to see Scott Adkins kick butt will be disappointed. Here, he's playing a commanding officer who uses a gun, not his fists. However, it's clear the movie is intended to be about military conflict and not martial arts. Overall, this is a keeper for the DVD collection.",1466380800,,377,4.641791044776119

7696373,5,B01D2TK12C,"I don't review movies that often, but I felt compelled to after this one being as it only had three stars. It deserves more. While most people will probably look at this and think it is just another direct to video sequel, they'd be wrong in this case. This one stands on its own.

The story borrows a lot from the situation in Benghazi, but not so much as to make it seem like a blatant rip off. The characters are all well-written and well-played and the action is intense once it gets going. And it takes a little bit to get going. But that's a good thing. The production team took time to let the characters breathe and actually become human in the eyes of the audience instead of just being cardboard cutouts with assault rifles.

I was amazed at the detail of the gun work. In most action movies you see huge gunfights without anyone ever changing a magazine or running out of ammo unless it serves the plot in some major way. Not here  the guns are handled very professionally and it looks fantastic. Especially the reach around charging technique used by the female CIA agent. It's a very real technique and I don't think I've ever seen it in a movie.

Anyways I'll quit rambling. Check this movie out.",1465516800,7,1210,4.4125560538116595
7696374,3,B01D2TK12C,"Jarhead 3: The Siege,"" despite the number attached to its title, is a stand-alone action film. Apart from the fact that its main character is a Marine, theres no relation to 2005s Jarhead, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Assigned to protect a seemingly safe U.S. Embassy in a fictional Middle East country, Marine Corporal Evan Albright (Charlie Weber) thought he wasn't going to see much action. When an extremist force launches a surprise attack aimed at killing an Embassy informant, Albrights team is caught off guard, out-gunned and outnumbered. With national security at stake, an international crisis ensues.

A competent B-movie script and sketchy production values reflect the films minuscule budget. The Middle East in the picture doesnt look authentic at all and was probably shot in the California desert. Though the setting is modern, the style is reminiscent of the many ultra-patriotic World War II flicks Hollywood tuned out in the 1940s. Characters are mostly painted in broad strokes of black and white from the outset. However, there are  departures when a few Arab characters are portrayed in a non-cliched manner.

Weber is adequate as the lead character, but doesnt possess star power. Martial arts star Scott Adkins makes an all-too-brief appearance as a gunnery sergeant, enlivening the proceedings and adding some humor to the testosterone-driven action. Keep in mind that this is not a movie with outstanding acting. The gunfights and explosions are the real stars.

The only bonus extra on the 2-disc Blu-ray./DVD Combo Pack is a making-of featurette. A digital HD copy is included.",1465171200,,1603,5.25
7696375,3,B01D2TK12C,"""Sometimes being a good Marine means coming in last."" Evan Albright (Weber) has just arrived for his new assignment guarding an American Embassy located in the Kingdom. His ego and attitude don't endear him to his fellow soldiers or commanders. When someone comes into the building he is guarding and things erupt outside everything changes. Now, him and the little group of guards must not only protect those inside the building, but the entire Embassy itself. This is a movie that tried so hard to be like 13 Hours, and actually wasn't terrible. Considering the budget restraints this movie had this was actually pretty decent and worth watching. It never became overly cheesy or laughable even though it came close a few times. This is becoming one of the best B action movie series' and it didn't try to do too much, which actually helped the movie. This is nothing comparable to 13 Hours, but for what it was it was entertaining and very watchable. Overall, worth watching and is pretty entertaining. A low budget 13 Hours that is worth your time. I give this a B.",1464998400,4,1069,4.721925133689839
