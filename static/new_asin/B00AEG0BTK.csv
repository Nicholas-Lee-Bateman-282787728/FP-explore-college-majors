8550465,4,B00AEG0BTK,"I had been looking for this documentary for several years & finally found it on DVD. Narrated by movie star Martin Sheen, this documentary focuses of the very real menace earthquakes pose both in the United States and across the globe. Interviews with USGS specialist Dr. Lucy Jones and other geologists focus on the attempts to find a method to predict these deadly events. The show also examines a number of historical earthquakes including the Alaska quake of the 1960s, the 1989 San Francisco quake, the 1994 Northridge quake in Los Angeles, the 1923 Tokyo/Yokohama quake and the 1993 Okushiri earthquake & tsunami.

Although this is over 20 years old now it is still relevant and informative. This is a particularly fascinating documentary on quakes. Highly recommended.",1471392000,,775,5.102362204724409
