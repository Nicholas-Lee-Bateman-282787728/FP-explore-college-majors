5540587,4,B00B18FA50,"I stumbled across this series by accident one Sunday night on ITV and became fascinated. As the reviewers above have discussed in detail there is some unevenness in the story and character development and to be expected the acting and it's hard to know why but despite these flaws - or maybe because of them - since the series is based on a real character and events which are by definition flawed - you are captivated and just want to see and learn more about Mr. Selfridge and his time in London. I became fascinated by his story through this series and desperately wanted to learn more about him. I've now ordered the book the series is based on as well as the book Mr. Selfridge wrote himself in the '30s - ""The Romance of Capitalism"". I learnt that many things we consider 'normal' in retail today were introduced by Mr. Selfridge - ""There are only  'x' more shopping Days 'till Christmas""; the customer is always right; special events to get people into a store; getting shoppers into a store without any specific purpose - just to 'window-shop' and keep them in there longer than needed to buy the item they came in for by having a store restaurant (The Palm Room) a reading room, relaxing room etc. - were all innovations put into practice by Mr. Selfridge and are woven into the series. It's a fascinating story and the series does a good job getting this larger than life person and personality onto a tiny screen. Thanks for a good job done - I can't wait for Season 2!",1363996800,156,1480,4.481481481481482
5540588,5,B00B18FA50,"This series has much going for it IMO. I agree with the first reviewer and her comments. I am an older guy. I looked forward  to each episode...all 10. I hope there is a S2. I know little of Mr. Selfridge but I enjoyed the story. A good story based on a good % of truth, even better? Perhaps I will look into this story and learn more about Mr. Selfridge.

 It seems that taking license is just par for the course for many films. Take Lincoln for example and Argo..there are errors, omissions and this bugs a lot of people. As one Canadain said about Argo ""it's their film and they can make it as they please"". Regardless...the story got out and more people than ever got to know the 'real' story. Films have to make money. Sometimes the 'truth' is not all that exciting....like our daily lives.",1363046400,15,795,4.322147651006712
5540589,5,B00B18FA50,"While I know the first season of Mr. Selfridge has yet to be released, I actually had the opportunity to view it on-line from the UK. If the next season(s) progresses in the manner this season did, I believe it's a hit.  I read ""Shopping, Seduction and Mr. Selfridge"" a while back before viewing the show.  This production obviously takes dramatic license in many regards, but that can be forgiven as long as one realizes that some of the events few might be based on real events, others are added or are the result of some rumors and speculations.

I believe Jeremy Piven shares only a few physical characteristics (stature, build, energy and moustache) of the real Selfridge, but he managed to be very believable in the role.  The character is played with both sensitivity and sometimes flare.  He has a ridge facade up when he's being watched, but when the only eye on him is the camera, we're able to see another side of pain and self-doubt to the infamous Harry Selfridge.  Piven and the writers were able to make Harry Selfridge both seriously flawed and noble at the same time. You can be angry with him and love him simultaneously.  No small feat.  It was refreshing to see Piven in a role that had such a completely different vibe than the renown Ari Gold character from Entourage.  He obviously is able to calibrate his performance to the script; this series pretty much proves that.

The ensemble of characters works very well, and the numerous story arcs keep one's interest.  The character of Agnes Towler (Aisling Loftus)is a delight to watch as the character starts to blossom under the store and window lights of the store.  While a supporting character, Ron Cook (Mr. Crabb) manages to be often pulls off the nonplussed and bewildered, yet always competent accountant in an endearing manner. Again, many of the characters are human and flawed.  There is a sense of comraderie as they go about the business and showmanship of the retail stage that is Selfridge's.  I'm definitely planning on purchasing this series for my collection.

Bravo!",1362960000,86,2057,4.771186440677966

5540598,3,B00B18FA50,"I binge watched this season and I can't even now decide if I really liked it or not.

I can tell you what I wasn't a fan of.. Jeremy Piven...his portrayal of Mr Selfridge was just over the top for me. He was so over the top in his acting that it came across as forced and instead of losing myself in the episodes as I watched them.

Every scene with Mr Selfridge...and the over the top acting...pulled me back out. I felt like a yo yo watching this...because the story line is FANTASTIC...but Piven's acting...disappointing

The supporting cast was phenomenal...it's because of them that I continued to watch",1503100800,,608,4.559633027522936

In all his brilliance, he was after all, only human, yet, as is noted by one of the journalists in the series, he ""seems to have more hours in his day than the rest of us"", lol.  I appreciate that the writers, cast and director are careful not to turn him into a stereotypical megalomaniac but, if you know what to look for, the mania comes through so clearly.

5540680,5,B00B18FA50,"I watched this whole miniseries when it was on PBS. I loved it and looked so forward to the next episode. I, especially, like Agnes Towler, who starts out as a shop girl, but she has ambition and talent that takes her far. I enjoy watching sexy Henri. Even his walk is sexy. He swaggers, not walks.

All of the other characters deepen and grow throughout the series. But, Mr. Selfridge, himself, is enigmatic and a dreamer, who believes he can do it no matter what.

I was ecstatic when I found I can watch the whole miniseries with my Prime membership. In the meantime, hubby can watch his shows on our TV. Now that I've cut cable, even more than before, I will be spending time watching this again.

While I know, from research I've done, that the show wasn't true to the real life of Mr. Selfridge, I still enjoy the version that is represented, and it is pretty close to the truth.

I will buy the seasons, separately, so I can watch the DVD's on my TV. That is how much I like this show. I don't buy DVD's that often as I hardly ever watch them unless I really like a movie or show. So, that, in itself, says something about Mr. Selfridge.",1485820800,4,1144,4.258064516129032

Even while it turned me off to the show I realized that might be the premise is that even he didn't believe what he said so he was ""acting"" in front of the crowds... but I'd watched a similar show called ""Paradise"" whose main character truly seemed to believe all he was saying and after that, I just couldn't get into Mr. Selfridge",1482364800,,481,4.4772727272727275

5540884,4,B00B18FA50,I enjoy it and the character development.  There is a problem with the picture stoping and the sound continuing and then both stop.

5540892,5,B00B18FA50,"Relevant plot for today, gorgeous costuming, and the acting ensemble was excellent. PBS should be proud of this product. Of course, PBS has a history of artistic offerings. After several seasons, one must confess that each of the characters warranted our emotional reactions as an audience, the fantasy, often times, churning our guts and startling our expectations. Aspiration can, indeed, be thwarted by our character flaws, these deficiencies often revealed too late or too soon. Narcissism easily transforms lofty goals to pretense and hypocrisy. Like some of the characters in the series, epiphany can occur too late to serve positively in our lives. The conflict between adventure and carelessness is readily apparent, and love so often be bitter sweet. It seems very Christian in outlook, many of the characters torn between idols of the world and divinity. As social mores are questioned, altered, or cast aside, we witness very human beings torn between creative and destructive goals.",1481932800,,994,5.337579617834395

Everything from the story line to the acting is terrific. It's about an American business man who opens up a unique type of department store (set in early 1900's or about) in London. You go through the trials and tribulations of the owner and his family and what it takes to make everything work. You also follow the employees of the store and their lives.

The characters were getting immorally involved and that was disappointing to me. I wanted a clean show that I could watch with my kids about a charismatic man who had huge dreams that he made come true and how he dealt with obstacles, but it was focusing on him giving into immorality.

Such as showing the women's clothes and accessories, how they sort through them and make decisions regarding what to sell, etc. There should also be more ""fitting scenes"" , i.e. men's tailors fitting them for suits and overcoats. I know they didn't buy everything off the rack back then. I believe they're addressing it some more in the second season, but Im only half-way through it.",1479254400,,509,4.655555555555556

He's a good boss, he's fair, and he cares about his people. He expects their best and he gets it without question.  The only thing wrong with him is that he likes the ladies and thinks it's ok to have them on the side and keep his lovely wife and kids as well, without problems.  Fortunately his wife feels like I do she just doesn't show it as quickly as I would..but those are the rules of that era...women are in the background.  Anyhow...

It was a great guilty pleasure type of show for me - I'd settle in with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the drama. But what kept me coming back was the fact that between all the over the top acting and drama were some real moments with some of the supporting cast. I found myself rooting for them and watching to see how their adventures would turn out.

The main actor is phenomenal.  He is so wells spoken, so compelling, so interesting that its impossible to not want to know what happens in the next episode.
Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around
Con:
- The fourth season is the last season! 
- I don't get to shop at Mr. Selfridges",1476921600,,800,4.342281879194631

5541111,4,B00B18FA50,"Very entertaining period drama.  Fun story.  4 stars vs. 5 because material like this can't compete with the best of contemporary drama and especially premium-cable product.  To be clear, that observation is not a function of the period, costume-drama nature of the work.  Contrast this, e.g. with Peaky Blinders for a study in how you can do period work more - or in this case less - persuasively.  Come to think of it, even closer to home in terms of medium and audience, compare vs. Downton Abbey - also much more persuasively acted.  From the very first scene this production feels ""stagey"", but not evenly so.  The players vary greatly in their believability.  Jeremy Piven looks like he's acting on a stage, not like he's living the experience he's depicting.  But then that's JP.  But all that said - good family viewing at a time when most of the really top-notch work simply is not appropriate for younger viewers.",1476230400,,923,4.748427672955975

5541123,5,B00B18FA50,"Jeremy Piven does an okay job at being Mr. Selfridge, a larger than life  American business figure in conservative early 1900's British department store business and society. I think Robert Downer Jr  would have been the perfect actor for the role as he is naturally more flamboyant and eccentric but Piven does an adequate job. The contrast of conservative British characters that surround Mr. Selfridge and their back stories is an effective juxtaposition with Piven's character for the story's over arching theme and historical relevance of perseverance despite seemingly insurmountable social and market constraints. The show excels at creating a dynamic dramatic universe that surreptitiously extols the virtue and vicissitudes of the individualistic entrepreneurial spirit of commercial-marketing-social incite and vision. The show transforms Selfridge's life's work from an over looked footnote in the dustbin of Western commercial history to a truly entertaining panoply of game changing business acumen to make every Shark Tank judge envious. The creative license of partial fiction is as alluring a retelling of biography as I have encountered in the visual story telling arts. While there is room for superior elements of dramatic conveyance, the show is still a must see. Well done Producer and star Jeremy Piven!",1476057600,,1325,5.554455445544554

Mostly no store now or then would operate with out at least one security person. He says he has 2000 employees for one store? I was vice president of a store that was similar to Selfridge's and even in the 1890s when wages were rock bottom in retail there were never more than 50.

5541178,5,B00B18FA50,"A story of Harry Gordon Selfridge, a self-made man who started at Marshall Fields and brought department store shopping to downtown London. Took a few episode to get it's bearings, than became a very good fictional telling of a non-fictional story. Mid-way through the first season I began to believe in the actors...after that it was hard to resist. Would suggest you try not to worry about accuracy and instead focus on the overall tale. It's more fun that way. Very well produced period piece with a talented cast and an engrossing story based on historical events and people in early 1900's England.

The Downton Abby fan in me digs the set, the period, and they do an amazing job on the wardrobe.  Turns out everyone in the past was either really pretty or handsome and everyone was slim; who knew? The story is compelling, and for each episode, it seems to turn my TV in to a time machine window.

The first couple shows, while interesting, don't portray the emotional cost of some of the characters' choices, but the episodes increasingly become more realistic in the characters' interactions with each other.  I've just begun the second season, so I'm curious to see how they portray WWI and the effect it had on Europe.",1474416000,,490,4.939024390243903

Knowing that Selfridges is still in business and the story is based on the real Mr. Selfridge adds to its appeal.

If you are interested in period programs, you will love Mr. Selfridge.  It is very good -  and the actor that plays Mr. Selfridge makes the series.  The other characters play off of him nicely, and it is very enjoyable.  Lots of romance, back-stabbing, complicated emotional relationships, etc.  And it is about someone that actually existed.

Especially now that some of our domestic chains like Sears and Macy's are encountering such difficulties staying in business.,1473552000,,326,5.018518518518518

5541307,1,B00B18FA50,Perhaps Downton Abbey just set the bar too high or perhaps just our expectations...either way this show is a let down. The acting is less than stellar and the storyline quite dull. It never got off the ground and we dumped it after one episode.

We are only on Episode 5 of Season 1 but it is a series that captured our interest from the very get go.  Never really watched too much on PBS other than the specials at fund raising times but this series has peaked our interest to definitely check them out more thoroughly.

5541374,3,B00B18FA50,"Good cast and crew  to pull this one off for sure. It's  early 20th century England and we are  in the presence of  change in an industry that  we can all  do on our phones now. It was an era of personalization, attention to detail and a reverence for the English way, taught  by an American.  Nay  revolutionized  by an American.  Pivin pulls off  with a smile and some  range, impressive going from Ari Gold in Entourage  to PBS / Masterpiece Theater.  Pevin leads a cast and crew from across the pond in touch with one  of England's hallowed  commerce  halls, and  they all do a fin job of supporting our pioneer with solid  acting and  believability.  Overall a fun  watch to binge.  Of note on the production value when compared to other seasons this was a bit darker, overall ( lighting, not plot line)  but a good foundation, like every department store has to start somewhere and work its way up.  In This case there are 4 seasons that  go up, three of which are on Amazon prime.",1472774400,,987,4.368715083798882

5541383,5,B00B18FA50,"A classical example of PBS Masterpiece Theater.  Well produced, just the proper marriage of  stage production and TV. The ever evolving storyline, very theatrical scene design lend this series almost a documentary/historical appearance and appeal. Jeremy Piven as Mr Selfridge is good, not over the top, thus believable. Cast very carefully chosen and on the spot, especially Amanda Abbington as Miss Mardle. A show for the whole family, good entertainment without gratuitous violence and sex. Even with  four seasons under the belt the show keeps me and our family interested.

5541840,3,B00B18FA50,"From a historical drama perspective, I was drawn in by the intriguing world of Selfridge's as a store. However, the show itself can be hit-or-miss.

Jeremy Piven shouts through pretty much the entire season (my favorite episode was when he was in a coma, if that tells you anything), and he has this really annoying, creepy grin-stare. I often fast-forwarded scenes with him in it. The theme song echoes Piven's obnoxiousness: it's loud, brassy, and annoying. The part of Lady Mae also seems mis-casted: it's hard to believe in her as a genuine character.

Although some of the characters intrigue me (Miss Towler, Mrs. Selfridge), most of the men in this show, aside from the beautiful French window-dresser, are pretty annoying.

Summary: if you can overlook some acting quirks and a measure of cliche writing, then you may enjoy the nostalgic world of Selfridge's.",1466812800,,867,5.006944444444445

5541843,5,B00B18FA50,Mr. Selfridge was the PT Barnam/ Donald Trump of the 1900's and built a first class department store that is world famous today. Very enjoyable look at the lives of the key people involved.,1466812800,,189,4.588235294117647
5541844,1,B00B18FA50,We did not enjoy this and will not finish watching the season.  The actual production and costumes and sets were good but the whole premise of sexual theme of betraying their  wives or husbands was offensive to us.,1466812800,,214,4.605263157894737
5541845,1,B00B18FA50,I was quite disappointed. This show seemed to be more about extra-marital affairs than the revolution of the department store. Not appealing at all.,1466812800,,148,5.208333333333333

Even though some of the acting of Jeremy Piven is over the top, I really like this light-hearted series.  Sometimes one just likes to be entertained.  Mr. Selfridge is, of course, the center of this drama, but the cast members are individually intriguing with their own stories.  The energy of the show is what draws one to it along with the period clothing.  It's interesting to see the many sides of the characters, but don't expect Downton Abbey.  Expect some fluffy entertainment without much depth and you will enjoy it.",1465084800,,669,4.8584070796460175

Based on Selfridge's life, the series moves forward at a great pace, keeping you absorbed in the lives of the people who surround Selfridge and, of course, the man himself.  Selfridge's determination, power, external optimism and refusal to accept anything less than what he aims for are invigorating.  Few people have that ability, so it is interesting to see someone who actually does.  He is far from flawless and his weaknesses are just as obvious as his considerable strengths.

5542179,5,B00B18FA50,"Another great Masterpiece series based on historical events and characters.  Excellent cast of characters and the story is informative and entertaining presenting a good balance of what was good and not so good in the early 1900's.  Must of us have heard of Harrod's, but Selfridge's is a story that would be of considerable interest to us who enjoy learning about America's history, since this hugely successful store was established by an American from Chicago.  The store is still located on Oxford Street and additional stores are located in Birmingham and Manchester.  The story does a very good job of portraying the frailties and strengths of its main characters in a realistic manner.  It is always good to learn about success stories, and even better to understand the trials and tribulations associated with these success stories.  Looking forward to Season 2.",1463875200,,870,5.134751773049645

5542295,5,B00B18FA50,"Having lived in London and being in awe of Selfridge's department store, this was a throughly entertaining tale of the beginnings of the shopping institution that transformed the retail industry.  The man inspired loyalty, creativity and entrepreneurship, something more of today's corporate leaders should aspire to do.  Jeremy Piven was perfect in the starring role, at balancing Selfridge's confident bravado with his unsure vulnerability.  Spoiler alert: Its just a shame that he sacrificed family happiness.  Maybe that will be remedied in Season 2  (we start watching that tonight).  Very riveting show.",1463011200,,609,5.637362637362638

It drives me crazy and it takes me out of the story, which I think is good.  So it's a disappointment.  It's one of the many things that worked so well with Downton Abbey, the use of period language in a true period piece.  You would never hear anyone say,""Hi Mom.

5542429,3,B00B18FA50,"My biggest complaint about this series is the casting. Although I am not a fan of Jeremy Piven, I suppose he's well-cast as the brazen, overly-confident American titular character, traits that seem to come naturally to this actor. It's really a lot of the other casting that I find so weak-to-downright wrong. The actresses cast to play Ellen Love (a ""star of the first magnitude"" of her day) and ""Lady Mae"" are so utterly unconvincing as to be a major distraction; nothing is right about them physically or acting-wise. Very amateurish, really. And some of the scenes are wincingly contrived. I'm not sure I will be following any more of this series.",1461974400,,651,4.821428571428571

5542459,5,B00B18FA50,"My mom suggested watching Selfridge since Downton was over. All I knew was that it was faster paced. Upon watching the first episode, I didn't care so much for it being that it was definitely faster paced when compared to Downton Abbey and Piven seemed so silly in it. He first portrays Selfridge as an extremely upbeat man, nearly goofy, and it's tough to relate to him. All the period shows tend to make Americans look silly and careless and Piven definitely didn't away from that. Closer to the end of the first show, it's more  understood why he is this way since he has a store to open and it's quite different than the shops England is used to when normally ladies maids do the shopping. He wanted people to be excited and to trust him without seeing fear in his eyes. He knew that as long as he kept that appearance, people would stay confident that the store would catch on. The first few episodes don't dive deeply into each character really and instead it takes a little longer to see Selfridge's real feelings and a few background stories of the characters which is explained through conversations. The story immediately dives into his womanizing ways which had me see him as the bad guy right off. It didn't explain why he was like that until later. I'm not sure why that was done and not the other way around where his pat is shown. By the last two or three shows left of the season, you're wanting more and ready for season two. Though before the end of the season, I got used to the pace of the season. All the period shows I've watched were slower in pace. This one is exciting. Each character has a story and background and with them taking you to their houses, the store, the streets, cafes, and so on to keep the show going. Downton mainly stayed within the house with a few scenes elsewhere and it seemed like they couldn't figure out what else to do with the characters based around the house by season 3. Selfridge has so many characters with several stories, new problems linking to the old and characters also connect stories which makes you want more.",1461715200,2,2076,4.463157894736842

It was so bad it gave me a headache.
I made it through maybe half of the first episode and gave up.
The words I saw others use describing Jeremy's inability to act bear repeating: horrible, robotic, forced, wooden, contrived.
Something is off with the script. Some sentences or exclamations are right out of today's vocabulary and will make you wince.
Plenty of bad reviews from professionals about this series as well - most highlighting how Piven was miscast.
If you want to see charisma and good acting watch 'The Paradise'.",1461715200,2,608,4.745283018867925

5542706,5,B00B18FA50,"Here we go again, this time courtesy of ITV in a sweeping tale that is as elegant a soap opera as you can find. The Brits should take a patent on their period costume dramas. The beauty of these productions is the fact that the company of actors that make up the British theatre establishment as time to inhabit their characters and bring us the viewers along as family. I expect the actors themselves are cheerfully done with their alter egos, all the more the play at the heights of their acting powers. To those who have seen THE PALACE the derivative nature of the birth and growth a great department store is a vehicle that works well surrounded by the human and political intrigue.  Jeremy Piven shows again how much better the Brits are at playing Americans than vice-versa, and not just the accent, but the character. Frances O'Connor as Mrs. Selfridge commands many of the episodes as her character evolves. A great occasion for the total immersion of binging or stretching out the episodes with always something to look forward to.",1459209600,,1041,4.688524590163935

At first, I didn't care for the lead character playing Mr .Selfridge because I thought his acting seemed forced.  Stay with it the sub-plots are great in the first season and by the second season I was cheering for Mr. Selfridge.  His character, as well as the others, really grew throughout the series and he seemed much more comfortable and natural in his role of Mr. Selfridge. Season 2 and 3 just get better!  I am waiting for Amazon Prime to pick up Season 4 because I hate paying for a membership and then also paying for new seasons!!  Amazon Prime??

I feel like a better name for the series would be Selfridges's instead of mr selfridge, because with the latter it makes you think that it's only about harry selfridge.",1455580800,,610,4.554545454545455

It's hard to watch without thinking of The Paradise...young man with big dreams and an unorthodox approach to department stores, shopping, fashion and advertising... young woman with ideas and a point of view, unheard of at the time. It's basically the same show except The Paradise was actually good! While I do think Jeremy Piven is a good actor, he was inappropriately cast in this show. He seems more like Ari Gold, than a rising business man of the 1920's.",1452211200,,578,4.732673267326732

5543455,5,B00B18FA50,"I LOVE this series. While Mr. Selfridge cannot take credit for inventing the modern department store, he WAS responsible for introducing an American style department store to London. He introduced window displays and the concept of merchandise on display throughout the store. Unlike the stodgy British retailers at the time, he invited customers to look, to imagine, to browse, and to feel and handle the merchandise.

In the days before television, video games, the internet and all of the technological advantages that we take for granted today, Mr. Selfridge understood the value of showmanship. His department store including an auditorium for guest speakers. He sensationalized many of the important events of the period such as having the first man to fly across the English channel appear in his store. He had world renown Freda Whittaker skate on a roof-top rink. He had Wimbledon champion Suzanne Lenglen demonstrate her serve on a rooftop court.

To battle the aroma of horse manure which was an unfortunate reality of the time, he put a cosmetics counter in the front of his store. Not only did he help pioneer selling cosmetics to ladies but by having the cosmetics counter in the front of the story, the sprayed perfume helped to mask the odor of the horse manure that some customers inadvertently brought in from having walked in the city streets.

Mr. Selfridge was a great lover of gadgets. He sold telephones, refrigerators, and ice making machines. He demonstrated the first television sets in London back in 1925. He enticed so many people to his store through lectures, theatrics, demonstrations, displays, sales events, food service, and other attractions that at one point he was able to proudly boast that Selfridge's was the THIRD largest tourist attraction in London after Buckingham Palace and the Tower.

Watching this series is like having a window into time.",1449100800,5,1888,5.100323624595469

It's hard to find a television show anymore that keeps you intently wanting more...  I can't wait for season 4!  So excited that Lady Moxely will be rejoining.  Good tv is hard to find, and it seems PBS anymore puts out some of the best television I have seen in a while.  Jeremy Pivens is a superb actor!  ",1448409600,,410,4.373333333333333

5543532,5,B00B18FA50,"I have watched seasons 1, 2 and 3, with 3 being the best so far.  I had to wait a long time for 3 to finally come to prime.  I noticed that Prime had seasons 1 and 2  but I just noticed they added season 3  as I am just now seeing it.  I just watched season 3 from start to finish all in one sitting.  Who doesn't love this series?  Its some of the best stuff on TV.  Nothing is gong to beat Jeremy Pivin as Aury Gold in Entourage, but he comes close as Mr. Selfridge.  Part of what makes Mr. Selfridge so good is that PBS hit shows always have such high production values as all the real locations, locations sets and  scenery are so lush looking and convincing on top of being filmed in very clear HD.  I am also impressed that they are so well written, perfectly casted and acted.  A lot of theater movies don't  even come this close.  .  .

btw, the fact that someone left a bad 1 star review for Mr. Selfridge proves that trolls are real..  WHY do you people waste your  time?",1448409600,,981,3.994818652849741

5543541,1,B00B18FA50,"The writing, directing, and low quality cinematography are the worst parts of this show. Though I like Piven, his performance is nothing short of awkward. Here's an experiment for you, watch the first four episodes of season 1 of Boardwalk Empire, then watch the first four episodes of Mr. Selfridge. They portray the same era in different settings, you will observe the subtleties and richness in the acting and cinematography in Boardwalk Empire and cringe at the awkwardness that is ""Mr. Selfridge"" in comparison. In an era where Scandal is the #1 prime tv show, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that ""Mr. Selfridge"" is getting ~4.6 stars on Amazon.  Further, the reasons I enjoy Boardwalk Empire and Downton Abbey are the same reasons I dislike Mr. Selfridge so much.",1448323200,,771,4.930769230769231

I found it unfortunate that Jeremy Piven's forced energy and affected smile gives the Selfridge character, one of history's greatest retail pioneers, a note of phoniness.

It has given me an opportunity to catch-up with some programs and to find ones I haven't seen before. I was looking for something different. Mr. Selfridge is based on Selfridge Department Store in London. The idea of a department store that let shoppers handle merchandise was foriegn to Londoners and considered outrageous by shop owners.  Mr. Selfridge just by being in London and challenging the good citizens, is of course appalling. Slowly he works his way into their society. The ups and downs of starting a business anywhere is difficult, but moving his entire family proves to be another challenge. Near bankruptcy when his mother, wife, three daughters, and son arrive, he is given their much needed support to press on. Masterpiece Theatre has another wonderful program for all to enjoy and leaves us wanting more....",1444262400,,926,4.974193548387097

5543818,5,B00B18FA50,"The casting is what clinched this series for me.  Jeremy Piven is a pip of an actor. His performance, for me, is riveting, as is that of the people in all the other rolls, not in the least Frances O'Connor, who may just be the gentlest, most beautiful woman in the world.  I can only assume that, because it's PBS, the history is pretty accurate, too.  I probably wouldn't even care is some of its bits were fiction, the sets and costuming, and the snappy dialogue, being so well done.",1444176000,,485,4.366666666666666

I doubt that the expressions "" I don't mean to sound cheesy"" existed (ep. 2), nor did ""I don't want anyone hanging around"" (ep. 1); and at least, not in that context. Piven acts well- too act-y, can't shake the modern day american affect he has- a little too smarmy in my opinion. Not sure about the casting.",1444003200,,431,4.6103896103896105

5543839,5,B00B18FA50,I love it!!! It is like watching a really good romance novel which is based on the life of a real man. The lead actors are fantastic and talented. The costumes and scenery/props are magnificent. The minor characters/actors are as interesting as the primary ones and they are equally as talented. It is easy to lose yourself in the historical step back. I could never wait until the next episode.,1443657600,,395,4.6571428571428575

The only thing that would make it better is to somehow have Adrian Grenier show up as a British guy named Vincent Chase. i mean, would that blow your mind? Anyway, this is a fascinating historical story, with well developed characters, storylines that twine and intertwine so mesmerizingly.

However, I am cheering for the Selfridge family, and very eager to watch this drama to the end--so long as it stays out of the muck and mire which caused me to abandon Downton Abbey.",1441497600,,477,4.348314606741573

Wives support the ventures of their husbands.  I won't be watching the rest of this series.

5544108,3,B00B18FA50,Extremely disappointed I spent $20 which probably is not a lot of money to most people but when you are living from month-to-month it is a lot of money.  We as consumers should be able to view at least a couple episodes to see if it's something that we want to buy.  As far is this show goes season one and two were free with prime and then of course it leaves you wanting to know what happens when Rose dies.  Not a really good ending to the story if indeed it is the end.  What happened to the other characters?  I think it was overpriced I will not be buying any more movies for quite some time very very disappointed.,1439596800,,621,4.099173553719008

5544189,5,B00B18FA50,"Jeremy Piven is one of those Hollywood actors that doesn't get the respect he deserves, even though he was fantastic on Entourage, Keeping Up with the Steins, and The Goods. Casting him as Mr. Selfridge was a brilliant move, because the historical figure and Piven are very much the same, bigger than life people full of self-confidence and gravitas. You can't help but pay attention to Piven, and no, he isn't reprising his Ari Gold role, Ari Gold was a loudmouth that treated people like crap (sometimes). Mr. Selfridge may be an unfaithful husband with a gambling vice, but he is a fantastic boss, motivator, and father.  He is reckless because he's a risk-seeker, but then again, no guts, no glory.

This series has been great so far, I only wish they would focus on the merchandising and running of the store more, but I understand, Mad Men isn't solely about advertising and The Walking Dead isn't solely about killing zombies.",1438473600,5,933,4.788819875776397

5544264,5,B00B18FA50,"There just are not enough words to express how hooked I became after watching ten minutes of the first episode. Notwithstanding I think Jeremy Piven is a good actor and totally hot, the story is based on real-life and uses that as an excuse to whisk us on a magic carpet ride to before the turn of the last century to watch the antics and drama of the guy that invented department stores as we know them today.",1437436800,,410,4.269230769230769

5544280,4,B00B18FA50,"Despite the fact that Jeremy Piven totally over-acts his role, I am thoroughly enjoying the series.  I had no idea about this piece of history.  I know it is simply ""based on a true story"", but it's very interesting to see how an American made such a name for himself as a ""shopkeeper"" in England during that time period.",1437436800,,321,4.423728813559322
5544281,4,B00B18FA50,"If you're a Downton Abbey fan looking for something to whet your appetite for period drama, watch Mr. Selfridge. While it's not quite Downton status good, it's certainly in the ball park.

The Titular character is SUCH a mixed bag, but you find yourself enamored with his idealistic outer persona while he struggles with his demons. His wife and workers, in my opinion, are the real shining stars of the first season, character-wise. Their comings of age mirror that of the show, growing into itself with each episode.
Season one can feel a bit insincere and over-buffed at times, but near the middle-to-end portion, the show catches a great stride. Even if you end up lukewarm about this season, you can say you watched it for the sake of Season 2, which introduces and develops some excellent characters and arches, and is what will keep this show on my very short list of *must sees*",1437436800,,886,4.716129032258064

5544310,5,B00B18FA50,"This PBS series gave a relatively unknown American retailer an identity.  The actors were not particularly well known, but well cast and played their roles well.

The story of how an American literally took an untried way of serving customers in a less than perfect location is interesting and written well.

It is quality programs like this that continue to give PBS an edge over many competitors.

Highly recommended

Whether or not the story of the real Mr. Selfridge is embellished for the sake of television won't matter as it is a compelling show very much worth watching.

We live in Chicago, so it's particularly fun to watch how State Street's Marshall Fields department store's concept was transported and changed into a beautiful London retailer. The cinematography is excellent and the interior designs are splendid. The fashions are wonderful to see but perhaps the scandals are even more fun to watch? Ha!

5544437,2,B00B18FA50,"I was looking forward to watching this series because I watched the two seasons of The Paradise and loved it. But because the two shows were both period dramas and had similar storylines The Paradise was cancelled and Mr. Selfridge  continued on. I had high hopes for Mr. Selfridge because of how much I loved The Paradise and because of the reviews that I read, but I was actually disappointed. Yes, the time period is fun to watch, the costumes are amazing, sets wonderful, and casting pretty good but the storyline it just revolves around who is sleeping with who. There are no good moral characters in the leading roles. It's just a soap opera set in the early 1900s. It seems like writers these days can't get beyond sex to be original. Maybe the characters go on to make better, less selfish decisions later on in the series, I didn't finish watching the whole first season; I was just too discouraged and wanted characters with higher morals and an original storyline.",1435276800,,975,4.6686046511627906

5544445,5,B00B18FA50,"What a wonderful period television show. The story presented by the series lines up to the real story of Harry G. Selfridge and his founding of the Selfridges department store. The series also tells the story of Selfridge's life with his wife and family as well as many of his employees. Mr. Selfridge rates 5 stars along with Downton Abbey. Like Downton Abbey, the wonderful story lines keep viewers - this one included - coming back for more.

I highly recommend purchase all three seasons of this very entertaining and well done British (ITV) television series.

If only U.S. producers and television networks produced series that are as high quality as Mr. Selfridge. We can hope that they will do so someday in the not too distant future.

Season 1 is free for those of you who have subscribed to Amazon Prime. Watch it and you will become hooked on the series.",1435276800,,866,4.684210526315789

And while I enjoy shows that are wholesome, only a couple of scenes in one episode gets a bit distasteful, but they quickly do away with that and they never show scenes like that again. I watched the first and second season within a week, and was so sad when I couldn't continue on with season three, which is still being aired in America right now.

5544541,5,B00B18FA50,"Mr. Sefridge was a Yankee come to Great Britain to build a department store. This is about the early days.
  Before Selfridges, shopping wasn't fun. You knew what you wanted and bought it. You didn't ask questions or touch the goods first and browsing wasn't allowed. Selfridges made shopping an experience.
  This is about the man with a vision, his family, the people who came to work for him, his supporters, his detractors and his mistress. Just like Downton Abby, the supporting cast is every bit as interesting.
  Jeremy Piven is a terrific actor, and the cast around him is just as talented.
  The set dressing and fashions are amazing! The opulence of the Edwardian Era is well represented.

5544645,5,B00B18FA50,"We'd been binge-watching Downton Abbey until the later seasons were no longer offered free here. So we switched to Netflix and are waiting for discs. In the meantime we started Mr Selfridge because of the good reviews and we really like it. Same time periods for the two series, but Selfridge is Americanized & more comfortable because there isn't the class distinction as in DA, although there is plenty of archaic thinking and mores here. Well written, well acted, thoughtful. It really is a soap, though a good one. We'll be watching a couple episodes when there's nothing good on TV, it'll get later than we usually stay up, an episode will end and I'll ask my wife if she wants to watch one more, she always says yes, so we do.",1433030400,,732,4.553030303030303

5544680,5,B00B18FA50,We were looking for a new series to watch and came across Mr Selfridge with Jeremy Piven.  Piven has always been a favourite of ours so we thought we would give it a try.  We ended up watching three complete seasons in a matter of 5 days.  Guess it is safe to say we were hooked.  We are looking forward to season four.  The story line is constantly changing and evolving.......never a dull moment.,1432944000,,398,4.324324324324325

5544684,3,B00B18FA50,"This story is loosely based on real life events that happened around the turn of the century when Harry Selfridge was beginning the British leg of his department store marketing successes after achieving wealth first in America.
""Mr. Selfridge"" seems to somewhat mirror the story line of ""The Paradise"" which is also a PBS TV series about a department store but based on a novel written in 1883 by Emile Zola.
""The Paradise"" was cancelled after 2 seasons and the last of it was aired at the same time as the first of ""Mr Selfridge"". It's interesting that so many of the characters in The Paradise have almost exact counterparts in this series. I probably would have liked this better if I hadn't watched The Paradise first.
In my opinion, the characters in ""Mr. Selfridge"" aren't as well cast nor as appealing as those in ""The Paradise"".  I'm not sure I want to continue watching the full 3 seasons and follow a frenetic Mr. Selfridge whom I don't like as a character to begin with into his decline into poverty and self destroying behavior.
It's always fun to watch a period piece but Emile Zola made for a better story.",1432944000,,1121,4.605
5544685,5,B00B18FA50,Loved this series. The portrayal of this man is true to everything I have read. Can't wait for season three to come to Amazon Prime.,1432944000,,132,4.32
5544686,3,B00B18FA50,"I watched all episodes, all 3 seasons.  It started out great and slowly went downhill from there, especially Season 3.  Why?  Plot and character development.  For me,  the plot held mostly through Episode 2, although a great, wealthy family would have certainly been more involved than they seemed to be in the choice of the daughter's first husband.  It was as if they had no clue, highly improbable in a family of that social standing.  And there is the disconnect between the parents and children, both daughters and son.  The son was a lightweight, to be kind. He was very insecure,  very unlike his father, and very unlike the young man who had played the son in the first episode.  The daughters were stock characters as well.  Character development was very limited, unlike the characters in Downton Abbey.

In short, it was not believable to me and so when Episode 10 was finished I found myself glad to not be watching it any more.

For 6 months, in 1979, I worked in an office in the block behind Selfridges. I used to walk through the Store, for the sheer heck of, everyday. The show really captures what Selfridges used to be -- and in the late 60s there were still touches from the early days shown in the show. My two daughters (9 & 14) and my wife, all of who have yet to visit London, JUST LOVE this show. It admirably filled the void left by Downtown Abbey after we watched ALL the episodes on Amazon Prime.

This is a classic soap opera in the best sense and Jeremy Piven's over the top performance suits the larger than life legend of Harry Selfridge. Piven is supported by a wonderful ensemble of actors. You'll find characters and story lines that are compulsively watchable. The story line does take on the tragedy of the Word War I, but overall this is a lighthearted series.  If you love period sets and fashion this a lot of fun.",1430438400,,473,4.564705882352941

Lots of different textures and POV. Excellent supporting cast. Nod to Piven as Mr. Selfridge. Piven has the ability to showcase a dynamic range of emotions (26.2), all in just one episode. Supreme set and costume design. I do enjoy House of Cards, but it's good to know that there can be excellent, well written shows on TV that must have dark subject matter, (violence/murder/deceit) in order to keep the viewers attention.

I can't get enough of this show.  I am watching it all over for the third time and can hardly wait for the weekly PBS third season's program each week.  This show has made me crazy over history in department stores, Chicago, the families, dress styles, period dresses, etc.  I search the web while or after watching the show.  After reading the true story of Harry Selfridge, I do NOT want to see the downfall of this man on the show - AT ALL!  I will be severely disappointed if they rush into that phase of his life!  I don't want to see it.  My favorite season so far is season 2-with all the added color. Although I respect the writers, producers, directors, etc for trying to stick to the true story....

I was enjoying this so very much until I read an article written by Mr. Selfridge's granddaughter who points out that the story has been greatly embellished.  The affairs,  the neglect of his family,  did not take place.  I won't be a spoiler, but being a fan of ""historical"" shows, I am disappointed in a show that is touted as being biographical is actually half fiction.  Disappointed in that.  The set, story, acting, costumes, could still be wonderful without the embellishment; Mr. Selridge was a self-made man and there was much too admire.  Too bad the other had to be stuck in for ""shock?""  effect.  Not sure I will watch Season 2",1429228800,,731,4.714285714285714

5545249,5,B00B18FA50,Mr Selfridge on PBS is an addictive show to watch. I never knew much about the man or the history of department store marketing particularly to women. The series is interesting because of the evolving attitudes toward workers and unions and women becoming focused on their contributions outside the home.  The costuming is mesmerizing. All the actors & actresses are top flight.,1429228800,,378,5.096774193548387

5545636,5,B00B18FA50,"I got Amazon Prime mainly...well solely because I had seen a few episodes of season 1 last year of Mr. Selfridge. Last month I even watched the Netflix counterseries, The Paradise. But this was just stunning! I just finished season 2 and I am more than satisfied. My favorite episode is Season 2/ Episode 10. No spoilers from me. I have been a fan of PBS since I was about 5 years old and could watch what I wanted. After 45 years of Tv, this is one of my favorites. Now I'm off to see what other PBS Masterpiece series I can find. Enjoy!",1428192000,,538,4.1826923076923075

5545639,4,B00B18FA50,"Just started watching, hoping to fill a void left by Downton Abbey's season ending. So far Jeremy Piven is so delightful as Mr. Selfridge that he makes up for a slowish storyline.

5545653,4,B00B18FA50,"Not as good as Downtown Abbey, but good enough that we are watching the first two seasons. Mr. Selfridge is in a sense a caricature of what the British think of Americans, brash, foolhardy at times, always in a hurry, not respectful of position or traditions, and how that shakes up the world of London in the 1910's, so far before the First World War.",1428105600,,352,4.430769230769231
5545654,4,B00B18FA50,"Interesting plot with an American making his way in London and pushing the establishment (investors, bankers, government, etc) to move faster on things he wants done to promote his store.

5545657,3,B00B18FA50,"Deeply disappointed in 'Selfridge'. I care more about the window dressers than I do the main characters. Piven gleams bombastically, chronically; however, season three seems as if it's covering new, inventive territory - we'll see.
Conversely, 'The Paradise' (a similar theme) shines from every corner - literally and figuratively. Everything about it is lush, gracious, and often startling. Eamonn Elliot as Moray is a multi-dimensional character, constantly changing, always 'turned out' in the finest fashions of Paris. Love affairs and tragedies abound, within this pitch-perfect cast.
I often just listen to it -- the music has won highest honours.
All things being equal, I'd rather be at The Paradise.",1428105600,,708,5.504587155963303

I love seeing the time line unfold like a beautiful flower.  It is well written and has a great story line, it really is a 5 star in my book.",1428105600,,367,3.88

5545670,1,B00B18FA50,I was hoping that Mr. Selfridge would be a mirror image of the American experience of Downton Abbey.  It's really disappointing.  Downton Abbey goes to such lengths to be perfectly historical and this show just does not have the same feel.  I had such high hopes.  Comparing this show to Downton Abbey just doesn't even seem fair.  It's like comparing kindergarten to Harvard.  The story lines are so obvious and trite.  From the first show you know that Mr. Selfridge will be having an affair with the show girl.  I had such high hopes.,1428105600,,537,4.638297872340425

It's an interesting story, and I missed the first and second seasons on PBS, so it's great that I can see it from the beginning on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 I've been watching episodes while I'm on the treadmill and got so interested in wanting to see the next episodes, I watch one in bed at night too, before I go to sleep.",1428019200,,371,3.8947368421052633

5545692,3,B00B18FA50,"Costumes, staging and cinematography are wonderful. The direction feels a little ""over-the-top"" and cartoonish even though the acting is quite good. I'm only through the first 3 episodes of season 1 but I'm starting to get bored with Mr. Selfridges self-serving interests. I enjoyed the historical aspects of episode 1 and I love the 'evolution' of the psychology of ""shopping""!

The only weakness is the lead actor, Jeremy Piven.  He seems a bit superficial, not much depth in his acting.  However, since he plays the only American with a British cast, I will give him some slack in the first season.  Once I get caught up with all the shows I will revisit this review.  For now I highly recommend watching it, the end of each episode will have you on the edge of your seat wanting more!",1427932800,,536,4.484536082474227

5545749,5,B00B18FA50,"We are really enjoying this show!  We got into Downton Abbey a few months ago and obsessively watched all five seasons over several weeks.  When we finished it, we really missed that sort of show.  I love the time period and it's amazing to see these shows bring that time period to life with the beautiful costumes and all of the social ways of that time.  Season 1 starts off fairly poorly.  In the first few episodes the characters and plot are very flat.  I would say somewhere around episode 4 or 5, the show really hits its stride and becomes something very dynamic and entertaining.  We are really enjoying this very much.  I would say we like this about as much as we liked Downton Abbey, however this show is less stressful to watch!  It is more focused on the social dynamics than on dramatic events.  If you are a Downton Abbey fan I recommend that you give Mr. Selfridge a watch while you wait for the new DA season to start... and make sure you give it a chance at least until mid-way through Season 1.",1427760000,,1015,4.351063829787234

Characters are nicely defined, comfortably predictable, and most are generally likable. In the genre (IMO, Downton Abby is the standout), this fits nicely. And that genre is picking up steam, as those of us who are becoming sick and tired of violence as an entertainment medium, begin to appreciate such things as subtlety, nuance, and quality with the faithful reproduction of the period.",1427760000,,499,5.329113924050633

Such interesting and exciting characters, and some with a truth to them.  My only complaint is not with Amazon, but with the producers of the show.  Too many cast changes from season to season, and the abrupt death of Rose, with no on screen time between 'Harry, I'm dying"" and the funeral is very unsettling. I understand contracts and schedules, but please think about your audience.",1427673600,,547,4.561224489795919

5545846,5,B00B18FA50,"Jeremy Piven as Mr. Selfridge is so dynamic! The show itself is full of life and while I am a fan of Downton Abbey, Downton Abbey is rather staid compared to the lively characterizations and great dramatic plotlines of the characters who make up this world.  This series gives the American viewer an exciting look at England's past  via fashion & commerce that is much more fun to watch than the usual BBC period dramas. Can't wait to find out what the next big thing will be at Selfridges!  This is a first rate cast that continues to change, but the characters who do remain evolve more each season.  Jemery Piven portrays Mr. Selfridge as the perfect boss - for the minute or two he has to spend on you, he makes you feel like the most important person in the world . No wonder the real Selfridge inspired loyalty from his enormous staff.  This show in turns makes me laugh and cry. It has its villains and heroes, loves, hates and a gamut of emotions, but life at Selfridges is never dull.",1427328000,,993,4.404371584699454

Mr. Selfridge only wants more and more, using other peoples money, without realizing the wealth he already has. Nothing good ever happened to anyone who deserved it, very depressing.

5545920,4,B00B18FA50,"It's a show, alright. I found it to be rich in acting and full of talent, superior to other PBS productions. Frances O'Connor sort of  steals the show, too bad she has to die. I haven't read the book in which the series was inspired, instead I went to Wikipedia and revised a feeble description of this family, a content not comprehensive at all, it's not even an abstract. However, it gave me a disappointing appreciation of the series: Mr. Selfridge and his wife Rose don't even look close to the photographs shown in the encyclopedia. In a young Mr. Selfridge's photo, he displays bushy and robust sideburns, in a latter photo, he has a sophisticated wax moustache; it appears he never had a beard. Rose's appearance is miles from the Rose of the production.

As a child, I watched a movie that had Al Capone in it, the name of it does not matter, I've forgotten it. What was striking was the looks of Al Capone. At the time I did not know who he was, but years latter, in a magazine I saw a picture of him and could not believe the astonishing resemblance of the character.

Mr. Selfridge is a multimillion pound production and I would've respected it more if the characters looked more like the personalities they were representing. Good looking people does not have to replace the individuals the stories are about. It's like voting for a candidate because he looks presidential. How does a president have to look? What does looking presidential mean? The Country could be in better shape If citizens had voted for the ugly candidates.

This is the reason I'm giving 4 stars, the producers and director were more interested in a make-believe situation added to the already make-believe philosophy Mr. Selfridge had already running through his veins.",1427241600,,1755,4.706840390879479

It's still another British soap opera around the early 1900s, but covering a wider range of social classes. As Americans in London, the Selfridges bring a fresh perspective. The show is based loosely on a true story about a department store pioneer who revolutionized merchandising in the London scene. And the Mr Selfridge Series is much superior to The Paradise, also on PBS and also played in a British department store setting, but flat and boring to my taste.",1426982400,,587,4.821782178217822

First season set the tone and excitement for the continuing episodes.  The first two episodes were slow and not as brilliant. But, like a snowball rolling down a hill, the writers picked up the pace and brought forth a series worth watching giving us a full life adventure with more characters and story lines. .",1426896000,,453,4.7215189873417724

The beatiful art designs and apparel is exciting in themselves and played a huge part in the acceptance and success of this virgin season.

5546337,2,B00B18FA50,"I'm late to the show, but figured after other successes on PBS I wanted to give it a go.

My main question after watching Season 1, Episodes 1 & 2 is:  How could this actor possibly be the main character?  He's the ONLY reason I don't care to keep watching. He's so NOT acting, but shouting most of his lines. (Over, and over, I might add.) All the others actors/tresses seem suitable for their roles.  But again, how could casting make such a mistake w/this guy?  I don't get it.  He either needs to work at a circus act or be the main cast in a town's Little Theater, needing a guy to project a good ways back. Or maybe both. I'm still shaking my head over it.  Some of the one star reviewers help.  Would be so discouraged if no one else saw it.

One question:  Does Mr. Selfridge play the same part the same way all the way through? The answer to this might help me know whether to continue this series or not.

Thanks!",1426377600,,923,4.15819209039548

At first I wasn't overly impressed with Jeremy Piven as Mr. Selfridge, but the more I watched I think that has more to do with the character he is playing rather than his acting skills.  The early 20th Century has always interested me, this series is great because it really gives insight to several income/class levels.",1426118400,,376,4.449275362318841

5546446,5,B00B18FA50,This is an excellent historic period drama set in England around the time of WW1.  Mr. Selfridge is based on an American from the Chicago area who married a well to do American woman.  Mr Selfridge was able to rise from relative poverty to build the first and greatest department stores in London at the time.  The characters and the acting are all superb.  Looking forward to season 3.,1426118400,,386,4.550724637681159

Perhaps we should hate Mr. Selfridge for turning us into shopaholics, but this is a terrific series about the development and growth of a major department store in London at the dawn of the 20th century.  It might be a bit fanciful at time - Dr. Harry Selfridge really meet Churchill, Mabel Normand, Robert Scott, and all the other contemporary celebrities who make appearances in the show?  Whether or not he did, they make for a jolly good show.  The program also touches on contemporary issues - the women's suffrage movement in particular.

I appreciate the history of Selfridge's and how it changed the world, but prefer the Selfridges documentary on netflix to this (so far).

I prefer the more fantastical The Paradise, which, while not very realistic, hooked you into the characters immediately. I wish BBC would have made the third season of that!",1425686400,,475,4.511627906976744

I learned that the Paradise was canceled in order to keep Mr. Selfridge and I can not understand why anyone would waste their time with this show when they had the option of The Paradise. I actually could not sit through an entire episode of Mr. Selfridge it was so bad. Mr. Selfridge comes off as a loud arrogant swindler. In the very first episode he is shown to cheat & lie to his business partners, as well as, his own wife. This isn't entertainment, in my opinion, and I am not sure how this show gained such support over The Paradise.
In my opinion, Mr. Selfridge should be scrapped & The Paradise should be brought back as soon as possible!",1425513600,,668,4.352

5546941,2,B00B18FA50,"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Jeremy Priven fan. I've loved his work since the Gary Shandling show. I love his fast paced delivry, I love his bellicose balderdash, I love the way he over-emphasizes with body movements.. I just really LIKE the guy's acting. So I was CRUSHED almost immediately by this performance. Priven just isn't suited for the role of a turn of the last century ANYthing. It's like 'Saavy New Yorker gets caught in a time travel machine and lands in Victorian Europe'. At eight episodes into the first season, Priven seems to be in desperate need of a good diction coach and an intervention by 'Over-Actors Anonymous', though in all fairness the over-acting seems to be toning down somewhat, if not the terribly modern East Coast accent. That actress playing Mrs. Selfridge is very good, as is her love interest. The kids are pretty lackluster. The most interesting characters are to be found in the store, where the talent seems to be centered. The sets are really lush. The storyline is a little tedious in places and not very well thought out. For instance, most of us know about the women's movement of the time, but the writers didn't see fit to include any explanation of what was happening to women other than hinting at work inequality. So you find yourself caring a lot less than you would have with a little back story.

I'll watch more, but only because there are no more episodes of Outlanders to be seen. What can I say... Some like it Scot.",1425081600,,1486,4.586466165413534
5546942,4,B00B18FA50,Interesting but I had no idea the famous London store was started by an  American.  Not as good ad Downton Abbey but good if you like this sort of show.,1424995200,,152,4.033333333333333

5547549,3,B00B18FA50,"In comparing this series with one like Downton Abbey you may come away disappointed. This story by itself does hold interest for those that love this sort of period piece, but will disappoint those that are more shall we say ""romantic"" in nature that a period piece of this sort usually draws. Those that are big fans of drama like Downton Abbey love the period, but also fall in love with the characters and the relationships each has with one another. With the family at the heart of Downton it pulls the heartstrings and causes you to love each character.

In this series, Mr. Selfridge's family seems to take a backseat and as he rises in fame and fortune he feels the need for ""more exciting pleasure"" and what could have pulled us in and made us love this family and  character has us shaking our heads and  wondering if he knows what he is doing. We like our fantasies acted out on screen and for the most part our fantasy now would be a happy marriage, a happy family, and a successful business or fortune with which to care for that family and all whom they touch. We have grown tired of the immoralities of modern society, although we endure it and has it's heart wrenching realities.

Some characters will pull you into their life here, but only a couple and they are not the main characters.

The main actor is not the best lead I have seen and comes off fake most of the time.

The sets, costumes, and most actors were very good and that is what one may like best. The fact it is based on a true story, so they can not help in one way that you don't ""fall in love with the family"",  will peak your interest if you like this time period of history. I would rather they have taken ideas from this man's life and rewritten a drama that we would love like Downton Abbey---just my opinion. We will need another if Downton goes away and since we only get it once per year.....

So, you may watch this for period sake, but my guess is most ""romantics"" will not love it. If they make a season 2 with this I would doubt much more then that.....where is our next series like Downton?

So, bottom line (in my opinion) you can not compare the two because there is NO comparison.",1422403200,,2179,4.308068459657702
5547550,4,B00B18FA50,"I wanted a better understanding Edwardian London in the early 1900s for my research. I don't know much about Selfridge except that I visited the store in London, England. Selfridges is a grand London department store but I didn't know much about it's history. I am surprised that an American named Harry Gordon Selfridge founded the magnificent store on Oxford Street that is still in existence today.

The three disc set includes ten episodes about 45 minutes each. Emmy and Golden Globe winner Jeremy Piven plays the pivotal role of Harry Selfridge. Both Piven and Selfridge hail from Chicago where Selfridge began working at Marshall Fields, the Chicago institution of department stores. I never watched Entourage nor do I care too. As for Jeremy's acting abilities, I wonder why he hasn't been nominated for any awards for this performance.

The series' weakness stems in the writing aspect of the series. The series appears to be both a hybrid of truth and fiction. The story lines involve a wide cast of characters more like a soap opera.

The cast includes veteran British actors and actresses like Frances O'Connor playing long suffering wife, Rosalie. Kika Markham plays the wonderful supportive mother, Lois, to Harry. There are other actors listed in the credits but they run the credits so fast in the beginning and at the end. Coronation Street's Katherine Kelly is wonderful in her part as a society lady, Lady Mae, with an absentee husband. Tom Goodman-Hill who plays Mr. Grove does a fabulous job. Philippa Heywood (Brittas Empire) has a memorable part as Ms. Bunting. French actor, Gregory Fitoussi, plays Henry LeClare, the French window dresser. The other cast members have had long and distinguished careers in stage, film, and television. Zoe Tapper plays Ellen Love, an actress and Harry's mistress.

The behind the scenes featurette (about 25 minutes) brings about how the series came to life from an idea to casting and set. The art direction and costumes are Edwardian in style and substance. You feel like you're in the early 1900s. The producers spared no expense in creating the Selfridge store environments based on old documents. Even the cast is in awe of the production itself. You can't help but want to be on set.

Unfortunately, I don't care really to see the second or third season of the series. I purchased this DVD to understand Edwardian London Society and I'm quite satisfied but I'm not in love with the series enough to see seasons two, three, and more. It's an entertaining melodrama overall where Harry Selfridge comes to life.",1422403200,,2572,4.958236658932715

Did people in that time period really have such loose morals. Didn't enjoy the adultery of the main character. The young handsome violinist falling in love with Miss Mardle was laughable.

The characters are all interesting,  the magnificient architecture of the time is represented,  fashion is amazing.  You feel like you are living and breathing the lifestyle 100 years later and across the pond.  The show portrays an innovative,  ambitious yet flawed man who wasn't afraid to live.  In fact,  I envy his employees as he appeared to be an empowering  boss for the most part and gave them opportunities to succeed both personally and professionally.  I did a search on descendants; the family line is alive and well.  Some are pioneers as well in their own area of expertise.  Can't wait for Season 3 this Spring.",1419984000,,749,4.7578125

When you get right down to it though, there is no real drama or earthshaking social commentary, however, it is nonetheless enthralling. The characters, costumes, and sets keep it intriguing. I would have cast someone else in the role of Mr. Selfridge.  Somehow, and I can't really put a finger on it, he doesn't quite pull it off as intended. He has an annoying nasal quality to his voice that is distracting.

Overall I would still recommend this for its many qualities. It kept our attention enough to do a marathon-watch.",1419811200,,665,4.627118644067797

5547825,5,B00B18FA50,"I wish more program focused on honor and unity, as this program does. Honestly, I'm so polluted with the format of American television, that continually, as I watch this wonderful series, I wonder how they do it, how do they make loyalty, self sacrifice and truth such an entertaining thing to watch, when American television seems to believe the only thing we can enjoy is housewives fighting, reality stars whining, absolutely morally void and ever slimy low down other thing they can throw in. I guess it boils down to the decision makers having such a low opinion of us as Americans. Bravo to Master Piece Theater for giving us credit as human beings and producing programs that highlight what life can be and more often than not is.

If you take no joy in watching train wrecked relationships, big bang special effects, and socially corrupt behavior as if that's the height of entertainment, then try watching Mr. Selfridge, it's a breath of lavender amongst the cesspool of programing force fed to us by marketers and charlatans.",1419120000,,1035,4.8474576271186445

It was a really good series over all.  I never watched Entourage, but if you are a fan of it, you may like this show as well.

We are lucky enough to remember the great Washington DC dept stores like Woodward & Lothrop which were a pleasure to visit especially at Christmas.

This one is made well and you never get tired of the storyline, like you'd think you would on a show about a store.  The characters keep you involved and wanting to watch more.  Jeremy Piven does a great job in this series, but I have always loved his acting.  I have also loved Francis O'Connor and she, too, does a great job in this series.  Most of the other cast members, I'm not too familiar with, but they all come together to create a really well made series about Mr. Selfridge, the creator and owner of the first department store to open.  He changes how people see fashion and shopping all while dealing with other mishaps and stories on the side.  The series doesn't revolve around him, but a whole cast (very much like Downton Abbey--stories with every cast member).  If you love Downton Abbey, like I do, this is a must watch as well.",1416787200,,959,4.403409090909091

5548120,5,B00B18FA50,"Sheer delight.  Yes, it's a soap opera, but a classy one set in the days when department store customers were treated like royalty, and department stores were BEAUTIFUL.  The background music really sets off the rather light, whimsical plot incredibly well, and the actors really are consummate professionals - engaging and over-the-top (but not too) pure Broadway types.  The plot is really cute: It's like Peyton Place meets a turn-of-the(last)-century London fancy department store - in a GOOD WAY.  Beware though - once you watch this, you will really NOT want to step foot in one of those drab, warehouse box stores ever again and you will find yourself yearning for the days when those who designed department stores had (sorry to say) MUCH more cultivated tastes.  You won't ever go back to  a dreaded/drab Wal-Mart at the very least.  The actor who plays Mr. Selfridge has an incredible grasp of the character and really should be commended.",1416700800,,949,4.968354430379747

5548137,5,B00B18FA50,I LOVE this show... very well done.  The storylines are compelling the acting is really quality.  It's addicting and this is coming from someone who didn't stick with Downton Abbey.  It's got a continuous narrative that follows the story of the main characters life without too many deviations into the other characters.  There's enough of the other storylines to make you care about the persons in main characters life but they consistently return to Mr. Selfridge.  I like that.  I don't like when you go off for half a season on every minor character's story.,1416441600,,562,4.863157894736842

I also enjoy their clothing and hats, it is fun to see how much improvement has been made on items as we have advanced how they work.  I also enjoy seeing the days when clerks in a store actually waited on their customers and gave them help. That is sorely missing today. This is about the upper class people, but they have many of the same issues we do in our lives, I get to know the characters so well and miss them when it is over.",1412812800,,536,3.962962962962963

Nothing came close. Then I got an email from Prime with a suggestion from what 'they' noticed we watched. We loved Jeremy Piven in Entourage so we were excited to give it a try. We LOVE It! It has all the petty little things going on among the various 'levels' of characters, and man, does it move along quickly. But it never seems like the stories are pushed. Very natural, but definitely moves the stories along. Outstanding. And yes, Piven is PERFECT for this part. And it's easy to care about all the other characters. As always, great writing, great characterization, great plots.",1412121600,,749,4.681818181818182

5548405,3,B00B18FA50,"After finishing ""The Paradise,"" I wanted to see the show that got renewed when ""The Paradise"" did not. After seeing this show, I think I prefer the other. Still, it's interesting enough to keep me watching. However, I'm not sure what all the complaints are about concerning Jeremy Piven. I think he's well suited for the role and plays it well (he plays an American, and therefore should not have a British accent).

That said, I find it difficult to find many other sympathetic characters in the show. Almost all of the women on this show are completely irrational and I'll just say it: stupid. Even for this time period. I'm not sure if it's the writing, the bad acting or just the way the characters were created, but it's disheartening to find a cast of women (except Agnes) so irritating. Mrs. Selfridge especially. She's so distractingly TERRIBLE at the end of this season and the next. Mr. Selfridge cheats on her, and I still find myself siding with him. What an AWFUL character--PLEASE get rid of her.

If you can get past the bad acting, the anachronisms and the believability of the behavior/costumes/dialogue of the show, then I'd say okay, go ahead. It's interesting and entertaining, so long as you don't mind the parade of annoying, miserable rich women complaining on the sidelines.",1411862400,,1298,4.790178571428571

I remember that we preferrred Selfridge's to Harrod's- the other department store that was in Knightsbridge. That was the Queen's shopping choice over Selfridge's. We really enjoyed watching Jeremy Piven put a face to the man, and we look forward to following the series as it progresses.

5548514,5,B00B18FA50,A friend recommended this series a while ago as we both like British drama. I'd seen it advertised and I didn't think I'd like it but I have to admit I was wrong!  Jeremy Piven is excellent as the larger than life American entrepreneur. He made Selfridge a very likable character in spite of his womanizing and gambling etc. The rest of the cast is impressive too. The sets and the costumes are stunning. A lot of hard work went into this production. The series begins with the grand opening of Selfridge's in 1909. There is a big cast of characters who all have a story. By the time the season ended it felt like they were all old friends. I was hooked!,1410393600,,654,4.317073170731708

5548528,5,B00B18FA50,I very much enjoyed season 1.  The setting and costumes took me straight to the early 1900s.  Every character was beautifully cast and perfect for their role. It was refreshing to watch a show that was not filled with sex and. violence ... Where the story took center stage. Jeremy Pivens was fantastic - his facial expressions conveyed so much emotion.  And Frances O'Connor was delightful!,1410393600,,391,4.893939393939394

My wife and I both learned a lot about the Department Store Retail Business and didn't realize that it had originated so long ago. The real Mr. Selfridge was an innovator and one who was willing to follow his instincts. We learned from other internet sources that sadly, he died in poverty.  Jeremy Piven's portrayal of Mr. Selfridge seems spot-on, and if he hasn't already, Mr. Piven should have won recognition and awards for his performance. We look forward to viewing the remaining episodes of Season One. Then it will be off to catch Season Two in the coming months.

5548605,5,B00B18FA50,I really like this series because it gives you a look into the past as to how the big department stores got started.  It is also interesting how people thought about displaying women's make-up and toiletries.  Their big beautiful windows are sadly missed as we don't have many of those anymore because of all the malls.  I remember when I was young we used to go to see the Christmas displays at Famous-Barr and Dillards.  It was all so fascinating and beautiful.,1409270400,,463,4.609756097560975

However, there is something about imported works (and perhaps that's not the key variable) that lends itself to a strange, mildly jerky rendition on my screen -- almost like the frame rates are not in synch.  Could this be the difference between NTSC (US standard) and PAL (much of EU standard?).  Have seen it before with excellent British series such as ""Luther"".

I became a Jeremy Piven fan in the late '90s when he was popping up as a sidekick or a best friend in shows and movies.  In this production, he slightly disappointed me.  The lilt of his voice was so repetitive that his personality became a little tiresome.  Since I don't know much about the real Harry Selfridge, I wonder if it was  a part of his character.  I was wishing for the ""real"" personality, and fire that the Selfridge must have had, to do what he did.

I would recommend, though.  This era in history is fascinating and fun.",1408233600,,597,4.363636363636363

We pay premium rates for Amazon Prime and when we choose to watch a show that is advertised as included in our membership, we do not expect that the first season will be just a ""teaser"" season.

What I found amazing (coming from the UK and having been to Selfridges on a number of occasions) was the fact that he introduced so many innovations.  It really was  case of the American showing the Brits how it should be done as many of these practices are now common.

Overall, it was well written and well acted.

Everytime I skimmed through the Amazon Prime videos I would pause on Mr. Selfridge;  scroll through it and move on with a ho-hum attitude after all Downton Abbey it was not. I promised myself I would keep it in reserve for when there was nothing else that tickled my fancy. Well that time came around the night before last...and was I ever wrong. I ventured into the mercantile world of Mr. Selfridge expecting a lullaby but by 0300 I was on my sixth episode and convincing myself to finish number seven after all I only needed three hours sleep. Well I have now completed the first season and will continue on through the second. Mr. Selfridge has exceeded my expectations and frankly I prefer it at this point to Downton Abbey. Everything works for this series; the writing is creative and true to the idioms of the period, the costume and set designs are accurate right down to the accessories; even the body language is within period. The  characters are multidimensional and unpredictable; the minute you have pegged one as a ""baddie"" the next minute you are crying with them.  I like a film that is totally immersive...and Mr. Selfridge is just that.",1407369600,,1196,4.658767772511848

My husband and I both thought it was a great show, but since PBS didn't repeat the remainder of Season 1 we ended up purchasing it .  I've read other reviews and it seems that some people love Jeremy Piven in the lead role and other people hate him.  We think he's a great actor and perfect for the role of Harry Selfridge.  We had only seen him as a supporting actor in various movies previously, and it was refreshing to seem him shine as the star of the show.  Mr. Selfridge is a wonderful timepiece with great costumes, characters, sets, and acting.  I think entrepreneurs and people who enjoy other timepieces such as Downton Abbey and Pride and Prejudice will also enjoy Mr. Selfridge.",1406678400,,821,4.44

5548878,5,B00B18FA50,"If you love costume dramas, you'll love this. What a great story. I wonder why no one has done this before. It's such a fascinating history of the store on Oxford Street. I have shopped Selfridges in London and never realized the true history of the store. All the innovations introduced by a cheeky American. I am sure he took London by storm. This is Masterpiece Theater at it's very best. A well rounded story about all the people around Selfridge and the man himself. You can follow the story of the lowly shop girl up to the owner to the stuffy bankers and the upper class. The series takes you back a hundred years to just before World War I. The costumes, the props, the hair styles, the language, etc. Everything seems perfect. You can loose yourself in the world of Edwardian London. Selfridge was a man living life very large, but very flawed.",1406505600,,853,4.509677419354839

5548911,3,B00B18FA50,"We were looking for a show and like historical drama's. This seemed like a reasonable chocie and it is. It is loosely based on the life of Harold Selfridge, a department store pioneer and tycoon. He's also an American trying hard to fit into British Edwardian era society. Different story lines are built from this theme-viewers get a peek at the lives of store clerks, affluent shoppers and a host of gamblers, artists and showgirls who populate this world. Major political themes of the time are interwoven into each episode such as women's sufferage,and wealth and clas disparities. Famous individuals of the age (Shackleton, Pavlova, Conan Dolye)  also make appearances.
The acting is very good except Jeremy Piven who is stiff in the role.",1406246400,,744,5.0
5548912,5,B00B18FA50,I didn't care for this show when I watched it on TV. Somehow Jeremy Pivens seemed not the right person for Mr Selfridge. It just seemed to me that the role didn't suit him and that he wasn't very comfortable in the part. However I did watch this season on PBS and then the previous seasons on Acorn or amazon. I still didn't feel comfortable with Pivens in that role but I love the performance of the other actors who make up the world o Selfridge.,1406160000,,448,4.22093023255814

This marvelous series starring the wonderful, surprising Jeremy Piven is not to be missed.
The juxtaposition of the audacious American Mr. Selfridge and the buttoned-down London Victorians who people his store is endlessly entertaining, and there is sorrow, suffering and pathos here as well.
Can't get enough of it!

No real emotion in his delivery whatsoever. I know the real-life character he's portraying was a ""large personality"", but I get no personality at all from this character. I was hoping this series would be as good as The Paradise, whose Mr. Moray character was believable and likable in spite of his flaws, but Selfridge and most of the peripheral characters here are like watching a cartoon.

* non-typical subject matter - the dramatized story of the UK's first department store ... you won't find this anywhere else
* story over shock - the script is focused on the relationships and dialog, as opposed to the risque'

I am looking forward to watching more.",1404691200,,492,4.579545454545454

It is based on the real Mr. Selfridge that opened the first department store in London on Oxford Street. He had some vision and had awesome ideas about retailing.

I love the whole premise of the show and each of the characters. Selfridge shows you what determination and  a positive attitude can create. Of course showing his faults and everyone else's gives you the drama.",1404432000,,331,4.516666666666667
5549106,4,B00B18FA50,"Jeremy Pivens is very ""American"" and rather stilted, but the other actors are quite MAGNIFICENT.  The clothing and attention to detail is admirable. NetFlix has The Paradise, and it's a better overall production.",1404345600,,212,5.424242424242424

5549108,5,B00B18FA50,"I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons of Mr. Selfridge on PBS and now I am re-watching the first season with a friend who missed it on PBS. This is a well done show and the actors are all well chosen for their parts. My only minor complaint is that Jeremy Piven is a little too enthusiastic as Harry Selfridge in the first season, but he still does a good job (better in season 2). While the show is based on the real store and its founder, much of the show is fiction as are most of the characters. However, the innovations that Harry brings to retail are very true and you will be amazed and amused in the first few episodes by the horror expressed by the store employees at Harry's innovations (put the merchandise out where shoppers can see and touch it? Oh the humanity!). The story follows several of the employees' lives so you get a feel for both the upper and lower classes in early 20th century London. Think of it as a city version of Downton Abbey. It also shows the challenges of being American and trying to break into London high society - as a mere merchant as well as a crude American! I'm glad there will be a season 3. Enjoy the show!",1404345600,,1149,4.275229357798165

5549132,5,B00B18FA50,This show is all about how visionaries have always thought. Always one step ahead of the competition and always having their ears and eyes open for what makes things happen and what sparks imagination not only in themselves but in others. The show has highs and lows of running a business and also of how to treat employees through trust and by example. It's a very entertaining show and it also has a little bit of history embedded in some of the episodes. I highly recommend the show if you like to watch history pieces. This show has a little bit of every thing and it is set in a high paced environment which keeps me from getting bored. Luckily I get to watch it on PBS where there are no commercials.

Romance and failed loves aplenty (as are most of these types of dramas), and it's got a real Upstairs/Downstairs feel between the people who work in Selfridges and the people who have money invested in it. It grew on me, but really had to just ignore Piven.",1404086400,,352,4.515625

I like the historical connection however I just can't believe the main character.  His acting is an extension of Entourage.

Mr. Selfridge shows many sides from paternal betrayal in his boyhood memories, to self-centered womanizer to at times kind and understanding to especially his children, but also employees.  A real innovator in business, he builds a high class department store in London and as each success abounds proves everyone wrong.  He hires very talented people for the top jobs and befriends people who will provide a network of the best contacts for him.

5549215,4,B00B18FA50,Fun show. Jeremy Piven dies a great job playing a charismatic American business man in London. Like many shows coming out of the UK the dialog and acting make the show interesting and compelling.

Just something missing. And the something missing is a good main actor.",1403136000,,340,4.683333333333334

The story line is okay, the supporting cast is quite good but Jeremy Piven and the woman who plays his wife are embarrassingly bad.  I will probably watch it all since I have started it (maybe it will get better) but I'd stick with Downton or Call The Midwife....much better.",1403049600,,340,4.844827586206897

Having watched a BBC production of ""The Paradise"" first.....which I HIGHLY, HIGHLY,  RECOMMEND....Mr. Selfridge comes in at second place....but still worth your time.  If you can get past the main character, Mr. Selfridge, (who over acts)  you will really enjoy this series.  The surrounding cast is AMAZING.

The story has a soap opera quality and enough historic detail to keep it interesting.  It is certainly a very different story from Downton Abbey.  We find ourselves watching 2 episodes every night because we are so drawn into the lives of each character.",1403049600,,409,4.5

I like that some problems don't last for multiple episodes but rather are solved before the hour is over!! I can't help but want the best for Mr. Selfridge, even though his decisions in his personal life will be his undoing. You see his struggle and continue to hope he comes out on top. Likeable character. The other story lines within the story are very entertaining as well. There are some characters that I love seeing as much as Mr. Selfridge.",1403049600,,535,4.583333333333333

5549276,4,B00B18FA50,Show is very well staged and acted.  The actual story lines would be more interesting if they were not so familiar.  The boss's infidelity is soapy.  The waiter Victor is the most admirable character followed closely by Miss Towler.

Brave young men march into battle with romantic notions of heroism on the field of honor and then face the carnage of the battlefield.  Women fill the vacant positions, learning that the work is hard but can also be satisfying, as supporting themselves earns them a new independence.

This is based on a true story, yes there was a department store called Selfridges, this man really broke to mold os stuffy shopping back in the day. We would not have realized it but our ancestors would go to a shop and have to know exactly what they wanted, color size etc.
The clerk then would only bring that item out and god for bid if you asked them to bring out a wide variety of things. The shopping as we know it today was not at all like it  was when our great grandmothers went shopping.
This series has adultery, drama, passion and the actor that plays Mr Selfridge is great in this role. So be prepared to grab a nice drink and some snacks, My husband and I watched all of the episodes back to back.
Enjoy and I hope my review helped you decide to watch this wonderful series.",1402099200,,868,4.105882352941176

I am still in season 1 but am so looking forward to more. An American family comes to London to start up a grand store unlike any other there. Mr. Selfridge has vast ideas, lots of guts & loves his women! Tune in to see wonderful stories, great ideas that we now take for granted, secrets of business behind closed doors & wonderful clothing of that period. Enjoy!",1402012800,,507,4.404255319148936

The rest of the cast are excellent as well (and all of them are very attractive). But with Piven, he has this ability to show the ""inner mind"" of his character just the most subtle of facial expressions. In an instant, I know how his character feels... and what a complex man Mr. Selfridge is.

The Paradise has quite a few virtuous characters, but this one is quite despicable after a while. Infidelity and lack of morals run rampant through this series. I personally don't believe that to make a series successful you have to have everyone sleeping around. That's why the old classics will remain classics forever and this will not. This truly has a soap opera feel.  I'm very disappointed and I will not be watching Season 2.",1401926400,,539,4.858695652173913

He was a self-made man who became quite a wealthy business man creating a unique concept, for the time, in shopping style.  But, this man had a weakness, women!  He ended his ""real life"" destitute.  The real life story is sometimes more fascinating.

The British series does a wonderful job in capturing the flavor of the 1910 period!  The adaptation of the story is fascinating and quite enjoyable.  I highly recommend it...so, give it a go!",1401926400,,563,4.914893617021277

5549380,1,B00B18FA50,"20% awesome 80% FILTH! This period drama is sick. It shows an American moving to Britian and starting a store. He lusts for business, money, adultery, gambling, smoking and sometimes drinking. All the women in the show are sleeping around. One particular character cheats on a dying woman's husband for 12 years only to be slighted by him and then goes around sleeping with other men. Rich women try and get into the pants of much younger men who oblige! One of the main stars of the show who acts responsibly and modestly for the first few episodes jumps into the bed of a coworker. I'm almost positive that chastity and virtue were much much more important and valued that this show would have you believe.

The funniest line in the whole show was the last episode when Mr. selfridge clears his bad name and says, ""I am an honorable man"" and all the characters believe him. Since when has a man become honorable by committing adultery multiple times while his good wife and kids are home asleep? What about men who are highly addicted to gambling, who blame everything on their dad, who lust for money and wealth and prioritize them over family?

If you like accurate period drama without a filthy soap opera story line, you are much much better off watching the Paradise. Or North and South.",1401840000,17,1294,4.621739130434783
5549381,5,B00B18FA50,"My family has a regular (?) family movie night at which we watch movies or series. I had watched this series from the beginning when it was first broadcast, but only recorded the series on my TiVo from Episode 5 forward. (It was a slow starter for me.) This year, my family wanted to watch, and I found myself without the first 4 episodes. Found these on Amazon, which was very good, as PBS series are usually only available on PBS, or when you buy the DVD set from PBS. So I was glad to find these. I have become a fan of the series, though it is not the equivalent of Downton Abbey.

We know there is a difference in audience tastes between the US and the UK, and I noticed at least one scene in this first UK version that I don't recall from the US version - a scene where Agnes Towler (because she's lost her job for helping Mr. Selfridge) is shown scrubbing floors, as it is the only work she can get.

But there are some that are quite wooden as well. I've only been able to get through 3 episodes. The history of Selfridge's is interesting, and I was really looking forward to seeing that explored.

5549402,5,B00B18FA50,Mr Selfridge is well worth the money. BBC shows on PBS are excellent. Mr Selfridge shows the true meaning of how people can work in a department store. Fashion attitudes and relationships are all brought together through this season. Window,1401580800,,240,5.025

5549415,5,B00B18FA50,I like most things that Jeremy Piven is in anyways--can get enough Entourage and Ari!  This was a great timepiece.  Decided to give it a try as I'm caught up with Downton Abbey and like most PBS/BBC/ITV stuff.  Entertaining and informative look back with great actors.,1401580800,,268,4.782608695652174

5549421,5,B00B18FA50,"Very good show. At first I was hesitant to watch it but said, ""what the heck"" and tried it. After the second episode, I was hooked. Looking forward to future episodes.",1401494400,,167,4.419354838709677

5549424,4,B00B18FA50,"The only downside is Jeremy Piven's dreadful monotone. His voice has absolutely no range, akin to his acting. Everything else - story, cast, sets, music - were all excellent. An engrossing story, well done.",1401494400,,206,5.088235294117647

Although it challenges the morality of monogamy (as most shows do) the characters are endearing.  I'm not a huge fan of fashion or shopping, however, I still found the history of department stores and how they evolved fascinating.  I can't wait to watch Season 2!",1401494400,,384,4.701492537313433
5549427,4,B00B18FA50,"Thoroughly enjoy the story and the superb acting that supports the story. Very real, perhaps historical - certainly not a documentary but the basis of the events may be factual. Doesn't matter; it's completely entertaining.",1401494400,,223,5.4

5549429,4,B00B18FA50,Extremely well-done British program. It shows an interesting taste of life in the early 1900s in England. No real villains but interesting characters nevertheless.,1401494400,,163,5.833333333333333
5549430,4,B00B18FA50,"I've enjoyed watching every episode of Mr Selfridge.  I'm glad to get to see Jeremy Piven do something that is outside his normal John Cusack side-kick role, even if he does seem slightly out of place among the rest of the cast - perhaps they cast him that way on purpose to highly the American in London effect.

The individual character story lines are believable and well-paced, and the art direction, costumes and settings are fabulous.

Most importantly, something actually happens each episode.  Very happy to hear this show was picked up for a 3rd Season.",1401494400,,562,4.822916666666667

5549446,5,B00B18FA50,"Love this show. Jeremy as Mr. Selfridge is interesting to watch, but seems flat in his delivery of lines at times. The young lady who plays the window dresser evolves quite nicely and it's easy to become endeared with the character.",1401408000,,232,4.682926829268292
5549447,4,B00B18FA50,"I like this show but it is sort of like ""The Paradise"". I found that offering better. If I hadn't seen Paradise I would have given Selfridge a 5 Star.",1401408000,,150,4.033333333333333
5549448,5,B00B18FA50,The characters are strong and plot lines take twisty turns.  There is some surprise in each episode.  I enjoy this show.,1401408000,,120,4.666666666666667
5549449,4,B00B18FA50,"This one didn't grab me quite as quickly as DA did, but it's growing on me.  Mr. Selfridge himself is not that sympathetic a character, at least in the beginning.  He cheats on his wife, gambles, bulldozes people, and in general seems to be representative of the worst traits attributed to Americans abroad.  That being said, the casting is as superb as Masterpiece Theater always is, and the many subplots are woven deftly together into a coherent whole.  It's not really that predictable, either, so there are surprises in every episode.  I haven't watched the entire season yet, and I'm trying not to binge and watch everything in one big sitting.  But it's not easy!",1401408000,,670,4.782608695652174

5549452,5,B00B18FA50,"It took way too long for me to give in and finally watch Mr. Selfridge, but have to say, now I'm hooked. It's particularly intriguing to analyze Harry Selfridge himself.  Brilliant businessman, full of life, energy and from what I can see, the power of positive thinking.  This genius completely believes in himself and his power to bring his dreams into reality.  I haven't watched the Secrets of Selridge yet, to see clips about the real Harry Selfridge, but Jeremy Piven's Selfridge is excellent.

Originally, I didn't care for Piven's acting, but can now see that he's perfect for this part.  Underneath that businessman's smile, always keeping an eagle eye on what's ""good for business"", lurks the memories of a tortured little boy whose relationship with his father was not the best.  It's these flash-back memories of Selfridge's childhood that spellbind and mystify.  From a psychological perspective, this man has risen to incredible heights just based on his own inner drive to one day rid himself of the harm his father inflicted upon him, and the hurtful, lingering memories.

While we can see that the memories still pain Selfridge in many of the scenes, he almost immediately finds that inner strength and determination to overcome the harmful thoughts and return to his ""state of grace"" within his own self. And, then returns the enigmatic smile.  The man overcomes the memories, and rises above them.

In this regard, I find this series, Seasons 1 and 2, an uplifting testimony to the powers within humans to overcome obstacles and childhood trauma, and find their way to peace, great success, and a more righteous approach to life.

Yes, Selfridge does have his faults, maybe a bit too arrogant at times, his philandering, which eventually stops once he truly falls in love with his wife.  I'm so heartened by this series, just for the opportunity to psychoanalyze this man and see him grow and mellow a bit to appreciate the gentler things of life and finally leave his hurtful memories behind him and find happiness.

Love this program and look forward to many more seasons.",1401408000,,2093,4.928774928774929
5549453,5,B00B18FA50,I love the whole story line and all of the characters.  Next to Downton my favorite TV show.  The season goes by so fast.,1401408000,,121,4.0

5549455,5,B00B18FA50,I watched this after Season 2 and was happier with Season 2. There was was more conflict that made it more challenging to like the characters. It did keep me interested and wanting more. The time period is both romantic and historical with the advancement of women's blossoming in the world dominated by men.,1401408000,,308,4.722222222222222

5549460,5,B00B18FA50,"The show is really well written and acted. The main character is interesting but not as interesting as some of the others.

The series is a step back in time and so believable that you feel you've passed through a time machine and are actually there.  The sets and the costumes are stunning and the coiffures change with the times.  The characters are diverse and interact in their very small world in a variety of simple and complex ways.  There is the necessary mix of lovers and the unloved, fidelity and affaires,  heroes and villains, war and peace and all done in a greater than life heroic way which is the way that Mr. Selfridge lived. Mr. Selfridge created one of the greatest department stores in the world.  He worked at the store, keenly understood his staff and customers and created an environment where he knew the least of his employees by name encouraged them to grow their skills, and made everyone proud to be a part of something bigger than themselves.

At first it seems like he is repeating that character, but once all of the English staff of his store are in place, and the complex interaction begins, his character broadens in scope and he carries this role off flawlessly.

He plays a typical loud and brash American coming to London to create a luxury department store.

If you are a Downton fan, then you will love this! It is a period piece around the same time as Downton, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a visit by Lord and Lady Crowley to make a luxury purchase!",1401235200,,604,4.383928571428571

Jeremy Piven seemed a little stiff and monotone at first, but he loosens up and really falls into the role as Mr. Selfrige. The show is well written and the cast is great.

Mr. Selfridge provides a variety of entertainment, from light hearted comedy to serious drama. I'm probably not giving it due justice, but after watching Downton Abbey and it's incredible character development, I'm left wanting just a little more from Mr. Selfridge. Still, it's been more than enough that eagerly waiting for another season to be made available. Maybe the extra episodes will be enough for the deeper character development that I'm seeking!",1401148800,,577,5.282608695652174

5549550,2,B00B18FA50,"To start from the top, Jeremy Piven is simply, outrageously awful.  The man cannot act.  His pronouncements ring false as does every line he screams.  At times, he's embarrassing.  For a show that claims to show the beginnings of the luxury department store, you see very little of the store and its products and his self-proclaimed marketing wizardry.  You hear about it, but don't see it.  Most of the times, you see all the shop-girls, dressed in black, folding and refolding and folding again little pieces of silk.  It really is a joke, I hope.  The rest of the cast is quite appealing and the subplots about them rise to a level the show itself never achieves.  If you're idea of a good times is watching a bad actor bloviating, this is the show for you.",1400889600,,760,4.529411764705882
5549551,5,B00B18FA50,"A great story and well acted. It is based on on the life of a real man. It is easy to identify with his triumphs and trials and the people he comes in contact.  I also love the fashions, hairstyles, automobiles and airplanes introduced.

I bought this on the recommendation that if I like Downton, I would like this.  They were supposedly the same quality entertainment. I did not think so. The costumes are wonderful, but I found both the Selfridge story and characters hard to stay interested in.

Stage design draws you in and you forget that they film in they 21st century.  The acting is superb.  I had luck with timing because I started watching when KPBS did a marathon of S1 to prepare for the release of S2.  I loved it and didn't have to wait long for S2.  I thought season 1 was great, season 2 keeps me on the edge of my seat and wanting more.  I love how they tie in the series with historic figures and events.

5549562,3,B00B18FA50,"I was very intrigued with its start, but in the end it becomes too much of a soap opera. And I may be alone in this opinion, but I don't think the lead actor is up to this role. Too often he looks like he's acting. Mind you, I realize that at times the character he plays is himself supposed to be putting on an act, but it still felt forced to me. The actor is not a physically imposing man, but he's playing a man with an imposing personality. In my opinion the actor just doesnt have whats needed for the character to have a personality that takes over a room. Theres simply isn't anything special about him that makes me want to focus on him. I also thought it could have done without all the bedroom romping scenes. It added to the soap opera feel of it.",1400803200,,759,4.100671140939597

5549572,5,B00B18FA50,"although Sherlock is pretty well up there too.

This is such a fabulous series that I don't know where to start. I saw the U.S. edition, but I didn't see one on Amazon to rate.

Based on a real man and a real department store in London, they found lots to work with. For example, the store still exists. They restored it (or a section of it?) to the palatial experience it was when it opened in the early years of the 20th Century. Wow, oh wow! The Yank, Mr. Selfridge, moves to London to open it after much success at home. Introducing the English to the idea of browsing was monumental. Actually being able to see and choose for yourself from the merchandise was unheard of. You usually told a shopkeeper what you were interested in, and they brought out which ones they wanted you to see from behind the counter.

Selfridge puts everything out in glass displays and on the top. A trip there is more like an occasion to the early shoppers of last century. They eventually revel in their newfound freedom. The struggles Harry has along the way make for great television. Wonderful stories and characters make this my favorite series in a long time. I don't know how PBS can top this, but I hope they try.",1400716800,,1205,4.418918918918919

I do wish the season 2 would be free to amazon prime members. Alas, when it becomes available for us members, free of charge, then I will watch season 2.  Until then there is so much else to watch and enjoy.",1400716800,,421,4.172839506172839
5549576,5,B00B18FA50,"I greatly enjoyed this program, especially knowing it was inspired by true life events. The real Selfridges department store in the UK is considered one of the best department stores in the WORLD, so Mr. Selfridge did leave a lasting legacy. This series is charming and reveals what the world was like before any safety net existed (the world the current Republican party wishes us to regress to). The poor were dirt poor and desperately aligned themselves with an establishment like Selfridges while the 1% of the time lived in great luxury and general disdain for the poor. Each character is memorable, a true creation of the director and actor who played the role. The episodes are personal to the characters, even though the overriding issues of the period (Women's Sufferage Movement, World War 1) were present in the stories. I truly recommend this series.",1400716800,,862,4.951724137931034

5549582,5,B00B18FA50,"I found this when it had only 3 programs left in the 2nd Season, but quickly caught up thanks to the internet.  Harry Selfridge was a brilliant & courageous man, who like most of that ilk, was also badly flawed personally.  I've always thought it sad to watch people that are true visionaries wind up tripping over their own foibles & ultimately self-destructing.  He led the way to our ""modern"" shopping with common sense... can you conceive of shopping for a day when there were NO women's restrooms in stores...  Of having to wait for a male member of your family to ""take"" you shopping?  Right!  He brought ""freedom"" to British women as only an arrogant, bright, ""just do it"" American attitude could.  He gave the ""shop girls"" pride & a decent salary... He gave women ""ready made dresses"" & he gave us the ""Bargain Basement"" among many other (now common) shopping concepts... but, as so many others who have moments of brilliance, he ultimately self-destructed  & I hope the series ends before we have to see it happen....",1400716800,,1026,4.692737430167598
5549583,5,B00B18FA50,Masterpiece always has great shows. Definitely worth watching. This show is a bit more fast paced than Downton Abby (which I very much like). Many of the characters in Mr. Selfridge seem more three dimensional as well.,1400716800,,218,4.918918918918919

I think he's supposed to be charming, but I find him to be dishonest, unrealistic where his business is concerned, of questionable character, and overall, a buffoon full of careless antics which harm others as well as himself.  I can't get in his corner and hope for his business to succeed.  I don't care if it does or not.

5549589,5,B00B18FA50,"It's refreshing because it's filmed at a time when technology and modern ways had not yet been born.  To think that skirt lengths mattered or that make-up was not openly on display at a store seems rediculous now, but it shows what a long way we've come and what it took to get here.

The characters are sometimes strong and sometimes shy and subtle, but they all have a message and the way the show is done, everyone can be heard, not just the loudest or boldest character!  The costumes are not colorful, yet intriguing and not distracting.

My husband and I are so excited to see every new episode!",1400716800,,601,4.4363636363636365
5549590,5,B00B18FA50,Really enjoyed this show...good acting and story line! It's quite educational giving a glimpse of the times. I have recommended it to friends.,1400716800,,142,5.217391304347826
5549591,5,B00B18FA50,"In the same atmosphere of Downton Abby, this is a really interesting period piece.  It shows about the pre-consumer shopping era in England.  If you liked Downton Abby or The Paradise, you'll like this one.",1400716800,,206,4.857142857142857
5549592,5,B00B18FA50,"An original concept with plenty of intrigue and after one episode, it's easy to see this is going to remain interesting. The cast is very well thought out and revealing the dark side of Selfridge and the honesty of the times gives it more authenticity.",1400716800,,252,4.622222222222222

5549596,5,B00B18FA50,"I didn't know what to expect but it was really good.  If you like the quality of BBC shows and the better acting that the Brits seem to have over our American shows, you will also like this one.  I had only seen Jeremy Piven in Entourage and even though I liked his performance, I wasn't sure if could play a serious part.  He is surprisingly good in this, showing that he can effectively act different moods and emotions.  It's a well done show.  This is a welcome break from the flood of smart alleck American sitcoms and violence.",1400630400,,533,4.343434343434343

was delightful. I had just read the book previously and thoroughly enjoyed it, so when the series began I was on board

5549652,5,B00B18FA50,"This show is very well made as a period production. The character of Mr. Selfridge, played by Jeremy Piven, is epic! He is such a powerhouse, but becomes so disappointed by the character of those around him when they falter, that he almost comes off as nave. Of course, his own flaws are simply part of his being and to be accepted. His ability to bounce back from almost any failure is constant throughout the season.
His business practices and marketing schemes are genius and still ethical for the major part. This is a coup, considering the time period. However, his personal life is ruled by turmoil and double standards which threaten to ruin his idyllic family picture.",1400457600,,676,4.737288135593221

Just can't get over the miscasting of the two actors in the main roles (Selfridge and wife) -- Jememy Piven is particularly wooden and bad, such that I cringed my way through his scenes. Can't help but make an extremely non-favorable comparison with the older, well-acted PARADISE.",1400371200,,392,5.338709677419355

I didn't think I would like this show because I thought it would be just another show about the class system in England trying to make a hit show off of Downton Abbey the craze. I find the characters interesting and the show is holds my interest. I look forward to watching it every Sunday evening. I didn't give it four stars because I tend to compare it to Downton Abbey and I like Downton Abbey better. It is a quality show and I am proud to be a PBS supporter. I am happy PBS is airing quality and popular shows. I know that funding has been cut for public television which is a shame. Give it a watch.,1400371200,,739,4.211267605633803

A good friend told me to ""give it time"", so I will continue to watch, and will update this review if I feel it gets better, but right now  well, I would give it 2.5 stars if I could - 3 stars is actually 'rounding up'  your mileage may vary.

This is a wonderful historical drama that perfectly captures early 20th Century England and the infancy of the modern department store. The costumes and interiors are fantastic.

Mr. Selfridge airs on my local PBS station at 8pm, immediately after Call the Midwife. Since I had an hour before Mad Men started, I took a chance and watched it. I am so glad that I did and that I have Amazon Prime! I was able to watch Season 1 in its entirety with Amazon Prime and now I able to finish out season 2 with more background information on the character's interplay and a larger celebrity crush on Mr. Piven (despite the character he plays). Jeremy Piven is fantastic in this show. His ability to alter facial expressions and body language as Mr. Slefridge are worth watching. The sets, costumes and historical references are charming and entertaining.",1400284800,,794,4.520833333333333

5549715,5,B00B18FA50,"Great period piece on an American midwestern entrepreneur running loose in stuffy 'ole London, England at the turn of the last century. Jeremy Piven shows his range as the P.T. Barnum of department stores. The rest of the cast is not as well known (to me at least), but are just as good as Piven and really take the show to another level.

Subplots are interesting (as PBS shows always are) and fun to follow. Bottom line though, is that Piven has serious acting chops and makes the best of them as Mr. Selfridge.",1400112000,,513,4.457446808510638

Had no idea this was based on a real-life store and how much the real man changed the industry.  Series is interesting and fast-paced.  Never was a Piven fan and usually avoided his work.  I made an exception for this series.  If you like historical series, this is definitely worth your time.",1400112000,,438,4.3875

The costumes are incredible and the story draws one in every time.  All the actors bring their own professionally and add so much to the show.  A must-see for anyone who enjoys period pieces with superb acting.",1400025600,,386,4.892307692307693

5549733,4,B00B18FA50,"Well worth watching, how an ambitious american changed the face of the UK. I personally never had heard of Selfridges and found it interesting, as well as the look back in time at British society of that time.

Great characters and story lines.  I can hardly wait each week for the new episodes (Season 2).  I loved being able to watch one after another of Season One on Amazon.",1399939200,,337,4.566666666666666

5549743,4,B00B18FA50,"Overall, this show is intriguing and I am compelled to keep watching...  I'm just 5 episodes into the first season.  At this point I can say that the majority of the cast is brilliant with Aisling Loftus being the standout.  very believable.  I'm not sure why the American characters (the Selfridges) are being directed in such a way, but with the exception of Frances O'Connor who is giving the most believable performance in the family, the Selfridges do not pull in any compassion.  Jeremy Piven, though a good actor, is very flat, if that is possible given the grand gestures his every physical movement is.  His expression are spot on and the motivation clear.... but the line delivery is overwhelmingly amateurish...  I don't understand why that is, being that he is a pretty spot on actor, so therefor must be direction... maybe.",1399939200,,836,4.845070422535211

5549745,4,B00B18FA50,"I'm watching the show but I feel like I'm watching ""Mr Selfridge"" in a Broadway play.  He over-acts and practically screams out his lines.  I like the other actors in the show, especially his ""long suffering"" wife -- she's doing a good job.  It's a period piece and the set design and clothing are both excellent.  The dialogue is often good but nearly as often stilted.  I gave it a 4 star for those reasons in particular. If I were to rate Jeremy P, I'd probably give him a 4 for effort and difficulty in remembering and ""reciting loudly"" his script and a 3 for the actual delivery.  Call me crazy....but I keep watching it.",1399939200,,626,4.4
5549746,4,B00B18FA50,Interesting to see a American merchant be successful in England.  Never knew self ridges was created by an American.  Lead actor is great,1399939200,,137,4.913043478260869
5549747,4,B00B18FA50,"Mr. Selfridge is a good period drama about the founding of the department store of the same name.  It is strange that PBS would produce and air Mr. Selfridge at the same time of a very similar drama about the founding of another department store during the same historical period, both with a charismatic male lead and a world of is ail and romantic intrigues swirling around the respective department store,  having started watching The Paradise first, I found Mr. Selfridge less interesting than I otherwise might have.",1399939200,,521,4.909090909090909

5549764,5,B00B18FA50,"Nice period piece based on the life of a real person.  An American who moved to London and built a new kind of department store that would challenge the norm.

The center piece of the series however, is the store itself and the attention to detail. It the things that people buy and how they are marketed is a wonderful window into society during a dynamic period of history when society and technology were changing at an unbelievable rate.

The characters are well-developed and the complexities of their relationships and their choices come through making them very easy to relate to. There are no entirely ""good"" characters--they are all flawed humans trying to adjust to cultural changes. I particularly enjoy watching the female characters struggle to develop their own unique identity in a society that still prohibits married women from working outside the home. This struggle to be successful in their career paths and satisfy their relational needs is compelling.",1399593600,,687,5.142857142857143

We're talking never got out of my pajamas, sit in the living from the time I got up until bedtime kind of weekend.  Downton Abbey was wonderful, and after I finished the series I went into withdraw for those wonderful characters.

I don't remember how I found Mr Selfridge, but I love this series every bit as much.  The characters are real.  Yes,they do mean nasty things, and bad things happen, but the show isn't violent, or cruel.  It isn't harsh, and ugly.  Each character is rich with personality, and has many layers to them.  You slowly understand them, and why they are the way they are.....and you come to love each of them.  It'a like watching a wonderful English novel.....",1399507200,,778,4.539568345323741

I can't stop myself watching several episodes in a row until the wee hours. I can't wait to watch the rest of the season two.

5549861,5,B00B18FA50,"What I find most fascinating about this series is not necessarily its acting and sets and the plot, but how it shows us the beginnings of what we take for granted these days when it comes to shopping.  How England goes from small, privately-owned shops where you have to buy a coat in one shop, soap in another, jewelry in another, tea in another--where you aren't really allowed to touch the merchandise by your lonesome, but are served--to a modern department store such as Selfridges where the goods are on display and you can touch and smell and see them.  What a change!

The show starts off with the building of the store and Harry Selfridge getting backing for his enterprize, mainly by working with Lady Mae (a woman who started in the theatre and married into the nobility) who sets the local fashion trends and knows men of money.  Harry Selfridge lives life big, not just in his business but his private life as we meet his long-suffering wife who has to put up with his love of the ladies.  After the store is built, then Selfridge needs to teach Londoners how to enjoy shopping, not just with the beautiful displays but with publicity stunts and getting a fabulous woman to be the face of Selfridges.

This is an interwoven plot with many stories going at the same time.  My favorite is that of the poor woman who comes into Selfridges women's fashion and soon finds herself blossoming with ideas, even as she has to continue to help her less than bright brother and deal with an alcoholic father.

But the real star of the show remains the store itself.  Vivid colors, beautiful hats and dresses, and lovely displays that I would find hard to resist myself.  I want to shop at this store so badly...which is half the point.  The second star of the show is Selfridge himself...outspoken, bombastic, a little crazy, powerfully dedicated to his business, and who is always talking about how important the employees are to his store.  Here is a man you would want to work for and be loyal to.  Not a perfect man, but a fascinating one.

Great series.  I don't like it as much as Downton Abbey, but I do love it in its own way.",1399334400,,2136,4.511688311688312
5549862,5,B00B18FA50,"Mr Selfridge is from the Masterpiece Classic collection. And it is amazingly done. The musical score draws you in from the first moment, before you've even seen the actors.

The writing and acting are great, the costumes are fabulous, hairstyles are even better.  And, as with so many of these period dramas, the cultural history is fascinating.  Listening to Selfridge discuss with his staff the then controversial issue of how to display cosmetics--the risk involved in even acknowledging that respectable women wear rouge--is just delightful.  I've convinced my husband to watch it with me and he's hooked.",1399334400,,612,4.893203883495145

Jeremy Piven and other cast members really recreate the early era of shopping and debauchery!,1399248000,,249,4.813953488372093

As good as this miniseries is, and it is a superior offering, it can only scratch the surface of the story of his life.  The noble rise from small beginnings to the ignominious fall from great heights.  A truly fascinating mind.  I would love to read a complete psychological profile of this man whose life has touched your life and mine in myriad ways.",1399161600,,460,4.560975609756097

5549902,5,B00B18FA50,"I enjoyed the first season of Mr. Selfridge very much. It is of Masterpiece Theater quality, a treat to watch. The actors are engaging and the costumes and sets are fantastic. The writing and acting is so well done that I am interested in what is going on with each of the main characters. While a bit of a scoundrel, Mr. Selfridge's enthusiasm, attention and big ideas that always seem to be carried out keep the show moving quickly along so it's easy to imagine his world. I love that I can be fully entertained while learning about early department store processes and fashion as well as world history. I look forward to the opening scenes/music and Mr. Selfridge's approving and self-satisfied twinkling eye smile as he makes the store opening rounds.",1399161600,,755,4.7272727272727275

5549927,5,B00B18FA50,"Right here acting is good and actors are charming while mostly representing good living and better times with community and country. The story links many of us with our personal histories concerning Marshall Fields of Chicago, (thus Fredrick & Nelson of Seattle USA), because we know the common values and expectations for ""retail marketing"" that housed an architecture for living. This may seem like soap opera as do most season-series, but it is most relaxing and enjoyable, a history worth remembering. For a glimpse at the before retail-market, see ""House of Elliott"" also in London's history annals.",1398902400,,604,5.237113402061856

Some Google searching of the name Selfridge revealed that the story is based a true person.  I don't know if the story is true to his character or not.  The story line is about a strong, ambitious, self-reliant man from outward appearances.  His determination to continue this vision is a cover-up of nagging inferior background which is depicted by his double life-style after hours.

The writing is excellent. We are hoping they'll have a Season 3. Very interesting and a historic look into how department stores evolved. If the character is accurate, Mr. Selfridge must have been the greatest business owner of his time.

5550020,2,B00B18FA50,"I thought this would be very interesting as it is about an American businessman who moves to London to open a unique dept. store.  He has many new ideas but he's not always honest both professionally and personally.
Unfortunately,  in my opinion, the story dragged along and although I usually like Jeremy Piven in this role he comes across as a brash, self important, American.
I actually skipped from episode 2 to episode 10 to see how the first season ended.  I wouldn't go on to see the rest.  Sorry.",1398470400,,504,4.566666666666666

5550022,1,B00B18FA50,Sure it's a great series ... but Amazon only gives you the 1st season FREE and then starts charging you after that.  Season 2 is in progress now and they want $1.99 per episode.  I think where series are concerned you better watch out lest you have to PAY once you get hooked.,1398470400,,276,4.188679245283019

We settle down for a nice movie night together and discover this won't play on an American DVD player. Crazy. Completely useless and a waste of money. How do I return this and who would sell this to an American address?,1398384000,2,321,4.03125
5550029,1,B00B18FA50,"the worst!  Jeremy Piven needs to stick to shallow and shi-tay portrayals of vapid Hollywood types.  and I just love how the British are trying to get back at us because we make fun of their horrible teeth (and rightfully so) by casting every American character as some obnoxious, bombastic a-hole.  As much as I love downton abbey, the absolute worst character who makes me cringe is cora's horrible and disgusting, rude mother - THE AMERICAN.  Notice how Cora herself is all refined and lovely yet she comes from the stock of this hideous and monstrous woman who is supposedly super rich yet acts like a truck driver.... a hillbilly has more manners. and the casting for mr. selfridge is exactly like cora's mother except now it's some dude trying to open a store.  no wonder the british lost the war so long ago - vainglorious idiots.  I hate mr.selfridge, what horrible acting.... I could never dream of someone in that day rolling and cracking their neck like some negroe from the ghetto in the year 1999.  give me a break.... what is he supposed to be, a baseball player or something?  this is ridiculous and insults me.  too bad they couldn't have cast someone a little more gentlemanly.  Jeremy Piven is only good at the role that was made for his shallow personality....entourage.  I hate everyone in this show because of this.",1398384000,7,1336,4.690987124463519

5550032,4,B00B18FA50,I can't wait to see more. The potential for several very interesting story lines is quite apparent. There's nothing like an American crossing the pond and starting a business.,1398384000,,175,5.068965517241379

The show focuses on women and men working for the same establishment and all the issues that are caused by the close relationships while Victorian rules still apply. The advent of cars and planes, shorter skirts and one Mr Selfridge who is a marketing genius.

This series shows is great detail the changing of times and how they come about.  I enjoy every storyline!",1398384000,,485,4.831325301204819

I personally have never seen anything on Masterpiece Theatre that was not terrific!  Of course true to form, it held up to the standards I expected.  Love the clothing, the set decoration, the impeccable attention to detail and time periods.  Really made me have an even stronger understanding of this time period.  The character development is slow going, but stick with it.  They eventually do emerge.  I have never been disappointed in Jeremy Piven's  performance, and while I think his acting is good in this, I felt he was mis-cast.  I keep thinking there is something about his voice that detracts from the character, or is distracting me. I could be wrong, I can't quite define it.",1398297600,,832,4.6506849315068495

However, very early in the series, the major character, Mr. Selfridge demonstrates no character by setting up housekeeping with his mistress who is in his employ, so indiscreetly, wife hears of it!

It's a poor turn of events and the writer should have developed the characters more before introducing this cheap tactic to try and suck in his audience. It backfired with me.",1398297600,9,468,5.157894736842105

Interesting to see how much or little things have changed in the retail business. The actors are very talented. I'm not too well acquainted with all of them, but by the time I'm done watching all of them, I'm sure I will be. I would say this is on the scale of Downton Abbey.

In my opinion a dreadful miscasting intended to please American viewers.  Sadly, as with the later seasons of Downton Abbey, it seems that British historical dramas are doing their best to make good in the States.  I do miss their distinctly British character.

The main character is full of life, ideas, and recklessness but he manages to keep his department store going as an American in a very stuffy British environment. I picked the series just out of boredom for something to watch by PBS. Little did I know that I would become hooked. Excellent story , great characters and wonderfully acted.

It showed that anyone with ambition, drive and hard work could achieve what they wanted -- unfortunately sometimes at the expense of family. It also gave insight into the worker's lives -- their ambition and drive. Looking forward to Series 2.",1397952000,,288,4.8979591836734695

5550155,5,B00B18FA50,"Jeremy Pivens does a terrific job as Mr Selfridge.
He's always playing strong characters that do what ever it takes to get what he wants or the job done.
His roles previous also include a lot of Adult language and scenes.
This is refreshing because we get to see and appreciate Jeremy's talent of acting in pure form.
The series is a period piece set in the early 1900's around the time of the Suffrage movement.
The character Mr Selfridge is an American businessman that has relocated to England to establish a department store akin to Marshall Fields (Macy's). It shows how he goes about acquiring funding for the store to be built, to how the employees are hired and his family life. The large ensemble cast is wonderful. The side stories are entertaining and moving.
Jeremy Piven should get an award for this piece of work- simply amazing.
Season 2 has not disappointed either.",1397865600,,881,4.690322580645161

Barnum-esque magic show of creating and refining modern day shopping experiences.  A little razza-a-ma-tazz keeps the customers coming, but not his personal demons or marriage intact.

5550169,4,B00B18FA50,"While I wouldn't exactly put this series on the level of, say, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" (the original 1975) or ""Brideshead Revisited"", it is a fun look back at the mores of the late 19th-early 20th century through the historical? eyes of an American dream builder in London.  The cast is excellent and you have the goodies, baddies, goodies who are sometimes bad and troublemakers who all cross paths in connection with Selfridge's Department Store.

marketing in the early 1900's. I especially like the advent of cosmetics and perfume for the purchase for the
ladies of the day. Mr. Selfridge manages to smile and find a positive solution for his troubles. The ladies are emerging as independent
people who can think for themselves and make their way. Based on a true person, this show is a fun and visually glorious representation
of a Yankee who makes good in a somewhat stifled world of the British.",1397779200,,546,4.639175257731959

We find it captivating. Loosely based on the true story of Harry Gordon Selfridge, the man who decided, ""the customer is always right,"" this series captures his showmanship and free-wheeling personality.  Critics don't seem to care for Jeremy Piven's acting, but I think he has captured the essence of a showman who was at times himself a very poor actor and doomed to self destruction.",1397606400,,628,4.761467889908257

He was really out cast by the rest of the cast. He over acted as usual but did a good enough job that the show was not ruined by his lack of skill.  The rest of the cast was superb. I would have liked to see another actor in the lead role which would have made this an outstanding production far better. I love Masterpiece theater. I have been faithfully watching since I was in college. Please don't miss this very well done and fine showing of the period piece. Many far superior  performances were done by the rest of the cast.

5550224,3,B00B18FA50,"I'll be honest.  I don't like Jeremy Piven.  If you do, then you will likely want to give this 5 stars.  The rest of the cast is excellent, and the writing is good. Since I have only watched the first season, I'm not sure where the story is going so it isn't fair to say there didn't seem to be a point to the show, though sometimes it felt that way,  Jeremy Piven as Mr. Selfridge overacted to the point where I had a hard time appreciating the show during some episodes.",1397520000,,472,4.0978260869565215

Used to criticize them back in the 70s and 80s for overly dramatic and dull programs - but they are producing the best television in the world right now.

5550230,5,B00B18FA50,It was a fast moving look at life at the turn of the centuary.  The downplay of women in the work place was shown.  The sufferage movement was starting.  Very enjoyable.,1397520000,,169,4.387096774193548

I won't be watching season 2 for the sexual content. I loved some of the characters and will miss the story from that stand point, but there's enough ugliness in the world without watching a fictional version too.

This show is outstanding.  -Fast paced, interesting characters, beautifully produced.  Some people think that Pivens plays the lead role over the top, but I think if you're going to play a human dynamo like Selfridge, half measures won't do.  He does a great job of conveying both the outrageous showmanship and private self-doubt of the man.  -First class television worth watching.",1397433600,,503,5.397435897435898
5550252,4,B00B18FA50,I really don't have complaints about this series. It is beatifully crafted and acted. But it doesn't quite take me to that quintessential place that I have often experienced with other Masterpiece Theater productions. But well worth the time.,1397433600,,242,5.230769230769231

My family can hardly wait for Sunday night to watch the next episode. I highly recommend this excellent television series.

It is fascinating how women evolved into shoppers and Selfridge, an visionary, understood the human mind and to sell items yet not a clue on how to love his wife! Now department stores are becoming things of the past with our next generation using the web or small speciality shops.  Very happy with the changes in our clothing over the past 100 yrs as I don't like tight clothing!!",1397347200,,450,4.625

5550270,5,B00B18FA50,"I loved Downton Abby and a friend suggested this program.  It is a great show and it is such a pleasure to watch a show that doesn't include violance, or profanity. It's a wonderful story of a man who creates his vision of a modern department store in England during the early 1900's.  This program and Downton Abby were created with quality.",1397347200,,342,4.5

5550274,4,B00B18FA50,"I don't know why this series isn't getting the same amount of viewers as ""Downton Abbey"".  The acting is wonderful, the costumes sublime, and it is based on a true story.  Jeremy Piven is outstanding as the charismatic Mr Selfridge.  He is responsible for the commonly used advertising phrase, ""__shopping days remain until Christmas"", and came up with the idea of the ""bargain basement"".  It has enough young actors to attract a twentysomething audience, but is probably suited for ages 35 and up.  Give it a try!  You'll be hooked.",1397347200,,533,4.866666666666666

Every visual detail is perfect - characters are authentic, flawed, and oh so interesting - especially since Mr. Selfridge and his famous department are real.  You don't need to mourn the ending of Mad Men or think there is nothing to watch until Downton Abbey returns - the new season of Mr. Selfridge just started - and this UK edition of Season 1 will get you all caught up on this fascinating story.",1397347200,,460,4.530120481927711

5550281,5,B00B18FA50,"We saw series one after seeing the first couple of episodes of season two. Although the second series is a continuance of the story, there is a few disjointed parts to the story such as the girl returning from France after two years of study there [we didn't know from series one that Selfridge sent her] and some of the actors changed. It is still a compelling story to watch.",1397347200,,377,4.4

I missed it when it came on so I decided to give it a try on Amazon Premium after seeing the commercial for the second season on tv. I got hooked right on the first episode.

I did want to see what happened to the store, so I continued watching the entire first season and found that I liked the show after all.  He did have a heart and feelings and cared about his staff.  What I didn't like was that it was ok for him to have an affair, but couldn't accept that his wife might do the same thing.  I guess that was what happened in those days, at least among the rich.",1397088000,,566,4.311320754716981
5550340,5,B00B18FA50,"I really enjoy this series.  I have such interesting memories since childhood of department stores.  I grew up around the classic department stores, Kaufmanns, Joseph Horns, Gimbles, I Magnin, Bonwit Teller, & Robinsons.  They are all gone now but they popped up in the early 1900's and survived for decades finally disappearing in the 80's & early 90's.  To me they were magical places.  Mr. Selfridge captures that magic, the artistry of window design, the classic style of customer service.  I like the theme of the  ""American"" who brings values & work ethic to a place like London  during a time when people were under valued & under paid.  Mr. Selfridge represents a standard that this country mirrored to the world at one time; of meaningful work & caring employers that reward employees with health care, good pay & ample time off.  The characters are colorful, it's a great storyline, great writers, captures early 20th century London, period of challenging & rapidly changing times on many fronts.",1397088000,,1006,4.970059880239521

5550377,3,B00B18FA50,"I'm still not sure what I think about this series.  I agree with other reviews that the first few episodes are horrible. But I kept watching it and somehow got drawn into the series.  Perhaps it is because of the development of the other characters that make it worth returning to althoug the overall plot is pretty weak. At first I thought Jeremy Piven was hideous with his vocal blustering and aggressive mannerisms.  Now I think that is how they character is supposed to be portrayed. After you watch it for a while it all seems to make some sort of sense. Still though, there is a sense of Americans are loud and boisterious while British are refined and controlled. Truthfully, I never knew there was a ""Mr. Selfridge""  until this series so I cannot say if it is a proper characterization or not. I will watch Season 2.  Perhaps something interesting will develop.",1397001600,,869,4.616883116883117

I wasn't too sure of Jeremy Piven's acting abilities in this style but took a chance and was blown away by the depth of character this series possesses and multiple story lines that are all very complex.

I LOVED THIS! Jeremy Piven is AWESOME! It seems as if this is the perfect role for him.

What I am most curious about is the deep red color theme that is present throughout...it is subtle but intriguing, I'm sure it alludes to the ever present seduction and sensuality of the whole thing...",1397001600,,766,4.536231884057971

Piven's Selfridge is a loveable curmudgeon. I can't wait for the rest of Season 2. I highly recommend. Just as addicting as Downton Abbey.",1397001600,,283,4.3584905660377355
5550384,3,B00B18FA50,After the first episode it just OK....possibly because we keep on comparing it to Downton Abbey.  We will have to watch a few more episodes to see if it get's any better.,1397001600,,170,4.3125

5550386,5,B00B18FA50,I love most shows based in this time period.  Started with Downton Abbey....and on that show they were always talking about going to LONDON.  So now I see what was going on in London during this time period also.  Jeremy Pivens is so lovable in this series. Wish everyone could have a 'Boss' like him. : ),1397001600,,305,4.315789473684211

5550390,1,B00B18FA50,"As most reviewers, I am a fan of Masterpiece Theater, therefore  Mr. Selfridge proved to be a tremendous disappointment.

The story purports to be based on the life of  H. G. Selfridge, but in reality it is 80% fiction and 20% caricature.  This I could have forgiven, if the stories and subplots were interesting; but they not.

The plots are predictable and  hardly qualify as drama or comedy.  However, the worst part of the show is the acting.  I have seen High School productions with better acting.  And here I cannot blame the actors.  So many embarrassing performances have to be the result of bad direction.

Poor story, bad acting, terrible direction.  I wish Amazon had 1/2 a star.",1397001600,3,691,4.714285714285714

The story seems like a lot of fun with all kinds of intrigue mixed in. It doesn't end on a bad note, but it left me thinking bad was about to happen, on many fronts. I guess that is the point with a first episode, but honestly, I don't watch TV shows to feel badly about life, but rather to escape, so I'm not sure how long I'll stay with this program. We'll see how the second episode goes.",1396915200,,537,4.123809523809523

5550419,1,B00B18FA50,"For those who enjoyed the recent MPT series, The Paradise, it is hard to find a rationale for Mr. Selfridge. While not a carbon copy, the themes are somewhat similar; upstart retail visionary turns London mercantile on its ear. However, that is where the similarity ends. I have loved Jeremy Pivens acting in other series, most notably as Ari Gold in The Entourage. However, his characterization of Mr. Selfridge is flat to the point of being one dimensional. On the plus side, the cinematography and editing is first rate, as is the soundtrack.

I won't be watching the second season, needless to say.",1396828800,3,602,4.844660194174757

The acting is superb as are the costumes.  The story lines are intriguing and the characters well defined.  It won't ever replace Downton Abbey but it is a pleasant surprising close second.  Makes me want to read more about the American Selfridge himself and all the notable figures who visit his department store.  Very well done,",1396828800,,479,4.925

Mr. Selfridge to turns English culture on its head, as it introduces the first real department store in the very new American style of the day.

5550468,5,B00B18FA50,"This series is about a man who went from nothing to owning and operating a very large department store in London, England and creating an adventurous shopping experience (for the time). It is not a biography, but is based on real people and events.  The costumes are authentic-looking and the acting reflects the morals of the times.  I really enjoyed this series and am looking forward to viewing Season 2.",1396656000,,407,4.8

5550476,4,B00B18FA50,"I was very hesitant to give this show a chance simply because of the lead actor. While I love Jeremy Pivens, I just could not buy him playing the role...sorry Jeremy. Also, I just wasn't sure I wanted to watch a show based on a store. So this viewing took me some time to accept. After talking with some ladies in a department store, who love the show; I decided to give it a whirl. I must admit 2 things: 1). I LOVE this show!!! and 2). I was CORRECT...I simply cannot buy him playing the role. :( hence my 4 star rating. However, I would NOT let my one flaw of the show discourage you from watching. It is a personal thing for me because I cannot get him out of my head from watching him in his first late 80's movie roles. And although he has had a great career and I am very glad he is no longer the sidekick... I am sure to an unknown audience he is fantastic but I keep waiting for Cameron Crowe to yell ""CUT.""",1396656000,,916,4.0109289617486334

5550488,4,B00B18FA50,"I resisted watching this in its first season because the trailers didn't appear to appeal to my preferences. After seeing a documentary and realizing that Mr. Selfridge and the store he established are an authentic part of history, I decided to investigate the series. I was surprised to find that the story line is very engaging, the characters are varied and well developed, the actors/actresses are delightful and the quality of the production is high. I started at the beginning of the week watching one (1) episode per evening of Season 1; last night I found myself watching three (3) episodes consecutively and intend to do the same this evening. I am eager to watch Season 2.",1396569600,,682,4.837606837606837
5550489,4,B00B18FA50,I am a period piece enthusiast and very much enjoyed these episodes.  Fascinating to Wikipedia Mr. and Mrs. Selfridge and gather other amazing information about them.  Mrs. Selfridge was independently very wealthy and was a very accomplished woman in her own right.,1396569600,,265,5.285714285714286
5550490,2,B00B18FA50,I was surprised how bored I was watching this. The story moves slowly and the characters were not engaging. The Paradise was a much better show featuring a department store.,1396569600,,173,4.8

5550495,4,B00B18FA50,What a great romp through the Gibson girl era.  Watching the the gorgeous styles and the PT Barnum style showmanship of Selfridge.  His support of women and the Suffragette movement is quite surprising.  It's hard to believe that women in the USA have only had the vote for less than 100 years.  Sometime entertainment makes one think.,1396569600,,335,4.824561403508772

5550500,5,B00B18FA50,"Found this by accident one night and I'm hooked.  While it doesn't rank as high as Downton Abbey, it is definitely a must see for anyone that enjoys the amazing series that the UK gives us.  Jeremy Piven is everything that Mr. Selfridge should be, arrogant, misguided, self centered, unsure and just a pleasure to watch.  I've started watching from Season One as I missed many of the first editions.  I purchased the book for my Kindle to see how closely the series follows the book, something I always do.  The settings are just right to make you feel like you are back in time; the dialog and portrayal of the way society was then are great additions.",1396569600,,653,4.5

5550506,5,B00B18FA50,This is a great series with lots of complex relationships that keep changing.  The British are just good at putting these shows together.  It is worth watching if you like Downton Abbey.,1396569600,,186,4.78125

5550516,5,B00B18FA50,This is one of the few dvds I have purchased. I will view this many times over. Piven is perfect in this role and I love the rest of the cast too.

5550517,5,B00B18FA50,"As an American who lived in London for 8 years, I could really relate to a lot of what Harry Gordon Selfridge went through, regardless of it being 100 years earlier. Some things, it seems, never change. I've also always loved to shop at Selfridges, so found the history of the store to be fascinating. The acting in the show is superb and the characters are all well rounded and interesting. I'm very much looking forward to watching Season 2.",1396483200,3,443,4.55
5550518,5,B00B18FA50,"I greatly enjoyed all parts of this series that I've seen so far. The content and quality are great. But I think there are two improvements that you might consider:

1. Find a way to add subtitles. Note: Netflix and nearly all DVDs allow for subtitles. This is a standard feature. Why isn't it with Amazon?
2. Develop a better way to move forward or backwards more slowly when watching the film. For example, if I want to go back just a few seconds, the button on my remote control will move it backwards, but at a speed too fast that takes be back earlier than I wanted to go. Netflix streaming does not have this problem.

I also stream movies from Netflix and do not have these problems. Check out the Netflix streaming and you'll see what I mean.",1396483200,2,750,4.35
5550519,4,B00B18FA50,A pretty interesting story with a lot of sub plots. Lightweight watching when you don't want to think a lot.,1396483200,,108,4.45
5550520,5,B00B18FA50,"We loved this show.  It was really fun to watch.  Since it all takes place in London, it gives you a different perspective on Edwardian England than Downton Abbey.  Also, it is inspirational as you see how an American arrived in London and made a great success.",1396483200,3,261,4.51063829787234
5550521,5,B00B18FA50,"As a story based on a real person Mr Selfridge reminds me of where the department store idea got started.

The case is busted and will not hold the discs. There is no list of episodes, length of episodes or total duration of program. This is a stripped down version and not the Masterpiece released. It was falsely advertised. Be careful when purchasing this blu-ray set. My experience has been ruined and I don't even care to watch the program.",1396483200,,482,4.616279069767442

Extremely disappointed.  I only made it through 1.5 episodes, I was giving it the benefit of the doubt for as long as I could.  I can not believe this was picked up for a second season.",1396483200,3,379,4.1506849315068495

5550527,5,B00B18FA50,"Even though there's a little business story about the American who opened the first department store of its type in London in the early 1900's, there are a lot of personal stories going on about Mr. Selfridge and the rest of his staff.

We like period shows, so that was part of the draw.  But also, this one is just easy to watch, interesting without being overwhelming after a long day, and well, a little soapy.

Give it a try.  Only two seasons.",1396483200,,449,4.373493975903615

5550535,4,B00B18FA50,This is a good show to watch.  The drama keeps my wife and I interested.  I personally like Piven's cheesy grin as he sheds off adversity.

It is an entertaining period piece and a nice change from all the conspiracies and violence on shows like Scandal or Person of Interest. And being a latecomer to this series, it is nice to be able to watch all of season 1 on demand.",1396396800,,306,4.203389830508475
5550548,4,B00B18FA50,"The main character plays a masterful role walking the edge malevolence and benevolence. This show centers on the character Mr. Selfridge, so thankfully he carries this show well. I look forward to seeing how he handles the absence of those close to him; his one vulnerability. Perhaps the malevolent side to him will be humbled.",1396396800,,328,4.9818181818181815
5550549,3,B00B18FA50,"If it's just one actor that seems off, I blame the actor, but when the whole troup seems off, I think it's the director.  I never could get into the story, it seems like they can't decide if they are being camp, or trying (and failing) to play it straight.  Everyone seems like they are playing in grown-up clothing.s",1396396800,,317,4.3559322033898304

May try Upstairs Downstairs some day.  I sure this is very good, but the preview did not catch my interest on that day.  Maybe some other time.",1396396800,,321,4.372881355932203

5550552,5,B00B18FA50,"We were looking for something to fill in the very long period between seasons of Downton Abbey and were quite fortunate to find Mr. Selfridge.  Wonderfully acted, great drama and characters, and the added bonus of getting a little bit of history along the way. It is now our favorite drama (sorry Downton).",1396396800,,306,4.773584905660377
5550553,5,B00B18FA50,Lovely costume and scenery. Lively dialoge and delicious drama. It intrigued me enough to research the real Selfridge. Fascinating piece of history and how it affected marketing and retail today.,1396396800,,195,5.533333333333333

5550558,5,B00B18FA50,I hadn't seen the show when it was originally aired on TV but decided to watch it while home sick one day on my kindle fire.  I ended up watching the whole season in a day.  I fell in love with the characters.  Really enjoyed the way the story progressed.  My favorite - after Mr. Selfridge was Lady Mae (or it could be May).  Just the right amount of uppitidness and down-to-earth appeal to make her very enjoyable.  I look forward to seeing them all again next season.,1396396800,,470,4.284090909090909

The series has a lot of energy.",1396396800,,342,4.074626865671642

5550565,5,B00B18FA50,"At first, I wasn't sure this was a series I would be interested in watching, but after just watching the first episode, I was hooked.  It's a fascinating depiction of one man's application of his principles to become a magnate in a business venture while at the same time having to deal with his personal faults and emotional struggles.  The one thing I find fascinating is the interaction with his employees.  Jeremy Pivens does an fantastic job portraying a very strong minded individual who is in his realm when it comes to business.  The supporting cast is wonderful as well having just the right mix of characters.",1396396800,,619,4.757009345794392
5550566,4,B00B18FA50,Have only seen first 4 episodes and we find it entertaining. Interesting to see the risk people take to achieve success & who put everything on the line. Unlike those who want the others to provide for them.,1396396800,,207,4.473684210526316
5550567,5,B00B18FA50,Entertaining. Job well done by all. We really liked the history. We followed Mr. Selfridge online as we watched. Good Job people.,1396396800,,129,4.909090909090909
5550568,4,B00B18FA50,Love to see the fashion during the early 1900's.  There is also a new twist. Interesting to incorporate the moguls of department stores and the huge changes in women's roles at work and home,1396396800,,190,4.588235294117647
5550569,5,B00B18FA50,Watching it with hubby-he started in OZ and told me about it. Combo of Downton Abbey and The Paradise-but modeled after the true founder of Selfridge's in London. Great fun to watch.,1396396800,,182,4.71875

5550573,4,B00B18FA50,"Turn of the century soaps opera, but interesting and well done. Some modernization of terms and mannerisms but I guess that's needed for acceptance today.",1396396800,,154,5.2
5550574,4,B00B18FA50,A story line I never imagined could hold my interest.  It is a very intriguing true story woven with beautiful details from the era.,1396396800,,132,4.5

5550577,4,B00B18FA50,The show starts off a little slow. But once you've been into the series for three episodes it does start getting much better. I like the story line and the acting is pretty decent. It's a good way to break up the in between with the top series that masterpiece theater puts out. I have not finished the season up I will. The only thing that really agitates me is the singing and little shows the choir girl puts on. Seems very chinchy. Overall good late night show to watch. Just need to get past the first few episodes.,1396396800,,520,4.262626262626263
5550578,5,B00B18FA50,Outstanding and will definitely watch it again! Jeremy Piven is great and it's mostly historically accurate too.  Loved the way they portrayed the evolution of the department store in such a creative way.,1396396800,,204,5.181818181818182

5550581,4,B00B18FA50,Good stuff.  Tight script.  Easily outclasses that other PBS offering about the idle rich living in a massive old mansion.,1396396800,,122,5.05

5550585,3,B00B18FA50,Didn't care for the illicit affairs that were too prevalent in the story line.  Otherwise it was not too bad.,1396396800,,109,4.45
5550586,4,B00B18FA50,"Interesting plot from the first episode.  Jeremy Priven shines,and his eyes twinkle, as you see his character dream of creating a different type of emporium.

5550588,5,B00B18FA50,"I really enjoyed this series. Actually, I started watching it from the beginning on Saturday and watched every episode. I was ready for the second season to start on PBS on Sunday. I think Jeremy Piven is given a bad rap on playing Mr. Selfridge. I think he did a wonderful job, especially with his facial expressions. I gave it 5 stars because I got hooked and watched every episode (10 of them) in a row in one day.",1396310400,,417,4.291139240506329

5550590,5,B00B18FA50,I watched the entire season 1 again over the weekend to freshen my mind about it before the 1st episode of season 2 started on Sunday night.  I enjoyed it as much this time as I did a year ago when it ran the first time.  I do enjoy the British comedies and shows on PBS a great deal.,1396310400,,284,3.7966101694915255

5550595,5,B00B18FA50,"Love the characters, costumes, story.  Jeremy Piven is absolutely brilliant as Selfridge.  Aisling Loftus as Agnes will have you charmed and rooting for her ascendancy.  Don't miss this one!",1396310400,,190,5.482758620689655

5550601,1,B00B18FA50,"I did not watch all of Mr. Selfridge because of the sexual content that I found offensive.  There were several discussions and ""after the fact"" scenes concerning adultery that I did not like, but when there was an ""in the act"" scene I turned it off and did not continue to watch.  I am returning the DVD.  I have advised Amazon that they need to give a preview of what to expect with these unrated Masterpiece and BBC movies.
I realize that this review will not be popular with some, but I want my opinion to be known.",1396224000,7,518,4.26530612244898

Now, yes, I know, this isn't a true bio-pic, it's based on the novel and Selfridges life. Even so, this is a treat. The subplots are believable and everyone does an excellent job. One of my favorites is Selfridge's long suffering accountant, Mr. Crabb, played by Ron Cook. Brilliant.",1396224000,,378,4.921875

5550610,4,B00B18FA50,"I love this series. I love the costumes, sets, the actors but I especially love that the story line includes the happenings of the time. I didn't like the artist story line though - without doing into any detail, I thought it was creepy, stupid, and lazy (on the writer's part). If the artist's story line was more original, and less of a twisted fat old man's creepy fantasy, I would have given this series 5 stars.",1396137600,,416,4.415584415584416

Season 2 starts tonight and I can't wait.",1396137600,,264,5.1395348837209305

5550622,5,B00B18FA50,Nicely done turn of the century program.  Jeremy Piven is excellent in the starring role. The supporting cast is also wonderful. Takes you to an era that is totally different from the one we live in.,1396137600,,199,4.527777777777778
5550623,5,B00B18FA50,"Beautiful setting. Actors truly believable as they draw you in tog their world. Lead Selfridge captures the essence of the department store mogul. Any one who likes Downton Abbey, will like this series.",1396137600,,202,5.151515151515151
5550624,1,B00B18FA50,Jeremy Piven is just the worst actor. Couldn't even finish the first season. What a shame for the rest of the cast. Thought that I was the only one but it turns out I'm not alone in my feelings. Wish they could dump him and find a replacement for him. Replace him like Darren from 'Bewitched'! We could all just pretend it's the same Mr. Selfridge and move on. :),1396051200,2,363,4.2

5550630,4,B00B18FA50,"This rating should be 4-1/2 stars.  These British series are so well done!  Careful attention is paid to every production detail, and all the players are excellent. Jeremy Piven is outstanding in the title role. Set at the beginning of the twentieth century, this is the story of the upstart American founder of one of London's great department stores and of those around him.  The series has all the appeal of other period pieces aired on Public Television (such as UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTARS and DOWNTON ABBEY).  As with the earlier dramas, MR SELFRIDGE brilliantly depicts the interaction between and among members of different levels of society.  Here the main character is himself a social climber:  dynamic, boundlessly ambitious, seemingly indomitable, and--like all good protagonists--flawed.  I loved the first season so much that, streaming availability notwithstanding, I wanted the DVD version for my collection.  I am already enjoying Season Two and will eventually purchase that DVD, as well.",1396051200,,999,5.358974358974359

Actually, I started watching this show thinking it was going to be a comedy ..the department store setting reminded me of, ""Are You Being Served."" No, definitely not a comedy series..the goings on in the lives of the characters are painfully real and before I knew it, I was totally immersed. Jeremy Piven is absolutely riveting in this role. Don't be fooled for a minute by all his smiles..there's a deep, dark side to this man that Piven occasionally reveals through his amazing facial expression..no words are necessary! Are we to feel sorry for Harry Selfridge, or despise him? Please hurry with Season 2!",1395964800,,675,4.827586206896552

Mr. Selfridge's antics and his family life are very different , he tries to balance the two but he is so charasmatic with his mistress, wife and employees. It is fun to watch and I reccomend it . Jeremy Piven's acting is powerful making him a bold , loud boss running the biggest store . His take charge and take no for an answer makes him much like the character  that he played in Entourage. I am still watching season 1 and look forward to each one wondering what will be next for him, Rose his wife his family and of course Selfridge's department store and his employees ?",1395878400,,630,4.25

5550683,3,B00B18FA50,"For starters, I have avoided this series. I don't like Jeremy Piven and, despite the fact that I live in San Francisco, I don't like the Victorian era. I'm probably the only person in this town who loathes Victorian houses. That being said, PBS had a rerun of episode two on the other night and I watched it. Like nearly all BBC Productions, this one has attention to detail down to the nth degree. The costumes, sets and other ""physical"" aspects are outstanding. The story is pure fluff and the performances vary. The ladies are the strongest here. A number of their characters are interesting, if not particularly moving. I am reserving my judgement for Mr. Piven for season two. In the initial episodes, he is both over over the top and wooden, a disconcerting combination. He gets better, or at least his character does, after episode 4, when the plot lines are ramped up a bit. I've seen a lot of complaining on Amazon about the ""nothing happens here"". Well, it does. The plot lines revolve around human behavior and not car crashes, etc., though there is one. Many of things that I thought may be out of context, like automatic fire extinguishers, and cars able to go 50 mph, at this point in time, are actually accurate. As usual, BBC has done their research. This isn't Fox, after all. People also want to compare this to Downton Abbey, another series I was avoiding, but, this isn't the same. Downton is far more complicated with a lot more characters and better acting. Mr. Selfridge is mindless and pretty entertainment. Not great but, not bad. Season Two will tell if this series has gotten past it's growing pains and if Mr. Selfridge himself is not so odious. Love those one-star reviews who claim the series to be solely about adultery and sex. It is not and this series is no more trashy than any other currently on American television. In fact, it's much less trashy than any ""reality"" television that shows what ""real"" Americans are about. Grow up. Just because something advertises that it is ""Victorian"" does not mean that people didn't behave in this manner at the time. They just didn't flaunt it! On the plus side, I am interested in finding out about about the real Mr. Selfridge. Dollars to donuts, I'll bet that he had affairs. I hope that his real wife stood up to him, in real life, if he did. Sorry to give that plot line away, folks.",1395792000,,2363,4.588652482269503
5550684,5,B00B18FA50,Just wonderful. Keep the Masterpiece theater coming. I also like Masterpiece Downton Abby! That is also a great program. Great!!!,1395792000,,129,5.5
5550685,5,B00B18FA50,"Unfortunately, Priven has the lead role as Mr. Selfridge. He's woefully miscast and sometimes makes me cringe when I hear him delivering his lines or trying to display the appropriate emotion. Why this wasn't obvious to everyone associated with putting this series together (and then corrected) is perplexing. He may be fine in other roles, but not this one. He seems way too modern and non-nuanced and just plain wrong.

As for the rest of the cast: perfect. Ditto for the costumes, sets (a beautifully-recreated London of an earlier era), story, and sense of time and place. Luckily, all that makes up for the mistake of putting Mr. Piven in this show, no matter how jolting his acting may be.",1395792000,,695,4.791666666666667

5550693,5,B00B18FA50,Very entertaining. Jeremy Piven is a little odd with his acting. I don't know if that's just how he is as an actor or if he is this way for the role.

5550700,4,B00B18FA50,"Based on a cursory glance through the Wikipedia article about the real-world Selfridges, it appears that the store shown in this shown is historically accurate. If so, no wonder a show was made about this man and his store! He's brilliant and innovative. The show itself manages to capture his complexity as well, which I appreciate. More and more often we find that the most brilliant and creative individuals had complex and often turbulent personal lives. This show manages to capture that but still not depress us. Admittedly, I'm only 6/8 of the way through it, but I expect that this is an accurate representation.

The only complaint I have is that there is only one season of the show to watch currently! But I saw on Wiki that Season 2 is currently airing in England and the show will be putting on a third season as well (with potentially more to follow). Huzzah!

Note: the only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel that, at times, the show is a bit predictable. On the bright side though, at least it doesn't talk down to viewers.",1395705600,,1057,4.528795811518324

Not exactly the stuff of great drama though the Masterpiece folks did their best to spice it up with scandal, poor little match girl, and threatened financial ruin.",1395705600,,268,4.955555555555556
5550705,3,B00B18FA50,"This series is very well done.  The period settings and costumes are lovely.  The acting is good.  Jeremy Piven is, as always,  wonderful.  However, in my opinion, the story line is weak, or the writing is lacking.  One never does get as invested in the characters as one would like.  The characters are a little too one-dimensional and predictable.  Still, an enjoyable series; just does not quite live up to the big production.",1395705600,,429,4.780821917808219
5550706,5,B00B18FA50,I love this show! You are always waiting for a new twist. Jeremy Pevins does a great job with his role as Mr. Selfridge.,1395705600,,120,4.041666666666667
5550707,5,B00B18FA50,"I enjoyed Mr. Selfridge as much as Downton Abbey. It would be AMAZING if the producers of Mr. Selfridge could acquire the cast of Downton Abbey for one episode. Of course, it would be a flashback for Downton and all the dead characters could be used !!",1395705600,,252,4.382978723404255

5550713,4,B00B18FA50,"As a Downtown Abbey fan I was pleased to find Mr. Selfridge.  The soap-opera in London Department store, started by an American, is enjoyable and engaging.  Some of the plot situation seemed contrived, as when various people arrive on the scene to move the story along.  Some scenes lack the number of people who should be present.  You would expect to see more people at meetings and at certain events are depicted.  Great cast, well acted.",1395705600,,441,4.75

It is very entertaining and the characters are well cast and well developed.  Love the period sets and wardrobe.  And the story never quite goes where you think it will and always leaves you waiting eagerly to find out what happens next.",1395705600,,396,4.383561643835616
5550724,5,B00B18FA50,Loved this show!  What a great season;  loved the set and the costumes.  Does Rose always wear white/beige?

5550729,5,B00B18FA50,"Those Brits know a great storyline! I never heard of this show series and took a chance on watching the 1st episode. Oh my gosh! I was hooked. I am a dedicated Downton Abbey fan but they have so few episodes. Mr Selfridge season has plenty of episodes to give me longer lasting entertainment. But when I got to the last one I was still ready for more.....and alas the second season has not even started yet. There are plenty of storylines here and love the department store setting, too. Watch one episode and you will love it!!",1395705600,,528,4.3979591836734695

5550746,4,B00B18FA50,"We enjoyed this show -- especially the UK Edition. By the time the US does its editing for TV, the story line is bumpy and leaves you wondering what happened. Love having our own copy of this UK Edition. Well done.",1395532800,,214,4.2439024390243905

5550748,4,B00B18FA50,Ratings are always difficult but when it comes to British films I probably am a bit partial. Watching Masterpiece Theatre almost equates to a night at the theatre. The productions are so well orchestrated on so many levels. Mr. Selfridge continues the grand tradition and artistry of Masterpiece theatre and absolutely does not disappoint!,1395446400,,339,5.296296296296297

5550751,5,B00B18FA50,"This is a very interesting series focusing on how shopping got its start in London.  I'm a fan of Downton Abbey and I'm now hooked on this, also!  It seems that we are going back to the way things used to be before going to the stores to shop became popular.  I'm sure Amazon wants to know that shopping online is my preferred way to shop instead of going to the department stores or malls!",1395446400,,390,4.173333333333333

5550758,5,B00B18FA50,I love the time frame on this series. I think the choice of actors was right on.  I thoroughly enoy watching this series.

5550760,5,B00B18FA50,"Beautiful costume-drama escapism. The tone is a little more exuberant and fast-paced than your typical period piece, and the ensemble cast does a good job of getting you invested in the different stories of the characters. Sometimes the script is a little ham-fisted, and personally, I think Jeremy Piven was a weird casting choice. But that hasn't stopped me from enjoying this series overall, and eagerly anticipating the Season 2!",1395446400,,433,5.2
5550761,5,B00B18FA50,"This show is very entertaining.  Mr. Selfridge is a show that takes you back to an earlier time that is very intriguing.

5550767,5,B00B18FA50,"This series is so amazing, I stayed up until 3 AM one weekend just to finish watching the first season! The ups and downs of the lives of Mr. Selfridge himself (who, it turns out, cheats on his lovely wife), his employees and his family, will truly keep the viewer coming back for more! I do hope, with all sincerity, that this series will continue, as I was sad not to yet see a season 2. Hopefully it is being filmed as I speak here! Just lovely to watch; the period of England in those days was really eye-opening. The women's movement to vote, the dresses, the men's suits, so very becoming to the physique!

It takes a while for the characters to develop, in classic English style, but develop they do.

5550789,4,B00B18FA50,"We have enjoyed watching these past episodes of this series to see if we want to watch it this season. So far we are enjoying it okay. Not as good as Downton Abby, so can't compare. Watch it and make your own decision.",1395273600,,218,4.093023255813954
5550790,5,B00B18FA50,"I love stories that take place in the early 1900.s.  There are many facets to Mr. Selfridge.  He's a good businessman, loves his wife and children, but doesn't always make the right decisions.  It will be intriguing to see how he unravelling escapades in season 2.",1395273600,,264,4.695652173913044
5550791,5,B00B18FA50,I watched the first season over a two week period and found each episode very entertaining; I highly recommend it.  My family and I are anticipating the start of the new season.,1395273600,,177,4.53125
5550792,5,B00B18FA50,"Love everything about the telling of this story of the rise of contemproary department stores is so interesting, well acted and beautiful.",1395273600,,138,5.318181818181818
5550793,3,B00B18FA50,"As with most multi-part series, Mr. Selfridge--a chronicle of high-end retailing in early 20th century London--gets off to a slow start in Episode 1 as characters and situations are introduced.  Things pick up in subsequent episodes, but the series never seems to hit a steady stride as gripping episodes frequently alternate with ones that are just average.  Typical of UK-produced period pieces, the production values are outstanding and the acting is first rate with one glaring exception.  Jeremy Piven's performance as Selfridge is rather uneven.  Too often he seems to be declaiming his lines rather than naturally acting the part, yet in other scenes he successfully conveys the humanity of a very complex character.  The chief turn-off for me with this series is that very few of the significant characters are thoroughly likeable.  The vast majority of the principles, from Selfridge on down to the lowliest shop girl, are on the make, always with an eye to the main chance and many of them quite willing to engage in morally or ethically questionable behavior as long as there is a quid pro quo involved that will advance their personal agenda.  What's worse, the characters who don't fit this mold all seem to be set up to be losers in the long run.  So jaundiced a view of human nature detracts from my enjoyment of a series that is frankly a stylish soap opera with juicy plot lines and nice period flavor.  Despite Season 1's failure to totally grab me, I'll be tuning in to Season 2 when it airs on PBS.  Anyone who enjoys multi-part British costumes dramas should find Mr. Selfridge, Season 1 at least moderately entertaining.",1395273600,,1642,4.874100719424461
5550794,5,B00B18FA50,Outstanding ensemble work. Super sad last episode. What will Harry do?? Wonderful to learn a little background of a place where I have shopped.,1395273600,,143,5.0
5550795,3,B00B18FA50,"This is a vehicle for Jeremy Piven and his method of acting/characterization. If you really like Jeremy Piven this will be great. Or, if you like shows with great costuming as the main vehicle for the piece. I watch it while I work out and so it does not have to be fantastic but mildly entertaining while I expend calories in relatively useless physical work.",1395273600,,360,4.553846153846154
5550796,5,B00B18FA50,"Priven is very interesting as Selfridge. At first the accent and tone in voice can be off putting but by the end of Season 1, I understand why he did it. This is the first series I have seen from this time period that takes the time to good deep into the female characters. My favorite is Lady May. I appreciate how hard it was to develop this character and keep the viewer guessing ""what's next?."" Give us Season 2 PLEASE!",1395273600,,423,4.234567901234568

5550802,5,B00B18FA50,"Entertaining, fun, and the acting is superb. I'm a Downton Abby fan, and I liked this show just as much, if not more than Downton. Can't wait for Season 2.",1395273600,,155,4.2
5550803,5,B00B18FA50,I love Masterpiece Classics - and this is a great way to watch them.  Mr. Selfridge is like good junk food - just gotta have it...and you really don't know whether to like HIM or not...looking forward to season 2,1395273600,,212,4.3

5550808,5,B00B18FA50,From the premise of the first department store in this era to each individual character in this drama- Mr Selfridge captures the viewer and doesn'tlet her go. Plots and subplots abound - with fun and tears and imagination.,1395273600,,222,4.868421052631579
5550809,5,B00B18FA50,"Called Jeremy Piven ""leaden"" and ""without fire""?  I couldn't disagree more!  I thought he was one of the most dynamic and interesting actors / characters I've seen in a long time.  Every time he comes on the scene he is just riveting.

The acting and scripts are first-rate.  The characters are real - very flawed, driven by their egos and emotions.  Agnes the young clerk is just stunning, and a sympathetic character.  Bravo!  Can't wait to see the next season.",1395187200,,463,4.7
5550810,5,B00B18FA50,"I found Mr. Selfridge similar to The Paradise.  The costumes and sets of Mr. Selfridge are quite impressive, and add quite a bit to the program.  Wonderful acting.  Fascinating that the program follows the story of the real Mr. Selfridge.  My almost 90 year old mother in law grew up outside London and remembers the annual trip into Selfridges to buy school uniforms.  Though some of the self destructive behavior of Mr. Selfridge and the consequences teeters on melodrama, I'm looking forward to the upcoming season.  Am hoping that the other characters (really enjoy watching Agnes Towler evolve) continue to contribute to the story.",1395187200,,636,5.0673076923076925
5550811,5,B00B18FA50,"I liked it and cannot wait for the new season. Americans are always portrayed as too loud, too rich, too arrogant when in other countries, and Mr. Selfridge is all of that, but he is also very human. He overcomes his flaws with confidence.",1395187200,,239,4.454545454545454
5550812,5,B00B18FA50,"I stumbled upon this series while closing out the latest season of Downton Abbey.  I was elated to learn that I could watch it here on Amazon instead of fiddling with the sometime-ish clarity of another site.  I was able to binge watch in time to get ready for the release of season 2 in another week or so.

This series is entertaining and inspiring.  I admire Mr. Selfridge as a visionary and trailblazer; even with his faults and frailties.  I like period films and shows, so this had me hooked at second one!  You will enjoy the show and the talented cast and writers that make the storyline come alive.",1395187200,,607,4.423423423423423

5550819,2,B00B18FA50,"Same period as Downton Abbey.  Similar class structure.  Wealthy american man with rich american family. Poor english girl with broken family.  Lots of opportunity for intrigue. It could have worked and probably should have worked.

And it fails because there is no plot.  Just a lot of stereotypes tossed into the hat:  Brash american determines to topple british merchant stodgery.  Brash american falls for gaiety girl.  Brash american's classier wife falls for struggling painter.  Plucky english girl works hard.  Plucky english girl holds family together. Plucky english girl falls for exotic frenchman.

select 3 - 5 for use in episode 1, return them to hat
select 3 - 5 for use in episode 2, repeat

why bother?",1395187200,,719,5.051282051282051

The writing is excellent, which is the key to great drama for me.  Jeremy Piven rocks it--his Selfridge is like Ari Gold crossed with Marshall Field!  You become quite invested in the characters and cannot wait for the next installment.  Also:  I didn't know that Selfridge was such a bold and innovative thinker who set the stage for the modern customer service paradigm of the high end department store, such as Nordstrom or Saks.",1395187200,,578,4.917525773195877

5550829,5,B00B18FA50,"This show is a hidden gem that I want to share with the world! I found it accidentally, when I was wanting to find the first episode of Downton Abbey on the PBS channel of my Roku player. Both shows start with the ""Masterpiece"" title. I saw a preview of this show and completely forgot about Downton Abbey! Unfortunately, PBS only posted the first few episodes of Season 1 on its Roku channel, so I was elated to see that Amazon Prime had the entire first season!

The show takes place in London in the early 1900's and is centered around the new department store, Selfridge's. It is really neat to see the evolution of shopping and watching how things that are commonplace now first became introduced. The fashion is also very interesting. The characters are very well developed and complex, as are their relationships. This is one show that I can't say is predictable!",1395100800,,870,4.612903225806452

5550831,2,B00B18FA50,I think the actor playing Mr. Selfridge is not believable in this part. He seems as though he is walking through the scenes and is saying his lines but just isn't believable in his part. The story is great and all the others are good  but I just don't enjoy it because of that one actor and sorryly he has the main part.,1395100800,7,320,4.079365079365079

This show has a number of interesting twists: some predictable, some surprising.

Jeremy Piven's acting is a little over the top at first, but you begin to realize this is necessary in order to understand the complexity of this character. I am  more interested in the daily lives of the every day working class characters. An intimate glimpse of what it would be like to live in early 1900's.

I was hesitant at first, given that some of Piven's most timeless roles for me have been more character actor-like, with tons of humor, and I wasn't sure how he would fit into a mostly British costume drama, but he is downright charming and poignant in this series, showing just how great and diverse an actor he really is. The entire cast is phenomenal, with engaging characters coming from the least likely origins. Give it a try.

An American business man in London, Mr. Selfridge shows what the best and worst of an American wanting to build an empire can do. In the background of the workings of a large department store ladies are trying to get the vote, romance is thriving, hearts are broken, and secrets are kept and found out. The series is full of the intrigues of the royals all the way down to the loading dock workers.  It is a fascinating look into the workings of a large store and the lives of the people who work and shop there. Great writing and character development will keep you watching one episode after another.",1394755200,,705,4.543307086614173

It's flaw in our (my wife and I) opinion is that it descends into more of a soap opera with lurid sexual liaisons displayed on the screen. This, in our experience, is somewhat uncharacteristic for British television and very unfortunate. It is why we stopped watching and will not return.",1394668800,,430,4.671052631578948

Watched half of season 1 when it originally aired on PBS then gave up.

All of the actors and actresses in this series do a splendid job with the exception of Jeremy Piven, the lead character. However, his acting (overacting) is so entertaining, it brings humor in spots where humor is not expected. The rest of the cast and the storyline is superb. My 21-year-old daughter and I love watching this show together. The presentation of early 20th-century shopping, fashion, and customs is educational, and Piven's high-schoolish acting lightens the usual serious storylines, bringing even more entertainment where it isn't expected.",1394668800,,634,5.287128712871287

5550944,5,B00B18FA50,"There is something so entertaining about seeing a brash American take sedate, uptight London by storm with his new concept of shopping with the opening of his store, Selfridges. The intertwined stories of the lives of his staff, from the lowliest stock boy to upper management have made for an intriguing, delightful and excellently told story about the inner workings of Harry Selfridge's store and of course, there is the story of Harry Selfridge himself. A family man who loves his wife and kids deeply but is not immune to the charms of the opposite sex - which invariably lead to a strain in his marriage and his wife and mother returning to the States. Harry is bereft without his family but the store is his main priority if he is to keep afloat in the cutthroat world of London business. The acting is excellent with Jeremy Piven heading up a stellar cast, as Harry Selfridge. The stories and plottings, intrigues and affairs are enough to have you longing for more and wishing these seasons were far longer!

5550945,5,B00B18FA50,"What a wonderful variety Masterpiece offers to continually renew itself!  The Yankee influence, boldness versus innocence.  A celebration of adult wonder and connivance -- and its good and bad affects.  It is so exciting to see a seasoned American actor take his place in acting royalty on both continents.  The rest of the cast is excellent, but it is called Mr. Selfridge (brilliant play on words) for a reason.

It hasn't been. Selfridge did it, and this is his story... as imagined by screenwriter Andrew Davies also responsible for the 1995 Pride and Prejudice.

5550950,4,B00B18FA50,"""Downton Abby"" fans, this might help tide you over a bit. This costume drama is built along similar lines. But unlike ""Downton,"" because a primary character is an American, they don't try to hide the Americanization aspects here. Pacing is a bit faster, conflicts are more dynamic and dialog is a bit more overlapping. But it is a fun show, and it will cause you to research the real Mr. Selfridge, who truly seemed to be a character worth dramatizing.",1394582400,,452,4.6625

Someone tries telling you, the prospective Mr. Selfridge fan, that you're watching a ""soap opera""? Wrong. It's set in the past, so you're actually watching, and learning about, ""history"". The kind of history that really matters, populated by reliable stereotypes -- saucy showgirls, French sophisticates, dissolute nobility, honest working-class folk -- and featuring plenty of adultery, megalomania, and big hair styles. Jeremy Piven is terrific, reliably chewing the scenery in almost every frame. Other fun performances abound. The actress who plays Selfridge's wealthy patron, Lady May, never wipes the smirk off her face, nor should she. Season One closes on a high note, with a play in which Harry Selfridge gets what's coming to him. What's coming to you is top-notch entertainment.

It was cast very well and the set was put together with such amazing detail that you could probably watch the season all over again and find new and interesting things that you didn't see the first time. This program is about the begining of retail shopping and the idea of customer service being at the forefront of a retail experience.... that and the lively character that came up with the idea and took a big chance on a idea. Mr. Selfridge was a real showman.  I imagine some of the show is made up with lots of real history intertwined inside its storyline. I will be waiting for season 2.",1394582400,,660,4.409836065573771

His performance is borderline amateurish, and I'm totally surprised that with all the talent out there he managed to win this role.  As for the overall show, like most Masterpiece pieces, it beats anything on  American TV.  At least we're not subjected to vile language and inane humor.  However, there is too much ""ambient noise"" making it difficult for an American trained ear to fully catch the dialogue, often making watching a bit painful.",1394409600,,512,4.839080459770115

5550988,4,B00B18FA50,"Overall, I did really like the series. I did find Pivens to be a bit wooden in his performance, and was unsure if that was supposed to be the actual character flaw or if that was just Pivens being Pivens. I liked how the stories of the characters' lives were interwoven, and it all seemed very seamless. The season finale felt bit overstretched with so much going so wrong so quickly, but you have to set up redemption for Season 2, which I do look forward to.",1394409600,,460,4.2988505747126435

It's eerily similar to The Paradise, another Masterpiece Classic centered around a department store. Jeremy Piven is embarrassingly bad as Mr. Selfridge--his acting is on a community theater level. The writing is trite, which is a surprise because much of it was written by the wonderful Andrew Davies.

Unfortunately, my schedule doesn't often allow me the opportunity to tune in each Sunday evening.  I am delighted that Amazon Prime is making many series from this program available so I can ""catch up.""
I didn't know what to expect from Mr. Selfridge, when I started watching.  I wasn't sure how a very American (in my mind) actor such as Jeremy Piven (Entourage's Ari Gold) would fit into this very Victorian story.  Turns out, pretty well.  The series has many characters, each with his/her own backstory that intersect continually.  This series is very much like a retail-version of the original ""Upstairs/Downstairs.""

5551018,3,B00B18FA50,"I loved the recreation of the period--costumes, furnishings, all of it. No one recreates their own historical past as well as the British. Unfortunately, I thought the actor playing Selfridge was flat-out not believable, much less good in the role. He came across more like a standup comedian than an actor--all cheek and bombast, no nuances of feeling or understanding. I rarely see any program or movie where I cannot ""suspend disbelief,"" as they say, and feel a part of what's going on in the story. With ""Mr. S,"" I never believed any of it for a minute whenever this actor was onscreen. Perhaps he's very good in other roles; I see he's won at least one award for his work. But this was not the right role for him. Incidentally, there's another example of this type of disastrous miscasting on Masterpiece Theatre: the actress who played Irene in the early-oughts version of The Forsyte Saga. She didn't look the part (in fact, is very witchy-looking), was too tall, acted in near-monotone throughout--in short, she was so wrong for the part that, again, I couldn't get into the story because her presence was so distracting. The Irene actress in the late-sixties Forsyte Saga version was perfect, and of course the story is riveting. Thanks for listening.",1394236800,,1260,4.837962962962963

5551021,5,B00B18FA50,Looking forward to the second season. It was interesting to see where the foundation of our department stores and how we shop started.,1394236800,,134,4.869565217391305
5551022,5,B00B18FA50,"The rags to riches storyline, the clothes, the accents, cobblestones, window displays all worth watching!!
I'm wondering how WWI will play into the show.",1394236800,,153,5.416666666666667
5551023,3,B00B18FA50,"I became hooked on the PBS series ""Paradise"" which was about the development of the first 'department' store and the characters surrounding it.  I couldn't wait for the next recording and found myself only watching when i could be alone & comfortably without distractions as I became absorbed in the characters and their conversations.

SO far, this is not what I am finding with Mr. Selfridge.  But, since it's Masterpiece, I'm going to give it another try.",1394236800,,458,4.922077922077922
5551024,4,B00B18FA50,"I love period pieces!  It's so interesting to learn about the ""rules"" that were in place during these times - dress, decoram, roles of women, etc...  The character are well thought out and believable enough to become invested.",1394236800,,226,4.921052631578948
5551025,4,B00B18FA50,"Ladies will love this show. It is a great mix of fashion shopping and gossip. What's not to like
Jeremy Piven's character is charming , handsome and a great salesman. He puts a positive spin on everything to do with shopping and brings in famous people to entertain his customers. Mr. Selfridge was clearly a marketing genious and way ahead of the curve.",1394236800,,354,4.634920634920635
5551026,5,B00B18FA50,Love the period of the time and the human interest of the story.. Very much looking forward to 2nd season.,1394236800,,106,4.35

5551028,5,B00B18FA50,Loved this series. Can't wait to see Season 2! It's interesting to see how Mr. Selfridge's ideas are still reflected in today's department stores.,1394150400,,146,5.125
5551029,4,B00B18FA50,"If you love Downton Abbey, you will love Mr. Selfridge.  I enjoy the scenes and period clothing.  Can't wait to head to London and to Selfridges.",1394150400,,145,4.538461538461538
5551030,4,B00B18FA50,"I finally got smart and put my MAC all in one in my Kitchen. My husband and i enjoy watching Mr. Selfridge as we eat dinner. The light banter, easy laughter and beautiful costuming makes it easy to eat and not get indigestion!! The only complaint I have is not with the show but with Amazon and having to navigate the site until I eventually stumble across the shows I'm looking for.",1394150400,,383,4.333333333333333
5551031,4,B00B18FA50,"It's clear from the beginning that this show is going to be high energy with lots of subplots and adventure.  It really gives you an appreciation for the behind the scenes life of a large, aggressive retail environment.  Harry Selfridge is out to make his store the envy of the planet.  Unfortunately, it's clear as Season One progresses that this will come at great price to his family, his ""friends,"" his creditors, his employees, and ultimately to Harry himself.  A tour de force.  Lavish costuming, a high pace story line, and a grand mixture of characters all make Mr. Selfridge a ""must see.""",1394150400,,597,4.757281553398058
5551032,5,B00B18FA50,"I enjoyed Season 1 and look forward to Season 2 coming out soon on PBS.
It is worth the time to check it out.",1394150400,,109,3.5833333333333335
5551033,5,B00B18FA50,Loved it! Watched the entire season in 2 days. It's just like reading one of these great books that you can't put down.,1394150400,,119,4.217391304347826
5551034,5,B00B18FA50,"If you like Downton, you'll love this!  Transport yourself to early 20th century London with this based on reality drama.",1394150400,,121,5.05
5551035,3,B00B18FA50,I'm hoping it will get better when the characters develop more.  Now it's just OK.  Nothing has really happen that would draw you back.,1394150400,,135,4.583333333333333
5551036,3,B00B18FA50,"I have watched every episode of Downton Abbey so was looking for something to fill my need for a good old English story.  After the first episode of Mr. Selfridge, it seems a little more shallow, sometimes a bit flippant compared to Downton but....  it is entertaining, not at all objectionable so I will probably watch the rest of the season.  If you are looking for something light just to kill a little time, this is perfectly fine.  It just didn't make me want to ignore work, laundry and cooking to curl up with my iPad and watch every episode back to back.  A pleasant distraction but not an addictive passion.",1394150400,,616,4.513513513513513
5551037,4,B00B18FA50,"I really enjoyed this program.  It is a great period piece about a great mastermind behind department stores.  If you enjoy programs like Downton Abbey, you will enjoy this show.  Looking forward to watching season 2.",1394150400,,217,4.972222222222222
5551038,5,B00B18FA50,Pretty good drama that kept moving at a pretty6 decent pace. Something different but worth watching. Great acting and enjoyed the costumes cand props.,1394150400,,150,5.291666666666667

5551041,4,B00B18FA50,"This show is wonderful. The characters are interesting and varied, costumes are perfect, and the glimpse back in time is fascinating. It's not Downton Abbey, but it's excellent.",1394064000,,177,5.357142857142857
5551042,5,B00B18FA50,The American and British actors in it are marvelous. It takes place in the late 1800's so the costumes and set designs are wonderful.  It is an adult-oriented series because of the plot involving the characters. You do have the watch the series from the first episode because the plot continues from one episode to the next. I would highly recommend this series.,1394064000,,362,4.746031746031746
5551043,5,B00B18FA50,Love this show all the more so because it is based on a true story.  The characters are very well developed!1,1394064000,,109,4.190476190476191

5551045,4,B00B18FA50,"I hesitated to start watching this show because I am not a huge fan of Jeremy Piven's character on Entourage (not entirely logical but, it's the truth). Piven exceeded my expectations with his performance. I have enjoyed this historical drama and I'm glad that while it is hard to watch the way women were treated at that point in time, that there is coverage of the women's' suffrage movement as well.",1394064000,,402,4.676056338028169
5551046,5,B00B18FA50,Just loved the show. Can't wait to see more.  The period that this takes place in and the social classes that are involved; do a justice.,1394064000,,137,4.269230769230769
5551047,5,B00B18FA50,We love the show and it's ensemble cast.  The thought of revisiting the past and glimpsing into the lifestyles of the rich and famous is fascinating .,1394064000,,150,4.555555555555555
5551048,5,B00B18FA50,"I missed this while it was on PBS and since I loved ""The Paradise"" I thought I might give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. I thought the cast was great and the storyline also. I'll be watching Season 2 when it starts up.",1394064000,,219,4.0

Same old same old.
People with no morals.
We will not be watching this show any more.",1394064000,6,107,4.4
5551050,5,B00B18FA50,Once we started watching season 1 shows it was hard not to do the whole season in one day.  Great entertainment.  Thanks for including this series in the Amazon Prime offerings.,1394064000,,177,4.67741935483871
5551051,5,B00B18FA50,Jeremy proven is amazing as Mr Selfridge! He was great in Entourage and he brings this character to life! Great story- great performances!,1394064000,,138,5.043478260869565
5551052,3,B00B18FA50,"I started watching this hoping it would be as enthralling as Downton Abbey.  It's not as good, and the acting of some of the characters leaves isn't very convincing.  But I've only seen a couple episodes so I'll watch it a few more times and hope that it gets better.",1394064000,,267,4.32
5551053,4,B00B18FA50,I love the setries....yet the guy who plays Selfridge and his oldest daughter are horrible actors!!  Awful acting is not acceptable.,1394064000,,132,5.285714285714286

5551059,5,B00B18FA50,I love Jeremy Pivens. He's plays a great character you love but hate at the same time. The historical mix with drama is captivating.,1394064000,,132,4.541666666666667
5551060,4,B00B18FA50,A clear different way of thinking from Downton Abby.  A look into the minds and mores of the common people.,1394064000,,107,4.35

5551062,5,B00B18FA50,"I adore historic pieces and this series is exceptional. Set in early 20th century London the set designs, costumes and characters transport me to a time and place of tremendous interest.  The world is changing faster than ever and Mr. Selfridge's outlandish ingenuity in the formerly stodgy retail business is taking London by storm.  A poignant look behind the scenes of the ultimate department store and the lives of characters who sweep the floors, dress the window displays and serve the Tearoom meals will engage and entertain.",1394064000,,532,5.103448275862069

5551066,4,B00B18FA50,"I am halfway through season one of Mr. Selfridge starring the great Jeremy Piven of Entourage fame. Selfridge is a fascinating period piece about the real life retail magnate. They have a great cast of actors with very compelling storylines. This is such a fascinating period piece in part because it is amazing to see the many innovations that Selfridge employed in getting customers into his store and to spend, spend, spend. Many of these tactics are used in major department stores to this day. Another great quality television show from our friends across the pond.",1393977600,,570,4.947916666666667

I've only watched the first episode, but I'm already plotting to carve out some time to enjoy the second.  Not quite ""Downton Abbey"" (yet), but I can already see some interesting characters and wonderful acting coming into play.  Set in 1909 London, it tells the story of an American businessman who builds the first department store in London, determined to teach the upper-class how to enjoy shopping.

5551082,3,B00B18FA50,Mr. Selfridge was just average to me.  Very predictable.  I liked the language and sexual content was not offensive.  Hard to find shows without foul language and sexual situations that are offensive to some of us.  Thanks for that.,1393891200,,232,4.871794871794871

There are several story lines going on at the same time.  The main character is a likeable man, but not perfect.  You meet other
characters and are introduced to what's going on in their lives.

It makes you want to see the next episode!",1393891200,,382,4.4

5551092,4,B00B18FA50,He is a retailer that goes to London to open a store? The story moves forward and you see his success as the leader of a major store in London. He is a bit of a scoundrel.,1393891200,,171,3.6486486486486487

He shocks and offends London with his loud, brash, ""American"" ways yet finds ways to win them over with his genuine enthusiasm.  The story also has an upstairs/downstairs element with the department store staff's stories intertwined.  Very good, very entertaining show!",1393804800,,396,5.677966101694915

5551113,5,B00B18FA50,I loved the first season of Selfridge. It takes a minute to get used to Jeremy Piven's over-the-top personality at Mr. Selfridge - but after realizing that manic is the shield - I started to relate to the character. Excited to see season 2.,1393718400,,240,4.4772727272727275
5551114,5,B00B18FA50,This series follows the winning formula of making the main character a rich underdog who could lose is all.  Masterpiece does it again.,1393718400,,135,4.869565217391305

They are smart in some ways and a true idiot in others. Mr. Selfridge brings great storytelling and good cinematography together and presents it in one sumptuous feast.

This man, Selfridge, actually existed and (by all accounts) was every bit the dare devil character he's portrayed as in the series. Jeremy Piven is amazing. The costumes are beautiful.

5551133,5,B00B18FA50,"Loved it. It's set in a similar time as Downton, but it's completely different. It's fascinating to see the evolution of the department store. Jeremy Piven is phenomenal at depicting the successful tycoon as well as the man's internal turmoil and struggle to do right by his family. The many layers (and Piven's superb acting) draw you into his character and allow you to feel the highs & lows right along with him.",1393632000,,415,4.698630136986301

5551142,4,B00B18FA50,"An entertaining show offering a greatly dramatized view of the life of Henry Selfridge. The sets and period costumes are fantastic and overall the acting well above par, though Jeremy Piven's expressions and acting are a bit over the top and becoming predictably repetitive.

Mr. Piven could make his characterization of Selfridge more believable if he performed with the subtlety and feeling of Aisling Loftus in her role of Agnes Towler, one of many other character actors like Frances O'Connor (Mrs. Selfridge) and Ron Cook (Mr. Crabb)  that elevate this production to near classic levels.

If only Mr. Piven would tone down the overacting a few notches I might have given 5 stars",1393545600,,683,5.0265486725663715
5551143,5,B00B18FA50,"Normally, I don't care for this lead actor.  However, the overall story line along with the excellent support staff make this a thoroughly enjoying performance, and he works very well in this role of a shrewd, intelligent, and flawed character.  Very good directing.  Telling a tale with historical interest as well as interesting portrayal of human psychology and motivations.",1393545600,,377,5.3559322033898304

5551147,3,B00B18FA50,"Mr. Selfridge is a BBC period drama set in 1908 London and follows the rise of the department store in Britain.  Up until this point, shops were places that kept the merchandise behind the counters and a clerk would assist you in getting what you are looking for.  This all changed with the opening of Selfridge's department store.  Now, products are displayed and patrons can touch the objects before buying.  Add to this a more forward form of advertising and objectifying of women, you can see how this might ruffle the feathers of the traditional London upper class.

Jeremy Piven is a likable person in the title role - a man who is trying to balance a family and the pressures of a new business venture.  He is definitely a ""fish out of water"" as his American, self-made man ideals clash with established British society.  The world is changing and the battle of old money versus new is on the front lines.

The problem I have with the writing is that it seems to fall into the same old story lines that we are constantly fed when watching period dramas.  We are supposed to be shocked at the antiquated values of the society at that time while cheering on the ""plucky"" heroes/heroines who are bucking the system with ideals closer to a modern sensibility.  I just didn't care much about the side stories and people's reactions just didn't seem true from scene to scene.  It just seemed that the show was too busy trying to make a point rather than create characters who are part of a good story.

Overall, it isn't horrible.  I love period dramas and it is a good filler until I can have Downton Abbey again.",1393545600,,1615,4.527586206896552
5551148,5,B00B18FA50,"Masterpiece has done it again, they've produced another great period drama. This time about Selfridge, founder of one the largest department stores in London.

5551151,5,B00B18FA50,I liked this well acted interesting series. Jeremy Piven was very convincing as the real life first department store owner in England. The supporting cast was great as well. I am anxious to see how season 2 unravels.,1393459200,,216,4.7105263157894735

5551153,5,B00B18FA50,"Simply addicting! I watched and loved The Paradise Season one, and Season 2 was not yet available, so I began watching Mr. Selfridge to get my fix of British period shows.  I started watching this with low expectations, thinking it wouldn't be nearly as good as the paradise.  It is! In fact I think its better! It has a flow and rhythm. The writing and acting is spectacular and there is a bit more ""bite"" to this then the usual Masterpiece theatre presentation. Little bit sexier folks!",1393459200,,488,4.597701149425287

5551159,4,B00B18FA50,"Good series, mostly accurate historically except that the Selfridges building is 1930s architecture, but everything else (autos, women's hairstyles and clothing, etc.) is 1910-ish.  So I have a hard time knowing exactly what period it is set in.  But all the actors except the lead are excellent.  The lead (Mr. Selfridge) doesn't quite pull it off.  Still, worth watching for everyone else's acting, the costumes, good narrative story line, and just plain interesting!",1393459200,,469,5.383561643835616
5551160,4,B00B18FA50,"I loved this show.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's not Downton Abbey.  I know, that a pretty crappy reason to downgrade Mr. Selfridge's rating.

This program is another on a long list of why I don't bother with American television anymore.  The Brits have got it right.  The storyline is fantastic and engaging.  The acting is fantastic.  They spare no expense with costume and location.  I am looking forward to Season 2 on PBS March 30th 9:00 pm EST.",1393459200,,432,4.693333333333333

Was great fun looking and remembering how it felt to be there and attracting people to the merchandise.  Buying was a lot more fun in those days and we all worked at making the shopping exciting.

5551189,5,B00B18FA50,"On a whim I started watching Mr. Selfridge. Wow. The plots, the character build ups, the British superb acting has me mesmerized. The time period seems to be right on. Having Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (writer of Sherlock Holmes) on this last episode was a plus. Watching Mr Selfridge exude confidence and gathering contacts in order to build his huge department store was a treat in itself. Each character was slowly built up to the point I knew them very well. I can't say enough of this fantastic series and I am hooked watching them on Amazon..",1393372800,,544,4.618556701030927

5551195,5,B00B18FA50,"I really enjoyed watching the series--the actors do a very good job showing how events impact them and change their lives.  The character of Mr Selfridge is well played by Jeremy Piven.

I have been very surprised to see all the comparisons between Downton Abbey and Mr Selfridge.  True, they are both set in the same time period and both have stories involving a wide spectrum of society but to me they seem dissimilar in every other way.  Mr Selfridge is a striving, pushy, over the top Yank in turn-of-the-century London while Downton Abbey is primarily focused on one titled family and their various family, friends, and employees.

Mr Selfridge is a self absorbed, powerful man who is always looking for an opportunity.  I think it is fun to watch him take the major changes that are occurring and turn them to his and Selfridge's advantage.",1393286400,,846,4.760273972602739

5551198,2,B00B18FA50,While I usually like shows from this era and I generally like Jeremy Piven I thought his acting was little overdone. I found him annoying in some regards and the storyline looked to become too soap operaish.,1393286400,,207,4.621621621621622
5551199,5,B00B18FA50,This show had me hooked within the first five minutes.  I watched the entire season in one weekend and I can't wait for the next.  It is historical fiction with great characters that you instantly care about.,1393286400,,208,4.594594594594595

5551214,5,B00B18FA50,Very good true story about a interesting man who I had never heard of. Like so many great people he had revolutionary ideas but also a dark side.

5551222,5,B00B18FA50,The story starts out with a sense of adventure that really is fresh and unexpected. Characters begin to develop into their own story lines - very similar to Downton Abbey.

Overall great story line and can't wait to see another season!,1393113600,,342,4.622950819672131
5551223,5,B00B18FA50,It is so rare to see a show with a character with self confidence and able to think for themselves.

5551228,1,B00B18FA50,"Honestly,  I couldn't get past the actor playing Mr. Selfridge. His acting is incredibly bad. His rendition of an American is rather shallow,  a cartoon characature of an American businessman. The  scenes are beautiful but the main actor's large, white teeth are his greatest appeal.",1393113600,5,283,5.2444444444444445

5551233,5,B00B18FA50,The story line is very unique and gives a good history lesson for early 1900's English customs.  The actor that plays Mr. Selfridge is a bit pushed but the rest of the cast is perfect.,1393113600,,184,4.257142857142857

5551235,5,B00B18FA50,"My only cons: I really like Jeremy Piven's work, but this character demands a bit more gravitas & range than he's delivering (I could see a lot of other seasoned actors really nailing what I, as a viewer, expect to see).  Not sure if it's his failing or the directors'.  However, on the whole, the ensemble is very excellent.  I have a few problems with the production values.  i.e. 2,000 employees, but you never see more than twenty or so at every big meeting/announcement, and you only see a few small areas of this supposedly vast store.  A bit more creative thinking could really get a lot more bang for the buck (or pound?).",1393027200,,630,4.491228070175438

Mr. Selfridge has been worth our time and has a story that draws you in and makes you want to discover who Selfridge is, and why he is working so hard to build his business.  The peripheral story lines are strong also.  I believe I will be able to change this rating to 4 or 5 stars soon.",1393027200,,466,4.0989010989010985

The other actors are very good, and the story line is beginning to develop.  We're about halfway through season one.  I find that the transition from one episode to another isn't smooth.  You get a hint of whats happened in between episodes but never really see or hear the action, so you have to make assumptions.

5551268,4,B00B18FA50,"I decided to give this a shot. After all, I like shopping and Jeremy Piven should be good right? Right, it is good. At first, I didn't like Piven's performance. I thought it was too over the top and seemed more like a characteur rather than a real person. The fact that Mr. Harry Selfridge is based from a real person, he should seem real.  I thought Piven was a simple miscast, like he didn't really understand the character he was playing.  I've seen a lot of season 2 and his performance calms down a lot.  It starts to seem more real.
The other characters are much more real and flow so much better. If you like Downton Abbey you will like this.  It's quite charming and you do grow to care about these characters.",1392854400,,718,4.296296296296297

I can't seem to continue on to Season 2 with my Roku, though.  It was listed on my search, but when I click to select, it comes up as Season 1.  Frustrating.  Any suggestions?",1392854400,,279,4.188679245283019

5551282,2,B00B18FA50,"Piven's acting was flatter than a pancake.  It was torture to watch.  The costumes and sets were lovely and the story line interesting, but just couldn't get past the acting.",1392854400,3,174,4.766666666666667

5551285,5,B00B18FA50,I started watching Mr. Selfridge because I liked Downton Abbey so much (and wanted to watch more period pieces). This show has not disappointed. The show is set in a department store in London in the early 1900's when women's fashions as well as their rights were evolving. it's a great show with very good acting.,1392768000,,314,4.625
5551286,1,B00B18FA50,"The writing is really awful. The show is pretty to look at, and you can tell they spent a huge amount of money on the show, why not hire better writers? Nobody's characters are believable. Its like everyone  is a cartoon character. I feel like I'm watching a cartoon, and I can't tell if its supposed to be a comedy or what? One example: Lady May is sitting in the restaurant and more or less calls her chicken that she ordered boring. The waiter offers to fix it and returns with a new dish. She takes one tiny bite. She likes it. Gets up and leaves. What? She didn't even eat? That makes no sense. Every scene is pretty much just as ridiculous.",1392768000,4,646,4.252032520325203
5551287,5,B00B18FA50,"Great period costumes and sets.  Piven is a natural for the role.  Entertaining period piece.  Some people knock the thin story lines or call it too slick, but this is solid fun and  elegantly done.",1392768000,,198,4.571428571428571
5551288,4,B00B18FA50,This first episode was a little overwhelming with all the new introductions of characters.  It held my attention and I am interested in watching more episodes.,1392768000,,159,5.115384615384615
5551289,5,B00B18FA50,"This series is really great!  It takes place around the same time as Downton but from a different 'part of town' so to speak.
Actors fit their characters well and the story moves on;  the pace never slows down too much. The only bad point about this program is that we have to wait sooooooooooo long for the next season!!",1392768000,,321,4.333333333333333

5551292,5,B00B18FA50,"Love the time period: the costumes, the settings, the cars, etc.  The quality does not disappoint.  The storyline is good, too.  Love to watch the evolution of my favorite vice, shopping :)",1392768000,,189,4.84375

5551295,3,B00B18FA50,I would have given it a 5 star rating if there had been no  bedroom scenes. You can commuicate s situation without being graphic.,1392768000,,129,4.375
5551296,4,B00B18FA50,"This is a series that tends to reel you in bit by bit.  Piven was a little too unbelievable at first I think due to the writing, but he has grown nicely into his character.  The development of the characters has been solid and mirrors a lot of what we experience in modern day - it subtly reminds us that even over a century ago, we are still pretty much the same creatures in a new world.  Love that!  The costumes are a beautiful reminder of the elegance of the times even though as women, not a soul I know envies those ladies.",1392768000,,530,4.116504854368932

5551299,5,B00B18FA50,"Everything TV should be and seldom is. The Brits seem to understand how ensemble casts should work at every level.
My theory is there are 8 A list British actors and 16 B listers at any one time and they are often all on the same stage together. Brilliant!",1392768000,,256,4.244897959183674
5551300,5,B00B18FA50,Get involved with the characters. They are as contemporary today as they were in the early 1900's. Can't wait for Season 2.,1392768000,,123,4.636363636363637

5551306,4,B00B18FA50,"This was a fun series.  Hope it is renewed and continues the story.  Just wish the color quality was better.  I know it depicts the time, but the costumes are so pretty, it is a shame we don't see it in greater detail and sharper color.",1392681600,,236,4.086956521739131
5551307,5,B00B18FA50,Exciting series- Great characters and interesting story lines.  It's great for other famous stores to be mentioned Like Woolworth's and those special and famous guests to the store make it really enjoyable. You really get involved with the different classes and the social problems of the people involved.  Can't wait for season 2.,1392681600,,331,5.226415094339623

5551311,5,B00B18FA50,"I love the characters, the settings, and the story. The actors are superb! I like the romance,
the romantic conflicts, the character development through a character's dreams. Each episode
was masterfully woven and I was riveted! It was a period piece, yet the issues are timeless.",1392681600,,280,5.108695652173913

5551313,4,B00B18FA50,"A little story bookish but enjoyable anyway. For example, the demise of Miss Bunting shows Selfridge that he shpuld become more compassionate.  Very interesting to observe the different classes of that era.",1392681600,,206,5.4375
5551314,5,B00B18FA50,"Very intriguing and fun show. Realistic, troubling and exciting to watch. A great many players spread over an equally large plot line.

5551317,5,B00B18FA50,Loved watching the characters unfold. Great acting and plot. Seeking fortune and fame isn't always your ticket to happiness as we  know. Can't wait for season 2. A great series.,1392681600,,177,4.9
5551318,5,B00B18FA50,"Excellent period piece with likeable characters and masterful performances. Each performer owns their character. It deals in the realm of the social issues of the period, and is a refreshing escape from the modern day social agendas that are routinely shoveled at us in other contemporary programming (ie. global warming & gay marriage). Mr. Selfrige allows you to partake in an age long gone. Being the same time period and social manner of Titanic, I do have trouble shaking the notion of the store hitting an iceberg and sinking at any moment, but luckily that can't happen! Never thought I'd find myself binging episodes of PBS  Masterpiece Classic!!",1392681600,,654,5.055555555555555

5551321,5,B00B18FA50,"It is an interesting story and the characters are well played.  I am looking forward to the return of the series to see what old Harry does about his wife.  The acting is very realistic and never seems contrived and I especially like the history aspects of how the women's movement began and the attitudes of most men at the time.  Good history that we women sometimes forget how hard it was fought to get us the status we have to today.  (well, mostly anyway)",1392595200,,460,4.376470588235295

But by the end of the first episode I found myslef caring about what happened to many of the characters.  I like to clash between the American characters and the staid British emphasis on class. I wonder if this series was created to appeal to an American audience.
My rating is based on the first two episodes.",1392595200,,392,4.3561643835616435

It's enough at this point to say that I plan to continue watching it, and it's possible that my rating may go up. The actor who plays the titular character displays some nuance as he portrays a man who shifts back and forth from a more genuine personality in unguarded moments, to the public persona that he wishes to project to others.",1392595200,,420,4.329113924050633

5551341,5,B00B18FA50,I am new to Kindle and Amazon Prime.  Mr. Selfridge is an amazing discovery.  I hope it never ends.  It has all the drama and innuendoes  that raises eyebrows and curiosity every episode.  The characters are dignified and interesting.  It is about the starting of the department store shopping in London and how it has evolved and overcome growing pains.  I will look for more shows like this.  I am not certain if there is a Season 2.  I am addicted!,1392508800,,451,4.469135802469136

5551347,4,B00B18FA50,Good acting and very well cast.  The Selfridge building survived the bombing of London and remains open and fashionable even today.  It was voted best department store in London 2010.,1392508800,,183,5.066666666666666

5551351,5,B00B18FA50,I enjoy watching shows in this time period.  Storyline was ininteresting to see how American ideas were brought into the European ways to doing things.,1392508800,,151,5.04
5551352,5,B00B18FA50,I started watching this just to pass some time.  After the first episode i had to watch the rest of the season in a mini marathon.  The  acting is excellent.  I especially like that this is based on the real person.,1392508800,,215,4.170731707317073

5551354,4,B00B18FA50,"I found this, while not one of my favourite series, to be totally engaging, and am happy to have come across it. I would recommend it to most people as an interestingly relayed account of another's success in life and eventual betrayal, not only by himself, but by those close to him.

By the second show we were hooked and watched every single episode in about a week. Now, it too, is on hiatus.
Does anyone work any more?",1392422400,,335,4.075757575757576

5551359,5,B00B18FA50,"At first I thought it was a joke...or that this particular actor had an English Doppleganger.  But Jeremy Piven, who I have only previously seen in B rated comedies and children's movies like Spy Kid's 4, seems to have quite a range built into his acting skills.  This series may be my new addiction.  I am very interested to see if the descriptive seeds that seem to have been planted for each character in the pilot will grow in a predictable direction or if the Masterpiece trademark will cultivate an alternative mysterious grafting for the love tesseract that they have presented.  So far I am more intrigued by the relationship between characters than any one character, but there is promise, since one cannot yet tell if the main character, Mr. Selfridge, is selfless and endowing or just completely self absorbed and oblivious with power.  I am hopeful to watch future episodes unfold the complex plan to which the pilot has insinuated.",1392422400,,944,4.838509316770186
5551360,3,B00B18FA50,This series had potential.  I'm so tired of the portrayal of infidelity in movies.  Aren't there any stories where the characters have character in spite of the trials and temptations?  Now that is a story.,1392422400,,206,4.828571428571428

5551364,5,B00B18FA50,"I did a marathon watch of the first season this past few days.  Can't for season 2 & 3.  I had seen some of season 2 and this first season sure helps to understand the parts I'd already seen.  Love the fact that it's at least partially biographical and really makes me want to plan a visit to London, just to see how things have changed or stayed the same.",1392422400,,356,4.057142857142857

5551366,2,B00B18FA50,There is a good and different base to the story but Selfridge is so egotistical it kind of turned me off.  Then the story turned kind of trashy with everyone having affairs and pretending they are so above everyone else so I quit watching it in the middle of the first episode.,1392422400,2,277,4.326923076923077
5551367,5,B00B18FA50,Loved it and hated it ending. I hope there is a season 2. Jeremy Previn is a delight to watch.,1392422400,,94,3.75

I have trounble sleeping and many a night I have been entertained by Mr. Selfridge, his family.and the other eployees at the store.

Jeremy Pivens is his usual high energy self, but the other characters are really the most watchable aspect. Love the clothes, the history, everything. Give this one a try!",1392422400,,366,4.318840579710145
5551374,5,B00B18FA50,If you love shows like Downton Abbey or Upstairs Downstairs then you will love this!

5551378,5,B00B18FA50,Great characters and character development.  Story line twists and turns pulling the viewer  into the world of Selfridges.  Like the way historical characters are interspersed with fictitious one keeping the plot grounded in history.  Excellent show!  Looking forward to 2014 season.,1392336000,,283,5.804878048780488
5551379,5,B00B18FA50,Like Downton Abbey but for the shopaholic. Superb acting and intriguing story that follows actual historical events. PBS and masterpiece theater do it again,1392336000,,156,5.541666666666667
5551380,5,B00B18FA50,Interesting time period and incredible costumes and scenes!  The characters are lovable and full of life!

Viwers will soon have their own favorite characters to look for in each episode.

5551392,3,B00B18FA50,"The drama is fairly lightweight, but I have enjoyed watching Season 1 on Prime.  Jeremy Piven's Mr. Selfridge is full of stage-y gestures, expressions, and dramatic speech.  He'd give PT Barnum a run for his money!  Though he spends much of the series cheesing and gesturing, by the end, you see his optimism and confidence aren't so bullet proof after all.  The sets and costumes are opulent and gorgeous.  I will keep watching for that alone.",1392249600,,444,4.7894736842105265

5551395,5,B00B18FA50,A great story line that is well scripted and Downton-esque.  A few holes in the story line and a bit of overacting at times but a low key and entertaining way to enjoy a piece of history.,1392249600,,187,4.054054054054054

Mr. Selfridge is bigger then life and delivers bigger then life to his customers. He cares for his employee's, but if the need rises he takes strong steps.  Try the first show if your not hooked, try the second and I think you will be.

5551403,5,B00B18FA50,"While Downton Abbey does a fine job of showing the beginning of the 20th century in rural England, it only touches on city life.  For that we have Mr. Selfridge.

It takes a fictional view of the real life Harry Stanton Selfridge, who was instrumental in building Marshall Fields (in Chicago) into the first modern department store,and later moved to London, with visions of creating the first modern British equivalent.

Jeremy Piven is wonderful as Mr. Selfridge, a master showman and salesman, who tries to balance his business life, family life, and personal life in the context of changing society (many of the change being ones he was influencing), and the rest of the cast (British) does a wonderful job as well.",1392249600,,719,4.877049180327869

5551407,4,B00B18FA50,"The setting is fascinating: the rise of modern retail. London at the turn of the century gives us sustained focus into the shifting boundaries and tensions of the time between male and female, rich and poor, and glimpses into human condition issues like art, love, fashion, consumerism. Like Downton Abbey and others of similar composition, Selfridge can teeter between soap opera and historical fiction, and I'm more interested when it doesn't lose the latter.

Mr. Selfridge himself is an overly optimistic and gregarious business genius, and while the character is intended to be larger than life, I almost didn't make it through the firsts few episodes because of what feels like over-acting: his grins are too broad, his sullen faces too dewy-eyed (almost comically)--like a young boy making a ""sad face."" But if I can suspend this complaint ( and it gets a touch easier as they fill out his character), the show is worth it.",1392163200,,930,4.961538461538462
5551408,5,B00B18FA50,I enjoyed watching the series. I had no idea there was one when I ordered the book. Glad I read the book first - it is easier to pick away the fact from fiction in the series.

He brought women's cosmetics to the front of the store, supported suffragettes, and other radical things.  The supporting cast is wonderful and they all have their own little dramas to go through.

The daughter Lois is too pale, not nearly vibrant enough. Lady Mae is not convincing. Grove, Crabb, Agnes, Mardle are all very good. Kitty is adorable and seems destined for a more important piece of the action.

I'd not been a huge fan of Jeremy Piven's before, but I absolutely love him in this role- as the bigger-than-life gregarious, generous, huge dreaming, faulty, haunted, complicated man.

It is very well written keeping your attention the entire time.  The costuming and characters put you directly in the period. The idea of a brash american opening a store in class ridden England is original and filled with opportunities to have many subplots in every episode.
It is racy without nudity which is rare and still keeps your interest.

Very much like how he does business, and the struggle between morality is interesting.  Don't understand how he does this and then has a series of affairs....  Will go back for Season 2 to see how some of the relationships develop.  Like the relationship between the window dresser and his apprentice",1391299200,,477,4.686746987951807

The newest inventions and historical figures of the times appear in the various episodes. The cast of characters in not too unwieldy though. You will no doubt pick out a favorite or two over time. Jeremy Piven does an excellent job portraying the self-centered but often considerate and surprising Mr. Selfridge - his surname describes him well. The other cast do an outstanding job. I prefer Grgory Fitoussi (as Henri Leclair) and  Aisling Loftus (as Agnes Towler). As I mentioned you'll find your favorites.,1391299200,,633,4.971698113207547

5551597,4,B00B18FA50,"i was excited to see this show as i love british period pieces. at first i thought the usual low-brow comedic actor jeremy pivens was a bit out of his element, but as i finished the season i came to enjoy his performance more and more as the complicated mr. selfridge. the supporting cast is stellar and once i got a few episodes in, especially, i was hooked. i am so excited to season 2 to see how their storylines turn out.  all the characters show great depth (and growth) as the series goes on. of course the costumes are exquisite and the sets are marvelous.  being transported to that kind of store, at that time, is just enchanting. i just love this time, and the store is framed in a way that incorporates what was going on historically/culturally, for example the suffrage movement, sir arthur conan doyle, maria pavlova, etc. it is so interesting how the show highlights changes that were going on at that time, things that we take for granted today such as perfume being sold on a counter top in proud display. i think that overall it is very well done, although i could not quite give it 5 stars, i can't exactly put my finger on why. i suppose it is that to me, some of the storylines are a little hard to swallow and sometimes the character's actions are hard to believe (the painter and mr. grove come to mind), but i won't give any spoilers. it was nothing outrageous, and it is still a great series that i will continue to watch. definitely recommend!!",1391212800,,1469,4.416974169741698

5551600,2,B00B18FA50,I like Jeremy Piven and have been a fan since he played a burn out on Garry Shandling but he's a comedic actor and was unfairly cast In a role out of his range. Why not Louis CK as Hamlet?,1391212800,2,188,3.725

5551610,4,B00B18FA50,Nice to see a a different story about the past that interests people of today about merchandising. The story shows what an ambitious man will do to attract customers into his store and in country that is very formal.

5551616,5,B00B18FA50,"I had a Mr. Selfridge binge this week. I discovered it on Monday and finished Season One in 3 days. It is a fascinating story based on Harry Gordon Selfridge, the American who went to England and founded the first real department store where customers were encouraged to browse. He was gutsy and forward thinking and responsible for the way stores are set up today. If you have ever worked in retail, you will find it fascinating. Read up on him on the internet. It is worth a peek.",1391126400,,482,4.426966292134831

5551618,5,B00B18FA50,"I have downloaded every episode from every season  using Amazon.com.  In less than 3 minutes, I am in my zone watching the antics of Mr. Selfridge and his wife, ""A Rose by any other name!"".

I so enjoy the conflict of ""do as I say and not as I do!""  Jeremy Piven delivers his lines ~ good, bad or indifferent, with such conviction that you are riveted to him as closely as his staff & confidentes.  The drama of Harry Selfridge and the opening of his London department store set in 1909 is brilliantly written and acted.  I am very curious to find out how long Harry can keep up this game of having affairs in his personal life and how they impact his professional life.  Let viewers beware when life seems too good to be true!

I LOVE this Masterpiece Classic Series for myriad reasons, mostly for the fashion trends and, of course, the drama.  May Selfridge & Co. always be on trend and Mr. Selfridge's persistence to pursue perfection in every aspect of his life, continue for many years to come.

Cheers",1391040000,,1007,4.423913043478261

I do have to say, it isn't as classy as Downton, and the first few episodes led me to believe the show would be kind of predictable.  However, I was wrong.  The first season is good, and its worth watching.  I've fallen in love with a few of the characters, esp. Ms. Towler.",1390867200,,424,4.3164556962025316

5551665,4,B00B18FA50,"I did enjoy this series very much. It was not like Downton Abbey or pride and prejudice but i put it up there with many of my other favorites.
For women, clothes cannot be beat! Romantic and makes you wonder how long did it take them to dress....also explains why they did need people to dress them if they were upper class.
 It did well to show all classes of people in England during that time and since Downton Abbey is now popular was fun to tie it in with clothes, how houses were decorated etc....
 Personally, Pivens did a job as white male well off feeling entitlement  of stepping out on his wife, but how dare her if it is even a possibility.  I liked how his wife was much stronger than it seemed from the start.
 My husband watched it with me and he also enjoyed it. So it had enough of male perspective to keep him interested.",1390867200,,839,4.21875

5551670,4,B00B18FA50,"I have watched and purchased many of the British movies, comedies and dramas and so far they are far superior to any thing that is on our American Television. While we bow down to junk TV the Brits favor really interesting characters who display bravery, courage, flaws, and real humor. They seem to understand how to use the English language so much better than the Americans do t make shows funny or dramatic with out being so crude and tasteless. So I will continue to buy and watch their Mr. Selfridge, Call The Midwife, Are You Being Served, The Last of the Summer Wine, As Time Goes By, Cranford  etc.etc. You just can't beat their quality. I just wish we could produce their quality, Hallmark TV shows come about as close as America can get to the British shows.",1390867200,,769,4.532374100719425

5551685,4,B00B18FA50,Very interesting perspective of the world of retail and life in London during that era. I love the characters. I want to see how the painter character will play out in season 2. Mr Selfridge himself is a great character and Jeremy Piven is perfect for this role. A must watch.,1390867200,,276,4.431372549019608
5551686,5,B00B18FA50,"I always wanted to travel back in time to see what life was like in cities back when retailers ""did it all and did it extravagantly"" and this series definitely fills the bill.  If you liked Titanic for the period costumes, the sets, etc., you will definitely like Mr. Selfridge.  A bit faster moving than Downton Abbey, the added twist of an American family in placed in London in the 1900's is great and kept me wanting more episodes.  Can't wait for season 2!",1390867200,,461,4.464285714285714

5551699,4,B00B18FA50,"Mr. Selfridge is another great Masterpiece.  I can't figure out if Jeremy Piven is trying to be a little stiff with his acting (maybe that's Selfridge's personality?), or if he is just having a challenge with a role that's so different from Ari Gold.  Either way, it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of this show.  Maybe it helps that I think Piven is good-looking.

If you like Downton Abbey, The Paradise, and Call the Midwife, you'll enjoy Mr. Selfridge.",1390608000,,458,4.7594936708860756

5551704,5,B00B18FA50,"Found this one, hoping it would be like Downton Abbey.  However, I noticed lots of parallels between this series and Madmen instead.  Selfridge is Don Draper and Ann Towler is Peggy Olson.",1390435200,,188,4.84375
5551705,3,B00B18FA50,"I'm a big fan of ""The Paradise"" and ""Downton Abbey"" and almost anything with a period theme, But, having just watched the first episode of Mr. Selfridge, I'm not compelled to see what is going to happen. The lead character, Mr Selfridge, is played in such a stilted manner that it is almost uncomfortable to watch. I guess, since it is made by the Brits, it is somehow their idea of what a brash American would act like, a type of character I can envision, but not like this guy.  I may watch more of the episodes someday out of a little curiosity, but, not if I have anything else to do.",1390435200,,588,4.25
5551706,2,B00B18FA50,"The whole things turns too much on the surface and never stops to draw a serious breath. Many opportunities are presented for Mr. Selfridge to unveil a deeper side to himself, such as when Mr. Waring backs out of the deal to build and open the department store, but Mr. Selfridge hardly misses a beat and goes on dancing maniacally, so to speak. I don't say there is a call for gravitas here, but I would have preferred casting have gotten someone with greater nuance of expression than glaring audacity. I got tired of the smirk and smugness of the main character. I won't watch more episodes unless there really is nothing else. Next!",1390435200,8,636,4.587719298245614

Love the story and love that an American made Selfridges such a success across the big pond. Mr. Piven is a wonderful actor so believable as this larger than life man. All the casting has been done in my opinion expertly! ( nice to see Amanda Abbington is also in Sherlock as Mary, wife of Dr. Watson. )Gotta love the UK!!!
This series is a joy to watch! Love seeing history come to life...of course some poetic licence I am sure was used. The only sad part is that the story continues in the UK and we have to wait!",1390435200,,645,4.168
5551709,3,B00B18FA50,An English series. Average rating but with a good story line. Worthwhile watching.  I do like the English setting..and it was very easy to follow with the american actors.,1390435200,,171,4.896551724137931
5551710,3,B00B18FA50,When I first watched this I could not believe how awful Jeremy Piven's acting was in this role! So flat! I decided to give it another chance.. And have to say it grew on me. The rest of the cast makes up for Piven's blah acting. Other than the total mis-cast of the main character.. it was pretty good. Kept me intrigued thru the whole season.,1390435200,,343,4.212121212121212

5551720,3,B00B18FA50,"I like this show, but Jeremy Piven's character is a little one note. He is usually intense, but the best performances he gives are when he is tender and regretful. After all the years of Entourage I know the over the top side of his range, it is refreshing when he tones it down. I really love history and London so this held my attention. It isn't so good that I can't wait to see the next episode. This isn't a binge show so far, more like a tasty leftover I snack on now and then.",1390435200,,483,4.041666666666667

8560514,3,B00B18FA50,"The Paradise was such a better series on a similar setting. The lead actor in this is just grating and affected in my opinion. I have a grudge against this series because the BBC or PBS opted to give it another season rather than give The Paradise a Season 3. Unfortunately I don't see The Paradise (another BBC series) here on Amazon Prime, though I think it used to be. You can find both seasons on Netflix.

You find yourself rooting for Harry at times, angry with him at times, feeling sorry for him at times, and in tears for him at times. I didn't want the shows to end but there wasn't anyplace to go after the end of Season 4. I don't know if I'm glad they changed the ending of Selfridge's life for the series but it was better I suppose than having to show what really happened to the man and all that was left of him in the end. Jeremy Piven did a fantastic job playing this bold, brash, quirky, weak, lonely man who didn't think much of himself whenever he failed but couldn't seem to stop failing even in his successes. All the cast in all four series did a magnificent job. A big kudos to them all. This is one that you save on your shelf to watch again in about a year. Fast paced, you can almost binge through it in about three days. Thanks for making this available.",1527033600,,1042,4.189054726368159
