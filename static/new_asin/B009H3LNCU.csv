8541482,5,B009H3LNCU,"As a fan of the original Stanglers, I approached this with some concern.  But three of the original members are still there and, while no one can replace Hugh Cornwell, I found Paul Roberts to be a compelling front man with a lot of charisma and a strong, deep voice.  Burrell and Greenfield are at the top of their game and good old Jet Black propels it on. Baz Warne (now the band's front man) is very good on guitar. More than acceptable production values.  Also, I found most of the newer songs that I didn't know are quite enjoyable.",1526947200,,538,4.36

8541486,5,B009H3LNCU,"Paul Roberts shreds...................Jet Black is alive and very well..........Boz is incredible, and I think Hugh Cornwell should be very proud................JJ and Dave are as great as ever, not only as the backbone but great up front as well. A fantastic in the face performance by all of them!",1392336000,5,299,5.25
