460507,5,6302404223,"Crazy from the Heart has always been one of my favorite movies. It's a feel good movie about an educator not settling for her boring, humdrum life and her self-centered, jock boyfriend. It doesn't matter what race/nationality you are in matters of the heart. It's about investing time and consideration in another person you value. I had it on VHS and when we switched to DVDs and tossed the tapes, I had to purchase a DVD copy.",1487376000,,428,4.571428571428571

460571,5,6302404223,"OK, this is an oldie, and hasn't aged real well.  It's hardly shocking in this day and age for people from different cultures to date and fall in love.  But I love the two leading characters.  I saw this movie years ago; well, it was more than a few decades ago.  Now you know I'm old.  But I've never forgotten this movie and was happy I finally had a chance to watch it again.  I'm not sure I'd tell anyone I know about it, and I watched it while my husband was gone.  It's a guilty pleasure, like buying that chocolate shake at McDonald's twice a year that I really shouldn't, but I sure enjoy it down to the last slurp.  And I don't tell my husband about that either.",1474156800,,671,4.107692307692307

460610,1,6302404223,I have seen the movie several times when it was first filmed. It was on TV quite a few times in 1991 but could never find it in the stores. I rented it several times but then the rental places did not have it and they all went out of business. It is definitely a 5 star movie and portrays small town America. I grew up in a small town in LA and it reminded me of those days. I was so glad to finally find it. I have been pleased with all of my purchases on Amazon.,1467244800,,464,3.7448979591836733
460611,3,6302404223,"The movie required some editing in the second half. They should have spent more time with R. Blades and shown  his ranch more, instead of so much time on the old boyfriend. It made the second half of a good movie drag some. The acting was very good. C. Lahti portrayed a teacher that gave her boyfriend forever to decide if he ever wanted to marry her. It just seemed like the old boyfriend was on the screen a little too much!  You'll have to watch the movie to decide.",1467072000,2,470,4.211111111111111

460615,5,6302404223,"This was a date night rental for my husband and me when we were dating... I am anglo, he is hispanic, and we're both from Texas. He had seen it before and I had not, and he thought I'd get a kick out of it... which, I did! We've had many laughs over the almost 21 years of our marriage, remembering how we laughed at some of the comical situations when you're a mixed race couple. I sure wish this movie was available on DVD or e-download. I own the VHS, but the players are pretty much a thing of the past now, and I'm afraid to damage the tape as old as it is now. Great movie.",1463184000,,579,3.9152542372881354

460681,5,6302404223,"I remembered seeing this movie on Showtime years and years ago and loved it. I was hoping it would come out on DVD and here it is. Christine Lahti is charming as the uptight high school principal who lives a very quiet and orderly life. Her boyfriend is the high school gym teacher who thinks a great date night is watching a sporting event from his recliner while eating his dinner (hey, that sounds familiar...right girls???)
When the school janitor Ernesto (Ruben Blades) gets Charlotte to go out on a date with him, suddenly her view of life opens up in very surprising way. A sweet and romantic film that will stay with you long after you've watched it. Highly Recommended!",1452038400,,678,4.6115702479338845

460739,5,6302404223,"This movie was charming and funny. It was actually my introduction to Reuben Blades as an actor, and he was a delight. You were just drawn to him, and you had to root for this couple to get together, as different as their backgrounds were. I had a copy on VHS, and have had Crazy from the Heart on my wish list for DVD for some time. I was so happy to finally find it available on Amazon. Don't miss Blade's on-screen daddy, he is just ornery adorable also, a sort of senior rebel.",1445299200,4,481,4.127659574468085

In any case it is a beautiful love story. It makes you think and it makes you smile at the same time. You will end up simply adoring Rubn Blades. One irony of note: the lady who played the mom on the George Lopez show has a small part in this movie; she plays a nondescript race woman who is prejudiced against Mexicans. Great acting on her part.
Give this movie a chance. I am sure you won't regret it.",1431475200,,558,3.9469026548672566

Christine Lahti is one of my favorite actresses, and she does not disappoint in this movie.  Her transition from straight-laced high school principal to tequila with beer chaser drinker, dancing, run off to Mexico and get married woman is just classic!!  She and Reuben Blades have the chemistry to pull this movie off.  Chick Flick.....yes it is, but don't let that scare you away.

People are just people- with the same needs, desires, hopes and dreams that you have, and other people's prejudices, and narrow-mindedness, are totally beside the point, when your heart pulls you in the opposite direction.  Can a high school principal really find happiness with the Tex-Mex janitor, in a provincial Texas town?  Why not, if you are ""crazy from the heart.""  Maybe it's not reality, but it should be.

The premise is that opposites can and do attract and sometimes we don't know what's good for us until we have a chance to walk on the other side of the street.  This movie is about bigotry, love, betrayal and laughter, but most of all the message comes through that our station in life is not indicative of where our heart lies.

I get the lawn cut in less than half the time than with an ""old-timey"" rotary mower.  I don't like messing around with gasoline so, this mower is perfect for me, a senior citizen.  Remembering to watch out for the electric cord is not a problem if one treats the activity as though one is vacuuming a floor.  Hope this is a helpful review.",1405123200,,448,4.223529411764706

This is a story of a high school principal and a janitor.  Who would ever think the two would fall in love, but they do.  It causes an uproar in the community, but the principal stands her ground.

461171,5,6302404223,"It's a ""feel good"" movie, but not schmaltzy.  It portrays how small towns can be so judgmental and make people afraid to do anything that might get them talked about.  It shows how one woman finally realized she doesn't have to answer to anybody for her actions.  I can identify with that.",1397347200,,289,4.519230769230769
461172,5,6302404223,"Both of the male leads in the movie reminded me of my boyfriend of 10 years. He was Hispanic, very romantic, and I loved dancing with him. He still wouldn't get off his duff and marry me. We had broken up for over five years when I showed it to him and his mother. He, of course, identified himself with the Hispanic lead, without seeing how he lost the love he could have had with me. Afterwards, he said something like ""See, this is what real love is like."" I felt like shouting back at him... ""SEE! This is what REAL LOVE is like!""

I enjoyed every bit of it. The pyro father, Brent Spiner as the school administrator, the attraction of a nice pair of legs from the viewpoint of the toilet, the mother's consolation of ""Who's ahead in the game?"", and the young lovers, both of whose parents thought their child was too good for a teen pregnancy.

As to the DVD - Well, first of all I really never expected that it would make it to DVD but I am so very glad it did!  I paid way too much to get the VHS tape of this movie, before my internet days (like WAY too much!).  But I just had to have it and, for whatever reason, this particular movie was massively expensive on VHS.  The DVD, is the quality I would expect for a television movie that is well over twenty years old, so it's not crisp and beautiful like today's videos.  But it's good enough to watch without the lack of today's technology quality getting in the way. It's the love of the movie that makes me ok watching it again in not super great video quality.  I played it on my Sony Blu-ray player, so it probably looked a little nicer than it might otherwise have.",1394928000,5,1049,4.1840796019900495

I'm not much for the romance genre but this was okay.  The humor was a bit too dry for me, but my parents got big laughs out of all the jokes & there were some very funny moments for me too.

Christine Lahti,  Ruben Blades and William Russ give stellar performances as Charlotte, the high school principal, Earnesto, the school janitor and William Russ as coach Wittcome. Charlotte seems a little confused as to just whom is disrespecting her when her students teepee her house with toilet paper but after meeting and talking with Earnesto gets the whole thing straight in her mind.  It takes her awhile but she realized that she was doing what was expected of her in dating the coach even though it was making her very unhappy.  Even Earnesto's father has a minor speech on the subject of respect in the court room and to his daughter.  Very thought provoking.  Thank you for getting this movie for me.  I absolutely love it.

Now getting back to the movie what can I say that others haven't?  When I'm depressed I watch this movie because it makes me cry, smile, and leaves me with a feeling of happiness.  My favorite part is when Christine Lahti goes on her first date with Reuben Blades and gets drunk. To me the scene is a classic.  From being a stuffy prude to learning how much life has to offer and how wonderful it can be no matter what others think is the moral here.

It stuck with me all that time...the grandfather especially and Ruben Blades' character.  So, after I gave up ever seeing it again, I bought the VHS tape here on Amazon for a whopping $35.00 (new) and its pretty much the only reason why I still has my VHS player.",1309392000,,417,4.0120481927710845

461298,5,6302404223,"Just like the types of people Mike Rowe honors in his ""Dirty Jobs"" show.

I saw this movie eons ago on Lifetime TV.  I found it in a tape rental store at one point in time and watched it, but forgot it existed until I caught the tail end of it on a VCR tape I was using to record my soap operas during the week.  Surfing the internet, I found that I could buy it and I did.

Christine Lahti stars as the high school principal who is engaged to the track coach at the same high school.  Rather than get married like she wants, the coach keeps putting her off, leading Charlotte (Lahti) to doubt her love for the coach. Enter in the janitor hired by the school district to fix Charlotte's leaky toilet.  After blowing him off at first, she finally relents and goes on a date with him only to travel to Mexico on their first date. I won't say more than that to keep from spoiling it.

Fantastic movie that is worth watching again and again.",1290470400,,937,4.143646408839779

The main character (Christine Lahti) finds the courage to follow her heart and fight the system so she can be happy for the first time in her life. The comedy is great. It has some language, no nudity. It is one of my all time favorite movies.",1252108800,,353,4.2835820895522385

Unfortunately, the only VHS tape I ended up with was taped on SLP, and missed the first few minutes of the movie.  I just transferred it to DVD last night, and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.

I'm not sure if this love story really could happen in real life, but I hope it can! Christine Lahti is believable and endearing (and gorgeous - I wish I had those clothes!). While being well known as a musician, Ruben Blades has proven that he's an excellent actor with very diverse roles.

I love the scene where they are at the beach and Ruben Blades is singing a romantic song to Christina Lahti.

Tommy Muniz, as Ruben Blades father, was extremely funny. His acting was very good and it puts the social undertone very low key.",1233964800,,420,4.048192771084337

I find that many of them have a common sensibility, namely a cross-cultural appeal. I don't even want to go there -- to that place that says such a gentle  and loving movie as this cannot find its audience because of the determination of the American film culture to retain the old, ""traditional"" Euro-American bias. It's just too depressing.

And where is William Russ these days? His ""Dew-ey"" is one of my favorite film characters of all time",1139702400,9,560,4.58

And one of the few titles that still is not out is ""Crazy from the Heart"". I bought the VHS when it was inexpensive. Now they're asking outrageous prices for the tape version since there is no DVD. About once a week I type the title of the movie hoping that it will be released real soon.  No such luck so far. It's one of my wife's and myself included favorite movies to watch.

It isn't available at a reasonable price so I could send it as a gift.  It isn't available to buy as a DVD for gifts.  This is such a waste of great story telling at its best and so few will see it.
