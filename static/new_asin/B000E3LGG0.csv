She has a great ""BODY,"" but she should learn that it's OK to have sex with a man, once in awhile!! To me, ""Playing with PENNY"" isn't worth ""TWO CENTS!!""",1242604800,,266,4.134615384615385
8304838,2,B000E3LGG0,"Much the same sort of thing you might see late at night on Skinemax.  Non-explicit, non-hardcore erotica.  Slender plot concerns Penny (Jenna West) who becomes interested in poker through her boyfriend Derek (Yanni Kratsas?).  Derek wants to play in a big tournament, but objects when Penny wants to throw her chips into the pot.  The movie revolves around Penny practicing and scheming to get into the game until she and Derek have some make-up fun at the end.

Female cast:

Jenna West: Modestly attractive red-head, natural body, few tattoos.  Featured in all erotic scenes: three MF scenes, one FF scene, one FFF scene.

Nicole Oring: Very attractive dark-skinned asian girl, many tattoos, enhanced (but well-done; props to the surgeon).  One FF scene, one FFF scene.

Sharon Wild: Pretty blonde girl (reminds me of Brigette Fonda), natural body, few tattoos.  One FFF scene.

Again, non-explicit and far from scorching-hot, but scenes are rather longer than is normal for this type of video.  Actors don't look like they are having a great time, but neither do they look bored to death.  Camera work is decent though it looks like the feature was filmed at somebody's house.  Repetitive music.  Good sound quality.  You get what you pay for.",1149984000,10,1246,5.0
