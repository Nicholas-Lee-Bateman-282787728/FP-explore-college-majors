1879637,4,B000096FVK,This was a movie of the week on one of the networks.  Who knew that the actresses wouldlater become more famous than Sally Kellerman?  The dialogue is so camp and dated now.  The scenes of winter time in Russia are perfect.  It is worth watching!,1185753600,7,246,4.4
1879638,3,B000096FVK,"This movie deals with a time period long past, and it is hard to take it seriously. The main character is played by Linda Hamilton, an actress who epitomizes the 1980ies and who I just happen to like. She plays an innocent Russian girl who is recruted into a kind of an academy and turned into a ""bait"" for Americans targeted for blackmail schemes by the Soviets. Nobody cared about authenticity as far as the Russian settings are concerned, but the moral conflicts the heroine runs into are handled with tact.",1171238400,10,510,4.615384615384615
1879639,5,B000096FVK,"For you Cold War movies buffs out there, this one is a jem. I saw this movie as a kid on TV, and since then remembered one of its key scences : ""What is Americans' religion ?"" ""Protestantism ?"" ""No, sex"". Linda Hamilton, Geena Davis and Sally Kellerman are just great. Here, You have all that so cheesy ""80s ambiance"" that's SOOO cool. The dance scene when Soviet spies of both sexes meet for the first time is great. You just have to watch this with friends and have a great laugh. See also ""The Experts"", another forgotten cold war jem from the 1980s, with John Travolta.",1148601600,13,573,4.364485981308412
