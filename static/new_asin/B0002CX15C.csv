8026387,4,B0002CX15C,"This movie will not only entertain children with its excellent graphics, ample death, lack of continuity, and animated elf girl cleavage.  It will also teach them valuable lessons, like 'it's absolutely normal to snuggle with your cousin,' 'stealing is okay if your friends do it,' and 'knock off toys are the best, because if your dad doesn't pay attention to you, and also crashes his plane whilst flying a top secret mission in the mountains just outside town in a snowstorm on Christmas eve, they'll come to life, rescue him, and make him love you.'  Its heartwarming songs like that one in the beginning I forgot, and its message of 'Christmas stars should be harvested for chocolate' will surely be remembered and shared for generations.",1514764800,,743,4.936
8026388,1,B0002CX15C,just a terrible random weird ramble that made no sense. awful.,1451347200,,62,4.7272727272727275
8026389,1,B0002CX15C,It was so bad that it couldn't keep my grandchildren's attention. Definitely not even close to miricle in toyland. I wasted my money.,1378166400,,133,4.826086956521739
8026390,5,B0002CX15C,"This movie is such a relief from all of today's modern grpahics and action and high-end actors/actressed and so on.  It is simply a very good and entertaining Christmas film.  It suits young boys somewhat better than girls, but I honestly would buy it for both.  The songs are so fun that we sing them all year long.  This is a keeper!",1294531200,2,335,4.354838709677419
