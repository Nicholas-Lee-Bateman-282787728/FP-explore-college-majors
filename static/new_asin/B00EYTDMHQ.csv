8610442,5,B00EYTDMHQ,"A few words about this overlooked nugget of a film that seems to have unwisely slipped everyone by.

Written and Directed by LEE KIRK in 2012 - its original title was ""The Giant Mechanical Man"" - which was quickly followed by its less difficult but more commercially feasible name - ""Love In Detroit"". To confuse matters even more - it appears to be only available to UK buyers as an import DVD and BLU RAY that goes under the name of ""Karlek I Detroit"" because its issued in DENMARK (or SWEDEN?).

Im sensing that the sellers of this lovely movie bottled out of the quirky original title and opted for the horrid and cheesy ""Love In Detroit"" instead - also elevating the prettier Malin Akerman to the top of the cover (the blond) when she really only has a back part in the story (the original poster only includes the two principal leads at a bar).

Janice is a young slightly kooky temp (Jenna Fisher of the American TV series The Office) who cant seem to hold down a job. One day on the train platform she spots a street mime artist that she somehow connects with. Tim is kind of hard not to miss - because he stands nearly ten feet tall and is painted head to toe in silver (Chris Messina of Aaron Sorkins The Newsroom  he plays Jane Fondas son in the show Reese Lansing). Tim doesnt engage with passers-by (except maybe a TV crew who spot an interesting morning segment). Feeling low  she engages in conversation with the still silver giant whom of course doesnt flinch a muscle in keeping with his street art. But Tim has noticed Janice

Tims pretty but ambitious girlfriend (Lucy Punch) has had enough of Tims art-for-the-people dreams - as has her brother (a fantastic turn by Bob Odenkirk  Lets Call Saul in Breaking Bad). He needs a job  so he gets one at a Zoo when he meets Janice. Without his make-up - they slowly and awkwardly edge towards each other (without her knowing of his alter ego). Thrown into the mix to tempt weak-kneed Janice is Topher Grace as a longhaired self-help book-selling twat. Will Janice be able to fend off her pushy sisters interventions (Malin Akerman) in her hopeless love life? Will she stop dreaming of her teeth falling out? Will the two society misfits make it in a sometimes cold and meddlesome world?

A fabulous and genuinely touching film (which I own on Euro BLU RAY) - The Giant Mechanical Man also uses locations in the presently much-maligned and bankrupt city of Detroit to amazing effect.

Both the DVD (Region 2) and the BLU RAY (Region B) play on UK and European machines without compatibility issues. I bought the BLU RAY and the 1:85 (16 x 9) Full Aspect Anamorphic picture quality is gorgeous  a beautifully filmed piece of work (no bars top or bottom). Subtitles are English, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish.

Give this gem a chance  I liked it so much  I had to buy it. I find hopeful and lovely things are like that",1394668800,2,2887,4.526923076923077
