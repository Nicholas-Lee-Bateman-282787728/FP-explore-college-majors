8440776,4,B004TP55WA,"Being the big Pokemon fan that I have been for over 12 years, I've seen these 2 movies to death over the years. Heck, I watch all of the Pokemon movies in November to celebrate my birthday every year. So as I was drawing closer to Blu Ray, it was great news there were releasing the films onto Blu Ray.

Was it worth the wait and upgrade? Let's take a look.

I won't go into story details since most of us have probably seen the movies, but if you haven't this will make your mind up over which format to go for anyway.

As Heroes goes, I was never really a bit fan of the English Dub. It just really falls short of the much superior Japanese version not just in voices, but in picture too. For some reason or another, they added a blue taint over the picture for the English dub and it really comes off as too blue or too dark in places, and sadly the Blu Ray keeps that. The Japanese version really looks more brighter and beautiful, and you could really tell the artists went to good effort in designing the buildings and city as they did actually go to Venice for that reason alone (I'd recommend finding a copy of the Japanese version to see what I mean). Other then that taint, the picture looks okay with maybe a little grain, the sound could be much better. You may need to turn up the volume if characters are speaking while music is playing.

Destiny Deoxys meanwhile really looks the part. Not only does the picture look very good, but like Heroes, the movie is finally in Widescreen and not Fullscreen like the DVD, which means you can finally see the whole picture. Sound is in 2.0 like Heroes, but sounds a tad bit better then Heroes.

No Extras sadly. The DVDs had plenty of Extras, but they are sadly missing here.

So is it worth your money? If you are a diehard Pokemon fan like myself, you'll probably buy it anyway, but if you are not too fussed about the picture or sound and like the English dubs, then its worth it to have these movies in widescreen at last, although there is another realease that has movies 4-7 on one disc, so you might want to pick that up instead. If picture and sound is important, then my best advise is to pick up the Japanese Blu Ray Boxset that has movies 1-13. Sure, its in Japanese, but you won't get better picture or sound till the next format comes along.

Another thing to note is this disc is region free, so it will work on UK Blu Ray Players as well as other countries. The other release, ""Pokemon Collection"", which has movies 4-7 is REGION LOCKED so you'll need a Region Free Blu Ray player if you want that one.

If this is for your kids, then I'm sure they won't notice the issues and enjoy both movies. Should be more then enough entertainment. ;)",1356739200,2,2711,4.2709551656920075
8440777,5,B004TP55WA,This movie is great for young kids who love Pokemon.  I am not sure it would work for teenagers.  My grandkids who are 10 and 5 love it!,1331424000,,136,3.8214285714285716
8440778,5,B004TP55WA,"Pros -- As many of you all know, Pokemon has never had a native HD transfer for any of its movies before now. Saying that, the picture for both movies is phenomenal. You may notice that since Pokemon Heroes is two movies older and uses mostly cell animation, the picture will not be as sharp looking as Destiny Deoxys being a digital animation. Literally, you can see the grain of the film and even distinguish distance shots of Pokemon and People with ease.

Now for the heavy...

Cons: Both Movies, do not have subtitles, original Japanese voice track, or any extras to speak of. If you were hoping for an HD transfer of the Pikachu short movies they will not come included. Additionally, unlike their dvd release, neither movie has 5.1 surround sound as an option, and just has very high quality stereo sound.

In conclusion, Seeing these two in HD was like watching them in a theater. I wish there were more Pokemon movies coming out in HD. Saying that, its unfortunate that they did not get the same content treatment as the DVD and I also wish they came as separate Bluray releases. If you just want the best possible visual and in my opinion, better sounding experience, this set is for you. If the lack of additional content is unbearable, you can try waiting until an inevitable re-release or just get the DVD version with full screen, 5.1, and all extras.

5 stars for the movies

1 star for everything else (has a nice animated menu) ^.^",1323388800,,1448,4.553846153846154
8440779,3,B004TP55WA,"This is the first pokemon movie in bluray there is to ever exist.

here is the basic flaw of the bluray.
Out of 10. where 10 is the highest and 1 is the lowest.

Quality: 7/10
The quality of both movies is super but not in its best format. I feel it is more like up-scaling from the dvd source but actually it is not. Yes, i believe Echo bridge is not using the best technology out there to do the transport/encode the movies. This is only a 25gb bluray. Anyway, the positive objective is that the quality is way better then the quality from the dvd and yes, both films are in 16:9 widescreen.

Sound: 4/10
Sound are only in 2.0 stereo. very basic...HELLO Echo bridge, this is a bluray and you are still in the 90s??

extra/feature: 1/10
Nothing!!!!!!!! 1 point for having a chapter menu.

overall i will rate this 5/10.

The dvd - has extra features(such as pikachu's short films, subtitle, multi languages, and 5.1 audio but not widescreen 16:9)

The bluray - nothing! just the film and chapter menu.

Buy this if you are looking for a higher quality(not the best) other then the dvd.",1305676800,5,1086,4.395
8440780,4,B004TP55WA,"An odd choice, movies 5 and 7 in a double-pack. What happened to Jirachi Wishmaker? If I were swapping my DVD collection to blu-ray, I'd rather have them paired in order, or compiled in a complete box set. The movies weren't the best in the Pokmon lineage but nonetheless seeing them in high definition would be a treat - especially if these releases include a dual-audio track with a Japanese option.",1302739200,,401,4.661971830985915
