8101699,2,B000CSEQZK,"This is one you can skip.  You get some references to Schwaller de Lubicz and Robert Temple (Sirius Mystery).  And then you get some impressions about how the outer parts of the temple were more memetic and so on.  So it's not bad, just not as good or impressionable as other episodes.  But then things go downhill.

After about half way through this episode we spend the most of the remaining time listening to Lon Milo Duquette.  You will either find him blaise or will just not appreciate it as he says nothing new or incredible.  Most of what he is talking about is not about Egypt but other esoteric orders such as Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, and other miscellany.

If you can rent this one, ok.  But it's not worth the full dvd entrance fee.",1391040000,4,750,4.455882352941177
