3894497,4,B002BFOZHQ,"I love this over-the-top show that ran on CBS from 1984-86 about a superchopper with capabilities beyond imagination that was stolen from Libya by recluse Vietnam veteran(Stringfellow Hawke) & his faithful pal from Vietnam(Dominic Santini) who continued to search for Strings long lost baby brother(St. John Hawke)who was missing in action since the end of the Vietnam war.

In fact, AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS on Sunday January 22nd, 1984 which was only a year prior to when the short-lived series STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC on Friday January 4th, 1985 & only a year & a half after KNIGHT RIDER with David Hasselhoff(Michael)made its debut on NBC on Sunday September 26th, 1982 which just so happened to be the same night the detective drama MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horseley made its debut on ABC back in the Fall of 1982.

Additionally, AIRWOLF was like the KNIGHT RIDER in choppers, turbo speeds, bullet proof, missiles, etc. and takes me back to memory lane to when AIRWOLF used to be on CBS's Saturday night line-up during KNIGHT RIDERs last 3 seasons on CBS's rival network NBC along with the fact that this show was in pretty hefty competition with KNIGHT RIDER during this shows 3-year run on CBS, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER still got better ratings than AIRWOLF did along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER had outlasted AIRWOLF nearly twice as long along with the fact that AIRWOLF wasn't as big of a smash as KNIGHT RIDER was despite the fact that AIRWOLF basically had more advantages to the Knight 2000 even though the advantages & disadvantages between KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF were quite equal.

Unfortunately, the premiere of newer shows like STREET HAWK led to decreased ratings on AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER since STREET HAWK was too closely related to AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend when STREET HAWK made its series premiere on ABC in the Winter of 1985 especially since STREET HAWK premiered too soon after KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF did even though STREET HAWK was originally scheduled to debut in the Fall of 1984, but flopped after only 3 1/2 months for the same reason AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER cancelled in the Spring of 1986.

The only major difference is USA had revived this series in the Winter of 1987 with a new cast & crew replacing Jan-Michael Vincent(Stringfellow Hawke), Ernest Borgnine(Dominic Santini), Alex Cord(Michael Archangel), & Jean Bruce Scott(Caitlyn O'Shaunessy) with St. John Hawke(Barry Van-Dyke), Geraint Wyn Davies(Major Michael Rivers), Tony Sherwood(Agent Jason Locke), Michelle Scarabelli(Jo Santini)back in January of 1987, but the revived series tanked after only 24 episodes leading to its cancellation in the Summer of 1987.

Something else I noticed about this superchopper series was in the last few episodes of AIRWOLF's 1st Season, Lance LeGault was the narrator at the very beginning of each episode explaining how Airwolf had been stolen by Hawke & Dominic & how Archangel had help design Airwolf & allowed Hawke to use it for the purpose to find Hawke's long lost kid brother St. John Hawke(Barry Van-Dyke)in exchange.

I don't understand why Universal feels a need to make a DVD box set of AIRWOLFs first 3 seasons in todays suffering economy, especially since it doesn't even include AIRWOLFs 4th & final season either.

Perhaps this is Universals way of either trying to make more money during these humble economic times or Universal just trying to make another complete series DVD box set like Universal has already done with KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, THE A-TEAM, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, etc.

As a matter of fact, Universal will be releasing THE A-TEAM:The Complete Series box set out on DVD this Summer on Tuesday June 8th, 2010.

By the way, the Shout Factory will be releasing the short-lived series STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach) out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 and Universal will finally be releasing AIRWOLFs 4th Season on DVD on Tuesday February 1st, 2011.",1269388800,2,3993,4.930059523809524

8361328,3,B002BFOZHQ,"This was the real AIRWOLF that started it all about a superchopper with capabilities beyond imagination that was stolen from Libya by a recluse Vietnam veteran named Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)who lived with his coon-hound dog out in a cabin in a remote area with priceless paintings who also loved to fish & play the cello as his hobbies while he and his faithful Vietnam buddy Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine)who continued to search for his long lost baby brother(St. John Hawke)who had been missing as an MIA since the end of the Vietnam war.

In fact, AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS on Sunday January 22, 1984 which was only a year before the short-lived supercycle drama STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC on Friday January 4, 1985 and AIRWOLF premiered only a year & a half before KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC on Sunday September 26, 1982 which coincidentally just happened to be the same night the detective drama MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horseley & Pamela Hensley made its debut on ABC.

Additionally, AIRWOLF was like the KNIGHT RIDER & STREET HAWK in choppers since AIRWOLF had turbo speeds, machine guns, missiles, bullet proof body armor, a laser, but AIRWOLF still wasn't as big of a smash as KNIGHT RIDER was & didn't last as long as KNIGHT RIDER did either, despite the fact that the advantages & disadvantages between the Knight 2000 & The Lady which was AIRWOLF were quite equal along with the fact that the idea of this show had to have been inspired by both KNIGHT RIDER & the short-lived superchopper series BLUE THUNDER which was led to cancellation by this show since AIRWOLF K.O.'d BLUE THUNDER in the Nielsen ratings.

Unfortunately, the premiere of newer shows like STREET HAWK led to this shows cancellation & an immense drop in ratings since STREET HAWK was too closely related to both KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend when STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach)made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985 & premiered too soon after AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS in the Winter of 1984 & KNIGHT RIDER with David Hasselhoff(Michael Knight)making its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 which not only resulted in STREET HAWK leading to its own cancellation in the Spring of 1985, but also led to the cancellation of AIRWOLF in the Spring of 1986 & KNIGHT RIDER in the Summer of 1986.

The only difference was te USA Network had ended up reviving this series in the Winter of 1987 with the ousting of the original cast & crew with only Jan-Michael Vincent appearing in the transitional episode of AIRWOLFs 4th Season for one last time when Dom is killed off in an explosion & gets replaced by Michelle Scarabelli as Dom's niece(Jo Santini)who inherits Santini Air from Dominic.  The hard-nosed Archangel(Alex Cord)was said to have suddenly been assigned overseas with the FIRM & got replaced by Agent Jason Locke(Anthony Sherwood) from a government agency called ""The Company"", but had no mention of String & Dom's sidekick Caitlyn O'Shannessy which was replaced by St. John's co-pilot(Maj. Mike Rivers)which was played by Geraint Wyn Davies.

In the meantime, Universal will be releasing AIRWOLF-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday February 1st, 2011 for all you AIRWOLF fans out there.",1289865600,4,3262,4.795373665480427
