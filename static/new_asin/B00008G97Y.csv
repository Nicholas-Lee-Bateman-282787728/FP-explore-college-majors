Marty (Rick Jordan) is a cab driver. He is looking for his 16 year old run away sister. This requires him to visit all the strip joints, sit in the front row and tip the strippers. It also forces, us the audience, to watch stripper after stripper. Yup, that's pretty much it.

This film has far more strippers than the first one. In fact there are very few moments when there are not a topless woman on film.

3 stars for the nudity.
