456248,5,6302281830,"After their resounding success in ""You'll Never Get Rich"" it was kismet that Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth would reunite for another glossy film musical. The project; ""You Were Never Lovelier"" is a valiant successor to the aforementioned and, in truth, excels beyond the expectations of that previous venture. Astaire plays a penniless hoofer from New York who, through a series of mishaps, comes to the attention of South American tycoon, Senior Acuna (Adolph Menjou) while on a vacation in Buenos Aires. Acuna has just married off his oldest daughter and, as his family tradition dictates, the rest of his daughters must get married in sequential order. The two youngest daughters are already fixed with a pair of tennis beaux, but the eldest unmarried daughter, Maria (Hayworth) is not only an ice princess of the highest order, but refuses to marry under any circumstance. That is, until she begins receiving orchids from an unknown admirer.
The score by Jerome Kern is magnificent; the poignant `Dearly Beloved', the jazzy `Shorty George' and the classy `I'm Old Fashion'. The latter two songs are danced by Astaire and Hayworth with such polish and finesse that it's impossible not to marvel at their grace and style.
Columbia Tristar's transfer of ""You Were Never Lovelier"" is outstanding. While ""You'll Never Get Rich"" suffered from an overall dated appearance, ""You Were Never Lovelier"" appears to have been the benefactor of a digital restoration at some point. It's black and white picture is stunning and smooth. There are brief and minor occasions where fine details slightly shimmer, but these do not distract from your visual pleasure. Fine detail is fully realized. There is a resounding absence of age related artifacts. Digital anomalies are not an issue. The audio is mono but exceptionally well balanced - at times sounding very close to having a stereo spread.
EXTRAS: Sorry, none!
BOTTOM LINE: ""You Were Never Lovelier"" has certainly never looked more lovely than in its DVD incarnation. An absolute must have for your library!",1109980800,9,2050,5.122388059701493

456250,5,6302281830,"A delightful comedic pairing of the ever-babilicious Rita Hayworth and the ever-dashing Fred Astaire... A followup to their earlier hit, ""You'll Never Be Rich.""  The pacing on this film is great -- it hardly drags at all, has a great ensemble and some genuinely funny routines.  The action is set in Argentina (although there's nary a bad accent to be heard in the entire film), and Latin bandleader Xavier Cugat provides all the musical backup.  He also gets a BIG speaking part -- if you really want to see Cugie in full swing, this movie is the one to check out!  His vocalist, the renowned Miguelito Valdes is also featured in a number at the film's start...  Astaire, of course, is also a wonder to behold; these songs aren't his best, but he still shines while performing them!  Recommended.",1041897600,3,797,4.697841726618705
456251,4,6302281830,"I think many people were surprised to learn that Hayworth, one of the screen's most beautiful pin-up girls, began as a dancer herself (and under a Latin name, yet). They were probably further surprised to learn that after Astaire and Rogers' stellar partnership, he would be able to find further success following the whirlwind RKO cycle. This movie, a Columbia baby rather than an RKO, comes awfully close to the same light and airy style of the earlier series- right down to the silky b/w photography. And the mistaken identity plot (SPOILER?!) does have an original flavor regarding the gimmick behind nightclub owner Adolphe Menjou: Hayworth plays his gorgeous daughter- the second oldest of four but the only one unattached, and the father's rule is that the girls marry in order of age. The oldest has just married, and Rita is next to be, but by refusing to fall in love under duress, she upsets the matrimonial apple cart. (The whole notion of her being 'frigid' or 'cold' is utter nonsense, but that was the Hollywood stereotype of an alluring and independent woman back then.) Enter Astaire, and some beautiful dance duets- including the tap-happy ""Shorty George"" and the stunning ballroom turn ""I'm Old Fashioned (radiantly staged in a moonlit garden and showing Hayworth off in a fluid black evening gown.)"" Hayworth certainly echoes the title of the film, and she and Astaire made for beautiful music in this second of their two films together.",1030665600,9,1457,4.951020408163266
456252,5,6302281830,"I highly recommend this film.  It has romance, drama, and some comedy.  Also the dance number done by Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth are so beautiful.  It's well worth seeing.",1018742400,3,175,4.766666666666667
456253,4,6302281830,"Musicals were very popular back in the 40's and this one is no exception. Flawless dancing and singing from beginning to end.  The plot goes like this: Rita Hayworth's father wants his daughter to cheer up and starts sending her love letters, pretending he's a young man who is interested in her. Confussion follows and Fred Astaire, who works for Rita's father, is mistaken for the one writing the love letters. The trouble is, he soon finds himself falling in love with the young woman. Get this film on a cold, rainy day and it will brighten up your life!",983491200,9,558,4.58
456254,5,6302281830,"If it were ever possible for audiences to forget that Fred Astaire ever  graced the dance floor with Ginger Rogers, it would have to be the film  ""You Were Never Lovelier.""  Featuring the stunning Rita Hayworth,  I believe it is the better of the Astaire/Hayworth collaborations, the  other being ""You'll Never Get Rich.""
A little note about the  plot, it's another one of those stories driven by mistaken identities that  incessantly frustrate the audience and makes them wonder ""Why won't  anybody speak up?"", but somehow the magnificent cast manages to pull  it off quite well.  The story does not lag, but moves along at a good pace.  Anyway, it does make way for some delightful musical numbers such as  Astaire's unforgettable solo for Acuna in Acuna's office (preluded by  Astaire declaring ""I hate dancing, but you're gonna watch me dance and  you're gonna like it.  Hit it, boys!""), Astaire and Hayworth dancing  to ""I'm Old-Fashioned"" in the garden and to ""Shorty  George"" later on during a rehearsal.  These two prove that they are in  excellent form and have left us a truly satisfying film.  If you're a  die-hard, Astaire/Rogers fanatic, you'll still like this film.  ""You  Were Never Lovelier"" definitely has more substance than the old RKO  films.  The only regret I have about these two is that Fred Astaire and  Rita Hayworth should have made more films together.",969062400,19,1381,4.921397379912664
456255,5,6302281830,"You Were Never Lovelier is a light, romantic musical with a great cast and wonderful songs. Hayworth plays Maria, a beautiful young girl whose family  wants her to marry. Her father, in an effort to get her in the right state  of mind for love, starts sending her flowers and notes purporting to be  from a secret admirer, hoping to melt her ""refrigerated"" heart.  Astaire, who plays a dancer (naturally *g*), gets mixed up in her father's  deceit--lies and misunderstandings follow. Never fear, all ends well (but  of course!). The supporting characters are perfect and add to the  atmosphere of the film and make it even more enjoyable. I especially liked  the very gay secretary who plays his part to perfection.
Hayworth is in  top form dancing in the numbers ""I'm Old Fashioned"" and  ""Shorty George"". I was more than impressed by her beauty and  grace. Astaire's best part in the film is when he does a difficult dance  number in Maria's father's office and makes it look easy, as per usual.",965174400,7,996,4.726744186046512

456293,5,6302281830,Excellent title for Rita!  Love this film with Rita and Fred dancing up a storm..  He was the best dancer ever in Hollywood and I believe the same of Rita being best female dancer.  She just floated through her films and was beautiful too.  1987 was a sad year as we lost them both but we really lost her years before due to the dreadful Alzheimer's disease.  She was blessed to have her daughter Princess Yasmin to see to her care in later years.,1480809600,2,447,4.273809523809524

And I do not remember any warning on the seller's spot.  And I did see warnings on several other sellers' ads.  The disc cost less than $4.  I carefully bought a copy from someone else that I think will play ($14 this time).  However, I found out from a friend of mine who is a computer tech that region 2 will play okay on a computer.  He was right, and it does.  If I was right and there is no warning and if this CD had cost very much and if it did not or I did not know it would play alright on a comp, I would have been very upset at having been duped into buying a disc I couldn't play and being stuck with the hassle of returning it for a refund.",1465430400,,784,3.766871165644172
456298,3,6302281830,"Watch Fred Astaire dance with Rita Hayworth to Latin rhythms with Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer ""I'm Old-Fashioned"" tune; watch them both tap-dancing to ""The Shorty George"" number which was more delightful I think than the first dance; and then watch Fred Astaire perform an incredible solo tap dance where he is supposed to audition to a mule-headed impresario who refuses to hire him on account of Astaire's criticism of his daughter. This tap dance, where he moves on top of desks and chairs and even uses an umbrella is just incredible. I wonder how long it took him to rehearse all that. Besides the Astaire-Hayworth duets and Astaire's solo tap dancing, Astaire and Hayworth have their turn singing a melody each, and they are always accompanied by Xavier Cugat's Latin band, which must have been very popular back then in Hollywood. Five stars for the musical scenes and the dancing stars in this film.

Plot-wise, the story does not have the qualities of Director Mark Sandrich's movies with Astaire and Rogers. One misses the flow of events in these earlier films. Nevertheless, the film turns out to be quite funny and entertaining. Astaire, who happens to play a dancer visiting Argentina, runs out of money at horse races and decides to visit an impresario for a dancing job, only to discover that he is an inaccessible, intractable negotiator. The impresario happens to be the father of the ""girl"" in the movie, Rita Hayworth. As often happens in screwball comedies, there is an initial dislike between the two. But once Hayworth listens to Astaire sing and accidentally receives an orchid with a romantic note from him (originally written by her own father), she starts to feel an attraction; and once Astaire ends up courting her by accident or through her father's plans, his mind and heart starts warming toward her. After this, the plot-twists get funnier (one of the funniest twists has to do with the name of Maria, Rita's name in the movie and also her aunt's name). Although missing the witty dialogues from the Astaire-Rogers movies, this film does what a good movie ought to do. At least, it did it for me. Along with Astaire and Hayworth, Adolphe Menjou does a supporting role as father of Rita's Maria.

The film transfer on the DVD was quite neat and of excellent quality.",1464566400,3,2295,4.8520408163265305

This review is for ""You Were Never Lovelier,"" starring Fred Astaire & Rita Hayworth

I think I have seen almost all of Fred Astaire's movies.  In my opinion, this is without question the best!  I was never really a fan of Rita Hayworth.  I cannot sing her praises enough due to her performances in this delight movie.  Mr. Astaire, of course, delivered his usual flawless performances adding to the enchantment of this film.  I really have nothing to add to the review of this film that has not already been said.

I do have a question:  why is this not on Instant Video?  I do have the DVD but would still love to have it on Instant to add to my collection online.  Amazon, please put this on Instant Video.  Thanks!",1363305600,2,880,5.304347826086956

456441,4,6302281830,"Reuniting Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth after the previous year's You'll Never Get Rich set tills a ringing, 1942's visibly much bigger budgeted You Were Never Lovelier is just the kind of high quality studio-produced escapist fluff that audiences craved in the war years. A remake of Agentinian comedy Los Martes Orquideas/On Tuesdays, Orchids, the plot is one of those contrived mistaken identity south of the border trifles: determined that his daughters will only marry in chronological order but despairing that Hayworth will ever fall in love because of her impossibly high standards, Adolphe Menjou creates an imaginary secret admirer for her only for her to get the idea that it's Fred Astaire's dancer who's badgering him for a spot in his hotel. All of which is just an excuse to get the stars together for some musical numbers, light romance and comic misunderstandings, with Menjou and onscreen wife Barbara Brown alternating on deflating quip duties from the sidelines and Xavier Cugat fulfilling occasional sidekick duties as well as providing a few numbers with his band.

Despite claims of Jerome Kern's best score since Show Boat on the posters (with lyrics were this time the work of Johnny Mercer), the musical numbers are a bit hit and miss, though the Shorty George duet is a fine bit of terpsichory, with Hayworth holding her own impressively with Astaire - while her singing may be very effectively dubbed by Nan Wynn but the dancing is all her, and she looks like she's really loving every second of it. There's a very, very obvious cut in the title number, which ends rather abruptly after preview audiences were unimpressed by the dance number it segued into but otherwise the picture does exactly what you expect with enough smooth professionalism and Hollywood studio system glamour not to disappoint. It may not be either Astaire or Hayworth's best, but it's no surprise that this was reportedly its beautiful leading lady's favorite film.",1361404800,,1969,5.039877300613497

456445,4,6302281830,"You Were Never Lovelier(released Nov/42)stars Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth in their second and last collaboration together. It is a lovely and enchanting picture,filled with romance,a myriad of mix ups,with a boy meets girl,loses girl,regains girl and larger than life characters,more typical of an Astaire/Rogers film. I think it is the closest he would ever get to capturing that same kind of spark on film. In this one Rita now looks a little more confident than she did in You'll never Get Rich.
The plot involves hoofer Fred who has come to Buenos Aires for a change of scenery and to get a job at a club owned by one Eduardo Acuna. He can`t for the life of him get any alone time with Mr Acuna until a band leader friend of his working for the club(Xavier Cugat) gets him a job singing with the band. At the gig he goes outside for some fresh air as does Rita. It`s not love at first sight for either of them as Fred makes a disparaging remark about her father. He in turn returns inside to finally speak to Mr Acuna and says Rita acts like a cold refrigerator. How embarrassed he is when he is told she is his daughter. He`s just insulted two Acuna`s in one evening!
Fred the next day returns to Acuna`s office to apologize but still can`t get a foot in the door. When Acuna`s male receptionist leaves the room Acuna shouts out an order over the intercom to get a delivery boy to take some orchids to his home. Mr Acuna had just gotten one daughter recently married off and he has two younger daughters chomping at the bit to wed also,but Rita is holding up the works. Acuna is secretly writing love notes from an unknown admirer and sending them to his daughter along with orchids to get her in the mood.
Fred shakes his head and decides to do the job but when he does Rita takes him for her secret admirer and she falls hard for him. Fred has been ambivalent about Rita up until this but he is slowly starting to warm up to the idea of his love for her. We all know it`s inevitable and just a matter of time,all but Fred of course. Fred returns Acuna`s change to him and the two don`t exactly hit it off.
At home Acuna learns of Rita`s affections towards Fred. Acuna naturally wants what he thinks is best for her and Fred is not part of the deal. He persuades/leans on Fred to make himself uninteresting to her. The more Fred tries to cut things short the more the two get closer. One night at a party for Acuna`s 25th wedding anniversary,which Fred was invited to by Rita and her god mother,not by Acuna himself,Acuna and Fred have words in his home office. Acuna orders Fred to leave town the next day,which Fred reluctantly agrees is the best thing. The whole affair and mix ups have gotten to him anyways. Acuna says he will write a lovely farewell note to his daughter so at least his daughter won`t linger with a bad memory of Fred.
Fred leaves the office,but in the meantime his wife enters and overhears him talking back out loud what he just wrote in the note. Immediately she assumes he has had an affair with Rita`s godmother. All heck breaks loose as Acuna becomes coy,not wanting to reveal the truth in front of his daughter. Fred hears about the ruckus and goes back in to explain that the note was intended for his daughter and nothing more than that. Fred also plays it coy,getting Acuna out of a big jam but not letting the entire truth out about her fathers intentions nor his real feelings towards Rita. Rita walks out in disgust.
At a tete a`tete Fred and Acuna have later,Acuna has now finally reversed his feelings for him,for what he did for him. He now heartily approves of him staying and actively pursuing his daughter. With a little song,music and finally dancing Rita,is won over and the two live happily ever after.
The last dance number representing the two finally joining as one really cements the Astaire/Rogers feel of the film. Rita does a great job in her footwork with Fred and Fred has some terrific solo work off and on,especially his debut hoofing for Acuna in his office. I gasped,as Fred threw an umbrella perfectly against a wall which fell beautifully into a stand on the floor below. This trick would be used to greater effect later in Funny Face. Fred`s other co-star Adolphe Menjou is an absolute delight. Adolphe was a veteran of both silent and sound pictures and was always a great supporting actor in everything he did,and this is no exception. He brings just the right dynamic in his portrayal of the manipulative and domineering father. Tune smith Jerome Kern is on hand for the music but the only two memorable songs are I`m Old Fashioned and Dearly Beloved. Xavier Cugat and his band are on hand to provide more than enough Latin flavour for two movies.
Technically the film looks clear and crisp and in much better shape than the Astaire/Hayworth predecessor You`ll Never Get Rich. There are no extras.
All in all a very good film showing some of that Astaire/Rogers sparkle from less than 10 years before,with the same romanticism,plot and dancing one would expect from those films. This is the best of the two Rita/Fred collaborations. Recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1337212800,2,5133,4.526372443487621

456470,4,6302281830,"I have yet to find an Astaire dancing/music film that matches the magic of the Astaire/Rogers team.  But Rita Hayworth comes close.

Synopsis:

The story is cute but overly long.  The father of several daughters wants his girls to marry in order, from the oldest to youngest. After the oldest does get married the younger ones get on the girl next in line -- the cold Maria who wants nothing to do with love and marriage.

To ""help"" his daughter, the father pretends to be an admirer of Maria's, copying poetry from books on love letters, etc.  Pretty creepy, actually.

Meanwhile Robert (Astaire) is losing money on the tracks in Buenos Aires.  It's not clear why he left New York, perhaps to bet on the racetracks down there.  He meets up with his friend Xavier Cugat and they try to get into the father's club.

Yeah the story is convoluted but it eventually gets us some music and dancing from Astaire and Hayworth.  The most impressive of these Johnny Mercer numbers was the title of the film, You Were Never Lovelier.

Bottom Line:  Somewhat entertaining, but really, Fred & Ginger really had a staying power that I don't see with Rita -- who does not make a bad comedienne, but her later serious dramatic roles in other films is where she really excelled.

Trivia:  1942 nomination for Best Song, Best Musical and Best Sound.

456471,4,6302281830,"The first paragraph below is taken from other reviews about Rita Hayworth although the male stars are different here, except they all have a similar feature; they all are smitten very smitten by Ms. Hayworth's charms. Join the line, boys:

""Okay, let me bring you up to speed on the obscure meaning of the headline. See, a while back I was smitten by a film star, an old time black and white film star from the 1940s, Rita Hayworth. The film that sent me into a tailspin: the black and white <em>noir</em> classic Gilda where she played a ""good"" femme fatale who gets in a jam with a no good monomaniacal crook. But that part is not important femme fatales, good or bad, get mixed up with wrong gees all the time. It's an occupational hazard. What is important though is that I got all swoony over lovely, alluring Rita. And as happens when I get my periodic ""bugs"" I had to go out and see what else she performed in. Of course Lady From Shang-hai came next. There she plays a ""bad"" blondish femme fatale (against a smitten Orson Welles).""

And now this film under review, You Were Never Lovelier. We are caught up.

Now the plot line here, the never-ending boy meets girl plot line that Hollywood mass-produced (and mass-produces) is pretty simple, except that it takes place in Buenos Aires (although the twelve dollars spent on fake stage place-settings made me think of little white houses with picket fences in Indiana, or some place like that). When all is said and done, despite the machinations of Maria's (Rita Hayworth) father (Adophe Menjou) Broadway show dance man Fred Astaire is smitten, very smitten (join the line, the now long line, Fred) by her ""Spanish"" charms and her sweet coquettishness. And from there the hi-jinks really begin as all parties, wives, aunts, sisters, Christ, even grandma, and a much put upon father's business assistant try to get this pair matched up. And as these Hollywood boy meet girl things often turn out, we will hear wedding bells before the end.

But forget the story line really. This thing, like almost all Fred Astaire vehicles, and righteously so, is strictly about Fred's dancing, dancing alone, dancing with a partner, dancing up a wall (oops that was another film) but dancing with so much style it is impossible to keep your eyes off him (saying how did he do that all the while). For style, grace, and physical moves every one of those guys you see on shows like Dancing With The Stars, well, just tell them to move on over, and watch a real pro. Hey, wait a minute, what about Rita? Ya, what about her. Here she is just along for the ride, although less so than in the previously reviewed You'll Never Get Rich. She is more in synch here with Fred's moves but it is still Fred's dancing which draws the eye. As I noted before though, she, however, has other charms, okay.

Note: The music of Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer need no further comment, nor does the work of band leader Xavier Cugat. These are all pros from the old Tin Pan Alley music days of the American songbook. Enough said",1292716800,2,3048,4.575091575091575
456472,5,6302281830,"All the elements of a Fred Astaire and Dancing Partner movie are present here.  He is once again hard up for money and trying to make a living as a ""hoofer"".  As fate would have it, he finds himself mistaken for the unidentified romantic fellow who has won over Rita Hayworth's ice cold heart.  Her father is less than pleased at the outcome, but eventually everything gets resolved nicely.  My favorite scenes were the ones where Rita Hayworth's character completely freezes out Fred Astaire.  She does it so well!  This is everything one can hope for in a movie.  Very clever lines and twists.  And likeable dance scenes.  I still maintain I like Ginger Rogers' dancing better, but Rita Hayworth definitely does an excellent job.",1289779200,,731,4.784
456473,5,6302281830,"These old movies with dancers like Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, etc. are just wonderful to watch. Such grace. Easier on the eyes than todays dancers....",1276560000,,152,5.12
456474,5,6302281830,"You Were Never Lovelier boasts terrific song and dance numbers performed by Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth; and the acting is very convincing throughout the picture. The cinematography and the choreography shine--especially in those dance scenes. Fred Astaire is in excellent form here; and even if he isn't dancing with Ginger Rogers you'll see quite a match in Rita Heyworth! The script was well written and there's just enough comic relief (especially by Gus Schilling as Mr. Acua's assistant) to make the film truly and completely enjoyable. The quality of the print is excellent, too.

When the action starts, we meet a famous American dancer who is temporarily down and out, Robert 'Bob' Davis (Fred Astaire); he is Buenos Aires, Argentina on vacation. When Robert loses just a bit too much money at the racetrack, Bob must find work fast--and he goes to a hotel in Buenos Aires owned by the stuffy and highly irritable Eduardo Acua (Adolph Menjou). Unfortunately once again, Robert can't even get by Acua's assistant, Fernando (Gus Schilling); and that certainly leaves Robert in a jam. How will he get to Mr. Acua and apply for a job in the hotel nightclub with Xavier Cugat & His Orchestra?

At the same time, things are heating up in the Acua household. The eldest of four daughters, Julia (Catherine Craig), is marrying--and now according to Acua tradition the very independent minded second oldest daughter, Maria, must marry next. This causes much angst for Maria's two younger sisters, Cecy (Leslie Brooks) and Lita (Adele Mara) because they have already chosen the men they wish to marry--but their weddings cannot take place until Maria, who will not rush, gets married first. Through a few mistaken identities and misunderstandings, however, Eduardo Acua unwittingly sets up the man he can't stand, Robert Davis, to pose as the fellow who has been sending dozens of beautiful orchids to Maria. In actuality, Eduardo has been sending those orchids to his daughter Maria all along, preparing her for a suitor that he himself deems worthy of Maria. Eduardo is callous, too--even when he sees that Maria has true feelings for Robert, he thinks nothing of telling Robert to get out of Argentina and fly home. Acua wants Robert to break Maria's heart and tell her that he only wanted her for the job at Acua's hotel nightclub, which, of course, is very far from true because Robert and Maria are in love.

What happens next is anybody's guess, although perhaps you can see the resolution coming anyway in spite of a few unexpected plot twists near the end of the film. In any event, prepare to be dazzled with superlative song and dance scenes; I won't forget them anytime soon! Xavier Cugat & His Orchestra are also featured brilliantly; I love their performances in this film as well. Look also for Barbara Brown as Eduardo's wife Delfina Acua; and Isobel Elsom plays Maria Castro very well.

The DVD doesn't come with any extras. I would have liked something but I'm afraid we come up empty.

You Were Never Lovelier is a classic and the dancing is impeccable--after all, who can beat Fred Astaire at dancing? Rita Hayworth dances magnificently as well. I highly recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie; and of course people who enjoy classic movie musicals will not be disappointed.",1258156800,,3309,4.89126559714795

456476,4,6302281830,"This movie is appropriately titled, as it's hard to imagine a woman more breathtakingly beautiful than Rita Hayworth in the early 1940's. The fact that she was an accomplished dancer - reportedly Fred Astaire's favorite partner - only adds to her ethereal, otherworldly appeal. Their second and sadly last pairing in this lightweight 1942 confection hardly does justice to either star, but it's a pleasant enough romantic comedy highlighted by just two numbers where they dance together. Those unparalleled moments are worth slogging through the silly plot co-penned by Michael Fessier, Ernest Pagano, and Delmer Daves.

Directed by studio journeyman William A. Seiter, the film has American hoofer Bob Davis in Buenos Aires losing his savings at the racetrack. Looking for work, he seeks a chance to audition for hotel owner Eduardo Acuna. Enlisting the help of bandleader Xavier Cugat (Charo's future husband) and his orchestra, he fails to impress Acuna. However, through various plot machinations including mistaken identity and parental scheming, Bob meets and becomes smitten with Acuna's headstrong daughter Maria, who has decided she will never marry. This upsets her two giggly younger sisters who cannot marry their respective sweethearts until Maria marries. The resolution to this dilemma is predictable, but it is all wrapped in a soundtrack that combines Latin rhythms and sonorous songs by Jerome Kern. One of the composer's best, the ber-romantic ""I'm Old-Fashioned"", provides the film's unequivocal high point as Hayworth lip syncs the classic chestnut to Nan Wynn's dusky alto and moves into a graceful pas de deux with Astaire peppered with a Latin-flavored interlude.

On the other end of the spectrum is the be-bop delight, ""Shorty George"" where a bobby-socked Hayworth tap dances with impressive abandon as she matches Astaire step for step. Astaire's artistry goes without saying, although Bob is pretty much like every hapless character he played in all those movies with Ginger Rogers. At 24, Hayworth is such a serene object of desire as Maria that it's no wonder Astaire's character is rendered speechless and asks her to turn around to avoid further embarrassment. Adolphe Menjou is his usual pompous blowhard as Acuna though hardly believable as an Argentinean, while Cugat seems far more at ease with a baton than with a script. Compared with their 1941 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ll-Never-Get-Rich/dp/B00000F9GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You'll Never Get Rich</a>, this movie has a more fanciful tone without the wartime context, but the highlights are less frequent. This was Hayworth's favorite film, and apparently a fifteen-year-old Fidel Castro is among the extras. The 2004 DVD offers no additional features.",1238630400,,2804,5.610849056603773

456478,5,6302281830,"Throughout the forties, Rita Hayworth proved she could play sultry temptresses (Blood and Sand, Gilda, The Loves of Carmen), yet be equally adept and endearing in musical comedies. Not many actresses could pull off both extremes convincingly, but Rita's authenticity permeated either role .

No wonder the major studios in Hollywood were vying for her services. They knew the young star had a special quality that lit up the screen. With a simple gesture, casual hair toss or even the subtlest dance move, Hayworth could generate enormous power, leaving other actresses in the dust.

Imagine how excited fans were in 1942, especially America's servicemen, - having one of their favorite pin-ups dance and emote with Fred for the second time in ""You Were Never Lovelier"".

Astaire had many famous partners in his long career, but no one registered the sheer thrill of dancing with him like Rita did. It was clear Rita adored Fred, and the feeling was mutual. Combining major star power, talent and truckloads of ""it"" factor, Fred and Rita radiated a genuine sense of joy, transforming already great routines into something timeless.

The two standout numbers are the romantic and elegant ""I'm Old Fashioned"", and the delightfully informal, yet intricate ""Shorty George"", featuring a casually clad Rita looking knockout gorgeous in her tennis outfit.

I've watched these routines over 100 times, and they never get tired. There's so much going on and lots to take in.

Astaire is a marvel. His crack timing and level of professionalism are astounding. Charismatic and surefooted, Fred never cheated and always maintained full control, displaying his rare ability to make complex routines seem casual and fun.

Then there's Hayworth. When it comes to pure screen charisma, Rita is unrivaled. Even today, nobody could touch her. A ravishing beauty with a rare, feline grace, Rita was captivating. Even her loose flowing hair seemed to be dancing; whipping and snapping back against her head after a quick turn, or slowly cascading down, finding a temporary home on a raised shoulder, framing her smiling, beaming face in exciting ways.

Hayworth's charm was extremely potent. Mysterious and thrilling all at once, and at times, startling, Rita creates a cinematic nirvana that acts like a drug; you're thrust into a world that is unreal, ecstatic and wonderful. We are only humbled by it.

Entranced, we attempt to analyze her appeal - but it's like trying to contemplate the universe.  Hayworth's allure is undefinable, inexplicable, propelling her to another dimension - a dream-like, limbo that exists only in the sub-conscious, for only there can we gaze upon her beauty without losing our sanity.",1233792000,5,2697,5.165137614678899

456519,5,6302281830,"This sparkling 1942 film, the second and last teaming of Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth, is a jewel in the crown of Columbia musicals. Although Astaire regretted that his films with Hayworth were never shot in color due to the studio's wartime budget, it's glorious in its black and white presentation. Rita's wardrobe will arouse envy and admiration in female viewers, as I'm sure it did upon its original release.

Dancer Robert Davis (Astaire) wishes to work for crusty Buenos Aires business man Eduardo Acuna (Adolpe Menjou), but Davis puts his foot in his mouth far too often at the wedding of Eduardo's eldest daughter Julia. The next daughter Maria (Hayworth), is to marry next, but she has no prospects at the moment and is in no hurry. That is not the case with her two younger sisters (Leslie Brooks and Adele Mara), who want to marry their ""tennis playing Romeos"" (one of whom, is Larry Parks, uncredited, who went on to costar with Hayworth in ""Down To Earth"" in 1947). But Papa decrees that Maria must wed first, but her disinterest in the young men around her does nothing to hasten matrimony. So he comes up with an inspired idea - creating a secret admirer, who writes Maria romantic notes and sends her orchids. He then decides to hire a fellow to impersonate his creation, hoping that his daughter will fall for him. When Robert inadvertently ends up delivering the next order of orchids to the Acuna house, Maria spies him from above and thinks that he is her secret admirer. Eduardo grudgingly allows Maria to believe Davis is her suitor, and the hoofer finds himself falling for her and discovering that there is an old-fashioned gal underneath her ice princess exterior. The truth ultimately is exposed but true love conquers all in a wonderful, exhilarating romantic finale.

The dance numbers are sensational - ""The Shorty George"" is my favorite. ""Dearly Beloved"" and ""I'm Old Fashioned"" are wistfully enchanting, and there is tremendous comic relief throughout - Gus Schilling as Eduardo's nervous secretary Fernando nearly steals the scene from Astaire and Menjou. Jerome Kern's score and Xavier Cugat and his orchestra is a perfect accompaniment to ""You Were Never Lovelier"".

Astaire and Hayworth were every bit as accomplished a team as Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Both of their performances seem so effortless and it's clear that they worked well and had tremendous respect for each other. Hayworth is as always, breathtakingly beautiful.

There were more gasps during those incomparable Astaire-Hayworth dance numbers!! The ""I'm Old Fashioned"" and ""The Shorty George"" dances are among the best EVER filmed.

Certainly Rita was among Fred's best partners, if not THE BEST...together they fly through their dance numbers flawlessly...their tap routines in BOTH films they did together are the most complicated I've ever seen, yet they are excecuted with such grace, ease, and absolute joy!!! It's quite clear that Astaire & Hayworth liked each other very much.
