When they stopped airing the program I was disappointed then relieved when I found this DVD.I bought both volumes from Amazon and the results are fantastic,if you like to challenge yourself then this DVD  is for you,I used to have a bulging tummy and in 2 weeks I can already see massive improvement. I recommend this to anyone who is on a life changing mission and I can assure you, you will not regret this purchase.",1364428800,,505,4.611111111111111
8258182,5,B0015EA63Q,Great workout very quick. I watched (and worked out with) the series when it was on Lifetime.  I wish they would release more of the episodes.,1335830400,,142,4.461538461538462
8258183,4,B0015EA63Q,"I have purchased vol. 2 twice and both were of poor quality.  However, Vol. 1 is very good quality.  Vol. 2 has some awsome workouts and I really benefited from them.  Too bad they were poor quality.",1226534400,,199,4.324324324324325
8258184,5,B0015EA63Q,"This dvd has some great workouts. Not as much cardio as I like but the toning is wonderful. These two trainers are fantastic. They really know how to make you work hard in the short amount of time they have with you. I watched the show when it was on t.v. and I loved it! When I saw they were making dvd's of the show I just had to get them. I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting a toning workout! The Volume 1 has more cardio workouts than this one, so if your looking for more cardio check out volume 1.",1216339200,,517,4.029126213592233
8258185,5,B0015EA63Q,"I just recieved my order from Podfitness.com and I'm just loving these workouts.  The company was very fast with their shipping and the DVD quality was great but then I may be a little biased because I remember these workouts when they were on the Lifetime Channel and followed the show daily because they did what few fitness shows could,...Get me motivated again.  I was heartbroken when the show was taken off so I was thrilled to find out these were available on DVD.

 One thing to keep in mind is that because these were previously on TV, there is a little bit of a gap in between segments (20 to 30 seconds) but this is a minor thing that I can work around with no problem because all I do is just keep moving.

  If they were to release future volumes (which I hope they will),
I would buy them on the spot.

  The workouts themselves are easy to follow yet very effective and you can grow with them. The trainers are very encouraging.
I consider myself a recycled beginner and on my good days I'm between the levels of an advanced beginner to low intermediate  Even solid intermediates and some advanced exerciser will enjoy this DVD.",1212364800,,1143,4.447115384615385
8258186,5,B0015EA63Q,"Both these videos, volume 1 and volume 2, contain the TV workouts that finally jump started my weight loss. No other TV fitness instruction was able to achieve that. I was disappointed when Lifetime decided to take it off the air, but I'm grateful to have my own videos now. You can't beat video instruction.",1207094400,2,308,4.618181818181818
8258187,5,B0015EA63Q,"I missed this show when it was taken off the air and have been waiting for the DVDs.  I have enjoyed the challenging workouts once again.  The only disappointing things are that without the commercials the routines are only about 20 minutes and that my main DVD player (which won't play burned DVDs), won't play these.  I am forced to exercise elsewhere.  In any case they are great, I'll get more!",1207008000,,398,4.563380281690141
8258188,5,B0015EA63Q,"This DVD, along with Volume 1, provide the best workouts.  I like how you are not stuck doing just a certain body part per DVD, but get five different workouts, just like when the show was on TV.  Shame on a certain network for cancelling - these workouts are much better than the Denise Austin ones!  Highly recommended.",1205884800,2,321,4.5
