8000728,5,1419815644,Decided to bite the bullet and buy this as my local P(athetic) Broadcasting Station stopped showing it and Amazon Prime pulled it. Glad I did. Much better video quality than my local broadcast!  Also the vendor was fairly local to me so it showed up in two days!,1435190400,5,262,4.458333333333333
