2796647,5,B000OIOXOC,"If you like Harvey Walden - it is really a fun workout. If you've never heard of him or seen him in action, you may not like it. I did the 50 minute workout segment and it was a fantastic workout. Takes very little room, no equipment, and it was not hard to catch on to the moves.",1216512000,3,280,3.8448275862068964
2796648,4,B000OIOXOC,"I ordered the DVD on Wed., was promised Friday delivery, rec'd it on Thur.  I tried it right away & enjoyed the workout & am looking forward to doing it again & again.  I only gave four stars because Harvey does tend to talk too much & one must pay close attention, as the instructions he gives sometimes get lost in the trash talk.  Ummmm Harvey?  SHHHHHHHHH!!!

Overall, a good workout.  Summertime, here I come!",1209686400,,414,4.453333333333333
2796649,5,B000OIOXOC,"Its pretty much what I expected. It starts out slow & works you out up to ""3rd gear"". I like the workout, I feel the burn and its much better than the Extreme Fat Smash diet book I bought along with this DVD.

Harvey Walden--the drill instructor from Celebrity Fit Club, is a great motivator. And yeah Harvey ----I feel the fat melting off this gorgeous body!

I hope Harvey comes out with another DVD workout soon--I would buy it for sure!",1208217600,5,440,4.353658536585366
2796680,4,B000OIOXOC,"You actually get a good workout.  Harvey's antics are hilarious, so if you can tune him out and concentrate on moving then you get a sufficient workout.  It's not overly difficult but it's also not really easy either.  It gets your heart pumping and you feel the movements if you do them right.  I like that there is a 30 and 50 min workout and you can tell the difference between the two.",1362441600,,389,4.287671232876712
2796681,5,B000OIOXOC,I loved this workout! I lost my first DVD a few years back and am starting to get fit again so here I am to buy this again! That's how great it is! Def works!,1361404800,,158,3.5428571428571427
2796682,5,B000OIOXOC,i bought Harvey's first fitness video and has used it on and off and have found it great. all that he said in his video is true and i just like the way that he pushes people to achieve their goals and it really works if you dedicated yourself to it.,1357344000,,249,3.9019607843137254
2796683,5,B000OIOXOC,Harvey is a great inspiration. This is a DVD well worth the money. You will get the excerise you need with this DVD.,1348531200,,116,4.086956521739131
2796684,4,B000OIOXOC,"Found this DVD to be just about right for my level of fitness to expire me to keep moving.  Only did the first level.  I assume the next level is more of a ""Boot Camp"".",1347580800,,168,3.7714285714285714
2796685,5,B000OIOXOC,I purchased this video from Amazon because I lost the original one I bought years ago.  It is a good workout and easy for anyone.,1301184000,,129,4.16
2796686,5,B000OIOXOC,"I bought this DVD several years ago && incorporated it into my regular gym routine. Mon/Wed/Fri - gym, Tues/Thurs - Harvey. I absolutely loved it && still do! Coming from a military home && background, I'm used to && quite enjoy his tear u down to build u back up style. When I first began using this DVD (originally && again after I broke my ankle due to an unrelated accident), I was pleased to see, not only a beginner version (Tracy), but also an advanced version (Michelle). While I've never been able to do push ups on my fingertips like Michelle, it's still nice to see that it's an option. I prefer the 30min version, because I do work out for several hrs on Mon/Wed/Fri, but the extended version is definitely not a disappointment. When I originally began using this DVD, I was about 50lbs overweight, but w/ Harveys help, && pushing myself @ the gym, I lost that weight && more in about 6months. Do yourself a favor, if u can handle tough love, buy the DVD!",1298764800,,967,4.407821229050279
2796687,4,B000OIOXOC,"I have a health issue that forced me to totally re-evaluate my diet and also begin exercising seriously. I live in an area where there is *zero* gym access so I knew DVD workouts would supplement my walking regime. I have acquired probably a dozen different workouts (cardio and toning-no step, minimal weight training) and heard about the ""Celebrity Fit Club Workout"" from another source. I bought it and I really like it. Boredom and staying motivated are big challenges for me at my age and Harvey definitely has no problem keeping my focus on the workout. The variety of going quickly from exercise to exercise is another big plus for me. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is wanting to ""step up"" their workout without having to do a lot of possibly joint risking activity.",1291766400,,792,4.746376811594203
2796688,5,B000OIOXOC,"I love Harvey and I loved watching Celebrity Fit Club. I've been doing this tape for 30 minutes for 4 days. I'm also doing the Slim Fast 3-2-1 diet and have been doing that for 4 days too. So Far with the exercise and dieting I've lost 6 Pounds! It's working wonderfully! Harvey is funny in this video. I love his rude comedy. He does give you a work out. You can either choose between a 30 or 50 minute workout. They also have a modified version for beginners. I've been doing that one so far. It's awesome! You can feel it the next day. So you know it really works! Just use it everyday and at least a 1/2 hour, and Diet and it would work for you too! I love this!",1286668800,4,666,4.015037593984962
2796689,5,B000OIOXOC,"Great home workout.....I highly recommend this dvd. The workout is great for beginners (follow Tracey) and for the more advanced (follow Michelle). The 50 minute session will definitely get your heart pumping and the sweat flowing! My only complaint is the use of a few foul words by the drill instructor, Harvey.",1281744000,,313,5.038461538461538
2796720,4,B000OIOXOC,"I love this workout DVD!... I actually bought this a couple years back and used it and loved it.  More recently, it jus became worn and at one point just stopped working- I went nuts!! Lol... And, of course, Amazon came through with a great buy. I am once again workin out to my fav DVD ;-)",1280793600,,290,4.087719298245614
2796721,5,B000OIOXOC,The item is awesome and the perk is I get too see Harvey's face when ever I want.  Deliver service is great.,1274918400,,108,3.909090909090909
2796722,4,B000OIOXOC,"This video is good.  Harvey is very motivating.  My only negative comment is that the music doesn't really sync to the beat, all the participants in the video are kind of moving to their own timing.  This is true to a ""boot camp"" format as it is not done to music at all, but for those of us that are used to traditional aerobics set to music with an 8-count beat, it makes you feel out of step.",1271894400,,395,4.038461538461538
2796723,5,B000OIOXOC,"As A fan of Harvey and Celebrity Fit Club, I just had to check out this DVD. Boy am I glad I did. I found Harvey to be motivating in his special way and I really worked up A sweat. I appreciated the fact that not only could you choose between A short or long workout, but also got to choose the music. Options for the music being Rock/Alternative or Dance music. The Rock adds even more energy for me to get through to the end. I recommend this to any fan of Harvey's bootcamp workouts.",1267142400,3,486,4.072916666666667
2796724,5,B000OIOXOC,"I'm a big fan of boot-camp style workouts and this is definitely a new favorite!  You can pick between a 30-minute or a 50-min workout and between dance/pop and alternative/rock background music.  The workout is in 30 second intervals:  30 seconds of marching, jogging, running, or jumping jacks alternating with a targeted exercise).  The marching/running portions are broken into 3 ""gears.""  As the workout progresses, the gear increases.  Be forewarned:  this workout is NON-STOP!! Absolutely no breaks (actually, the marching gear might feel like a break, but just wait 'til you start running!!)

The moves are basic and easy to follow.  There's also a modifier for beginners (that ACTUALLY does real modifications!)

Harvey might be an acquired taste for some.  I personally find him motivating and his military style barking somewhat comical but if you don't like feeling as if someone is shouting orders at you, you might not like his personality.  He is very blunt (""I don't mind and you don't matter.""), doesn't sugar coat anything (""Get off your fat wide butt.""), and might even seem a bit insulting (he keeps calling Gian, one of the exercisers, ""Gyland"" throughout the workout, asks him what his name is but keeps calling him by the wrong name--kind of becomes a running joke) but Harvey can be pretty funny and actually says a kind word or two to his background exercisers.

One downside is that some of the camera angles can get pretty crazy but the moves really are soooo easy to follow that it pretty much makes up for it.  (But be advised modifiers:  there is one exercise that is almost complete before you see what the modified version is--but only once.)

INITIATION:  A 2 1/2 minute ""pep talk""/how the workout program works

30 MINUTE WORKOUT:

Warm Up:  March in place to marching combo (march wide-low-forward-up-down-back-up-in), twists and high knees, shadow jabs, cross jabs, and upper cuts, stretches (calf, hamstring, quad, groin, and back stretches; ""kung-fu balance"" and ankle rotations)

First Gear:  Marching
Jumping jacks, scissor jacks, side leaps, ""Beat Those Boots"" (squats but low enough to touch your shoes), side squats, step back lunges, single leg squats

Second Gear:  Light Jogging
Knee pumps, Jab Jab Kick A-- (just regular jab punches)

Third Gear:  Jumping Jacks
Jab Jab Kick A--, Upper-cuts

Third Gear:  Regular Jog/Running
Push-ups (3 down, 1 up count), push-ups (1 down, 3 up count), one-leg burpies, crunches, bicycle crunches, two count leg lifts, jack knives, back extensions (a.k.a ""supermans"")

Cool Down:  Downgrading from running to jogging to marching.  Neck rolls, shoulder rolls, tricep, lat, and chest stretches, seated groin stretch, lying hamstring, lower back, quad stretches, ""preying mantis"" (a.k.a ""cobra""), and child's pose

50 MINUTE WORKOUT (A 20-min continuation of the 30 minute workout, picks up after the back extensions):

Third Gear: Regular Jog/Running
Jumping Jacks, suicide jacks, suicide side leaps (regular side leaps w/ longer strides), jump squats, ""Beat Those Boots"", ""Lunge with a Switch"", One-legged squat with a reach, knee pump with a jab, suicide push-ups (stabilizing on one arm while tapping the opposite shoulder then push-up)

This last four sections don't follow the alternating jog/targeted exercise pattern but go straight from one exercise to the next.  After the last exercise, you go into a third gear jog/run:

1.  Upper-cuts, slow high knees, regular push-ups, body-builder

2.  Double jab kick a-- (front and side jabs), jumping jacks, planks

3.  Crunches, bicycle crunches, two count leg lifts, ""Hello, Dolly"" (crossing legs), plank

2796725,5,B000OIOXOC,"This video was awesome. I started using it and immediately saw results. This guy is right up there on the same level with the people who train the biggest losers or Billie Blanks. I wish I had purchased this video sooner, I would have reached my fitness goals by now. Excellent~!!!!!!",1260835200,,284,4.588235294117647
2796726,5,B000OIOXOC,"I am a fairly in shape guy, and I use this workout as a replacement for the days I cannot get into the gym. I enjoy it, it works good, you feel it afterward.

2796728,5,B000OIOXOC,"This is just right for me. I was barely able to get through it, at first. I've had it for a month, and it's still challenging. I chose this dvd because I get annoyed when workouts are too ""dancey"", and complicated for no reason. It's just a good aerobic workout! Harvey RAWKS!",1230163200,,276,4.326923076923077
2796729,5,B000OIOXOC,"I love this DVD!  He really knows what he's talking about and it's very no-nonsense.  It will whip you into shape in no time - without fancy music, spandex or mirrors.  Highly recommended!",1220227200,2,188,4.636363636363637

8185232,5,B000OIOXOC,I actually have used this before. I bought this to replace my old one. It works. With eating smaller portions and doing the workout 4-5 times a week I lost 60+ pounds. I also kept the weight off!,1395705600,,195,4.157894736842105
8185233,5,B000OIOXOC,"This was such a great find. I enjoyed Celebrity Fit Club back when it was on and was so disappointed when they canceled it. One of my main reasons for watching was to see Harvey because he was fun to see in action and very easy on the eyes. When I came upon this DVD to help me get fit for the New Year, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many great reviews. The price is curiously low so I jumped on it. Everyone is right, it is a great DVD. I enjoyed the 30 minute routine and worked up a sweat. There are no breaks, you keep moving the whole time and Harvey's drill sergeant manner is very effective to me. His comments and quips to his exercise crew was often hilarious. It was all good natured and you can see that he is probably a nice guy in real life.

As for his assistants, they are all very fit, especially Shaela, the track star. She is so fat free that it is amazing. My size 10 curves will probably never whittle down to that but I'll use her as inspiration. There is another young woman who does modifications the whole time which is helpful if you are a true beginner and can't keep up. There are some squats and lunges and a bit of impact with the jogging and jumping jacks but not an excessive amount, for those with knee issues. I can't say I have ever found any exercise DVD's to be fun, and usually grimace when I read that about one, but I have to say this one really is fun!

I was also pleased with the stretching that is done at the end. Taking ballet has shown me how necessary stretching is, and generally, in workout DVD's I find that the instructors spend far too little time on the stretches, and do too few. This one seemed to have just the right amount and I felt the timing was accurate. I may even use the stretching section after I come home from the gym sometimes. It was very useful.

It would be great if Harvey would make another DVD because I would definitely buy it. Thank you Harvey!",1389052800,3,1927,4.147058823529412
8185234,1,B000OIOXOC,"I have given this no stars as it cannot be played in this country. I did not notice that it said ""zone 1"" only so I have wasted my money and have an unhappy husband and daughter who cannot play what I thought would be a lovely surprise for them for Christmas.  Why sell things in Britain that can't be used here!?",1388966400,,313,4.048387096774194
8185235,5,B000OIOXOC,"This is a pretty fun and tough workout. I sweat, I work hard and have a blast. Harvey cracks me up and I need that kind of levity in a workout to keep me interested.",1374278400,,165,3.742857142857143
