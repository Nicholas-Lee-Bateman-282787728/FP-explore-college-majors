188539,5,1572521473,Wonderfully amusing fun. Mr. Cassel and Mr Buscemi are at their best. My whole family loved it.,1162598400,,95,4.647058823529412
188540,4,1572521473,The movie takes more than one viewing to really enjoy. Rather good commentary and extra features; 3 commentaries and interviews. I love the group commentary it's insighful and funny.,1120608000,2,182,5.310344827586207
188541,4,1572521473,"""In the Soup"" is a nice little gem of a movie. If you liked Steve Buscemi in ""Ghost World"" you should like him here because he is basically playing the same perpetually dour and befuddled character. And if you liked ""Ghost World"" in general you should like ""In the Soup"" because they have a similar theme and storyline. They both focus on a character being taught how to live by the example of another character. ""In the Soup"" does not have ""Ghost Story's"" ironic twist (where the teacher is the one who actually learns how to live). It is more straightforward and not as clever but is still light years more intelligent than most mainstream films.

Buscemi's character needs a producer for his 500-page screenplay with quirky features like beginning with a 20 minute black leader (just a blank screen) to introduce his lead character's blindness. He intends to cast his neighbor (and unrequited love interest) Jennifer Beals who barely acknowledges his existence although he sleeps with her shoe under his pillow. Buscemi gets ""in the soup"" when he hooks up with a gangster who wants to produce the film. Seymour Cassell plays the gangster with an infectious gusto that deservedly won Sundance Festival's Best Actor Award. All three performances are excellent, as is a brief appearance by Carol Kane as the co-producer of an access TV show featuring nude interviews (The Naked Truth).

If all this sounds to you like it could be fun you are this film's target audience.

Shooting in black-and-white on a tight budget Director Alexandre Rockwell has put together a funny feature with a lot of charm. The production values are first-class. More importantly he has told a worthwhile story and communicated useful lessons to apply to the process of living.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1116201600,6,1801,4.872549019607843
188542,4,1572521473,"In The Soup is a fine modern indie-styled film.  The story features Steve Buscemi (Aldolpho) as the bedraggled screen-writer, or screen-writer hopeful, who is infatuated with his neighbor, but at the same time willing to do almost anything to get his script published or rent paid.  In fact, I believe it is whatever comes first.

This is Aldolpho's way till interest peaks in his script from an apparently rich man named Joe.  But money sometimes charades with smiles, and Aldolpho is tossed into a more-then Hollywood plot of his own.

I personally find this really quite funny.  At times you kind of question what's happening, and really why, but as long as you run with it you should end up really enjoying the film.  The characters are interesting, and quite match the relativeness of the sleazy apartment complex, but that adds all to the interest.

My favorite portrayal was that of Seymour Cassel's character as the more then eccentric 'fool' that is Joe.  Why at times the craziness of his actions makes you just so curious, while other times he makes the audience purely laugh out loud.

All though you may find the black and white disturbing, this was yet another nice impression to enhance the style of the film; and, as long as you can look past it and the oddity of it all, then please do relish the film.",1113782400,4,1319,4.670995670995671
188543,4,1572521473,"The title to this review is one of my favorite movie lines ever, EVER.  This movie came out right before Steve Buscemi had a part in literally every movie that came out for 2 straight years.  As cool as he is, I must admit I got a little over-Buscemi'd there for a while.  This is one of my favorite roles he's done but the main reason I have always remebered this film is Seymour Cassel.  His role as the fatherly, mysterious and awesomely spontaneous gansgter is pure freakin' genious.  I've yet to see him in a role I didn't like but this has got to be one of his best.  Another classic Seymour Cassel line: ""20 minutes, what are they gonna do, read it in brail?""  You'll just have to see it but trust me, if you even remotely enjoy films by Hal Hartley, Jim Jarmusch and the like, you will love this film.",1088208000,15,809,4.214285714285714
188544,4,1572521473,"With a stellar cast including indie film fave (sorry for the chintzy language!) Steve Buscemi, Seymour Cassell, Stanley Tucci, Will Patton, Carol Kane, and filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, Alexandre Rockwell's In the Soup takes the tried and true tale of a guy wanting to make a film and manages to make this story decidedly fresh and original.
Seymour Cassell's Joe is a consummate con man who knows exactly how to squeeze, steal, and/or cajole money out of a whole plethora of situations.  Joe the slickster with a sexy Asian girlfriend is a perfect match for Steve Buscemi's close-to-broke Adolfo the intellectual bumbler (who dreams of his neighbor Jennifer Beals' Latina Angela), whose 450 page film script--Unconditional Surrender--sends Joe into a rapture of delight at the prospect of financing a real film.  Of course the way Joe raises the dough to make the film is not exactly, shall we say, kosher.
The juxtaposition of naivete, dream, imagination, and petty crime, along with Will Patton's menacing hemophiliac brother and Stanley Tucci's French ex-husband should be seen to be believed.  This is one film that truly deserves to be on DVD.  As of this writing (August 2003), it ain't.  A shame.
A great picker-uppper, a lot of fun, and an all around hoot. Put In the Soup on your shelf.  You won't be sorry.",1061078400,15,1311,4.9363636363636365
188545,5,1572521473,I saw this movie when it came out in theatres when I was ten years old.  Even at that age I really enjoyed it but not as much as I appreciate it now.  I actually got to meet Seymour Cassel the second time I saw it.  He was really great to take his time and talk to the crowd at the theatre.  This was a really smart film.  A movie about making a movie.  I really hope this comes out on DVD.  Some other great Seymour Cassel movies are Rushmore and the new release in theatres The Royal Tenenbaums.,1010620800,2,497,3.95959595959596
188546,5,1572521473,"I accidentally ran into this movie on Bravo.  It greatly potrays the innocence and struggle of a young artist, Adolfo Rollo, who wanted to create something unique-in the realms of Goddard etc. In contrast we find Joe, an old man of experience with a no-nonsense attitude towards life.  Joe jumps into Adolfo's movie project- pretending to be interested in producing it- to exploit the young man's desires and half baked plans to his own benefit.
This is one of those rare jewels one finds by accident: the original  and evocative music sound track by Madden, the original development of the drama, and the obsessions and misinterpretations of innocence add up to movie which is full of spirit and heart.",996192000,7,703,4.890756302521009
188547,5,1572521473,"This is one of the most hilarious, craziest stories I've ever seen. I can't see why people just never heard of it. I am Jim Jarmush fan, but still, I saw this movie without knowing he was the director. It's permanent  fun, great casting, great story, excellent direction. You can't miss it!",961027200,2,290,4.576923076923077
188558,4,1572521473,"just have to archive this, since I cannot find any script or reference on the web whatsoever.

SAM ROCKWELL fans will find him at minute 57 as a mentally challenged teen in a helmet speaking Spanish (I think).  He apparently lives with the Beals character.  True fans will really like this performance, it's a huge departure from all that came before, and shows the range of his acting circa 1992.",1393459200,,397,4.642857142857143
188559,5,1572521473,Jennifer was playing a helpless and neurotic woman--indicating no control of self and life.  She could have played a more important role.,1378857600,,137,5.2272727272727275

188561,3,1572521473,"Unless one argues that it's mocking the 1,001 other ""struggles of the artist"" symbolic nightmares that came before it.  I generally enjoy when black and white photography is used to create a slow mystery, like certain Jim Jarmusch films (who has a cameo here) or like the wonderfully odd ""Saddest Music In The World.""  But here the b&w seems to scream ""hello world this is art with a capital ""A.""  If it was meant to mock that idea as well, then my response is the film should have been funnier.",1364342400,,495,4.477777777777778
188562,5,1572521473,"in the soup is a charming and rather funny look at the life of a would-be filmmaker, who gets in over his head with a likable con man. the cast pull off amazing performances in this quirky comedy that came out at a time in the 90's when  independent films were at their highest peak (before they started being financed by major studios like Fox Searchlight). Fantoma has done a great job with the disc, and I'm happy they didn't include the dreadful color version.",1339804800,,464,4.458823529411765
188563,5,1572521473,"They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but in this case the title and picture on this DVD case give a pretty good indication of what you're going to get: a quirky, black & white indie film, where ultimately you have no idea what it is going to be about but your gut tells you it will be something good. I like to watch movies where you don't know how it's going to play out, which is how I saw this, so I won't put any spoilers here except to tell you that it's about a struggling film artist set in NY and that it has nothing to do with cooking.

The movie has a non-run of the mill plot and includes a very young looking Buscemi who co-stars with Seymour Cassel, who takes Buscemi under his wing (for both good and bad reasons) and ends up stealing the show with a memorable character that you like and hate at the same time. Ultimately, you can't take your eyes off of him. Even if you don't normally like black and white and/or indie films, this is definitely one worth taking a chance on if you are in the mood for a comedy that relies on characters and story over crude humor. You'll find yourself laughing a lot, although there's few typical punch lines or site-gags to be found. The supporting cast is also very good, including many people who pop up that you would not expect to see such as Will Patton, Stanley Tucci, and Carol Kane. If you like this movie, also check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Box-of-Moonlight/dp/1573624055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Box of Moonlight</a>. Sam Rockwell has a small role in Soup, but when you see him in Box of Moonlight you can't help but think he's channeling Cassel's character from here a couple times.

A great film, you'll easily end up loaning this to friends after you get it because no one has ever heard of it.",1333843200,3,1824,4.574923547400612

188567,4,1572521473,"I bought this film after watching Living in Oblivion.  I collect movies about movie making.  This is a great character study, but the story line only uses film making and screen writing as a background.

If you are looking for a story about film making this may disappoint.  (If you want an idea about how to get money for a film, this does go into that in a comic way.)

For Buscemi fans, I recommend his own movie, TREES LOUNGE instead.",1203897600,,438,4.3580246913580245

7797494,3,1572521473,"Has anyone noticed that Jennifer Beals is really beautiful? Yeah like at least a million people.

She is quite beautiful in this film as well. This was early in her career. She plays an angry Hispanic woman, but the accent is pretty slippery. There are good supporting actors here and some interesting character choices which make the film quasi-original. I say ""quasi"" because there is NO way an indie film shot in black and white about an indie film being shot in black and white can be original. As many people have tried to shoot THAT script  as have noticed that Jeniffer Beals is beautiful.",1403913600,,596,4.666666666666667
7797495,5,1572521473,"The punch line is that Joe did everything he did, including dying, to bring Aldolpho to life. He kicks the bag of money away at in the final scene because it never was about the money, but freeing Aldolpho from his angst to be ""In the Soup,"" both in terms of living and making a movie with a real heartbeat. And note that Angelica returns to beach to be with Aldolpho, and that his final lines are about making a movie about their lives, which won't be about their craziness but their humanness. I'm reminded of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. You think it's all about Ferris' antics, but at the end he and his girlfriend focus on Cameron standing up his controlling father at last. And the girlfriend says, ""You had this whole thing planned, didn't you."" Same story.",1398902400,,761,4.482014388489208
