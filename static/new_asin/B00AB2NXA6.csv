8549629,3,B00AB2NXA6,"It's okay  not as good as I hoped for. I collect many ""circus"" films and films with Esther Williams. So I was not sure what to expect. It's Esther's final film, no swimming in it.. It's really about a family member who released from prison, wants revenge. Other side stories deals with a member in love but doesn't not get the okay from the father The circus acts are great to watch., but I was hoping for more. You may like it.

""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

Our story line and plot, When cowboy star Tom Ford (Gene Autry) disappears, Wilson gets his double Gene Autry to impersonate him --- But Ford owes gangster Rico $10,000 and Rico arrives to collect --- He fails to get the money but learns that Autry is an impersonator and now blackmails Wilson and his movie studio ---The likable Gene Autry plays a dual role and has some good opportunities to use his variety of talents in this enjoyable B-Western --- The story is light but entertaining, and it has some good musical numbers plus some comic relief from Smiley Burnette --- The Texas Centennial setting also gives it some additional historical interest.--- But look! When the Sons of the Pioneers do their singing part in the back of the wagon, who is the guy singing, right front? Why, it's Leonard Slye, one of the original members of the Sons of the Pioneers --- This was filmed in 1936 -- Five years later, when Gene Autry left the studio to serve in World War II, the studio needed another singing cowboy and Leonard Slye was chosen --- Of course, the studio had to change his name, so Leonard became Roy Rogers.- - - - - - some Autry fun facts, Gene always preferred his sponsor's product, Wrigley's Doublemint Gum, to smoking.
