8401052,5,B003NF97I0,"Finished watching it last night & was killing me to know who Frank Hamer was & when I saw the name of the actor I was like YES!! I knew I knew him & I didn't recognize him straight off because he was a younger man!! Denver Pyle is the actor & if your old enough & ever watched Grizzly Adams you know him as Old Jack walking around with #7!!! His eyes, voice & mustache give him away!!!",1422230400,,385,3.8860759493670884

8401054,4,B003NF97I0,"I watched the 2013 version of this film on the History Channel, and recalled seeing another version YEARS ago. Amazon had the DVD, so I grabbed it, and thoroughly enjoyed comparing it to the updated one. Sorry...sometimes you really CAN ""make a better mousetrap.""  Both were great, for their times, but the newer one gave a much better insight into the personalities of the two characters. Thumbs up on both!",1389052800,,408,4.828571428571428
8401055,5,B003NF97I0,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" is the correct answer to the trivia question: ""What movie did CBS-TV air opposite the Billie Jean King/Bobby Riggs 'Battle of the Sexes' tennis match?"" (King won, BTW.) ""The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde"" was also a 1967 Top 40 pop hit for Little Georgie Fame (on EPIC records and 8-track tapes!).

Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow lived fast and died young and violently. Their final moments are the stuff of legend, and for anyone doubting the ""hail of lead"" scenario, I can only say that a LONG time ago, I saw the actual car that Parker and Barrow were (in essence) executed. You would not believe the number of holes that machine sustained!

This is one bloody darn picture, and not just at the end. For example, the fate of one Barrow gang member (Clyde's older brother Buck) shouldn't happen to a dog, as the saying goes. Every principal cast member gives here a stand-out performance. The story of a free-wheeling bank robber couple is fast-moving and at times positively gruesome.
