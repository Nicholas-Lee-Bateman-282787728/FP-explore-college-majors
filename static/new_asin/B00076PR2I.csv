I am just saying that when my collection of VHS tapes became old and the analog magnetic media was faltering due to playback, I wanted to get digital of my old movies. But new Disney movies are about $20 even when used.

When Disney movies first came out you could spend up to $100 to get a video that went back in the Disney vault.

Well, same thing is happening with DVD, while we wait for the videos to come out on Blu-ray.

So my solution is to seek out the older videos on the stable LaserDisc format, they are digital and usually disney videos are not subject as much to Laser Rot that damaged discs (there are resources to check if the LD was subject to laser rot)

So I get the classics in digital about 425 lines of resolution as opposed to VHS which is about 220 lines.  Not as good as DVD or Blu-ray but great for watching my favorite Disney Video's again, without spending tons of money.",1344643200,,930,4.2259887005649714
