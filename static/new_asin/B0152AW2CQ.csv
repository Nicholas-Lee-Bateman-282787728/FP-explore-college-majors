7427961,5,B0152AW2CQ,"When Calls the Heart Complete Season 2 is amazing. If you are a Heartie or just love this series you need to buy this 10 DVD Collectors Edition set.
  Im amazed at all of the content in this special set. The five episodes in the movie version, all of the episodes that were shown on the Hallmark channel, a fantastic Special Features Disc. ( will talk more about the special features later), Winter in Hope Valley instrumental CD, and a special short film Journey To Jamaa (True story) produced by Michael Landon Jr. and Brian Bird. That CD Journey To Jamaa should get a review all on its own. Amazing story.
  The extra features DVD has the life stories of Janette Oke and Michael Landon Jr. Which are just remarkable in themselves. Get to know what and who formed their lives. Trailers of course, The stars talk about the Hearties, Get to know the stars of the show and behind the scenes. Every feature is just incredible. I really love getting to know these wonderful people and of yes, so many fantastic pictures.  This 10 DVD edition is well worth the price. What Heartie or just anyone wouldnt love this?  Highly recommended. Wish I could recommend it more.

It is now too late to return this season.  Dad said it was just getting to a really good place and he doesn't want to go on watching the last 2 seasons until he sees what happened.  I would love to be able to purchase just the last 2 discs for him but have not been able to find them. He LOVES this series and I would have given it a 5 if all 10 discs had worked.

7428002,5,B0152AW2CQ,We love this film series and have purchased the first two seasons.  The creator speaks deeply from the heart concerning life's issues and how people respond to them.  It is the progression of love's demands upon the heart and draws the viewer into becoming a part of the story as if these experiences were actually happening to them.  The performances of  the actors/actresses are amazing!,1513036800,,389,4.938461538461539

I actually only wanted Season 2 without the movies (which I already have), but a used set wasn't available at the time I placed this order.  Of course the program itself is wonderful--both in casting and story--as all Hearties know!  I love to have a program to watch that has a quality storyline full of drama and laughter, and is one that I can enjoy watching with any member of my family.
 This show is proof that you can produce a fantastic show without sex and vulgarity.  (There is a place for that type of entertainment, too; it's just not what I care to watch.)  I hope this show continues on past season 4 for many more seasons.",1506556800,3,695,4.3076923076923075

7428190,3,B0152AW2CQ,"I like the story - I loved the books - but I find the movies to be very stilted. The characters are all beautiful and perfectly done up. The sets are beautifully done. But everything is just too perfect. I don't get the feeling of the frontier. I feel like I am watching a play. I am always aware that these are actors on a set. I can't get lost in the story. It's just not realistic....no one ever gets dirty, no hair out of place, lots of make-up and modern dialogues. Did frontier women really dress up in fancy clothes, wear their hair down, and use lots of make-up? Don't think so. Therefore, it feels like a clean, family-friendly soap opera full of beautiful young people. But a realistic frontier drama it is not.",1461974400,3,721,4.348148148148148

7428240,4,B0152AW2CQ,"**Reviewers Note**
While I have yet to purchase this dvd set, I have purchased the entire season 2 on Amazon Instant Video.

Also FishFlix is selling this same 10 disc set for $33.99 (w/ free shipping on $35 orders).  Fishflix Stock No : LM2423222,
According to that page this set does have closed caption, but I'm trying to confirm that with someone that has actually bought it, since last year's 10 disc set didn't have CC or subtitles.

The 5 disc season 2 set through Shout! Factory (sold on Amazon, etc.) is also said to contain closed captions (via SF's official website).
You would have to enable captions via your TV, and make sure your dvd player is set to show captions (on my older HDTV & HD dvd player I have to set it to input #1, and make sure the RCA cables are plugged in).

**UPDATE: Season 3 has been confirmed. There will be a 2 hour ""movie""/double episode Dec. 26, 2015, and 8 more episodes starting in February 2016!**
____________________

Now to some of my thoughts on season 2.....

Producer Brian Bird described this season as a ""roller coaster"" ride, and it appears we got just that!

There was definitely more drama this season than the last. While that isn't necessarily always a bad thing, there's seems to be a delicate balance in keeping the pace moving, while retaining the charm of the previous season.
Personally, I felt at times that there's simply too much going on, and not enough focus on what was important. Also, the storylines were lacking the depth of season 1.
Another thing this season had more of was humor. Last season had a serious/somber undertone, but this season has a lot of light hearted comedic relief (from an unlikely source, no less).

**MINIMAL SPOILERS AHEAD**

To start off... Ep's 1 & 2 (aka ""Trials of the Heart""), gave the residents of Coal Valley the answers, AND decision they've long been waiting for! This impacts the town in a big way, and ushers forth major changes for its future.
We're also introduced to a slew of new characters; many who will be recurring in further episodes this season. In addition, the viewers are taken out of ""Coal Valley"", and introduced to Elizabeth's world in ""Hamilton"".
Although the storyline had a serious undertone, it was equally infused with humor (and cute banter-- especially between Elizabeth & Jack)!

Episodes 4 & 5 (aka ""3. Heart's Desire"" on Amazon) was my favorite, because the latter half of that double episode had a definite season 1 feel. But alas, the subsequent ep's took a step backwards (until the latter half of the season finale).
**I was frankly baffled at Elizabeth's seemingly changed personality throughout this season. Perhaps it's because she lost her center?**

The final 2 episodes (""With All My Heart"") were my second favorite (3'd was ""Trials of the Heart"").
FINALLY, things felt as if they were getting back on track! The focus shifted back to CV/HV, forcing Jack & Elizabeth to face what had become of their relationship during the season. There were palpable moments of emotion, and honesty that we really hadn't seen since season 1. But just as things were drawing to a happy conclusion, BOOM! we're left with a cliffhanger (although one many viewers like myself saw coming).

In conclusion, I felt season 2 only earned 4 stars (instead of the 5 I gave s1). While ""WCtH"" remains one of the cleanest dramas on television; in comparison with the first-- it has a little less ""heart"". Season 1 bore many similarities with another (short lived) favorite of mine-- ""Christy"". In both, the teacher student interaction was at its core. ""WCtH"" season 2 sadly fails to deliver on that end; they're nothing more than an afterthought. And I personally feel Elizabeth's own character suffers for that!

For the 3'd season, I hoping that it will go back to season one's formula: heartwarming moral lessons, positive character growth, and teacher/student interactions. Keep the ""Hamilton"" back and forths to a minimum (if at all), and ""triangles"" in the Bermuda ;)

As for the modern infusion to the costumes, and hairstyles (which has been more noticeable to me, being I watch a lot of period dramas-- especially of the Edwardian era.):
Producer Brian Bird addressed the costumes and hair complaints in the FB group (Fans of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart)
This is just part of his long comment: ""....You should also know that our patron, the Hallmark Channel, asked us to make some of these changes because their research after Season 1 indicated the audience was hoping for more romance, and less grittiness. So, as part of being good partners with our patrons (and wanting to ensure the longevity of the show as opposed to be stubborn and standing on principle) we are doing our best to address some of their hopes and dreams for the series going forward.""",1449964800,6,4796,4.797575757575758
