8455631,4,B0053TGJ4Y,"This documentary film ""Battle of Okinawa - Task Force 58 - American Heritage Series"" is actually the same film titled ""The Fleet That Came To Stay"" from 1945. It is also available on DVD from the National Archive Films or the Amazon Instant Video download from the National Archive edition. The title is a little misleading if you are looking for just film on Task Force 58. I'm not sure which version might be the better quality edition. This version is a decent copy in my opinion but the cost was slightly higher at the time of purchase than the others mentioned here above.",1330041600,,577,4.5576923076923075
