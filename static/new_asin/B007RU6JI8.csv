8521516,1,B007RU6JI8,2 of the DVD's did not have Guiding Light episodes. Very disappointed.,1522022400,,70,4.916666666666667
8521517,5,B007RU6JI8,"I am trying to get as much Guiding Light episodes as possible-and this one is the best!  This DVD offers episodes that were in the GL heyday!  The late 70's were the time of Alan Spaulding (Chris Berneau) and Roger Thorpe (Michael Zazlow) at their most evil and glorious!  A must have for any GL fan.  You must have a PAL or All Regions DVD player to enjoy this treat--it is worth buying one, just to watch this DVD!!  GREAT!!!!",1370304000,9,428,4.3
