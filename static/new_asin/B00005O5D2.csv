7948360,3,B00005O5D2,"I gotta be honest: I never was a fan of Casper Van Dien, particularly during the handful of times that producers tried to shoehorn him into the role of a martial arts hero. In ""The Tracker"" here, he's paired with Russell Wong, which is akin to pairing Owen Wilson with Jackie Chan, with the exception that the comedy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Noon/dp/B00003CXJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Noon</a>&nbsp;is intentional. Nevertheless, this is a surprisingly tolerable TV adventure from 2001, with enough action and character to balance out the flawed writing and, well, Casper. Casual fans may proceed.

The story: A private investigator (Van Dien,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Code/dp/B00004REOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Code</a>) is engaged by a former friend (Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Empire/dp/B00005COWD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Empire</a>) to help him rescue his sister (Lexa Doig,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andromeda/dp/B006P2TA44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andromeda</a>), who has been kidnapped in the middle of a war between underground families.

From the moment that Van Dien's character struts onto the screen and is presented as a master operator and god's gift to women, I knew I wouldn't like the guy, and the film's runtime proved me right. However, he's surrounded by roundly more tolerable costars, chief among them Russell Wong. Francoise Robertson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Minion/dp/B00008L3S7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Minion</a>) is inauspiciously shoved into the film as quasi comic relief, but there's enough depth to her character to make her a welcome addition. Late in the film, Jason Blicker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superstar/dp/B00AEBB9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superstar</a>) joins the cast as a token disabled dude, albeit a moderately fun one. Together, they navigate a screenplay that's occasionally weird (e.g. taxi sexism) but without any surprises...until the very end, when a particularly head-spinning twist made me wish that the rest of the feature had been written with the same level of creativity.

Though there are a couple of big shootouts, the action section's appeal is clearly karate. I was expecting the worst, but got a fairly decent offering of kicks and fisticuffs. Unlike many American features of the time, the choreography doesn't try to ape&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00319ECGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;and is all the better for it, instead going for a slightly grittier level of fight scene. With some exceptions, Casper mainly sticks to punching while Russell owns the show with an encyclopedia of modern kung fu moves. The latter's two fights with henchman Jason Cavalier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Musketeers-Forever/dp/B000063KLB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Musketeers Forever</a>) are particularly cool. Francoise Robertson even gets into the mix of things for a little while, convincingly wielding a baton. These won't be your new favorite fights, but I give them a passing grade.

Director Jeff Schechter showed promise for this kind of feature, so I'm disappointed that he didn't make any other movies. Then again, it's just as well: this is the kind of action film that you happen to come across once in a while and can appreciate so long as it doesn't become your new standard. I loosely recommend this one, albeit you'd be better served to catch this one on television than buying it.",1424131200,,3847,6.860940695296524
7948361,1,B00005O5D2,"This movie achieves nothing that couldn't be accomplished with a television episode a third of the length.
The acting is horrible, probably a result of the cliched and totally unoriginal dialogue.
The fight scenes are ok, but overall mediocre; look somewhere else!",1064016000,4,264,5.309523809523809
7948362,2,B00005O5D2,"Russell Wong and Casper Van Dien are action guys that every now and then luck out with supporting roles in big budget films. Recently those were Romeo Must Die for Wong and Sleepy Hallow for Van Dien. Other than that they are straight to video leading men. The Tracker is the perfect illustration of this fact.

Van Dien plays a womanizing ex-cop turned slick private investigator. Wong is his former friend who recruits him for a major job, his sister (Lexa Doig) has been kidnapped and her husband murdered. But typically, the backstory is Van Dien and the sister were lovers and the brother had a hand in their split, which is why they aren't friends anymore. So they go to New York, hustle up a tough female cab driver (Francoise Robertson) who does not mind getting in harms way for cab fair (because all New York cab drivers care about their customers), and then Van Dien's ex-partner (Jason Blicker) who has no hard feeling towards Van Dien despite some seriously unresolved personal conflicts, to help out. Now that they have there crew there is only one thing to do. Solve the case of which New York mafia family is responsible by breaking everything, and everyone, in sight.
This plot makes for some good comedy. There are some silly twists. Although it is not really suppose to be funny. There are some good fights. Still, this is one of those films where you just know the good guys will never get scratched because no matter how many beatings they take, they just dust off their pants and are fine. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then you might like The Tracker. I would look elsewhere, but I do not regret seeing it. Like I said, there are some good fights, they just weren't quite good enough to save this movie.",1014076800,14,1733,4.55448717948718
