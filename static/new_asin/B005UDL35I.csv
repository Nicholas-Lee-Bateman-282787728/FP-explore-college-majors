8486792,5,B005UDL35I,"I ordered this series's and the Question Words DVD from the same company.  My son really enjoyed these DVDs.  At 3.5 years he was approx 1 year behind in his speech than what would be expected.  We used these DVDs as one tool in our effort to help hi. Along.  He liked this series.  I liked the simple messages and the familiar repetition of each introduced topic.  Loved the kids in the videos.  I found the videos well done and focused on the right topics and lessons.  We definitely heard some of the lessons learned  in the videos in his speech.  At first when we put the DVD on he was uninterested.  We played it once a day usually while I cooked dinner and by the third day he was excited to watch it.  They were in regular rotation or he would ask to watch them for a at least a few months ,  by that time he had advanced beyond the videos. I thought theses were a worthwhile purchase.  It's not a substitute for speech therapy or continued work with your little one, but it's a fun tool that they can watch casually and learn from.  I recommend!",1410998400,,1053,4.221105527638191

8486794,5,B005UDL35I,"I felt I must take the time to write a review because these DVD's have made such a big difference in my child transitioning from single word and two word phrases to sentences.  The concept is that you teach them carrier phrases such as ""I want"", 'I like"", etc. and the child uses these phrases to communicate their needs in sentence form.  I have to say that there is no animation or weird story plots. They just show kids using the phrases in different ways. The quality of production is excellent (not sure why another reviewer commented that it was not) and while it's not a transformers DVD or a cartoon it is engaging and my two year old son lives watching the'big kids'talk and interact. After a week of watching it it once a dy he started using several of the phrases. Then I started prompting him for more and he started using them.  For parents we might hunk this is Irving but for a newly developing talker, a late talker, or even a child with delays these DVD's are amazing and I've seen results from using them in our home.",1341360000,4,1035,4.380208333333333
