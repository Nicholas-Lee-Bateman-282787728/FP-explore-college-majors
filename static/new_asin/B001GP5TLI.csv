3617003,5,B001GP5TLI,This is the first Biggest Loser DVD I've bought and I am not disappointed. I use this after biking and it really pushes me and really stretches me out. This is a great addition to anyone's collection.,1230768000,2,200,4.4324324324324325
3617004,5,B001GP5TLI,"I got this DVD for a change from the average Biggest Loser workout videos.  I was happily surprised at how much I enjoy this video.  I workout everyday and feel the Biggest Loser videos are generally a tough workout.  I was afraid this one might not be as tough.  I was wrong.  It's right up to par with all the previous Biggest Loser videos.  When I did the first workout from the Weight Loss Yoga video, I wasn't sure if it was doing much.  I felt it the next day.  I made sure to do all the other workouts and definitely felt it was working.  It's a great workout!  I am so glad I purchased it to add to my Biggest Loser workout collection.",1230508800,8,643,4.112903225806452
3617005,4,B001GP5TLI,"I was glad to see a Biggest Loser Yoga dvd.  I had to get it!  I did this today along with the Boot Camp DVD and I loved the Yoga DVD the best.  I did the first and second sets and they were pretty good workouts.  You will definitely feel it in your arms!  The only thing I would say is there were a lot of yoga moves that were not included in this workout.  I felt like he had you do the plank a few too many times when there could have been more variety.  With that being said, I think Bob did a good job, and I will rotate this dvd with Yoga by Steve Ross on the Oxygen channel.",1230422400,11,581,3.7131147540983607
3617006,5,B001GP5TLI,"I was excited to hear that The Biggest Loser folks had created a yoga video. It doesn't disappoint either. Just like the previous Biggest Loser DVDs, this is awesome. I have been wanting to get into yoga and this is a great way to start, with one of the trainers we are used to watching each week and with some of the contestants we grow to love on the show (Ali, Bernie, Bill, Michelle, Heba and Vicky).
I definitely recommend this not only for fans of The Biggest Loser, but for anyone who wants a yoga workout that isn't intimidating and is easy to follow.",1230249600,59,559,4.333333333333333

3617008,5,B001GP5TLI,"I've done a LOT of dvd yoga workouts, but this one was by far the best. Bob does a really good job of walking you through each pose. The first time I did it, following his instructions, I was able to do a deep forward bend and hold onto the bottoms of my feet. I've NEVER been able to do this before! I definitely recommend it over any other yoga workouts on the market. (But if you buy it, be prepared to sweat.)",1229731200,24,413,3.9879518072289155
3617009,5,B001GP5TLI,"I ordered this product during the pre-sale so I got it the tuesday that it was released.  I'm new to yoga but I must say that this was one of the best workouts I've ever done.  I read about how yoga has changed so many peoples lives and to be honest, I wasn't buying it.  But, now, I'm starting to believe that maybe there is something to it.  Bob is so motivating (not to mention easy on the eyes)!  The moves are simple and easy to follow, but you can feel your heart racing and your muscles working with every move and stretch.  Of course, I'm presently on Level I, but I'm looking forward to moving up in the next few weeks. Buy it!  Now! :)",1229558400,165,645,4.071428571428571

3617047,5,B001GP5TLI,"I am not one to review items I purchase online but once I did my workout I just had to leave a good note. First of all, I love how encouraging Bob is. I am not a person that does well with being pushed too aggressively and this was a huge plus. Though I am not as flexible and as strong as I could be I am constantly encouraged by the video to keep trying. He is very funny and makes me laugh in the middle of the work out. Over all I recommend this video to anyone that is a beginner to yoga. It is a very positive video from beginning to end and I love the energy he transmits as the workouts progress. There are 5 sections to the video: 1. stretching and warming up
 2. part1 that is light weight yoga
3. part 2 of the workout that incorporates pilates
4. Part 3 of the workout that is very intense
5. Cool Down

There is also a weekly workout you can choose to do as well. Bob is constantly guiding you and giving tips on how to do certain poses. Wonderful experience.",1516752000,4,972,3.9794871794871796

3617049,5,B001GP5TLI,"so i usually use skinny girl yoga the second version which is good but i wanted to do something different that was for weight loss and this dvd is good you get to customize the workout.  This workout is hard but not and I can see myself sticking it out with this dvd and they give you options for different versions of the exercise in case you can't do the version he is doing, and he had people on their in different shapes, sizes and ages, not everybody is small which is refreshing when you're trying to lose weight.  Who wants to keep seeing these skinny minis on there all the time (no offense to the skinny minis it's not your fault that I allowed myself to get to fluffy pillow status).  I would recommend this dvd.  Also, I forgot to mention that although he talks a bit much the transition from one movement to the next flows nicely.

Not only will it help you lose weight and tone your body but it also makes you feel a bit taller because it stretches everything out and helps you get pops out/work out your muscles so I've felt pretty good since I started using this and I mix it in with other workouts as well.

I have actually always HATED yoga.  I've gone to multiple yoga classes & I have always found it boring & never felt that it was actually a workout.

But I am a huge Bob Harper fan, so I figured I would give this one a try.  It is a GREAT WORKOUT!!  My arms, abs and butt were killing me the next day!!  But even more so .... my OBLIQUES were hurting for 3 days afterwards!!

I really liked it and this is the only Yoga workout I have found that I actually enjoy.  You can customize it and choose from:

Warm-up
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Cool down

Since I am new to yoga I chose:
Warm up, level 1, level 2 and the cool down.  I am working up to adding Level 3.  But I am not quite there yet.

I've never watched Biggest Loser but it looked like a good one.  I just started working out about a month and half ago and combined with my fitness level and size, I'm definitely a beginner.  I've only done the level 1 yoga workout. I'm not able to do everything but they give modifications and those work well.  They do have people of all fitness levels/sizes in the warm-up and cool down segments but they go away for the segment I've done.  There's one guy that does modifications but no one is 'large'.  I wholeheartedly recommend you do the warm-up and cool down segments every time.  They're great for easing you into it and I noticed a difference when I didn't do the cool down segment once.  This workout gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat.  My legs are jelly and my arms are sore but you finish feeling like you've accomplished something.  My knees give me trouble sometimes (sore, creaking) but I haven't run into any issues doing this DVD.  Just make sure you are warmed up and listen so you in the right positions. I like Bob, he's encouraging and explains the moves pretty well.  I like this one so much I'm considering getting other Biggest Loser workouts.  Warm-up and cool down are about 5 minutes each.  Level 1 is 20 minutes, level 2 is 15 minutes, and level 3 is 10 minutes (I'm pretty sure).",1480464000,22,1462,4.488636363636363

I take a yoga class once a week through the ""Y"" but sometimes this doesn't seem like enough and I would like to do a little extra between classes.  I liked this DVD mainly because I felt comfortable watching it, and I appreciate how they featured a range of students of varying sizes and differing levels of flexibility. Often I'll get an exercise or workout DVD and feel intimidated by the super-toned, glistening, rock hard bodies but Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga takes a more practical approach, acknowledging that we are all different, that some of us are truly beginners but curious and unafraid to try. This DVD got it right.  Also at the very start of the DVD you can customize your yoga routine so that if you want to spend more time on, say, the workout itself and skip the cool down, that's okay too.

3617181,4,B001GP5TLI,"I am an overweight yoga beginner. I've read several reviews saying that Bob talks too much and doesn't explain the positions well enough yet I'd have to disagree. As with any new instruction as a beginner, whether fitness or a math class, you are looking up to see how the position is formed or the problem is solved on the blackboard. I thought Bob gave good instruction (with his words..which is why there was a lot of talking) and if/when I got stuck, I looked up at the video to watch how it was being done. It was a challenge! I was sweating and swearing and definitely got a good workout, I can't wait to continue. I think this video is great for a beginner who wants to get their butt kicked a little. My only issues are that the quality isn't great (can still see just fine, just not as clear as we've adapted to with our 2016 HD lifestyles ;) and also I purchased this to stream on Amazon and there is no way to navigate through different segments (there's a warm up, 3 different yoga sessions, and then a cool down, giving 5 total segments) so you have to know exactly where each one starts and ends if you want to jump around.",1463875200,4,1137,4.268518518518518

His instructions are clear and not difficult to follow. You can modify and he has two people doing so. Even the level one gives you a good workout. I like that you can set up the option to add first the warm up, your choice of three levels of yoga and then the cool down. The positions he uses are pretty straight forward and he calls them by straight forward names.  This is a pure workout and does not cross over into the spirtuality aspect that some classes and dvds do. I am okay with either but if you have avoided yoga because of that aspect, get this for the body strengthening, stretching and breathing plus a lot of calorie burning. Nice beginners choice as well for yoga.",1439942400,,826,4.329032258064516

The DVD allows you to custom-build your own workout -- there's a warm-up, cooldown, and 3 different workouts of varying lengths so you can customize your workout depending on how much you want to do that day. I haven't done the 3rd workout yet, but #1 is about 20 minutes of pure yoga, and #2 is a 10- or 15-minute yoga/pilates mix focusing more specifically on abs.

3617412,5,B001GP5TLI,"I have been active on and off for the past five years, having been on track and cross country for most of my high school life back in the day. Now pushing 40, its a lot harder to get back into my size 25s. Comfortably in 26's, I was looking for something beyond the breathing and relaxing yoga dvds I had been using. This one is perfect. I realize its a little old, but Bob has always been a likable guy to me so I gave it a try. It breaks it down into three levels. You start with level 1 (about 40 minutes) and then as the weeks progress, you work yourself up to level 3 (which takes all about an hour). I took my time getting used to level 1 and on those days I  just want a quick work out, that's all I do. But on weekends, I do the level 2 and 3. 2 being my favorite overall. It has been over 6 weeks and people have commented on how great I look. You really don't realize how many areas in one you are working out at once. Just remember to try and hold in your stomach as much as you can during this. I kept forgetting! I did find using a mat was helpful at home as the rug was slippery. Items you can buy for this, but not necessary, a small water ball and light dumbbell weights (3-5lb is fine). He mentions using a Boot Camp dvd as a compliment (now I know it is also a strategy to sell more...) but I am going to see what else he sells. I think I am liking his method and the convenience of doing this at home to fit my schedule. I don't like going to classes where its hot and crowded. If you are looking for a simple relaxing yoga (to help you sleep, etc), then I would suggest getting Yoga for Beginners and Beyond by bodywisdom media (dvd). It has low production value, but I really like how she gives you the option of doing morning yoga to wake you up or night yoga to wind down.",1437782400,,1795,3.931318681318681

The DVD format is nice, allowing me to customize my work out conveniently. It would be better if it were a bit more challenging.
Bob's instruction is a bit casual to my style. I don't really care about the random comments he made on trainees. I would prefer he using the time to instruct/remind us to breath, which he does sometimes, or even just to count. His counting sometimes is a bit off too. Like he said 4 more time, counting to 'last time'. I was disengaged after this, but then he has another 'last time' and I had to rush back to  position again. The noise from some students are also distracting. I actually fell from one pose when suddenly hearing Ellie (?) snorted.

I will say that I am overweight and not in great shape, but I still think this is a great Yoga workout.

3617459,3,B001GP5TLI,"This particular DVD has some pros and cons. One of the biggest issues I saw while doing this DVD was that the transitions between poses was not very beginner friendly. Fortunately I have some prior experience with yoga and was able to follow fairly well, but the person that is new to this kind of exercise may find it to be more difficult then they expected. Additionally some of the transitions between poses were not very good. In example, the instructor will have you change positions quickly but the positions maybe very different from one another and I can easily see someone new to yoga becoming frustrated and falling behind. I don't doubt that this video will help one lose weight. But, if you're looking for a good Yoga DVD you might want to pass this one for now.",1434585600,2,774,4.575539568345324

3617489,5,B001GP5TLI,"I had lifted weights for over 35 years. Now, at 56 years old, I don't lift anymore. I started yoga 3 years ago. Prior to yoga, there was no way I ever wanted to try it. In my mind, it was for p***ies. Doing yoga the first time I realized that I was wrong. I decided to go with Ashtanga or power yoga; a lot of push-ups and strength with this yoga. Anyway, I got Bob Harper's ""Yoga for the Warrior"" I really liked it, so I bought this ""the biggest loser: The workout- weight loss"". I've got to admit, when I started this video I almost turned it off. The start of this video shows Bob with overweight people getting ready for this workout. As soon as I saw the students, I immediately thought that this was going to be a workout that is way below me. But feeling lazy , I decided I would go ahead and do the workout. Don't let these students fool you! This is a very tough workout. I loved it. When you are done you will realize that you just completed a great workout!

And at the end of the DVD I didn't want to shoot me tv or push it onto the floor! Normally towards the end I hate the instructor! Lol But Bob gave me a INCREDIBLE full body work out and I only did the 5 Minute Warm up, Level 1 20 Minutes, 5 minute Cool down! And I am SOOO SOAR today! But I embrace that knowing that its working!

3617508,5,B001GP5TLI,"I didn't think it was possible to love a workout, but I seriously love this workout. I have years of experience taking classes, working out at gyms with and without trainers, and for several years I taught ballroom dance. My exercise experience is varied. What I like about this DVD is that you get a good cardio workout without feeling nauseated and like you need to stop. Also, your muscles get a crazy good workout and you hold the poses long enough to really feel your muscles working and start to get shakey, and then move onto the next move without maxing out and needing to give up. The format of the DVD is excellent. You get right to the main menu without a lot of waiting, which can kill workout momentum. The main menu allows to select from a preset workout, or to customize your workout. Choosing a preset workout will take you to a list of weeks: Weeks 1-2. Weeks 3-4 etc. Customizing a workout will let you choose from a warm-up and several levels of increasingly difficult 15-20 minute workouts. The preset workouts are a combination of the warm up and the varying intensity workouts. You can choose to watch the videos with music and voice instruction, or just music. The instructor is energetic without being embarrassing or overly enthusiastic. His team working out behind him is of varying body weights and muscularity, so you don't have to watch a bunch of super fit people ease through moves that you find challenging. Some of his team can only do parts of a move and others are doing the hardest version of the move, so you can see what a pose looks like ideally. The pace of the workout is great; you get a good stretch, appropriate warm up without spending an excess of time warming up, and again- the poses are held long enough to really feel a burn and get shakey but not so difficult that you want to give up. This DVD can truly be used for beginners to advanced workout enthusiasts. Because of the subtlety of the music and the normalcy of the instructor, this DVD seems like it will appeal to men and women as well as those who want a lot of energy and those who want something mellow. All around a fantastic workout.",1429574400,7,2146,4.4770408163265305

I'm overweight by 60-70 lbs, I'm by no means physically fit, and depending on your weight this will be hard on your knees and wrists at times but adding some memory foam bath mats under you yoga mat helps a lot.
After one week doing just the warm up level 1 and cool downs, I didn't lose any weight but the work outs were significantly easier on my body, i ached much less and I felt much better over all.
My job requires me to stand all day and I noticed I had virtually no back pain anymore, and I started sleeping much better at night.

3617571,4,B001GP5TLI,"First things first...this isn't yoga. It's mostly cardio/pilates/weights type stuff. I mean, there are some yoga moves, but it's not yoga. I do like the workout..and I was sore the next day (I like the soreness). I like Bob. But if you are looking for true yoga, this ain't it. And also, he doesn't give any instruction on how to do the poses really anyway, so if you don't know, you are kind of guessing and you might do something wrong and injure yourself. Honestly, while I like the things yoga does for my body, I don't like the philosophy/religion behind it, so Bob is good for that. He doesn't dwell on that aspect of it at all. I like this video, but like I said, if you're looking for true yoga...check something else out.",1425859200,2,730,4.4148148148148145

I wore out my original did and bought this as a replacement. There is warm up stretching at the beginning, and cool down stretching at the end. There are 3 progressive workouts in between, and you can pick what you want to do. The ""maximum results"" program is divided into week 1/2, week 3/4, and week 5/6, which are yoga, then yoga with Pilates, then yoga using hand weights.",1424217600,,499,4.376344086021505

3617647,5,B001GP5TLI,"Hi. I just got this program like a few days ago, I just got done with my second session this week and I have to say its amazing! I really enjoy how the instructor speaks to you during the work outs. When I was in high school I had a coach who said, ""my athletes are only as good as I train them."" Words to live by right; well this video is just like that. You do not have to feel perfect, like he said, ""as long as you are breathing you are perfect."" This is encouraging because I am now about to turn 27, a mother and law student, so to hear those words of encouragement means a lot. I did yoga for like 4 months when I was in college, years ago, and have not done it since, but this video makes you feel good about taking that first step to change. It is challenging but stick with it. Like I said, I just did my second session and I can already feel the difference. I do shake, hence I am no pro, but its worth it. Before you know it the workout is done and you feel pretty darn good about yourself. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to start. Oh and another plus is that you do not have super skinny people in the video. You have both men and women, all sizes and that is encouraging. So if you want to start doing yoga to feel good about yourself or be less stressful (reasons why I began :) ) I say try it. You have nothing to lose, hope this helps.",1423699200,4,1361,3.9347826086956523

I did the warm up, beginner session, then cool down.  I barely made it. I loved the very easy to follow directions. The pace was slow enough that I could compare my form to those on tv, and not everyone was a 5'10 125lb blonde centerfold.  They were REAL looking people! The dvd lets you program your workout by choosing: warmup, beginner session 1, session 2, session 3, and cool down. There were other options as well, I believe for more weight loss.

3617826,4,B001GP5TLI,"I got the streaming version of this DVD so I could easily access it wherever I went. I originally purchased it to switch up my routines with other workout videos. I am a big Jillian Michaels fan and mostly rely on her stuff, especially No More Trouble Zones and the 30 day shred, but wanted to add something extra to the routine. I also have become a big believer in yoga to help with overall conditioning and strengthening. I recently completed a marathon without injury and attribute a steady rotation of yoga and weight exercises to escaping injury-free!

This DVD mixes in yoga and weights - particularly exercises that use your own weight for strength training. There are lots of planks and push ups in this work out, which is what I need (even though I hate them oh-so-much!).

There are a few things that really annoy me with the DVD (especially after you have been through it over and over again). Bob messes up his instructions a few times so you just have to correct yourself or remember the mistake the next time you do the workout. He also will occasionally offer countdowns (like ""4 more seconds"") and then talk for a bit longer before he begins the countdown. If you are like me and are dying in a pose this can lead very quickly to resentment and other not-so-nice thoughts!

All of that aside, you do get a good workout! I don't agree that he emphasizes form enough - I have other DVDs that make sure you are following safer yoga techniques with form and breathing, but just listen to your body and remember to breathe throughout.

Finally, I started this workout before I became pregnant, and it's actually one of the workouts I have been able to continue with. I'm now at 20 weeks of pregnancy and still feel comfortable doing the majority of the workout. I do cut out some of the floor exercises just to be safe, and I take quick breaks if I feel like I'm overworking myself. But the areas worked on this DVD are invaluable for keeping up fitness for pregnancy, and the workout is low impact. I am hopeful to continue this DVD for as long as I can to keep some tone and also support my muscles and posture. So far I have largely avoided a lot of the aches and pains with pregnancy (knock on wood!), and I attribute that to staying active with a blend of strength, flexibility, and cardio.",1413417600,,2307,4.459715639810427
3617827,5,B001GP5TLI,"I've been using this video for about a year on and off. At first, it was difficult for me to do everything. Downward dog, I used a footstool because I couldn't bend all the way over. I couldn't hold the positions too long, if at all. I've been doing the entire video regligiously for about 2.5 months now and have lost 53lbs, in addition to eating healthier. I can now hold all the positions as long as Bob says to. I can hold a push up for 20 seconds, which is pretty good for someone who started out over 400lbs. This video has truly helped me lose weight. I recomend this video if you are really overweight. It is hard when you first start out, but take it from someone who knows, work through it and get past it. It gets easier and you will lose weight. You just have to keep at it!

I have purchased the version to stream and the physical copy, in case I am traveling and I don't have access to stream. When you purchase the CD you can switch up the workout. There is 5 seperate sections so you don't have to do the entire thing. Though I prefer the warmup, 2,1,3 then the cool down. For some reason, it makes more sense to work my body out in this order. If you purchase the CD you will know what I mean.

The people in the video aren't fitness-junkie-hotties, they are just regular people who show that yoga is doable, no matter what your experience, size, or shape. I like the fact that you can customize the workout. Day 1, I started with the warm-up (5 minutes), the level one workout (20 minutes), and the cool-down (5 minutes), and it was exactly as much of a workout as I wanted (and could handle)! 30 minutes a day?

I get a lot of great stretching, breathing, and calorie burning and even though this lacks the ""mindfulness"" component of regular yoga - I still feel a sense of peace and relaxation at the end of the program. I love the instruction - the encouragement to hold poses a little longer, to really focus on my form. I also like that the video has thin as well as heavier people on it which helps boost the confidence a bit if you're not super thin or in shape - anyone can do this program! He gives modifications too if there's a pose that's too difficult/if you aren't yet flexible enough, so that's a big plus! I don't do this program every day - I was doing it about twice a week as I also do other forms of yoga along with it on other days - so, I can't speak to how much weight I've lost or how much more toned anything was specifically from this program alone, but with all my yoga put together I did lose about 10 lbs and had a lot more energy after the first month than without it.

3617990,5,B001GP5TLI,"I have a knee injury that prevents me from doing a lot of exercises such as running or climbing, however I recently took a yoga class and found it helped with the pain. Because of the cost I decided I might try and do it at home, so I decided to purchase this dvd. I've watched a few seasons of the biggest loser and knew that Bob was pretty keen on yoga and I thought it would be a safe purchase as I already know his workout personality from the show.

On the dvd his instructions are quite clear unlike other yoga dvd's I have tried in the past. I was looking for something that wasn't too intense as my goal was to strengthen my leg muscles while avoiding further injury to my leg. However I can happily say this was still challenging. I have done the workout level 1 about 4 times now and have already seen results. My arms have become more toned, my back feels great and my posture is better too. I have been on a clean diet for the past few months but with this dvd my results are making me feel like it's really worth it.

If you are new to yoga, haven't practiced in a while (like me), or are looking for something that will last a while this is a good choice. I think this workout would be great for men who are a little weary of yoga as well as there are 3 or 4 guys doing the workout too. I like how you can customize the workouts so I usually do a warm-up, level one, and cool down, but you can adjust it based on your level and how much time you have.

I think another good thing is that while I found the workout challenging at first, I am definitely getting used to it and think after 2 or 3 more times I will be ready to take on level 2. It isn't like some workout dvd's where I feel it takes me forever to advance to the next level. All in all, this was well worth the $10 I spent and much cheaper than the classes I took that were basically the same thing. I would say the only benefit a class would have over a dvd like this is the instructor personally correcting your form (as long as the class isn't too big!).",1404000000,3,2033,4.002463054187192

3617995,1,B001GP5TLI,"I don't watch the Biggest Loser show but I've enjoyed some of Jillian Michael's DVDs and thought I'd give this one a try. But boy was I disappointed! First of all, Bob talked way too much. I am all for instruction on proper form, but part of yoga is being able to mentally unwind as you focus on your body positions. That's hard to do when he seems to be talking just to talk. Example: at one point he said, ""Yes I know you're legs are burning right now"" then he sniffed the air and said ""Yep, I can even smell the smoke."" Things like that would be better left unsaid in a yoga DVD - just let me focus on the moves! Also, I didn't think his transitions made for a smooth-flowing yoga, and, finally, the music was annoying.

I guess I'll go back to my Denise Austin ""Fat-blasting yoga"" DVD. (Note - that one is not really ""traditional"" yoga but more of a aerobics-based-on-yoga workout) Denise Austin, as peppy as she is, is much more enjoyable to me than this was!",1401926400,6,964,4.26775956284153

But I know that if I did it more often I would be ripped!  I think it is an amazing workout that you get better and better at as you go - but do not hurt yourself in the beginning.  I believe this is a somewhat advanced workout for folks who've done some yoga before or some bootcamp work before and if you haven't don't let me scare you off, just be patient with your abilities in the beginning.  I cannot do a full push-up (no knees) and I don't do all that well with the 1/2 push up and hold for x amount of time either... but this workout makes me want to do better and get better.  It also shows modified versions - so its fine.  And Bob the trainer makes you feel encouraged and fine about doing that.

I am an active person but never exercise but  was motivated to try something new after the Christmas and the winter flab set in. This yoga program begins with a warm up, levels 1,2,3 and cool down component. You can customize the program as it suits your fitness and endurance level. I started with the warm up, Level1 and cool down 3 times weekly for 2 weeks then introduced level 2 into my evening routine. It has now been a month.  I have lost only 3 pounds but my muscle tone has improved and the shape of the body more defined. Especially arms and legs. The instructor - Bob Harper is motivating and the routine interesting. At the beginning I was unable to complete half of level 1 but with consistency and determination you will see progress. Of a special note, I realized this week that any signs of cellulite have almost disappeared. I attribute this entirely to this workout/yoga program. I do highly recommend this  Dvd. I have yet to view the advanced program that maximizes results. Maybe in another month or two!

It is a little tougher, for those of us totally out of shape, than maybe it is advertised to be, but, not so tough that you can;t keep up or continue.  I really like that you can customize your workout.  You can choose your levels and in as little as 30 minutes get a good workout.  I thought the moves did not look hard, but you do need some balance.  It is a good workout and I am still on level one and may be there for awhile (haha).  Anyway, for anyone who has ever thought of trying yoga and would like to tone up and feel better about getting some exercise this is the workout for you.  The price was as so low I thought I could not go wrong and now am really happy that I gave it a try. I wish I had tried yoga years ago instead of trying and failing at other tapes.  I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone, no matter your fitness level, it is not intimidating and the people on this dvd look like real people not models!

Calisthenics this is not. My only complaint is it would be nice to have more of a variety of routines because with 1 major and 2 minor sequences, besides warm up and cool down, the variations are limited and after 8 weeks you get sorta 'bored', but it still works and I'll stay with it.

3618045,5,B001GP5TLI,"I actually bought several Jillian Michaels DVDs about the same time as this one and ended up giving this one to my bff. Fast forward several weeks and she started doing TBL yoga and loved it! I'd fallen off the wagon with my workouts so we decided to start working out together with this DVD and WOW! What a HUGE difference! I liked the JM yoga workout but it was tough and intense and at a quicker pace (which I easily adapted to, but it probably wasn't best since I'd never tried yoga before) but this DVD is PERFECT! Bob is super friendly, encouraging and there's even a tiny bit of meditation at the end which I didn't think I'd like but I've come to look forward to! It's the perfect way to end this workout! I'm only on Weeks 1-2, but I like that even after you finish the six week program there is a maintenance workout so that takes most if not all the guesswork out of the whole exercise bit for me! The moves aren't difficult and he gives you several options if you need to work into it. I espeically liked seeing ""regular"" people (I'm guessing TBL contestants or former contestants?) working out in the video as opposed to well-practiced, toned, super gorgeous people (no offense to them, but when you're starting a weight loss journey, the last thing you need is to see pretty people doing everything pretty perfectly, imo).

I love bob as a trainer; I think he has a great personality.  The reason why I'm giving this a 4 star instead of 5 is because I was expecting more intensity, but the workouts were rather simple for me (and I've never done any yoga prior to this DVD). I know yoga is traditionally known for relaxation, flexibility, and meditation, but with this DVD titled ""weight loss yoga"", I guess I was expecting something more intense.

This DVD is not quite what I expected- Bob doesn't set the right tone or feel for a yoga workout and it misses a lot of the yoga ""flow"" you come to appreciate from taking an in-person class. It allows you to customize your workout by adding or deleting sections prior to starting, but it ends up making for a choppy workout.",1393804800,,413,4.2405063291139244

Admittedly I am by no means a yoga expert but compared to other DVDs I have and have done for years, this one wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. I only do this once a week or so (in addition to current workout routine of Jillian Michaels body revolution) for flexibility but can see how this would bring great toning results too.

But, it's kind of clunky at times.  The results are coming, so can't complain about that.  It's just that the P90X routine had more of a spiritual element to it that Bob's doesn't.  But, Bob's workout is more customizable than P90X, so that's a bonus.  Gives you the option of switching things up.  Decent workout and the price was right.",1393372800,,494,4.674418604651163

3618113,4,B001GP5TLI,"I am a yoga beginner and liked this workout because it was easy to follow and positions are relatively. I am an active person who has used various workout dvds, gone to the gym, and gone jogging regularly for a few years. Although this dvd is demanding I was able to do it. However, I did have a very hard time getting through even the first level the first few times I did it. I cannot stress enough that THIS DVD IS NOT FOR INACTIVE PEOPLE. You need to already be pretty fit in order to even get into some of the positions (like the side plank) and you need to have really good upper body an core strength. I can see how it would be easy to hurt yourself. If you have bad knees, weak wrists, weak ankles, or weak shoulders you could be injured by this workout.

That being said, this workout will do what it promises if you can keep up. I myself have not gotten beyond level one because I prefer jogging over this dvd but I can tell that it burns calories and strengthens muscles unlike many other workout dvds that promise the same.

The first time I could barely do the warm up and workout 1.  I am slowly building up, though.  Also, having normal looking people in the video was seriously the best thing.  Who really wants to see a bunch of ripped people who can obviously do the exercises?  This is definitely one of my favorite purchases.",1391212800,,480,4.337078651685394

In several place he clearly says the wrong direction, such as saying to drop your hands to the side when in fact he wants you to keep your hands held up. The video producers could have easily fixed the audio track and I'm quite disappointed that they didn't. The workout is still good quality, but I find it annoying when I have to reset my pose because the instructions were wrong...it distracts from your focus on the exercise itself.",1391040000,,602,4.532110091743119

I live in an upstairs apartment and wanted something that I wouldn't make to much noise with but that I would still get a god work out with. I plan to use this dvd 4 times a week and then work out at the gym over the weekend. I think that those two things are good compliments to each other. I was not able to make it through the whole work out and it says that this work out should be for the first 2 weeks. This first week I am going to focus on getting the moves down and actually trying to make it through the whole work out without stopping, THEN I will start my 2 weeks. This is a great intro to yoga. Bob is amazing at explaining each pose and he is great motivator. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD! Also let it be known that on the dvd itself it says that a medicine ball is recommended. The first 1-2 week work out does NOT use a medicine ball but I am sure that later in the dvd one will be needed.",1386720000,,990,3.857843137254902

It's not difficult to keep up and modify according to your ability so don't be discouraged or worried about that. They move fast but not too fast that you can't keep up.

3618191,5,B001GP5TLI,"I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis last month and needed to find some sort of aerobic exercise I could still do until the swelling in my left foot went down. I decided to see if there was any sort of intense yoga option, since yoga involves gentle movements (no pounding pressure on my sore foot). I am thrilled I took a chance on this one!

I have no idea which stretch is doing this, but something on this DVD is wonderful. The evening after doing this DVD the first time, I had pain relief ... my heel wasn't painful! I figured it was a fluky deal, but sure enough, it worked a second time. Took my son on a field trip with lots of walking and irritated the PF again. Did this DVD (just up to level one, since I'm new to this) and again the pain went away. Again, I wish I knew exactly which pose is helping my foot, but for now I'm just going to continue with the DVD.

From an exercise standpoint, your heart rate does go up and you do sweat to this one. There are a lot of push-ups, which are challenging for me. My clothes are fitting better and I am starting to feel toned again.

I really like that you can select which sessions you want to do at the beginning (I've been doing warm up, level one and cool down) and not have to grab the remote and select them as you move along. Just select what you want, set it and go, and it runs through all that you've selected.",1381104000,4,1379,4.1

I was able to finish the second time through, and my legs were shaking by the end of the workout (which is good).

His instructions are pretty clear, although if you've never done yoga before, it'll take some time before you're able to complete the movements correctly.  There are three workouts, building on each other over time.  Let me tell you - it's intense.  But I love it.  I even got my husband doing this workout!

Then you can choose to add 15 minutes of ab work via yoga stretches and positions of course. Then you can add 10 minutes of more advanced yoga moves.

This dvd is nothing like that.

Let me just first say that I've never really watched the show. This dvd has REAL people doing the moves and there's always one or two of them doing alternate moves if you're not quite there yet. I love that Bob breaks down the moves and really shows you how to do them, not like others that just expect you to know how to do it. That has always seriously annoyed and discouraged me.

3618286,4,B001GP5TLI,I bought this along with the BL Bootcamp DVD and it is just as challenging! I feel stronger and more flexible but it is definitely a workout! The only reason I gave 4 stars is that it is necessary to look at the screen during some of the inversion poses which can get kind of annoying.,1373932800,,285,4.107142857142857

Just have to be consistent EVERY SINGLE DAY!  You can do this!  Challenging, but fun.  Uses a range of weights and I sweat like crazy when I am done!  It's nice to have a different workout every three days.  My body never gets used to ONE workout.  Day 7 I like to rest!",1373673600,,441,4.046511627906977

3618311,5,B001GP5TLI,"I ordered this DVD not knowing if it would work for me or not. It has and does. I am very overweight, though I've lost 50 lbs, I still have a ways to go. I started this DVD not having any sort of exercise experience (hence the being overweight part). I have since started going to a gym, but alot of people who have a weight issue, are nervous or possibly embarrassed to enter any sort of public gym or classes. This was me. It starts off slowly,meaning stretching, but builds up quickly. Some of the moves I couldn't do for a long while. Don't beat yourself up. The fact that you're trying is awesome! You will get there soon enough. I was sore for the first few times afterwards. Soak in a hot bath with epsom salts and apply peppermint oil in some sort of carrier oil(olive oil, almond oil, etc)on your sore spots and you'll slowly get used to it. I like Bob Harper's enthusiasm. He's clear in speech and helpful. He's not annoying like most exercise hosts can be. Don't get me wrong, I hated his face at the end of each session, but he pushes you without you wanting to shoot out the TV just to stop seeing his face. I had no idea what I was doing at first, gave up, walked back into the room and kept going. If I can do it, you can as well. Good luck and I hope this helped someone.",1370131200,677,1287,4.131474103585657
3618312,5,B001GP5TLI,"I'm a yoga instructor and even I find this DVD to be extremely challenging and an excellent workout. Bob leads a series of progressively more difficult levels that you can choose to do individually or in series. He incorporates a lot more athletic poses and some elements of pilates to get you (seriously) sweating and working hard. He offers plenty of options both for beginners and for the more advanced, so no matter where you are physically this workout is accesible and will get you results. My only complaint is that some of the participants have horrible form that Bob doesn't bother to correct. You're pretty safe watching Alley for technique, but even she is out of alignment a few times.

What I really love and respect about this DVD (and all of the Biggest Loser videos in general) is that it's a bunch of real people, not the 6'10"" willowy rubber bands you typically find on yoga DVD's. It makes you feel like a normal person seeing the rest of the group grunting and sweating and readjusting and working hard instead of the workout seeming effortless.

There's a great quote in this DVD where Bob says something along the lines of ""Some people are like 'Ohhhh, yoga. I don't get a good workout doing yoga.' Well then they've never tried this, this is weightloss yoga."" I laugh every time he says it (despite having heard it a thousand times) because it's so true. Don't write off this workout as not being challenging enough because it's ""just yoga."" It will kick your butt and leave you sore. Give it a try! I highly recommend it.",1369353600,6,1545,4.614545454545454

3618345,1,B001GP5TLI,"347 reviews and most all of them positive... why not try this DVD?  Needless to say, I made it through the first 30 minutes and had to stop.  Bob does not stop talking.  He talks so much, in fact, that I forgot to focus on my breathing and the postures, which are fundamental in yoga.  Also, his instruction is terrible.  ""Put your foot up to the sky.""  ""Sit down like you're getting into a chair.""  Nothing about grounding, lengthening, where to focus... it's more of a land-in-the-pose style of yoga.  His transitions aren't very good either.  My favorite was hearing this while in triangle pose: ""Come down to your chest.""  What?  How?? From here???  The resolve was apparently an airplane-style transition, but it could have been explained much better.

I prefer to do yoga with instruction from someone who has experience teaching yoga; this celebrity TV fitness trainer is really lacking in that department.  However, if you're looking for weight-training, cardio, and abs with your yoga; if you enjoy a highly motivated, very talkative instructor; if your focus is not on the posture, breath, or clarity that comes from yoga; then this is for you.",1366934400,32,1154,4.851282051282051

3618372,5,B001GP5TLI,I love Yoga but needed a little extra challenge. This DVD is not hard but is very challenging and will have you sweating in no time. Bob Harper does get kind of annoying sometimes and the music in the background is not soothing at all. I like to listen to more relaxing yoga/meditation music on Pandora Radio and turn this down to nearly mute.

That said, the workout emphasizes upper body and core strength, holds poses for quite a while, and really gives a tough workout.  Level 1 is yoga, Level 2 is a combined yoga/pilates with a weighted ball, and Level 3 is yoga with added free weights.

I don't have a lot of upper body strength or core strength, so I've found this to be very difficult.  I don't know why I've had so many problems with injuries doing this workout but if you're not real strong, proceed with caution in this workout.",1362700800,,793,4.211920529801325

Not hard as in you can't do it if you aren't a seasoned yogi, but hard like whatever level you can do it on gives you a great workout. I've been doing this program in my rotation for about 2 months now and I'm still sore every time I do it. Bob gives you at least 3 different ways of doing most poses, so you can do this program no matter what fitness level you're on. I also love that the people doing the workouts along with Bob aren't perfect fitness models; they're real people with real problem areas and weight struggles. I don't watch the biggest loser, but the workout stands alone due to its quality and ability to make you stronger every time you use it.

My orthopedist had told me I could not continue my regular aerobic workouts so I am looking for an alternative workout routine.  A friend suggested yoga but as I have never done it before I was hesitant to head straight to a studio.  I have been doing this DVD regularly for about a week and have found it helpful and can tell a difference with my knee.  The pace and routines are designed for those new to yoga and Bob gives good instruction and reminders as to form along the way.  There are also good ab and cardio sections - although both are pretty brief (10-15 minutes each).  I do think one issue (as with all workout DVDs) is that it is difficult to know if you are doing all the poses completely correct, so expect to do some stopping and looking at the screen to check out the form of those onscreen.  Once I am familiar with these basic poses I plan on taking some studio classes where you get more one-on-one.  So, if you are looking for a heavy-duty workout or are mildly experienced with yoga I don't think this video is for you, but if you are looking for a way to begin to develop your strength with something you can do quickly at home I would recommend this.",1360886400,,1268,4.298319327731092

I've been doing yoga for a few years and wanted an at home workout for those days when I can't get to the studio and this is a great one. Challenging and fun you can make the workout as long or as short as you want which is great.  I haven't lost any weight yet, but I definitely know my body is changing.

It's like a formula. It's sooooo hard the first couple weeks but if you can stick with it, you really do see results (I've lost those 5 pounds!).

Even doing the warm-up and cool-down with Level 1 only works up a bit of a sweat and it becomes an even better workout as you add the other levels.

I liked that this DVD allows you to create a custom workout. I have only done this DVD a couple times so far but this option will keep me from getting bored. I can do Level 1 with Level 2 or Level 1 with Level 3 without having to keep pressing buttons on my DVD player. I choose which levels I want when I pop in the DVD then am good to go for the duration of my workout.

I do a lot of other exercises including advanced levels of Jillian Michaels DVDs and running but I still felt like I got a workout from this DVD. Bob Harper is great at explaining the moves you need to do and there is a beginner that you can watch if some of the moves feel to challenging for you. I cannot comment on how this DVD would work on its own for weight loss since I do it alongside so many other exercises.

It is great to incorporate into your fitness routine...I run about 10 miles a week in addition to this video (now cut back to twice a week) and I couldn't feel better! Bob Harper is truly incredible. If you like this, read his ""Skinny Rules"" book...his 20 simple rules have increased my metabolism like crazy!",1339545600,8,730,4.111888111888112
3618488,5,B001GP5TLI,"I have tried alot of workout videos and none of them have ever been able to get me past the fact that I just hate working out. I hate it. I hate doing it, and being sore the next day makes me wish I never had. But it's only the first day with this video but I think I may have finally found a program that I can succeed with. I feel tired and energized at the same time, and that wonderful looseness that comes after yoga makes me think I probably won't be regretting this tomorrow.

This is a routine a beginner like me can handle, but I doubt even seasoned fitness fanatics would be able to say it's not a real workout. Bob is so much less annoying than the ultra-perky workout divas I'm used to, and the fact that he has people of all different levels of fitness doing the exercises with him makes me feel so much better. At least I know I'm not the only one shaking like a leaf trying to hold some of these positions. He provides great options for weaklings like me to build up their strength, and advanced alterations for the more hard-core buyers. I've checked out the different stages of the workout and they all seem logical and challenging without being too intimidating. It's definitely a routine I can grow into.

One further thing I like about this video is that it doesn't send me into an asthma attack like most cardio based weight loss routines do. I could push through the difficult, strength-testing parts more easily because I wasn't also struggling to breath. I was sweating, my muscles were burning, but my lungs were working just fine!

I do not find that DVD's present a challenge, or do not hold my attention (there seems to be the same breathy female narrators voice-over on all of them).  This one however kicked my butt. I run about 20 miles a week and do weight training 2-3X a week and felt like this is a great workout if I can't get my run in or for a change in the mix.  I like the weekly plan. There is more focus on strength (which is what you might find similar to a Flow class) then flexibility. This is not a meditation DVD but I expect that if you are interested in this then you know that.  For the price you cannot get a better workout.

I also like how it is interactive and you can build your work out as you go along. I am still just at level one but I can't wait to advance. What's nice is the people in the video are from previous episodes of biggest loser so it feels like everyone, you and them, are working together to burn. To me, it's more inspiring that way versus looking at fit ripped people doing a workout that seems like a breeze to them.

I  haven't worked out in five years, had never done yoga but have always been flexible and thought it would be fun.  IT ITS!  I don't watch the biggest loser, but have certainly heard of Bob Harper.  He has become like my best friend.  He motivates and knows what to say to keep you going.  All three sessions are excellent and I've now started doing weight training and it all began with the third session on this DVD.  Ive also become an addict to Bob Harper DVDs.  This particular DVD, along with complete change of eating habits, has helped me drop 14.8 lbs in 8 weeks.  BUY this if you want something relatively basic, but definitely a work out, to start out with.  It's great to have the warm up, level 1, level 2, level 3 and the cooldown individually so that you put together what you want to do.

Position modifications are shown for most moves.  I liked the 6-week progression.  I'm in maintenance mode with this now and am still working on perfecting some of the moves.  However, I like that I am able to notice improvement.  I have the worst sense of balance and was only able to hold the Crescent pose when I got into maintenance.  There is a lot of plank but do what you can and you will slowly start to notice that you can do more and more of those positions - if you have to be on your knees then be on your knees and keep trying!

Also Jillian has pros in her video which really helps when posing, they are better to watch than the biggest loser contestants.

There are a few places where he gets confusing because he tells you something by mistake and corrects himself or he's talking to his cast mamber.

And nothing is worse than making that decision to get a workout dvd only to see perfectly fit, perky little 20-something's jumping around telling you that it's 'easy' to lose the weight, just put your mind in it.  Truthfully about 2mins in I feel like I'd rather put my shoe through the tv and go grab those Lindor truffles and curl up with a good book, while feeling the 'burn' of that delightful smooth chocolate filling my tummy.

Well, never fear...BOB IS HERE, to end the madness and help the 'rest' of us.  (Collectively known as the 'real' people of the world!)  And get this...he's got other 'real' people with him on the dvd, making you feel perfectly normal while trying to hold a triangle pose while balancing your soon to be tiny belly.  This is a GREAT dvd for starters, intermediate and advanced yoga enthusiasts!  Great pace, great encouragement and fantastic poses that focus on your inner and outer well being.  Bob pushes in the right places and leaves you to your own when you need it.  You even have the option of doing the workouts without hearing his instruction and just hearing the calming music while you go though the workouts.  This workout leaves you feeling empowered and energized, without feeling like you have missed something because you couldn't 'keep up' with the cast on the screen.  In no time at all you'll find yourself loving the art of yoga, and adoring the new 'real you' in the mirror!  Definitely a great buy!!!",1327276800,10,1569,4.686131386861314

I absolutely LOVE the cooldown at the end of the workouts. It actually keeps me going through the 20 min workout (week 1 ) just to get to the cooldown. It leaves me so relaxed and mellow.

You have to remeber this is Yoga for Weight Loss. Before I purchased this, it made me assume that poses would be different and a little more difficult/strenuous. It didn't let me down.

This is perfect for beginners looking to lose weight. For people who have more experience in yoga and looking to maintain, I wouldn't suggest this video. It is slow, and a lot of talking, but it's perfect for someone like me who has no idea what they're doing.",1326153600,4,907,4.261627906976744

Warm Up- 5 min.
Yoga Level 1- 20 min.
Yoga Level 2- 15 min.
Yoga Level 3- 10 min.
Cool-down- 5 min.

You select what you want to do from a menu and then proceed. I did the warm-up, level 1 and cool-down. It was extremely difficult (I have done quite a bit of yoga but I'm currently not in great shape), but difficult in a good way. I felt as if Bob, the instructor, was really pushing me, but also giving me options to modify if needed.

I liked that there were people of all different sizes and levels working-out. It made me feel like I was in an actual class.

It was traditional yoga, but my heart-rate was up and I felt I got a good work-out. You also have the option to turn off Bob so that you are just working out visually and with music in the background. The great thing is, unlike other DVDs, I didn't find this cheesy or annoying at all.

You can do workout 1 twice in a row, then workout 3. Mix and match however you choose.

My core was sore the next day. I considered myself quite active (working out about 5 days a week)at 5'6"" 118 lbs. I do have some familarity with yoga (taken a few classes), but am not a huge follower. So, from my perspective-some familiarity and pretty fit, this is a great, core-working, lower-key workout.

3618520,5,B001GP5TLI,"If you are looking for a workout that is challenging, fun, and not the typical instructor screaming at you while doing a million squats and lunges, then this is for you.  As you may be able to deduce, I am the kind of person who really dislikes traditional workout programs like aerobics and boring weight-training routines.  Therefore, I've done the 10 Minute Solutions Pilates video series for my strength training needs for a very long time (highly recommend those as well), but have gotten a bit bored with them and was looking for something new.

This video was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a slender person in my early 30s who, while admittedly have been fairly inactive for the past few months, is in decent shape.  But even for someone like me, the Yoga Level 1 routine had me shaking within minutes.  My butt and thighs were on fire!  IMO, holding yoga poses is so much more effective (and low-impact) than squats and lunges.  I could really feel deep into the fiber of my muscles while doing warrior I & II, whereas with squats and lunges, I just feel it more in my knees.  Bob is a great fitness instructor and is motivational without being annoying or cheesy.  He also keeps the workout moving - giving you no time to rest - which is the key to an effective weight-loss workout.  I wasn't sure I could go on to Level 2 since I was shaking so much from Level 1, but tried it anyway.  It is a combination of pilates & yoga ab work, which I have been doing for years, so it was all familiar to me - yet still challenging, and I could definitely feel it my core.  I am sure that if used 3-4 times a week, this video will be a very effective way to firm up in no time.

One last word to the reviews where people say this is not yoga.  Yes, it is.  In Level 1, he's using all traditional yoga poses.  What about this is not yoga?  Yes, Levels 2 & 3 are more focused on a hybrid of pilates & weight lifting, but so what?  The title of this video is ""Weight Loss Yoga"", not ""Classical Yoga"".  The title itself is obviously implies a different take on it, as does the fact it is featuring a trainer from the Biggest Loser.  It's helping people lose weight and firm up by using some basic fundamental poses of yoga.  If you want something that is straight, classic yoga, buy a DVD that actually proffers that.

Bob's a sweetheart and is super encouraging. I find myself smiling at some of his jokes, even the umpteenth time I've heard them and my arms or legs are shaking, though he does talk a little too much.  The DVD is more focused on fitness than most yoga DVDs, and does not focus on breath enough, but that's understandable for a Biggest Loser workout. Bob's not the best at explaining form and the contestants who model often have incorrect form, so those who are new to yoga might want to start with some Rodney Yee or Linda Arkin or read a books that describe the poses in more depth before jumping into this DVD. There are a few places where the editing makes the timing uneven from side to side, but for such a great workout, I'll forgive this.",1312588800,,901,4.363095238095238
3618524,5,B001GP5TLI,"I had never seen The Biggest Loser, and would probably never watch it, so I really didn't know what to expect going into this video.  I just grabbed it because it was in the $5 DVD bin at the grocery store and I was thinking to myself, I should really get back into yoga.  And then I forgot I had it for a long time.  But then I REMEMBERED!

I really cannot say enough good things about this DVD.  It is an excellent workout, has a great likeable instructor, shows a variety of REAL people doing the routines, features non-obnoxious music, and has a very useful interactive menu that allows you to customize your own workouts after completing the initial program.

Though it is presented as a six week program, it can be used for far longer.  It recommends that you do one level for two weeks, and then introduce the next level, until you are doing all three levels (and the warmup and cool down) for a full 1 hour workout.  This is an excellent system for getting back in shape if you have been inactive for an extensive period of time, and it works very well even if you have to go at a slower pace.  I did each level for at least three weeks (6-7 days a week) before moving on to the next.  And if you are eating right and really sticking to doing the routine every day, you will see and feel immediate results.  I lost an amazing amount of weight using just this DVD, and I enjoy it more than any other workout routine I've done in the past.

Bob is a really helpful and likeable instructor.  He is so cute and smiley.  It makes the workout that much more pleasant.  And the other people in the video, who I understand are previous BL contestants, are all at different fitness levels (instead of being a bunch of perfect looking, tiny women) and sometimes struggle with parts of the workout just like you will, and make you feel like it's okay if you can't do all of the poses immediately.  This is a major point in favor of this DVD.

While the Customize Workout menu is an excellent feature, the only real complaint I have about this DVD is about this menu.  It allows you to add any of the five routines (Warmup, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Cool Down) to your workout in any order you want to do them in, but you can only add a max of five.  So if, for example, you want to lengthen your workout and add extra strength training by doing Level 3 at the beginning and the end of your workout, the Cool Down will get left off the end, etc.  It's not a major hassle to have to go back to the custom menu after the fact to do the Cool Down in such situations, but I think it would be really advantageous to remove the 5 routine max from that feature.

All in all, it's a 5 star product.  And I'm just about to order myself another one of the BL DVDs so I can see if I like to watch Bob doing other stuff too.",1312243200,23,2809,4.143911439114391

3618532,5,B001GP5TLI,"I suffered the worst back injury of my life in early 2003.  I saw all sorts of doctors, chiropractors, massage therapists, physical therapists, etc.  I ""hurt it"" (at least accutely) reaching down and across my body playing tennis, but even with all sorts of tests, exams, etc. - it is difficult to know what ""caused"" it - whether it was that action, years of wear, etc.  I had only had one back incident in years of playing football, powerlifting, and all sorts of other sports.  It was almost intollerable pain for many months, nagging problems for at least a year, with flare ups for 2-3 years.  In those early months especially, it affected my work, my sleep, my health, my relationships - every part of my life.  I even considered back surgery at one point.  Below is a rough outline of the major steps in my path back to health.  I have shared them with my friends and others who ask, and hopefully they might help some others out there (I plan to post it under a couple of the products listed below).  I especially encourage anyone to try some of these things before surgery, extended narcotic use, or more extreme treatments:

1.  A conservative neurologist and a conservative physical therapist encouraged an intense stretching routine.  I am not talking about a few stretches, with half effort, when you feel like it.  I am talking about several times a days, stretching intesely, attacking the problem, and giving your body a chance to begin to heal itself.

2.  The ""Core Secrets"" program by Gunnar Peterson was a God-send and the first major step.  It was focused on stretching and strengthening, but was difficult enough to push my body some and begin to get back in overall shape.  I challenge anyone with back problems to try it for at least a few weeks or months and see if it does not help greatly (but not instantly!).

3.  Swimming mixed with frequent hot tub therapy to get to the next level of fitness.

4.  The book ""Back Sense"" by Siegel, Udrang, and Johnson was helpfull, especially on this main point: the best thing for the vast majority of back problems is not taking it easy or addressing some structural defect, but getting back to normal movement.  I am not a doctor or back expert, and I cannot vouch for every idea and part of the book, but this was certainly an encouraging book for me in my particular situation and might be for you too.

5.  Pilates at first but then yoga, especially ""The Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga"" with Bob Harper, helped get me to the final stage of flexibility and strength where I felt comfortable getting back to more demanding activities such as tennis and jogging.  A few years ago, if someone would have told me about yoga, I would have thought they were crazy and likely would not have listened.  But I cannot tell you how much this product has helped me - especially in managing and preventing back pain.",1303516800,,2872,4.58235294117647

I jumped in to working out after just a few weeks, but didn't want to go too hard core with cardio until my body was ready. This was a still an intense workout, but I was able to keep my heart rate on the lower side. Once I started feeling back to normal again, I added in the Cardio Max dvd and was down to my pre-pregnancy weight before my daughter was 6 months old. I now am running every other day, and on my off days using this as a strength workout. After a year and a half I still love it!",1303257600,6,612,3.904

I always break a sweat, feel the heart rate rise and feel like I got a thorough workout.

I find that I personally like the biggest loser dvds where bob is the instructor - compared to the ones where jillian is. Her dvds give results too but she isn't as good of a motivator, i find her overly pushy and negative. And so i lose interest fast. But dvds with Bob such as this one,i love.

I've wasted a lot money on workout videos that ended up being huge disappointments). I don't watch the Biggest Loser very often, but I have seen a few episodes, so I was somewhat familiar with Bob. This DVD is very good and I was surprised at how challenging it was. I am not a fitness fanatic, but I do work out on the treadmill regularly, and I also do some strength training in between. I tried one of Jillian's videos (again, checked it out from the library--they mailed it to me for free!) and I absolutely hated it. I found her to be crass and, frankly, her behavior was just weird--like she was stoned or something. Anyway, I found Bob to be nothing like that! He was pleasant, clear in his instructions, and supportive without being sappy, bullying or obnoxious. I worked up quite a sweat, and my core was sore the next day. I couldn't believe that the other people in the video could hold those poses for so long-- longer than I could, and I viewed myself as being in better shape than most of them (that'll show me!). In fact, I found their ability to out-perform me to be inspirational as well as humbling. It was also a good reminder that fitness goes beyond cardio and weights. I highly recommend this one. And based on the reviews of Bob's Boot Camp dvd, I'm planning on checking that one out from my library next! If I like it, I'll be back to buy it.",1293408000,10,1487,4.314285714285714
3618551,5,B001GP5TLI,"This is the yoga workout I've been searching for. I'm a curvy chick and some of the traditional bendy moves in yoga are hard for my to do. In this video, however, I don't have to be frustrated because the moves are simple (position wise) but definitely not easy (endurance wise). You definitely will feel the burn, I promise. After doing this video for a couple of weeks I already notice how much more flexible I am and I can hold the poses longer and longer than I could when I started. There is a customizable menue that allows you to add elements to your work out: warm up, yoga 1, yoga 2, yoga 3, and cool down. This is great because as you build your endurance you can add on, or just do one of the workouts plus warm up and cool down. Bob is fun. He is encouraging but he doesn't go easy on you either. All you really need is a yoga mat. In yoga 2 some of the participants are using water balls, but some aren't and Bob says you don't absolutely need one. In yoga 3 they lift light weights, but if you don't have those a bottled water or something similar would do fine. I rented this video from my local library and I have decided to buy it because I actually enjoy it (despite the burn) and I find it relaxing and motivating. I feel powerful as I do it and as I improve. I don't want to have to fight with other people to be able to rent it on a regular basis. I highly recommend this for anyone, especially those who want to lose weight, because it's working. You definitly do not have to have yoga experience because I had very little and am still able to manage. If you find it's hard for you, stick with it and pause it if you need breaks.

The length is perfect for a full yoga workout.  Level 1 of the workout is amazing (holding power poses) and takes you back to the basics with warrior 1/2, extended side angle, triangle, reverse triangle, chair.  And of course, no Bob workout is complete without some planks in Level 2 which focuses only on core work.  Level 3 combines yoga with hand weights which I found to be really unique.  I had never done that before.  You even get to do corpse pose and meditate at the end, which is lacking in Jillian's Yoga Meltdown.  I also found Bob really entertaining in this DVD, as opposed to his Pure Burn Super Strength DVD where I wanted to punch him in the face.

3618568,5,B001GP5TLI,"""The Biggest Loser: Weight Loss Yoga"" is perhaps the most strenuous yoga workout I've ever tried. Each position is held for enough time that you really feel your patience and your endurance being tested. You will recognize postures like warrior I and warrior II, plank, downward dog and others. They may look easy at first but your arms will start to tire and your legs will begin to shake. At least if you are at an intermediate level. Because of the time you hold the poses I think this workout is more advanced. If you do the entire workout you will warmup then do 45 minutes of yoga (three sections) and then cool down with some relaxing stretches that are easy to do. The only things you need for this workout are a yoga mat, 3-5 pound weights and a six-pound medicine ball. If you are a beginner you could skip using the ball and weights. Modifications are given for most of the difficult exercises and some of the exercisers demonstrate the easier versions for the entire time. Bob Harper is an excellent trainer and I felt like I was getting individual attention. His cuing is so precise it is a pleasure to exercise with confidence. I'd recommend this workout to you if you are intermediate to advanced, have been doing yoga for a few years and want to take things up a notch. Expect to take a nice warm shower after this workout, you are going to sweat!

I only did the first workout, so I can't comment whether they get any better.

Bob is obnoxious as a yoga instructor. This isn't an aerobic workout, I could do without all the pumping up...""Your arms will look just like this!"",""You are going to be burning fat!"" He talks too much and doesn't help you understand how to do the poses well...or how to modify the poses based on your skill level. He doesn't mention using blocks for beginners. For example, he brings you into extended side angle (without telling you the name) and then tells you to put your hand flat on the floor, which is a more advanced version of the pose. He does the same with side plank...tells you to stack your heels, which is pretty hard for a beginner. It's easy to hurt yourself without good instruction.

It's also not helpful to be watching people who don't know how to do the poses correctly. If you copy the people in the video, you will be doing the poses wrong.

I am an avid yoga fan and have practiced yoga for a few years.  I'm always looking for a yoga workout I can grow with as well as a yoga workout that makes me feel great.  This is it.

I really like that you can customize this workout by adding a warm up, levels 1-3 and a cool down to make it your own workout.  My recommendation is to start with the level 1 yoga practice, as it definitely offers a challenge, unless you are already a yogi.  But for everyone else, start with level 1 and grow with the yoga practice from there.

I also like that Bob has some of the ""students"" show modifications as well.  There are 3 who do the modified versions of the poses, which is great.  Or, if you're up for a challenge, follow Ali an Bill all the way through.

I have found that, after working with this yoga workout, I am much more flexible, able to go deeper in to the poses and find a great deal of satisfaction with this workout and yoga practice.

I admit when I tried this I was a bit skeptical, as I have done yoga in the past and was not always happy with the results.  As many instructors (in real life or on video) do not always make their routines as cardio as possible, yoga tends to tone and firm but does not always result in weight loss.  Holding the poses are difficult when you want them to be, but you will end up being sweaty and tired at the end without burning as much calories as you would like.

I do ZUMBA about 3 times a week, so I have great endurance but I need to tone.  I thought it was a great workout but wondered if it was really enough of a workout-trust me it is.  I have taken yoga in the past and the class was longer and I did not feel the difference like I do with this DVD. You will see a difference, but you need to do it at least every other day.

He doesn't use the typical ""yoga verbage""..just very plain easy explanations.  If you're a beginner this would work; but for someone who has been doing yoga for awhile, you would probably be disappointed in this routine. Maybe that's why Bob keeps instructing to use this dvd w/ the Biggest Loser Boot Camp routine for the best results.

You'll be dripping with sweat when you're done and if you already have some experience with yoga, you'll still be getting a good workout. Bob's instructions are clear and he keeps you motivated throughout the session. If you(like me) like keeping in shape with minimal time and effort spent, you should definately consider this dvd. The only negativ I might say for this product is that it may get a bit onesided and boring after a while - but by then you will hopefully have supplemented your exercise with additional workouts. Definately worth the money I spent on it!",1268179200,,743,4.511111111111111

If you want a more intense yoga workout I would suggest this one.",1267142400,,263,3.943396226415094
3618608,5,B001GP5TLI,"I've done yoga for years (just as exercise and stress-relief, not to become one of those enviable hard-body professional trainer types.)  Having gotten myself completely out of shape and broke over the last year, I figured I'd check out this DVD.  How hard could it be if  folks who were 100's of pounds overweight were doing it?  Famous last words.

This is an excellent workout, both for those who regularly practice yoga and for beginners, as the instructor - Bob Harper - tells you how to turn the intensity up or down depending on your fitness level.  Another thing I like is that Bob pretty much hits the ground running, the warm up is quick and effective, no chanting or time spent on philosophy (if you're doing this before work, running late and hoping to squeeze in a cup of coffee afterwords this is much appreciated.:)  Also it is surprisingly easy to follow along and correct your form if it's off - I found it easier than in classes, where you are craning your neck around the other students to figure out who is doing it right.

Three small caveats, none enough to individually or collectively detract from the five-star rating: (1) might be worth exploring the notion of breathing a little more.  Bob does some of that, but breathing is so intrinsic to a good and productive practice that an additional minute or so would be well spent. (2) For the beginners, a few of the poses are unexplained and might be confusing the first couple of times.  Eg, Going right from stretches to downward facing dog - if you didn't know what that was you would have to watch the video and figure out the best way to do it without explanation (and dfd is one of the most important poses there is.) (3) I've only been doing the DVD for a month, but I imagine it would get very repetitive after a while.  But this is applicable to ALL exercise DVD's, I would think.  Also, it is well worth keeping on the shelf, this is one a yoga fan would likely come back to over and over again.",1266796800,6,1978,4.448753462603878

Well, this one is tough! Not that the moves themselves are difficult, but it isn't the slow-moving yoga that I prefer. It is, however, a good, challenging work-out. It is meant to help with weight loss and pushes a little harder than I wanted to be pushed, but I think that's the idea of it. Not bad! It's worth a try.",1266364800,,544,4.230769230769231

3618612,5,B001GP5TLI,"If you're looking for a DVD to learn about traditional zen yoga (including the breathing and meditative aspects), this is not the one you should get. That said, the workout integrates many common yoga poses (the Warrior series, plank, down and up dog, triangle) in a way that uses your own body weight to build strength. You hold the poses longer as opposed to flowing between many poses. The final segment uses hand weights while holding and flowing in between poses. The great thing about this DVD is that it tests your mental agility, something that traditional yoga encourages, and your endurance will be utilized, too. Overall, it's a decent workout. It's very challenging. If you've done yoga and pilates before and just got this DVD to mix it up, like I did, you can do the entire DVD without having to build up to the challenges.",1266105600,2,837,4.700680272108843
3618613,5,B001GP5TLI,"This DVD has more problems then I have time to type about. Lots of reviewers already mentioned them. I love it anyway. Make sure you watch it all the way through at least once before you try it.

Bob makes you feel motivated, that the poses are do-able - maybe you can't do that well today, but keep plugging away at it. Whatever you can do today is perfect.

I am no fan of BL, I've seen it maybe 4 times. I do wish Bob would do another DVD because his cheerful encouragement really comes across in this DVD and it's the one I always come back to. I even like the ""big drama"" music which annoyed me at first. I have the next DVD with Jillian Michaels on pre order and I am hoping that it's better then I think it will be. She gets on my nerves!

I have never done any serious yoga before and I am a complete novice and I LOVE this DVD. Bob (the instructor *love him*) is excellent on giving instructions on what to do and how to do it.

Try this DVD. Dont think you can lose weight doing yoga? WRONG. First time I did this DVD my sister and I were sweating like crazy (and shes in good shape). The next day you will be feeling how much work you did. I had (and still have) muscles hurting that I didn't even know I used. TRY IT!  :)",1265673600,2,609,3.9836065573770494

Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that this DVD actually taught me a new pose (awkward airplane...great for your core).  I have been to many different yoga classes and have watched many yoga videos and DVDs, but this is the first DVD I found that incorporates light weights and a medicine ball into practice.  I like the additions of the weights; it keeps the workout fresh.

I loved how fast paced it was, and the ab workout is the best too.

3618619,5,B001GP5TLI,"This is the first workout video I've ever stuck with through all of the ""levels"" in the last 15 years of working out at home! I started from a very low level of physical fitness, so I'm going at a slower pace than ""recommended."" (The DVD recommends to do the workout 4-5 days per week, with 2 weeks per level). I'm using it 3 days per week (as I'm sore enough that I need a rest day in between), and have done 3 weeks per level - but I'm finishing Week 8 now and next week will be my last week on Level 3 before I move to the Maintenance level. The changes in my strength and flexibility are measurable and quite frankly, amazing to me. This workout isn't easy, but it builds my confidence more than the huffing-and-puffing cardio style workouts. I'm dripping sweat by the time I'm done, yet feel completely relaxed. In just this past 2 months, my balance has improved, my strength has increased by what feels like leaps and bounds, and I can now touch my toes! I haven't been able to touch my toes in years! I'd say this workout is geared towards beginners, as the moves are doable even by ""big people"" like me. Even though the people in the video are all former Biggest Loser contestants/winners, it's nice to see them shaking and struggling through some parts just like I do (except for Ally! Man, she is a MACHINE! Go pink team!) Bob Harper is encouraging (though whenever I'm doing the Awkward Airplanes in Level 2, I typically curse him as a sadist). 8 weeks into using this DVD, my motto is now, ""I live for corpse pose!""

For those who whined about this not being a beginning workout, I completely disagree.  It is very much a beginner's workout as you have many alternative poses that still make you sweat.

3618622,5,B001GP5TLI,"As recommended, I bought the ""Weight Loss Yoga"" dvd to compliment the ""Boot Camp"" video. I really wanted a Biggest Loser yoga dvd and boy did they deliver.  I am very very happy with both of these dvd's.  The yoga workout makes me so happy cuz I am pouring sweat through out the workout. Those downward dogs with one leg raised are sheer torture heaven and the plank position a/k/a pushups, well there could not be a better ab workout than this. Plank works my lower pooch area beautifully and even though I have to modify a little, or some would say alot, I know that because I am giving it my all, soon I will be able to do plank without the modifiers. And side plank, well what can be better than that? If anyone says they are not challenged in this workout I'd have to say that they must be in awesome shape. One thing I am not sure about and that is how I am supposed to work the boot camp and the yoga together. I don't know if your supposed to alternate days or do both in one day, so I do the Boot Camp Maximum result workout, about 30 min., then I follow it with Weight loss yoga level one for another 30 min. What can I say, I like to workout. If you are looking for a more mellow yoga workout that flows but does have many of the same poses, try ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" with Suzanne Deason. It shows 4 women working at different levels, I very much enjoy this one for it's more laid back approach on my off days from heavy cardio and grunt workouts.

Bob has you hold the moves long enough that you feel the burn and stretch, but you flow through the movements at a pace that keeps you interested.

His voice sounds like Ryan Cerest, or maybe overall he feels like Ryan. Anyway. It's not easy, at least for me, to follow all of the exercises. Some of them are just a real challenge to your muscles. I do not see it a lot of fun thought. You need to hold some positons for longer than you want and it's a pain.

I have done it twice since I got it 2 days ago, and I am so sore in my core I can hardly laugh!  I only did the Level 1 work so far, so I'm super excited for Level 2 and 3.  Bob is a great instructor and the BL contestants are actually pretty on top of their game in this workout.  I broke a sweat, which is a first for me with Yoga.

3618688,5,B001GP5TLI,"I was actually taken by surprise by this DVD. I usually do the Accelerated Mary Windsor Pilates for an hour. But just level 1 in this Yoga DVD is 20 minutes and I found myself sweating buckets and feeling the burn. If I may be so bold; I was sore in places I didn't even know I HAD hahaha. Allowing us to customize the workout is a blessing. We can choose the option of starting with a warm-up, finishing with a cool down...however we want. I also love that you can choose ""music only"" so you don't have to listen to the fitness instructor all the time; especially if you've been doing these workouts for some time and already know it front to back and don't need to listen to the instructor. Another big plus (at least to me) is the fact that they have amateurs in the back. Most workout videos I've seen and done have everyone going in unison. I don't know about the rest of you, but that always makes me feel like I'm not doing it perfectly or good enough when I watch these people make movements I can't keep up with. In this DVD, you see people struggling and messing up but going right back at it. Makes me really feel like I can go at my own pace since I'm not flexible and my body isn't made of rubber. I recommend this DVD to beginners and advanced workout-aholics alike.",1249344000,32,1280,4.228571428571429

This one definitely gave me a workout!  The kind you feel in every muscle the next day, but not beyond the ability of newbies.  The only complaint, (but not really much of one) is that I wish Bob would have done more of the workout himself to show proper form and make the workout flow a little smoother.  Ali is so much further advanced than any of the other guys, that she tends to go faster than the rest.  It makes it a little hard to follow in the beginning, but once you've done it a few times, not such a big deal anymore.

The only problem for me was that I have osteoporosis and there were a lot of positions where you are putting a lot of pressure on your wrists. With my weak bones, my wrists were really hurting by the end. Other than that I would highly recommend it.",1247443200,,378,4.191780821917808

I planned on doing the entire video yesterday, but I was too tired and sore to do the entire thing after just the warm up, 20-minute session, & cool down.  I got a great workout and am definitely feeling it today.  My back and shoulder muscles are sore (the good way) and I can't wait to do it again today!  I honestly have never seen The Biggest Loser show, so I didn't really know what to expect (the format, whether or not I would like Bob Harper, etc.), but I liked it.  I really enjoyed that there were ""real people"" doing the workouts (I think they were contestants).  That was motivating to me because I just kept thinking, ""If they can do it, I can do it!""  I would definitely recommend this dvd both for those new to yoga and those who have been practicing for some time.  I am relatively new, I've been consistently practicing for about 9 months, and this dvd was perfect for my ability and skill level.  The moves are explained thoroughly, in a way that teaches them how to do the moves for beginners AND helps perfect the moves for people with more experience.

There is not enough explanation of breathing or alignment for those who haven't been doing yoga for a while. Many of the poses are yoga-inspired, but are not actual yoga poses.

I'm a huge Biggest Loser fan, so it was fun to see the contestants in the background because I feel like I know them and can relate to their weight loss struggles.  The DVD is divided into 5 sections (warm-up, basic workout, pilates/abs, strength-training/weight lifting, and cool-down).  The DVD menu allows you to customize your workout so you can do whichever of the sections you would like to do each day.  You can also choose whether to have Bob's instruction and the music or just the music. This feature is really nice when you have done the video enough that you don't need his cues all the time.

By the third time I did this video, I noticed that it was getting easier and that I was more flexible and able to do more.  I always feel great after the workout is over.  Buy this!",1245974400,,860,4.3375
3618697,5,B001GP5TLI,"WOW, this DVD was an amazing workout. I've been a yogi for about 3 years now and when I bought this DVD, I underestimated how much it tested my endurance and made me sweat. This workout is NOT just for the beginners but is JUST as hard of a workout for the intermediates and advanced yogis. There are 3 levels:

Level One: 20 minutes of basic level yoga stretches and maneuvers which include Warrior 1 and 2 and Downward Facing Dog. These yoga moves work out your lower body as well as your endurance in your arms.

Level 2: 15 minutes of yoga ab work and pilates. You feel the burn as soon as you get into bridge pose.

Level 3: 10 minutes of strength work using light weights, lots of upper body and arm work.

You'll definitely break a sweat. Bob does a great job keeping you motivated even though you may get annoyed by his voice at times. All the Biggest Loser contestants show you a number of modifications as well.

I like how you can create your own workout routine by adding or removing the three levels.

There's a warmup and cooldown and three levels of exercise that can be done separetly or in any combination you choose.  The joy of this tape of course is Bob.  He reaches through the screen and makes the viewer feel that he is training only you.  His charm and encouragement helps you maintain the active pose just a little bit longer than you would have if you didn't feel that he was watching you.  You will get a good workout beginning with the basics through advanced levels.

3618702,4,B001GP5TLI,"I have always enjoyed yoga, how it centers my energy and focus, provides me with peace and clarity, and stretches and tones my muscles in the process as well. I also am an avid health nut and love encouraging others to be the same. Therefore, it wasn't long until I discovered NBC's The Biggest Loser. While I consider myself a healthy person, to this day I would love to be trained by Bob Harper. When I came across this DVD I was excited to incorporate all three passions, yoga, health, and my increasing crush on Bob. However, this is not typical yoga, and if you were looking for a traditional format this is not the DVD for you.

  However, if you love Bob, then you are going to be eventually won over by this dvd. Not only does it give you workout options, including separate levels 1-3, and a combined 6-week Maximum Results Weight Loss Program, it also allows you to practice Bob's instructions with background music, or simply music (for the better acquainted). I have to say that despite being healthy and well-versed in Yoga, the sequence and tempo of reps in level 1, even gave me difficulty. I would recommend following the 6-Week Max Program, as it inherintly builds the home participant to the more advanced levels healthily.

  there are definitely some drawbacks with this DVD, including the personalities of previous contestants, and the lack of traditional yoga practices, but that is simply remedied by it being titled WEIGHT LOSS YOGA. I would strongly recommend a yoga mat, and if you want to follow the exercises precisely, variations are observed, a medicine ball for later levels as well, but that is at your own discretion.

  I thoroughly enjoy this dvd, this along with Bob's Bootcamp DVD, which I own as well, along with a myriad of other fitness videos are great additions to anyone's fitness regime. For me, it is a must buy.

The results was the biggest testimonial for me.  I'd been doing a bootcamp class for 6 weeks and lost a few pounds but then did this dvd, and the first week I lost 2.5lbs and 3 inches.  I am seeing more results with this dvd than I did with the bootcamp (not biggest loser bootcamp).

I love the amount and timely instructions given for each pose.  I found the music not new age, but real.  I love the options the dvd allows you to customize the video or do the predetermined instructions.  Great for mixing it up.

I might find my mind busy at the beginning of the exercise video and within minutes I am relaxed and focused.  I am rejuvenated at the end of the dvd.  I used to take a nap each day, instead I do this video in the place of it and get more energy to keep up with my son.

3618711,5,B001GP5TLI,"First of all, let me give the disclaimer that I have only done this workout a few times thus far.  However, that being said, I have been EXTREMELY impressed with it.

The warm-up really gets me feeling loose and focused, and Bob is a very good instructor.  He's very calm and encouraging (which, if you watch The Biggest Loser, you know is not always the case!).

Level 1 is pretty good, although it's fairly repetitive.  As a complete yoga novice, I felt the burn right away in my legs and arms from holding the poses for so long.  It does get really tiring after a while, but you feel (or at least I felt) so much more energized after.

I haven't done Levels 2 and 3 yet - still working up to those!

The cool down feels oh-so-good on the aching muscles - you're never pushed too far, but you feel stretched after finishing.  I like to do this dvd right before bed, because it helps me calm down after long days.

The BEST thing about this dvd is the actual format of the dvd itself - I love how you can literally ""build your own"" workout.  It's so helpful to not be skipping through chapters, which is such a horrible distraction from a workout.

All in all, I love this dvd.  I'm already feeling more flexible, and walk with more confidence.  I can't wait to see even more results!",1242432000,13,1285,4.3
3618712,5,B001GP5TLI,This is an excellent yoga video!  There are several work outs you can choose from including yoga with weights. Bob goes step by step through all the poses and encourages you to stay focus. It is a great compliment to your yoga practice.,1242345600,,236,4.488372093023256

3618714,5,B001GP5TLI,"So I have been doing this video for about 6 weeks now and I have finally progressed to the end and done level 3 twice now!  Let me tell you it is worth the time and effort put into getting to level 3.  My body has completely transformed in the short amount of time I have been doing this workout---my arms are stronger, leaner, toned, and more muscular and my thighs,calves, hamstrings are wayyyy more toned than before.  My butt is smaller, my back is more muscular, and my stomach/abs/core is much more toned and I have lost a lot of fat and inches from my waist and hips.  This workout literally stretches you out giving you ""long, lean muscles"" as Bob would say haha.  I've never done a workout that makes my muscles burn the way this one does and I love the way I feel after doing it!

I have been using this video along with the 30 day shred and doing added cardio along with eating healthy and have seen amazing results! So I think the 30 day shred has contributed immensely to my results but I know that this workout is responsible for my strength and lean muscles.  The only thing that kills me in this video is holding the side plank for so long and listening to Bob talk ""Shake it out Bernie"" and ""how is he still holding this up? When is Bob going to stop talking?"" At that point in the workout my arms are shaking sooo bad and I feel like I am going to break my arm from holding myself up but then Bob finally takes you out of it! I love Bob though!

If you are looking to see a huge difference in your body don't hesitate, buy this DVD!  I also just recently ordered Jillian Michaels two other DVDs to add to my workout routine because I am now much more motivated to continue after seeing what this yoga video has done for me!

Walking down the stairs was painful  I needed a low impact workout.  I discussed my troubles with a friend who works at a PT center. She told me about this DVD.  I was skeptical of course, because of the commercial appeal of biggest loser.
This is an amazing workout.  You absolutely sweat.  Think of it this way, strength training with your own body weight.
Bob can get a little annoying with his chatter but look beyond that and I belive you will be pleased.  If you are already a yoga buff this probably isn't for you.
I am happy to say that I am on the mend with my tendonitis.  I can run a few times a week but I am only up to 2.5 miles.  The DVD helped me stay conditioned and kept my frustration level at a minimum.",1242000000,,861,4.195121951219512

Whether or not this is the best DVD for yoga is up for debate, but after years of struggling with my weight and working out hardcore for months at a time without seeing any results, I feel so motivated now that I'm back to doing yoga.  I haven't lost weight as of yet, but I see results by the fact that each day I do the DVD, I can go a little deeper into the position or can hold a position a little longer.  I've just recently added the Boot Camp DVD to it, so hopefully I can see some more results soon.  To anyone who did it one time and was frustrated because it was too difficult, keep trying.  I probably only got half way through my first day, now I just need to be able to hold plank as long as he asks.  I'm getting closer each time I do it.

I enjoy working out with BL champs (wish Heba and Vicky weren't there, they don't add much except that I'm pretty sure I'm doing better than they are).

I do love that you can customize your workout, if you have time or physical constraints.  Sometimes I simply do the warm-up and the cool-down - a great stretching routine.

I followed the ""Maximum Results"" plan for the first 6 weeks - a gradually-increasing-intensity workout that makes sense.  Now I pretty much do what I have time for, or whether I want to lift weights etc.

Great for people with past injuries as it works on stretching and strengthing your core. My fiance who has a past hip injury and bad knees used the modified versions of some poses with ease.

3618749,5,B001GP5TLI,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees).  I bought this DVD in a store for [..], and can't believe how good it is.  I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain.  My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility.  I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again.

This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose.  He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits.  He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover.  He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time.  Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be.  I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time.

Overall, this was a great yoga workout.  Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob.  =D",1237248000,16,1731,4.436708860759493

The moves are fairly easy and they have people of differing abilities to follow for different levels of fitness.

3618754,5,B001GP5TLI,"This is the DVD for you!!!!! Quit doing all that high impact exercise and really get in touch with connecting your mind and body while sweating!  What does that mean.....One of the greatest things about yoga is that as you continue, with each workout you really literally feel your muscles lengthen and your body strengthen and your mind relax. With other types of exercise, your goal is to count reps or miles and that is really it. That is all they brag about. People think they are the all around athelete, but until you discover yoga you have no clue. With running and strength training w/ weights, you actually shorten your muscles.  If you don't lengthen them out, you'll be hunched over as you age. Look around you and you see those athelets with the rolled forward look who cannot even straighten out their legs, not sexy.  I have been doing yoga for over 5 years now, and this DVD really has helped me to advance to a new level. Pains I had before I started are so history. Sure the basic poses are the same but that is the thing with yoga, each yoga class has its uniqueness.

The key for me was weight loss. You will sweat a bit with this one but then you will look forward to the cool down. I am on the heavier side so those of you looking for a starter exercise. This is it. The only downside is I need the trainer to call me and remind me to pop it in the DVD and get moving. It does not take away the laziness of not wanting to exercise.

I'm going to follow the 6wk plan to, hopefully, build up to lever 3. If I remember I'll come back and edit this and let you know how it went and how the weight loss went.

Yoga is often perceived as being easy, even though it can be quite difficult.  I think Bob does a great job of making the poses achievable, while still being challenging.  He builds the workout up in three phases so you don't have to worry about the harder poses until you're ready for them.

Bob is adamant that yoga should be enjoyable and I think he's succeeded in creating a workout that's challenging, but highly enjoyable.  My husband did this one with me and couldn't believe how much of a workout it really was!",1235433600,,614,4.495495495495495

3618779,4,B001GP5TLI,"I just got this yesterday and tried it today, i loved it.  I've always wanted to try yoga and I am NOT very flexible.  this was very enjoyable, made my muscles burn, but Bob keeps you going.",1232841600,2,190,4.108108108108108
3618780,5,B001GP5TLI,"I am a big fan of the Biggest Loser and find that Bob Harper is quite the inspiration.  This is my first Biggest Loser DVD after being a diehard fan for all of the TV seasons.  I must say I thought that this DVD wouldn't do much for me but would a good way to mix up my daily work outs of running at least 5 miles a day and lifting weights.  The day after I did this DVD work out, I was so sore I could barely breathe without it hurting!!  I was amazed what this yoga work out did to my body!  By the end of the work out I was sweating like crazy!!  Two days later (after my soreness from the first time went down) I did this DVD again.  The next day I wasn't as sore but I could definitely feel it in my abs and arms.  It's GREAT and it's not like you're typical work out where you feel like you're working really hard.  It's fun and super easy to follow.  It's also great that you're able to design your own workouts so you're not doing the same thing over and over again.  I recommend it for anyone who is looking to get into yoga and is a fan of the Biggest Loser.",1232582400,18,1068,3.853211009174312
3618781,5,B001GP5TLI,Great for beginners and people who are not flexible or lack strength.  I love Bobs style of teaching yoga.  Very easy to follow!!  Love this DVD!!!,1232323200,,147,4.576923076923077
3618782,5,B001GP5TLI,"I hate yoga and have never taken a yoga class that has left me feeling anything other than irritated and in pain. This one is totally different and I am loving it! After doing the Biggest Loser Workout and the 5 minute cool down/yoga section with Bob I thought, ""This was actually kinda nice. If only Bob had his own, full-length yoga video."" Well, apparently Santa was listening because just 2 days after Christmas, there it was on Amazon; just waiting for me.

This workout is just that - a workout! For those that think yoga is easy and you don't get good exercise from it, they should definitely try this. Bob does strength moves for your whole body, leaving you feeling stronger, fitter, and a little tired at the end. This is a great addition to any workout video collection!",1231891200,29,781,4.539007092198582
3618783,5,B001GP5TLI,"I love Bob, I love this program.  I believe in him.  I know he is the one who is going to make me thin again.  I am on my way.  The weights coming off.  I have all the biggest loser books, cd's, and products.  The newest book coming in Feb,(The 30 Day Plan) that I already have reserved thru Amazon.  I thank God and my Trainer Bob for the thinner and healthier BJ coming this year of new beginnings 2009!!!",1231718400,,407,4.0125
3618784,5,B001GP5TLI,"I wanted to mix up my normal routine of running and other Biggest Loser workout dvds,such as Cardio Max and Power Sculpt,with this Yoga workout. Well, it is quite a workout! It works your body in a completely new way. You use your own body weight to complete the moves, and just doing level one, I began to sweat down my back and I am in good shape.
I definitely recommend this dvd if you are looking for something new. :)",1231718400,,422,4.222222222222222
3618785,5,B001GP5TLI,"I run and swim and like to mix in a little yoga.  I've taken a few yoga classes and am a fan of the Rodney Yee/Muriel Hemingway Yoga Now series.  Bought this DVD on a whim since I like Bob Harper...and found the workout was much harder than I anticipated.  This is a quality workout at an amazing price point.  And as always, Bob's calm, friendly personality comes through...while still pushing you to reach your goals.",1231632000,,419,4.473684210526316
3618786,5,B001GP5TLI,"Great Yoga DVD, especially for those new to yoga.  I've had a good handful of yoga classes and my husband's had a few.  We both really benefit from Bob's instruction, particularly on form.  It's one thing to say, ""keep your back straight,"" or ""make sure you watch your form,"" but Bob instructs as if you've never had a yoga class in your life, which is good--both for newbies and those of us who aren't experts yet.  He actually shows you what good knee alignment looks like.  Or tells you how it should feel.  I agree with one of the reviewers that it's a little awkward (okay, a lot awkward) to be in a yoga pose and have to look up at the TV, but that's really the same as being in class--I would have to look at an instructor to see what's going on sometimes--but after a week or two of doing this, you get the hang of it and know what to do.

The BEST part of the Biggest Loser videos are the interactive menus so you can select what kind of workout you want to do.  What an AWESOME idea!  Finally!  Someone helps me cut out the stuff I don't need or let's me build a longer workout and it plays exactly how I selected it.

And hey, if you're a dude, you'll like this because Bob leads the session. It's not just for girls. (And not just for skinny girls either.) Besides, there's none of that swirly yoga-ish, indian flute music with perfectly carved bodies flawlessly moving from pose to pose.  It's basic instruction (with light background music), and you see the other participants (past BL contestants) make mistakes along the way just like most of us do when we're taking a yoga class.  So what if you put your right leg in the air when everyone else puts up their left.  That's what I love about this DVD!  While I'm sure they spent a lot of ""takes"" shooting the DVD, they didn't aim for absolute perfection. Hey, life isn't perfect and I've yet to have a perfect yoga class. The fact that I got my tail out of bed to even do this each morning is as much perfect I can expect right now.

Yes, there's a lot of ""plank,"" which is actually good for weight loss yoga.  I have to admit that my arms were killing me during a lot of the warrior 2 poses, but I turned to my husband and said, ""Just think, in a couple of weeks this will be so much easier for us!""

ps: Bob's Biggest Loser Boot Camp is fun too!",1231113600,697,2313,4.1945701357466065
3618787,5,B001GP5TLI,"I've taken a fair share of yoga classes and I have to say this DVD is incredibly fun! I consider myself somewhat a beginner and found this workout challenging during the first week, and as time went on and I moved up in levels, the workouts remained challenging and engaging. Bob is absolutely great in this video! He is excellent at keeping you motivated and setting the right tone for the workout. You will definitely feel like you're burning tons of calories. I've sat through boring yoga videos with sleepy music, and this is not that! It feels up-to-date and stays fun the entire time, highly recommended!!!! :)",1230854400,11,616,4.712962962962963
3618788,5,B001GP5TLI,"I love the Biggest Loser dvds and I purchased this one with the Bootcamp dvd when i found out they were coming out and let me tell you, I was especially surprised with this yoga workout!  I did the whole 55 minutes and even being an advanced workout buff, I couldn't believe how challenging this workout was! I know I'm definately going to feel it tomorrow. Right now I'm rotating these with the Power Sculpt and Cardio Max Dvds and I couldn't be happier! I was actually sweating doing yoga, crazy good!",1230854400,8,503,4.467391304347826

I liked that it wasn't just super thin folk exercising with this guy. I loved the encouragement and that he showed ways to modify it if you weren't quite there with flexibility yet. Also you can choose which segments you want to do at the beginning from warm up, to yoga 1, yoga 2, yoga 3, and cool down. I will consider getting other workout dvds from this guy. I still won't watch the show though because I am fundamentally opposed to the idea that you can lose that much weight that quickly and keep it off.",1523836800,,621,4.271186440677966
