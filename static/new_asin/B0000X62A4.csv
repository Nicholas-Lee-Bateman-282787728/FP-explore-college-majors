8004306,5,B0000X62A4,great video and easy to do. I would highly recommend it. I needed this to help with my back problems.,1401580800,,101,4.1
8004307,5,B0000X62A4,"This gently invigorating video is not your typical pilates video. Think of it more as the skeleton of pilates that you may not normally see separated from the skin and muscles. Sunrise workout uses classic pilates movements a little differently. For instance, the hundred is done kneeling and the mermaid is done standing. Of course there are exercises done lying down as well. It devotes a good amount to shoulder girdle stabilization (something I do not see addressed in other dvds except for Fletcher's) and really wakes up the upper body including the neck! I really like this dvd. It is a refreshingly great addition to your classic pilates collection to keep things fresh, new and interesting. It really teaches you the foundation and principles of pilates in a way that I am yet to see on any pilates dvds. A must have for all pilates students from newbees to advance students.",1367712000,11,884,4.822368421052632
8004308,5,B0000X62A4,"Honestly, my DVD player died on me and I found this workout on youtube (the complete workout is on youtube broken into two sections roughly 10 minutes each).  I did this mat workout for a week until I got a new DVD player, however simple it was, it was powerful for me and effective.  I ended up purchasing it!  Combine this 22-minute basic Pilates workout with any of your other favorite short workouts.  It's truly a gem!",1363996800,3,423,4.454545454545454
