It's kind of trash now, and looks and sounds more like a lot of musicians trying to make a buck than people who knew about a hard life.  I was in constant physical pain from an accident, and not doing very well emotionally.  This sort of music brought me comfort.

The beats are good, the guitars ok, the singers scream monotonously whatever the words are.  I'd give it an honest 3 stars on production, more if you're feeling it. Good luck if you are, these are heavy songs, between the typical mainstream MTV metal and death metal.  Supremazist much?  I dunno, no idea what he words are.",1495238400,,649,4.4033613445378155
