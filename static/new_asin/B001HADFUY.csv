3627523,5,B001HADFUY,"""You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown"" is the seventh in the Peanuts series, to get the Remastered Special Edition treatment, since Warner Brothers began with ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" in 2008. In this release, both the picture and the audio have been remastered, and look and sound like never before!

This lesser known Peanuts special, tells the story of Charlie Brown's hopes to win the motorcross race, despite being ""Unlucky Number 13"". It's a great story for adults and children alike, which lends virtue to not only winning, but to playing as a good sport, in the process. It's perfect for the adult who's feeling nostalgic, or as an introduction to good sportsmanship, to your little ones!

The DVD includes a bonus episode, ""You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown"", which centers about Charlie Brown's hopes to win a decathlon, with the help of Snoopy & the gang. It also includes the all-new featurette, ""Dust Yourself Off & Pick Yourself Up, Charlie Brown"", the story of Charles Schultze's son Craig, who served as the inspiration behind ""You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown"".

It's another great Peanuts release, and hopefully a sign that more Charlie Brown releases are headed our way!",1231027200,21,1198,5.010050251256281

3627550,5,B001HADFUY,"If you want a good laugh watch this dvd.  Charlie Brown is a good child, but too trusting especially to Lucy with the kicking of the football.  He joins the track team to help his school possibly win the track meet by entering the decathalon and ends up disappointing himself and his school when he was told he might win the decathalon and his head gets too big and he does not pay attention to where his going when he is running in the final track event, buy this dvd, it's a keeper.

3627562,5,B001HADFUY,"First, I have to give credit to Warner Brothers for doing an incredible job on the remastering. The cartoons look as good if not better than they did when they first aired.

Second, I feel quite lucky to have stumbled on this as it was my favorite Peanuts story as a kid. I used to own this in book form and always thought it was a fun story. There aren't many slow moments and, as someone else mentions, Charlie Brown finally gets to win one... even if the prize wasn't quite as spectacular as he might have hoped. The supporting characters are really at their best and most humorous. I LOVE the Marcie 'Howard Cosell' interview spoof and Linus's rant about the big kids always hogging the court.

I agree with another reviewer that the Wizard of Oz opening was unexpected and can certainly trouble some kids. I was worried mine might freak out but lucked out- she was interested in who the four characters were. Other than that I think this is a great DVD to add to your children's or nostalgic adult's collection.",1313625600,2,1016,4.486486486486487
3627563,5,B001HADFUY,My 5-year-old enjoyed watching this Charlie Brown DVD.  It had a much more positive tone than many of the older Peanuts episodes.,1295740800,,129,4.863636363636363
3627564,4,B001HADFUY,"My kids love Charlie Brown but am I the only one whose kids were traumatized by the Wizard of Oz sequence at the beginning, substituting for the standard FBI ""do not copy"" message?  One of my kids is so freaked out by it that we can't even watch the movie.  Taking him out of the room with the volume down is not enough............just knowing the Wizard of Oz is on the TV is way too scary.  Adding those scary sequences from the Wizard of Oz was completely unnecessary and pretty much ruined my older son's birthday present, who really would like to watch the DVD, but can't now.  Come on guys!!!!!",1277164800,3,600,4.378378378378378
3627565,5,B001HADFUY,My Son loves this he watches all of the Charlie Brown dvd's. At least one a day. He loves this one because it has motorcycles like his daddy does. I would buy another any day from this seller.,1277078400,,192,4.078947368421052
3627566,4,B001HADFUY,"Somewhat reflective of its time (mid-70s), but still generally true to the Peanuts spirit. There are two ""specials"" on this disc which I honestly do not remember ever seeing. They are not of the same caliber as other Peanuts specials, but they are still very pleasant and enjoyable.",1271894400,,282,4.895833333333333
3627567,3,B001HADFUY,"The two shows on this set are nothing special.  In terms of content, they lacked any of the complexity that makes some Peanuts shows so excellent.  The two cartoons on this disc may be better suited to younger kids, as the messages are positive and there isn't as much verbal abuse between the characters.  For the older kids (and adults), it's hard to beat 'Snoopy Come Home', 'It's Magic, Charlie Brown' (see the remastered deluxe edition of 'It's the Great Pumpkin'), or 'What a nightmare, Charlie Brown'.

If only the shows on this disc were as good as the DVD production and special features.  Although I found the guest speaker views on Charlie Brown and the gang a little maudlin and kind of silly, I do appreciate that this edition came with special features.  'You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown' gets an A for production, a C for story and entertainment value.  'Snoopy, Come Home' (1972) which I incidentally picked up at the same time as this one - was fantastic (although arguably better suited to 'mature' audiences - violent, funny, and putting you through an emotional wringer - this is the definition of 5 star Peanuts!).",1258329600,,1138,4.746192893401015
3627568,5,B001HADFUY,This DVD brings back to mind my childhood. sitting and watching Charlie Brown. I always feel sorry for him as nothing seems to go right for his but things always seem to work out anyway. I am sure many kids can relate to Charlie Brown.,1252713600,,235,4.2444444444444445
3627569,5,B001HADFUY,"This is one of my favorite Charlie Brown specials that were on t.v. when I was a kid.  Charlie Brown gets talked into joining the motorcross that includes riders Peppermint Patty and Snoopy as the Masked Marvel.  It brought back a lot of memories and also contains another great bonus special called ""You're the Greatest Charlie Brown!"".  If you liked the Charlie Brown specials as a kid, you'll love these.",1241654400,2,407,4.785714285714286
3627570,5,B001HADFUY,"You can't beat Charlie Brown for good family viewing.  This one is great, and I haven't seen it since I was a kid but it still is very entertaining.",1236902400,,148,4.103448275862069
3627571,5,B001HADFUY,"Irregardless to the reproduction of the analog-to-digital technology, Charles Schulz and family have produced one of the best written cartoons in the lifespan of America.  I can count on my one hand the names of cartoonists whose work is embedded in my video/dvd/tape collection.

My only gripe is not of the Schulz's library, but of the reproduction team who dispenses redigitized episodes on dvd with only two or three 24 minute shows on a disc!  AND the fee for such is over the top charge.

Again, it is American.  It is classic style, too.",1236124800,,544,4.74468085106383
3627572,4,B001HADFUY,This is a great lesser known video that teaches kids good sportsmanship while having a few laughs along the way. My daughter loves this one. I used to have the book.,1236124800,,165,4.354838709677419
3627573,5,B001HADFUY,"YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN was a Peanuts special that first aired on television in 1975.  Charles Schulz published original ""Peanuts"" strips for fifty years, from 1950-2000.  YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLE BROWN aired in what is now the halfway point of the original strips publication.  It's not as well known as some of the other Peanuts specials that were broadcast, but is rather memorable because it features Charlie Brown winning at something instead of losing.

The main plot follows Charlie, Snoopy (as the Masked Marvel), and Peppermint Patty as they compete in a motocross race (a sport that was fairly new at the time the special first aired).  Unlike Patty who has a new bike, or the Masked Marvel who has the best bike around at the time, Charlie Brown can only afford the cheapest bike the store sells.  There is no shine or gloss to his bike and it doesn't rev but puts.  Not only that, but Charlie Brown's bike is entered into the competition as #13, supposedly the unluckiest of all numbers. Still, Charlie Brown is a determined fellow and like the tortoise who beat the hair, sometimes slow and steady does when the race. Besides seeing what a good sport Charlie Brown, the special is also notable because of the make-shift pumpkin helmet Linus makes after Charlie is in an accident.  The motocross race is preceded by a scene with Snoopy playing tennis and followed by the Peanuts gang playing baseball. YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Special.

Also included on this the special, YOU'RE THE GREATEST, CHARLIE BROWN. In this special Charlie is recruited to represent his school by competing in the decathlon for the Junior Olympics.  Peppermint Patty trains Chuck in all ten events. Charlie Brown wins several events and has a chance to win the entire Junior Olympics for his school.  I remember seeing this scene on television several times when I was a kid. It was one of several specials that I particularly enjoyed because of the ironic ending. Both of the Peanuts specials on the disc have been remastered and cleaned up.  They look and sound spectacular.

This DVD also includes the featurette, ""Dust Yourself Off & Pick Yourself Up, Charlie Brown"" which features Craig Schulz, one of Charles Schulz' sons, explaining how his teenage hobby served as the inspiration for YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN.

YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN is a lesser known Peanuts special, but it's one that every Peanuts or Charlie Brown fan should have in their personal DVD library.",1234224000,7,2544,4.858796296296297
3627574,5,B001HADFUY,"Yippee, yippee....it's about time and although I still have this classic on VHS, I will still buy the DVD....as I'm sure it has been remastered to perfection. Aside from the wonderful characters and story line, I love the music the best.",1233705600,3,237,4.804878048780488
8308276,5,B001HADFUY,Adorable.,1521849600,,9,9.0
8308277,5,B001HADFUY,"The primary feature, Youre a Good Sport, is one of my favorites of all the Charlie Brown shows. For whatever reason, I like to play it in the fall season every year. Maybe its becsuse the leavesssre turning in this episode or maybe thats when I originally saw it as a kid.

Snoopy playing tennis is so funny, and he gets even better as the Masked Marvel. The pacing in this special is good and it keeps loving without slowing down, which always holds my kids interest.

Lots of smiles and chuckles in this one, and the music is fantastic.

The second special, Youre the Greatest, is ... okay. Its more of a throwaway special and we don't watch it as often.

Easily worth the price, though, for the first special. Highly recommended.",1515801600,,732,4.481203007518797
