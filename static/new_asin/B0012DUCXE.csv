8245196,2,B0012DUCXE,"This is not the movie I thought I was ordering, but I thought I would give it a chance since I wanted a depiction of the Turkish view of this war.

This film seems to be copied from a VHS to DVD, the DVD has the appearance of a DVD-R or DVD-RW, and the resulting copy is of poor to fair quality.

The movie clearly a low budget Turkish movie, made in the early 60s or so.  Very poor cinematography and editing. It re-runs the same footage so frequently that it is obvious.  It includes footage either from WWII movies or actual WWII footage, totally out of place in a WWI depiction.  Poor overdubbing, everyone seems to have the same voice and the interpretation is poor.  Acting is substandard in comparison with early B movies, I have seen better acting in silent movies.  ""Birth of a Nation"" did a better job of depicting the American Civil war than this did of the Gallipoli Campaign.

Maybe I'm being too critical for the age of this film, but I hope the Turkish film industry has improved since this movie was put together.",1415923200,,1029,4.378947368421053
