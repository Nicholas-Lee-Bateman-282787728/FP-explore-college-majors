6708330,5,B00O35YLTE,"I ordered this DVD not knowing its quality. But given the superior quality of this Western film, I decided to take a chance (there had been no other reviews of it before mine). The DVD came quickly, and I am very pleased to state that the DVD quality is very good, so there is no need to be concerned about that issue (the company making this fine Western available is ATI, and they've also issued several other films, including A MAN WITHOUT A STAR, with Kirk Douglas, which is also in an excellent quality issue. Both are DVD-R formatted).

A DAY OF FURY is a superior Western, bringing together two fine leads in Dale Robertson and Jock Mahoney. In some ways it is an extended character study of what happens to a town when a stranger enters and literally tears away and reveals the hidden secrets and flaws of many of the prominent citizens of that town. Robertson, who got his first real break with Randy Scott in FIGHTING MAN OF THE PLAINS (as Jesse James) is cast as Jagade, the gunslinger who serves as the instrument of this ""cleansing."" Mahoney, who had graduated from his secondary roles in series B-Westerns (with Charles Starrett, the Durango Kid), co-stars as Marshal Burnett, who, due to a favor owed Jagade, at first allows Robertson to stir things up, but then is forced to take him on.

As usual, Universal assembled a solid cast, including John Dehner, Carl Benton Reid, and a particularly nasty (and always grinning) Jan Sterling. Mara Corday supplies the major female presence.

Dialogue is crisp and natural, and the plot continually has twists and turns that maintain interest.  While the film explores the darker reaches of character, there is also a lot of good, old-fashioned action.  In short, I can highly recommend this issue to anyone searching for superior Western action and entertainment from the mid- to late 1950s. Thank you ATI for releasing this fine film!",1439424000,11,1893,4.759146341463414
8681799,4,B00O35YLTE,"An interesting, taut western drama that effectively showcases everyone's talent. Jagade, Dale's character, is representative of a kind of 'evil' in a society that prides itself in being good. Dale is thrilling as this malevolent force that shows up the false goodness of the town.",1517961600,,280,5.2444444444444445
8681800,5,B00O35YLTE,"Very fast paced and action packed.  I bought this for me because I have always been a Dale Robertson fan,  but my husband watched it first and loved it.  He said he couldn't leave for one second for fear of missing something.  That is quite a recommendation since he is hard to please with his movies.  Unfortunately he told me the ending before I got a chance to view it, but I still loved it and we will both be watching it over and over.",1505088000,,440,4.129411764705883
