4081220,5,B0037FFBCC,"As a former out of control diabetic, who had a severe infection in my leg - that could have easily lead to amputation, I can assure you that the information in this DVD can not only help your diabetes and weight but could save your life.

It is simple - it's cutting out a few foods, adding a ton of awesome foods and with that - starting a path to reversing diabetes. Because of the work that Dr. Barnard has done I was able to get off all diabetes meds and have lost 150 pounds so far. It is NOT hard. It is a matter of a month or so to change your habits.

You owe it to yourself to find out about the truth about T2 diabetes and how to reverse it. The DVD is a good intro - I highly recommend Dr. Barnard's other book ""Taking Control of Diabetes"" as well as Dr. T. Collin Campbells book ""The China Study"". Become educated about this horrible disease, and know there is hope!",1277424000,88,878,4.069364161849711
4081221,4,B0037FFBCC,"Dr. Barnard's ""Tackling Diabetes"" is only for those willing to listen carefully and summon up th discipline to follow his not-too-complicated Rx. It helps! I may later be able to say the type II I struggle with is gone. For the moment, I can say without hesitation, my blood sugar is considerably lower in the morning, which has been a constant problem for me. His clear, uncomplicated recommendations require commitment to a pattern of eating that can drastically reduce the presence of high glucose in one's blood, help reduce weight, and help bring about a certain amount of personal peace.

My opinion is that all plans to 'self treat' diabetes should be shared with one's doctor.",1277337600,37,684,4.896551724137931

4081224,5,B0037FFBCC,"A MUST for those with diabetes type 2!  Learn what contributes to your body's inability to handle sugar--why it is insulin resistant.  That saturated fat is getting INSIDE your cells so the most important thing is cutting down on saturated fat--mostly in animal products.  If you are not willing to go that far, you will always have diabetes as that fat is gumming up the inner workings of your cells (as well as your arteries and heart).  Alas I know some people would rather go for short-term satisfaction rather than long-term health and feeling better, but at least you will know the reason.  Sad as we teach ourselves to like what we like.  We can just as easily teach ourselves to like what is truly good for us!  If we take the time, we will get both short-term satisfaction AND long-term health and feeling better--with no loss of enjoyment at all!",1423958400,3,856,4.629139072847682

The book consists of mostly case studies from other diabetics. The recipes in the book are filled with a LOT of tofu and spices. Spices that my body can't tolerate. LOTS of peppers, coriander, cumin. Personally I would be puking my guts out after eating these meals. And when I say no beef, fish or fowl. You would have to give them all up permanently. It's easier being a diabetic.

This was not an overnight thing, but it happened very quickly, because not only did his blood sugar get back into normal range, but his weight is dropping, and his blood pressure is back to normal if not better then normal. One day he called me and was very concerned, because he had a blood sugar reading in the 80s, I asked him if he felt OK, and he replied; I feel greatbut he was nervous about the low reading because he hadnt had that low of reading since he was diagnosed with diabetes.  He has had his blood work done and almost all of his reading are in the normal range, and the funny thing about it was the nurse called him with his blood results, and was concerned she had to inform him he was pre-diabeticmy husband laughed, and asked her if she had even looked at his records, because just 6 months prior he was considered diabetic with a A1C of 9.0 and now its 6.0so yes, we would recommend this book to anyone even if you are not diabetic!",1361750400,6,1204,4.203463203463204

However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe.  This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup.  The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count.  Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.,1359072000,,395,4.297297297297297

I can imagine that strict Whole Food Vegan Diet can achieve even more and faster. Eating Rye also helps, My  diet now is >95% Vegan (No Meat & Milk products)! A1C test after 6 month is down to 5.5 (Back to normal range & Off Blood Sugar medication for now). In order to achieve long term success, it is important to have a strong understandings of the medical reasons behind it, what Diabetes can harm us otherwise(long term drug therapy has many negative side effects and hurt our kidney that will lead to Kidney Dialysis), develop vegetarian shopping+cooking skills, strong family and/or close friends supports and a family doctor that can understand/appreciate vegetarian diet also help.

My husbands blood sugars have stabalized in the low numbers, hopefully with deleting some of his meds in the near future and we are anxious to see how much our cholesterol has changed.  The program is certainly different for those of us who have loved meat and ate way more fat than needed.  Biggest challenge it to try new foods and establish a variety of meals. So far we have found ourselves quite satisfied and not feeling hungry. It is certainly a very healthy way of eating and planning to continue this program.

4081298,5,B0037FFBCC,"Don't let the title of this video stop you from viewing it if you don't have diabetes.  It deserves a much wider audience.  The first hour of the video is a discussion by Dr. Barnard of the benefits of a vegan diet for those with diabetes, heart disease, and weight management issues, as well as those who want to stay healthy and avoid developing any of these problems.  This is not a diet in the traditional sense.  You eat as much as you want of any high fiber, low fat foods.  All foods fitting this description are plant based, so you are eliminating all animal products from your diet.  He gives simple guidelines on how to make healthy eating choices and explains how these choices affect your health.  He also gives good tips on the easiest ways to make these changes in your diet.  This portion of the video has aired on PBS.  The next segment is a Vegan Primer cooking class with Chef Fiore, who demonstrates the preparation of several easy and delicious vegan recipes.  Be ready to take notes on this part so you can try the recipes yourself.  They're excellent!  The last segment of the video is a trip to the supermarket with a nutritionist, who walks you through the market explaining how to find the most nutritious foods in your local grocery store.

For many years I've struggled with chronic fatigue and an extra 25 pounds that I couldn't lose.

4081301,5,B0037FFBCC,"I saw the video on PBS, the information is invaluable. If you haven't seen the show on tv, spend the $12 its a bargain!

This information battles the biggest dangers faced by Americans today; diabetes, obesity, heart disease and ignorance.  As the Dr. points out, the modern diet is poison to the human body.  The human body was developed eons ago before packaged foods, meat, sugar and when being active was required for survival. Our lifestyles have changed but our bodies are still programmed like we were cavemen.  Sorry Geico.

There is a lot of misinformation in the market and the good Doctor breaks through those myths and outright lies.  Food labeled low fat, healthy and so on are often part of the problem. Sugar is the enemy!  It is in my opinion the reason so many Americans are FAT! Sugar is not food, it has no nutritional value. Sugar is processed - extracted from foods and in this unnatural state is dangerous but ohh so delicious and addictive.  Food companies know this all too well. This is why sugar is in almost everything.

I myself have taken the advice but made some changes, keeping chicken and fish in my diet.  I have lost 35 pounds on my way to losing 60 lbs. Its been very easy.  If I were diabetic or pre-diabetic, I would go vegan as the Dr. recommends.

So if you are diabetic, fat or have or worried about heart disease - or know someone with these problems, you must watch this show and change your eating habits. Take Dr. Bernard's advice and save your life or the life of someone you care about.",1287360000,10,1533,4.494584837545126

I read the book that goes with this dvd, and watched the entire dvd several times. I will not be adhering to the vegan lifestyle that Dr Barnard recommends, due to its extremely high amounts of carbohydrates ( I am very carb sensitive ), as doing so would cause me to use high dosages of insulin.

However, I did find lots of useful information in this presentation, and have adopted several meal/recipe suggestions.

 As diabetes is the only disease that can be controlled, I am always on the look out for new and effective techniques to incorporate into my lifestyle. For this reason, I will recommend this product to others.

My husband has diabetes, and when he follows this diet, he can maintain his blood sugar at a much lower number, and his ANC hovers around 5.  When he starts increasing his fat consumption (we've been vegans for years, so flesh is never an issue), his blood sugar again goes out of control.  Some of the cruel facts are that diabetes is a killer and the longer you have it the less effective the medications become.  This new book has some tasty recipes that make staying on the diet a lot easier.  We hope that it has bought my husband several more years.
