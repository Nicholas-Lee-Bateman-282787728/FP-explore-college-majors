7978109,4,B00007L4O3,"Bought it to replace worn out vhs. The dvd is fine. The plastic package for the dvd was cheap and broken. Dvd was loose inside of it during shipping, but the tiny scratch is almost invisible, and did not affect playback.",1370217600,,220,4.390243902439025
7978110,5,B00007L4O3,"I started getting my daughter in Hello Kitty via Youtube to see if she would like it since we don't cable/ Dish/ Netflix to watch things at the moment. This DVD is filled with mini stories of Kitty and Mimi (her twin sister) White experiences and in between episodes is little games such as what animal is it as they reveal a corner with an additional hint, mixing colors, and what is the object.

This is a very cute movie with great stories and life lessons sprinkled throughout and would highly recommend to anyone into the Sanrio universe.",1359331200,2,543,4.540816326530612
7978111,3,B00007L4O3,"Hello Kitty's Paradise: Share & Care is the third volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty's Paradise.  The back of the box claims there are eight complete episodes included.  However, the box doesn't explicitly state that the episodes are roughly ten to eleven minutes in length; two ""episodes"" actually make up one whole episode of Hello Kitty's Paradise.  In between the stories, and sometimes at the beginning or at the end of the show, there is a ""Fun and Games"" section using claymation.  On this disc, only two types of games are included: ""Animals! Animals!"" and ""Kitty's Caterpillar Quiz.""  Personally, I didn't care much for the ""Fun and Games"" pieces.  I didn't think they were very well-produced, although my 4-year-old daughter enjoyed them (she enjoyed trying to guess the animals).

The episodes included on this disc are: ""Shadow Play,"" ""Happy Birthday Papa,"" ""The Great Kitty Car Race,"" ""Adventures in Groceryland,"" ""A Trip to Rainbow Park,"" ""Birthday Party Time,"" ""Making Cookies,"" and ""Great Shapes!""  The episodes either encourage children to use their imaginations or work to teach kids important lessons about life.  On this disc, life lessons include minding manners, caring and sharing.  As a parent, I appreciated that the English dub versions of the stories included on this DVD provided positive messages for their intended audience.  I also appreciate that the English dubs of the actual stories were written in a way that the episodes didn't talk down to the audience.  My 4-year-old daughter enjoyed watching this DVD, and seems to enjoy the cute animation, the bright colors, and the stories.

Admittedly, this is a ""low frills"" DVD release.  The main menu has options for Scene Selection and  DVD Credits.  The DVD Credits is a screen which shows who worked on this Hello Kitty DVD release.

The Hello Kitty's Paradise DVD releases contain anime that's very friendly to young children.  However, girls will probably be more interested in these DVDs than boys, due to the ""cuteness"" of Hello Kitty.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty's Paradise DVDs.",1255996800,,2159,5.082386363636363
