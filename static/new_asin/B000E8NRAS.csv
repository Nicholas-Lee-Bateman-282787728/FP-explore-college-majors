2510073,4,B000E8NRAS,How to Murder a Millionaire is not a great movie but it's not a bad one either.  It's a fun little movie to watch with some good laughs.  I know Joan Rivers can be irritating at times but she's not so bad in this.  I especially liked the scene in the salon when she is getting her legs waxed.,1254441600,7,292,3.9152542372881354
2510074,5,B000E8NRAS,"The first time I happened to tune into this 1990 TV-made movie I just couldn't stop myself laughing. It's a zany comedy whereby Beverly Hills housewife Irma Summers (Joan Rivers) mistakenly believes her husband is trying to murder her. Wacky, far-out situations follow.

I have waited for years for this film to be released on DVD and thought today I'd check to see if it had appeared on amazon. Shock of shocks it is finally is out! ONE OF JOAN'S BEST ACTING ROLES!",1201305600,14,466,4.614457831325301

8107400,5,B000E8NRAS,I never heard of this movie but I love Joan Rivers so I decided to buy it on a whim.  I am SO glad I did!  This movie is hysterical!!!  I like early 90's comedy movies as they aren't as crass as the shi* nowadays.  Highly recommend!  this is also pretty hard to find so you might want to snap it up before they jack up the prices.,1445472000,,330,3.7941176470588234
