I was so excited when I saw the Amazon ad with no warning that it's in the PAL format.  This Blu-ray disk does not play on my Blu-ray player, so beware of this if you plan to buy this disk.  This film and ""Gold of Naples"" should be released for the USA audience.  These two classics deserve a top grade release by Criterion or some other quality group.",1481673600,,452,4.044943820224719
