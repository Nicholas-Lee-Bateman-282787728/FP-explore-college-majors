8749112,4,B01B2KY2BE,Its not a bad supplement to other training instruction. That being said it is all in French with English subtitles available. Like most martial arts videos I've seen its not the highest quality production and it only gives overviews of techniques. It is not structured like a class or a workout video. Also this is just a combination of two dvds that are sold as singles elseware on amazon. The dvds cover Hapkido on one disc and TaeKwonDo on the other.,1509148800,,453,4.604938271604938
8749113,1,B01B2KY2BE,This is another non playable in any of the 5 DVD players I have or 2-PS3's or 1-PS4.  I would not be giving any stars but you have to put one that's how Amazon works.,1502582400,,166,3.742857142857143
