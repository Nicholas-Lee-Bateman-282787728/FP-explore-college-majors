The programs within the dvd are relevant and interesting, the only criticism is that the chapters are a little confusing - they aren't listed as they appear in order on the dvd, but you have the chance to view segments by gardens.

3053647,5,B0010X5JBG,"This is a truly inspirational DVD set.  I had never heard of Penelope Hobhouse, but now understand the reason for her fame.

Not only was I able to feast my eyes on dozens of beautiful gardens, but I learnt a wealth of information.  The presenter is very engaging and her love and passion for plants and gardening is infectious.  It is assumed that most of the viewers are in North America, which was useful to me; Ms. Hobhouse demonstrated how the designs of the English garden, the styles of gardens in America with the plants and conditions that we have here can all be combined to create a beautiful landscape wherever you happen to be.  Her interviews with experts in Europe and the States are also very informative.  I can't wait to watch the entire DVD set all over again.",1313020800,10,779,4.5285714285714285

8239101,5,B0010X5JBG,"The most informative video you will ever see on gardening.  You may be board out of your skull; but you will watch again and again, because you will never ever get this much precious information from any other source.  In this series, Penelope Hobhouse takes us to visit some of the most important people in gardening today and we are afforded the opportunity to view their beautiful gardens as if we were there in person.  The Art and Practice of Gardening will always have a place in my garden library.",1523232000,,504,4.5777777777777775

8239108,5,B0010X5JBG,"I really enjoy putting in these discs and watching all the beautiful gardens she explores.  I have gotten some terrific ideas and new plant inspirations for my own garden.  I just wish there were more newer videos out there to choose from. I guess no one thinks there's an interest, but when it's cold or rainy outside and I can't get into my own garden, I pop one of these in the player and dream of making my own garden as splendid as these experts.",1426464000,2,451,4.294117647058823
8239109,5,B0010X5JBG,I'm an avid gardener and master gardener for my county. I love plants and flowers and listening to Penelope go through various garden designs is very inspirational.

8239110,5,B0010X5JBG,"I owned this series on VHS tape and watched it for years. I was thrilled to find it on DVD. Penelope Hobhouse is lovely, perfectly English and a wealth of information. The gardens are beautiful and I use inspiration from them in creating my own cottage style garden. Put one of these DVDs into your player and be whisked away on a comforting, magical journey. Second only to Audrey Hepburn's, Gardens of the World, which features Penelope Hobhouse as well.",1404864000,,456,4.7125
