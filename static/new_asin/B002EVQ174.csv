3919617,4,B002EVQ174,"If you like comic books turned to movies you'll like this.  X-Men Orgins Wolverine is the best of the 4 in my opinion, action scenes are better, but the trilogy pack has a better storyline.  Wolverine's flashbacks in the Trilogy series isn't exactly like Orgins, but its close enough to work.  This is a set where if you are good at picking up on little things, why the people are how they are is explained.  There is some comedy thrown in through out also, like when Wolverine complains about there black suits and Cyclops says ""would you rather it be yellow spandex?""  Not the best movies ever but pretty good.",1256083200,3,612,4.527272727272727
3919618,5,B002EVQ174,Great movies and the HD quality makes them even better! What a deal for the set! Amazon rocks!,1255478400,,94,4.277777777777778
3919619,5,B002EVQ174,"Great Price!  The picture great! It was the first time I had ever watched any of the movies.  Starting with Wolverine, I watched them all in order, I loved them all!  Great buy!",1255478400,2,177,4.303030303030303
3919620,4,B002EVQ174,"In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed named Stryker to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a ""cure"" is found that makes all mutants human.

Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the ""cure"" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.

All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films (unless you're watching all of the movies in one sitting!). New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. Acting is 5-Stars. Movies are 5-stars.

Then along comes X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This movie, while entertaining, didn't live up to the excellent standard set by the first 3 movies. It was cool to see Wolverine's origins and all, but I sure hope that they don't take the franchise down an origins path for all of the other X-men characters. I see on IMDB that there's already a plan for Wolverine Origins 2. I'm not excited. In fact I'm bummed that the plan isn't for another X-men movie as of today.

If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) this set is a great opportunity to see the 3 original classic tales in chronological order and to own a kind of bonus movie. Wolverine Origins is totally worth a viewing...the others are keepers and classics in the genre.",1254700800,,1667,4.546666666666667
3919621,5,B002EVQ174,"I got this for myself, it was all four of the x-men movies, and was surprised that they all come with the digital copy, I was happy just to pay the price for the blu-ray movies themselves.
I watched the first movie last night and it turned out great, picture was fantastic.

For the price amazon is selling this bundle for, I would say it is well worth it for any fan.
I watched them on a PS3 which is probably why I didn't have any issues with playing the disks, the PS3 normally gets the  most up to date firmware; as it's always connected to the network.",1253836800,,557,4.148148148148148
3919622,3,B002EVQ174,"Look. I'll start off by saying I have no issues with the product. I think both the trilogy and x-men: orgins look great and play fine on my player. However I was disappointed, because, after buying this from amazon, I opened my X-men trilogy on blu-ray, only to find out it was previously opened/viewed. I saw orange stickers on x-men: the last stand, and upon looking at the discs, I noticed a few fingerprints on them. Now, the discs played fine, no issues, and the digital copies came out fine too. I Just think that if amazon is going to send you a used product, they should note it in the product description. When I buy a new product, I expect it to be new.",1253664000,2,663,4.312
3919623,2,B002EVQ174,"I received my Blu-ray copies of the X-Men Trilogy and X-Men Origins: Wolverine yesterday and was immediately disappointed and frustrated by two things.

1.) I cannot get X-Men Origins: Wolverine to play beyond the ""If you are having trouble..."" screen without turning off the BD-Live functionality on my player (Oppo BD-83). I thought to do this because the other movies in this series all asked if I wanted to download a BD-Live update at that exact point. Maybe it's because the servers are being overwhelmed by a new release, but that shouldn't be the case if proper planning and testing had taken place.

2.) The picture quality of these movies is very poor. Even during the first few scenes of the trilogy movies, there is very noticeable video noise in darker portions of the picture, resembling what you get on a cheap digital still camera with the ISO cranked way up. I know this isn't my player or TV's problem because watching 17 Again, Bolt and S.W.A.T. on the exact same setup yielded SPECTACULAR picture quality. It's almost as if the producers took one of their DVDs and did some cheesey upconversion to create these Blu-ray copies.

I am very tempted to return the whole purchase and just buy them on DVD, saving the extra money I spent to get them on Blu-ray.",1253059200,30,1275,4.708520179372197

8368351,5,B002EVQ174,"I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-Blu-ray/dp/B000ICLRIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four [Blu-ray</a>], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.",1274054400,,830,6.102564102564102
8368352,5,B002EVQ174,Seeing these movies in Blu-ray format for the first time I was blown away at all the little details that I missed in the past. Since I got them at a bundle price from Amazon it made it all the sweeter!!!,1269129600,,203,3.975609756097561
8368353,5,B002EVQ174,All i got to say is i am very happy with this combo i bought. The graphics and the special effects i don't think i will ever get bored of especially on a 52inch 1080p hdtv. I have Been a big xmen fan since i was a kid in  all i can say is i don't think i will ever get tired of it. What i also liked from these blu-rays is that they all come with digital copys to download to your ipods or computers wich i did with my laptop so i can watch if im out and about. I just really hope theres gonna be more xmen movies to come.,1266796800,,522,3.6194690265486726
8368354,5,B002EVQ174,"I am a fan of the X Men movies, and had to get the Origins one. It was nice to see them offer it in a set with the other X Men movies in Blu Ray. Great way to quickly update your collection at a reasonable price.",1263081600,,212,3.5319148936170213

8368357,5,B002EVQ174,"I have a view on when to and when not to buy blu-rays.  Unless it has action and is a very intense movie with lots of effects and sounds, I just go with the standard DVD.  So knowing that this would fall into the category of a blu-ray buy, I bought the trilogy and the new Wolverine.  Well Worth it!!!  The graphics were fantastic and the audio was perfect.  The movies were great as well, but if you're reading this you're already convinced to buy the movies, you're just deciding if it's worth the blu-ray price.  I would say if you're watching it on a standard definition (or even a HD) set that is less than 30""-36"" then it really doesn't matter all that much.  If your going big (I'm on a 63"") then definitely go with the blu-ray, no questions.  Hope that helps.",1256169600,5,767,4.277777777777778
