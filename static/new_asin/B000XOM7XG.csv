8228901,4,B000XOM7XG,Ringling Brothers promo DVD from the 133rd year. Mostly clips from various performances. I love the circus so like to watch this. It's also good for children and seniors with memory issues because it's lively but not too long.,1371427200,3,226,4.82051282051282
8228902,5,B000XOM7XG,I purchased this for a younger age than it was intended for.  They were fidgety but that was my fault.  Fun video for 7 and up children.,1344211200,2,136,4.0
