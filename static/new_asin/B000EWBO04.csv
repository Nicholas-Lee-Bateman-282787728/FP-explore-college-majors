8115124,4,B000EWBO04,"Le monache di Sant'Arcangelo ( NUN OF SAINT ARCHANGEL - Domenico
Paolella, 1973) draws an audience today in part from Ornella Muti
having a tailor-made short appearance,  as she once again
reflects ""the people"" vs. the establishment, as she so often does
in the movies.

From a cinematographical point of view, the professionalism is
outstanding, in terms of  technique,  wide screen release,
focused images, story, and script (albeit somewhat minimal). It's
also not puritan, as there is gratuituous nudity, which is
somehow appropriate in the context of various torture techniques
employed in the inquisitorial proceedings.

The microcosm of such a Nun environment, closed in itself,
creates a world in itself. The youths in it, may naturally be
inclined to seek experiences, culture, meaningful relationships
resulting in breaches in conduct, whether it be in lesbianism
(from the absence of men in the Nunnery) or in secret visits by
outside male lovers.

The movie is successful in demonstrating etiquette, structured
authority, mannerisms, how power interests maneuver behind the
scenes for outcomes they desire, (Head Nun  position), while at
the same time, noblemen obtain young nubiles for marriage,
despite resistance, and having their own lovers.

The seriousness of the Church, its reputation, the rigor of
monitoring and regulating moral conduct is evident, in face of a
dark world, difficult to comprehend, still reeling from the many
mysteries of the past, including the Black Plague that at one
time, wiped out entire populations and lands for lack of sanitary
installations, etc. Prayers, candles, rituals, are essential, as
people are what they practice in day-to-day gestures.

Surprisingly, several times the movie indulges in attacks on the
Nun leadership, by suggesting they sometimes would invade the
intimacy or privacy of the vulnerable members,  condemn them to
solitary confinement, or poisoned potential rivals, etc.

The entire organization becomes the target of an inquisition,
when a misguided member, frustrated by unrequited love becomes a
whistle-blower on the most secret events occuring inside. At the
same time, self inflicted punishment, through bleeding and pain,
is an accepted practice.

In that environment, books are prohibited, personal diaries a
hazard to one's life, renouncing Nun's vows to escape is denied,
intimate relations carry a penalty of  a life sentence, while
thoughts and lusts and excesses 10 years in prison, from the
hooded jurors.

Based in part on the book of Marachi, and events of 1577, it
suggests that facilitism, leveraging of power and influence
occurred by some Spanish noblemen stemming from the gold reserves
arrived from South America/New World. Some gold was donated to
various  organizations in Naples, Sicily for example, comprising
Monasteries, Nunneries, and also Spanish military too, to
preserve the authority of some territories, now Italy.

Overall, the story reflects bruised egos when the Spanish
conquered the New World, became rich, and gained influence in
Europe, next to the Pope, and among the noblemen. It also shows
that scandal can eliminate entire organizations, when they lose
their low, all the while the notes behaviors may be present in
other organizations, elsewhere.",1241136000,9,3266,5.4760956175298805
