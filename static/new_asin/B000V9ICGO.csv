2934005,5,B000V9ICGO,"This DVD is a special Christmas episode of ""The Captain and Tennille"" ABC-TV weekly variety show that aired only one time in 1976.  This rare show hasn't been seen again anywhere until it was released on DVD in 2007.  Special celebrity guests include Tom Bosley of ""Happy Days"", funnyman Don Knotts, and musical guests the Pointer Sisters, as well as Toni Tennille's three sisters themselves!  This rare find includes a lot of your favorite holiday songs like ""Jingle Bells"", ""O Holy Night"", a take on the Beach Boys' ""Little Saint Nick"", and much more!
Truly a priceless treasure for anyone who grew up in the 1970's when television was fun back then, especially during the Yultide Holiday season.  Invite your family to watch this.  It'll bring back simpler times and happier memories.",1278460800,9,787,4.931818181818182

2934007,5,B000V9ICGO,"I have been a C&T fan since 1975 when first hearing LWKUT on the radio. I remember seeing this show originally air in December of 1976, and it so impressed me that when I re-watched this DVD all over again, all the past memories of watching Toni sing to her six year old niece, Caroline as she request a parakeet for Christmas, and her with her sisters singing ""Little Saint Nick"" and ""Oh, Holy Night"" at the end, it all brought chills. Nothing of today can beat the ""cleanliness"" of the variety specials of the 1970s. The commentary tracks are a lovely added touch. Hearing how Toni is touched by her rendition of ""OH, HOLY NIGHT,"" the tender truths in her voice caused me to cry happily along with her when she spoke of how the song 'got to her.' It's those old special memories of Christmas that we cling to in our psyche, and I'm certain it is also the sentimental value of Christmas that caused Toni's happy tears. This DVD is most definitely worth your money. When I first viewed it in 1976 I never thought I'd ever see it again. I never thought the video recorder.. the ENORMOUS contraptions we had in our schools in the 70's that covered up half of a large room, I never figured they'd one day transpire into common everyday-in-home items that most all Americans own. My fave parts  are the bits when she sings with her sisters, and of course Caroline getting cozy on Toni's lap, where Toni sings a special Christmas carol to her. (I remember being a bit envious of Caroline, wishing I was her niece, although I was WAY too big to be sitting on anyone's lap, I remember thinking how neat it would be to have Toni for my aunt.) Even though the ""Wedding Song"" isn't a Christmas song, it made a lovely added touch to the special. Like God says in the Good Book, without love we are nothing, and without love we have no need for Christmas... thus, it was an appropriate number. I highly recommend this, and all the DVDS (Songbook, Hawaii, New Orleans, as well as their 1976 three box DVD set) to be added to any C&T fan's music and DVD libraries. It is all excellent. I'm ecstatic they've at last released these truly entertaining musical sensations! -Mary Jo Brunette",1196035200,19,2172,4.457286432160804
2934008,5,B000V9ICGO,I had never seen The Captain and Tennille when they were on in the 76-77 television season which was my loss.  I got the Ultimate collection which was terrific so I bought the Christmas special which was colorful and lots of fun.  It is hard to imagine such Talent going into a show these days in 2007!  If you like fun and talented entertainers I highly recommend this DVD.,1192924800,20,374,4.391304347826087

I hope that you can recommend some DVD, with their best hits and without any guest...

I disappointed...

My friends do not want them or gifted.

I hope your comments.",1398470400,,287,4.568627450980392
8217390,5,B000V9ICGO,It is a great quality item.  Very pleased. Was a nice addition to my collection.  I always enjoyed them as a teenager.,1395532800,,118,4.318181818181818
8217391,3,B000V9ICGO,"As far as peeking into a window of the past, this is a lot of fun--an over-the-top cheesefest from 1976. Points also for the commentary, even though the comments drop out for several sketches for some reason.

It looks great and is very well-presented. There were a number of variety shows like this one on the air during this time in American TV history, but this one lasted only one season; the Captain is predictably wooden and Toni Tennille is the featured player throughout. Guest appearances by the Pointer Sisters, Don Knotts and Tom Bosley.

The downside though is that, as a Christmas show, it's a little uneven. Probably half of it or more doesn't have anything to do specifically with the holiday. I like Christmas specials to be thoroughly Christamasy. Just a personal preference; I know that others though share this opinion.",1386288000,,838,4.853146853146853

8217393,4,B000V9ICGO,If you enjoyed watching the Captain and Tennile on television years ago you'll enjoy this Christmas video.  Loved it and it is certainly family friendly.,1357430400,,153,5.12
8217394,1,B000V9ICGO,"After reading glowing reviews on this CD and being a Toni Tennille fan I decided to purchase it.  I watched it yesterday and what a disappointment!  It's lame, lame, lame !  Andy Williams is much better.",1353974400,2,203,4.583333333333333
8217395,4,B000V9ICGO,"The Captain and Tenille were a great musical act... I remember my Mom and Dad tuning into the program back in the 1970s. I don't remember the Christmas special but the music was great. I don't think the ""spontaneous"" humor really suited Don Knotts. Maybe they could have used better comedy writers for the show... maybe it would have stayed on the air longer.

Still, a great Christmas show and well worth watching!",1293235200,,415,4.684931506849315
