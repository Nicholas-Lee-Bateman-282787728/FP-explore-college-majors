2475025,5,B000DN5WT8,This Yomega dvd is fantastic.  It has a ton of tricks and a good variety of different types of them.  This is a great gift for any person of any skill level who is interested in learning how to do yo-yo tricks.,1315872000,6,210,3.9761904761904763
2475026,5,B000DN5WT8,"This is a well made and produced DVD.  It of course, as the title would indicate, yo-yo tricks.  If you want to get the most from your yo-yo, or yo-yos, as the case may be, then this is a wonderful DVD to start with.  Were the cost higher I would suggest that the beginner stick with a small trick book, but as this DVD actually costs less than most of the books I have seen, then it is well worth the money.

The set up on this thing is quite good.  The menu allows the viewer to go from trick to trick with little to no hassle.  Tricks are arranged by skill level and there are indeed over 150 tricks featured and with a bit of imagination a viewer can certainly modify many of these tricks and increase that number by quite a lot.

The product description here probably does not do this DVD justice.  There is a entire and in depth section which is called ""Yo-yo Boot Camp"" which includes some of the best instructions for beginners I have ever seen.  It covers every thing from replacing strings, yo-yo maintenance; the difference is the various types of yo-yos, to simply how to start yo-yoing.  Of course the DVD does push the Yomega line of Yo-yos but that is fine.  The information contained here can apply to any system.  I in particular do not mind this as I am a big fan of Yomega and collect the things....sigh, as long as the money holds out!

Instructions for each and every trick are demonstrated quite clearly and the viewer has the option of either watching the trick being done at full speed or in slow motion. This is most helpful.  The picture quality is extremely good and the young folks performing and teaching are working at a teaching level which belies their obvious young age.  There are tricks on this DVD for all levels from the level of never having had a yo-yo in your hand before, all the way to the most advanced which are performed by professionals for the most part.  All tricks are doable though, you just have to practice, practice, practice.

If you are interested in beginning yo-yoing skills, or wanted to advance your skill level, then this is an ideal DVD.  Keep in mind though that nothing replaces actually doing a trick over and over yourself.  Many of these tricks are quite difficult and even though the instructions are wonderful, it is no something that you are going to be able to do instantly.

Excellent DVD and well worth the money.

2475064,5,B000DN5WT8,I purchased this with my son's first yo yo.  I figured it would help him get the most out of his yo yo.  He loves it and has most of it memorized.
