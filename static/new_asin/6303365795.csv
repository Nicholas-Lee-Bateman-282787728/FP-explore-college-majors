--------------------------------------------------

For those who don't already know, contained on this DVD are stories from the 1987 Saturday morning series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater"".  You wouldn't know that by watching the disc because there are NO SERIES OPENING TITLES and NO SERIES END CREDITS!!!  Yes, you read that correctly.  They left out one of the most significant parts of a television series.  Remember the catchy theme song?  Well, all you'll have are your memories because that theme won't be found here.  There's a credits block on the back of the case that lists the voice actors and major crew, but it doesn't list the minor crew members.  Pity all of the poor animators whose work on the series now goes uncredited.

The series consists of 13 half-hour episodes with 2 stories per episode (26 stories total).  Yet only 25 of the 26 stories appear on these five discs.  Keep in mind that's only 5 stories per each 10.00 disc (that's the original price).  They could have easily fit the entire series onto two dual-layer discs for 20.00.  So not only are you missing a story, and NOT getting the episodes in their original 2-story pairs with the original series opening titles and end credits, but you're being bilked for what little you DO get!

The previous VHS releases in the late 1990s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-of-Paws-VHS/dp/0792838394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard of Paws VHS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitty-The-Beast-VHS/dp/0792838386/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitty & The Beast VHS</a>) were MUCH better than these five DVDs.  Sure they only included four stories each, but they included the series opening titles and end credits, which makes them a vast improvement over these DVDs.  I can only hope that someone at MGM wakes up and re-releases this series as a proper ""complete series"" set, but I doubt that that will ever happen.",1223683200,3,3862,7.4298245614035086
7844426,5,6303365795,"I think you can find yourself enjoying this set with the right mindset.  When I got it I was fearful that it would be too childish, after watching the Spoof on Star Wars, I knew my purchase would be worthwhile.  I haven't watched them all yet, but it brings me back to being younger and in school since it is definitely in the style of the 80's anime you'd find on television back then.

Thumbs up. :)",1223337600,,401,4.181818181818182
