8716220,1,B00XL8D7Y4,This was just a copy of CD and without English subtitle. Very poor quality and late on delivery.,1453334400,,96,4.388888888888889
8716221,5,B00XL8D7Y4,"and that includes much-improved subtitles.  As example, between the beginning and the first appearance of Chiang Kai-Chek, I saw only one ""garble"".

It still has some grammatical errors; and punctuation is virtually non-existent.  But there is no problem understanding any of them.

In addition, there appear to be scenes in this release that are not in the DVD release.  And several additional subtitles provide important clarifications.
