4070320,1,B0035JHYGQ,"It is always a shock when top-flight actors like Russell Crowe get caught in messes like this. I can only imagine the pre-production ideas that must have surrounded this turkey. Crowe plays a kind of (?) retired cop who has a comatose wife that plays absolutely no part in the movie, but is tossed in there anyway to show...  What? Why? There is also a queer notion that the murdering youth's church is solidly behind him, and he continually prays before eating, yet this point is also never developed. When the kid yells ""you have no right to detain me!"" to Crowe, we have to agree with him but this part of the movie (why someone not on the force has these arbitrary powers...?) is never explored either.

When the girl and the guy are driving down the freeway, and the next shot is they are in a totally removed abandoned trailer because the girl ""has to use the bathroom,"" we have to wonder if the production people need more or less drugs to remind them of something called 'continuity.' To make matters worse, Crowe shows up two minutes behind them, when he wasn't even tailing them! Altho he's only twenty yards from two cars, Russell's character cannot hear them drive away either. It's these kinds of sophomoric and egotistical director's choices that make this movie a total clunker.
 Altho we are led to believe the main character's killing of a young girl years before was discovered by his mother and that's why he killed both his parents, this thread is left dangling to an audience that quickly thinks ""who cares?"" The female star is so vapid and annoying that one is hoping the killer will soon dispose of her, but he is also so uninteresting and confused that we wonder where this film is going rather quickly.
The main girl looking to get murdered by this tentative, newly released killer of his parents is also poorly drawn, with some examples of decadence, but for her kinda (?) rape we rely on hearsay. The production never really decides what it is about. If it's supposed to be a girl looking to be a ""prey"" then it's rather poorly written from that point as well.
The fact that the killer doesn't want her to die at the end is also rather non-sequiter as he was ready to kill her earlier. There is simply no ""juice"" in the film that makes you care whether the killer wanted to murder her or not; or deserves to go back to jail for doing so.",1271203200,7,2364,4.493023255813953

4070329,4,B0035JHYGQ,This movie was unexpectedly endearing. It's quite dark and hopeless but has a human aspect that made me feel compassion and tolerance toward both the female and male lead. Russell Crowe is a mere afterthought in this film. The film is definitely a bit off and unhealthy but also lovely and sad.

4070367,3,B0035JHYGQ,"NOTE: THERE MAY BE SOME MINOR SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. I like psychological thrillers. It's one of my favorite genres. This one has the ""psychological"" part down but it needs a lot of work on the ""thriller."" First thing: It's way too long. At least thirty minutes could have been cut without losing any of the nuances. Yes, it takes time to build the relationship between Eric and Lori, but not THAT much time. A few key scenes would have established that. And Russell Crowe's character was just embarrassing. I'm not a fan of his - this is probably only the second movie I've seen with him in it - but for him to play this milquetoast character with the whiny voice goes so much against everything else I've ever seen him play (previews, anyway) that he becomes a laughingstock. And what is his real position with the police department? First he says he's retired, then he says they give him the easy cases. Which is it? He still has a badge, and he wouldn't have that if he was retired. He pretty much stalks Eric after he gets out of jail. If Eric had any smarts, which he obviously doesn't, since his memory seems to be like swiss cheese, he would have taken out a restraining order on Crowe's character, and I have a feeling he would have gotten it. I don't care of Crowe thought Eric would kill again, he had no right to stalk a civilian who had been declared innocent. Yes, Crowe and pretty much everyone else knew Eric was guilty but for whatever reason, he was let go. And Crowe calls Eric a psychopath, but a psychopath would not feel it was necessary to tell the police what happened to Lori, yet Eric does just that, knowing he is taking a huge chance that the police will blame him, which is exactly what they do. This whole story is screwed up. Quite frankly, Crowe's character seems more like a psychopath, or at least a sociopath, than Eric's does. Eric seems to have some kind of mental illness, which rules out psychopathy because that is a personality disorder, not a mental illness. I am being generous by giving this movie three stars, which to me means ""worth watching once."" If you like psychological fiction and you have a lot of patience, it's worth watching once. That's the best I can say about it.",1461888000,,2233,4.462102689486553
4070368,1,B0035JHYGQ,If I could give it zero stars I would. The movie had no purpose. What was Russell Crowe thinking???,1461888000,,99,4.2631578947368425

4070496,3,B0035JHYGQ,"Despite having an interesting premise, director John Polsner and screenwriter Emil Stern's adaptation of Robert Cormier's novel never seems to gain traction and generally fails to rise above its choppy editing and individual sets and sequences. Eric Poole is released from juvenile detention despite being convicted of the brutal murder of his parents. Eric must find a way to reconcile his past and cope with his present while Russell Crowe plays the semi-retired detective that brought him to justice in the past and is determined to keep close tabs on his future. Lori an awkward teenager who has been obsessed with Eric and the murders, desperately pursues interaction between them at all costs.

The character studies of these three individuals never fully materializes on screen nor does it mesh with the attempts at suspense and action. The narrative is driven from the point of view of Crowe's detective character who happens to have smallest of the three roles. Crowe's performance seems flat with no real character development. His slow chase of Eric and Lori and the underlying subplot of his hospitalized wife on life support further confuses the plot and goes nowhere. Eric never brings more than a surface level amount of emotion to any of his scenes. Lori manages to balance her youthful recklessness while still retaining some insight as to what drives her emotionally. An occasionally intense but mostly routine and flat thriller...",1461196800,,1449,5.165957446808511

Alexis Dzenia in her brief role does a great job as unsuspecting near-prey.
Jon Foster brings to the role a truly complicated character. His Eric isn't just the run-of-the-mill serial killer. He weeps, is distraught when Lori is lost.
There are elements of Hitchcock in this film--especially at the carnival.
And I thought of ""An American Tragedy"" (book & film) at the lake.

I am sorry evil exists and we have so many demented troubled individuals to cope with.  And...this film really makes you open your eyes and think. This film is brilliant!

4070762,4,B0035JHYGQ,"Director John Polson is now well known as frequent director on television series such as `Elementary', `Blue Bloods', `The Mentalist',  `The Good Wife', ` Without a Trace' etc. TENDERNESS is an early effort (2009) but the singe is evident. This little film slipped by everyone despite a strong cast - likely because the subject matter is rather difficult to swallow, especially as related by the time flips the picture takes in explaining the story.

Buffalo detective Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), whose catatonic wife is in hospital, takes a special interest in Eric Komenko (an excellent Jon Foster!), a juvenile who killed his parents and will be freed on his 18th birthday. So has Lori Cranston (Sophie Traub), 15 or 16, her body fully developed and the object of lust by her boss and her mother's new boyfriend. She keeps a scrapbook about Eric, and when he's released from custody, she hides in the backseat of his car, insisting he take her with him on a trip toward Albany where he's planning to meet a girl. Cristofuoro is certain Eric will kill again, visits Eric's dead mother's sister Aunt Teresa (Laura Dern, excellent) with whom he lives since his release from Juvenile Hall, agrees with Cristofuoro's intuition and encourages him to pursue Eric in Albany. What happens on the trip to Albany - the disintegration of Eric's fragile sociopathic psyche and Lori's obsession with Eric's none too subtle need to kill leads to a surprising end. It is a film that deals with compulsions on every level and in every character - especially a self-destructive teen obsessed with a murderer, a young man obsessed with killing girls, and a weary detective obsessed with keeping the young man behind bars.

Jon Foster is the center of attention in the story and is supported the excellent work of Russell Crowe and Laura Dern. The supporting cast is strong. Serial killers continue to make an impact on writers, but this story takes a deeper look into the psyche of the main character, if not by words then more by body language.

Here's the scoop. Eric is 18 and getting out of prison, with an expunged record, for killing his parents. He is also the suspect in other murders. Lori hurts inside. She has no father and her mom's boyfriend is about to move in and he has lecherous intentions. Russell Crowe is a semi-retired police lieutenant, with a terribly ill wife, who needs to keep an eye on Eric because he knows Eric is a psychopath and will kill again. Lori forces herself into Eric's life and the two head up to Buffalo where Eric is to hook up with a girl he fleetingly saw in prison.

One of the cool things about this movie is that it isn't a Russell Crowe movie but a movie with Russell Crowe in it. He gets to do his thing without being the alpha male. Then there are the two leads. Jon Foster as Eric, and Sophie Traub as Lori both turn in great performances. The roles they get to play are great themselves. Nearly everything that came out of their mouths was pleasantly unexpected. He seems perfectly normal but certain things trigger a reaction in him that he cannot control. She seems pleasant enough but figures she'll always be runner up. It's as though she feels she doesn't deserve to be happy. The two play off each other well. Crowe has a quiet confidence. He tends to his wife with loving care but doesn't take his eye off the ball where Eric is concerned. Laura Dern plays Eric's aunt. She's good as usual but her part is woefully small.

I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews for this movie. It's difficult to explain just how good this really is. It's a great idea played in a very unexpected manner. I'm thinking more 4 and a half stars than the four I gave it, but maybe it isn't for everyone. But if you're at all into left of center films, give this a shot.",1323993600,2,1925,4.371508379888268

Instead, what *really* takes up the majority of the storyline is this young man (the psychotic killer) who drives around in a car with a 16-year old girl. The girl happened to jump in the back seat without the killer knowing about it (and nearly causing a wreck as you will quickly recover) and the two of them drive around... wherever, trying to figure out where exactly the psychotic killer met this girl before.  She gives him the clues, but he never remembers.  The girl reveals to him her story about a bridge and a river, but apparently he can't remember it no matter what.

There's other interesting moments of suspense, such as the psychotic killer killing his parents and showing only a slightly graphic portion of how it happens.

The storyline, from what I gathered at least, is mainly a neverending list of reflections.  Everything seems to focus on remembering the past, and how the girl and the killer got to this point in their lives, and where they go from here.  This occurs by way of the two of them -like I said above- travelling to forest, bowling alleys, motels, carnivals, etc.

I have mixed feelings about the ending.  I feel somewhat cheated to be honest because I was expecting a satisfying conclusion by way of a moment of terrific suspense, but... without spoiling anything, it's anything but.  I guess the one thing I didn't quite understand is the *very* last scene before the credits rolled.  I get the feeling I missed an important piece of the puzzle there.

4070791,3,B0035JHYGQ,"Russell Crowe plays a cop with no life and a vegetable for a wife. He's obsessed with this young killer who has been released from juveline correction. Jon Foster plays the killer whose emotional life is so damaged he can't connect to human beings in any normal, society approved capacity. Foster's portrayal of his character has an emotional coolness as well as a vulnerability about him, so it's easy to sympathize with him. He resorts back to his ways of thinking and moving around in the world immediately upon gaining his freedom. His aunt, played by Laura Dern, is obviously disturbed to be around him. Foster takes a road trip and meets perhaps the most bizarre character of the film, a young girl played by actress Sophie Traub. She's a strange female character one rarely sees in films like these. Instead of being disturbed by this psychopathic killer, she's in love with him and practically begging to be his victim. Damaged goods they are. Everyone is damaged goods in this film, just like in real life. The story is about taking chances in life as well as getting second chances and still making the same mistakes over and over. It can be depressing but it's honest.

I found the movie involving. It doesn't try to be a conventional thriller or cop on the hunt film. It's obvious that the characters are what's important here and not some cheap thriller elements. The screenplay accomplishes this well and the actors bring their characters to life most vividly. The photography was also well done. Just look at the scene in the woods with Russell Crowe snooping near the abandoned trailer.

The biggest emotion I came away with from this little movie is the title itself, tenderness. The treatment of the tragic nature of this story and it's twisted characters, did not in any way feel exploitive or ham-fisted. It felt tender and remorseful and that's why this small budget, out of the way work will stick in one's memory.",1296345600,19,1936,4.758928571428571

The character of the 15 year old abused and neglected girl is captured remarkably. Her recklessness and her empathy for a boy who has killed his parents are not foreign to girls who are neglected by their mothers and sexually abused their mother's boyfriends.

Maybe this is the type of film that appeals to counselors or people interested in psychological studies. The last few moments reveal profound insights and answer some questions that linger in viewer's mind. I haven't studied the psyche of killers, so I can't comment on it's validity. I just think the film deserves a better rating than the one stars I've seen.

One of the reviews above is from a teacher. I've taught high school, and there's no way I'd show this movie to students. But it goes beyond the fact that they'd be bored with this slow-mover.

4070793,4,B0035JHYGQ,"This movie is set in motion by the release of a young serial killer from prison. His unabated blood lust, obvious to retired police detective Russell Crowe, drives the early scenes. The compulsive nature of his desire to kill makes for some suspect psychology. I'm not sure that's quite the mindset operating in teenage killers. But if you can suspend disbelief for a while, his predatory appraisal of his surroundings fills this film with the muscular tension of an animal about to spring on you.

The scene showing one of his last days in prison is especially effective. A juvenile from the girl's compound mistakenly wanders into the cafeteria where he's cleaning up, and is caught like a deer in the intense, high-beam gaze of the hungry hunter in him. This silent confrontation of predator and prey is brilliant acting.

When another young girl, a sort of convicted killer groupie, attaches herself to the newly independent boy, the film looks a little as if it's going to be another ""Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer"" odyssey. We think the question will be if, or how long, this young innocent with misplaced enthusiasms will survive in the company of such a dangerous character.

However the film ultimately doesn't center on the serial killer himself or on the hazard posed by his impulses. It takes a creative turn and focuses on the groupie, whose attachment turns out to spring from more profound motives than we originally suspected.
There is something about her that we can perhaps all identify with. Beneath her casual bubbliness, she is in despair over the always-ness of her life. Her mother always brings home men focused more on her nubile form than on having any sincere relationship with the more mature woman. The world always disappoints her. Such repetitions bring her to her own dangerous brink.

This is a thoughtful movie, with something else to offer - with something more to offer than the rampages of yet another homicidal maniac.",1295913600,14,1961,4.897590361445783

As one of the world's most popular screen actors, Crowe must see a million scripts. Why would he pick this one?

Perhaps it was Cormier's book, which I haven't read, though coming from the author of I Am The Cheese one imagines it was pretty good. In any case, the movie version of Cormier's novel is strangely weak despite being technically decent. But the whole time I was left thinking, why is Russell Crowe in this tv movie?

It's all a little too overdone, most of all in the absolutely amateurish use of music. Boy oh boy, I hate it when a movie tells me how to feel by suddenly cranking up the scary music. Be scared! Despite nothing on screen indicating that emotion, this music says you should feel it, so go ahead, feel it before you see it. Makes a lot of sense, no? No.

Apart from the hideously obvious music, the acting is fair enough (Crowe is good as always but has little to work with, and his character is quite unprepossessing, all told), and the script is passable. But the whole thing feels like a weird jumble, it's hard to care for any of these characters, there's little suspense despite the constant attempts to manufacture it, and the only thing I really liked was the somewhat twisty ending. So now it makes more sense! But who cares by that point? I got well bored about 40 minutes in and just played my unplugged Strat along with the increasingly hilarious over the top score, always a sign that I've chosen poorly from the local rental barn.

It's all competent enough (excepting the music), but I can't think of any real reasons to recommend this film to anyone but perhaps a young girl obsessed with a psychopath. I'm not sure that audience is reading these reviews, so suffice to say, avoid this Tenderness and instead try a little of Otis Redding's version.

As he confronts and tracks a youthful killer--that Crowe's character is sure will kill again--you wait for crescendo... in vain. The movie broadcasts early that the female sycophant following killer-boy has a personal agenda. It's not difficult to know what that is. Yet the viewer continually hopes for something more than the obvious and mundane. It's not coming. An uninteresting youthful killer walking around with thinly veiled homicidal desires and the stereotypical God persecution complex only make the movie duller. One dead, two dying.

If you're looking for an exciting crime drama, this may not be for you.  If you're looking for something more in the way of a subtle psychological thriller, Tenderness is better than most Redbox flicks.  Rent it once before deciding if you want to buy the DVD.",1271635200,26,1601,4.791970802919708
4070812,3,B0035JHYGQ,"I bought this DVD/film ONLY because I am a fan of Russell's.
And, after watching it that would be the only reason to watch it.

He does his usual great job with a performance.  BUT, we could have done without the moustache.  Yuck.

Now, let's get to the story.

It did NOT make sense as you watched it.  What was going on?  Plot holes the size of boulders in this.

So, the teenage murderer gets out of jail & he's crazy.  Among his victims were his parents YET he goes to live with his aunt Laura Dern from Jurassic Park 1 & 3 after the release.  Makes no sense.

Then, there is a crazy 15/16 year old girl who was already a stalker to him that lies to her mother & her current boyfriend saying she is spending the weekend at a friend's house to hook up with the released murderer.

Now, Russell's characters wife in in the hospital  WE NEVER LEARN WHY SHE IS THERE.  Would have like to have known that.

He starts following the murderer & the stalker.  More than once he was right near them but did not see OR DID NOT HEAR A CAR START UP??????

Not giving the whole movie away here.  When we get to Russell's character catching up with the murderer & stalker.  The stalker tells him she had permission from her parents to be there.  NOW, BEING A COP DON'T YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE CALLED HER MOTHER TO LEARN NO SHE DID NOT?  So, Russell's character & the other cops who find them let the murderer & the stalker go off together.
The stalker dies & the murderer ends up in jail again.  Hey, did we forget a step here.  HOW ABOUT AN AUTOPSY?  I will not give away why she died but when you do then what I just said about the autopsy will make sense.

Russell's character did NOT have permission from his bosses to be following the murderer & this is spoken of later in the film, so why were all these other cops helping him WITHOUT talking to Russell's bosses first?

The  DVD.  Standard.  Plain jane silver disc.  NO chapter search list.

NOW I AM TALKING TO THE DVD MAKERS.  The DVD comes in 1 of these cheap, cheap, cheap can cause damage plastic cases with the unnecessary holes in it.  I DO NOT KNOW WHO'S IDEA IT WAS TO CREATE THESE THINGS, BUT THEY ARE IDIOTS.  CHEAP, CHEAP.  APPARENTLY SO THE DVD WILL GET DAMAGED & YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER 1.",1271548800,3,2249,4.187353629976581
4070813,3,B0035JHYGQ,"Don't expect it to make any sense until the end. Even then, it feels like it has holes and filler at the same time.

I felt the plot stretched in too many directions and lacked a clear story. I found the characters interesting but ultimately difficult to ""position"" in the story. It felt like a mystery, to be honest, because so much of it doesn't make sense, and it was not suspenseful enough to be considered a suspense movie.

Parts of the movie are shown at the end that explain why certain things happened in the beginning. Fine, but I felt I was trying too hard to imagine what the ""point"" of certain scenes were until the very end. Only at the end does it seem to quickly ""wrap up"" and the characters' previous actions (what you remember...) make more sense.

I found it interesting to watch, but it lacks coherence.",1271289600,15,823,4.437086092715232
4070814,3,B0035JHYGQ,"Set in New York State, the story center's on juvenile murderer, Eric Poole, who at 18 is released from jail having served his sentence for the murder of a young girl. Russell Crowe plays the hard-bitten detective who put him away and who is sure that Poole is a potential serial killer who will re-offend. He makes it his mission to keep Poole under surveillance as he sets off on a seemingly innocent road trip up-state. But all is not as it seems as Poole soon finds himself on the run with a young girl who has become obsessed with him and may or may not have been witness to the first murder. All the professional elements are present: acting, directing, lighting, set design, and even a minimal amount of music.  ""Tenderness"" its a really simple movie about very complex characters. Everyone has their motives, their back story and while the ride is not as fun or well done as it could, it closes pretty well. Recommended for those of you who enjoy slow suspense, character driven thrillers.",1271289600,3,996,4.595505617977528

8389028,4,B0035JHYGQ,"I usually like dark films and this one is very dark. Two young people with deep problems. Since I don't know the background of the boy, I can't say if there was anyway that he could have been helped. I'm sure that Lori's school mates and perhaps a teacher might have felt that she was having a tough time. Certainly her mother was willing to hear Lori say what she wanted to hear.

I'm not convinced that Lori's uncaring mother would not have tried to locate her after a couple of days, but there are many young people out there that are virtually on their own even when living with a parent. Lori's yearning to be loved and cared about enables her to glaze over what she saw at the river and try to find some happiness with a person unable to give any feeling to her.  The ending would have happened one way or another.

I can only hope that a movie like this can remind us to pay attention to the people around us and help if we can.",1526083200,,935,4.154696132596685

The ""psychopath"" killer who is released when he turns 18 does a great job as an actor, and that's about the only good thing here. Laura Dern's role and Russel Crowe's role could have been the saving graces of the film but the film does not tap these resources. Instead it focuses on the girl, Laurie's, odd behavior that made me wish her killed off earlier in the film.  Thank goodness it was a free film on Prime because I'd want my money back if I had paid for it.",1525564800,,555,4.12962962962963

8389034,1,B0035JHYGQ,"Terrible film. I only watched it because of Crowe being in it. It starts out bad and just gets worse. Hard to follow. Too many unexplained flashbacks. (spoiler) It's just about a serial killer kid who gets off easy and goes on the prowl, while an abused girl with a death wish, who watched him kill a girl manages to hook up with him, with the idea he will kill her the same way he did the other girl she watched him kill. All the while a detective (Crowe) watches while the abused girl hangs with him even though she wants him to kill her, she also doesn't mind sticking around while he kills other young girls. Finally the girl takes her own life in front of him (jumps out of a rowboat they are in and can't swim) and he gets nailed for it. Somehow Crowe knows he didn't do it, but wants him behind bars because he knows he's a killer. To make the film even sicker, Crowe has a wife, who is a vegetable, who the killer made fun of. Crowe found it necessary to tell the killer, before he left him to his fate, that his wife said ""Hi"", proving she wasn't a vegetable, even though she was. The film is chock full of perverts, pedophiles and predators. Instead of being a cautionary tale, it seems to promote that behavior and show that it's something young girls are attracted to.",1524009600,,1280,4.25
