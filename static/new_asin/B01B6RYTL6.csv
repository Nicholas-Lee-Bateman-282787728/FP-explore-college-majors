8749398,5,B01B6RYTL6,"Set in Toronto, around the turn of the 1900s, this series follows the story of a Toronto detective, Murdock, as well as his cohorts.
It features famous persons, such as A. Conan Doyle, Tesla, etc. making ""cameo"" appearances and also comes up with inventions from about that period.
There is some humor, as well as mystery and interesting characters. There is also a touch of romance.
A super series that I recommend highly, but a word of warning, the scenes set in the morgue are traffic.",1503705600,,488,4.686046511627907
