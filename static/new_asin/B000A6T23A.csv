2367587,4,B000A6T23A,"I have to say I'm a little surprised by the negative reviews on this program... No, it's not just a collection of SNL skits -- as those are readily available on other collections and in reruns.

But this was, at least to me, a rather engrossing little special (originally airing in Feb. 2005 to commemorate the show's 30th upcoming anniversary) that did a nice job of trying to capture the flavor of the era when SNL was first getting off the ground in the mid-to-late '70s.

Maybe I'm just be overly sentimental in that I remember the period and the show's start, but I felt this was worth the watch and worth having as a decent piece of retrospective memorabilia, at least.",1127606400,22,675,4.524590163934426
2367588,1,B000A6T23A,"How is it that all the other SNL dvd's have comedic clips and this one is a documentary?  And its not even funny!  This is just to cash in on the success of the individual performer dvd's.  The dvd is actually 2 documentaries, and neither are really worth watching since they are the same thing really.  I think they had two runner's up and just put both on the disc.

The remaining members of the original cast and crew  talk a little bit about what it was like doing the show or what it was like working with comedian 'X'...

Save your money, or if you must have this, buy mine please.",1126828800,113,587,4.1875
2367589,1,B000A6T23A,"Blah blah blah blah blah. That is what this DVD is. If I wanted to hear Lorne Michael's spiel again I would have listened to the other 10,000 ""We had it rough at first-- Nobody had faith in us"" interviews before it. I expected some of the best scenes from the first five years of SNL. What I got was a mish mash of people who like to hear themselves talk. And the scenes they did do, they didn't even finish. DON'T waste your money. The individual actor's DVDs, such as The Best of Will Ferrel and The Best of Dana Carvey etc..., are MUCH better. If they are planning on doing a series of these, such as 6-10, 11-15, etc... they need to rethink it.",1126742400,10,648,4.150793650793651
2367590,1,B000A6T23A,"While there are some good highlights from the first five years, this DVD is a really long documentary more interested in glorifying the self-righteous cast members than giving us the clips which made the show great.  Definitely not worth buying.",1126051200,28,245,5.125
2367591,2,B000A6T23A,"This DVD is a documentary special about the cast and crew from those years, and while it is interesting, it is still the same thing you already got if you read ""Live From New York."" All in all it is okay but I was expecting a standard SNL DVD full of the old skits. That's what I plunked my $ down for. Not for this. So if you're looking to buy this for sketches, beware. On a lighter note, the Best of Aykroyd is perfection.",1126051200,216,425,4.011764705882353

2367623,1,B000A6T23A,"The first hint that this DVD is a rip-off is that it's ONE DVD, promoted as ""The first 5 years"". Hello! I missed the obvious fact that even one year would require more than one disk. Don't bother, unless you like documentaries about TV shows. There is no particular rhyme or reason, no sequence, no continuity. I vote zero stars.",1394755200,,329,4.5
2367624,5,B000A6T23A,I wan't alive for the first 20 something years of SNL but i really enjoy watching this because i know where my favorite show started in 1975. It is great and i personally enjoyed it.,1388448000,,182,4.228571428571429

Or, spend the money and buy the complete episodes which happen to now be available for the first 5 years. This has got to be one of the best documentaries of a legendary show, ever.",1276646400,4,274,4.0
2367628,5,B000A6T23A,"When ""Saturday Night Live"" premiered in October 1975,I was a junior in high school-The show was definitely must-see TV at that time-It was nice to see most of the original cast members from that period (ie:Chevy Chase,Laraine Newman,Dan Akyroyd,& Garrett Morris) offer their thoughts on what it was like to work on a show that was truly cutting edge.
""Saturday Night Live-The First Five Years"" is highly recommended for those who love great comedy-Believe me,you won't be disappointed.",1255046400,3,485,5.230769230769231
2367629,1,B000A6T23A,"The NBC Universal Store is having a web special - five items for $20.

So I ordered this for $4 and it is considerably overpriced.  I wish I'd read the Amazon reviews first!

The essence of television is telling the story through pictures - ""vision.""  The best way to show that the first five years of SNL would be to compile the best skits and sketches.

Instead, we have some cast members, writers, and Lorne M. (again, and again, and again - but he appears to have written and produced this, so no surprise there - and again) telling us what a great, wonderful, world-changing (no kidding!) show SNL was.

Apparently these good people never watched the Smothers Brothers, but that's another topic for another day.

Give this one a miss!  It's terrible, self-indulgent, and worthless!",1249257600,,786,4.727941176470588
2367630,2,B000A6T23A,"How about making 'Best Of' Saturday Night Live by year?  Not by host, not something with interviews and commentary, just best skits only and by year.  Best of 1978, Best Of 1986, Best Of 1994, etc...",1182556800,4,199,4.5
2367631,2,B000A6T23A,"I was looking forward to a trip down memory lane with all the best skits from the first 5 years of SNL. Instead, with this DVD, I got lots of commentary and background information, with only  a few skits. The skits shown weren't even available in their entirety, which was frustrating. So, I ended up feeling that this DVD was not worth the money, did not at all provide me with what I thought I was getting based on its title.",1168819200,13,427,4.271604938271605
2367669,2,B000A6T23A,"Unfortunately, there is no real substance to this documentary.  Though a few of the interviews are interesting, all are cursory at best.  You're not seeing full skits and there is no criticism to speak of.  I give SNL The First 5 Years 2 stars, as it's ideal for a foreign exchange film student who never heard of or saw Saturday Night Live. Save your money and watch the gazillion re-reruns.",1162857600,12,392,4.571428571428571
2367670,4,B000A6T23A,"This is not a ""Best of"" compilation and does not claim to be.  But it is a must-see for any Saturday Night Live fan.  It's an amazing inside look at the birth of this landmark show.  Through interviews, hilarious clips, and musical performances, take a journey through the early days of SNL.  Those who were around to watch in 1975 will relive some classic moments and get some behind-the-scenes insight into the struggle to get them on the air in the first place.  And those who are new to the original cast will never see the current SNL the same way again.  It pales in comparison.",1151020800,22,584,4.462264150943396
2367671,5,B000A6T23A,"Like some reviewers I was expecting only classic SNL skits from 1975-1980. Instead this dvd is a documentary about the first five years with interviews from the original cast and people who hosted the show, along with excerpts from many skits. But I am not going to complain like the knuckleheads who buy a dvd from the Classic Albums series and say ""Where are the music videos!?"". I enjoyed the interviews with Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, etc. about what was going on around the show. I discovered some things about SNL that I never knew. At 2 1/2 hours it's a good deal. I just wish it were twice as long.",1145836800,25,606,4.468468468468468
2367672,1,B000A6T23A,"If everyone would stop buying these loser collections by player or anniversary clips with no ""live"" feeling going from bit to bit, then MAYBE they will release these shows the way they are suppose to be viewed... uncut by season.

2367673,2,B000A6T23A,"It sounds as if you're getting a ""Best of..."" deal with all the skits you'd expect to see.  However, this DVD is mostly documentary with only small skit portions thrown in.  Buy it if you're into history, not comedy...",1139875200,15,218,4.564102564102564
2367674,1,B000A6T23A,"I usually read reviews before I buy stuff on Amazon, but for some reason I didn't this time and boy, was that a mistake!

Since purchasing this DVD and being sorely disappointed that there was not ONE sketch presented in its entirety, I went back to read the other reviews and they are all right on the money!  This DVD is grossly mis-represented as classic sketches from the first 5 years of SNL and it is NOTHING like that.  It is simply a documentary about the first five years with lots of interviews from various people involved (cast members, producers, hosts, etc).  The only time I found myself laughing or enjoying myself was when there was a short clip of a sketch.  Yes, that's right, a SHORT clip.  There was not ONE sketch showed in its entirety.  And even the short clips were few and far between.

I am sorry that I can't return this DVD and since it sucks so bad, I'm guessing that I won't be able to sell it used either.  So I am stuck with it.  But let that be a lesson to all of us consumers out there:  READ REVIEWS when they are available.  The corporate world is trying to stick it to us whenever they can so we have to watch out for each other!

Do NOT buy this DVD!!!!  It is a RIP OFF!!!!",1135987200,66,1213,4.194805194805195

Why the hell Michaels, NBC, or whomever else has the rights to those years doesn't put out those full episodes is beyond me.

In fact, it's a full-on travesty!
