8117751,1,B000F5EEY8,My Sylvania DVD player will NOT play this DVD.  I have seen this movie years ago and was very happy with the film.  I only wished that my recorder could play it.,1503619200,,161,4.0
8117752,4,B000F5EEY8,"Actually, I liked this movie so much I contrived to buy A region 4 and USA/Canada one at the same time.
The region 1 came first.
Excellent print and transfer, good sound. Typical muddy look for pommie movies of the day. 1967 England was grim.

Cook and Moore were worthy links between the Goons and the groups that eventually morphed into Monty Python. I agree with the reviewer who commented on their tendency to over-do some gags, both in their TV shows, and on film, but, interspersed were some priceless comic moments.

Moore here is a suitably bemused no-body, and Cook a wonderful Devil. Their take on  Faust and the relationship between God and Devil was not new, but even now has a certain freshness in its presentation.
Eleanor Bron is a great foil to the bumbling Harry Moon.

Raquel Welch seems hopelessly out of place as Lust...but as a parody of herself, perhaps was a good call. Of the other sins, Barry Humpries is a suitably snide Envy, the other Sins not so convincing, though none get a fair go.
Very much Cook and Moore.
I haven't opened the Aust disc, as my American one plays perfectly well.
So, if anyone wants a region 4 version...it remains pristine",1405814400,,1173,4.598086124401914
8117753,5,B000F5EEY8,"Sooo much better than the Brendan Fraser remake! Dudley Moore and Peter Cooke at their best. This film was criticized at the time for being anti-religious, when in fact it fairly strongly reinforces established Christian themes and morals. The puns and sight gags are delightful, and the whole story has just the right touch of innocence and irreverence.

Definitely a classic.",1170201600,3,377,5.180327868852459
8117754,4,B000F5EEY8,"This Mephistophelean comedy is easily the best of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's big screen pairings, and far more successful than the Brendan Fraser remake (although the absence of Elizabeth Hurley guarantees that on its own), but it is somewhat inconsistent in tone. It's the set-up and linking scenes that are the funniest and cleverest by far, as Peter Cook's George Spiggott (aka the Devil) explains the various theological conundrums of the whole Good-and-Evil-and-Free-Choice thing to Dudley Moore's short-order hamburger chef Stanley Moon while going about his daily business of mundane petty sins and mischief - fixing parking meters, scratching records, cutting buttons off shirts, drilling holes in oil tankers, persuading pigeons to crap on passers by - with little help from his useless assistants (""What terrible sins I've got working for me. Must be the wages.""). Most of the mysteries of the ages are explained: the Garden of Eden is revealed as a boggy swamp just south of Croydon, Heaven turns out to be the garden center at Syon Park in Brentford, God is naturally an Englishman. And the key to success with women turns out to be - ""In the words of Marcel Proust - and this applies to any woman in the world - if you can stay up and listen with a fair degree of attention to whatever garbage, no matter how stupid it is that they're coming out with, til ten minutes past four in the morning... you're in.""

The wishes themselves are mostly slightly disappointing, like the duo's later TV work showing a tendancy toward overlength, although they do offer Eleanor Bron a chance to really shine in several different incarnations of Moon's fantasy woman, and the fly on the wall sketch and the wonderful leaping Nuns of the Berylian Order are strokes of insane genius (Cook's statically disinterested pop star - ""You fill me with inertia"" - is an inspired creation too). And don't forget the magic words - ""Julie An-drews!""

Second Sight's PAL DVD is a good one - a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, a 23-minute interviw with Barry Humphries (who plays Envy in the film) and raw footage of a newsreel interview on set with Cook and Moore.",1155686400,6,2156,4.855978260869565
8117755,5,B000F5EEY8,"One of my favorite films ever and worth the small extra investment in a region free player.  Since my family owns many foreign dvds, we simply purchased a region free dvd player (via Amazon).  Just search Amazon for ""region free dvd player.""  I recommend the Daewoo.  It was super cheap and actually is better than our Toshiba US only player that we paid a lot more for.",1150675200,5,370,4.477611940298507
8117756,5,B000F5EEY8,"The only way you can get your DVD to work is to buy a Region 0 DVD player from the UK. In the future, if the product description says ""Non-USA Format,"" that usually includes San Francisco.",1147132800,,188,4.25
8117757,4,B000F5EEY8,My brand od Dvd Player it cannot play in. My brand is panasonic. Which brand it can play in?,1145836800,,92,3.8947368421052633
8117758,5,B000F5EEY8,"You guys have to see this. It has everything; touching drama,good acting..the entire gamut of what a good viewing experience should be.

For such a good movie which is rated as a drama it had some really funny parts but I won't even begin to ruin those for you.

Meryl is a lonely artist who just lost her father and shortly after that witnessed an accident which resulted in the death of a young man, she also has a work deadline she has to meet, a room she seriously has to clean and a sister who wants her to get a man.

Nick now has just developed testicular cancer and coincidentally was assigned to cover  the aforementioned train acccident with his photographer nick who just got the news that his girlfriend is pregnant a pregnancy which is unplanned.

So far we have Nick,Meryl and Andy WHO's girlfriend is pregnant and decides to have an abortion;however she works with kids and eventually she begins to warm to the idea of having the baby; added to this is the fact that everyone at works reminds her that she doesn't have kids as yet.

Nick forms a bond with Meryl which improves his general condition greatly' all the while he remembers his own father's fight with cancer and the impact it had on his upbringing;this bond between these two central figures shows them both that there is light at the tunnel.

This is dramatic,funny and very good, you guys should see this and the animation sequences makes it even more special and surreal.

Best film I've seen  all year...Sarah Watt you've done a great job here.",1143331200,3,1525,4.556776556776557
