2162184,1,B00062IZS6,The fact that this show still stands proves that America should make like Atlantis and sink!,1124323200,6,92,4.8125
2162185,4,B00062IZS6,"After the first 2 episodes (if you haven't seen this show before, like I hadn't until this DVD First Season Set) there's no way you're going to believe me when I tell you this is a solid, entertaining and stylish show. It's impossible to put your finger on any one bad feature at the start of this series centring on a world of new mutants, because EVERY aspect of their introduction is hideously embarrassing and laughably poor in its execution (Shalimar's pouting being the least of the troubles). Something I must mention though- the special effects that illustrate some of the mutant powers are very poor and funny when they're not supposed to be. Trust me- you'll firmly believe within only a few minutes of the first episode that the only basis for this show is the `X-Men' comics and a group of below average actors who happened to have some spare time between waitressing at Starbucks and auditioning for ketchup commercials (I can't begin to comment on the writing!). But from episode 3 onwards, EVERYTHING comes together and `Mutant X' comes into its own. It's so surprising and actually quite admirable how the producers, actors and writers managed to turn around in a considerably short space of time what could have been an absolute disaster had it continued in that same painful, vein of those initial episodes. From awful to gripping in the blink of an eye, I guarantee and from then on things only get better, episode by episode, consistently excellent in my view until the finale of the season.

Admittedly, even at its height, `Mutant X' remains Saturday afternoon, somewhat forgettable television (although probably a great show for all the family) and so does not come close to the enduring brilliance of shows like `Alias', `Firefly' or `Dark Angel', or to other programmes geared to a somewhat more young-adult and above audience, but there are comparisons to be drawn from those shows. The fight scenes in `Mutant X' (I risk saying) are even better than the fight scenes in `Alias', the exploration of minorities in society and the importance of coming to celebrate everyone's uniqueness is an improvement on the similar issues at the heart of `Dark Angel' and the special effects (even the mutant powers before too long) are incredibly visceral and compliment the action very well and come to rival those of `Firefly'. But what this show in its own right manages impressively and effortlessly is to convey a unique message to its audience in each episode. I would say that redemption is the key to the season as a whole- Mason Eckhart (the baddie) remains the unredeemable character- while all others are neither white nor black, but somewhere in between...even the members of our band of injustice-fighting heroes, which is refreshing.

I was also reminded of cult programmes like `La Femme Nikita' (which shares a producer with M-X) and `Deep Water Black' (named differently in the U.S. I think), but this show has a tone all of its own, which again you'll find hard to believe after the first two episodes, which fail miserably in setting up a convincing world for these gifted characters. Some good points to convince you it's definitely not all bad- the sets and the locations in `Mutant X' are SPECTACULAR, there are twists and turns in many of the stories that you won't see coming and aren't predictable for even the most jaded fan of the genre, and whether a new feature of this DVD or something the show already possessed- it has a slick, stark and quite beautiful look (in one episode I thought I had the martial arts film `Hero' in my DVD machine by mistake- that good people!).

By episode (10), I wanted to write this review to extol the virtues of `Mutant X', but I held off until I'd watched all 22 episodes just in case it took a turn for the worse and descended into the car-crash-horror of the first two introductory episodes, but thankfully it remained enjoyable, fresh, classy television all the way through. An extremely shaky start, but well worth your time and money.

Also...regarding this DVD package...the extras are numerous and appealing- tons of outtakes and the commentaries are great, while the plastic case is cheap but functional and the menus are quite attractive and very easy to use.",1115942400,22,4244,4.825549450549451
2162186,5,B00062IZS6,"season one is very good. it gives you the introduction to a great show. Season two is even better, but that season is very important because it is the last time the orginal team is together. it was a shame that Emma had to die, i loved her. lexa i hate, she is not all that. Season two the complete: on DVD will be a DVD set to remember.",1112745600,5,337,3.898550724637681
2162187,5,B00062IZS6,I love this show it's my favorite show on Saturday afternoon but it's sad that they cancelled this show now I have nothing looking forward too on Saturday afternoon only work but that's it. I love Brennan he's the coolest with his Electricity Powers aka as the Elemental. Then there's Emma but she had left the show in Season 3 her Psyonic powers were cool. Then comes Jesse and that new girl I forgot her name haven't seen the show lately. Then there's Shalimar I like her powers but it's not my favorite out of all these peoples. I can't wait for Season 2 and Season 3 to come out in Box Set because buying it seperate cd's costs alot of money.,1109462400,8,646,4.30327868852459
2162188,5,B00062IZS6,"I have never seen such a great combination of magic, martial arts, pure action, great story lines, and awesome characters all in one series! This is by far my favorite television show!

This a great set! Quality packaging, cast interviews and biographies, character profiles, hilarious outtakes, and behind the scene footage make this a worth-while purchase!

Now that Season 1 is here, I can't wait for Seasons 2 & 3!

I am still keeping the faith that Season 4 will go into production soon! Believe it or not, there is still hope!",1104796800,12,532,4.760869565217392
2162189,1,B00062IZS6,"This looks like a great series, but unfortunatly the packing is horrible. I ordered it, only to get a copy with a loose and scratched disc. A replacement order was sent, but the case was crushed and several discs were loose. This isn't Amazon.com's fault, it is poor packing design by the manufacturer. Don't get this set until that issue has been resolved.",1100217600,12,357,4.682539682539683
2162190,4,B00062IZS6,"I remember this show was pretty good.  I liked X-Men and, though some saw this as a rip off of that franchise, it still was something different.  I kind of wished they'd made them natural mutants like in the Marvel universe.  But then I suppose they wouldn't have had thier super bad villians Genomex.

I was VERY excited to learn that this show was going to be released on dvd.  That was until I found out they were releasing many dvds with a few episodes and a high price to each.  That sucked.  But now I just learned from tvshowsondvd.com that there was a boxed set coming out.  Then I came here to Amazon and found it true!  Yay!  Only forty bucks for this set?  THAT I can handle!  As soon as I have some extra cash, this set will be mine!

Not the best sci-fi show out there.  But it wasn't the worst either.  Sadly this show didn't come back for a fourth year.  Maybe some other station will pick it up.  Look at the shows Sci-Fi Network has picked up and made into hits.  While I'm not a completely dedicated fan to this series (I didn't see every episode and, out of the three seasons I probably saw less than 10% of them) I still would like to see it continue.

My main point is this:  If you are a fan of X-Men or Fantastic Four or Avengers or Teen Titans or Justice League (or any other story where there are super powered humans and things of the like) this show is for you.",1096502400,45,1388,4.146616541353383

2162218,3,B00062IZS6,"This series is fun, empty-minded entertainment - I Love It!! However, I wouldn't say that the series is worth paying much more than $25 for a season. I have had to pay more than I'd like in my efforts to find Season 1 in an undamaged, watchable condition.

The disks arrived rattling around inside the case. The packaging for season 1 and season 3 of Mutant X are the same and Ive never seen
a design like it. There are small plastic arms that hold the bottom of the DVDs in place, they move up and down to snap on the edge of the disk.
Those arms also scratch the disks that rest on top of them, and the disk that its designed to hold in place. They don't work as intended.

The disks were also warped by the notches of plastic that come out of the top edge of the circle, that pinch in and hold the disk in place.
The top title sticker and bottom layer with the DVD information on it, were peeling/bubbling away from the plastic disk.

The packaging for these disks is basically destroying the product. The disks, overall, were not working. Amazon was great about refunding after returning them though.

I have tried ordering them again and I haven't had a chance to watch it. Again, they were rattling around in the case when they arrived and this new order has a pebble or something stuck on the playing surface of a couple of the disks. The new order is from a different companyits just a shame the packaging is so complicated and destructive to the disks themselves. It's not anything a seller can do anything about, it's just annoying as all get out. I don't know who designed them or why they were chosen instead of the simple snap in by the center hole idea that keeps them in place - which is how Season 2 is packaged. No idea why Season 2 is done in the usual packaging that protects the disk.",1454630400,,1804,4.297058823529412

2162226,4,B00062IZS6,"Mutant X was a guilty pleasure when it first came out on late night TV and watching it now on DVD an exercise in nostalgia. It was like so many other shows of the era a Canadian production shot in Vancouver with the seaside cliffs and downtown office towers very much in evidence. This re-issue is as bare-bones as it gets in full-screen TV Aspect with no sub-titles and no supplemental materials.

The well-built stars of the show engage in extremely athletic martial arts fisticuffs in a seemingly invincible fashion. Their double helix and other toys are the stuff of science fiction. Their computer skills are still cutting edge a decade and a half later. The show is one part contact sports, one part soap opera, one part high tech. The ensemble cast seem to enjoy working with each other. The show lasted only three seasons.",1394409600,,830,4.684931506849315
2162237,5,B00062IZS6,"I can't compare ""Mutant-X, The Series"" with the comics, since I never read any of them, however I can relate it to the ""X-Men"" movies.  The Series is, of course, a simpler tale concentrating on character interaction more than special effects and action. Although the Series does have good special effects and action scenes I found the characters more interesting, lacking the perscution-complex and revenge-rage of the movies. Being a fan of Victoria Pratt (Shalimar) I was delighted with her performace as always.  Good science fiction, well presented.  I think you will enjoy it, and maybe gain some insight into the X-Men.",1370995200,,625,5.107843137254902

2162239,4,B00062IZS6,Watched and enjoyed this series years ago. (Who would NOT enjoy watching Victoria Pratt?). Never saw the initial episodes which set up the plot lines.  Good series.

2162243,5,B00062IZS6,"Had no problem's with this season packaging, unlike the 3rd season I got. Which the case packaging I didn't like. Guess there is 2 different style case packaging to this imported Mutant X series. Or could be just who I get it from. This one I got ""Season 1"" came in like the ones you see in US, the small cases, you see now a lot for tv shows. Unlike the 3rd season I got which you open up and there is 3 disc on each side, which for me when I opened it the disc fell out, and some are scratch. Anyways. Glad I got this even tho its imported, happy to have this series in hand. Just wish this one had widescreen like the US version ones had.",1353110400,,641,3.9384615384615387

2162245,4,B00062IZS6,I have a list of dvds that I use when to order if available. I was glad to find Mutant X season one available through Amazon.

All in all this was still worth the experience.,1347235200,,349,4.072463768115942
2162246,5,B00062IZS6,Yes this screams X-Men but of course couldn't say that out right. Great show gone too soon. Of course this comes out after I get the one made in China. If there are special features of this then I would get it.,1329955200,,210,4.023809523809524
2162257,3,B00062IZS6,"Okay, so this is a review of the Canadian import of Mutant X season 1. As far as the transfer goes, everything looks good insofar as picture quality goes. If has both French & English, since it's a Canadian production of the DVDs. Was it a Canadian show to begin with? Not sure. Not interested enough to find out.

So, it follows the misadventures of a group of ""New Mutants"" (were there ""Old Mutants""?? Why aren't they just ""mutants,"" period? One of many questions never answered over the course of the show) headed by an ex-member of GenomeX, a bio-technology company that twiddled with their genetics and accidentally gave them all super powers.

And then there's another guy who is 'evil' and now runs GenomeX as his own private army including mutants and trying to track down and eradicate mutants or put them on ice for future use/testing/etc. Honestly, his acting is so ham-fistedly hammy during this season, he might as well be a cartoon character... It's pretty laughable. He unexplainedly disappears at the start of season 2, as does most reference to GenomeX, until the start of Season 3 where he makes a couple cameos before being summarily killed off. *Shrug*

Really, the whole thing is a giant *shrug* for me. There's little or not overarching story. It's a freak-of-the-week story format. New Mutant with wacky powers shows up and either gets converted to the good guys never to be heard from again or gets offed and is never heard from again. There are no sub-plots, no story arcs, just a bunch of random weekly vignettes... Everyone learns some lesson or another 'bout, you guessed it, 'teamwork' 'trust your friends' 'don't take things out of context,' all the sappy nonsense you'd get out of your typical 80's/90's cartoon series, only... 'Live action.' The action is pretty hammy too. It's the kind of cartoonish action you'd see in Charmed or Buffy. Only without the interesting storylines and ongoing drama.

It doesn't feel like there's ever any character development either. We don't see the characters learn or grow at all throughout the first season, heck hardly even throughout the series.

I was really hoping for more from this show. At least they got rid of some smidge of the hamminess for season 2. But the freak-of-the-week character never really went away and there was still no overarching story. By the time they were vaguely trying to START a story at the end of season 3 it was too late and the show was cancelled on something of a cliff-hanger... Kind of a shame. If they'd made a 4th season it vaguely looked like it MIGHT have started to get interesting? Ohh well.

Honestly, other shows have done better by the teenage crowd looking for their episodic drama: Roswell, Buffy, Angel, Charmed, etc. Mutant X I had high hopes for. I was really hoping for something more X-men like, since it was supposedly from Marvel Studios. The end product was pretty so-so. Sorry guys. Better luck next time.",1329177600,2,2934,4.788537549407114

2162259,5,B00062IZS6,"The First Season was great after season 1 it kinda went off to the left with ghosts, egyptian princesses, magic and ""Sasquatch"".(****SPOILER ALERT**** Then the dirty *astards killed my fave of the girls ,Emma at the start of season 3 (DAMN YOU!!!!!). Heartbroken after the season 3 premiere I stopped watching. I think the tones and feel of the first season were best along with the best stories. No fairies and pixie dust here people season 1 is sci-fi and season 2 is more fantasy based can't comment on season 3. I wished very much they kept with the feel of this season for the series, but writers had to make it more accessible. Too bad the comic one-shots didn't lead to a series, and kept it going in this direction for the comic (like the gi joe cartoon and the comic seperate but the comic was better.). Anyway if you are interested in the series i'd stick with season 1 and maybe 2. But if Emma was your favorite don watch season 3 and pretend she's a-ok and still kickin' ass! Also I think this series has a lot in common , maybe too much in common with the comic series Gen-13. Lots of parallels there. (check out the animated Gen-13 cartoon on youtube and tell me what you think of their simularities (Gen-13 was first).

I already have this box set but one of the discs in it has a skip on it I can NOT get rid of.  So I ordered another one of this box set.  All the discs on it play just fine.  I also have the box sets for seasons 2 and 3.  I say this box set and the box sets for seasons 2 and 3 are worth the time, effort and money it takes to order them.

While the season one foe was constant, he only had 3 lines, was it, that he got to repeat for every episodes.  The Mutant X characters only began to grow as an ensemble and with personalities in the last few episodes.  Perhaps the authors thought action-only would hold the storylines.  There was also much greater possibility for moving the storylines a bit deeper.  Compare this with another sci-fi type show, say ... Angel, there is action, but there is not the care for the characters that Angel had.  I hope that further seasons will reveal better writing and character work.",1140739200,3,701,4.658536585365853
