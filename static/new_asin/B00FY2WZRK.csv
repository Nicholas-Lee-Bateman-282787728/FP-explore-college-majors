8619360,4,B00FY2WZRK,"Excellent Chang Cheh directed movie with a phenomenal cast. Lots of big names in this movie...many go uncredited with small roles in the film. This film is very similar to 36th Chamber of Shaolin (aka Master Killer) with Gordon Liu. But this one came out many years before the 36 Chambers. And this film focuses on a crew of Shaolin monks, as opposed to just one monk. Great training sequences in this movie. The Venoms are even in this film. Definetly a must have if your a fan of kung fu flicks",1405555200,2,496,4.4021739130434785
