6069212,5,B00GB0OWR0,I remember this cartoon from years ago and I'm glad I was able to get this DVD of these episodes. It's something I can continue to see over and over again.,1400112000,,155,4.032258064516129
6069213,3,B00GB0OWR0,I guess 60 minutes of Peabody & Sherman for $10 isn't bad. However I wish they had worked on the film to clean it up and brighten it like I've seen done with other cartoon sets. I found the pictures to be very grainy like they were just thrown on a DVD from an old VCR tape. The shows themselves brought back memories but the cartoons were shorter than I remembered.,1397347200,,366,4.169014084507042

6069216,3,B00GB0OWR0,"It was as good as before .
But all the same cartoons in a row is not the way to see them.
 Should have Rocky and Fractured Fairy Tails along with Dudley Do Right to get in the mood.",1396396800,,181,3.641025641025641
6069217,5,B00GB0OWR0,I reviewed Vol. 1 as well and in that review I indicated that the episode lists of Vol. 1 and 2 are in fact incorrect and are swapped. So the episodes listed for this volume are actually the episodes included in Vol. 1 and vice versa. So beware of that but if you enjoy the content I recommend both volumes anyway.,1396310400,,314,4.163934426229508

8621741,4,B00GB0OWR0,Great nostalgia and content that stands up to and exceeds the material found in most children's cartoons today.  Horrible puns can be forgiven for the crisp dialogue and great story lines provided in almost every chapter.,1465516800,,221,5.138888888888889

8621743,1,B00GB0OWR0,"When inserted in a player, this DVD forces play of previews; it prevents direct access to the menu, skipping a preview or even fast-forwarding through it. I view this as an unacceptable defect.",1432339200,,193,4.878787878787879
