8643121,1,B00IKN0HYI,"If I could give it less than a one, I would. This film is very poorly done.  It wasn't actually a movie.  Instead, the person playing the mature John Newton narrated the story of his life to a young lad.  It felt more like a documentary, but not half as interesting.  It's very slow and quite boring,and not realistic whatsoever  The people they chose to play the parts were poorly cast, in my opinion.  Very dissatisfied with the film. .",1523577600,,438,4.4125
