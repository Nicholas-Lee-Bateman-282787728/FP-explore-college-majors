8290126,5,B001CW801Q,A First class organisation. Truly the best system in the game. When the Wings are on they are poetry. Datsyk is the BEST two way player in the game.,1375315200,,148,4.137931034482759
8290127,5,B001CW801Q,"excellent!!  I think the editing was perfect to sit and watch the hours of entertaining hockey at it's finest.  Detroit out shot, out skated and scored more goals than the Penguins.  Truly was the entertainment i was looking for in this video.",1356739200,,243,4.738095238095238
8290128,5,B001CW801Q,This has every cup game between the Penguins and the Red Wings from their classic 07/08 finals. Hopefully the rematch in 08-09 comes out too.,1259625600,3,141,4.68
8290129,4,B001CW801Q,"This DVD set is almost perfect, in my opinion.  I'm only 23 years old, but I'm a very dedicated and lifelong Red Wing fan.  Let's go over the pluses of this package here...you get all six Stanley Cup Final games spread across four DVD's, without commercial interruption.  However, the big downside, and only real one in my opinion, is that you can little to no pregame or postgame on any of these games.  Sometimes you get maybe 30-60 seconds before, and maybethe same afterward, but just to recap and/or introduce what you all ready saw.  There is no intermission reports, which isn't the end of the world, but would have been nice and seems like it could be part of a Championship DVD pack.  After Game 6, you do see the presentation of the Conn Smythe and the Cup, along with some interviews and celebration (maybe 15 minutes or so).  Overall, I give this a B+ or so, and if you're a fan, you should invest in this.  The Season highlight/recap video is NOT on this DVD, so if you want that instead/too, you need to get it separately.",1251504000,,1036,4.444444444444445
8290130,5,B001CW801Q,Awesome price on the DVDs.  They arrived very quickly.  I couldn't be more satisfied.  Will definately order from them again.,1238803200,,125,5.15
8290131,4,B001CW801Q,"I am sorry that some people feel they got duped by this set not having the highlight video in it but that is nobody's fault but thier own. The description of this set was perfectly clear to understand and nowhere did it say anything about the highlight video. I pre-ordered this the day it went up on Amazon and I understood fully what I was getting because I actually took the time to properly read the description. I pre-ordered the highlight video at the same time I pre-orfered this set. If you take the time to properly read a description then you won't run into these problems. If you do have a question then email customer service or do some researching on the net. They actually had a page up on the Red Wings homw page that also explained what was going to be in this set so you could have gotten that info from multiple places. Again this is nobody's fault but thier own.

As for the set, Its everything I expected it to be and I am a huge fan of these types of sets. They should release these for all of the recent Red Wing Stanley Cup seasons. I would buy them without hesitation. My one complaint and ultimatly why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they cut pretty much all of the commentary. I enjoy the pregame and postgame commentary. The pregame commentary sets up the game your about to watch and the postgame gives you a nice conclusion. By just jumping right into the game and skipping the commentary you basically cut out an essential aspect to the games. IMO those pre and post game commentaries are vital. It just doesnt feel right jumping right into the game with no setup whatsoever by the commentator's. With how cheap DVD's are to produce there is simply no excuse for cutting out such material. If I were the one in charge of making these sets I would include absolutely everything I could get my hands on. Personally I would love to see all 4 playoff series in a set like this but I can understand why they concentrated on just the finals. In the future it would be nice to have 2 different releases, one that is more expensive and has all 4 series and a cheaper one for those who just want the finals. I would easily pay 50-60 bucks for all 16 victories on DVD.

Beyond that one complaint its a great set. Having these games in DVD quality is awesome especially when the finals were as entertaining as they were. As I am sure most other Red Wings fans are aware, the Wings absolutely destroyed the competition in the finals during the 3 previous cup victories. I think they only lost 1 finals game out of the last 12 before coming up agains Pitt. I was really hoping for a quality series and not another sweep and we absolutely got a great series It was one of the best finals in a long time and this set gives us Winger fans the opprotunity to enjoy it for years and years to come.

Highly recommended even if it is a bit flawed.",1232668800,6,2865,4.292051756007393
8290132,2,B001CW801Q,"The title ""Detroit Red Wings Stanley Cup Champions Special Edition"" led me to believe that this DVD set included the season recap and championship video in addition to the finals games. I mostly wanted the recap, but I was willing to pay a few more bucks to have the recap and all the games from the finals. However as other reviewers have already pointed out, this is simply a bare bones DVD of the finals games with no special features, no regular season recap, no highlights from the other series, no intermission coverage, and no locker-room celebration after the win. Nothing but the actual games. Which is OK, but not what I wanted.

Now to see the recap they want me to fork out another $20? Ridiculous.",1230854400,2,710,4.590551181102362
8290133,3,B001CW801Q,"By biggest grip with this package is that they didn't bother to put anything extra.  Why not include the open and close of each game?  This is more of a coach's copy, periods only, they do offer the celebration at the end of game six, but don't bother to hang around for the team picture, and of course there is no time for the game highlight montage.

The celebration, really every game just cuts off quickly, did they run out of time?  I don't understand that kind of half done producing.  As mentioned by another reviewer, this package does not come with the other Stanley Cup video, again, I would say why not?  If you can put the entire game 5 on one disc, why not put the series show at the end...oh, I know, just go out and buy that one too (classic consumerism tactic).

I'm a long time Red Wing fan, but I would only recommend this if you were not able to watch the games and really wanted to see how it played out.  Or you could buy the other video.  That one is mixed bag too, they used many different cameras, not mixing in much from the actual telecast, and they edit it together so fast that you don't really get to enjoy the actual highlights as much, the creative editing was more important.

Overall, the games package is barely produced & the series highlights video is overdone.",1230681600,3,1297,4.322314049586777
8290134,3,B001CW801Q,"I was duped.  I thought that, by buying this DVD set, that I would also get the NHL season recap video for the Wings.  But, nooooo.  I ended up having to go out and buy that DVD as well.

I watched each of these games.  I video-taped each of these games.  Someday, this set will probably be nice to have.  But buyer beware, if you are buying this to get the Red Wings 2008-09 season recap video, it's not in there.

That should have been made more clear.",1227312000,4,454,4.079545454545454
