8364441,4,B002CVQAVI,"I just loved this movie!  The lead male character played ""S*** Break"" in american pie.  Ha ha.  He's very comedic and true in this.  The lead female played the beautiful love interest of main vampire from ""Lost Boys the Tribe"".  Just great.  If you liked ""Encino Man"" you'll love this one!",1389484800,,289,4.568627450980392
8364442,3,B002CVQAVI,"This is a watchable, fun movie with a slightly inept groom who a lso just happens to be a werewolf.  His 'on top of it' fianc&eacute;e takes matters into her own hands to make sure to keep their wedding from getting too hairy.
The transformations are goofy and his makeup is Lon Cheny meets Philys Diller.  The Alpha wolf however is a complete transformation with unusual legs and jumping characteristics.
This is not a run out to the theatres type movie but good fun for werewolf genre fans.",1368403200,2,492,4.579545454545454
8364443,5,B002CVQAVI,"I saw this movie when it first aired on ABC Family a few years ago. I enjoy movies which explore classic thriller themes in a new way, and I am especially keen on those which can do it without resorting to excessive satanic references or on screen blood and guts. The latter is not particularly interesting and the first is probably something best skipped over. So, in that regard, Nature of the Beast fits into an excellent place in the holiday film line-up since it is neither to macabre or too boring, but strikes a nice balance between seriousness between the two main characters and the absurdity of their circumstances. The DVD version of the film shows evidence of its made for TV origins as the original cuts to commercial have been left in, though obviously without the advertisements. This can make some transitions jerky, but it does not distract from the overall flow of the film excessively. One other factor is the lack of additional content, though again this is understandable since the movies was originally made for TV and, in consequence, the DVD is likely an afterthought. Even so, the price is great so that more than makes up for the issues related to content. A decent enough flick for a Halloween themed family movie that delivers a few thrills but shouldn't cause anyone any sleepless nights.",1337817600,,1317,4.755458515283843
8364444,3,B002CVQAVI,"A made for t.v. comedy, I missed this when it first came out. Anyways that, if you watched the show Ugly Betty, you'll recognize the villian as having played a part in it.

As a romance-comedy where the guy is seeking to lift his curse of werewolfism and his bride-to-be is helping him lift it. It wasn't bad. Many of the actors did very well, there's only one, the guy who played the news report that was just bad acting all around and terrible, over the top and trying to outdo the stars and proper co-star.

Overall the movie has me wanting to compare it with Teenwolf, also done as a comedy, somewhate and for quality.

Also being something of an amatuer werewolf expert, I surprised with how much they drew from an almost obsure source with their werewolf lore for the movie.",1306368000,2,780,4.440559440559441
8364445,5,B002CVQAVI,"Looking for a fun, comedy/supernatural movie?  Now available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, Nature of the Beast is the movie for you.

With a mix of the funny and the sweet, Nature of the Beast makes it a popcorn flick that actually has a well-written storyline. Starting with the basic idea that ""every man is hiding something,"" this film takes a hilarious look at the problems with living with a werewolf. Will Julia still marry her beloved Rich when she finds out that three days out of the month Rich is a true monster?

Nature of the Beast stars Eddie Kaye Thomas, (American Pie movies, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle), Autumn Reeser (""The O.C.,"" ""Pushing Daisies""), Eric Mabius (""Ugly Betty,"" ""CSI: Miami"").  Since I was a big fan of Eric I was happy to see him in the film. His role isn't a huge part of the movie, but it's a good one.

It's a hard to balance the funny and the serious emotional moments, but Nature of the Beast does so beautifully. There's no point where the movie seems slow or too over the top, and the supporting cast makes the film even funnier. I especially love that they keep the actual werewolf shots to a minimum (especially at the beginning of the movie) it adds to the mysterious air of the movie.

Nature of the Beast is definitely a great film and one that you should definitely pick up for your next movie night.",1252368000,2,1363,4.453815261044177
