8491079,4,B000065SNN,"JUDY BERLIN was Madeline Kahn's final movie. In her memory, all profits from its premiere were donated to ovarian cancer research.

The story is set (and shot) in the town of Babylon, L.I. New York, where aspiring actress Judy (Falco) who's ready to leave for Hollywood, meets up with high school friend David Gold (Harnick), an ultra-depressed would-be movie director. Judy's thrilled to be departing for Hollywood, while David despairs over having failed there. As they chat, their highly contrasting moods seem to balance out.

In a separate storyline, David's parents (Kahn and Dishy) are on the verge of a breakup over his dad's affair with Judy's mom (Barrie).

Much of the drama in director Eric Mendelsohn's feature film debut occurs around an autumnal full solar eclipse. Filtered black & white cinematography casts a further gloom over the events of an already sad day. During the darkest part of the eclipse, emotionally subdued folks wander the streets, speaking with neighbors they haven't bothered to notice in a very long time.

Two words that best describe this unique work: realistic and melancholy.
