5743199,5,B00CW32VKA,"I really enjoyed this dvd. The pictures are amazing, especially those taken by the Mars orbiter. Highly recommend this dvd.",1402963200,,123,5.2
5743200,4,B00CW32VKA,"I know I will probably never have a chance to go to Mars. But this 3D Blu Ray DVD allows you to experience what you would see if I did. The views are breathtaking and awesome. I was thrilled to be able to experience what Mar's surface looks like in glorious 3D.
That being said, since this is not a movie, it is kind of boring to watch. Otherwise I would give it five stars.",1402272000,2,374,4.0
5743201,4,B00CW32VKA,"I was hoping it would be 3D video of Mars, but it seems more like just a pan and scan of 3D images of Mars. It's still very nice, as it has some interesting information for each image, and the collection of images are from multiple devices from as far back as 1997 for comparison to the more recent rover images--you can really tell the quality difference and how technology has improved!",1401408000,,388,4.402777777777778
5743202,3,B00CW32VKA,"The images are extraordinary. coming as they do, from Mars. The 3D is also very good. I only gave it 3 stars because it needs a running commentary, perhaps from a geologist or an expert from JPL. Instead, there was background music, and occasional captions that did not tell us much.",1399680000,5,283,4.568627450980392
5743203,5,B00CW32VKA,I CAN'T DESCIBE THIS...YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!..NOT ONE WORD SPOKEN THROUGHOUT..AMAZING 3D...I WAS IN A TRANCE...THE MUSIC SOMBER AND PERFECT.....,1399248000,,142,5.809523809523809
5743204,5,B00CW32VKA,"This is supposed to be a documentary using pictures taken by three different NASA Probes and Orbiters and one Lander. The pictures are great. The details in the photos are exceptionally worth watching. However, be prepared to be extremely surprised by what these pictures objectively will show you.

They are so detailed and the conclusions thereby so inescapable, that this film turned out to be a very pleasant and interesting and fascinating documentary that totally ""blew"" my mind. The inescapable details indicate that we have not been told exactly the whole story behind Mars' History.

Also what also got me, is that there are obvious details in many segments indicating that amoung many other surprises,
Mars currently has some form of an atmosphere. I highly recommend watching this film!! It is really an eye opening experience!",1383696000,8,838,5.154411764705882
5743205,5,B00CW32VKA,"some of the best spectacular 3D images I have ever seen, the only complaint is that there are way to much black/white images instead of true Redish martian color. but I do recommend this bluray.",1383436800,2,194,4.571428571428571
5743206,5,B00CW32VKA,"THIS IS THE BEST 3D MOVIE I WATCH. THE IMAGES LOOKS SO REAL IN 3D THAT YOU CAN FEEL THAT YOU ARE IN MARS.
I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL OF 3D LOVERS. THIS IS A MUST HAVE.",1380412800,,170,3.5
5743207,5,B00CW32VKA,"I was literally awestruck when I began to watch this video. I have seen lots of NASA footage in my lifetime but I had no idea that planetary images with this much resolution even existed. After a few minutes of watching I had the sincere sense that I could just walk out onto the surface of Mars, the 3-D is amazing. Also, I had expected to see only surface images but the video includes 3-D high resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the footage from the orbiter that included zooming shots down into canyons and lava tubes blew me away. I own more than 30 Blu-ray 3-D titles, but when I want to really show off the full capability of my 3-D TV I will show my friends this video.",1369180800,25,702,4.325757575757576
5743208,1,B00CW32VKA,"When you try to select a scene or hit play in the main menu, it thinks and then recycles to the main menu screen without starting the actual presentation.",1442793600,,154,4.344827586206897

5743210,5,B00CW32VKA,Very good 3d . Only the thought that you are watching Mars is great .,1423699200,,69,3.6666666666666665
5743211,1,B00CW32VKA,Same thing over and over again.  Kept waiting for some explanation of what was being shown but very little if any information is supplied.,1423440000,,138,4.75
5743212,2,B00CW32VKA,"i did not like this blu ray because it a demostration of what might happen,no real photo or spin around mars,i would be better watching a movie of mars than watching a demo.",1421020800,,173,4.2727272727272725
5743213,5,B00CW32VKA,"Great 3D pictures.  Freeze a frame, stand close to the large screen, move slightly to the left and right = standing on Mars!!!!!!",1420588800,,129,4.608695652173913
5743214,5,B00CW32VKA,excellent,1420329600,,9,9.0
5743215,5,B00CW32VKA,Everytime someone visits my house we watch this baby in the projector with the 3d glasses. I've seen it 5 times so far and it doesn't get boring. Absolutely spectacular especially if you have a nice screen and setup.,1419984000,,216,4.564102564102564
5743216,3,B00CW32VKA,"Great 3d effects to show off your 3d set but truthfully its a ""One Time Watch"".",1419292800,,79,4.0
5743217,5,B00CW32VKA,Absolutely awesome! Mars is stunning. I had no idea it looked that incredible.,1419120000,,78,5.076923076923077
5743218,2,B00CW32VKA,"While the images of Mars were nice, the 3D could be improved....it showed too much depth.",1417046400,,89,4.625
5743219,1,B00CW32VKA,"Headache anyone? Please hire a Stereographer the next time!!! What a botched job. It's so bad I don't even know where to begin. The glowing reviews are either for a 2D version or just bogus. The way the stereo images were processed you need the eyes of a lizard.  Many create what is known in the trade as Retinal Rivalry, where the two stereo images have discrepancies so the effect is well, disturbing! Many of the images are darker in one eye than the other. A majority of the superimposed sequence titles lack any worthwhile information. If that's not bad enough, they interfere with the images because whoever designed them didn't know squat about 3D! Granted, a few  of the images are compelling but likely by random accident because most are not watchable at all. It appears as if these guys were able to grab some free NASA footage and went about butchering it. Why doesn't NASA just compile a 3D video of their own? At least they care about their image and images. I've been involved in 3D since 1983. Before writing this review I attempted to find these folks and offer my services for free as a public service! What legit company cant be Googled these days? Well, it was easier to get to Mars than contact these folks. They could not have actually watched this in 3D before selling it. It's embarrassing!",1411948800,23,1315,4.591489361702128
5743220,4,B00CW32VKA,Very well done with good 3 D effects. I gave it 4 stars only because it was too short. Viewed it on Samsung 65 with active 3D glasses.,1410739200,,134,3.8214285714285716
5743221,1,B00CW32VKA,"hi !

  seem do not see those rolling machine , just view sand and rock !",1409961600,,73,3.4375
5743222,5,B00CW32VKA,great price fast shipping. For the price liked it. This was awesome.,1409616000,,68,4.75
5743223,4,B00CW32VKA,"Excellent 3D views of Mars from the ground as well as orbiter.  This should be your ""go-to"" DVD for showing friends and family the beauty of your new TV.  The reason I subtracted on star was because other than the first few minutes ALL of the remaining 3D video is in Black and White - still very good but the color portion is SOooo much better",1406678400,10,344,4.196969696969697
5743224,2,B00CW32VKA,"I agree with the reviewer who complained about lack of commentary. The disc is an abject failure as an educational video. A narrator and maps could have shown us, for example, the locations on the globe of the various sites whose images we saw. Onlly once are we informed that a site is near the equator; that's the only time we're given any clue where on Mars the sites are. The brief snippets of written commentary mostly tell us which persons the various hills or craters are named after. It would also be helpful to know (say) why all but the first (and imperfectly executed) stereo images are in black and white, or why some parts of dark rock formations are very light-colored, or from what altitude were the flyby images taken (we're given very little sense of scale), among many other things. There are simply far too many missed opportunities for enlightening commentary. Instead we're given lugubrious and glacially slow music and brief and not terribly informative written blurbs that appear only at the start of new video scenes and which disappear almost before you're done reading them. At least the images are often starkly beautiful and dramatic. But if you're hoping to really learn something from this video, you're out of luck.",1406073600,3,1246,4.827102803738318
5743225,5,B00CW32VKA,"I love 3D and I have had a lifel long love affair with the exploration of space. For me, this is a dream come true. The clarity and depth of the presentation is amazing. I feel like I'm standing on Mars looking out over the  horizon. The fact that is in black and white doesn't detract from this. And, the Surveyor view from space is amazing, except that I do find the view directly down into craters not as realistic as other views. The 3D effect is exaggerated at times then, but it's a small complaint in the overall big picture. So, if you are the kind of person that sit for an hour being amazed that you are looking out over another planet and know you are seeing the real deal, not CGI, this is a great addition to anybody's  3D library",1405814400,8,743,4.188811188811189
5743226,1,B00CW32VKA,They claim this bluray to be region free but it certainly is not. I spent 20 on it and I'm in UK so can't really be bothered with sending it back or any of that nonsense. A lesson in late night shopping well learnt. What was I thinking?,1404691200,3,236,3.9375
5743227,5,B00CW32VKA,As described,1404432000,,12,5.5
8586881,5,B00CW32VKA,Very enjoyable,1490227200,,14,6.5
8586882,1,B00CW32VKA,It looks homemade and it didn't even work. They did give me a refund right away tho.,1482883200,,84,4.0
8586883,5,B00CW32VKA,I'm not sure what those who wrote negative reviews of the this disc were expecting.  I found completely mesmerizing.  The I would offer up the following critique for any future videos from this producer:  More technical details of location (grid co-ordinates) would have been nice.  I thought the altitude and depth exaggeration very helpful.  The new age sound track was meditational and added to the viewing experience.,1471651200,,421,5.223880597014926
8586884,5,B00CW32VKA,"Incredible 3d footage! Unbelievable what the surface of Mars looks like! The only thing that would have made it better, would be to be in color",1470268800,,143,4.538461538461538
8586885,4,B00CW32VKA,Photos from several Mars probes set to music.  The chaos of some landmasses was awe inspiring.  Let's get off our collective duffs and go there.,1467849600,,144,4.72
8586886,5,B00CW32VKA,"Really enjoyed this, great for 3D TV's",1455494400,,38,4.571428571428571

8586888,5,B00CW32VKA,"Originally I wrote: ""i would give it a higher rating if it hadn't been represented as being in 3D. It's got some cool footage, but it's not 3D.""

UPDATE: I was WRONG. The replacement disk sent by the seller worked. And it worked really well.

This is a truly enjoyable Ken Burns style presentation of the topography of Mars. But there is no real commentary. Background music added to the mysterious experience.

The 3D works well for the most part. Watching it on my 1080P big screen LCD projector reminded me why I put my home theater together.",1447113600,,545,4.540816326530612
8586889,5,B00CW32VKA,"Stunning 3D Martian vistas remind me of the movie ""The Martian"".  Beautifully done. Great shipping.",1445644800,,99,5.6
8586890,1,B00CW32VKA,"3D effects are done poorly.  Painful to the eyes.  Also there is no narration, just music and images.",1444348800,,101,4.555555555555555
