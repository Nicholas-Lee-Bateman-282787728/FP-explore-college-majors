I am a 40 years of age and I never play soccer other than when I was 15 on the streets of South America, but never in a serious manner therefore I didn't know anything about soccer, but all that changed when my passion for the game was reignited after the World Cup 2014 and decided that it was not too late to learn this beautiful game, so I researched online to fine a comprehensive but easy to learn guide that would help me get started. So I came a crossed this DVD and I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. This is great for beginners and intermediate level I would say. You will learn how to dribble the ball using different methods such as with the inside or outside of your foot, the sole of your foot and more. You will also learn how to head the ball in different ways, how to shot the ball with different techniques (inside or outside swerve and more!) How to pass and receive the ball, how to turn and evade an opponent! hot to do the bicycle and Rabona kick and 1v1 moves! and this is so easy to follow and understand that a young kid could watch it by themselves and learn! Lest be honest if a 40 y.o.a. man with no experience whatsoever can learn so can anybody else! Don't hesitate in getting this DVD.
I also recommend to sign up for free (if they are still offering it) for the weekly e-mails! they have taught me a great deal regarding tactics, drills, rules and have boosted my confidence. I also recommend his books too! they are great and full of common sense and futbol wisdom! Check my pictures of me doing the famous bicycle kick that I learned thanks to this DVD, this was my second day training for it (I was scare to practice it since I am getting older and fragile lol) but I did what this DVD taught me and what I have learn from Mirsad. And other pictures just showing off lol
I also learned how to bend it like Beckham (I wish) thanks to Mirsad too! I will try to upload my video! keep in mind this Free kick was from 27 yards away!",1439769600,2,2353,4.870324189526184
