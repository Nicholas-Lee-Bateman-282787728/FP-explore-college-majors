A British couple, Chris and Tina, take a caravan (camper) road trip tour of the British Isles, emphasizing quirky destinations such as a pencil museum and a trolley museum. All pretty harmless kind of nerdy fun. Right? Then, what starts out to be a trip of wonderful nerd love discovery turns cult classic dark.

Noisy teens, rubbish chuckers, and overnight camper park hassles drive Chris to his limits and then right over the edge. The results, well, if you're up for correcting all those people that rub you the wrong way on holiday by serving up some cold, hard, caravan justice, then you may want to ride along in the caravan and see the British Isles with Chris and Tina.

Just mind your step, old boy.

5374376,2,B009ZR6Z76,"""Sightseers"" is a 2012 UK film about two travelers Chris and Tina, as well as several dead bodies. The ""comedy"" is executive produced by Edgar Wright, known for his works as director such as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" and most recently, ""The World's End."" Unfortunately, as Mr. Wright must have been very busy, ""Sightseers"" is not directed by him. It is directed by Ben Wheatley, the director of ""Kill List.""

A timid thirty-something woman Tina (Alice Lowe), who has been long living with her domineering mother, travels around the country with her boyfriend Chris (Steve Oram), who arrives in his caravan camper-van. But their holiday journey turns out to be a life-changing experience for Tina - and Chris, too, eventually - because nice and agreeable Chris is in fact a serial murderer.

The script (written by the stars Steve Oram and Alice Lowe, with additional material by Amy Jump) has some potential for interesting dark comedy, or perhaps a thriller, but the film fails to be either of them because of its inability to decide on the tone throughout. As a comedy ""Sightseers"" is too dark, with two main characters that are often annoying and loathsome. As a thriller or a character study the film is just too silly and incredible. The suggested male vs female conflict looks like an afterthought trying to pad out the scanty material in the script.

So what if Edgar Wright had directed the film himself? Probably he would have offered a tighter, more consistent narrative, but honestly, I don't know. All I know is that to me this is a disappointment, something like a missed opportunity.",1382572800,5,1604,4.846715328467154
5374377,4,B009ZR6Z76,"After the Roman Empire fell you got the Goths and Vandals. Ben Wheatley is of the Goths and Vandals school of film-making. He digs up through black humour,comedy, violence,a feeling for the British character and landscape, forgetting the values of civilization. He's of the suburban break-out school of subject matter. Its amazing what you can do with dogs and caravans mixed in with cartoonish killings. I counted 6 killings,perpetrated by Chris(3) and his partner Tina(3),due to petit resentments, feelings of being inconvenienced or slighted in some way. We have no feeling for the victims,stereotypes all:the yobbish litterbug;the flushed,boozy bride-to-be;the snooty National Trust member;the snobby caravanite writing his 3rd book on ancient leys lines. Chris retorts after one killing:""He's not a person,he's a Daily Mail reader!""

Chris and Tina are nerds,a good coggle warding off the savagery of the gales they encounter. They dutifully tick off each tourist site including the Crich Tramway Village and the Keswick Pencil museum. There is a lot of fun to be had and quotable lines of what are the two stand-up comedians(Alice Low,Steve Oram) who wrote a lot of the script. The kills are played down,almost throwaway bones,with suitable sound effects. The couple sport deadpan expressions on their caravan trip from Redditch to Settle in Yorkshire. This bucolic vision of nature worship works but you feel Wheatley's taken a lot from Leigh's Nuts In May as well as the English version of American runaway couples homicidal roadtrips(Bonnie and Clyde,Badlands).What I really loved was the escape into the beauty of the landscape-viaducts,stone circles,caves,the monolithic hinterland-as the landscape gets wilder you feel you're going into the past,into a time before cities and civilization,The physical journey became the journey of the film,from sweet and harmless to the heart of British darkness. There are elements of memory anddream in fantasias of lust and death aimed at linking the couple to a semi-mythical past.",1380758400,,2032,5.471337579617835
5374378,4,B009ZR6Z76,"I've just watched Sightseers:

Sightseers is a British black comedy about an odd couple who go on a caravanning holiday on an anorak tour. I have to say that I didn't find it especially funny,that's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but don't let the review blurbs fool you. It is amusing, but it's more creepy with a sense of humour than an outright comedy.

It does have quite a sinister aspect that draws you through the whole film, I also enjoyed how it didn't follow an obvious path through the story. In places it's a little sad and you're not quite sure which way the film is going to turn.

In some ways it reminded me of Natural Born Killers, but imagine the more over the top almost cartoonish nature of that film and then dowse it in British understatement and I think you get what we have here.

To sum up I liked the film, it achieves a lot with very little and it keeps you entertained all the way through.",1378512000,,921,4.2457142857142856

SIGHTSEERS is brought to you in ""Wheatley-Vision"" (Juicy gore make-up effects, expert editing, soundtrack perfection) and features a pair of fresh-faced actors/writers that knock it way out of the park:  Alice Lowe and Steve Oram seem like old (super-crazy) friends after one viewing.

5374380,4,B009ZR6Z76,"I just saw this movie this weekend here at the Cincinnati World Cinema. I had heard of this movie (which made a splash upon its initial showing at the 2012 Cannes festival), and couldn't wait to see it.

""Sightseers"" (2012 release from the UK; 90 min.) brings the story of Chris and Tina, played by Steve Oram and Alice Lowe, respectively. Alice is 34 yrs., still living with her 'mum', and about to go on a caravan sightseeing tour of Yorkshire and surroundings with her new boyfriend Chris, much to the dismay of her mum. But Tina persists and soon we see Chris and Tina on the road, in the ever damp, wet and gray countryside of England. Then events start happening fast. Chris accidentally runs over a man, killing him. Next Chris kills another camper, on purpose. Tina doesn't find out about it until later, at which point she confronts Chris and he admits to the killings. At this point we're just about half-way into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, please note that the idea for this movie came Oram and Lowe, and they also co-wrote the script. So this is truly the Oram and Lowe show all the way. Second, the scenery in the movie is really outstanding from start to finish, as the movie serves like a postcard for upper Yorkshire,showng us monuments, old churches, and assorted museums (serving as the background for the ""sightseers""). Third, this movie is utterly British, and the dark humor is beyond absurdity. I say this, as this may simply not be your cup of tea. At one point Tina and Chris are trying to justify the murders and Tina offers ""it reduces the victims' footprint"", to which Chris responds ""yes! murder is green!"", ha! This movie was quite successful in the UK but hasn't made a dent whatsoever in the US and this does not come as a surprise, given the subject and the tone of this movie. All that aside, I cannot recall having seen many movies that are anywhere close to ""Sightseers"", so if you are in the mood for something very different indeed, I'd encourage you to check out this movie.",1374278400,5,2150,4.538659793814433

What did I think?

Not a black comedy, an ber-black comedy. No light penetrates the darkness even though people have reported its hilariously laugh-out-loud funny. I laughed. Three times. But the humour here is more creepy and uncomfortable. The type where you cringe as you guffaw. Oh look, he smashed that mans head into pulp  literally pulp (giggle).

5374384,3,B009ZR6Z76,"This is a darkly comic film about two parochial sociopaths who go on a caravanning holiday with a difference. The writing is very sharp and the performances are pitch perfect. The direction is perhaps a little too ascetic for the material but Wheatley always handles his subjects with confidence, and this is no exception. While SIGHTSEERS is often very funny, and is full of wry observation, the characters are not quite sympathetic enough for their heinous crimes to be endurable. As a result of this the film fails to strike quite the right tone. It is, however, well worth a viewing. Memorable, if a little too cold for comfort.

5374387,3,B009ZR6Z76,"The black comedy Sightseers (2012) is a road picture that features a couple who engage in a series of increasingly bizarre killings, as they travel across the English countryside on holiday.  Comedians Alice Lowe and Steve Oram, co-wrote and star in the film.  With some ideas originally developed as comedy sketches, the movie is series of violent and often shocking interludes, that doesn't always make for the most cohesive story.

Lovers Chris (Oram) and  Tina (Lowe) are making their way across England, with a mobile home in tow.  They find themselves in a number of situations where people die, sometimes by accident, and sometimes on purpose.  Chris is apparently experienced at killing, but Tina turns out to have a surprising affinity for homicide as well.  The deaths are not very graphic, but the unexpected and outrageous nature of some of them, adds to their impact.

While black comedy is a well-established British institution, it still took a while for Sightseers to find backing.  Dealing some controversial material, being episodic and uneven in places, and concluding on an oddly abrupt note, it's not the kind of film that will appeal to everyone.  With a particularly twisted point of view, the characters are hard to have empathy for, and much that happens is hardly uplifting.  The comedic styles of Lowe and Oram might be familiar to Brits, but could be an acquired taste for most.  A pitch black British comedy that some may find in questionable taste, the laughter generated by The Sightseers might be mostly of the uneasy variety.",1401062400,,1558,4.996124031007752

5374389,3,B009ZR6Z76,"SIGHTSEERS is very much a team effort: the two stars (Alice Lowe and Steve Oram) also co-wrote the script.  With a distinct nod to earlier films such as Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973), it focuses on two lovers, Tina and Chris, who embark on a caravanning holiday that takes a decidedly bloody turn, as they dispose of several innocent victims.  Ben Wheatley's cinematic style is certainly startling, with its deliberate use of out-of-synch sound, fantasy sequences, memorable short of gore and a soundtrack that includes work by Soft Cell and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The script is deadpan yet extremely funny: both protagonists get some valuable one-liners.  What is perhaps more interesting, however, is Wheatley's focus on his characters' lives; hitherto they have spent their entire existences in total anonymity: Tina has lived with her mother Carol (Eileen Davies), and lavished all her love on a favorite terrier, who was unfortunately impaled to death on some knitting-needles.  The road-trip gives Tina the chance to liberate herself, just like Chris, who dreams of becoming a full-time writer after having been made redundant.  The idea of ""writing"" is significant; it suggest the desire to leave a legacy, to inscribe oneself in the present so as to be remembered.  When Chris' writing dreams come to naught, he looks for alternative ways to establish himself; hence his desire to kill so as not to be pushed around by anyone (i.e. treated as a nobody).  Tina follows suit; but what Wheatley suggests is that the two of them find it very difficult to work as a team - Chris believes that Tina has plagiarized his idea, and resents her for what she has done.  Two serial killers don't attract as much media attention as one.  For her part, Tina learns how to acquire self-determination, even though there are moments when she doubts herself.  The film's ending takes us by surprise, reminding us that the protagonists were not as much in love as we thought they were.  With its Grand Guignol action taking place against a breathtaking backdrop of the rolling hills of Yorkshire and the Lake District, SIGHTSEERS is strong meat, but definitely worth staying with.",1398384000,,2178,5.019444444444445
5374390,4,B009ZR6Z76,"Sightseers (Ben Wheatley, 2012)

Now this is a Ben Wheatley comedy (viz. Down Terrace review), a movie that skewers the conventions of the rom-com, the road movie, and (the spoiler alerts begin thick and fastwhen will you learn to heed that stop sign at the tops of my reviews?) the intelligent serial killer filmby intelligent here I'm talking Kalifornia and Man Bites Dog instead of, say, Final Exam or The Burning, by the bywhile still manageing to remain true to every last one of them. Combine that with Wheatley's eye for a script containing bang-up characters and you've got... a movie that's half muddled mess and half brilliant, at least. It is, to date, my favorite Ben Wheatley movie by a whisker.

Plot: Tina (The World's End's Alice Lowe) has recently started dating Chris (Kill List's Steve Oramalso note that Lowe and Oram co-wrote), and the two of them have decided to take a caravan holiday around England to see some of the more offbeat sites. Things start off swimmingly, but take a nasty turn when Chris accidentally backs the caravan over an obnoxious tourist (Down Terrace's Tony Way) who'd been on a tram tour with them just before. From there, Murphy's Law begins to reign, and every stop they make is plagued by weirder, dumber, more obnoxious people.

The reason that stop sign is up there is that it is impossible to even begin to talk about this movie without spoilers, since everything worth talking about occurs once all that gets off the ground. More importantly, these characters really start coming alive once this movie becomes Natural Born Caravaners. Chris is a fun guy, you'd want to go drinking with him, but once you know what's going on there's no elision at all in your thinking; it works perfectly, aside from one scene that is liable to jar if you weren't paying really close attention earlier. But, well, did you ever read Robb White's Up Periscope? (If you didn't, go do it now, I'll wait.) There's a scene early on in the book where a nasty drill sergeant has revenge got upon him by the recruits he's been training when they build a trap inside a trap, and he falls for it but good. Tina is the trap inside Chris' trap, and it is the evolution of Tina's character throughout the film that makes it as absorbing as it is. You may not realize what you're getting until you actually get it. And then comes that final scene, which manages to be both shocking and utterly predictable, and I still don't know how that works. This is good stuff, this; Wheatley really started coming into his own as a filmmaker right about here, methinks. *** ",1397865600,,2583,4.657894736842105

PROs
 Cinematography: very nice camera work
 Locations: Sightseers was shot at a number of locations with historical context, e.g. the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire and the Pencil Museum in Cumbria.

CONs
 The two misfits who presumably are intended to be the protagonists (Tina & Chris) are generally unlikable, despite a few forced attempts to have us engage with them. Really they are the antagonists, leaving us in a lurch without anyone to care about.
 The humor in Sightseers is highly subjective, almost to the extent that you'll either love or hate it. I usually adore dark humor, but Sightseers just didn't deliver for me. I laughed a few times towards the end.

Comments:
 The script was written by Alice Lowe and Steve Oram, who probably not coincidentally portrayed Tina & Chris on the screen.
 Maybe there's a good movie in there somewhere, but i didn't find it.
 The first onscreen victim of Chris is an impolite litterbug, who perhaps was written in to be more unlikable than Chris. If we're going to be honest, litterbugs are doing us all a favor by reminding us that we live in a wasteful, disposable society with landfills as a temporary measure of ""out of sight, out of mind."" If everyone threw out their trash onto the street in front of their house with nobody to haul it away, we might expediently change the way we consume, to the long-term benefit of all species.

8545786,4,B009ZR6Z76,"""Sightseers"" is a very British film about very British people engaging in a very British pastime and ultimately being driven to distraction by a series of very British problems. Ben Wheatley has a fine eye for detail and an intimate understanding of what it is that makes the British Working Classes tick. If youve spent any time in working-class suburban England, chances are that youve met a couple just like Tina and Chris. Theres something of a whiff of quiet desperation about their lives and obsessions with caravan models and holiday destinations like the ""Crich Tramway Museum"" and ""Mother Shiptons Cave"". Its to Ben Wheatleys credit that he never turns Tina and Chris into buffoonish caricatures. Bizarre as their behaviour and obsessions may be, they're rich, well-drawn characters with unrequited longings and very real frustrations - and when these frustrations come to a head, the viewer, understands where the simmering sense of resentment that precipitates Tina and Chriss homicidal rampage comes from, even if they cannot condone their behaviour.

Think ""Badlands"" filtered through the cosy world of cream teas and crocheted doilies or ""The Honeymoon Killers"" viewed askance through a prism made up of ""Caravaners' Weekly"" and the frustrations of the British Class System and you're getting a decent handle on the tone and flavour of the film. Theres something of a whiff of ""O Lucky Man!"", ""The Wicker Man"" and even ""Carry On Camping"" about ""Sightseers"" and Ben Wheatley exploits a very fine visual palette in order to draw a number of oblique references to British landscapes that exist in reality and also only in the minds of aficionados of British cinema.

Alice Lowe and Stever Oram breathe a very real sense of pathos, naivety and cynicism into their respective characters and its to their credit that the thrust and parry of Chris and Tinas ostensibly buttoned-down, repressed relationship always keeps the viewer on the back-foot to the extent that by the films mid-point one is no longer sure if either has now become the dominant personality in the relationship - or indeed whether the concept of a dominant personality has been completely eschewed in favour of the kind of emergent psychopathic gestalt that seemed to define the homicidal relationships of real-life mass-murdering couples such as the Moors Murderers and Fred and Rose West.

""Sightseers"" is an excellent, edgy and deceptively confrontational viewing experience that will have you laughing out loud one minute and shaking your head the next",1433376000,2,2534,5.175609756097561
