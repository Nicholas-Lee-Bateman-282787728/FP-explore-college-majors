Although this is a remastered version of the original film and the quality is not very good, the movie is brilliant!  It helps to know a bit about the very particular Sicilian mores to truly appreciate this film.  Marcello is the useless, doted, amazingly handsome son of a Sicilian couple.  The Father is always bragging about his son's way with the ladies who indeed fall at his feet wherever the handsome Antonio goes.  An arranged and profitable marriage is made with a deliciously young, virginal and sexy Claudia Cardinale only to end in disaster because after one year of marriage Antonio has not been able to ""do his marital duty"" and Claudia remains ""intact"".  It is a bitter sweet comedy that only an actor of Marcello's caliber and natural virility could have carried off successfully.  A thoroughly delightful film.",1308441600,2,985,5.751724137931035
