8628378,5,B00GXG56CW,Asspiaq * I have heard through the news and other media outlets about the arctic BUT now understand it better after viewing this film. I was entrapped from the moment I switched this film on. Nothing but truths echoed through those most affected by climate change. Gave me a better understanding about Dams and from this film I went on to watch DamNation which end up being another great documentary film that is a MUST WATCH for everybody who cares about the world we live in. MOTHER NATURE IS FORCE OF NATURE THAT MUST BE RESPECTED AND TAKEN CARE OF.,1464393600,2,552,4.53
