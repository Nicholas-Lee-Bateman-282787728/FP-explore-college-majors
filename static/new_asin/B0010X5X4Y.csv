3052785,5,B0010X5X4Y,"Imagine a world like ours, but backwards. That's the environment that 'Sydney White' takes on in this modern retelling of 'Snow White'. The concept is novel, suitable for a rom-com with a bit of a twist. But there's a looming element to the film. It's one of the rare films in the genre that makes me step back and wonder who's behind the camera. In this case it's Joe Nussbaum. I wasn't familiar with the name and saw that he notably directed the short 'George Lucas In Love', a satire of George Lucas life. And that really sets the stage for what makes Nussbaum a perfect choice for this film. It's within reason to think his sense of parody to play up the Snow White plot line. But if my theory's correct, he didn't just parody the story... he parodied the studio.

This film should be considered an era defining piece on the destruction of the outsider narrative in teenage film as through the lens of sardonic arthouse directors like David Lynch. It truly is something to be hold, but it can only be seen under a thin veil of self-awareness. The extremes in this film are extreme, subtly is nill. The politics of student life are tools for an extensive metaphors on populist politics versus classic regimes. Sydney White's 'Fight For The 7th' movement uses imagery typically associated with uprisings or pride. They appeal to the bottom, silent segment to build a revolution from the ground up and opposing the up coming down. White is vigilant in her message, spam her students with pop-up ads and lobbying their groups for support. It culminates in the end with the clubs mocking the pageantry of politics with a song and dance number about White and her movement.

But the Kappa President Rachel Witchworth is the greatest treasure of this film. Her commitment to tradition and values of an age old institution is sadistic and poignantly funny. The old guard must be kept in take. The serfs must not know the power the hold. Snow White's evil witch was clearly evil, but the metaphors Witchworth represents are much more formidable. A totalitarian leader who will literally throw her enemies to the depth for no reason other than her own anger (i.e. when Witchworth hits the guy on the doc in a fury and he falls into the water - he may have swam... but what if he had died? Would their be consequence in this film's world?).She cares for nothing more than maintaining power and expanding her territory (i.e. tearing down the ""Vortex""). Now, all those are run of the mill super villain tropes. But when put into the context of university elections and ""hot or not"" website rankings, it takes on a new level of frightening.

And this is all before even the Seven Dorks come in, which raise the absurdity to a previously inconceivable extreme. Their stereotypes are played out to confounding levels. A film who's proposed morals are about clique mentality actually endorses hivemind mentality within groups. That's pretty whack. But as we already know, that wasn't the real point (call back to that sweet point about how the movie's about totalitarianism). Other reviewers on this page have described their performances better than I ever could, but I will add that they were especially keen to the underlining themes (aside from the masterful Amanda Byrnes, of course).

To those who watch closely, this movie will pose countless moments of yelling ""Who actually does this?"" Most of the time the answer will be, ""No one"". The torturous confusion of seeing fraternity men sing a capella to ask a girl on a date in the library. Simple enough idea right? But have you or someone you've known really experienced something like this? Not likely. It's the fetishized idea of romance that's been feed to generation through light hearted coming of age comedies. Sydney White breaks down this ideas by imploding on the ideas themselves. The tropes play out so swell that it's almost surprised. When Bynes falls asleep and the frat president comes in to do Prince Charming's kiss....that would be expected. Except for the sub-narrative happening where it's so clear that Syndey and sneezy are building a special emotional connection. This is where it gets muddied and I'm sorry if this explanation isn't very good. But Dinky's romance with Sneezy is clearly only existent so the audience can't see Sneezy's romance happen with Sydney. What all this means is that when the kiss happens, we ""expect"" or expectations to be derailed. But then they're not. Sneezy doesn't succeed where Prince Charming hadn't. He never even had to try. The sensation this causes emotionally for the viewer is not something common in cinema. It's a privilege to see played out.

This is masterwork. I'd love to read a real cinema critic take on this film with an open mind to peel back the hidden irony. It's a beautiful ode the movies of innocence while simultaneously allowing skepticism crawl in, for ever changing the genre for almost the next decade. This movie changes how I'll forever see film. Thank you, Nussbaum.",1470441600,,4996,4.811408614668219

Sure it's a parody of college life, but it had the emotional truth of embarrassments and cliques that I still remember forty years later.  It's one of those movies that celebrates making good friends and standing up for what's right and improving yourself, an uplifting experience that I find I crave more often these days.

We really don't let her watch PG-13 movies yet but I thought since it was a contemporary take on Snow White and had Amanda Bynes (when she was somewhat normal) it might be o.k.  The story line is fine and follows somewhat the story of Snow White but there are some strong sexual innuendo and a good bit of foul language that I wish I had known about beforehand.  We don't use any foul language in our house, so thankfully our daughter not knowing any better did not pick up on it and never even noticed (I hope).  I guess I should have known that going in to a PG-13 movie.  As a movie, it's just o.k.  The content I would say is more suitable for older teens and if I was that age I'd probably still just give it 3 stars.  It's not really one of Amanda Bynes' best movies.  If you have smaller kids, I would recommend skipping it until they're older.  It's not the worst movie to show young children and we came through unscathed and if you ask my daughter she would probably say she liked the movie, it's just as a parent I would have rather to have not let her see the movie.",1391385600,,1146,4.103139013452915

Amanda Bynes is adorably lovable, of course, and you get just the right feeling of overwhelming love and support for her cause, which makes you walk away with that nice happy glow in your heart.  There are no surprises here, and its certainly not going to win any cinematic awards, but it's a good show all the same.",1348185600,,531,4.627659574468085

3053004,4,B0010X5X4Y,"I have this huge crush on Amanda Bynes.  I don't know what it is, but she just really, really sits right with me.  She is so the girl I would want to date if I were in college.  She's funny, charming, socially retarded but in a way that makes her endearing and lovable; and she is really, really attractive.  Even though her movies are pure camp delightfulness wrapped up in clich ridden bows, I devour all of them and would watch any of them any amount of times (I've seen `What a Girl Wants' like ten times thanks to cable television).

I just love her and her cheesy teen movie gloriousness.

`Sydney White' is one of her latest, a modern retelling of `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.  Sydney White is going to college, where she doesn't quite fit in but where she is instantly liked; by MOST.  Rachel, student council president and resident `it' girl, loathes Sydney (jealous).  She attempts to destroy her socially and forces her into the arms (or house) or seven dorks.  When she realizes that their home is being condemned in order to provide space for one of Queen Rachel's projects, Sydney decides to fight her for Student Council Presidency, taking a stand for all the ignored souls on campus.

With numerous references to the cartoon, `Sydney White' has a fun and fresh style about it that is comfortable in its familiarity.

The acting is just what you might expect from this type of film.  Bynes is her spunky adorable self.  Sara Paxton is believable as the snotty rich girl, although her `fairness' is debatable (NOT attractive as far as I'm concerned).  Matt Long is your token heartthrob, and he works, but he's nothing extraordinary.  Crystal Hunt is hilarious as Dinky, and the seven dorks are all effective, especially Jack Carpenter, who adds a layer of warmth to Lenny.

It is generic, yes, and totally predictable (aren't ALL of these movies), but it's fun and charming and entertaining and totally watchable.  If you are a fan of brainless teen flicks then check this one out.",1255910400,,2002,4.671428571428572

3053008,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Amanda Bynes and Sara Paxton lock horns in ""Sydney White,"" an updated teen/young adult version of the classic fairy tale, ""Snow White.""  In this version, tomboy Sydney heads off to college to follow in her mother's footsteps.  Part of that plan includes pledging her mother's sorority.  Whenever the head of that sorority (and student president) Rachel Witchburn (Paxton) happens to see Sydney talking to her ex-boyfriend, Tyler (Matt Long), she develops an immediate dislike of her.

Rachel decides to make the sorority rush a complete pain for Sydney  in the hopes that she'll back out and to push her away from Tyler.  Eventually, Rachel publicly humiliates Sydney and the tomboy finds her way to the Vortex, a home for collegiate outcasts.

From Sneezy to Grumpy, the seven outcasts that befriend Sydney have the seven dwarfs covered.  They agree to help Sydney take on the Greek system and Rachel and bring equality among the various groups on campus.

Although ""Sydney White"" is a very funny and enjoyable film, it never really separates itself from every other outcast film that's hit the screen.  The film is very reminiscent of ""Revenge of the Nerds.""  There's plenty of hokey humor, a tad bit of PG-13 sexual humor and some unexpected romance as well.

The cast is likeable.  Especially funny are Jeremy Howard and Adam Hendershott.  Crystal Hunt turns in a clever performance as Dinky, a fellow pledge that befriends Sydney.  John Schneider is also solid as Sydney's father.

Is ""Sydney White"" a keeper?  To a point, yes.  It is an enjoyable enough film that most people over the age of thirteen will enjoy it, but I wouldn't suggest you run out and buy it until you've watched it as a rental or on television first.",1237852800,,1727,4.876288659793815

Amanda Bynes stars as adorable tomboy Sydney White, a plumber's daughter who goes to a top college on scholarship and, because her late mother was a member, is a legacy to that school's most popular sorority.

Unfortunately, that sorority and the student council is run by the wicked Sara Paxton, who takes an instant dislike to Sydney and sabotages her chance to get into the Greek organization.

Virtually homeless on campus, Sydney is taken in by seven ""dorky"" guys who reside in a broken down house on campus that Paxton wants to have condemned.  Now, Sydney and the seven dorks devise a plan to unseat Paxton from her queenly position.

Joe Nussbaum directed this very likable movie, which co-stars Matt Long as the handsome ""Tyler Prince"".

DVD extras include deleted scenes, a gag reel and several ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

She felt attending the same college she would be closer to the memories of her mom.  After being rejected and embrassed by a snobby Sorority Leader /class president she finds she can fit in else where with the forgiveness and help from the Dorks especially Lenny whom she played a sorority pranks on and others that are thought to be different.

That is until the fair Sydney White comes along and catches the eye of Witchburn's former boyfriend, Tyler Prince (Charming). The witch does everything she can to squash Ms. White; however, she underestimates the Power of Seven, when White takes up with the seven dorks in the quaint little house at the end of Greek Row.

Sydney White, a beautiful, motherless misfit is immediately winning as portrayed by Amanda Bynes, as she attempts to knock the Witch (Sara Paxton) off her elite throne in this good vs. evil tale. It's a clever and entertaining parallel to the fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. View it with your daughters, who will recognize and love the stars (and the music) and then take the time to point out all the Snow White references to one another. It was my younger daughter who pointed out the poisoned (i.e. hacked) Apple, which resulted in a deep sleep for White . . . but I recognized the kiss from Prince that brought her back.

3053058,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Sydney White is a  2007 revamped and dorkified version of the classic fairy-tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

When the evil witch of the Kappas' Rachel Witchburn(Sara Paxton) deems Sydney 'non-kappa material' for flirting with her ex-boyfriend and Beta president Tyler(Matt Long) she sends her in the directions of the Vortex, the home of the seven dorks.

When Sydney learns that her mother's group of friends may not be the only answer to find happiness, everything begins to fall into place.

I was going to say untalented as well, but in the right part she actually has a two-dimensional appeal; only this isn't it.

It's billed as a re-telling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but that's an insult to the Brothers Grimm. This ""D"" list movie doesn't even have the class of Kathy Griffin. Like Danny Strong's ""Gurkin"" says at the end of Act Two ""Things are looking grim brothers,"" and a truer word was never spoken.

3053060,3,B0010X5X4Y,"I'm just going to start off by saying that this is not the kind of movie that I would pick to watch on my own time. It was my wife's night to pick which movie we were going to watch, and she had several from which to choose from; but when she saw that I had recently purchased ""Sydney White"" for her from our local video store she opted to watch it over all the other contenders. Personally, I had no opinion either way about this movie; I hadn't heard whether it was good, bad, etc.; so, I was pretty much open to whatever the movie had to offer, I just hoped it was at least a decent movie watching experience.

""Sydney White"" is the story of a young woman (Amanda Bynes) who is in her first year of college, and well, things aren't going as smoothly as she'd planned. After trying to get into an extremely popular sorority, she has found herself ostracized by those she had tried to fit in with and is now living with seven undeniably awkward and socially inept guys in a frat house that resembles more of an old-time, rundown home than your standard college campus fare usually does. As Sydney begins to evaluate her life, which has grown somewhat more complicated due to a burgeoning romance with a modern day prince (in her eyes) named Tyler (Matt Long), and her position on the social ladder of her school, she decides to take a chance and stand up for the outcasts and show the upper echelon of the college hierarchy that being popular isn't always about doing what is conventional or normal.

This movie, as you may have guessed already, is a modern day re-telling of the classic tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarves mixed with your typical coming-of-age comedy. Just like other comedies of this sub-genre, ""Sydney White"" is pretty standard stuff, without a whole lot of new ground being covered, so it's pretty easy to be able to predict exactly what's going to happen next and just how the story will most likely end. One difference that ""Sydney White"" does have from all the other entries in this grouping is the fact that it does mix in the fairy tale element of Snow White to shake the standard proceedings up just a bit. Granted you still know (or at least can make a really good educated guess) how the movie's going to end up, but with the references to the classic tale (both subtle and obvious) the movie manages to be elevated above its merely average status, which is quite rare for this genre.

Amanda Bynes (""She's the Man"") continues her streak of semi-offbeat comedies that manage to entertain her target audience without resorting to the crude jokes or sexual humor that tends to seep into every aspect of this genre. Amanda does another good job here, essentially playing the same character, or one very similar, to the sweet, funny, and sometimes awkward character she played in ""She's the Man""; except this time she doesn't have to dress up like a guy for half the movie. Matt Long as her love interest Tyler Prince (hmmm, I wonder which character from the fairy tale he could be) does a good job as your standard run-of-the-mill cool guy who has the quintessential heart of gold. In this movie, Matt is given an opportunity to show that he is a fairly well-rounded actor by trying his hand at comedy after his semi-dramatic (possibly over-dramatic at times) turn in the early portions of 2007's ""Ghost Rider"". Sara Paxton, who I vaguely remember from the oh-so forgettable spoof ""Superhero Movie"" is adequate as the modern day queen, but she proceeds to go to no effort at all to hide the fact that she is up to no good from the moment she first appears in the movie; the least she could have done was make us try to work for the relation to the fairy tale, not just beat us over the head with the obviousness. Regarding the cast members that portrayed the seven dorks (in this case), it was nice that the guys weren't always in your face with which one they were portraying; and in a few instances I actually had a hard time deciding who certain ones were supposed to be. Although, I bet if I would have been able to remember the various names of the dwarves in Disney's version of the story, I wouldn't have been as hard-pressed to figure out who was who. Lastly, it was nice to see veteran actor John Schneider playing the loving father (a role he perfected on TV's ""Smallville"") to Amanda Bynes' character. John doesn't appear a whole lot in the movie, but he manages to make the most out of what little he is given, and his appearances are most welcome when they occur, as they are essentially the only real dramatic aspects of the story.

Containing a decent amount of humor, some heart-warming moments, and neat references to the fairy tale on which the story is based, ""Sydney White"" is one of the few worthwhile efforts to come out of the sub-genre of coming-of-age comedies in the teen comedy category in quite some time. So, I would have to say that ""Sydney White"" is a movie that is at least worth watching once.

""Sydney White"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexual references.",1219968000,,5022,4.514285714285714

This is a mildly funny film with some help from some quirky characters. The theme loosely follows Snow White and the 7 Dwarves, but I'll be damned if I could tell what dwarves they were supposed to be. Sleepy was easy enough, but Dopey/Happy?, Doc/Sneezy?, Grumpy/Bashful? seamed to all have little traits of each dwarf, this probably worked for the better and gave it a fresher feel.

3053078,3,B0010X5X4Y,"I was captivated by this little charmer this first time I saw it in theaters.  The premise is a modern-day Snow White on a college campus. A little contrived, but hey, it apparently worked. Sydney is your average tomboy who is under all sorts of pressure to pledge herself to her dead mother's old sorority. Well, the sorority girls are no longer what they used to be, and the pampered princesses throw Sydney out into the rain. She winds up taking refuge at the Vortex, a student housing building where lives the guy she dumped for a sorority mission and his six bizarre roommates.

Honestly, I didn't think it would work. But it did, and besides the cuteness there is a little more moral meat as Sydney and her new friends lead a student body revolution. Yeah, it's cheesy and we've seen the revenge-of-the-nerds theme many a time before, but it's so goodhearted and fun that I couldn't help but love it, stereotypes, predictability, and all.

All the characters seemed very much into their roles. I wouldn't say I'm an Amanda Bynes fan, but she failed to annoy me this time around! It was a great blend of an old story with modern college life with clever, roll-your-eyes references to the original Disney animated film. It might bother some people, but as a Snow White fan I thought they were cute.

It's definitely a girl movie, I'll give you that, so if you can't put up with the silliness and the cheesiness, you will not enjoy it. But if you're a girl looking for a cute movie with a lot of harmless fun, this will hit the spot.

It had something of the Snow White twist on it, but that really made it no more interesting and became a one-trick pony quickly.  If you are an obsessed fan of Snow White, you may get a little more out of it.  For the rest of us, you know how it's all going to play out from the first few minutes and it just drags on.  There's no energy, nothing clever.

Her mother was a legacy KAPA, (like the best sorority in the school). Her dad is a plumber and her mom died when she was just a little girl so she is a tomboy. Since her mom is a legacy KAPA she automatically gets to pledge. When Sydney White finds out her rival Rachael Witchburn, (Sara Paxton) won't let her be a KAPA because of a guy named Taylor Prince, she is crushed.
 After she is kicked out of the KAPA house, she has no place to live. She sits out on the street and starts to cry with it pouring down rain right in front of the vortex. (The vortex is a place where you go if u don't fit in) There is seven dorks/outsiders that live there. They see her out in the rain all alone and they ask her if she wants to live there. Living with seven dorks that are guys was her plan when first coming to this college, but she couldn't say no or she would be living on the streets. She makes them run against the Greeks in the student council election.
 I enjoyed this movie because it is funny and has a wonderful story line. I would give it two thumbs up! I think you would enjoy this movie if you liked movies with comedy and Amanda Bynes. If you have seen Accepted or John Tucker Must Die, and liked them, then you will probably like this movie.
 The moral or lesson to this movie is that everyone has a little bit of dork in them, even if everyone else thinks they're perfect, they're really not!
 So, will the dorks win student council or will the Greeks run the school forever? Will Sydney end up with Taylor Prince or will Rachael steal him away? You'll just have to watch this exciting and hilarious movie to find out!",1208217600,,1745,4.184523809523809
3053081,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Amanda Bynes mines Disney territory in this almost clever take on ""Snow White."" She stars as Sydney White, an awkward freshman who has just started college at her deceased mother's alma mater and is a sorority legacy. But witchy president Rachel Witchburn takes an immediate dislike to her when her ex-boyfriend Tyler shows interest in Snow, or rather Sydney. Rachel schemes to get Syd blackballed and her only option for housing is to bunk with the dwarfs, or rather the dorks down the road. Sydney soon dusts herself off and plots to get even with the duplicitous Rachel, while aiding her fellow dorks to be more hip.

I wanted to really like this movie - I loved the premise and the setting in a college campus, but the movie just drags and never really catches any momentum. Bynes character is so similar to Viola in ""She's the Man,"" that it's like she's doing an imitation of herself (and a poor one at that). It's an utterly forgettable movie that you're better off catching on cable provided you're already caught up on your laundry, which is a real shame since it had the potential to be so much more. Better yet, skip it and check out the original dorkfest, ""Revenge of the Nerds.""",1206489600,,1190,4.613207547169812

Unfortunately, the President hates her on sight for taking her ex-boyfriend and the war is on.

The story's predictable and we have a very commercial spin on the 'poisoned Apple' but it's an amusing way to spend an hour and a half.  And the dork in me definitely cheered her on.",1206230400,,567,4.423076923076923

I put it in as I was watching it, my wife walked in and watch it, then my twin 18 year old  sons wandered in and.. well we all watched it and laugh.  I know that this isn't master piece and I wouldn't tell you it was, but it is sweet family movie that has laughs and a moral or two to teach.  We had fun trying to name the dorks and remembering the references to REVENGE OF THE NERDS.  But any movie that can get my family to sit down to and to watch together is very special indeed.

3053087,3,B0010X5X4Y,"This light-hearted teen film puts yet another twist in the Snow White fairy tale, with the cherubic teen queen of comedy (Amanda Bynes) in the lead role.

Well versed in the role of the underdog rising to a challenge, Bynes' character sets off to college to follow in her mother's footsteps, but finds the going rather Grimm.  The witch in this version is spelled with a ""b"", not necessarily for ""blonde"", and Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton of Aquamarine) is set on making Sydney's life a living hell.

Jealous that Sydney has become the apple of the eye of her ex-boyfriend Tyler Prince (Prince - get it?), Rachel engineers a scheme to publicly humiliate our heroine, which sends her deep into the black hole of the Vortex (a dilapidated campus building), where she meets seven antisocial dorks (!)  whose habits match up to the seven little guys in the original tale.

Never one to let a witch have her day, Sydney gives Rachel a dose of her own medicine, and the result is a teen comedy that's funny in places, but overdone in others.  It's okay, but no classic, and not one you'll want to ride off with into the sunset for your happily ever afters.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

1. Bynes shines, supporting cast not so much
2. Geeks take on Greeks
3. Brothers Grimm think: ""Hey! They turned our witch into a blonde!""
4. Gentlemen don't always prefer blondes
5. Good guys live geekily ever after

3053108,5,B0010X5X4Y,This movie was amazing. It really told about greek life that a lot of people do not know about. It did not only show the ba of the greek houses but the good as well. Just all in all it was the best movie that Amanda Bynes has starred in.,1203638400,,237,3.76

3053110,4,B0010X5X4Y,"In a town and an industry where everyone just wants to be ""in,"" Amanda Bynes, like her title character in ""Sydney White,"" dares to stand out.

Amanda Bynes has certainly become the a-typical young Hollywood starlet in the past few years: she has not been photographed underage drinking at clubs; she has not gotten arrested or subsequently had to check into rehab; and perhaps mostly notably, she has embraced her young fans, delivering them consistently cheerful, cute, and simply inoffensive comedies.  Joe Nussbaum's ""Sydney White,"" a modern-day retelling of the classic Grimm fairytale, is another such example of Bynes' charismatic comedic ability to be one part trendy Mean Girl (but after she breaks the Spring Fling tiara apart) and one part modern day prat-fall queen ala Lucille Ball.  Her fearlessness to appear goofy amid droves of superficiality is refreshingly relatable, as she plays off her own inner dork in ""Sydney White.""

Nussbaum's version of a childhood classic has his heroine, Sydney (Bynes), entering college (the fictional Southern Atlantic University) with the sole directive of seeking out and pledging her late mother's sorority, Kappa Phi Nu, in order to give herself the fantastical college life she sees in her mother's old pictures.  Jealous that fraternity president Tyler Prince (the always charming Matt Long) has caught Sydney's eye and that Sydney is steadily climbing her way up the Hot Or Not? list, Kappa leader Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton) orders her blonde army of followers to ostracize the genuinely down-to-Earth brunette, despite her legacy.  Sydney seeks out refuge in the Vortex, the least popular frat on the Row, living with seven (slightly short) dorks, including one who refuses to talk unless it's through a puppet.  Very quickly, however, she learns she has much more in common with fellow comic book lovers than with the materialistic hyenas hell-bent on disbanding the Vortex and building their own house expansion in its place (a plot point that mixes ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with the upcoming ""I Know What Boys Like"" and thankfully manages to tell its story closer to the success of the former rather than the latter).  She and her sidekicks set out to dethrone Rachel and give back to all of the neglected activities and clubs that aren't a part of the Greek system.

Cinematographer Mark Irwin and editor Danny Saphire have worked together to create bright, saturated images, evoking the rich colors of the original Snow White's animation.  Bynes in particular seems to glow in this film, a thin halo of light reflecting off of her chestnut hair.  Upon first glance, it does look a bit odd, almost as if the image has not been compressed properly for a common television's specs.  However, as the film goes on, and that same light reflects the twinkle in Long's eye, it becomes apparent this was not a mistake but one of its attempts at stylization, just like the expositional voice over.

""Sydney White"" on DVD does not disappoint in the Bonus Features department, either, offering six deleted scenes with commentary from the director.  Surprisingly, these scenes are just as fun as the ones that actually made the cut.  A YouTube-worthy piece on the ""mascot"" Skoozer is sure to be a hit with the tween crowd, and a short gag reel gives the home viewers a quick behind-the-scenes look at what production was like on the ""Sydney White"" set.  The real gems, however, are the five featurettes that explore the characters and the actors who bring them to life.  ""Sydney and Her Prince"" is a five-minute look at the chemistry between Bynes and Long, both in and out of character. ""Meet The Dorks"" is exactly what it claims to be: an almost ten-minute piece on the actors who play Bynes' sidekicks, most notably Samm Levine and Danny Strong.  ""Kappas Forever"" introduces the audience to Sara Paxton and her minions (the sorority girls and Sydney's seeming-nemeses in the film), begging the question ""is this what sisterhood is really all about?""  ""Welcome To The Vortex"" is a five-minute tour of the boys' house; and finally, ""The Original Dork"" is a ""Making Of"" documentary where Nussbaum and the cast discuss his style and some tidbits from the filming of the movie.

""Sydney White"" is not unique in story nor message, especially when compared to Amanda Bynes' other work (""What A Girl Wants,"" ""She's The Man""), but it provides a fun, light-hearted ride for both those about to enter college and those who just got out nonetheless.",1201910400,,4490,4.985274431057563
3053111,4,B0010X5X4Y,This is a classic retelling of Snow white and the seven dwarfs in a college setting.  Sydney White (Bynes) leaves home to go off to college and plans on pledging the sorority of her late mother.  She finds that the sorority is not what she imagined and that she doesnt fit in.  She finds herself rooming in a house with 7 other outcasts.  She ends up helping them run for school council against the people that she didn't fit in with and who humiliated her.  A great movie about finding out who you really are and being happy with yourself.  It did have a drinking scene and a couple of bad words.  Also had a reference to homosexuals which was in a scene about reaching out to everyone to get their vote for student council.,1201824000,,725,4.325925925925926
3053112,3,B0010X5X4Y,"For those who are fans of Amanda Bynes, we have come to expect (what I would characterize as) quality ""teen movies"" from her.  I was a huge fan of both ""She's The Man"" and ""What a Girl Wants,"" so naturally when this came out I had to get it!

The movie tells the story of Sydney White, a girl whose mother died when she was young.  Subsequently, her father raised her and introduced her to the men's side of life, rather than girls, gossip, makeup and (of course) boys.  When Sydney goes away to college she pledges at the same sorority that her mother pledged at when she was in college.  When the current president of the sorority takes a disliking to Sydney and has her pledge pass revoked because of silly customs, Sydney takes action.  Not only does she move down the ""Greek Row"" to the Vortex (a house for people who have no where else to go), but she helps its current occupants to be strong, learn to live and have some fun.  Sydney soon learns that it is better to be the kind of person her mother was than to simply do things based on tradition/memories of her mother.

Although I did not think that this was as good as the other Amanda B. movies I mentioned up top, I still think it is a great movie.  If you want something fun and entertaining to watch this is a great movie to choose.  Bynes is charming as usual and you will definitely enjoy her!!",1201651200,,1361,4.260700389105058
3053113,4,B0010X5X4Y,"This is an enjoyable comedy, but it's not for those who prefer more artful scripts and acting. While the plot is a familiar one, the performances of Amanda Bynes (Sydney), Sara Paxton (Rachel), and Crystal Hunt (Dinky) provide the right mix of contrasting characters for this predictable young adult romantic comedy/farce.  The ""Revenge of the DORKS"" subplot adds some feel-good silliness.",1201564800,,389,5.377049180327869
3053114,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Let me begin by saying that I'm a BIG Amanda Bynes fan so the possibility of me disliking anything she's in is next to impossible. Now to the matter at hand, the '07 film `Sydney White' is Amanda doing what she does best; starting off on a new adventure on her own (this time going away to college), falling in love with campus the hottie (Matt Long), battling his ex-girlfriend and resident sorority b*t*h (Sara Paxton) and almost single-handedly changing the inequities of university social life. That girl can do just about anything!

There's not a lot new here (OK nothing) in terms of storyline but the production values are excellent and the cast outstanding. All that and Amanda too! What more could anyone ask for?

3053115,4,B0010X5X4Y,"I think Amanda Bynes is hilarious. I think she's probably the best comedic actress in her age range today. But this movie was a little light on the humor. And what humor it did have, was mainly given to the seven dorks. Jokes like the ""hi ho"" moment were very funny but they weren't her jokes. I think Amanda was under used in this movie. I much prefer ""She's the Man"" or even her sitcom ""What I like about you""",1201219200,,411,4.15
3053116,4,B0010X5X4Y,"Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) is a modern day adaptation of the timeless fairytale Snow White. In this instance, our heroine is a college student away from home for the 1st time. She is rejected by the sorority that was her deceased mother's alma mater and finds herself instantly homeless and a social outcast. With nowhere else to go, she ends up at ""The Vortex"" (the campus house that is infamous for sucking up all the losers). She is taken in by the seven dorks that live there and the laughs begin in earnest. In many ways it's like Snow White meets Revenge of the Nerds.
  The other cast members include John Schneider (Sydney's father), Matt Long (Tyler Prince- Sydney's love interest), Sara Paxton (Sorority Leader & student council president- Rachel Witchburn), Jack Carpenter (Lenny- the head ""dork""), Jeremy Howard (Terrence Lubinecki- the dork that dares to run for student council president against Rachel).
  While it is totally predictable, it is still worth watching if you are in the mood for something light and frivolous. Amanda Bynes once again shows her talent at comedic timing and proves that she really is a decent actress. It is rated PG-13 for some language, sexual humor and college partying. I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers but think the preteen to younger teens will find it utterly delightful.",1201132800,,1334,4.941964285714286
3053117,5,B0010X5X4Y,"My family and I watched this together and we all loved it!  Such a fun movie!  I loved the similarities with Snow White.  The actor who portrayed ""Dopey"" was hilarious, as was the dog puppet!",1201046400,,191,4.4
3053128,5,B0010X5X4Y,"It's movies like this that the high-power film reviewers love tearing to shreds for their alleged lack of originality, and in a society where quirky comedies such as ""Waitress"" and ""Juno"" (the types of movies that Ebert and the others love to eat right up), perhaps we won't be seeing the more basic chick flicks at the next Academy Awards show. Setting all that aside, it doesn't take a genius to know that the opinions of the general public make a difference too, and if you're the kind of person who loves a sweet, deliciously cheesy chick flick with a nice moral behind it, you're going to love ""Sydney White."" The bottom line is that it all comes down to formula, and with comedic pro Amanda Bynes leading the way, there is plenty to love about this modern update of the age-old tale about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""

""Sydney White"" tells the story of an 18-year-old high school graduate who, after being raised by her widowed father, is ready to experience college for the first time. Joining a top-notch sorority at her chosen university may not seem to fit right with Sydney's unique, non-conforming personality, but in this case, it's her own way of connecting with her deceased mother. Once there, trouble lurks with Kappa queen Rachel Witchburn, and if you are a female, you know all about what happens when a petty little high school/college girl decides she doesn't like you. From there, it's up to Sydney to find another way to make the most out of college, and when she befriends seven dorky guys from outside the general social circle, she may find more than her original plan could have offered her.

Again, Amanda Bynes has firmly established her sweet, genuine, and widely effervescent personality with films such as ""What a Girl Wants"" and ""Hairspray,"" and perhaps most notably, her lead role in the hugely entertaining (and sadly short-lived) TV series ""What I Like About You."" Her role in this film doesn't break the mold from what she's done in the past, but it is true proof that Bynes knows what's she's good at, and there's no doubt that her loyal fan base will love her in this movie. As another reviewer has indicated, Bynes is easily one of the most underrated young star of her generation, but for those who appreciate her most, her films never disappoint. Her characters always have a good moral behind them, and I give the girl major props for keeping her head on straight in a society where it would be so easy for a star her age to go the other way. With her character Sydney, she does a nice job of showing that there's more to college than being a popular sorority girl. Still, before you assume that it's just another slam on contemporary Greek life, rest assured that the underlying message is about using your college experiences to do what makes you happy and maybe even help others along the way, no matter what it is.

Matt Long and Sara Paxton also turn in fun performances, if not a bit clichd, but most people who go to see this movie in the first place won't mind that too much. They had to take on the age-old roles of the Prince Charming and Wicked Witch, but both managed to keep it completely lighthearted and enjoyable. Some have said that Paxton was not convincing enough, but I thought she nailed that ""evil eye"" and the nasty, b*tchy exterior perfectly, and Long had terrific chemistry with Bynes. I have to admit that I have never seen a guy serenade a girl with roses and a line of fraternity singers in a library (although it would be quite nice to experience), but if that scene annoys you, then you were probably never interested in the standard chick flick, anyway. Movies like this are supposed to entertain and provide a brief retreat from reality, so it's not really worth it to argue the plausibility of these things.

The Seven Dorks are also a delight (of the seven original characters, I noted Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, and Sleepy), and another unexpected gem is Crystal Hunt, whose name in the film (Dinky) is more than enough to describe her personality. Some might be annoyed by her, I guess, but as for me, she was a genuine scene-stealer who made me laugh every time she came on screen.

My only gripe with this overall successful and enjoyable movie is that as much as Amanda Bynes wants to gain some respect as a dramatic actress, I think she may be better off sticking with the comedy. I don't mean to be critical, because she truly is one of my favorite young actresses (not to mention a true class act compared to certain others), but she had a few emotional scenes here that called on her to cry and put on a pouty face, and I just could not buy into it. Maybe it's just that Bynes has established herself as a goofy, off-the-wall comedienne since she was about 9 years old, but she seemed to be trying way too hard with the drama. Perhaps she will improve with that as she gets older and takes on different types of roles, but again, Bynes is a born natural with comedy, and I hope she never strays from that.

Anyway, now that this is on DVD, it is a perfect movie to rent on a Saturday night and enjoy with some popcorn and good friends. If this is your kind of flick, then you know who you are, and the predictable, slightly corny plot will not bother you a bit (and in fact, it's exactly what makes it good!)",1200960000,,5293,4.508333333333334

3053130,2,B0010X5X4Y,"Presently mired in infantile dreck like ""Sydney White"", the hugely talented Amanda Bynes must be counting down the days to 2011, when she will receive her first of two Oscars for Best Actress. Gazing in my crystal ball here, I see that in 2010 Amanda will have a small role in a Woody Allen film that consists of little more than Woody's inane musings. Her role, however however minuscule, prompts studios other than Disney to start taking her seriously, and she is offered a lead role opposite Jude Law in a gripping, heart-wrenching drama. The following February, she is standing onstage at the Kodak Theatre, having beat out Keira Knightley, Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench and Mary-Kate Olsen (don't ask). Until that glorious day, however, we are forced to watch our favourite actress attempting to slog through poorly-written, cliche-laden nonsense like ""Sydney White."" Although our Amanda gives it her usual 110%, the premise and script are so poor she might as well not have bothered. Seeing her in this film is like watching somebody attempt to go off-roading in a Rolls-Royce. A horrible, jaw-clenching waste. So in short, if you're an Amanda fan, skip this one, if you're Amanda, when Woody calls, pick up the phone on the first ring.",1200614400,,1239,4.9330143540669855

Eventually, she became one of the guys working with construction and plumbing. Her lifestyle changes when she's accepted to Southern Atlantic University, where she joins Kappa Pheta Nu, a sorority that her mother was formerly part of.

And with the help of frat boy Tyler Prince (Matt Long), she and the dorks campaign to take over student government.

Somewhere in the midst of teen queens like Miley Cyrus, Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, the Olsen Twins, and Hayden Panatierre, Amanda Bynes easily the most underrated. Originally part of the ""All That"" sketch show, Bynes is a rare talent who is quite attractive and willing to throw herself into comedic situations without embarassing herself. Think of Jenny McCarthy for the tween set. Yeah, call me a homo, but I love the gal.

Too bad her movies don't fare well. Aside from mainstream releases like ""Robots"" and the screen adaptation of the musical ""Hairspray"" (an overrated piece of garbage with Brittany Snow making me want to gouge my eyes out, though the rest of the cast at least made it palapable), Bynes never has much luck with leading lady movies. Admittedly, they're not works of art, but compared to the estrogen-loaded films out there (such as this year's ""Bratz""), at least I can go in there and not feel dirty. On that, here's Bynes' latest, ""Sydney White"".

An innocently directed film by Joe Nussbaum (""American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile""), at least ""Sydney"" is willing to throw in a good amount of irreverence to keep it from giving into chick flick cliches. Nussbaum invites plenty of material for the guys to get into, including some girls with skimpy swimwear, a love interest given plenty of life thanks to Matt Long's (last seen in ""Ghost Rider"") confident performance, references to Star Wars and popular video games (""Medal of Honor"" and ""God of War"" are the many titles referenced that are melded into a single video game), and enjoyable takes on cliched characterizations (MySpace users, emos, virgins, etc). Mind you, it's not original material, and the soundtrack is typical teen pop (look out for Dashboard Confessional and Jesse McCartney tracks), but compared to ""Bratz"" (which I haven't seen), it won't bash your head and lower your IQ's.

Besides, who can go wrong with an appearance from Bo Duke himself, John Schneider?

Bynes is complimented with a pretty good side cast, especially newcomer Crystal Hunt. A veteran of the daytime soap opera ""Guiding Light"", Hunt trades in melodrama with a nice performance as one of Sydney's best friend. Hey, if it worked for Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Passions"" to ""Sky High""), it'll do gangbusters for Hunt. The dorks are newcomers (except for ""The Hills Have Eyes 2006"" Samm Levine), but unlike today's batch of indistinguishable actors, they're full of fun and get a share of laughs.

The only weak link is Sara Paxton. Rachel is written as a take-no-prisoners villain, and a reimagining of the Snow White witch, but Paxton is a kitten going against a wild lion. It's not a terrible performance, and she can rock a mean bikini, but I could name a bunch of other actresses who could dive into the role of Rachel and let the venom circulate. Hell, even Paxton's screaming fits aren't funny, they're just annoying.

Aside from that, the rest of the film is enjoyable without being cloying. Sure, the film tries to go Adam Sandler and try to end the film with a message of acceptance. But like ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"", the film is so endearingly lovable that the message is able to sink in with the comedy bits. Sadly, this film will disappear off the radar in the coming weeks. But I'll take Amanda Bynes over the crop of today's overrated tween princesses. Any single day.",1190937600,,4110,4.905035971223022
3053136,4,B0010X5X4Y,"As I watched this latest Amanda Bynes film it struck me that the plot is a cross between Snow White and Revenge of the Nerds.  Bynes, one of the funniest teen actresses since Patty Duke, plays a girl pledged to a sorority that her late mother belonged to.  But she doesn't fit in with the snobs and gets kicked out, so she lives with seven nerds, or dorks.  They help her prepare for a date, and in return she helps them campaign for student council against the popular sorority and fraternity kids that have been ruling the campus for decades.  Bynes is very funny, the story is good (based on Snow White), and the comedy is almost entirely suitable for the whole family - but still very funny.  John Schneider (Smallville) plays her father.",1190419200,,742,4.507462686567164

3287282,5,B0010X5X4Y,"Imagine a world like ours, but backwards. That's the environment that 'Sydney White' takes on in this modern retelling of 'Snow White'. The concept is novel, suitable for a rom-com with a bit of a twist. But there's a looming element to the film. It's one of the rare films in the genre that makes me step back and wonder who's behind the camera. In this case it's Joe Nussbaum. I wasn't familiar with the name and saw that he notably directed the short 'George Lucas In Love', a satire of George Lucas life. And that really sets the stage for what makes Nussbaum a perfect choice for this film. It's within reason to think his sense of parody to play up the Snow White plot line. But if my theory's correct, he didn't just parody the story... he parodied the studio.

This film should be considered an era defining piece on the destruction of the outsider narrative in teenage film as through the lens of sardonic arthouse directors like David Lynch. It truly is something to be hold, but it can only be seen under a thin veil of self-awareness. The extremes in this film are extreme, subtly is nill. The politics of student life are tools for an extensive metaphors on populist politics versus classic regimes. Sydney White's 'Fight For The 7th' movement uses imagery typically associated with uprisings or pride. They appeal to the bottom, silent segment to build a revolution from the ground up and opposing the up coming down. White is vigilant in her message, spam her students with pop-up ads and lobbying their groups for support. It culminates in the end with the clubs mocking the pageantry of politics with a song and dance number about White and her movement.

But the Kappa President Rachel Witchworth is the greatest treasure of this film. Her commitment to tradition and values of an age old institution is sadistic and poignantly funny. The old guard must be kept in take. The serfs must not know the power the hold. Snow White's evil witch was clearly evil, but the metaphors Witchworth represents are much more formidable. A totalitarian leader who will literally throw her enemies to the depth for no reason other than her own anger (i.e. when Witchworth hits the guy on the doc in a fury and he falls into the water - he may have swam... but what if he had died? Would their be consequence in this film's world?).She cares for nothing more than maintaining power and expanding her territory (i.e. tearing down the ""Vortex""). Now, all those are run of the mill super villain tropes. But when put into the context of university elections and ""hot or not"" website rankings, it takes on a new level of frightening.

And this is all before even the Seven Dorks come in, which raise the absurdity to a previously inconceivable extreme. Their stereotypes are played out to confounding levels. A film who's proposed morals are about clique mentality actually endorses hivemind mentality within groups. That's pretty whack. But as we already know, that wasn't the real point (call back to that sweet point about how the movie's about totalitarianism). Other reviewers on this page have described their performances better than I ever could, but I will add that they were especially keen to the underlining themes (aside from the masterful Amanda Byrnes, of course).

To those who watch closely, this movie will pose countless moments of yelling ""Who actually does this?"" Most of the time the answer will be, ""No one"". The torturous confusion of seeing fraternity men sing a capella to ask a girl on a date in the library. Simple enough idea right? But have you or someone you've known really experienced something like this? Not likely. It's the fetishized idea of romance that's been feed to generation through light hearted coming of age comedies. Sydney White breaks down this ideas by imploding on the ideas themselves. The tropes play out so swell that it's almost surprised. When Bynes falls asleep and the frat president comes in to do Prince Charming's kiss....that would be expected. Except for the sub-narrative happening where it's so clear that Syndey and sneezy are building a special emotional connection. This is where it gets muddied and I'm sorry if this explanation isn't very good. But Dinky's romance with Sneezy is clearly only existent so the audience can't see Sneezy's romance happen with Sydney. What all this means is that when the kiss happens, we ""expect"" or expectations to be derailed. But then they're not. Sneezy doesn't succeed where Prince Charming hadn't. He never even had to try. The sensation this causes emotionally for the viewer is not something common in cinema. It's a privilege to see played out.

This is masterwork. I'd love to read a real cinema critic take on this film with an open mind to peel back the hidden irony. It's a beautiful ode the movies of innocence while simultaneously allowing skepticism crawl in, for ever changing the genre for almost the next decade. This movie changes how I'll forever see film. Thank you, Nussbaum.",1470441600,,4996,4.811408614668219

Amanda Bynes catching a prank football throw at a college nerd and throwing it back at the prankster so hard to knock him over hooked me, with even better scenes later.  Sure it's a parody of college life, but it had the emotional truth of embarrassments and cliques that I still remember forty years later.  It's one of those movies that celebrates making good friends and standing up for what's right and improving yourself, an uplifting experience that I find I crave more often these days.  Definitely a movie I have watched more than six times in the last two months.",1401494400,,664,4.64957264957265

We really don't let her watch PG-13 movies yet but I thought since it was a contemporary take on Snow White and had Amanda Bynes (when she was somewhat normal) it might be o.k.  The story line is fine and follows somewhat the story of Snow White but there are some strong sexual innuendo and a good bit of foul language that I wish I had known about beforehand.  We don't use any foul language in our house, so thankfully our daughter not knowing any better did not pick up on it and never even noticed (I hope).  I guess I should have known that going in to a PG-13 movie.  As a movie, it's just o.k.  The content I would say is more suitable for older teens and if I was that age I'd probably still just give it 3 stars.  It's not really one of Amanda Bynes' best movies.  If you have smaller kids, I would recommend skipping it until they're older.  It's not the worst movie to show young children and we came through unscathed and if you ask my daughter she would probably say she liked the movie, it's just as a parent I would have rather to have not let her see the movie.",1391385600,,1146,4.103139013452915

Amanda Bynes is adorably lovable, of course, and you get just the right feeling of overwhelming love and support for her cause, which makes you walk away with that nice happy glow in your heart.  There are no surprises here, and its certainly not going to win any cinematic awards, but it's a good show all the same.",1348185600,,531,4.627659574468085

3287501,4,B0010X5X4Y,"I have this huge crush on Amanda Bynes.  I don't know what it is, but she just really, really sits right with me.  She is so the girl I would want to date if I were in college.  She's funny, charming, socially retarded but in a way that makes her endearing and lovable; and she is really, really attractive.  Even though her movies are pure camp delightfulness wrapped up in clich ridden bows, I devour all of them and would watch any of them any amount of times (I've seen `What a Girl Wants' like ten times thanks to cable television).

I just love her and her cheesy teen movie gloriousness.

`Sydney White' is one of her latest, a modern retelling of `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.  Sydney White is going to college, where she doesn't quite fit in but where she is instantly liked; by MOST.  Rachel, student council president and resident `it' girl, loathes Sydney (jealous).  She attempts to destroy her socially and forces her into the arms (or house) or seven dorks.  When she realizes that their home is being condemned in order to provide space for one of Queen Rachel's projects, Sydney decides to fight her for Student Council Presidency, taking a stand for all the ignored souls on campus.

With numerous references to the cartoon, `Sydney White' has a fun and fresh style about it that is comfortable in its familiarity.

The acting is just what you might expect from this type of film.  Bynes is her spunky adorable self.  Sara Paxton is believable as the snotty rich girl, although her `fairness' is debatable (NOT attractive as far as I'm concerned).  Matt Long is your token heartthrob, and he works, but he's nothing extraordinary.  Crystal Hunt is hilarious as Dinky, and the seven dorks are all effective, especially Jack Carpenter, who adds a layer of warmth to Lenny.

It is generic, yes, and totally predictable (aren't ALL of these movies), but it's fun and charming and entertaining and totally watchable.  If you are a fan of brainless teen flicks then check this one out.",1255910400,,2002,4.671428571428572

3287505,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Amanda Bynes and Sara Paxton lock horns in ""Sydney White,"" an updated teen/young adult version of the classic fairy tale, ""Snow White.""  In this version, tomboy Sydney heads off to college to follow in her mother's footsteps.  Part of that plan includes pledging her mother's sorority.  Whenever the head of that sorority (and student president) Rachel Witchburn (Paxton) happens to see Sydney talking to her ex-boyfriend, Tyler (Matt Long), she develops an immediate dislike of her.

Rachel decides to make the sorority rush a complete pain for Sydney  in the hopes that she'll back out and to push her away from Tyler.  Eventually, Rachel publicly humiliates Sydney and the tomboy finds her way to the Vortex, a home for collegiate outcasts.

From Sneezy to Grumpy, the seven outcasts that befriend Sydney have the seven dwarfs covered.  They agree to help Sydney take on the Greek system and Rachel and bring equality among the various groups on campus.

Although ""Sydney White"" is a very funny and enjoyable film, it never really separates itself from every other outcast film that's hit the screen.  The film is very reminiscent of ""Revenge of the Nerds.""  There's plenty of hokey humor, a tad bit of PG-13 sexual humor and some unexpected romance as well.

The cast is likeable.  Especially funny are Jeremy Howard and Adam Hendershott.  Crystal Hunt turns in a clever performance as Dinky, a fellow pledge that befriends Sydney.  John Schneider is also solid as Sydney's father.

Is ""Sydney White"" a keeper?  To a point, yes.  It is an enjoyable enough film that most people over the age of thirteen will enjoy it, but I wouldn't suggest you run out and buy it until you've watched it as a rental or on television first.",1237852800,,1727,4.876288659793815

Amanda Bynes stars as adorable tomboy Sydney White, a plumber's daughter who goes to a top college on scholarship and, because her late mother was a member, is a legacy to that school's most popular sorority.

Unfortunately, that sorority and the student council is run by the wicked Sara Paxton, who takes an instant dislike to Sydney and sabotages her chance to get into the Greek organization.

Virtually homeless on campus, Sydney is taken in by seven ""dorky"" guys who reside in a broken down house on campus that Paxton wants to have condemned.  Now, Sydney and the seven dorks devise a plan to unseat Paxton from her queenly position.

Joe Nussbaum directed this very likable movie, which co-stars Matt Long as the handsome ""Tyler Prince"".

DVD extras include deleted scenes, a gag reel and several ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

After being rejected and embrassed by a snobby Sorority Leader /class president she finds she can fit in else where with the forgiveness and help from the Dorks especially Lenny whom she played a sorority pranks on and others that are thought to be different.

That is until the fair Sydney White comes along and catches the eye of Witchburn's former boyfriend, Tyler Prince (Charming). The witch does everything she can to squash Ms. White; however, she underestimates the Power of Seven, when White takes up with the seven dorks in the quaint little house at the end of Greek Row.

Sydney White, a beautiful, motherless misfit is immediately winning as portrayed by Amanda Bynes, as she attempts to knock the Witch (Sara Paxton) off her elite throne in this good vs. evil tale. It's a clever and entertaining parallel to the fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. View it with your daughters, who will recognize and love the stars (and the music) and then take the time to point out all the Snow White references to one another. It was my younger daughter who pointed out the poisoned (i.e. hacked) Apple, which resulted in a deep sleep for White . . . but I recognized the kiss from Prince that brought her back.

Of course in this tale Snow White is named Sydney(Amanda Bynes) and she's on a mission to join her deceased mother's sorority, which is a far cry for a girl such as herself; being raised by all men construction workers with a love of comic books.

When the evil witch of the Kappas' Rachel Witchburn(Sara Paxton) deems Sydney 'non-kappa material' for flirting with her ex-boyfriend and Beta president Tyler(Matt Long) she sends her in the directions of the Vortex, the home of the seven dorks.

When Sydney learns that her mother's group of friends may not be the only answer to find happiness, everything begins to fall into place.

3287557,3,B0010X5X4Y,"I'm just going to start off by saying that this is not the kind of movie that I would pick to watch on my own time. It was my wife's night to pick which movie we were going to watch, and she had several from which to choose from; but when she saw that I had recently purchased ""Sydney White"" for her from our local video store she opted to watch it over all the other contenders. Personally, I had no opinion either way about this movie; I hadn't heard whether it was good, bad, etc.; so, I was pretty much open to whatever the movie had to offer, I just hoped it was at least a decent movie watching experience.

""Sydney White"" is the story of a young woman (Amanda Bynes) who is in her first year of college, and well, things aren't going as smoothly as she'd planned. After trying to get into an extremely popular sorority, she has found herself ostracized by those she had tried to fit in with and is now living with seven undeniably awkward and socially inept guys in a frat house that resembles more of an old-time, rundown home than your standard college campus fare usually does. As Sydney begins to evaluate her life, which has grown somewhat more complicated due to a burgeoning romance with a modern day prince (in her eyes) named Tyler (Matt Long), and her position on the social ladder of her school, she decides to take a chance and stand up for the outcasts and show the upper echelon of the college hierarchy that being popular isn't always about doing what is conventional or normal.

This movie, as you may have guessed already, is a modern day re-telling of the classic tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarves mixed with your typical coming-of-age comedy. Just like other comedies of this sub-genre, ""Sydney White"" is pretty standard stuff, without a whole lot of new ground being covered, so it's pretty easy to be able to predict exactly what's going to happen next and just how the story will most likely end. One difference that ""Sydney White"" does have from all the other entries in this grouping is the fact that it does mix in the fairy tale element of Snow White to shake the standard proceedings up just a bit. Granted you still know (or at least can make a really good educated guess) how the movie's going to end up, but with the references to the classic tale (both subtle and obvious) the movie manages to be elevated above its merely average status, which is quite rare for this genre.

Amanda Bynes (""She's the Man"") continues her streak of semi-offbeat comedies that manage to entertain her target audience without resorting to the crude jokes or sexual humor that tends to seep into every aspect of this genre. Amanda does another good job here, essentially playing the same character, or one very similar, to the sweet, funny, and sometimes awkward character she played in ""She's the Man""; except this time she doesn't have to dress up like a guy for half the movie. Matt Long as her love interest Tyler Prince (hmmm, I wonder which character from the fairy tale he could be) does a good job as your standard run-of-the-mill cool guy who has the quintessential heart of gold. In this movie, Matt is given an opportunity to show that he is a fairly well-rounded actor by trying his hand at comedy after his semi-dramatic (possibly over-dramatic at times) turn in the early portions of 2007's ""Ghost Rider"". Sara Paxton, who I vaguely remember from the oh-so forgettable spoof ""Superhero Movie"" is adequate as the modern day queen, but she proceeds to go to no effort at all to hide the fact that she is up to no good from the moment she first appears in the movie; the least she could have done was make us try to work for the relation to the fairy tale, not just beat us over the head with the obviousness. Regarding the cast members that portrayed the seven dorks (in this case), it was nice that the guys weren't always in your face with which one they were portraying; and in a few instances I actually had a hard time deciding who certain ones were supposed to be. Although, I bet if I would have been able to remember the various names of the dwarves in Disney's version of the story, I wouldn't have been as hard-pressed to figure out who was who. Lastly, it was nice to see veteran actor John Schneider playing the loving father (a role he perfected on TV's ""Smallville"") to Amanda Bynes' character. John doesn't appear a whole lot in the movie, but he manages to make the most out of what little he is given, and his appearances are most welcome when they occur, as they are essentially the only real dramatic aspects of the story.

Containing a decent amount of humor, some heart-warming moments, and neat references to the fairy tale on which the story is based, ""Sydney White"" is one of the few worthwhile efforts to come out of the sub-genre of coming-of-age comedies in the teen comedy category in quite some time. So, I would have to say that ""Sydney White"" is a movie that is at least worth watching once.

""Sydney White"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexual references.",1219968000,,5022,4.514285714285714

Sleepy was easy enough, but Dopey/Happy?, Doc/Sneezy?, Grumpy/Bashful? seamed to all have little traits of each dwarf, this probably worked for the better and gave it a fresher feel.

She winds up taking refuge at the Vortex, a student housing building where lives the guy she dumped for a sorority mission and his six bizarre roommates.

Honestly, I didn't think it would work. But it did, and besides the cuteness there is a little more moral meat as Sydney and her new friends lead a student body revolution. Yeah, it's cheesy and we've seen the revenge-of-the-nerds theme many a time before, but it's so goodhearted and fun that I couldn't help but love it, stereotypes, predictability, and all.

All the characters seemed very much into their roles. I wouldn't say I'm an Amanda Bynes fan, but she failed to annoy me this time around! It was a great blend of an old story with modern college life with clever, roll-your-eyes references to the original Disney animated film. It might bother some people, but as a Snow White fan I thought they were cute.

It's definitely a girl movie, I'll give you that, so if you can't put up with the silliness and the cheesiness, you will not enjoy it. But if you're a girl looking for a cute movie with a lot of harmless fun, this will hit the spot.

Not the most artistic of film making and not a whole lot of focus on in-depth characters and originality, but as a former teenage girl,I loved it for sheer sweetness, a good heart, and a passion for doing the right thing. Sometimes we just need that girly spunk.",1210377600,,1800,4.50920245398773
3287576,1,B0010X5X4Y,"I was forced to watch this movie, and was surprised to see people raving about how funny it is.  In a room full of people, not a single chuckle was heard as this movie played.  I have seen people have more fun at funerals.

The movie goes into the whole ""Mean Girls"" territory, a subject really needing no more exploration, with nothing clever to add.  It had something of the Snow White twist on it, but that really made it no more interesting and became a one-trick pony quickly.  If you are an obsessed fan of Snow White, you may get a little more out of it.  For the rest of us, you know how it's all going to play out from the first few minutes and it just drags on.  There's no energy, nothing clever.

Whether or not you are an Amanda Bynes fan, the script is so bland, not much can save it.  If you are a 12 to 14 year old female, you may be the target audience and really enjoy it, but otherwise few will see this whole movie all the way through.",1209427200,,955,4.064171122994653
3287577,5,B0010X5X4Y,"This movie is about a girl named Sydney White, (Amanda Bynes) who goes to college to follow in her mother's footsteps. Her mother was a legacy KAPA, (like the best sorority in the school). Her dad is a plumber and her mom died when she was just a little girl so she is a tomboy. Since her mom is a legacy KAPA she automatically gets to pledge. When Sydney White finds out her rival Rachael Witchburn, (Sara Paxton) won't let her be a KAPA because of a guy named Taylor Prince, she is crushed.
 After she is kicked out of the KAPA house, she has no place to live. She sits out on the street and starts to cry with it pouring down rain right in front of the vortex. (The vortex is a place where you go if u don't fit in) There is seven dorks/outsiders that live there. They see her out in the rain all alone and they ask her if she wants to live there. Living with seven dorks that are guys was her plan when first coming to this college, but she couldn't say no or she would be living on the streets. She makes them run against the Greeks in the student council election.
 I enjoyed this movie because it is funny and has a wonderful story line. I would give it two thumbs up! I think you would enjoy this movie if you liked movies with comedy and Amanda Bynes. If you have seen Accepted or John Tucker Must Die, and liked them, then you will probably like this movie.
 The moral or lesson to this movie is that everyone has a little bit of dork in them, even if everyone else thinks they're perfect, they're really not!
 So, will the dorks win student council or will the Greeks run the school forever? Will Sydney end up with Taylor Prince or will Rachael steal him away? You'll just have to watch this exciting and hilarious movie to find out!",1208217600,,1745,4.184523809523809
3287578,3,B0010X5X4Y,"Amanda Bynes mines Disney territory in this almost clever take on ""Snow White."" She stars as Sydney White, an awkward freshman who has just started college at her deceased mother's alma mater and is a sorority legacy. But witchy president Rachel Witchburn takes an immediate dislike to her when her ex-boyfriend Tyler shows interest in Snow, or rather Sydney. Rachel schemes to get Syd blackballed and her only option for housing is to bunk with the dwarfs, or rather the dorks down the road. Sydney soon dusts herself off and plots to get even with the duplicitous Rachel, while aiding her fellow dorks to be more hip.

I wanted to really like this movie - I loved the premise and the setting in a college campus, but the movie just drags and never really catches any momentum. Bynes character is so similar to Viola in ""She's the Man,"" that it's like she's doing an imitation of herself (and a poor one at that). It's an utterly forgettable movie that you're better off catching on cable provided you're already caught up on your laundry, which is a real shame since it had the potential to be so much more.

Unfortunately, the President hates her on sight for taking her ex-boyfriend and the war is on.

3287584,3,B0010X5X4Y,"This light-hearted teen film puts yet another twist in the Snow White fairy tale, with the cherubic teen queen of comedy (Amanda Bynes) in the lead role.

Well versed in the role of the underdog rising to a challenge, Bynes' character sets off to college to follow in her mother's footsteps, but finds the going rather Grimm.  The witch in this version is spelled with a ""b"", not necessarily for ""blonde"", and Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton of Aquamarine) is set on making Sydney's life a living hell.

Jealous that Sydney has become the apple of the eye of her ex-boyfriend Tyler Prince (Prince - get it?), Rachel engineers a scheme to publicly humiliate our heroine, which sends her deep into the black hole of the Vortex (a dilapidated campus building), where she meets seven antisocial dorks (!)  whose habits match up to the seven little guys in the original tale.

Never one to let a witch have her day, Sydney gives Rachel a dose of her own medicine, and the result is a teen comedy that's funny in places, but overdone in others.  It's okay, but no classic, and not one you'll want to ride off with into the sunset for your happily ever afters.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

1. Bynes shines, supporting cast not so much
2. Geeks take on Greeks
3. Brothers Grimm think: ""Hey! They turned our witch into a blonde!""
4. Gentlemen don't always prefer blondes
5. Good guys live geekily ever after

3287605,5,B0010X5X4Y,This movie was amazing. It really told about greek life that a lot of people do not know about. It did not only show the ba of the greek houses but the good as well. Just all in all it was the best movie that Amanda Bynes has starred in.,1203638400,,237,3.76
3287606,5,B0010X5X4Y,Has a great and fun cast - very enjoyable film!  Loved Amanda Byrnes such a great comedic actor.,1202860800,,96,4.333333333333333
3287607,4,B0010X5X4Y,"In a town and an industry where everyone just wants to be ""in,"" Amanda Bynes, like her title character in ""Sydney White,"" dares to stand out.

Amanda Bynes has certainly become the a-typical young Hollywood starlet in the past few years: she has not been photographed underage drinking at clubs; she has not gotten arrested or subsequently had to check into rehab; and perhaps mostly notably, she has embraced her young fans, delivering them consistently cheerful, cute, and simply inoffensive comedies.  Joe Nussbaum's ""Sydney White,"" a modern-day retelling of the classic Grimm fairytale, is another such example of Bynes' charismatic comedic ability to be one part trendy Mean Girl (but after she breaks the Spring Fling tiara apart) and one part modern day prat-fall queen ala Lucille Ball.  Her fearlessness to appear goofy amid droves of superficiality is refreshingly relatable, as she plays off her own inner dork in ""Sydney White.""

Nussbaum's version of a childhood classic has his heroine, Sydney (Bynes), entering college (the fictional Southern Atlantic University) with the sole directive of seeking out and pledging her late mother's sorority, Kappa Phi Nu, in order to give herself the fantastical college life she sees in her mother's old pictures.  Jealous that fraternity president Tyler Prince (the always charming Matt Long) has caught Sydney's eye and that Sydney is steadily climbing her way up the Hot Or Not? list, Kappa leader Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton) orders her blonde army of followers to ostracize the genuinely down-to-Earth brunette, despite her legacy.  Sydney seeks out refuge in the Vortex, the least popular frat on the Row, living with seven (slightly short) dorks, including one who refuses to talk unless it's through a puppet.  Very quickly, however, she learns she has much more in common with fellow comic book lovers than with the materialistic hyenas hell-bent on disbanding the Vortex and building their own house expansion in its place (a plot point that mixes ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with the upcoming ""I Know What Boys Like"" and thankfully manages to tell its story closer to the success of the former rather than the latter).  She and her sidekicks set out to dethrone Rachel and give back to all of the neglected activities and clubs that aren't a part of the Greek system.

Cinematographer Mark Irwin and editor Danny Saphire have worked together to create bright, saturated images, evoking the rich colors of the original Snow White's animation.  Bynes in particular seems to glow in this film, a thin halo of light reflecting off of her chestnut hair.  Upon first glance, it does look a bit odd, almost as if the image has not been compressed properly for a common television's specs.  However, as the film goes on, and that same light reflects the twinkle in Long's eye, it becomes apparent this was not a mistake but one of its attempts at stylization, just like the expositional voice over.

""Sydney White"" on DVD does not disappoint in the Bonus Features department, either, offering six deleted scenes with commentary from the director.  Surprisingly, these scenes are just as fun as the ones that actually made the cut.  A YouTube-worthy piece on the ""mascot"" Skoozer is sure to be a hit with the tween crowd, and a short gag reel gives the home viewers a quick behind-the-scenes look at what production was like on the ""Sydney White"" set.  The real gems, however, are the five featurettes that explore the characters and the actors who bring them to life.  ""Sydney and Her Prince"" is a five-minute look at the chemistry between Bynes and Long, both in and out of character. ""Meet The Dorks"" is exactly what it claims to be: an almost ten-minute piece on the actors who play Bynes' sidekicks, most notably Samm Levine and Danny Strong.  ""Kappas Forever"" introduces the audience to Sara Paxton and her minions (the sorority girls and Sydney's seeming-nemeses in the film), begging the question ""is this what sisterhood is really all about?""  ""Welcome To The Vortex"" is a five-minute tour of the boys' house; and finally, ""The Original Dork"" is a ""Making Of"" documentary where Nussbaum and the cast discuss his style and some tidbits from the filming of the movie.

""Sydney White"" is not unique in story nor message, especially when compared to Amanda Bynes' other work (""What A Girl Wants,"" ""She's The Man""), but it provides a fun, light-hearted ride for both those about to enter college and those who just got out nonetheless.",1201910400,,4490,4.985274431057563
3287608,4,B0010X5X4Y,This is a classic retelling of Snow white and the seven dwarfs in a college setting.  Sydney White (Bynes) leaves home to go off to college and plans on pledging the sorority of her late mother.  She finds that the sorority is not what she imagined and that she doesnt fit in.  She finds herself rooming in a house with 7 other outcasts.  She ends up helping them run for school council against the people that she didn't fit in with and who humiliated her.  A great movie about finding out who you really are and being happy with yourself.  It did have a drinking scene and a couple of bad words.  Also had a reference to homosexuals which was in a scene about reaching out to everyone to get their vote for student council.,1201824000,,725,4.325925925925926
3287609,3,B0010X5X4Y,"For those who are fans of Amanda Bynes, we have come to expect (what I would characterize as) quality ""teen movies"" from her.  I was a huge fan of both ""She's The Man"" and ""What a Girl Wants,"" so naturally when this came out I had to get it!

The movie tells the story of Sydney White, a girl whose mother died when she was young.  Subsequently, her father raised her and introduced her to the men's side of life, rather than girls, gossip, makeup and (of course) boys.  When Sydney goes away to college she pledges at the same sorority that her mother pledged at when she was in college.  When the current president of the sorority takes a disliking to Sydney and has her pledge pass revoked because of silly customs, Sydney takes action.  Not only does she move down the ""Greek Row"" to the Vortex (a house for people who have no where else to go), but she helps its current occupants to be strong, learn to live and have some fun.  Sydney soon learns that it is better to be the kind of person her mother was than to simply do things based on tradition/memories of her mother.

Although I did not think that this was as good as the other Amanda B. movies I mentioned up top, I still think it is a great movie.  If you want something fun and entertaining to watch this is a great movie to choose.  Bynes is charming as usual and you will definitely enjoy her!!",1201651200,,1361,4.260700389105058
3287610,4,B0010X5X4Y,"This is an enjoyable comedy, but it's not for those who prefer more artful scripts and acting. While the plot is a familiar one, the performances of Amanda Bynes (Sydney), Sara Paxton (Rachel), and Crystal Hunt (Dinky) provide the right mix of contrasting characters for this predictable young adult romantic comedy/farce.  The ""Revenge of the DORKS"" subplot adds some feel-good silliness.",1201564800,,389,5.377049180327869

Now to the matter at hand, the '07 film `Sydney White' is Amanda doing what she does best; starting off on a new adventure on her own (this time going away to college), falling in love with campus the hottie (Matt Long), battling his ex-girlfriend and resident sorority b*t*h (Sara Paxton) and almost single-handedly changing the inequities of university social life. That girl can do just about anything!

There's not a lot new here (OK nothing) in terms of storyline but the production values are excellent and the cast outstanding. All that and Amanda too! What more could anyone ask for?

3287612,4,B0010X5X4Y,"I think Amanda Bynes is hilarious. I think she's probably the best comedic actress in her age range today. But this movie was a little light on the humor. And what humor it did have, was mainly given to the seven dorks. Jokes like the ""hi ho"" moment were very funny but they weren't her jokes. I think Amanda was under used in this movie. I much prefer ""She's the Man"" or even her sitcom ""What I like about you""",1201219200,,411,4.15
3287613,4,B0010X5X4Y,"Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) is a modern day adaptation of the timeless fairytale Snow White. In this instance, our heroine is a college student away from home for the 1st time. She is rejected by the sorority that was her deceased mother's alma mater and finds herself instantly homeless and a social outcast. With nowhere else to go, she ends up at ""The Vortex"" (the campus house that is infamous for sucking up all the losers). She is taken in by the seven dorks that live there and the laughs begin in earnest. In many ways it's like Snow White meets Revenge of the Nerds.
  The other cast members include John Schneider (Sydney's father), Matt Long (Tyler Prince- Sydney's love interest), Sara Paxton (Sorority Leader & student council president- Rachel Witchburn), Jack Carpenter (Lenny- the head ""dork""), Jeremy Howard (Terrence Lubinecki- the dork that dares to run for student council president against Rachel).
  While it is totally predictable, it is still worth watching if you are in the mood for something light and frivolous. Amanda Bynes once again shows her talent at comedic timing and proves that she really is a decent actress. It is rated PG-13 for some language, sexual humor and college partying. I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers but think the preteen to younger teens will find it utterly delightful.",1201132800,,1334,4.941964285714286
3287614,5,B0010X5X4Y,"My family and I watched this together and we all loved it!  Such a fun movie!  I loved the similarities with Snow White.  The actor who portrayed ""Dopey"" was hilarious, as was the dog puppet!",1201046400,,191,4.4
3287625,5,B0010X5X4Y,"It's movies like this that the high-power film reviewers love tearing to shreds for their alleged lack of originality, and in a society where quirky comedies such as ""Waitress"" and ""Juno"" (the types of movies that Ebert and the others love to eat right up), perhaps we won't be seeing the more basic chick flicks at the next Academy Awards show. Setting all that aside, it doesn't take a genius to know that the opinions of the general public make a difference too, and if you're the kind of person who loves a sweet, deliciously cheesy chick flick with a nice moral behind it, you're going to love ""Sydney White."" The bottom line is that it all comes down to formula, and with comedic pro Amanda Bynes leading the way, there is plenty to love about this modern update of the age-old tale about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""

""Sydney White"" tells the story of an 18-year-old high school graduate who, after being raised by her widowed father, is ready to experience college for the first time. Joining a top-notch sorority at her chosen university may not seem to fit right with Sydney's unique, non-conforming personality, but in this case, it's her own way of connecting with her deceased mother. Once there, trouble lurks with Kappa queen Rachel Witchburn, and if you are a female, you know all about what happens when a petty little high school/college girl decides she doesn't like you. From there, it's up to Sydney to find another way to make the most out of college, and when she befriends seven dorky guys from outside the general social circle, she may find more than her original plan could have offered her.

Again, Amanda Bynes has firmly established her sweet, genuine, and widely effervescent personality with films such as ""What a Girl Wants"" and ""Hairspray,"" and perhaps most notably, her lead role in the hugely entertaining (and sadly short-lived) TV series ""What I Like About You."" Her role in this film doesn't break the mold from what she's done in the past, but it is true proof that Bynes knows what's she's good at, and there's no doubt that her loyal fan base will love her in this movie. As another reviewer has indicated, Bynes is easily one of the most underrated young star of her generation, but for those who appreciate her most, her films never disappoint. Her characters always have a good moral behind them, and I give the girl major props for keeping her head on straight in a society where it would be so easy for a star her age to go the other way. With her character Sydney, she does a nice job of showing that there's more to college than being a popular sorority girl. Still, before you assume that it's just another slam on contemporary Greek life, rest assured that the underlying message is about using your college experiences to do what makes you happy and maybe even help others along the way, no matter what it is.

Matt Long and Sara Paxton also turn in fun performances, if not a bit clichd, but most people who go to see this movie in the first place won't mind that too much. They had to take on the age-old roles of the Prince Charming and Wicked Witch, but both managed to keep it completely lighthearted and enjoyable. Some have said that Paxton was not convincing enough, but I thought she nailed that ""evil eye"" and the nasty, b*tchy exterior perfectly, and Long had terrific chemistry with Bynes. I have to admit that I have never seen a guy serenade a girl with roses and a line of fraternity singers in a library (although it would be quite nice to experience), but if that scene annoys you, then you were probably never interested in the standard chick flick, anyway. Movies like this are supposed to entertain and provide a brief retreat from reality, so it's not really worth it to argue the plausibility of these things.

The Seven Dorks are also a delight (of the seven original characters, I noted Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, and Sleepy), and another unexpected gem is Crystal Hunt, whose name in the film (Dinky) is more than enough to describe her personality. Some might be annoyed by her, I guess, but as for me, she was a genuine scene-stealer who made me laugh every time she came on screen.

My only gripe with this overall successful and enjoyable movie is that as much as Amanda Bynes wants to gain some respect as a dramatic actress, I think she may be better off sticking with the comedy. I don't mean to be critical, because she truly is one of my favorite young actresses (not to mention a true class act compared to certain others), but she had a few emotional scenes here that called on her to cry and put on a pouty face, and I just could not buy into it. Maybe it's just that Bynes has established herself as a goofy, off-the-wall comedienne since she was about 9 years old, but she seemed to be trying way too hard with the drama. Perhaps she will improve with that as she gets older and takes on different types of roles, but again, Bynes is a born natural with comedy, and I hope she never strays from that.

Anyway, now that this is on DVD, it is a perfect movie to rent on a Saturday night and enjoy with some popcorn and good friends. If this is your kind of flick, then you know who you are, and the predictable, slightly corny plot will not bother you a bit (and in fact, it's exactly what makes it good!)",1200960000,,5293,4.508333333333334

3287627,2,B0010X5X4Y,"Presently mired in infantile dreck like ""Sydney White"", the hugely talented Amanda Bynes must be counting down the days to 2011, when she will receive her first of two Oscars for Best Actress. Gazing in my crystal ball here, I see that in 2010 Amanda will have a small role in a Woody Allen film that consists of little more than Woody's inane musings. Her role, however however minuscule, prompts studios other than Disney to start taking her seriously, and she is offered a lead role opposite Jude Law in a gripping, heart-wrenching drama. The following February, she is standing onstage at the Kodak Theatre, having beat out Keira Knightley, Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench and Mary-Kate Olsen (don't ask). Until that glorious day, however, we are forced to watch our favourite actress attempting to slog through poorly-written, cliche-laden nonsense like ""Sydney White."" Although our Amanda gives it her usual 110%, the premise and script are so poor she might as well not have bothered. Seeing her in this film is like watching somebody attempt to go off-roading in a Rolls-Royce. A horrible, jaw-clenching waste. So in short, if you're an Amanda fan, skip this one, if you're Amanda, when Woody calls, pick up the phone on the first ring.",1200614400,,1239,4.9330143540669855

3287630,5,B0010X5X4Y,"Ok, I love Amanda Bynes.  She's hilarious, and has great comedic timing.  I randomly saw a trailer for this movie and immediately knew I had to see it.  And I'm so glad I did.  Based loosely off of the Snow White fairy tale, Amanda's character, Sydney White, goes off to her dead mom's alma mater college and pledges with her mom's old sorority.  The head of that sorority, doesn't like Sydney though, and after a whole list of horrible pledge hazing, Sydney is publicly humiliated at the initiation ceremony.  Left with no where to live (she had expected to live at the sorority house), she moves in with a bunch of nerdy guys in a horribly run-down house in the middle of all the other Greek houses.  The evil sorority president wants to tear down this house for another Greek building, donated by her father, so the rest of the movie Sydney and her 7 geeks are trying to get back at her.  This movie is not just for the sorority girls though, if you're a geeky girl like me you'll have plenty of inside jokes to laugh at.  Especially about Admiral Adama, the possible cylon?
I highly recommend Sydney White, go out and see it or buy it on DVD when it comes out, like me!",1193616000,,1173,4.368663594470046
3287631,4,B0010X5X4Y,"Sydney White is a modern-day Snow White whose story unfolds on the campus of the college her deceased mother attended.  Sydney is a legacy pledge for her mother's sorority, but circumstances prevent her from becoming a ""sister"".  Instead, Sydney moves in with the ""Seven Dorks"" of ""The Vortex"" - the house that sucks in all of the losers!  These actors had me in tears because I was laughing so hard!  Each one beautifully portrayed one of the fairy tale dwarf personas.  The charming Prince (Matt Long, ""Ghost Rider"") even awakens the sleeping princess with a kiss.

Amanda Bynes was her usual comical self.  John Schneider is always a welcome addition to any screen.  Sara Paxton is outstanding as Rachel Witchburn.  Crystal Hunt, Jack Carpenter, Jeremy Howard, Adam Hendershott, Danny Strong, Samm Levine, Donte Bonner are an outstanding supporting cast.  Arnie Pantoja steals the show as the ""Dopey""-est dork!

3287632,4,B0010X5X4Y,"Ever since she lost her mother when she was 9, Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) has been raised by her father (John Schneider). Eventually, she became one of the guys working with construction and plumbing. Her lifestyle changes when she's accepted to Southern Atlantic University, where she joins Kappa Pheta Nu, a sorority that her mother was formerly part of. However, it doesn't suit well for egotistical president Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton), and a chain of events sends her to the Vortex, where she befriends seven dorks (Donte Bonner, Jack Carpenter, Adam Hendershott, Jeremy Howard, Samm Levine, Arnie Pantoja, Danny Strong). And with the help of frat boy Tyler Prince (Matt Long), she and the dorks campaign to take over student government.

Somewhere in the midst of teen queens like Miley Cyrus, Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, the Olsen Twins, and Hayden Panatierre, Amanda Bynes easily the most underrated. Originally part of the ""All That"" sketch show, Bynes is a rare talent who is quite attractive and willing to throw herself into comedic situations without embarassing herself. Think of Jenny McCarthy for the tween set. Yeah, call me a homo, but I love the gal.

Too bad her movies don't fare well. Aside from mainstream releases like ""Robots"" and the screen adaptation of the musical ""Hairspray"" (an overrated piece of garbage with Brittany Snow making me want to gouge my eyes out, though the rest of the cast at least made it palapable), Bynes never has much luck with leading lady movies. Admittedly, they're not works of art, but compared to the estrogen-loaded films out there (such as this year's ""Bratz""), at least I can go in there and not feel dirty. On that, here's Bynes' latest, ""Sydney White"".

An innocently directed film by Joe Nussbaum (""American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile""), at least ""Sydney"" is willing to throw in a good amount of irreverence to keep it from giving into chick flick cliches. Nussbaum invites plenty of material for the guys to get into, including some girls with skimpy swimwear, a love interest given plenty of life thanks to Matt Long's (last seen in ""Ghost Rider"") confident performance, references to Star Wars and popular video games (""Medal of Honor"" and ""God of War"" are the many titles referenced that are melded into a single video game), and enjoyable takes on cliched characterizations (MySpace users, emos, virgins, etc). Mind you, it's not original material, and the soundtrack is typical teen pop (look out for Dashboard Confessional and Jesse McCartney tracks), but compared to ""Bratz"" (which I haven't seen), it won't bash your head and lower your IQ's.

Besides, who can go wrong with an appearance from Bo Duke himself, John Schneider?

Bynes is complimented with a pretty good side cast, especially newcomer Crystal Hunt. A veteran of the daytime soap opera ""Guiding Light"", Hunt trades in melodrama with a nice performance as one of Sydney's best friend. Hey, if it worked for Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Passions"" to ""Sky High""), it'll do gangbusters for Hunt. The dorks are newcomers (except for ""The Hills Have Eyes 2006"" Samm Levine), but unlike today's batch of indistinguishable actors, they're full of fun and get a share of laughs.

The only weak link is Sara Paxton. Rachel is written as a take-no-prisoners villain, and a reimagining of the Snow White witch, but Paxton is a kitten going against a wild lion. It's not a terrible performance, and she can rock a mean bikini, but I could name a bunch of other actresses who could dive into the role of Rachel and let the venom circulate. Hell, even Paxton's screaming fits aren't funny, they're just annoying.

Aside from that, the rest of the film is enjoyable without being cloying. Sure, the film tries to go Adam Sandler and try to end the film with a message of acceptance. But like ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"", the film is so endearingly lovable that the message is able to sink in with the comedy bits. Sadly, this film will disappear off the radar in the coming weeks. But I'll take Amanda Bynes over the crop of today's overrated tween princesses. Any single day.",1190937600,,4110,4.905035971223022
3287633,4,B0010X5X4Y,"As I watched this latest Amanda Bynes film it struck me that the plot is a cross between Snow White and Revenge of the Nerds.  Bynes, one of the funniest teen actresses since Patty Duke, plays a girl pledged to a sorority that her late mother belonged to.  But she doesn't fit in with the snobs and gets kicked out, so she lives with seven nerds, or dorks.  They help her prepare for a date, and in return she helps them campaign for student council against the popular sorority and fraternity kids that have been ruling the campus for decades.  Bynes is very funny, the story is good (based on Snow White), and the comedy is almost entirely suitable for the whole family - but still very funny.  John Schneider (Smallville) plays her father.",1190419200,,742,4.507462686567164

I am all for a cheesy teen-flick (a-la Mean Girls, She's All that, 10 Things I Hate About You) but this was horrendous. Instead of presenting the dull and repetitive plot in a comedic/satirical light, it was literal. The stereotypes were painful to watch, the characters themselves didn't even stick to their traits long enough for you to sympathize or feel anything but irritation. We get it... the blonde preppy girl owns the school, the nerds are socially inept and somehow also mentally handicapped, the female protagonist overcomes adversity(?) to ""save the nerds!"" The acting was atrocious, I'm still not sure why Bynes was 10 shades more orange than the blonde Barbie types. As someone who frequently puts these types of movies on while cleaning or doing laundry, I can confidently say it's not even decent enough to have on as background noise.",1513987200,,1008,4.832369942196531
