Even though it doesn't give specific information on poses addressing menopause symptoms, I felt the results of doing the class speak for themselves. I'll continue to practice my personal yoga with this DVD. Its great!",1434326400,,323,5.0
8376764,1,B0001CNPZ4,"This is just a regular yoga practice, not at all what it purports to be by the title. There is a surprising lack of useful information about women's health and hormones, and how various poses are of benefit to women. This yoga routine probably requires more energy than many perimenopausal or menopausal women have, if they haven't been treating their symptoms which can include flat out exhaustion. Far more useful is Kathy Smith's ""Moving Through Menopause"" DVD/video, which is packed with a huge amount of helpful information and interviews with various experts on the many ways of healing, as well as a wonderful restorative yoga routine and other added features. Unfortunately I bought this prior to hearing about ""Moving Through Menopause"". Don't waste your money on this one.",1143849600,5,782,5.1171875

8376766,4,B0001CNPZ4,"I agree that the video doesn't provide any real information about the benefits of yoga for menopausal symptoms.  However, I did find the video a very accessable introduction to yoga and Susan Winter Ward to be a very soothing, easy instructor to follow.  I liked the video enough to continue using it regularly (I've never stuck with any other yoga tape I've tried) and to purchase another of her ""Young at Heart"" series.  I alternate between the two and am looking to buy a third to vary the routine.  Menopausal or not, if you're looking for a pleasant yoga tape I would highly recommend this one.",1121644800,4,599,4.622641509433962
