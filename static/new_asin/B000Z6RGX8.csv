8234853,2,B000Z6RGX8,"The author did not once go into detail regarding the different genotypes of Hep C.....these different genotypes are the most important thing about HepC.....regarding...treatment, how a person feels physically, emotionally, etc......and she did not give very much info on how harmful the combination interferon treatment is during and after.  She did not reveal how infected people would line up to sell their blood/plasma at these centers and then turn around sending it off to the hospitals to be used on people who were not infected.....also how pharmaceutical companies are making big bucks by you not getting cured.  Why didn't she show some people who have the worst genotype and how awful they look!  I would not purchase this dvd, but would go online and do research about it on my own.  She made everything seem so flowery and rainbowey in my opinion.....I have chronic hep c myself genotype 1a, and I have been battling this thing for years, not to mention draining my wallet.....the internet is the best way to go instead of this dvd if you want real information!",1383782400,3,1073,4.944444444444445

8234855,2,B000Z6RGX8,"This so called ""documentary"" is really a sub-par piece of advocacy for more government funding on hepatitis C.  Can be viewed for ""free"" from many online sources such as N*tflix, and definitely not worth $10+.",1216771200,,209,4.9714285714285715
