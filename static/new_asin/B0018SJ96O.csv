3420853,5,B0018SJ96O,"This is what a movie should be, a great story and lots of action! I thought the acting was decent and this movie brings american culture to martial arts of the east!! I highly recommend.",1210204800,5,186,4.3428571428571425
8271020,2,B0018SJ96O,This is a decent independent film with a decent story line. Only issues I had with the film was sound and footage. This film looks like it was shot using different cameras. The martial arts was top notch. If this film was to come on cable I would watch it.,1218326400,,256,4.14
8271021,4,B0018SJ96O,"Full Circle is the ultimate seasonal flick.  It's get all the ussual wholesome ingredients.  Good story, Good fight scene and nice special effects for a low budget film.  I really appreciate the fact  the Full Circle has a lot of local actors and exceptionaly acted by a non pro cast.  I did like a few of the performances Al Ghanekar, Dave Ehrman, Michelle Mirpour and June Daguiso has a movie star quality and doesn't dissappoint.  The rest of the cast did a great job potraying thier roles.  Full Circle does not presume to become anything more.  It is what it is.  What goes around comes around in Full Circle.  I give a solid recommendation as one of the best in its genre.  I had a really good time watching familiar faces.  I will watch it again and again.  I cannot leave this review with-out admitting to my high regards for June Daguiso a Writer, Producer, Director.  That is so hard to do even for an Independant film.  I can't wait to see his next film",1212364800,,964,4.428571428571429
8271022,5,B0018SJ96O,"Just popped this sucker in yesterday afternoon.

It definitely had a low budget ""look "" as I expected, but I give these guys mad kudos for having the guts to create something like this as beginners.  Money can't make a good story, and this is definitely a very very good story.  I like the sub-plot of marko and his son not getting along.  My girlfriend and her mom cried their eyes out when they saw the death scene.  i ain't givin it away...but it's really well done.

there's definitly some things that need improvement (lighting, sound polishing), but I think that Mr. Sullivan's ignorant review below is just way over the top with his abrasive comments. It's probably the other way around from what he said. He prolly knows the protagonist and has some personal vendetta with the director.

Although I know nothing about making movies, i watch a good share of low budgets, and feel that many of them are too ""safe"".  They take place in one or two rooms, or are only based on dialog.

full circle, really must have taken some balls to create. It's the first low budget film I've seen that had good actors who look like real martial artists!  Normally it's one or the other.  Also, the visual effects are very well done.

if full circle had 50 mill attached to it and a couple A-listers, it would be a blockbuster hit, no doubt.",1211328000,,1331,4.5
8271023,1,B0018SJ96O,"I love independent films. I've even helped work on one as a language coach and fight choreographer. I've seen truly inspired independent films with super low budgets of $10,000 or less. This film is simply terrible.

Despite a couple of decent actors thrown into the mix, the majority of the characters (including the protagonist) couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The story is pathetically contrived, and the action was so bad it caused me physical pain. At least they parked within a couple miles of realism in that the taekwondo guy spends 10 minutes beating on the cop, who then uses two simple strikes to take the guy out. As a martial artist myself (who has trained with cops), I can vouch for that part.

The picture quality is a bit low, as I would expect from an independent film. This doesn't really hurt the film at all. The sound, on the other hand, is pathetic. The contrived ""See Spot Run"" dialog is so badly muffled throughout the movie that you have to crank the sound way up. When music or sound effects hit, however, your whole house shakes. A simple trip through my computer could fix that problem -- it's not expensive. They are just amateurs who didn't care. What's more, I've only seen the first 2/3rds of the movie; I simply can't keep watching it.

I don't want to discourage independent films. I just want to discourage people from buying this one. A bunch of characters from the film and friends of the film-maker reviewed this movie with 5 stars to trick people like me into buying it. I'm writing this review to prevent you from making the same mistake. If I could give it negative stars, I would! In the mean time, I want my money back.",1211155200,2,1674,4.518151815181518
8271024,5,B0018SJ96O,"I've watched a lot of Independent films. But I've never seen one with such a great story line as this one. If this movie was produced with a Hollywood budget, this one would be a big seller! Great directing.  I really liked the actors. Fantastic job!  I watched it three times the day I bought it. One of my friends came over and saw the cool cover of the dvd and kept bugging me to watch it. Even though it was 11:30pm.  I recommend this movie to anyone. Especially if you like martial arts and urban lifestyle. These guys know how to make bad guys glamorous fighters.",1210723200,,569,4.299065420560748
8271025,5,B0018SJ96O,"Great suspenseful, action-packed story with all of the plots and twists of a major blockbuster.  Who can you trust, who will betray you, and what comes around goes around?! And the main character, Marco Santini, is definitely one that will become an American icon in the near future. Looking forward to a sequel!",1210550400,,312,4.886792452830188
8271026,5,B0018SJ96O,"I am a huge fan of independant films, especially martial arts films. Its kinda like, College football those guys play there hearts out hoping to make it the pros. Thats what this film is, a pull no punches hardcore action flick built around heart and determination to give the viewer a great experience and hoping to go pro. I like the story, I liked the acting the screen quality could have been better, but Its an indy they didn't have a million dollar camera to get the good quality picture. Overall I am glad I bought this it was an enjoyable two hour ride!",1210291200,2,561,4.403846153846154
8271027,5,B0018SJ96O,"Smarts and Outstanding visual effects for a low budget film.  What amazes me, is the writer, Producer, Director and the male lead role is the same person. The story is simple. but,there's no doubt that it also keeps you watching all the way to the end.  Tony (Al Ghanekar) makes a great villain.  He's such a relaxed, affable presence and natural.  Marco Santini (June Daguiso) is perfect for the role.  There's so many talented actors in this low budget film and with June Daguiso's ability to come up with such a good crime syndicate, Police action/Drama, no doubt that his next film will also be a big hit.

Full Circle is is energetic and warmth- heart enough to become a word-of-mouth hit.  This movie is really tight.  I enjoyed it a lot.",1210291200,3,744,4.583333333333333
8271028,5,B0018SJ96O,"An enjoyable, loud and relentless action film exploring police corruption!  Influenced by Noir realism along with some ideas from Asian martial arts films, Full Circle is a new take on the police/crime thriller genre.  This is an entertaining urban action & martial arts film which doesn't try to be something else.  Yet its realist view of morality is unmistakable -- no clear or conventional lines between right and wrong.  The corrosive effects of undercover police work and the need to bloody one's hands in fighting crime also come through.

The film's multi-ethnic cast does a good job, with some stand-out performances.
It will be interesting to see where new film-maker June Daguiso goes next with his bold, original takes on recurring themes of right vs. wrong, crime, the pull of violence and the dark hearts of men.",1210204800,7,826,5.0
8271029,5,B0018SJ96O,"My boyfriend loves martial arts movies, I liked the cover of this one and the description and bought it. I was unaware it was an independent film until I looked at my boyfriends disappointed face. But we watched it anyway and he absoloutley LOVED IT! thank God. I actually enjoyed it myself. So I guess I highly recommend!",1210204800,5,322,4.568965517241379
