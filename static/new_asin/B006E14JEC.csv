8496807,1,B006E14JEC,"This product was advertised as an instructional video, that is why I bought it for my wife, to replace the one she has but is pretty worn out. It however, was an advertising video to sell the product with only demonstrations of the product usage. There was no workout instruction at all which is what I thought I was buying for her. It is totally useless and a huge disappointment to both of us, a waste of money. I would like to have our money refunded and I will gladly return the tape to a provided address.",1464998400,,510,4.268041237113402
