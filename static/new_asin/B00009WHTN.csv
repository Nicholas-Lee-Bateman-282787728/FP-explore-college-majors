7993718,5,B00009WHTN,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Sango the demon slayer teams up with Inuyasha and the gang to hunt Naraku and the Jewel. Naraku has destroyed her life, and she wants revenge. While searching for answers the others learn from Sango where the Jewel came from.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1371,4.393700787401575
7993719,5,B00009WHTN,"Tricked into believing that Inuyasha is responsible for destroying her village and killing all her people, Sango vows to kill him. And there's Naraku himself to deal with also. We also learn about the origin of the Sacred Jewel in the second episode. Episode 27 is a stand-alone story in which Inuyasha and his friends come across a village procession for a human sacrifice to an Evil Water God. Of course, our heroes cannot let this stand and are helped in their quest by the headman's young son.

There's a little danger starting to creep in on this show that maybe there are too many characters. Hopefully, Sango will be the last major ally to be introduced because it risks diluting the chemistry that has been built up to this point. Still, maybe it's just because I'm not used to her in the mix yet. I also enjoyed the last episode because it gives you a breather from all the deep emotions of the past few shows. Another danger that this anime runs is becoming a ""monster of the week"" event which is cliched and formulaic. I hope that I never feel that way about it though and that it will keep surprising me. As always, the dinky extras are here: line art and Japanese promotion ads. It seems like Viz could have done a better job in the extras department.",1122768000,,1264,4.471861471861472
7993720,5,B00009WHTN,"Inuyasha: Origin of the Sacred Jewel contains episodes 25-27 of Rumiko Takahashi's very long, and still in production at the time of this review, anime/manga series. Inuyasha (""dog-demon"")is a young, brash hanyou (""half-demon"") living in feudal Japan. His father was a powerful dog-demon, his mother a beautiful, high-class lady. Inuyasha wants to be a full demon. He is after the Sacred Jewel (""Shikon no Tama"") that will help him achieve this.

Kagome Higurashi is a 15 year-old girl who lives in a temple with her mother, younger brother, and grandfather. Her grandfather tries to interest her in ancient stories of demons and the history of the temple, but Kagome is bored. Her attitude changes when she is pulled down a well by a female centipede-demon. Kagome is hurled into feudal Japan, where she meets Inuyasha.

Episode 25 - ""Naraku's Insidious Plot"" - Sango is on a mission of revenge which will surely kill her because she is so badly injured after being attacked by her little brother Kohaku.  Sango wants to kill Inuyasha because she believes Naraku's story that it was the hanyou that wiped out her entire village.  Naraku lends her a sacred jewel fragment to help the Demon Hunter fight her last battle.

This episode is pivotal to watch because we finally see the horrible dual nature of Naraku.  Nowhere else in the series is this clarified exactly as it is here.

Episode 26 ""Secret of the Jewel of Four Souls: Revealed"" - One of the best Inu eps ever.  This is the origin of the Shikon no Tama!!!  Why and how it was created!! One of the most wonderful, beautiful, and memorable characters makes her debut here, but alas, she is never shown in the series again!!!  Such a deeply touching episode.  A very important secret (tearjerker) is revealed about Sango's feline demon Kilala.

Episode 27 - ""The Lake of the Evil Water God"" - Inuyasha and his friends battle a powerful water god to save a village and its children, whom the god is demanding as a sacrifice.",1112227200,3,1981,4.760233918128655

7993722,4,B00009WHTN,"These three episodes (25, 26, and 27) are good but a bit disjointed.  Episode 25 is the best, although as is typical you can't fully appreciate it unless you have seen the last disk.  It's kind of a ""part two"" of a plot by the main villain, Naraku.
Episode 26 is slow and overly complicated, not to mention ""lost in translation"" I suspect.  It adds a layer to the whole story of the Sacred Jewel that just wasn't needed imo.  Instead of trying to *explain* what a ""jewel of four souls"" was they should have just left things open ended.
Episode 27 is one of the most disposable of the series, a detour to fight a very minor demon with no connection to the larger plot-line.  About all the episode does is integrate Sango into the main group a bit, rather than having her as an outsider of the ""guest star"" variety.
Extras are the typical ones:  line art, short japanese promos, cast list.  Cover art continues the now very tired trend of (1) open-mouthed ""angry"" Inu Yasha, (2) open-mouthed ""helpless"" Kagome, and (3) one other character (this time, Sango).",1081123200,2,1056,4.526315789473684
