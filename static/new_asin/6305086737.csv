963029,5,6305086737,Milo was a very good scary movie! I hadn't heard anything about it so I wasn't expecting anything. But it turned out to be very worthwhile! I recommend this to any scary movie-goers! It's very interesting and you won't find yourself sitting all alone in the dark watching this one!,976924800,3,281,4.64
963030,1,6305086737,"With all the good horror movies that have been done, you'd think by now people wouldn't make movies like this.  Milo is uninteresting, hokey, and down-right boring.  The only scary thing about this movie is that someone actually gave people money to make it.  Since 1 star is the lowest I can give, the producers of Milo owe me a star.",973987200,5,335,4.459016393442623

I just wished the whole deal  with Milo was explained better. Is he a ghost? Zombie? Vampire? it also  needed more death scenes to make it more memorable. I suggest you rent it  first,then buy it if you want it in your home.",934502400,2,414,4.6438356164383565
963034,5,6305086737,"I thought that the plot of a boy never growing up and still tormenting a group of girls was genius.  The thing that I thought was actually the best part of the movie was Milo's voice.  His voice made him sound freaky.  This  is one of the best movies that I have seen this year.  It ranks with  Shadowbuilder, Urban Legend, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  Excellent.",921110400,3,378,4.23943661971831

963133,1,6305086737,"This movie has a very poor representation of PTSD, mental health issues and worse has some of the most intolerable acting I have ever seen. The story is disjoint and it is hard to suspend disbelief to even take this movie seriously.",1435708800,,232,4.5476190476190474

963206,5,6305086737,"You cannot go into this movie thinking it is going to be the next great masterpiece. But if you go into it for sheer enjoyment value you won't be disappointed. Another great plus is seeing a very young and adorable Mila Kunis as one of the little school children. Sadly, Milo follows the same premise as many movies from that time frame. Group of friends involved in tragedy, grow up, come home and get picked off one by one by an evil force which in this case manifests itself as a little boy they grew up with.

The way Milo speaks is a bit hokey and some of the effects might not be on par for what we watch now. but for just a good spook movie, just to watch and enjoy I would recommend Milo any day of the week.

Thank you Amazon for finding a hidden gem. Now to just get I, Madman and my life will be complete.

963209,1,6305086737,"I wanted them to hurry up and kill the character, Claire.  It was so drawn out.  A little boy trying to create a wife?  How many attempts to kill this kid was almost humorous.  The story was boring, along with most of it's cast members.  The creepy father played his part okay.  Antonio Fargas, acting was okay as well.

963214,3,6305086737,"After a horrific childhood flash-back sequence, involving a group of young schoolgirls and a murderous boy in a yellow raincoat, we are introduced to the adult Claire Mullins (Jennifer Jostyn). She takes a teaching job in her old elementary school. Claire soon begins to see a boy in a yellow raincoat lurking about! Has he somehow returned to torment her? This would be quite odd since we learn that MILO drowned years earlier! Oh no! Claire's childhood friends start dying in horrible, bloody ways! Yep, it appears that MILO is back from the grave, intent on killing those who were there all those years ago! MILO is a somewhat macabre, yet ultimately silly movie. I'm not sure if the filmmakers were going for a DON'T LOOK NOW / THE BROOD thing w/ the raincoat, but it comes off as more humorous than frightening. MILO just isn't all that intimidating! It doesn't help that his voice sounds like Bugs Bunny on helium! Claire's increasing neurosis is rather comical as well. She comes across as delirious from the beginning. Antonio Fargas co-stars as the world's most unlucky janitor. His death at the tiny hands of MILO is brilliant in its absurdity! The head-bashing, utterly bananas, Claire vs. MILO finale (almost) makes up for the rest of the movie. It's hard to top a woman in half a wedding dress swinging a baseball bat at a mutant child armed w/ a scalpel! This movie misses being an all-out laugh riot due to its abortion-gone-mad subplot, and overall tedium. Alas...",1375747200,,1480,4.78515625

Milo is part of BOOGYMAN history! The trailer is also included which to me is awesome because I LOVE movie trailers. This one was cool! If you are a BIG movie/HORROR fan like me, GET THIS MOVIE MILO!

I rate it as high as you rate a scary movie I would watch it day and night every night because it was really good and I buy movies all the time and it is one that you should watch and buy You will really enjoy it. I thought it was sad how are them children treated him and done him when he was younger and I still think it is one of the best scariest movies I have ever watched and I hope they will make a second movie of it because I would buy and watch it everyday too thank you.",1130284800,3,675,3.898550724637681

963291,1,6305086737,"This is one of worst films I've ever seen.  It's plot is stupid, it is very pretictable, the acting sucks, and the ending is the worst ending for a movie I've seen in years.  If this movie was on sale for 5 cents, and it was the only movie in the store, and I would get locked upside down in a locker for a day if I didn't buy it, I still wouldn't buy it.  This movie isn't even good enough to rent, even for free.  Spend your money on something else, don't go near this movie.  Please, please don't tell me they'll make a sequel, that will make this movie look even worse, cause I doubt they could make a sequel that was better than this horrible movie.  Please listen to my review, only rent this if your life was in the fate of this movie.  Anyway, that's all I got to say, DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS MOVIE.

963293,3,6305086737,"A young boy, Milo, kills a girl and stabs her friends. Sixteen years later, one of the girls, Claire, returns to the town to attend her friend's wedding. But when she arrives she learns the friend died in a car accident the day before. Claire takes over the friend's teaching job and soon she starts to see a boy who looks just like Milo.
This is the standard slasher movie plot but the movie is somewhat different. First of all, it has less main characters than most slashers, which makes you care more for them, and especially the heroine, Claire. On the other hand, less characters mean less opportunities to kill them. The result is a horror movie that is more of a mystery than a gory slasher.
The movie is director Pascal Franchot's first, and so far only moviem and some scenes could have been better made, but overall this is a good debut.
In my opinion, this is better than the standard slasher because the plot is more interesting and the characters are better than in many slashers and easier to care for. The last fifteen or twenty minutes aren't quite as good as the rest of the movie, but still not bad. If you're looking for a mystery-horror movie, give this a try! If you want a slahser with as many killings as possible, there are other movies that would be better.",1048377600,7,1282,4.459574468085107
963294,4,6305086737,"Not bad, but not great, it is just good. I like it. It was scary and creepy, with great music and exceptional acting, and haveing the kid as the killer is a twist. Rent before buying, and watch this one alone in the dark.",1042934400,2,221,4.045454545454546
