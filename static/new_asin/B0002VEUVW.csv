8032971,1,B0002VEUVW,"I'm not stranger to the bizarre realm of Japanese films.  Visitor Q is a movie I cherish.  This ""movie"" is awful.  These reviews praising it are staged because I didn't see the same movie they watched.  The ""movie"" I watched was terrible.  The characters aren't established and a story isn't told in this movie.  There's no political rebellion.  There is no redeeming frame in this movie.  You watch it and wait an hour and a half for 5 minutes of gore.  It's a joke.  This movie is no different than Birdemic.

Stay as far away from this ""movie"" as you can.  You won't experience anything new.  You'll kind of just want to die while it plays, but you won't be that lucky.",1364083200,,672,4.409836065573771
8032972,1,B0002VEUVW,"I experienced a viewing of this at a friends house and let me just say, disappointing is too kind of a word. He had bought the film after reading the glowing reviews on this site; which we are now entirely sure are planted by the company releasing this. This is the most disjointed, incoherent, sloppy, poorly executed piece of schlock I've seen in a long time. Contrary to the description of the movie, there is no plot. There is no rebellious school youth who perform social experiments. There is no message, and there definitely is no ""challenging society"". The first hour and a half are a bunch of supposed juveniles who sit around, smoke, drink, and have sex with the most butch oriental woman I've ever seen. Then finally, during the last half hour, they finally start showing the gore. At that point though, it really doesn't matter. You're so mentally drained and uncaring about any of the characters that you'd wish the shotgun blast was aimed at your own head. It doesn't fall into the category of so bad it's good, it just falls into regret and wasted time.",1364083200,3,1068,4.626315789473685
8032973,5,B0002VEUVW,"Whoa.  Director Kazuyoshi Kumakiri has officially graduated to the bloody big leagues.  Kichiku dai Enkai (Banquet of the Beasts) was his student project, and has now become a violent cult classic.  Although this graphic, low budget project has unfortunately remained obscure, it did recieve astounding critical acclaim in several film festivals.

Kichiku has a thin political backdrop, derived from a documentary the director watched as a kid.  The timeframe is in the late 60's/early 70's, when some left wing students with violent political ideas made plans to overthrow the government.  This film concentrates on the turmoil within the group.  Their tyrannical ways explode as paranoia mounts and frenzy blinds their ambition.  Brutal repurcussions as friends turn against friends.  Absolute chaos.

The beginning of this film is slow paced, as it tracks the group's slow regression into a state of violent hysteria.  Miyame is the psychotic female leader that uses sex to manipulate and mold the group to do her bidding.  In the second half, the mayhem explodes like you've never seen.  The group's plans unravel into some severe distrust, betrayal, anarchy, torture, and cold-blooded murder.  The violence pounds your senses like a jackhammer, some really gruesome special effects that will make even the jaded gorehound wince.  There is some over-the top blood spewage and decapitations that will give you quite a jolt.

I will admit, Kichiku dai Enkai is far from perfect.  It's main weakness is the first half, where some plot elements could have been better thought out.  Some of the characters motivations aren't explained very well.  But the extreme violence in the second half makes you forget all that.  Simply put, this is one of the most wickedly brutal and disturbing pieces ever committed to celluloid.  Low budget cinema at it's absolute finest.",1265328000,,1864,5.250847457627119
8032974,4,B0002VEUVW,"starts off innocent enough...i guess. pretty straight forward story.

 brutal. the violence feels very real. I was surprised how insane this movie gets. don't watch with anyone under 18. over the top....there is only one  little creepy scene with the mask. overall not what i'd call scary. nor does it try to be.

nothing can prepare you for the finale.",1227225600,,353,4.833333333333333
8032975,5,B0002VEUVW,"Kichiku Dai Enkai is a splatter film from the late 90's that had a short run in film festivals before disappearing into obscurity. Not too many people know about this one, but it definitely deserves to be in the running for most disturbing film ever made. It's about the breakdown of a political activist group in the 70's and a general assessment of the state of the Japanese government at the time. After the leader of the group is imprisoned and commits suicide, the film captures the group in an almost documentary way as it follows their slow progression into paranoia and insanity before completely destroying each other. This film is not for everybody, it takes a little while for healthy amounts of red stuff to appear on screen, and it is not for the attention deficit, but patient viewers will be rewarded. If you feel like having your senses violated without having your intelligence violated check this one out, you will not be disappointed.",1218585600,2,953,4.781818181818182
8032976,5,B0002VEUVW,"Basically it shows a group of students as a reflection of society leading a hive mentality. Follow the leader. Do what leader says because leader is in charge and knows everything...even when leader is a psycho. It's NOT pure gore for gore's sake, but it honestly has a message how the hive mentality can lead to total annihilation. For a group...or an entire nation. Actually the main leader is in jail, and he leaves his girlfriend in charge. The main leader commits suicide. From that point she really goes wacko and leads the group to pure self destruction. And they all listen and obey her cause she's in charge...

The plot is well understood--not defragmented like a lot of asian horror--but very clear and precise. The story develops very nicely...and there is plenty of pure GORE to satisfy the true-blue horror fan. The special gore effects are really great. All in one bundle. I LOVED IT!!!

This is to be watched...and watched again!",1128470400,11,945,4.791411042944786
8032977,5,B0002VEUVW,"I caught this on TV at 9:00 PM last night-I thought it was interesting-yet, I found it stomach turnign! I totally had trouble trying to eat (because of the excessive gore)and about halfway through: I nearly threw up! I thought the storyline was neat though.-but I LOVED IT!

STORY: A leftist group leader in 70's Japan has been jailed- but then the girlfreind takes over as leader. Then one day, the group and the leader discover that He has committed suicde, so the group erupst into violent acts that leave Japan covered ith blood. Theres a storyline with out spoilers.

Thoughts: A great movie! I totally reccomend it to not oly gorehounds, but also to people who love asian movies.",1122163200,9,685,4.7
8032978,5,B0002VEUVW,"Kichiku Dai Enkai (""Banquet of the Beasts) is a vicious, brutal, nasty, psyche-scarring flick that sneaks up on you from the woods over to your left, lets you enjoy your little mid-afternoon snack, waits until you curl up for a nap, and then pounces, tearing out your viscera and shoving them down your throat.

It's that kind of movie. If ""Kichiku"" were a dog, it would be a large, faithful family hound, maybe a Black Lab or a St. Bernard, known for its even-tempered disposition. It would be good with kids. It would be friendly and huge and totally reliable. It would even be a little timid.

And then, all Stevie King's 'Cujo'-style, it would get rabies, go apesh*t, and decide to turn your neck into 100% ground beef by way of its super-masticating choppers.

It is 1969, Japan: a staid society is in turmoil as radicalized students stage protests, shut down the universities, and riot, rebel, grow their hair, and---those steeped in the darker shadows of the Counterculture, anyway---foment bloody rebellion.

Some more so than others, including the shadowy Aizawa's revolutionary gang, because if a movement for Progressive Social Change is about anything at all, it's about Justice, Freedom, Equality, and the right to go Jim Jones on your camp followers, fold, spindle, mangle and mutilate them, and sample their brains and guts. Right?

Right! Pol Pot and Mao Tse-Tung didn't go all soft and weepy over cracking a few souls for the good of the People, did they?

Neither does Miyame, girlfriend of jailed gang leader Aizawa, who has now taken total power over the gang. Aizawa dispatches henchman Fujiwara to check in on his little group, and to bear tidings of the Fearless Leader's imminent release from prison. And, you know, just to make sure the pot hasn't boiled over.

Which is a good thing, as it turns out, because the pot is bubbling furiously. Miyame has a few other plans percolating in her moral pressure cooker besides Truth, Justice, Motherhood & Apple Pie, including seducing as many of Aizawa's gang as she can get her hands on, assuming iron-fisted control over the group, dancing around in a creepy demon-mask, and giggling hysterically between bouts of depraved violence.

Oh yeah, and getting her hands on a stash of guns.

Before you can say ""think global, act local"", Miyame has seized total control, isolated her little band in the mountainous woodlands, and is engaging in her own little experiment on the finer points of human anatomy combined with scraping the last vestiges of human decency or scruple from her increasingly bloodthirsty pack. And then the Fun really begins.

""Kichiku Dai Enkai"" is divided into three parts, three 'Dai Enkai' parties: you could think of the whole movie as Appetizer, Lunch, and Dinner. Each 'party' begins with a Dance (Miyame with her demon-mask): following each dance, there's a sort of wilding, a descent into savagery.

There's no room for dessert, in this case, and you'll probably be full afterwards. That or Dead.

Director Kazuyoshi Kumakiri has created, concocted, distilled and injected a Dark Night of the Soul here, a savage howl of anger and Evil and savagery and cruelty.

Kumakiri is working on the low-end of low budget filmmaking here, and he does so masterfully, marshalling his scanty resources in such a way as to occlude the paucity of funds, or name-actors, or high-end effects. Lose yourself in this flick---in the spare, atonal shrieks and drum rattles of its soundtrack that punctuate the traipse into madness, in the grainy film quality that permeates, suffuses, and melds into a world of seamy, stinking dorm-rooms and seamier bungalows.

And the acting: for a low-budget flick, the acting is superb. It works. The students are zoned-out, goofy, giggling, smirking: kids who have too little supervision, too much time, too much access to gonzo drugs and not enough access to common sense.

Particularly good is Miyame (played by Mikami Sumiko), who sinks her choppers into her role as crazed tigress and purring, calculating dictator. It would be a tough gig in more accomplished hands: Sumiko is not an attractive creature---she's puffy and dumpy at best, with a lumpy, clayish head---but she has a raw, feral, bestial charisma, and charisma comes across in any tongue.

A warning: ""Kikichu"" takes its own sweet time bringing things to boil; it is almost serene, monastic, meditative. It took me three tries to get into its well-paced, reflective mood, and I'm glad I took the time to settle into the madness.

Gorehounds, in particular, will be well paid for their patience: as a tableau of pure, unfettered human cruelty, I don't think any film has approached ""Kichiku"" in sheer, bloody brutality. It has just about everything: depravity, torture, decapitation, dismemberment, exploding heads, castration, even cannibalism. It all positively stinks with the realism of yesterday's mass grave.

And as in any breviary of bruality, there is beauty among the madness: Kumakiri is an amazingly competent director, spinning out some truly haunting sequences, among them a trot down a bleak dorm-hall that conjures up a death camp hallway, or a doomed man, tortured eyes staring skyward, glimpsing the serene beauty of a sunset through the trees.

Kumakiri has captured, in this raw, bleak, damned world, precisely what Wes Craven might have accomplished---or might have been trying to accomplish---in his ""Last House on the Left"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"". ""Kichiku"" is parts a glimpse into the inner workings of a gulag, a death camp, and the shadow-haunted forests of the ""Blair Witch Project"".

""Kichiku"" is a sick, feral thing of beauty, and it is very hungry, and very human. Proceed with caution---but do proceed.
