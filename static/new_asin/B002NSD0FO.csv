GOOD THINGS..
great show, great playing, singing and cool filming

BAD THINGS
crappy DVD authoring, cheap packaging...slim dvd case, color copies for art..and a DVD R!!!!

so...proceed with caution..
hopefully a legit company other than Gigatone will get a hold of this and issue it proper!",1315267200,2,406,5.2153846153846155
