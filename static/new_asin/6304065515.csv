777183,3,6304065515,"I was quite surprised at how much I liked this.  It's a story of the reincarnation of a group of human/aliens who were stranded on the moon and are coming back as as teenagers in Japan.  Quite an interesting concept and story.  My biggest problem, however, and I hate to admit it, is keeping track of who's who.  A lot of the Japanese names sounded similar and some of the characters look similar (and there are a lot of them), so it can get confusing about who is who.  Not that in the long run it makes a big difference.  I have to say that the ending is quite anti-climactic too, but overall the whole experience of this anime was pretty entertaining.  Maybe on more viewings more will become clear.",976233600,2,702,4.3538461538461535
777184,4,6304065515,"Storyline:
 Three Junior High students realize they share recurrent ""moon dreams"".  They have connections to alter-egos in three of seven scientists on the moon.  After locating  the other four moon dreamers,  they decypher the dreams' true meaning.  This has a profound impact on their futures and reveals/explains latent talents in the dreamers.
good parts:
 *This is a philosophical work which takes you on an emotional journey.  First you envy the dreamers, but then realize the dreams come at a high cost.  Intense feelings of all kinds are created with a ""bratty little boy"" character.
* Uniquely a  ""pure shoujo"" love story with zero fan service or other gimmicks.
* Excellent value with 6 episodes on one disc.  Plus a really nice ending theme from Yoko Kano.
bad parts:
 *The last half of the manga (comic book) story was chopped in order to fit this in just 6 episodes.  It would have been one of the best series ever  if extended to12 episodes.  It ends giving you an empty feeling of incompleteness.
overall:
 Even half of this excellent story is still worth buying!  Not for little kids, as they wouldn't understand the concepts in such a complex plot.  A big step up from typical shoujo anime.",976060800,4,1207,4.804878048780488
777185,5,6304065515,"Please Save My Earth (PSME).
It's the story of six japanese teens and one boy who seem to share a common past; a common past-LIFE to be exact. In their past lives they were the crew of a science station based on the earths moon. They where put there to monitor the earths development and to do research. But one day a new, unknown, virus strikes the inhabitants of the moon, which results in their ultimate demise. Only to be reincarnated on earth in a different life and in our era.
As humans they start remembering their past lives and actualy find out who the others are in their earth life. As the plot slowly unfolds the trueth, as to what happened on the moon, becomes clear to them. It turns out that there was an antidote to the virus... but only for one person, but because of jelousy she didn't get it.  This is the story of the man who had the misfortune of being cured... all alone for the rest of his life. As it turns out hate, love, jelousy and a lust for revenge can also reincarnate. But in a way you never would have imagined!
When first I saw PSME I was beguiled by it's, sometimes, dreamlike visuals, enchanting music and orriginal plot. Even after having seen it many times over I still can't get enough of it This DVD is a definate 'best buy' in my oppinion, all six eps. on one disc and, just like the budgy, it's *cheap* too. You can't expect anything fancy in the form of state of the art computer graphics or Dolby Digital audio encoding. But at this price and so much to enjoy on one disc, you can not go wrong with PSME.",971395200,,1548,4.247457627118644
777186,5,6304065515,"I've seen this OAV over twenty times ever since it was released on VHS,  and I continue to watch it. If you like a good story, then this is it. I  think it has one of the best stories you'll see in any film, and the plot  is really good. It's not in the fast-paced action-type genre that many  people like, but rather, it's slow building. That's not a bad thing,  however. I have enjoyed it very much. If you have free time when no one  could bother you, you can fully enjoy this title. If you do like this film,  I recommend you to also watch ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" which  also has a good story. I won't talk about these anime titles, since I don't  want to give away any spoilers -- just go ahead and buy these two titles.  You'll love it!",968716800,2,744,4.068965517241379
777187,5,6304065515,"This 6 part OAV has beautiful animation, great music (composed by Hajime Mizoguchi and an ending song by Yoko Kanno), and a complicated and gripping  plot. It is a love story between Alice and her younger neighbor Rin, based  on a manga of the same title. It's also a story with revenge, destiny,  romance, guilt, redemption and plenty of secrets and plot twists.
6 high  school students thought they were normal - until they start having moon  dreams. Slowly, they begin to realize these dreams tell of their past lives  - a time when a group of 7 alien scientists lived on the moon to watch over  and care for earth. As they meet together to discuss the dreams, more about  their past is revealed - and more questions arise. Why were they brought  back to life on earth? Where is the 7th scientist of their group?
The  ending is a little rushed - there are over 20 volumes of manga being  covered in the 6-part series, so it expected that some questions will be  left unanswered. The movie, not yet released in America, retells the series  in a 90 minute movie with some added scenes that help that problem a bit,  however.
The DVD contains both English and Japanese tracks, a FAQ, a  no-credit version of the ending, and biographies on all the 7 main  characters and their other lives. While I'm generally a strict sub-fan, I  have to admit that the dubs weren't too bad. They were done by The Ocean  Group from Canada, who are known for good dubs - Gundam Wing, Escaflowne,  Ranma 1/2. The bios and FAQ may contain some spoilers for those who haven't  watched the series yet, but I felt they helped me remember all the  characters and keep their reincarnations straight. You get a very brief run  down in one of the earlier episodes in the series, but with all the plot  twists, it can start to get confusing by the end.
The only thing I don't  like about this DVD is the cover art. It isn't bad - but it could have been  a lot better:o) It just doesn't strike me as something a casual view might  pick up - whereas the VHS boxes were much more intriguing to the browsing  eye. Also, its a picture of the moon lives and I personally feel the story  is much more about their present incarnations.
Other than that little  tidbit, the DVD is great:) It contains all 6 episodes on one DVD and the  previously unreleased Japanese version! It's a great story and definitely a  positive addition to anyone's collection!",967852800,,2416,4.459954233409611
777188,4,6304065515,"This is a great OVA series.  Do yourself a favor and get this one, believe me, you will love it.  The story goes like this:  A group of seven kids discover that they are the reincarnations of seven alien beings who had  watched the earth for many years.  But two of the seven harbor a secret  that makes them deadly rivals.  It is a story filled with interesting  plot twists and a nearly incomprehesible finale.  Okay...it's not that bad,  but when you see it, you'll know what I mean.  The DVD has an unneeded FAQ  section that explains many points that are revealed in the serise.  I guess  it's there for those who didn't pay attention.  I suggest you use the  subtitled version of the serise, for the dubbing isn't excellent.  But  those who perfer dubs, it's not that bad.  As I said before, this anime is  definately worth looking at.",964742400,,841,4.443708609271523
777189,5,6304065515,"A few years back I was looking for something in anime that wasn't the same drivel I had come to expect. I came across a video with a young boy on the front in front of Tokyo Tower. Well, I found one of the best OAV series' I  have ever seen. I have worn the tapes into bad quality by the time the DVD  has finally become available. The story is wonderful and if there is any  problem in understanding the complexity of the plot then you can get all  the general info ya need on the net. I have been a solid fan of this anime  for many years and the dvd only made it more enjoyable.",963273600,,581,3.889830508474576
777190,5,6304065515,"One of the most beautiful anime i've ever seen. The art is wonderful, the music is beautiful and suits the anime well, and the story is good. Unfortunately it's only six episodes long. It would've been better if they  added a few more episodes instead of rushing the series.
PSME is about  seven main characters that share a common dream about another life on the  moon. They are drawn together eventually in their present life to atone for  what they've done in their past life. A story about love, faith, and  destiny. One that won't dissapoint.",962064000,2,547,4.65625
777191,5,6304065515,"The DVD covers the three OAV videos (OAV - 'original anime video' in Japan) that were a condensed version of a 14 book (manga) story. The videos were never meant to tell the story - they were only meant to cover some of  the key points of the books for the thousands who fell in love with the  ""Please Save My earth"" story in Japan.
For those who haven't  read the series, it may be a bit confusing - especially since story arcs in  the videos are never explained or finished (3/4 of the whole story is not  covered in the videos).  However, the animation is very good and the story  is exquisite - not to mention the haunting music at the end.
This is my  favorite of all my anime - a beautiful and wonderfully original love story.
This is a DVD you will want to watch many times as you discover more  about the story each time. Definitely not one you get bored of watching. I  highly recommend it - just don't get frustrated by the lack of concrete  ending.  This journey is much more fun than the arrival.",961977600,15,1008,4.219895287958115

The art is simple but very beautiful, the music  is awesome and fits the story wonderfully.

The story is very good but it have some unanswer questions.  I don't know how many time I saw it and still love it.  The voice dub in english of the characters are great, they fit them perfectly.

777315,5,6304065515,"I really loved this OAV. Since everyone has already pretty much summed up the story with the seven scientists living on the moon and then being reincarnated on Earth, I'll move on to the DVD itself. Well, the nicest thing of all is that this DVD contains all six episodes of the OAV which were originally on three seperate VHS tapes. The quality of the animation is amazing. The colors are crisp and bright and the character designs are absolutely gorgeous. Extra's include a section full of viz products including trailers for quite a few other anime (Yay commercials, I can't help it I'm wierd and I like watching them.), also a creditless ending (not that big of a whoop), most frequently asked questions, and a really really helpful character profile and info section. This is great because all seven scientists look TOTALLY different reincarnated, some even switching genders. It gets really confusing who is who and I found myself referring to it a few times throughout the show.
The dub is pretty good as well, not the best but it didn't make me cringe like some shows.
  The music is also another plus. It is soooooo pretty and eerie. It sounds really cool at some parts and fits well in the scenes. The story is very good as well. It's very touching and at the same time exciting. No matter how many times I watch it I never get sick of it. I totally reccomend this show to any anime fan. It has enough action, romance, drama, and science fiction to appeal to everyone.",1024704000,2,1478,4.573584905660377
777316,3,6304065515,honestly ...its really sad when u watch it and like it so much and then suddenly it just ends with u haveing a question mark up ur head..i liked the weird story of 2 lifes..the onse in the past and the future..its so imaginary..but there is no ending..u have to read the book to know the ending..thats sad..,1022457600,2,307,4.310344827586207
777317,2,6304065515,"It's not that I dislike all shojo. It's just that so much of it is this magical girl stuff that is really unappealing. So when I started watching this I was pleasantly surprised. By the end of the second episode, I was totally hooked. The story, of six people who dream of their past lives together living as scientists on the moon is very intriguing, as well as beautiful, and the characters that are first introduced are very well done. The whole thing was beautiful and compelling.
Of course, that made it all the worse when every single story line was seemingly abandoned mid way through. Instead the show deteriorates all of a sudden into some ridiculous dragonball z like fighting scenes, and is concluded with some lengthy out of context flashback sequences that use confusing situations and extensive imagery to hide the fact that there is no ending. At this point I should mention that I know this is based on a much longer manga which tells a much more thorough story. I searched for the manga but was never able to find it, if indeed it was ever even released in the U.S. Given this lack of availability, I sort of wish that the anime told more of the story. After all, if you saw the first half of a movie and liked it but the second half was incomplete, confusing, jumbled images, you wouldn't rate it very highly. The same principle is at play here. Hence, two stars.",1018569600,,1381,4.50597609561753

This is a DEEP anime. Like ""Lum Urusei Yastura. Beautiful Dreamer"" & ""Grave of the Fireflies"" you slowly sink deeper & deeper into the story, & you have to pay atention because it's complex & all ties togeather. If you blink you'll miss something.

Love, regret, betrayal, hope, and redemption all come to the seven characters who discover that they are reincarnations of scientists who once watched over Earth from a base on the moon. Meet Alice, a school living in Japan and trying her best to stay sane while living next door to the bratty Rin. She has always felt different, having the abilities to understand and speak to plants and animals, and never quite had the answer to it all. That is until she stumbles onto her fellow school-mates, Issie and Jinpachi. They have had identical dreams ever since middle school, and always with the same people in the same place: a scientific base on the moon. Alice is intrigued, but thinks nothing of it...until she herself has the same dream. Only this time it is of a beautiful woman named Mokuren and a handsome man called Shion, who appear to be lovers and live on the same moon base Issei and Jinpachi had mentioned. When Alice tells her new friends about the dream, they are convinced that she is the reincarnation of Mokuren, the woman who's eyes she saw through in the dream. But it's the last dream she has of the base, and she begins to doubt if she truely is Mokuren. What starts out as a mere endeavor to find out about their past turns into a fight for all of them to survive when Alice's neighbor, Rin, turns out to be the vengeful Shion, Mokuren's lover.

The anime is what prompted me to find and read the manga. I would never have known about it otherwise and now that I've found it it's become my favorite story of all time. For me at least this anime was a great draw to the manga series, because it told some of the story, but left just enough room for me to want to know more.",1259452800,,663,4.1875
7861094,5,6304065515,"Please Save My Earth has been my favorite manga since I first read it a few years ago, but it took me a while to get a hold of the anime, which is unfortunately out of print.  With its fascinating story, memorable characters and beautiful music and animation, it was definitely worth the search.

Although it doesn't cover all of the story from the 21-volume manga (how could it?), this six episode OVA (original video animation) does a fantastic job of adapting the start of the manga.  This is the story of seven young people in Japan who learn through their dreams that they are the reincarnations of aliens who watched over the Earth from the moon.  It might sound a little trippy, but this premise leads to some excellent characterization.  What would it be like to have someone else's memories in your head?  Would it change your own personality?  Would you look at the people around you differently?  Would you start behaving differently?  Would you still be ""you""?  PSME's characters have to deal with all of these questions in one way or another.  The themes of identity, childhood, and nostalgia for the past come up quite a lot.

Aesthetically, PSME is stunning.  The art/animation is smooth and detailed, with rich colors, and it's aged extremely well in my opinion -- OVAs usually have visuals of a higher quality than TV series, and PSME is no exception to that.  (It made me want to check out other OVAs from around the same time in the hopes they might look as good.)  The haunting music also deserves a mention -- it's gorgeous and it fits the series perfectly.

And yes, the story you see here isn't ""finished,"" but the anime writers did attempt some closure.  If you haven't read the manga (you should!), you'll more than likely have questions at the end, but at least the ending feels like an good place to stop, which is more than I can say for some adaptations of long manga.

Out of 6 episodes contained on this DVD, the 5 first ones are exceptionnaly good, they are true jewels.  The 6th episode, however, condenses all the remaining events of the story without even getting to the end of the books.  In my opinion, this is absolutely unacceptable, because the original japanese version of this animated series covers MUCH MORE of the book series, with all the mad plot twists that makes Please Save my Earth the masterpiece that it is.  I seriously think that big parts of the animated episodes were cut out of the American DVD , censored, because they would have been too hard on the watcher and would have made this DVD for a -- perhaps -- more mature audience.
In short, discovering Please Save my Earth through this DVD might be a nice experience, but it defenitly isn't what the real story is about.  It doesn't end like this.
