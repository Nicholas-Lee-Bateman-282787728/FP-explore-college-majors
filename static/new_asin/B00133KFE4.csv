8248932,3,B00133KFE4,There were no redeeming values in this movie about a woman who desired two men. A woman torn between an ex-husband and a present one who happened to be a doctor &a decent family man. C'mon why complicate your life & still lust foryour ex?Have some sense of decency.,1469664000,,265,4.428571428571429
8248933,2,B00133KFE4,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This looks like it might be
a really good film. The problem I have with it is that the VOD rental is in Spanish
without subtitles or dubbing into English. I think Amazon could be more clear explaining
this before you rent the film. I think Victoria Abril is a wonderful actress and I was
looking forward to watching her in this movie. I will look for the film on DVD if I
can find it.",1287878400,,439,4.057471264367816
8248934,4,B00133KFE4,"This was an interesting look at a bizarre love triangle in Spain.  A wife's poor, dying ex-husband is taken in by her and her new family.  The current husband and the two were friends since being children.  This work will make you question if a person can only have one true love.  For those who are sensitive about bumping into exes, this will have an impact as well.  The work meditates on meeting others in a different life and not being able to let go of the past two.
This work is very sexy.  It has female and male nudity.  Some people may be used to the ""I have a headache!"" line, but the female lead here has no probably keeping men satisfied.  The late Eve Sedgwick Kosofsky wrote that in literary love triangles, the men fighting over the damsel in distress often love each other too.  Here, one man kisses the other.  It's done in the platonic, European  way, but it can still be read as homoerotic.  Personally, I think the film implies that the wife could be carrying any man's child, Maury Povich-style!
I'm not a little-kid person, but the two child actors here are just adorable.  Their lines also add depth to the script, not just cuteness.  This film was made more than 15 years ago, and I hope the children haven't suffered as many American child stars have.
I don't think this was an Almodovar film, but it has elements like his oeuvre.  This work joins many others which show that the Spanish film industry really produces an amazing body of work.  I enjoyed this film a lot. This was serendipity!",1257552000,3,1518,4.465454545454546
