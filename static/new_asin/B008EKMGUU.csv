8527157,5,B008EKMGUU,"Say what you will of this production of Rinaldo but regardless of what you think of the setting, the music is wonderful.

I have both a DVD and CD of David Daniels singing the lead roll but Sonia Prina is actually much better in this production.  On top of that, the sets and costumes look really good on the Blu-Ray and the picture and sound are first rate.

This is musically my favorite version of Rinaldo.",1484784000,,409,4.355263157894737

8527159,5,B008EKMGUU,"Sprightly, splendid, magical, and charming! Musically and vocally as lovely as the Bartoli/Daniels/et al performance on CDs, but with the addition of a terrific full theatrical performance (Glyndbourne). Sonia Prina is a perfect Rinaldo (vocally, acting), Luca Pisaroni a smashing Argante (again, vocally and in acting), and Brenda Rae a brilliantly wicked Armida who is also touchingly vulnerable (after all, she does fall in love with Rinaldo, just as Argante falls in love with Rinaldo's lady love, the delightful  and steadfast Almirena). And the rest of the cast is fully up to these standards. Ottavio Dantone and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment are not only scintillating and swift, they also know when it is time to also be thoroughly grand. The conceit (the overall metaphor)of this production, of Rinaldo as a bullied schoolboy studying the Crusades, works great. (The male brutish teacher and the frightful, cruel female teacher return as Argante and Armida, and so on.) I own both the Bartoli/Daniels CDs and this DVD. If you possibly can, please get both (you wouldn't, for example, want to miss Almirena and Rinaldo--Bartoli and Daniels-- singing of their love and the little birds). On the other hand, if I had to choose just one, I'd go for this DVD. And by the way, for me a first-ever experience: the extras are not gaseous and self-important (as they usually are) but really informative and a great pleasure.",1417132800,3,1437,5.063291139240507
8527160,5,B008EKMGUU,"This production of Rinaldo makes me wonder if Robert Carsen was bullied as a child and is reliving his revenge fantasies. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. I found it all very entertaining and for those of us who actually went to school in England it also provides some recognizable images (which may inspire nostalgia or horror depending on one's personal experience). For me, transposing the story to an English boarding school was an ingenious idea. For a modern audience (and probably for the original audiences too) the stories of Baroque opera are as irrelevant as they are historically inaccurate. They exist only as a framework to hang the stories of human interactions (usually love complications of one sort or another) in order to explore human emotions (and, of course, as a showcase for vocal display). Most of the plots are ridiculous if taken literally so I don't see any harm in reinterpreting them so long as the underlying and intended emotions still arise convincingly from the altered scenario. This new production succeeds in doing that. What schoolboy hasn't indulged in fantasies, a la 'Billy Liar,' about being a great warrior and rescuing a fair maiden in distress? Particularly if he is subjected to bullying and in need of a little escapism and some means, if only imaginary, of bettering his persecutors? By wrapping the old crusader story in this modern super-scenario, Carsen has made it more believable and added an extra dimension of pathos. Of course, none of this is strictly necessary. Telling the story straight and in a traditional setting would be just fine and I would have greatly enjoyed it, I'm sure. But Carsen has given us a new way to relate to this story and that is not a trivial thing. Its moments of great humor are not out of place and do not short change the deeper emotions. The end of the opera, when Rinaldo is stripped of his armor and finds himself back in his old school and his old predicament (presumably unchanged by his fantasy) adds ironic poignancy to the traditional, victorious ending.

The singing and acting are all first rate. Sonia Prina is believable as a schoolboy and her rich contralto is very satisfying in the role. Brenda Rae as a ""dominatrix"" Armida is breathtaking and sounds  as authoritative as she looks. She is also able to effectively demonstrate vulnerability when needed. Luca Pisaroni is brilliant as Argante. He's one of the finest operatic baritones today and has a great instinct for his roles and incredible stage presence. His acting steals the show in whatever scene he is in. Anett Fritsch has a wonderful, luminous voice though she is a little nondescript in the role of Almirena. She is, however, sufficiently waifish and vulnerable to credibly portray an adolescent schoolgirl. Tim Mead has a particularly marvelous countertenor voice and his Eustazio is very enjoyable to hear. Handel's music for this opera is a thing of wonder. One hit after another from beginning to end. There's not a single aria that doesn't grab one's attention, especially when played by one of the finest Baroque orchestras in the world along with singers of the caliber we have here. All round this is a great and highly entertaining production of Handel's first London opera which explores all the meaning and emotion inherent in the opera within a context that gives it an added relevance. Don't let the naysayers turn you off to this one. It has a lot of things in its favor and the purists only hurt themselves by refusing to accept such innovations.",1381104000,7,3535,4.870431893687708
8527161,3,B008EKMGUU,"This Glyndebourne production of Handel's great ""Rinaldo"" is set on a Harry Potter type school for teenagers.  There are misbehaving children, amorous teachers, and dreams of battles, crusades and sorcery.  BUT, does it work? Alas, not for me.

""RegiaTheater"" is the term used over the past decade or so, for stage works (plays/operas) wherein the director's radical take largely overwhelms the underlying work being performed.  It has, here in America, a very negative connotation, smacking of German/Austrian uber-works and director hubris.  Most opera fans here will say that they hate it and just condemn these productions, often sight unseen.  (""I'll play the dvd but only to listen to the music."") But, the audience for these directorial efforts is more amenable in Europe.

But what is RegiaTheater really?  The idea, as here, of changing the time and place where the work is set is hardly new.  Orson Welles did it in the 1930's with Shakespeare, and the idea is so common as to be hardly radical.  I can scarcely think of a Shakespeare play that I have seen in the past fifteen years (live or dvd) where this wasn't the case.

The same is true with many opera productions, both now and over the past years.  Think of Peter Sellars updating of the Mozart/DaPonte operas into modern New York&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Cosi-fan-Tutte-Susan-Larson-James-Maddalena-Sanford-Sylvan-Peter-Sellars-Craig-Smith-Wiener-Symphoniker-Peter-Sellars/dp/B00092ZANQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte / Susan Larson, James Maddalena, Sanford Sylvan, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker, Peter Sellars</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni/dp/B00092ZAN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Don Giovanni</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-Sanford-Sylvan-Susan-Larson-Jeanne-Ommerle-Sue-Ellen-Kuzma-Frank-Kelley-Peter-Sellars-Craig-Smith-Wiener-Symphoniker/dp/B00092ZANG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro / Sanford Sylvan, Susan Larson, Jeanne Ommerle, Sue Ellen Kuzma, Frank Kelley, Peter Sellars, Craig Smith, Wiener Symphoniker</a>.

This updating/transformation is as common in opera now as it is in Shakespeare play performances.  But is it the evil ""RegiaTheater?""

I address this here because I have just watched two 2011 performances released on dvd where this was a key part of the production.  This performance of ""Rinaldo"" and Pesaro's production of ""Mose in Egitto, set in modern war torn Middle East&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mos-in-Egitto-Rossini-Opera-Festival-2011-Blu-ray/dp/B009F7YTC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mos in Egitto (Rossini Opera Festival 2011) [Blu-ray</a>].  (I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Mose"", but found this ""Rinaldo"" much less effective.)

And even the Peter Sellars productions of the Mozart operas were artistically uneven, in my opinion.  (The Cosi set in Despina's Caf worked quite well, and Figaro set in the Trump Tower worked pretty good, but a Count living on the 50th floor?  I don't think so.  And the ""Don Giovanni"" set in Harlem's ghetto did not work well at all.)

But let's start by examining this Rinaldo.  It opens during the overture, with Rinaldo (played as a trouser role by Sonia Prima) entering the classroom, dreaming about adventures.  He is then beset by his classmates, and eventually the teacher where he is caned for some offenses.  Thereafter, it transforms into the Crusader world of rinaldo, and plays out the story.

In most of the first act, the actors where their school gear (preppy jacket and ties, pullover dresses for the girls) with armor or helmets placed over them/.  In the second act, the school clothes largely disappear un til the end.  For me, this staging really didn't work, and just didn't make sense.  One detail, which illustrates it for me.  Ultimately, it is a love story between Rinaldo and Almirena, where they profess their profound love for each other several times.  But, both are dressed in prep school outfits, clearly intended to be about 14 years old or so, so this intense romance (even lust) is highly in appropriate.  So, again for me, it just didn't work.

The singers were quite excellent.  I particularly enjoyed Luca Pisaroni as Arganto.  He followed it up later in the year with ""The Enchanted Island""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enchanted-Island-The-Metropolitan-Opera-HD-Live-2011/dp/B008ROGZUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enchanted Island (The Metropolitan Opera HD Live 2011)</a>where he was also excellent.

So, is it ""Regiatheater"" and what does that mean?  I take it this way.  Any radical changing of the setting/time of a work is a form of regiatheater, so just labeling as such  is not helpful.  All that really matters is does the change make for an effective production, one which MAY get you to re-think other aspects of the work in question.  (Also to be considered- is it internally consistent, which can be a problem.  If it is not consistent, then it is effect just for effect's sake.)  And sometimes, whether it is regiatheater or not may just be a matter of degree (how much is the underlying work smothered by the staging?).

Here, although I didn't think the staging overwhelmed the story, I just thought it didn't make sense.",1361318400,9,5712,6.266666666666667
8527162,2,B008EKMGUU,"This was a rather novel setting for the opera in an English school. While the singing was very good, as well as the acting, the interpretation is weird. I prefer a more traditional production. It seems arrogant on the part of opera producers to reject tradition in favor of their own fads. If you look at the box cover, it appears traditional. But, you will not get tradition. You get a sorceress who is some type of sex freak with punk-mod girls as her assistance. Traditional opera setting as required by the composer provides us with real insight into the past and the composer's mind. A really good traditional production can complement our understanding of some of the great CD recordings.",1357257600,8,694,4.743801652892562
8527163,5,B008EKMGUU,"It's always good to have a fresh outlook placed on the subjects of Handel's Baroque operas - or at least I think so anyway.  Whether it's traditional (although I've never seen a Handel opera done ""authentically"" period), whether it's in a modern setting, or according to a more abstract conception, it helps if there is a strong vision that is able to reconsider what the essential themes of the work are and how they can be best presented to a modern audience.  The purpose of any production, modern dress or otherwise, must surely be to reflect on what the work is actually about, not recreate a historical performance, and if it can break through the rigid formalism of opera seria and actually make it entertaining at the same time, well then so much the better.

Recognising that Handel's first London opera from 1711 is not the most consistent work, the majority of it cobbled together like a remix of Handel's earlier greatest hits, it certainly does no harm to try and make it look as fresh and meaningful as Handel somehow manages to make it all sound.  Robert Carsen makes his intentions clear from the outset, asking the question ""Were the Crusades political or inspired by an act of personal vengeance?""  This message is written in chalk across a blackboard and it's an English boys' boarding school that acts as the backdrop or framing device to delve into the personal sentiments expressed so beautifully if somewhat generically in what is after all a patched together piece.  In response to this history lesson question, a young boy, bullied and teased by his classmates, his life made a misery by his authoritarian teachers, imagines himself the great warrior Rinaldo and sees the mighty forces of Goffredo coming out from behind the blackboard to slay his tormentors.

Setting a Crusades war within the confines of a boarding school, the action taking place in classrooms, bike-sheds, dorms and locker rooms, with a gym turned into a torture chamber (there's a difference?) and an epic battle taking place on a football pitch, the production could however just as easily be seen as itself placing a distance between the actual events described and sung about in the libretto, but Carsen manages nonetheless to faithfully retain the entire sense of the original work within this setting.  In the mind of a schoolboy, this story is wrapped up in teasing by his classmates over his girlfriend, and the dark figures of authority that keep them apart are those of the school teachers.  Mix in some Furies with a St Trinian's thing going on and sadistic teachers in rubber bondage outfits and it certainly adds another dimension to the passions and characterisation of these mythological figures.  There are lots of clever little details in the props, uniforms and locations of the school that fit very well with the Crusade theme, but these, quite correctly, remain secondary to the love story whose purity is reflected perfectly in the innocence of first-love in the playground and by the bike-sheds.

Many of the directorial choices provoke laughs from the audience at Glyndebourne, which you might not consider appropriate for an opera seria, but it shows that there is genuine engagement with the work.  Whether it also inspires the performers I couldn't say, but musically and in terms of the singing, this is a magnificent production, so at least it clearly isn't a distraction.  All the main roles are sung terrifically well.  Tim Mead is one of the best Handel countertenors, but I've never heard him singing so well as Eustazio, his voice as angelically pure as a schoolboy soprano, so perhaps the production does indeed help in that respect.  The purity and idealism of young love and innocent idealism also works in favour of contralto Sonia Prina's Rinaldo and Anett Fritsch's Almirena - both combining expressiveness with a gorgeous clarity and tone; and if being a sadistic headmaster and a kinky dominatrix school teacher gives force to the commanding performances of Luca Pisaroni and Brenda Rae as Argante and Armida - both of them demonstrating masterful coloratura - then I've no problem with that either.  Varduhi Abrahamyan's Goffredo sounds strong enough at the start, but she isn't able to sustain this through to the final act.

The whole thing however is held together and driven along musically by the outstanding performance of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under Ottavio Dantone and anchored by his scintillating harpsichord playing, and it's given additional emphasis in the clarity of the audio tracks on this DVD/BD release.  I don't think I praise the actual quality of the sound reproduction on Blu-ray releases quite enough, but when you hear the tone of the Baroque period instruments in orchestral playing like this and exceptionally good singing, it just sounds incredible.  This is a very fine recording.  Image quality too is near flawless, the production covered well in the editing with no distractions.  The Opus Arte release also contains a few excellent short features on the production and the musical interpretation in the extra features interviews (it's good to hear the musicians views for a change), and there's a booklet with an essay on the work and a full synopsis.  The BD is all-region, 1080i Full-HD, with PCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes.  Subtitles are in English, French and German only.",1346544000,17,5381,4.981026785714286
