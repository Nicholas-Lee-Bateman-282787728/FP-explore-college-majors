6114849,3,B00GUO3C3W,"""I ain't selling drugs no more counselor. I'm giving them away by selling memberships...you get all the meds you want...welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club."" Ron Woodruff (McConaughey) is a stereotypical redneck in the 80's. He is racist and homophobic, and in between getting drunk works as an electrician at a construction site. When a work accident lands him in the hospital he is told that he is HIV positive and has 30 days to live. This changes his whole world, his old friends are replaced by new friends, he changes his out look on life and is now doing everything he can to help others like him. Even if that means skirting the law. After all the talk about the performances in this movie I was excited to see it. They were great but I think that skewed the way people felt about the movie. I'm not denying that McConaughey and Leto deserve awards, because they do but I wouldn't consider this an amazing movie. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie and should be seen and I think it does deserve all the accolades that the actors are getting but the movie Puncture just had a grittier feel to it and I liked that one more. I know the two really don't have that much more in common then one man trying to change the system while dealing with a drug problem but that one made me care more about the main character. While Ron does have some good qualities that come out in the end you have a hard time liking him. Overall, a good movie with great acting that should be seen. I give it a B.",1389052800,4,1504,4.299295774647887
6114850,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I heard this interview with Matthew McConaughey on NPR a while back about how his family lost a lawsuit because he won the most attractive award (or some such) his senior year of high school. [It's an amusing story about his early high school issues with acne.] You would never be able to tell that from the way he looks in Dallas Buyers Club.

Seriously, McConaughey looks awful, and that's saying a lot considering who he is. He looks like he's wasting away, which is appropriate to the character of Ron Woodroof, who is dying of AIDS.

In the 80s, when I grew up, we were going to die of one of two things:
1. ""Russia"" (in quotes because it wasn't really Russia; it was the USSR) was going to destroy the world in nuclear fire (or a computer mistake was. It was probably 50/50 which direction that would go).
2. We were all going to die of ""the AIDS.""

Dallas Buyers Club completely captures the horror of discovering having HIV in the 80s and the prejudice that went with it. [Like when I was in middle school and all of my friends told me (completely seriously) that I was going to die because I sat in the same chair as someone with AIDS that had visited our classroom.] McConaughey is absolutely brilliant. The wail he releases in his car once he has actually confronted what's going on is... I have no other word than chilling.

Seriously, I have never thought much of McConaughey other than that he's mostly a pretty boy that can memorize lines. He's never stood out to me as more than someone with a charming smile, but, in this, he is amazing. His willingness to destroy his body for the part rivals anything Christian Bale has ever done, and he brings a stellar performance along with it. If he doesn't get best actor for this role, it will be a huge injustice.

Jared Leto's performance is also incredible as the fictional conglomeration character Rayon. The relationship between Woodroof and Rayon is demonstrative of Woodroof's changing views as he formed relationships in the community suffering from the same fate as he.

AIDS and the fear of AIDS doesn't carry with it the same weight as it used to, and I don't think people growing up in the 90s and later have the same understanding of HIV as people who went through the 80s when it suddenly became an epidemic. Safe sex has become normative, at least, the idea of it has. Prior to 80s and HIV, the idea of using ""protection"" during sex was mostly to prevent unwanted pregnancies. At least, that's my perception of it.

At any rate, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerful movie, the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.",1388361600,11,2619,4.512658227848101
6114851,1,B00GUO3C3W,"After having start watching ""Getting On"" on HBO,the hospital scenes in this movie are hard to believe. (Although I am biased, since I play a part in the series).
I do like the set design and costumes and I have to say, I admire Jared Leto's choices. It seems to me, Leto really goes for it without fear. Congrats to the production team and talent for addressing this important issue. However, I think, certain scenes and interactions of the Actors were missing some guidance and directing. There is a lot of talent in this movie and with the right directing, this could have been a very interesting ride. Sometimes, it feels, people are trying to hard, or not hard enough. But overall, I generally enjoy movies set in this particular era.

6114854,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

It seems that Matthew McConaughey gets better and better as an actor with each film he's in.  In this depressing (sorry) film he plays the real life Ron Woodroof.  Set in 1985 Dallas, Woodroof is a skilled electrician (like his daddy), who plays harder than he works.  He's a womanizing, part time bull-riding racist.  He also likes a little ""smack"" to go with his women and his booze.

His negligence gets him a full blown case of HIV and ultimately AIDS.  Given a month to live (he makes it 7 years), Woodroof pulls out all the stops to get drugs to help fight the disease.  At the time, little was known about the disease but AZT was believed to have a positive effect and was approved for testing.  But certainly not in the large doses, Ron was taking.  His ill-gotten supply eventually runs out so he goes to Mexico to get some new treatment, none of which includes AZT or any other hard drug for that matter.

Given that AIDS mostly affected homosexual men at the time, Woodroof was ostracized by his friends and co-workers.  He eventually has to put his homophobic beliefs aside and works with another patient at the hospital to create a ""club"" where membership includes free medicine.  This sidesteps the law against bringing drugs of any kind into the country and reselling them without a proper license.

His friend Rayon (a memorable performance by Jared Leto) becomes his assistant and recruiter.  Woodroof ends up going to Japan, The Netherlands and China after his access to Mexico is curtailed.  All along the way, the DEA and other government entities stifle his ability to get treatment approved in the U. S.

The film isn't pleasant to watch, but does raise the real issues of getting drugs fast tracked for those in dire need who have little to lose.  See the film for some remarkable acting performances if nothing else.",1387324800,113,1884,4.706422018348624
6114855,5,B00GUO3C3W,"1985. A sexually active, straight, carousing, drug abusing Texas rodeo cowboy collapses. At the hospital he is told he has HIV and has less than thirty days to live. Does he succumb to the diagnosis, or does something else happen entirely?

Dallas Buyers Club is based on a true story about Ron Woodruff. I must admit I was unfamiliar with this movie. The ticket seller gave me an unconvincing outline, and I was about to walk away when a couple overhearing our conversation assured me it was a good movie.

I am glad to say they were correct. This is the exact type of movie that wins Oscars, and gets many nominations.

Matthew Mc Conaughey deserves to be nominated for playing someone battling a deadly disease who takes on big drugs and the FDA, to enable other sufferers like himself to have access to supplements and life saving drugs. He reputedly lost about 40 pounds for the role, and at times does look very gaunt, which gives an added layer of reality to his portrayal.

This is a multi faceted movie full of interesting characters, which operates on multiple levels at once. The personal struggle, the parallel struggles and contrasts, and the battle against different facets of authority. Jennifer Garner in a supporting role plays a feisty yet compassionate doctor, while a colleague with more of an eye to profit becomes a doctor shill for big drugs, which are experimental, still unproven, and in the clinical trial stage, and may have toxic side effects, while our protagonist has to chase down a caring and competent doctor in Mexico who was disbarred, for less toxic alternatives.

Why does one experimental method, with an unproven drug, take priority over drugs that are unapproved by the FDA? Aren't drugs undergoing clinical trials also unapproved? In both cases aren't people offering themselves as guinea pigs, and why shouldn't they be allowed to do that? After all, it is their lives.

I loved this movie, and I found the story far more engaging than I thought I would beforehand. I was particularly intrigued and a little surprised by how hard hitting it was against the FDA, and the role it plays in connection with the big pharmaceutical companies, and how it restricts our access even to harmless supplements.

I love it when a character is resourceful, so I loved the answers he gives an FDA official when he is stopped and questioned at the border.

As often happens in a movie of this nature, there is more than one great performance. An unrecognizable Jared Leto gives a breathtaking performance as a gaunt transgender woman also undergoing treatment who Ron meets, and who sources customers for him. Ray like others has to deal with Ron's homophobia, and it's refreshing to see how it plays out as the character develops. What I love is the journey the character makes through being confronted with his own mortality, and how that affects a wider circle of people.

If Leto does not get an Oscar nomination for his role then there is no justice in Hollywood. He would have to be a leading contender for Best Supporting Actor, as Matthew McConaughey would be for Best Actor.

One thing that has impressed me in recent years is McConaughey's transition from lightweight romcom, and pretty boy roles, to more challenging roles. For instance, I consider Lincoln Lawyer to be one of his best roles as a wheeler dealer lawyer but not the type of role for which an actor is typically nominated. He battles the system but has no weakness.

Actors win Oscars for playing two types of roles:

One is the psychopath, such as Daniel Day Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.

The second is actors battling disabilities or diseases and/or social injustice. Recently Octavia Spenser won for playing a maid dealing with racial discrimination, Meryl Streep for playing a Prime Minister battling alzheimers, and Christian Bale for playing a former boxer battling drug addiction. Jennifer Lawrence won playing a character battling grief who acts out sexually. Bradley Cooper was nominated for playing someone with bipolar disorder in the same movie. Jeff Bridges won an alcoholic country singer. More recently the trend has been moving toward playing real life characters.

As often happens the best movies of the year are released in December and timed for an Oscar run. I think most people will love it",1387324800,117,4397,4.853137516688919
6114856,5,B00GUO3C3W,"First, for the 2 principal actors to lose the weight necessary to reach their gaunt and HIV riddled character realities, is a constant utter amazement.  Second, were it not for the R rating derived from the true to life raunch in which the leads indulge, this movie would have no competitive peer as this year's best production.  Every minute of this work was spellbinding. filled with such character nuance and original drama that no other production comes close.  Interestingly, I saw ""12 Years a Slave"" the next day and almost walked out given the slow, undeveloped, repetitive imagery, compared to Dallas Buyers Club.  What is amazing is the breadth and integration of character depiction and development literally in every single personality on the screen throughout the film.  Each is absolutely engaged, complex and directed brilliantly.  The camera work is incomparable.  The sound track astounding!  The production stands at the highest point in what makes moviemaking the greatest human art. I urge any serious filmgoer, any person who starves for the most inspired human content and drama, any person who craves social significance and  unconditional political integrity to commit to seeing and sharing this masterpiece.  Such a work comes rarely and, as seems to be the case in Dallas Buyers Club, is way to strong for the opinion makers in our establishment to acknowledge for its importance and beauty.

6114857,4,B00GUO3C3W,"""Dallas Buyers Club"" (2013 release; 117 min.) brings the (real life) story of Ron Woodroof (played by Matthew McConaughey). As the movie opens, it is July, 1985 (we see a newspaper headline about Rock Hudson being outed with AIDS), and we are at a rodeo in Dallas where Woodroof is getting it on with two girls at the same time, while also placing bets on rodeo riders. A picture is quickly painted of Woodroof as the Texan wild and crazy guy. Yet soon we see him struggling, coughing and generally not feeling well and when he is admitted in the hospital, he gets the shocking news that he is HIV positive and is given only 30 days to live by the doctors. Woodroof goes ballistic and refuses to accept his fate, only to find that the FDA is allowing only one approved drug (ATZ) on the market. Woodroof eventually finds alternative medications in Mexico. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, let's talk about Matthew McConaughey's performance. He will simply blow you away. The very first shot of him (a head shot, in which he physically already looks terrible) is pretty shocking, to be honest (McConaughey reportedly lost 40 lbs. for the film). This role continue's McConaughey's recent string of top notch performances (Mud, Killer Joe, Bernie, The Paperboy, just to name those), and surely he will (or at least should) get strong consideration for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. (It just makes you wish that McConaughey wouldn't have wasted so many years playing those tiresome rom-com roles time and again.) Second, much has been said as well about Jared Leto's role. He first appears about 30 min. into the movie as the cross-gender dressing gay Rayon, to become Woodroof's business partner. It most certainly is a great performance (and is openly touted for Best Supporting Actor Oscar) but in my book, it doesn't come anywhere close to McConaughey's. Jennifer Garner has a small role as one of the Dallas Mercy hospital doctors, and gets completely blown away by both McConaughey and Leto. Third, this movie is most capably directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Caf de Flore"". Fourth, the movie does not put either the FDA or Big Pharma in a kind light, as we are given the impression that both are in cahoots and do not care what is best for the public at large (I have no idea to what extent this was or is the case). Last but not least, there is an excellent collection of songs featured in the movie, with many staples from the 1970s and 80s including a number of T Rex songs (Rayon is obsessed with T Rex's Marc Bolan). But beware: the movie soundtrack (which is available here on Amazon) features primarily music ""inspired by"", rather then ""from"" the movie, and is not an accurate reflection of what you hear in the movie.

""Dallas Buyers Club"" makes for an emotionally invested and moving experience that will tuck at your heart. But the acting performance from McConaughey is what makes this movie profoundly memorable. The screening I saw this act recently here in Cincinnati (where it's been playing already several weeks) was PACKED, leading me to think that this movie will find a larger audience, which is great news. Bottom line, ""Dallas Buyer's Club"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1386806400,234,3361,4.783132530120482

6114868,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Upon its November release there was no doubt that the long awaited and overdue first Academy Award nomination for Matthew McConaughey would arrive, strictly because it was easily his best performance to date. Five years ago, McConaughey was easily the most underrated actor of our times, and the films We Are Marshall; The Lincoln Lawyer; Magic Mike;Killer Joe; and Mud all testify to that statement. McConaughey carries us through the roller coaster emotions in combating terminal illness in the late 80s/early 90s. The setting couldn't be more perfect for 2013, in a time which we see the little man fighting the larger powers at hand. Everything about McConaugheys Ron Woodroof embodies the contemporary American spirit: a will to survive, love for the wild west, the acceptance of others, a very James Dean inspirited sense of rebellion, and the rejection of the 1% corporation all composed under the struggle with health care.",1514419200,,931,5.172185430463577

McConaughey and Leto Both won Oscars for best actor in this picture.  They both portrayed starved and dying AIDS patients, living outpatient in a Dallas Motel (see movie title), trying to get access to alternative forms of healthcare and medicine during the AIDS epidemic.  McConaughey contracts the virus while being a bull rider in rural Texas, doing cocaine and having a lot of sexual partners...usually prostitutes.  Leto himself plays the endearing ""Rayon,"" a flamboyantly gay drag queen who parted ways from an uptight and wealthy family to become a heroin addict and gay prostitute.  While McConaughey fights against his prejudice to work with Rayon and give Rayon access to his AIDS medications, they are also assisted by a young oncologist (Garner) working in the field of AIDS treatment, which at times seems hopeless throughout the film.  A truly gut wrenching year in film, and this one swept this Oscars.  Both actors' acceptance speeches were highly analyzed by viewers and film-critics alike.  12 Years A Slave won for best picture, after DBC won everything else. I was frustrated by that...that's why I don't work in Hollywood.  During McConaughey's Oscar acceptance speech, he spoke about how he envisioned his next ten years as an actor...and a lot of us thought he was talking about how much longer he had to live because his character in DBC was so real to us.",1510531200,,1515,5.00398406374502

6114964,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Excellent movie that is boosted by the fearless performances of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, both of whom are simply fantastic.  Unlike some modern ""method"" acting that becomes indulgently self-conscious (e.g., Jake Gyllenhaal in NightCrawlers), both McConaughey and Leto remain focused on the objects in their worlds (even when they are inner objects) and not on what great actors they are, if that makes sense.

Griffin Dunne's small but significant turn as Dr. Vass is a masterpiece - he creates a full, three-dimensional character in very few lines.

The film makes a couple of compromises - I think Jennifer Garner's role is woefully underwritten, and so we really don't gain insight into her character, which seems more plot device than flesh-and-blood entity.  As a result, the actress has little to work with, and some of her scenes seem contrived.

I also think that, when the movie shifts gears and shows, in a sort of extended montage, McConaughey's progression into a globe-trotting, international, high-stakes wheeler-dealer rubbing shoulders with major players in the Big Pharma game, you are left with a bit of whiplash.  How did he get from point ""A"" to Point ""Z"" in the blink of an eye?  The movie covers its tracks pretty deftly, but those leaps in just a few minutes remain a bit jolting and are a major departure from the pace at which the story unfolds in the first hour.

Additionally, there's a large dollop of the 1970s corporate America-as-the-most-malevolent-force-in-the-universe trope in the film, but at least it's tempered with an equal acknowledgment of government bureaucracy's inherent indifferent incompetence as well.

But these quibbles are pretty minor.  This is ultimately a movie about redemption, about our shared humanity, about how a person can grow and yet retain much of the individuality that makes him who he is.  It may be a bit obviously theatrically structured, like the ""well-made plays"" of the 19th century, but the power of this movie - aside from the fact that it's based on a fascinating real-life story - is in McConaughey's terrific performance as Ron Woodroof and the improbable relationship he forms with Jared Leto's equally wonderfully-rendered Rayon.",1482969600,7,2218,5.184873949579832

6114979,5,B00GUO3C3W,"One of the greatest in my opinion.  This movie removes the facade of what it's like to live on the other side of society.  Portrays perfectly what happens when society (and your close personal friends) exhibit judgement, without knowing the facts.  Matthew McConaughey's GREATEST roles, period.  Can't mention that without stating what a magnificent performance Jared Leto gave.  Both actors really make you ""feel"" every single emotion they are going through.  This movie will force you to feel a roller coaster of emotions, and at times, it's very difficult to watch.  But in the end, the emotion that stayed with me far after the movie is over, is love others wrecklessly.  It made me realize that it's not good to cloud your mind with judgement, or withhold forgiveness.  Remember, you never know what other people are going through.  Be merciful to other people, and earnestly love them, no matter what.",1480550400,5,907,4.986666666666666

I guess I would have liked it better if the main character would have been received more positively by the medical community instead of the threats they made to him and sending the FDA and the FBI after him.

Seeing how those before us struggled gives me even more reason to push for the support of PreP and PeP use. We owe it to those who tried so hard and gave so much.

More than that, it is a good story about a man who learns about another side of life through his disease. Unlikely friendships are forged, and a fight for his life becomes an entrepreneurial and principled endeavor. That's about as much as I'll say because I don't want to spoil too much.

I'd been wasting a lot of my credits by renting some really, really bad movies, some so bad I never even got hardly passed the first few minutes. This is one of those movies that makes you think...mostly about human strength and character. It's really amazing what just one person can do. I've seen the wreckage really, really bad people leave behind and you see movies about them way too much. There are so many movies about made up characters doing bad things and they sometimes leave me feeling really discouraged and sad about the human race.  But this movie is a refreshing change of pace. It's very inspirational and even though I felt kind of 'dirty' watching it at times, it still reminded me of what being a caring human is like. You don't have to look like Mother Teresa to be compassionate and be of help to those suffering. And unfortunately sometimes you have to play outside the rules, too. I had no idea how frustrating things must've been like for those suffering from HIV/AIDS in the early days and this movie opened up my eyes. It makes me thankful of how far we've come, even though we still have a long way to go, especially in certain communities.
Matthew McConaughey is barely recognizable in this role. I can't believe how much weight he lost to portray Ron Woodruff in the lead role. Jared Leto is great too. One of the better movies I've seen lately.",1457654400,,1514,4.505454545454546

The story was a bit iffy. Lots of things happening at a quickened pace. The characters are all a bit stereotyped. A southern redneck homophobe. An over the top cross dresser. Flamboyant gays. Heartless doctors and drug companies. All quite stereotyped. At times the movie was a bit too in your face. It's a bit silly to think this redneck type decided that gays are ""real people too"" so quickly. But I think the movie got it's point across effectively. The acting was pretty riveting. That is what saved it. The story was a bit cockeyed. No pun intended.

SPOILER ALERT:

I was a bit offended that it was only in the final credits that we learned the protagonist actually died in real life. That should have been in the film. And in real life if you grab a doctor in an angry way in the hospital, you go to jail, not back home. That was just goofy.",1451606400,,1012,4.321052631578947

Instead of developing characters with a well written screen play, Dallas Byers Club resorts to graphic and dark sex or drugged-out scenes for character development that will leave a dark mark on your soul.  Reminds me of the movie Monster but instead of making a beautiful actress gain weight to play the role of a bad person, Matthew reduced his body to bones.  His commitment to playing the role is respectful and his acting is impressive.  I question the motive for playing the role of a physically and spiritually sick man who throughout the entire film never really learns anything or has any redeeming qualities other than he is Matthew McConaughey and therefor charming and handsome.  The character continues to rely on sex and drugs to numb his pain from the beginning to the end with little transformation.  I wish I never saw this movie.  Powerful, yes.

6115210,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Juxtaposed a 1985 news headline revealing that Rock Hudson dies of AIDS is the sordid scene of Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaghey) having it off with two women, almost in public as he places a bet at the rodeo. Despite being painfully underweight, dogged by a hacking cough, hard living Texan, Ron Woodroof, isn't about to slow down, give away the girls, drink and drugs. Even after collapsing and stumbling into hospital then being told he has 30 days to live, half in denial he dismisses the doctors diagnoses and mounts an aggressive fight to firstly obtain the drug ATZ, the only medically approved drug. Disillusioned by the medical prognosis, red tape and impatient to evade imminent death staring him in the face, Woodroof is on a mission to stay alive. After meeting Rayon, a transgender patient, who is part of a medical trial with the drug ATZ, he suspends his homophobic attitudes and shows him tolerance.

Enraged by what Woodroof sums up as the hospitals incompetence and obfuscation he walks out of the hospital and heads to Mexico in search of alternative treatment and the possibility to stave off the disease indefinitely. Here he finds alternative medicine which gives him more than just hope. Partly transformed wild boy, Ron Woodroof, returns to Texas with an evangelical quest. Along with Rayon he forms a partnership to offer other AIDS sufferers more than just hope. When he sets up the Dallas Buyers Club to supply sufferers like himself with supplements and life-saving drugs he finds himself at loggerheads with orthodox medicine and the authorities. Undeterred he confronts the medical profession, wages war with it, continues to defy laws and regulations. Importing drugs from Japan, the Netherlands and China, rough diamond Woodroof circumvents the law without fear of potential consequences.

Dallas Buyers Club is a dark story and not for the faint hearted. Along with Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaghey), Rayon (Jared Leto) and compassionate doctor (Jennifer Garner) make for a stellar cast.",1447027200,,2019,5.133738601823708

Very impactful movie. Sad. Gritty. Well done. It's the type of movie that you walk out of the theater in silence because you are bombarded with so many thoughts and emotions, yet you can't articulate any of them well because you are also overwhelmed with shock.

However, it gives a vivid picture of a man who is cast out into the darkness by his friends he thought he knew to find new ones in his struggle for life itself.  AIDS is a diagnosis nobody wants to hear, especially in the 1980s, but Woodruff's triumph is that he finds a higher meaning to his life and opens his eyes to a whole new level of love and understanding.

6115281,1,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie, The Dallas Buyers Club is state propaganda designed to cover up mass murder. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were murdered with the deadly chemotherapy drug AZT. The government officials who did this hope to go to their graves without ever receiving justice for their terrible crimes.

What do Dr Kary Mullis (Winner of the Nobel prize), Dr Peter Duesberg ( one of the world's leading virologists and author of the book Inventing the AIDS Virus), and Dr Robert Willner (author of the book Deadly Deception the Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do Not Cause AIDS) have to say about HIV and AIDS?

They say that HIV does not cause AIDS and that AIDS is not sexually transmissible.
They say that the AIDS epidemic was almost completely isolated to promiscuous gay men until the government began prescribing the deadly drug AZT to everyone that they diagnosed with HIV.
They say that the vast majority of the gay men that died of AIDS before AZT was prescribed to anyone had been regularly using a drug called amyl nitrite. It was using this drug for years  that destroyed their immune systems. That's why AIDS was originally called GRID, Gay Related Immune Deficiency.
Now that no one is stupid enough to use amyl nitrite or take AZT, AIDS has all but disappeared. And people who happen to have the harmless antibodies to HIV in their system live like anybody else, as long as they don't take government prescribed poison.",1438128000,4,1434,4.774193548387097

but other than that, the story is hard to follow in terms of what exactly he is doing.  there was absolutely no reason to have him so rowdy, brutal and brutish all along.  the sidekicks (e.g. jared leto) are reasonably good but entirely in mcconaughey's shadow.  the actress lead role is rather forgettable.
all in all, all the pluses for this movie are due to mcconaughey, the rest is by no means anything special. from that point of view, oscars awarded for actors in the lead and supporting role and no awards for the other elements of the movie are absolutely in place.",1434931200,,700,4.666666666666667

If you weren't there at the time this came out, then look for the underlying hysteria that underlined it. This movie is more then just scripting and good acting, this is a movie that reminds us we have to take stands sometimes for the apathic way our institutions run at times where numbers and profits replace people.

6115466,5,B00GUO3C3W,"At the start of the AIDS crisis people knew little about the disease except that it was a virtual death sentence and that it seemed to be selectively affecting homosexuals and drug users. Doctors didn't know how to treat it, governments were slow to react, and large parts of society reacted by blaming the victims, and shunning them, instead of showing empathy. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a movie about empathy, set at this uncertain, pivotal moment in American history. Most movies are exercises in empathy, even when they don't mean to be, because they ask us to view stories from perspectives other than our own; this is one of the great strengths of the cinematic art form and one of the best proofs of its value. In ""Dallas Buyers Club"" the main character, a homophobic coke-head electrician and bullrider who lives in a trailer park (Matthew McConaughey), is the person we accompany through the early part of the AIDS saga. It is hard to imagine anyone coming to the end of the movie without respecting him, feeling for him, and liking him, even though few of the people who seek out a movie about the AIDS crisis are likely to be in sympathy with the hateful slurs or the self-destructive lifestyle that define him at the story's beginning. The movie is about his own journey toward empathy as well, and it is fascinating to notice how his unique perspective colors that journey and defines its limits.

One of the most remarkable consequences of the early AIDS era, and a recurring theme in the memoirs and narratives that have come out of that experience, was that many HIV-positive individuals took it upon themselves to become self-taught experts on the medicinal, scientific, financial, and legal issues surrounding their diagnosis. When hospitals and the FDA and the general public seemed helpless at best and apathetic at worse, communities emerged among those most affected that provided conduits for information and support, and in some cases used other-than- legal means to give desperate members access to untested, unapproved treatments. In this film, the titular Dallas Buyers Club is one such community. Its singleminded, brash, charismatic, lying, stealing, drinking, politically-incorrect leader is the Robin Hood of a ragtag band of individuals whose perspectives he does not share and cannot quite understand, but to whom he is intimately tied by a shared medical fate. The other person we, and he, know best is a transgendered and usually-stoned free spirit from the club scene named Rayon (Jared Leto), but there are glimpses of people from other walks of life as well, from the young and broke to an older, white collar couple in a committed relationship. The perspectives of medical professionals runs a similar gamut, from an unlicensed homeopathic type south of the border to a tool of Big Pharma to a concerned but cautious doctor played by Jennifer Garner. What is sobering is the realization that although all of these people want a cure, they come to the table with such different backgrounds and ideals that fighting each other is easier than fighting AIDS. McConaughey's character, on the phone with a doctor, pleads, ""I see where you're coming from, can you see where I'm coming from?"" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a movie about seeing where people are coming from, and a damn good one.",1423180800,,3317,4.955116696588869

6115523,2,B00GUO3C3W,"Ron Woodroof smuggled unapproved AIDS medicines from Mexico about 300 times after quitting his job as a licensed electrician in Dallas. His successes were aided by watching the U.S. checkpoint for routines, hunting for a numerical pattern. He and his girlfriend had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986, and he'd been given two years to live.

Ron also brings back interferon from Japan.

Nine major, primarily non-profit 'buyers clubs' spring up - the Dallas club carrying as many as 112 chemical unapproved for use in the U.S. The clubs sent drugs to labs for purity tests, and warn customers to use the products at their own risk.

Woodroof had 4,000 regular customers, and a reputation as the most risk-taking operator in the U.S. The underground is driven by paranoia that the FDA and drug-companies are conspiring to hold back supplies and boost profits.

Seven years after his diagnosis, Woodroof died.",1420329600,,911,5.053333333333334

Matthew McConaughey. What can I say? I have always found him to be a decent actor. I occasionally enjoy the cheesy rom-com. This movie, though. Wonderful. Perfect part for Matthew McConaughey. He was superb. Even when Ron was being as s*** in the movie, I loved him. I've never really actively avoided or actively sought out Jennifer Gardner. Feel more indifferent about her roles and acting skills. Feel the same way about her in this film. Jared Leto. Fabulous. I have felt ""eh"" about him, too, up until now. He did a great job.

Overall, the combination of accuracy of the feelings and situations experienced by those affected by HIV/AIDS, and the acting made the story come to life.",1419638400,,965,4.807228915662651

I worked as an AIDS Hospice Volunteer in the 90's and seeing firsthand the despair and loneliness experienced by these victims helped identify with the characters portrayed in this film. Extremely moving story with exceptional performances provided an educational and inspiring vehicle for audiences worldwide.

The transformation of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto was alarming as they were nearly unidentifiable. The dedication to their craft seemed unhealthy and did not feel these extremes were necessary to convey the plot. Matthew's take on this role hovered on overly theatrical which sometimes invalidated the plight of his character. Tone it down darlin'. Leto on the other hand totally nailed Rayon and he sure does make quite an impression of beauty, tragedy, and compassion.

The availability of medical information on HIV/AIDS at that time was so restricted and limited, it was a testament of the will to survive that he overcame his death sentence for seven years. I am not aware of all the facts behind the scenes but know of many others with Chronic Illness who became their own advocate in researching treatments outside of conventional methods to pursue cures or improve quality of life. A sad disheartening statement is presented that demonstrates the divergent paths of Big Pharma and the lone patient desperate for help.

The LGBT community was extremely organized and powerful in achieving great strides to provide access to drugs that addressed this illness. I would have liked to see more of how they impacted the success of their plight for assistance however, the main character was not in this category so perhaps more emphasis would be inconsistent.

It was gratifying to see a gradual acceptance by a straight man of the LGBT community despite his profit motive. There is much room for improvement even at this date.

Overall, an inspiring look at one man's mission to overcome FDA, IRS, and DEA regulations to help his fellow sufferers. High Recommend.",1416268800,,2027,5.164634146341464

I wouldn't watch it again--it was too dark, weird and too graphic with sex and open drug use.  This guy got aids from apparently open sex with people who were drug users or other indiscriminate sex lives while drunk or drugged up.  Very up close and personal to impact of smarmy lifestyles (drugging , drunkenness, and sex that results from both...filthy environments... not referring to homosexuality), drug addicts, and the prejudice towards people with aids--and their desperate plight to survive.  They have little help.  This story was also eye opening in the AIDS plight, and It also opened my eyes to how blatant prejudice is against people with AIDs and HIV, and those born (and ""out) as gay.  It was very realistic.  I would not watch it with kids.  The acting was very good and the plight shown was real.",1416009600,,984,4.735294117647059

Overall, the movie is heartbreaking, based on a true story and most good movies are based on real life events, so, I'd say it's a decent movie, worth paying the money to rent or even buy it. Although, it's not one of those movies that you would want to watch more than once. You know, when you find that special movie or movies that you can watch a million times if you want to, they never get old, some of my favorites are the Breakfast Club or the Harry Potter movies, amongst others, this is not one of those movies.

6115745,3,B00GUO3C3W,"Don't get what all the hype was about with regards to acting.  The history of it is admirable, but I wouldn't have given it the acting accolades it received just because Matthew lost so much wright for the part.",1410652800,,211,4.410256410256411
6115746,5,B00GUO3C3W,"""Dallas Buyers Club"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Real-life cowboy Ron Woodroof's free-wheeling life was upended in 1985 when he was diagnosed as HIV-positive and given 30 days to live. Shunned by many of his old friends and bereft of government-approved effective medicines, Ron decided to take matters in his own hands, tracking down alternative treatments from all over the world by means both legal and illegal. Bypassing the establishment, the entrepreneurial Woodroof joined forces with an unlikely band of renegades and outcasts, establishing a hugely successful buyers' club.

The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (in an impressively, well-crafted, well-done Oscar-winning (Best Actor) performance as Ron Woodroof), Jennifer Garner (as Eve) & Jared Leto (just as impressive in a Oscar-winning (Best Supporting Actor) performance as Rayon) is brilliant. The directing by Jean-Marc Vallee (also co-edited the film) is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Craig Borten & Melisa Wallack is brilliant.

The cinematography by Yves Belanger is brilliant. The film editing by Martin Pensa & Vallee is brilliant. The casting by Kerry Barden, Rich Delia & Paul Schnee is brilliant. The production design by John Paino is brilliant. The art direction by Javiera Varas is brilliant. The set decoration by Robert Covelman, set dressings by Duane E. Burcham, Zachary Dickerson, Mike Fitzgerald, Jordan Lightner, Kyle S. Plowden & Ellis Powell is brilliant. The costume design by Kurt and Bart is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) make-up by Robin Mathews & the (Oscar-winning) hairstyles by Adruitha Lee is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Katie Riggs is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Nathalie Lanthier & Annic Rivest, supervised by Marc Cote & Martin Leduc is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Alex Terzieff is brilliant.

This is a well-done, well-crafted movie that is entertaining and impressive. Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto are impressive in their Oscar-winning performances and lead a well-rounded supporting cast. This was one of the best movies of the last holiday season and also one of the best movies of last year, as well. This was also a well-deserved awards contender, as well, too.",1410652800,,2235,5.435158501440922

6115769,2,B00GUO3C3W,"First off, let's get it straight that for my money, Jared Leto is the best actor in this movie. Hot as a burger skillet in Waco on the fourth of July.  McConaughey plays the Tough Texan who Goes Against the System to expose the Evil Corporations who are willingly Ruining Peoples Lives so they can Make Money off the poor, the sick and the dying. Maybe true. However, in classic Hollywood fashion, the elements of the story are cartoonized, skipping over salient parts to emphasize the Fight Against the Empire of money grubbing corporations to identify with the Little Guy who Fought and Won. In real life, so much happens in the gray areas that watching a story of this sort made me a little queasy, especially with the prettification of the main character, a man who banged once too many times and paid the price. Too bad character development wasn't a part of the script.",1409875200,,875,4.608974358974359

This is definitely a story that needed to be told, I just wish they would have been more historically accurate.  Having worked with HIV patients for nearly 2 decades now, I was disappointed at all of the inaccuracies.  I know that the filmmakers can take poetic license but this film should not have been touted as ""based on true events"", as it does not reflect the actual events.  The filmmakers basically took the main character's name, diagnosis and the fact that there was a buyer's club and then created a fictional movie around it.  Unfortunately, it was a missed opportunity. The true story was just as engaging, they didn't need to fictionalize or sensationalize so much.

6115872,3,B00GUO3C3W,"I was disappointed in this much hyped film.  The acting was wonderful though a great deal  of McConnahay's performance was due to his shocking appearance.  I thought the film jumped around too much.  There was little continuity.  One scene shows him rolling in money then he is busted and loses all his drugs then first thing you know he has plenty of drugs again and the whole thing repeats itself.  In one scene he seems to be feeling great then all of a sudden he is unconscious on the floor and back in the hospital.  Yes, I got the message about the system failing these very sick people because of the very hit and miss drug treatment that actually killed some of them.  I just think the film could have been a lot better.  I was actually involved in the AIDS scene in the early 80s as my husband was one of the very first volunteers in this area who helped to take care of those that had no family to help them.  Before they were able to get government assistance.  I knew very well some of the very first doctors who treated AIDS patients.  So, I know what the atmosphere was at that time.  I think this would have been a better film if it had been directed by someone who could put it together in a way that people could relate to instead of this choppy mess.",1407456000,,1268,4.2552301255230125

6115893,2,B00GUO3C3W,"Take away the gimmick of McConaughey's weight loss and I believe this weak movie would not have had the audience that it had. I found it boring, repetitive, predictable, poorly-acted, and hokey. I am sorry to say that by seeing this to the end I violated my 10 to 15 minute rule which dictates that if a film is not grabbing me within that time frame it never will.

A major mistake was made by having the main character completely unlikeable. I felt nothing for him. Unlike other viewers, the sex did not bother me one bit. What bothered me was his continuing to have casual sex even after his diagnosis. Not once did we see him attempting to notify a former sex partner. We saw him denying help to people who didn't have enough money to join his club. The ending was ridiculous and goofy.

I'd really like to see an end to the use of hand-held cameras and have actors return to speaking their lines so that those of us who are native English speakers can understand them.

6115902,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey played Ron Woodroof and was awarded Best Actor Oscar. Jared Leto was, Rayon, a transgendered individual, and earned Best Supporting Oscar. Ron was informed by his doctor that he had been infected with HIV, and ""we estimate that you have 30 days left to put your affairs in order."" He goes on a marathon search for information about HIV. He read the latest research and became well versed in the scientific literature. He learned that the FDA was testing Zidovudine (AZT) in experimental trials on patients. AZT was known at the time for its use to treat cancer but was shelved due to a lack of efficacy and its toxicity. Along with eradicating the virus, AZT kills all cells it makes contact with, including healthy ones. Ron overdosed on AZT, which he obtained illegally, and ended up in the hospital getting a blood transfusion to save his life. He met, Rayon, in the same room they were sharing. She attempted to befriend him, but he had a homophobic reaction and tried to avoid her. She was unrelenting in her appeal for his acceptance. He gradually reevaluated his stereotype of her and grew to respect and care about her. Ron and Rayon formed the DBC which was modeled after a similar club in New York. The club charged a membership fee and then provided pharmaceutical drugs such as Interferon to HIV patients. By charging a membership, he claimed he was giving the drugs away (not selling them) and bypassing a legal technicality. Interferon, a promising drug, had not yet been approved in the U.S. The terminally ill did not have the 8-12 years it would take for the FDA to complete their studies. So, Ron traveled to Japan, Amsterdam, China, and Israel to acquire these pharmaceuticals for them. An outstanding presentation of a segment of our society; however, it is for an adult audience due to profane language, drug use, and sexual content. To date, 25 million have died from HIV and 33 million are living with it. There are more than 6 thousand new infections daily, worldwide. In the U.S., there are over a million living with HIV and these are just the reported cases. HIV attacks and replicates inside white blood cells known as CD4 T lymphocytes (T-helper cells) involved in the immune response and this impairs the immune system from fighting infections and certain forms of cancer. HIV can destroy more than a billion CD4 cells daily. The immune system gradually declines with reduced numbers of CD4 cells and the patient gets opportunistic infections (they would not get with a healthy immune system). Typically, the number of CD4 cells is greater than 500 cells per milliliter. When the cell count falls under 200 per milliliter, infections occur such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, cryptococcal fungal meningitis, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma. Fortunately, with antiretroviral therapy (ART), these opportunistic infections can be avoided, because the AIDS virus is kept under control at a low level as seen with basketball player Magic Johnson.",1407024000,,3006,4.942687747035573

I was a nurse in Texas, where this takes place, during those times and worked with Aids and HIV patients in a city hit very hard. This brought back so much sadness and the feelings of helplessness that we all felt for the first decade of Aids. It just hit too close to home. Even not finishing the movie found me thinking about it and those times for days. I was a theater goer and volunteer in theater and had acquaintances outside of theater and work that suffered directly. I saw how Aids devastated lives and industries and this just put me back there. I did not realize the emotions and memories that this would re-kindle. Actually, I guess I was so busy with the tragedy I did not realize my emotions and the toll fully even back then. However, all the tragedy  of young people and so many being affected spurred some good things that society and culture needed to recognize and deal with. impetus for society to wake up and realize that there is nothing wrong homosexuals, it is what is;  opened us up more to end of life decision making; opened us up to the benefits of hospice.",1406851200,,1194,4.302222222222222

6115936,5,B00GUO3C3W,"All the prizes and awards are well deserved for Jared Leto and Matthew Mcconaughey who alone are the reason for watching this film. A remarkable film which almost never got made but we are glad that it did.
McConaughey is Ron Woodruf, a vulgar, mean rodeo type of character who is in to sex with many women, gambling, alcohol, fighting and gambling. An accidental electrocution sends him to the ER when his blood samples reveal that he has the AIDS virus and only thirty days to live. Being diagnosed with AIDS may not seem a big deal today but this movie is set in 1985, a time when such a diagnosis almost certainly meant death. But Woodruff won't give up easily and finds a janitor at the hospital to give him supplies of AZT, an experimental drug. When the janitor fails to produce AZT, he goes to Mexico to seek the help of a American physician who recommends a diet of vitamins and fatty acids. As his condition stabilizes. Ron decides to start a club with a 400 dollar enrollment fee to help others by buying medicines from the border.
Mathew McConaughey is just amazing as Woodruff, as the drug addled sleazeball who finally comes in term with his own mortality. Here is an actor who almost faded away because of  his movie choices that enhanced cheesiness than chops. However the actor in him has woken up and we have seen in great movies such as Mud and Wolf of Wall Street. For this movie he lost almost 47 pounds to look the part. He starts out as a mean, menacing guy who deserves some punishment but towards the end he gains the respect and love of the audience. He was simply that good. A evil person who finally learns to love and to connect with humans.
Another actor who is almost unrecognizable in drag,  but fantastic,  in drag is Jared Leto. He and Mcconaughey share an unbeatable chemistry. Leto is a transsexual and becomes a business partner to a reluctant Woodruff.  This is the fifth movie to win best actor & best supporting actor Oscars (for Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto)
Dallas buyers Club is a sparkling cocktail of chemistry between the two leads who bring life to the AIDS epidemic but also highlight the struggle of the individual against the goliaths such as big pharma, government and the epidemic itself. They are simply amazing.",1406419200,,2269,4.58128078817734

6115968,3,B00GUO3C3W,"The first scene of Dallas Buyers Club is disorienting, immediately confounding the viewer with obscured vision, indecipherable gasps, and lack of context. The next several scenes are similarly abrupt, provocative, and compelling. It sets the stage for what feels like a film.

Turns out your gut reaction is wrong, though. This movie, while starting with promise, winds out to be your typical sentimentalist junk about the AIDS crisis during the 1980s. I don't mean to sound heartless or uncaring, but weve seen plenty of movies like this before.

Based on true events, Dallas Buyers Club is the story of an odd couple of a homophobic loser joining forces with a transgender woman to deal, and eventually set up a business, to distribute medication which alleviates the symptoms of AIDS. Each has their own selfish reasons for entering into this arrangement (elements which I think make the story compelling), but it predictably falls into the sappy selflessness youd expect. This is truly the stuff Oscar dreams are made of.

I don't mean to say this movie was terrible, but it certainly wasn't good. If the events in the film are all true ones (which, for all I know, they may have been), they certainly weren't set up well enough. For instance, Matthew McConaugheys Ron Woodroof is somehow able to break through his first con job, as a cancer-stricken priest, without breaking a sweat Its suspending a lot of disbelief that, given the devastating circumstances of being HIV+, Woodroof can all of a sudden develop alternate personae faster than Thats So Raven.

Lazy touches like this make the film overall underwhelming for me. Its not a particularly interesting movie, and I find it inconceivable how it has drawn such praise. Dallas Buyers Club gives you exactly what you expect, which in my opinion is pointless art.",1405987200,,1822,4.983552631578948

I guess it was b/c I wanted to see what made this movie so special that it received so many accolades during this past Awards season. While there were several scenes that were very graphic in nature, they helped to emphasize the truth of how this story unfolded. Unbridled sex, drug use profane language, it all reveals the dark side that living this lifestyle creates. The consequences are plain for all to see but at the same time, you feel empathy for the devastation these characters have brought upon themselves. Matthew & Jared & the whole cast will have you believing they really went through this themselves. The physical changes in their bodies as this disease progressed were amazing. I have to commend them for the obvious punishment their bodies endured to achieve the emaciated effect we see in this film. It was like they became the people they portrayed.

I did learn about the AIDS complications in the 1980s, and how people tried to find (illegal) medicines to counter the devastating effects of the disease.  The part about the pharmaceutical companies enticing hospitals to do drug trials with offers of big money, is entirely true.  As is the hospital committees who turned their backs on ethical considerations when money is the reward.  However, I found the movie morose overall.  Since my main motivation for watching movies these days is purely for entertainment, I just couldn't stick with this one.

grief filled days.  I worked with about 35 folks stricken with this disease and watched the majority die within a couple of years...
particularly the folks who obediently consumed the AZT.
  This movie packs a wallop of emotion due to brilliant acting, real life subject matter, and smart editing, directing, sets, and
perfect casting.  Even if you think you can't stomach another story on HIV/Aids...give this a try.  It has  a big human interest
message and is  historically and painfully accurate.

6116052,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConnaughey gives the best performance of his career yet in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, the story of Ron Woodruff and his struggle to obtain medicine, legal or otherwise, for his AIDS. There was also outstanding supporting work by Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who played a transgender AIDS patient named Rayon. When the movie begins, we are introduced to Ron Woodruff, a hard-drinking, sex-crazed, racist and homophobic man whose life is falling apart. As time progresses, he makes a gradual change to becoming a man who values his (and others') lives more due to his illness. He is also a man who doesn't give up or give in, as evidenced by his multiple run-ins with the FDA and the DEA, and symbolized by the final frames of the film. And more than anything, that is what I think the movie is about: overcoming when the odds are against you. This is a powerful and moving story, based in fact, which deserved every award it received at the Oscars. Matthew McConnaughey, on somewhat of a winning streak lately, put in some of his finest work here and went the extra mile by making a significant physical transformation to inhabit the character and person of Ron Woodruff. Jared Leto also deserves mention in this regard for his transformation as well. Jennifer Garner also does well as Ron's doctor and (eventual) friend, one of the few people not afflicted with AIDS who sees his plight and tries to help him. Her performance was imbued with a certain kindness and gentleness which I found rather appealing. As far as technical qualities are concerned, Jean-Marc Vallee did a great job directing, the cinematography was excellent and I thought that the music was good as well. There's really nothing to complain about with this film at all. Sure, it might have been Oscar bait, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this was one of the best films of 2013.",1404691200,,1867,4.747692307692308

6116082,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Wow, really thought provoking. All the actors were so good.
An amazing story of the transformation of a person who finds out they have HIV and only 30 days to live. I think the obvious discussion on this movie is what it says about our health care system, the FDA, our government. Before I get to that, I just want to comment on that transformation. Matthew played this role so well, he was truly amazing. I loved how much his character changed throughout the movie. Before you say well yeah he was given 30 days to live, of course he changed.. I think we all know people who get a sentence like that and either give up or ignore it. Really inspiring character, loved the transformation.

Then there is the FDA in this movie. Wow. I don't think of myself as someone who believes every conspiracy theory about the government, but the story told in this movie is one I have always struggled with. I DO believe that some pharmaceutical company out there has the cure for cancer, or AIDS, or something sitting on their shelf. Too much money is made on these diseases. Big pharm and the health care system make too much money on cancer, AIDS, and countless other ""incurables"". If I was told I had an incurable disease with X amount of time left. You bet I would be on every experimental treatment I could find. The scene when he was in the grocery store talking about living clean and not wanting anything with preservatives in it... I don't trust the FDA. I don't trust the crap that passes for ""food"" that is sold so cheaply in every store in the US. Clean, natural food is expensive and harder to find. It makes me sick.

This movie was well acted, thought provoking, not great entertainment. I think of would of actually rather read about this in a book with a lot more detail, than seeing it as a movie. As entertainment is was slow. But I really liked the story, I was fascinated to see what happened. I think everyone should see this and question what happened.",1404000000,,1963,4.45

This characters lifestyle, both before and after his diagnosis, is something I can't relate to.  In fact, I really had no idea that people lived like this.

Seeing as how this is not a documentary, neither of those complaints matters because this is one of the best acted films in years. The beautiful dignity put into Rayon by Leto is heartbreaking and humorous, as is McConaughey's determination as Woodruffe to find proper medical care for a disease no one understood or could handle in the early 1980s. After a number of documentaries and the revival of The Normal Heart, all generally focused on urban areas like San Francisco and New York, seeing how it affected people outside of gay areas is just as important.

6116174,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Welcome to the 1980s. A decade of excess and limited consequences, where every desire can be fulfilled if you're daring enough and your cash holds out. Or so it seems to Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a hard drinking cowboy with a penchant for anonymous sex, hard drugs, and bull riding. When he has an accident at work and is sent to the hospital, he discovers the real price for his hedonistic lifestylehe has HIV, and he only has thirty days to live.

Ron researches his condition. He discovers, to his amazement, that not just the Tinkerbells can contract HIV. He also finds that there is a drug available for testing that may help, but it is not for sale. Soon he embarks upon a journey that will take him through the most dangerous circles of black market prescription drugs and will reveal the seamy relationship between corporations and government, but it is also an adventure that will change his outlook on the disease itself and its sufferers.

In Ron Woodroof, we have the least sympathetic of protagonists. A homophobe, a womanizer, an alcoholic, an abusive little man with scant thought for how to do anything with his life other than get laid and get high. And somehow, director Jean-Marc Vallee and company have made a movie that not only causes us to slowly come to cheer him on, but somehow does not let us forget what he truly is on the inside. To give us reasons to not forget his sins but, in remembering them, exult in his cause is a hard task to perform. The viewer is at once repulsed by him and, by stages, sympathetic with his plight and his changes in character.

To be sure, the movie is a tad unevenly biased. There is not one unsympathetic homosexual character, while any character who does not instantly scream by their presence I AM ON YOUR SIDE is played off as barely human.  But that is minute compared to what the movie does right. Yes, the film has an agenda, and it announces itself with a bullhorn, but at least there is a clear direction and a Dramatis Personae that carries it off without being belaboring and insulting.

The Dallas Buyers Club is a strange item. Challenged by being based on a true story, but having to follow scripting conventions. Having a larger purpose, but falling victim to certain movie clichs. An odd marketing campaign that has no trust in the material itself, but rather plays the film off as a lark. Ignoring all of this, it is nearly impossible to not see the work at its heart. The Dallas Buyers Club is a modern day Philadelphia. Though it does not have as much of an emotional punch as Philadelphia, it manages to stand on its own merits as though that movie never even existed. Here is a film that tackles far more than a discussion about HIV and AIDS and moves on into corporate lobbying, the corruption of money on politics, and the human element that tends to get lost in the political and judicial process. Those involved in this enterprise should be proud of the work they have done.",1401926400,,2968,4.571428571428571

His performance as an AIDS stricken Ron Woodroof can be only compared to Christian Bale's portrayal of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist (2004).  I think by now, McConaughey has a patent for playing southern or mid-western characters (aka typical American men of the region) who are either enforcing the law or breaking it.

I was rooting also for Jared Leto, who won the best supporting actor award for his amazing performance as the transsexual, Rayon.  The movie is based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, a hard-partying redneck rodeo cowboy who discovers he is HIV-infected.  This was in the 1980s when many began dying with AIDS and the availability of drugs was complicated by lack of research and prejudice against gays.  Woodroof explored every option and in Mexico found alternative drugs, which he sold in his Buyers Club.  He had to fight legal battles as well as fight to live, and in the process he became an activist and aligned with Rayon as his assistant.  The gift of the film is that it tells a piece of history in a non-sentimental style and yet captures the poetry of the lives of those who lived it.  A fine film.",1401494400,,1014,4.538461538461538

Having lived in California during the dark days of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and having many friends who were affected by the disease, I understand the devastation our community suffered before effective treatments were discovered.

Sad to say, but a lot of this ignorance still exists today. It's unfortunate that the FDA takes so long to test and approve new drugs that are already approved in other countries. Then, when they finally do approve them, the cost is so outrageously high that most people cannot afford to take it.

I think as humans we wonder what we would do when faced with such a prognosis, I only hope I'm every bit as bad ass as Ron was.

What is suprising is the well-documented story on how the FDA can stop actual, regular Americans who are only trying to get simple relief from a terminal disease, or what was terminal then.
Yes, the story to me was all too familiar. My co worker and friend died in '83. And even now, people cant even be sure if we wil be ALLOWED to buy simple supplements, year to year. The holy FDA dares to tell the media that THEY are looking out for us. (When do they do that) No, they just want to control a great industry, in order to jack the prices up, and get into the action. And under the table campaign funds from pharmaceuticals, who would compete for dominance, not directly with the FDA but laws must be made to stop the free market. FDA can get paid off though. There are always needs to slip chemicals in, with untested effects, and try to impress buyers -with patents.
True, some supplements being sold are cheesy hoaxes. But most of us learn to ask questions, listen to experts, don't take everything as fact. Our dietary needs and help with arthritis, and all other diseases without cures are all being addressed openly, on air and in stores.  The FDA is not prepared to even begin to catch up on the sophistication of the thousands of years of background and continual refinements being done without dirty hands making it expensive and yet profitable for ultra-rich, interested investors. The FDA is already bought out by the food INDUSTRY and the pharmaceuticals. We got sicker and poorer. I have fought health problems most of my life, including chemical sensitivities that almost killed me, left my immune system weak, and only now is more commonly discussed instead of doubted as legit, documented heavily for decades. Pharmaceuticals and foods, and environmental causes are not profitable, no fast bucks here.  But what is allowed to be added  to food and not even labeled is horrific.  Now, its said 80% of foods sold are GMO foods. Fresh foods from the ground and animals we always ate, are now modified to get big freakishly fast, and sit in your fridge for months.  Tested? oh ha ha. Are we ever allowed to just say NO? no. I DIGRESS..the long arm of the FDA is like a horror movie, only we are victims and we are real.
At any rate, this movie is a suprise in the story of how some of the best treatments for HIV were not exactly available above capped dosing limits. Other treatments were not allowed to be prescribed or sold in the USA. / Even though they  helped people in agony, dying. The /wrong people were sick after all.
This is a wrenchingly well done story to some, if not many of us, who were alive and recall living through of the early days of the HIV scare, when nothing was known and all the hateful separation, blame, and wild rumors on the causes was still pretty common. Some things change, most of our expectations of safe food and affordable prescriptions has gotten horribly worse. The chemical laden farms are industrialized, and so anti-organic. Corn farmers are being subsidized for the corn syrup industry?! and of course, corn syrup has a chokehold on the food industry, and so highly addictive, proven to cause bloated guts, ruin digestion, (weight gain) , AND increase your appetite. Takes weeks of fight to quit. Illegal in Europe. Here, we give farmers bonuses for a crop that needs little help to grow OR SELL. Why not shove corn in Ethanol and not humans.
Matthew has an intensely heroic tale to tell as  one of the central people in getting HIV medications to the masses of victims. He was a tough atypical Texan, but became an American hero, when he went on an endless mission to find help instead of hate.
He went to extremes to help others, not just himself, to get simple HIV treatments from Mexico to share with people he did not know and did not initially cotton to, and what a story it is. He fought the law. He got busted. He got beaten down badly. He fought left and right, and- changed his own ideas along the way too.
You don't need to know much about those times, but the story is important to anyone who ever need unreleased, new medicines to be accessable to those who are terminal or just too miserable- to not take huge risks. (now we can get drugs that cause death, among other side effects, if we have money ) You can not judge the right or wrong of taking massive risks on untested drugs, unless it happens to you, or someone very, very close to you. Even if fear of loss is killing those that surround a patient, the patient is the one who should decide what to try, when to stop.
As far as hating goes, there is  the story of hope in this great movie. Matthew brought lots of people into his home and his club, and when his mind was opened in a great, American hero, way, you love this goofball character. This movie sends a great message, with people standing up and being counted when they want a chance at life, cant travel to other countries, and cant afford insane costs.
Made me consider that this country never had this sort of wild west pricing until recent decades. when disease is taking over more, and in chillingly more cases, anti-biotics don't work anymore. People walking away from drugstore counters, faces down, cant afford. We never let people suffer or die without meds because they were too expensive.
So maybe this movie will remind some, and others will learn just how hard it was back then. The truth that we have a bigger, long fight to get the FDA back to what its PAID to do, to look out for citizens, not the pharmaceutical companies and the top/wealthy ~investors~ in these blood sucker corporations.  Since it IS the government who finances most of THEIR massivey expensive RESEARCH on new drugs. The drug lord-pharmaceuticals act like they deserve massive profits for SELLING the drugs that our tax dollars actually created.  /FIve stars for reality at its worst and its absolute best.

Set in 1985 at the height of the AIDs phobia it's really about the government being in bed with the pharmaceutical companies. It's well told and well acted.

I have to say this didn't sound like a movie I'd want to see but my brother told me it was one of his favorite movies. I gave it a try and it's now one of my favorite movies too. It's not shoving liberal ideas down your throat it's showing how a drug company with enough dollars can hand out dangerous drugs with the approval of our government knowing they are killing people.

6116316,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Some awkward acting and clumsy plot lines mar this tour de force
The creation of a female doctor as a sympathetic foil, who barely winces when her prescription pad is stolen and a stereotypical doctor as obstacle in collusion with the drug companies is also an example of some of the places this movie does a glib distortion of both science, politics and practice of early Aids crisis, as unexplained in the movie AZT eventually became a primary past of the cocktail that turned death sentence around over the next decade.
So it is surprising in a film that has two extraordinary performances, as validated by Oscars for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, that some of the supporting roles are thin, hackneyed or inaccurate
That critique does not cancel the movie's many strengths and accomplishments
The movie hangs on the skinny shoulders of McConaughey and Leto, inhabiting the edges of their pride, confidence and despair
That cocktail is the aggressive tone of the film, from the stall grit sex and bull ride that opens the film, to the reappearing image of the bobbing clown, the farce and ferocity will to live, the lies, the con jobs, the clever deals across the borders of acceptable characterize the time and the nerve and velocities of contradiction and acts of human kindness representing the millions of similar stories that don't make it to the big screen. The movie also forces the question of the story Hollywood chooses to tell and accurate history. Why was a real person made heroic (albeit often ridiculous, but willing to buck the system, and ride the bull as long as he can) but turned into a homophobe? If it's to heighten good story telling call it fiction, not this convenient collage of elements drawn from history but twisted for dramatic effect.

6116336,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I lost a cousin to AIDS who could have greatly benefited from the supplement regime in this movie. Sadly, his father worked for what should have been the best of all places, a major pharmaceutical company. He believed in the flawed system shown in this film. Watch this for the great acting and the great information.

Our access to a variety of supplements and natural products like raw milk and cheese from local farmers is being taken away from us by an FDA/USDA run for the purposes of major drug, agricultural and biotech companies. This film shows one of the many tragic results. When it comes to food and drugs, I believe in informed consent, not bans and fines. Seeing this film will teach you a lot about the dangers of letting drug companies supersede human rights.  If you want more info on the plot, there are many reviews here that give you that. I think it is such a wonderful educational opportunity that I want to comment mostly on the FDA aspect. Please note that this review will likely receive negative comments touting  the wonders of the FDA . There are people paid to do that and I have seen them show up every time big pharma is questioned. I don't get paid to answer them and won't waste my time.

I'm surprised that Big Pharma allowed this film to be made. They are THAT powerful. As coincidence would have it, I finally got around to watching it shortly after learning that it had long been known, in another country, that a substance in Soy could treat AIDS. Note that is REAL SOY, not the GMO, ""Round Up Ready"", stuff we have here which is rich in pesticide residue. Why were we not told about this years ago?? Who is REALLY protecting our health and well-being. Certainly NOT the FDA. As this film shows, it only protects the drug patents of major U.S. manufacturers and biotech companies and much of medicine supports it for financial gain.

Only last week, the FDA had approved a pain killer so lethal that states are now moving to ban it. How protective of human life is that?? If you don't already know, the FDA with its Corporate Dons, like former policy maker for Monsanto Micheal Taylor, (over food) and  Virginia Weldon (former Monsanto VP for public policy) now on the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee have been running a virtual war on supplements for decades.

The reason is simple. Many of them work really well and most are from natural products which have to be synthesized to be patented. If they haven't figured out how to defy nature (the process of synthesizing often has side effects not present in the original) they don't want to see a natural drug that works on the market.  It is also easy to dissuade people from using them because most natural remedies work over time and don't have the immediate punch the pharmaceutical companies like to advertise. But your body doesn't like to be ""punched"". The movie illustrates that very well as the effects of AZT devastate patients in the early trials...This while the medical industry, which benefits financially from participation in these studies...gladly touted their worth...least they not be asked to do another.

Symptomatic treatments that do nothing to enhance the body's immune system or replace vital nutrients do not create health. They create drug dependence. In a truly free society, informed consent would be the norm. Now go watch the film and tell your friends to watch it too.",1399593600,,3414,4.714765100671141

6116348,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Ron Woodroof is a hard working and hard playing kind of Texas cowboy. He works as an electrician and at the rodeo. He is a real woman's man and he is very promiscuous. He is hurt one day at work and wakes up in the hospital. Doctors come in wearing masks to advise him that he has the HIV virus and that he has 30 days to live......

Matthew McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof and Jarad Leto plays Rayon and both are dying of Aids. They become friends even though they have vastly different lifestyles and sexual beliefs. They both looked at the verge of death due to the weight they had lost to do the roles and their acting was superb. The Academy Awards proved the point. This is based on a true story of Ron's fight against the medical profession and the FDA to speed up and provide the right drugs to help dying aids patients.

Ron had to overcome his homophobia and prejudice and realize that all of the Aids victims were in the same boat as he was. Condemned to death by an incurable disease and by the medical profession's slow moving research into a lethal disease. His point was, ""Who cares if the treatment is risky, we are all dying.""

This movie isn't for everyone as it is very outgoing into Ron's sex life and very graphic. It is an excellent film and the acting is just over the top. Jennifer Garner plays Dr. Saks and she does a great job in that role as well. The film is set in Dallas in 1985 and it is interesting to see the indifference of the medical industry and people in general to the Aids epidemic since is was perceived to be a disease of drug users and the gay community.

It is a sad movie and depressing at times as people die and waste away. The medical industry is pushing the AZT drug treatment and it seems to be killing people faster instead of helping them. Ron struggles to find ways to treat the virus and to relieve the numerous symptoms of the disease. This is a good insight into the life of those struggling with Aids and the HIV virus.

The ups and downs of the main characters show what a flood of individuals went through during the time when HIV drugs weren't readily available or distributed.  Bravo to performances by Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner.  But be prepared to have your emotions toyed with as the movie will pull at your heart strings.  You don't have to be gay to enjoy this movie.  You do however need an open mind to understand how a Straight Man had to deal with a disease which had been Labeled as a Gay Disease.

6116379,1,B00GUO3C3W,""" HEY!  Look over here!  I got disturbingly thin, I say F... every other word and there are lots of grimy sex scenes in this movie.  Maybe you won't notice that this movie is crap but I am trying to be a serious actor and make some money.""

This film is based on the drug smuggling operation in the mid-1980's, instigated by  Ron Woodroof, described as a homophobe desperate to save himself after destroying his body with  drink, drugs and lots of unprotected sex with prostitutes. Diagnosed with AIDS, Woodroof, played by McConaughey, supposedly, ultimately pitted himself against the callous medical establishment and became the Robin Hood expert of experimental drugs he obtained illegally in other countries, which he then sold to desperate AIDS/HIV patients in Dallas. Given 30 days to live after his initial diagnosis, Woodroof supposedly survived for 7 years by self-medicating and avoiding toxic AZT, then in the experimental stages. Take that all you M.D.s and FDA.
 McConaughey also tries to sell us an ""epiphany"" to show that Woodroof began to truly care for the tragic parade of gays, transexuals, prostitutes and drug addicts lined up on his doorstep to buy and ingest anything that might save them. The film invents a key character in Woodroof's life, a stunningly beautiful Jared Leto as a drag queen ""Rayon"" , who partners with Woodroof to bring in the gay customers.  ""Rayon"" is completely fictional. This ""epiphany"" never happened. Leto, however, is captivating and the only thing of interest in the film.

Admittedly, I have always disliked McConaughey's minimal acting skills, exaggerated drawl , and fascination with strippers, drugs and the seamiest side of life. He must write into his contracts that he gets to drop the F-bomb every 10 seconds. He has become a mainstream ""porn"" star, obsessed with filming his own image thin or buff, and frequently almost nude.  (Check out his male stripper movie to see the buff version if that floats your boat.) Brilliantly, he got more publicity for this movie by getting skeletal than for the substance of the material.  Still, it is impressive how he (and many, many untalented actors and musicians) grasp that repulsive characters and XXXXX rated material will get you great press and maybe some awards. Critics will fawn over drivel and the public will hold their noses to cringe through this disgusting film that purports to be bringing a meaningful topic to light (i.e. desperation of AIDS/HIV patients pitted against the inadequacy of the FDA and the medical profession to provide treatment) .  Instead this film distorts the truth and goes for shock value .  Ron Woodroof and his actions are barely recognizable in McConaughey's re-shaping of the facts.  Neither the real nor reel life Ron Woodroof was anything but a self-serving lowlife, who switched from selling recreational drugs to alternative ""medicines"" for the dying.  Did he actually help or poison these gullible customers.  The film does not address this.  Did he actually extend his own life or was his diagnosis misrepresented? Furthermore, the film presents Woodroof as a tall, swaggering, bull-riding, skirt-chasing bachelor while Woodroof was actually  married, a father, kinda short and mousy looking and reportedly homosexual himself. The homophobic reaction to AIDS at its onset (i.e. opinions they brought this on themselves with deviate behavior) , the terror , loss, and tragedy in the gay community, and the of the slow response of the medical community to find treatment and cures for the afflicted is a compelling story.  I do not think that story was well-served by this film.",1398902400,20,3624,5.091216216216216

6116394,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I felt that the acting was great, the message was powerful, and it was very entertaining.  I couldn't imagine being in Matthew McConaughey's shoes basically fighting a losing battle against the FDA.  It just seems so unfair that an organization can tell someone on the brink of death that they can't use a certain type of treatment that may potentially buy them time because it is not approved by the FDA.  I understand why there are the restrictions there are (i.e., the potential deadly and severe side-effects for various medications and legal implications), but when it comes to life or death, I think you should be allowed to give anything a shot.  What's the worst that could come of it?  There's a chance you will die.  I'm pretty sure most people would take that chance compared to a 0% chance of living without at least giving it a shot.  If you enjoy movies with good messages or intense dramas you'll definitely enjoy this one.

I remember the line from the Broadway play ""Rent,"" when Mark tells Roger, ""Take your AZT,"" with genuine love and concern.  AZT was the ""it"" drug, the only game in town.

FDA had hurriedly decided to put something out on the market.  Now AZT is among many drugs for AIDs, including  interferon and protease inhibitors,

Terrific movie, although I'm sure they've taken some liberties and made the guys with AIDS  look heroic.

6116422,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Ron Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey, is living it up in 1986, doing drugs and alcohol, betting on the rodeo, and banging multiple girls simultaneously when he is unexpectedly diagnosed with AIDS. Even from the first scenes of the movie, he is obviously emaciated and very ill, and yet the diagnosis for a heterosexual man was shocking and unexpected since AIDS was considered a disease of homosexuals. He is instantly shunned by his buddies who accusing him of being a ""homo"". The doctor gives him 6 months to live and starts him on a course of AZT, the only drug regimen available at the time to treat the disease. The afflicted who are enrolled in the blind trials are all made even sicker by the treatment, yet they line up to get a chance to get the drugs.

Out of desperation, Ron heads to a clinic in Mexico run by a doctor willing to experiment with alternative therapies, none of which are sanctioned by the FDA. He starts feeling better and smuggles some of the drugs back into the U.S., and decides to start peddling them to others afflicted by the disease. He even travels to Japan to try and make a deal for some of the drugs. He enlists cross-gender dressing gay Rayon, played by Jared Leto, to help him in the business, Dallas Buyer's Club, which he runs out of his apartment.

Woodroof's motivations are complex. No doubt he enjoyed the income from the brisk business he did in peddling the drugs, for which he charged a monthly fee for admission to the Dallas Buyers Club. He turned away those that couldn't afford it, even when they begged him pitifully. But he also put himself at great risk by providing a service for those desperately searching for a treatment and a cure. He could have just obtained the drugs for himself and a few others, but he chose to broaden his influence. Nevertheless, he isn't an entirely commendable person, as he continued using recreational drugs and having unprotected sex while ill.

It's hard to imagine another actor who could have played this role with the bravado and swagger and vulnerability of McConaughey, though the scenes when you see his shriveled, emaciated body are hard to endure. I can't help wondering whether the actor has done any permanent damage to his body by losing 40 pounds off of an already slender frame. Nevertheless, this portrayal will define his body of work for years to come and put him in the running for other serious and substantial roles.",1398556800,,2433,4.679906542056075

McConaughey, although amazing in his role, lost TOO much weight for the part, and looked positively gruesome (yes, I realize this is what the movie was about, but it was disturbing all the same).

6116450,3,B00GUO3C3W,"The movie drags out too long but makes up for the almost pointless first half at the end. After the the first 20 minutes or so I was expecting to see subtitles because it reminded me of the foreign films my friends dragged me to watch in college that appeared to really be going nowhere and nowhere slowly only to be told that I simply was unable to understand the subtle sophistication of what I will refer to as cinematic purgatory.

In any case, the underlying theme throughout much of the movie even when the plot starts to kick in is that Matthew McConaughey is very skinny. However, from how the movie presents it, he was always skinny so if the dramatic effect of him losing weight was to illustrate the tragedy of getting the disease the point is lost. My suggestion is simple, show him skinnier towards the middle and end.

The movie in a nutshell is simple... Rough and tough, wheeling dealing, rodeo cowboy who likes to party with hard drugs, alcohol and hookers passes out one day, wakes up in the hospital and finds out he has HIV. He's told he has 30 days to live and he denies he has the disease because he is not gay. His friends and associates quickly start to ostracize him because they assume he has contracted a gay disease and they, ""being from Texas"" hate gays very much.

After some internal reflection he accepts he has AIDS/HIV and after reading up on the subject becomes an expert on the disease after a few trips to the library and sets out to regain his quality of life (aka drugs, hookers, booze)... He reluctantly partners up with a support AIDS group who he hates initially because the are gay and he's a cowboy from Texas, who must automatically hate gays and starts to experiment with non FDA approved methods of treatment from other countries through the help of a doctor who lost his license and fled to Mexico.

After some success with his experiment, he doubles down on partnering with the gays in drag from the support group and starts a ""drug"" trafficking operation in a hotel where he is able to subvert criminal charges at first because he is not selling anything illegal but rather offering a membership to a club for a fee with unlimited access to non-illegal drugs who simply aren't FDA approved by mirroring similar operations in NY and San Francisco, whom he also hates because they are gay and he's from Texas. Towards the end at the advice of the license-less doctor he stops the drugs, booze, and orgies and focuses on fighting the system.  He survives several years, eventually dies but does beat out the 30 day death clock so he beat the system and won.

Morals of the story -
The FDA to some extent but especially Doctors and Big Pharma are pure evil
People from Texas hate gays
Matthew lost a lot of weight adding nothing to the storyline whatsoever
Rough and tough rodeo types are big time into hookers, hard drugs and alcohol
It's okay to hate gays, as long as you make friends eventually with a few in drag before you die

It also conveys an important message to the community at large while not leaving out the compelling challenges/experiences, and role of each individual character/person involved. Matthew McConahagy's and Jared Leto's work is some of the finest ever recorded on film, in my opinion. True to the original nature and purpose of ""acting"", they allowed themselves as persons living now/ their egos, to move into abeyance sufficiently so that the lives and stories of those two suffering yet amazingly resilient souls could come through them and tell their stories to we, the observers and, in some ways, participants in 2014.

McConaughey, however, has deserved all the accolades thrown on for this performance. It was one of the best I've seen in any film the past 5 years.

There is also the Greek tragedy underpinnings whereby the players grow and learn about themselves and others.  McConaughey learns the most, finding himself in a situation he cannot accept, fighting the whole time, trying to come to terms with the impossible.

The supporting cast also excellent, giving us a insight to the big pharmas and their tactics and those in the medical profession who fight them and those who play their game to the detriment of the public at large, or to the near genocide of the third world.",1397865600,,958,4.804878048780488

Matthew McConanaughy plays an AIDS victim, straight, who becomes an advocate for such victims, mostly homosexuals in the US, while not hesitating to profit off them.  He looks the part.  He IS the part, in this Oscar-winning performance.  If you're into social activism and you enjoy exposing and decrying how the government fails some segments of the population, you'll like this movie.  If you're not, or if you're into religion and you see AIDS as one of God's ways of smiting down sinners, you will find it long and boring and tedious.",1397779200,,699,4.931623931623932

The star is able to convey the completely frustrated situation of being stricken with a disease no one knows how to treat, the fear and lonliness of being abandoned by your closest friends, as well as the overwhellming desire to live despite it all.  He is able to take his pain and turn it into his own attempt at a cure not only for himself but others suffering from the disease.  Especially interesting is his homophobic lifestyle that is so changed when he is constantly accused of being gay since initially it was considered to be a gay disease.  His best friend becomes a beautiful gay man who is suffering the disease but living every moment  to the best of his ability and shows him another side of being a strong gay man.  I loved every moment of it  which displays such a sad but true story, that leaves you truly thinking about what this man went through,  Excellent, touching and thought provoking.",1397692800,,1009,4.566666666666666

I think it is best described as ""raw"". No doubt McConaughey and Leto deserve the Oscars. They were worth watching but both lost a lot of weight for the roles and truly looked emaciated.  I read that one of them had vision problems as his weight reduction was so extreme.  As Laurence Olivier apparently said to Dustin Hoffman (who had stayed up through a couple of nights to make him look haggard for a scene in  ""Marathon Man""): ""Why don't you try acting?""

6116556,2,B00GUO3C3W,"Excellent acting, intense telling of a story that is only partially true.  In the movie, Ron Woodroof's bias against gays (in the movie straight himself), is not true according to his friends and family.  Those close to him in real life say that he was very comfortable in their circle and everyone knew him to be gay (perhaps bisexual).  I'm focusing on this, because the anti-gay theme in the movie by the main character himself is pretty core to the movie.
Also good to know is that language (how many f's and m-f's can you stand?), sex, drug use and just generally how people treat each other is definitely R rated.  (The opening scene with Ron Woodroof having sex behind the gates of a rodeo is quite shocking.)
It was very difficult to understand some of the lines (slurred, choppily edited) - it needed subtitles for sure.
I can see how both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto (incredible performance!) received Oscars for their roles, but for me, personally, I did not enjoy the movie.",1397433600,2,993,4.689655172413793

What the movie does is display the ridiculous of the government being so deeply into healthcare as to be counter-productive, and how more natural means allows the body to heal itself. It's how the human body was designed! We have forgotten how powerful we are.

The hardest thing to watch was Matthew McConaughey being so gaunt. Gracious... it really changes your looks!  I do hope there is no lasting or long-term effects from basically starving yourself for a role.  I'm sure his wife is happy to have him getting back to his normal!",1397433600,,696,4.492063492063492

Why on Earth he lost so much weight for such a stupid movie role is beyond me. I didn't particularly care about the AIDS patients in the movie, I didn't care about the hideous looking drag queen dying of AIDS, and I didn't particularly care about Hollywood's message in this movie about some cowboy with AIDS turning into a gay lover.

6116568,5,B00GUO3C3W,"The subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, but this is a wonderful movie. Ron Woodruff, a not so nice guy and a rough and tumble rodeo hanger-on and electrician finds out he has HIV and later on AIDS. These were the days when an AIDS diagnosis meant death. He gets really ill, and his appearance shows his health rapidly declining. He embarks on finding and obtaining better treatment than he's able to get the strictly legal way here in the States. He comes up with a clever plan. His health gets better. He looks better. Along the way he meets some interesting characters. Matthew McConaughey won the Oscar for a reason. This is a stellar performance the likes of which aren't seen often. He becomes Woodruff in mind, body, and spirit. There are several scenes that will tear your heart out. The other performances in this movie are likewise stellar. The movie is a serious one, depressing at times, and sad. But there are funny moments, and McConaughey doesn't dwell on the ""down"" aspects of his situation.

It's based on a true story about a guy (Ron Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey) who at first is a nasty, macho Texas homophobe and who gradually changes into a tolerant, kindly, generous person after he learns he is HIV-positive. (Character-change plot.)

VERY well scripted with realistic dialogue and very few plot holes (see more in the Comments section below) ... and well cast and well acted.

Deeply touching!! And occasionally very funny.

And you may find that the tight real-life financial links between some hospitals/doctors and Big Pharma and the FDA are very disturbing.

WARNING: Contains tons of obscenity and some nudity and simulated sex ... so if you watch it, most of you probably won't want your parents or your kids joining you.",1397174400,,789,5.030769230769231

For anyone who has lived through the AIDS years as an activist, it brought back some very vivid memories.  Many were quite painful. I would not recommend that the viewer takes on this film if he/she are at all depressed.  It is a very ""real"" depiction of the situation at the time of the initial years of the disease.
For anyone that didn't live through those years first hand, I would recommend the film that so well conveys some of what went on during that time.
It is a tough film to watch, but well worth the experience.
The actors are all first rate.  The story action doesn't miss a beat. The film  has you spellbound, beginning to end.

I didn't want to even blink, fearing I would miss something.  Matthew has a way of sucking me in, hypnotizing me.  From this role to his performance on True Detective, he's a stunner.  And not just physically.  There was nothing of that in DBC or True Detective.  I think when he gets away from the charming, pretty boy roles, he just shines.

6116609,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey is unrecognizable as real-life AIDS victim Ron Woodroof. His face is gaunt with sunken eye sockets and his skin is stretched tight over a skeletal frame. Ron's Texan swagger and blunt outlook eclipses McConaughey's laid-back, cool personality.  Jared Leto plays his drugged-out Queen sidekick, Rayon. Both men are HIV patients under the supervision of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), during the birth of the disease when FDA approved meds were non-existant.

Ron is a natural homophobe. Before testing positive for HIV, he chases every vice there is: coke, whiskey, strippers, and gambling. Ron is a stereotypical Texan at heart, and works as an electrician and rodeo cowboy during his off-hours. When Ron is electrocuted on the job and lands in the hospital, he learns that he is HIV positive. This burns all ties with his friends and neighbors, who write him off as a ""queer.""

During a random check-up with Dr. Saks, Ron meets his future business partner and best pal Rayon, an HIV-positive tranny. They don't quite ""kick it off."" Ron is hostile around his new flamer acquaintance, who he calls ""tinkerbell."" Rayon, already used to this type of derogatory slang, shrugs it off. They soon build a working relationship and join forces to distribute unapproved HIV/AIDS drugs to the local gay community in the Dallas area. This is the start of Ron's new venture, the Dallas Buyers Club, through which local HIV/AIDS patients receive unapproved treatment on the cheap. Ron charges $400 for a monthly membership; this includes meds, vitamins, and patient advice.

Ron sets up shop in Rayon's apartment, and soon has customers snaking out of their second-story door, all the way to the parking lot downstairs. People are desperate for treatment. A blaring TV shouts that the government is issuing FDA-approved AZT for upwards of $10K per month. This is an insane mark-up from Ron's paltry $400. Everyone, doctor included, sees the good in Ron's hustle. The FDA catches wind and cracks down hard. All of Ron's drugs are seized and his operation is shut down.

The best part of The Dallas Buyers Club is Matthew McConaughey's performance. He is charismatic, unflinching, and dead set on helping his fellow HIV/AIDS victims to treatment beyond government regulation. Small touches like Ron leaning in during a conversation with Dr. Saks over a candle light dinner reveal the character's earnest intentions. Other scenes, like Ron swinging around his IV bag in a rage after being dragged off by security for cussing out an FDA spokesmen at an AIDS support group remain long after the end credits roll. Ripping Rayon's pictures of Boy George off the wall of his office makes for some funny moments.

The real Ron Woodroof passed away in 1992, after battling the virus for 7 years. This is 6 years and 11 months more than the 30 days his diagnosing physician told him he would live. Watching this story unfold on film makes for one of the best, original, and moving dramas to hit theaters in a long time. Dallas Buyers Club has since won awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor at the 2014 Academy Awards. This is a must see.",1396915200,2,3144,4.933837429111531

The transformation of McConaughey's character from a homophobe to someone who looks at people without labels is powerful and very believable. (His character never embraces the lifestyle, yet he accepts people of a different orientation and defends them voraciously among those who do not.) Jared Leto's performance is also mesmerizing; to anyone who has not seen him in another role or even view his acceptance speech at the ceremony in February, there will no doubt be many opportunities to see him perform, for his future is as bright as his DBC's character was not.

Their battle against the FDA opened up new drug trials for other diseases and modeled how to fight the FDA and win.

It is worth viewing for that alone.
However, the story is just not well edited, and individual scenes aren't very memorable EXCEPT for the acting.
It seems like the camera use and/or movement was not lending itself to helping build any solid artistic cohesiveness.
OK story, and could have been great with better editing.
Still glad I watched it.",1396742400,,398,4.955223880597015

6116650,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I had heard about this movie before, but when I saw the clips of it at the Oscars and how Matthew McConaughey won best actor, I had to see this. After viewing it, I can totally understand why he won the most prestigious award for acting. What makes this movie so much more ground breaking and shocking is that it is based on true events and the real Ron Woodard, who took his life in his own hands, said doctors don't know everything, and self medicated.... proving that sometimes, even doctors aren't always right. They said he had 30 days to live and Ron lived 7 years after being diagnosed with HIV.

What was really heartbreaking is his initial diagnosis. He goes through denial. Of course, back in 1985 they didn't know much about the virus. The assumption was that only intravenous drug users and homosexuals were the at risk population. When Ron is doing his own research, he stumbles across a sentence that mentions those who have unprotected sex are at risk as well. That's when it hits him - the doctors didn't mix up his blood with someone else's (as he first claims).... he remembers all of the risky sex he's had and he knows that he truly does have the HIV virus.

Jared Leto plays a cross dresser, and he won best supporting actor at the Oscars, a well deserved win for him as well. At first, McConaughey's character is homophobic, but once him and Leto team up to start the buyers club, he realizes that gay people are humans too.

I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen the movie yet. The emotion is raw, the acting is incredible, and the story as a whole will really make you think about our war on HIV and AIDS. For a man to have the courage to step up and realize that the subjects of an AZT test trial are just getting sicker, and for him to go out and take matters into his own hands is really inspiring. It also goes to show that for the most part, the FDA might be a good idea, but it still is a flawed system  in some aspects.

If you're up for an emotional, true story with great acting and a wonderful script, get this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1396742400,,2105,4.305555555555555

This not only goes for Aids, but every other diseases as well. There is treatment today for cancer that does not include Chemotherapy.  But the AMA, and the FDA will not allow it to be even tested here because of the money that will be lost by the doctors and drug companies. There are over 50 diseases that are being cured in Europe and other countries via Adult Stem research that is not allowed in the US.  What McConaughey portrayed here is only the tip of the iceberg.

2013 was a year in film where the exceptional talent in acting and directing, screen writing, cinematography, etc., was well distributed. There was competitive parity.

The Dallas Buyer's Club (DBC) had the Academy's best actor, Matthew McConaughey and best supporting actor Jared Leto, in a year of exceptional films. Add the performances of Griffen Dunn and Jennifer Gardner, a story whose time has come and you have enough to win best movie. It didn't win the Academy's award for best movie, of course. It didn't win my award for best movie either. But it gets 5 stars from me for marvelous storytelling and knock out performances.

I think that the way the movie was made so dark and dragged the movie audience down.  A lot of what the movie was trying to sell was hope and it failed to make me want any of the people in the movie to be happy or to care for them.  The actors were robotic and really tried hard to make us think this was society that caused this.  I felt very empty after watching and not moved by the cause they tried to make us join.,1396656000,,574,3.71900826446281

Living in the 80's I was able to relate to everything I saw and heard in this film. The directors really got the fear and hate that was felt during that time as well as the bonds that came to fruitation amongst the people trying to survive a disease that the FDA was holding back on.

6116668,5,B00GUO3C3W,"McConaughey is not an actor I find appealing nor do I like this cowboy character but I was mesmerized by the journey he makes in this film and am completely blown away by the pitch perfect performance of Jared Leto's tragic and compelling Rayon. I watched the movie a second time without hesitation. It is a stunning film. Almost against my will, I find myself sticking with this unlovable man, following him until he redeems himself with me. He makes me care about him as he fights for his life and demonstrates what he learns of love. I am left with a grudging admiration for his courage and pure cussed tenacity and something like awe for his toughness and determination to act and effect change despite all odds. There are breathtaking scenes. In one, a despondent hero is seen in closeup, seemingly by candlelight with head bowed possibly praying, then the camera pulls back to reveal the the legs of the dancer on the bar where he sits drinking at his altar. There is a scene with a hug that is so redemptive. A scene where a man humbles himself and goes home. The visual impact is heightened by the extremely emaciated frame these two actors achieved for these roles; their method acting immersion in the characters who are fighting a deadly disease is equally bone deep. This is what it was like when the world started fighting back and people started living instead of always dying with this disease. This is when the tide began to turn. It is also a film that indicts all that is homophobic in our society equally with the profit driven pharmaceutical industry and regulatory climate that can so easily marginalize and foster lack of compassion for the sick and dying.",1396656000,,1678,4.653198653198653

The relationship between him and the transvestite Jared Leto plays was wonderfully portrayed, they both deserved their Oscars. This film made me laugh, cry and think: one cannot ask more than that.

You will have to wade through some uncomfortable sex scenes, bad language, homophobic remarks and rampant use of drugs.
Hang in there, the story as it evolves will draw you in, the characters are strong and the story is so well done.
This is a dark movie, it tells the story if failure of the government and in some cases medicine not meeting the needs of the HIV/Aids patients in the infancy of the disease and the inability to get medication which might prolong life.
Vey well done, I would recommend it but only when the kids are gone.

He looked the part so much that is was almost painful to watch. At the time that Ron was diagnosed, they did not have hope for people or treatment. I remember going to see one of my friends back in 1985 at this hospital ( the movie did not use the hospitals real name so neither will I) and he was 6'1"" and weighed about 95 pounds. If you looked in the rooms down the long hallway, this is all you would see. They would let people choose to discontinue treatment and die due to they needed the beds and there was nothing they could do. The best they could do was make people as comfortable as possible and let them go. It was a very bad time in America. I did not know Ron but I wish I had. It looked like he helped a lot of people. The movie for me was personal. I loved it but I could see some people not liking it due to the subject matter. My husband would not watch this but he does not like shall we say "" the ugly side of life"" that can affect any of us at any time wether it be AIDS, Cancer or so many other disease. I think everyone should see this film even though it is painful to watch at times. AIDS as we now know can affect anyone. BRAVO on a great performance and a real look at what people went through in the 80's. Not only did they suffer physically but they were also treated horribly by the general public due to fear and ignorance. God bless all my friends and all of the people that have been affected by this disease. God bless Ron Woodroof for not just laying down and accepting what the doctors said. This is also an eye opening experience in how the FDA has to much control in what people should have a right too. They are there to protects us but let's face it, when money is involved, the best interest of the people gets over looked. Look at all the commercials today with lawsuits against medication, that were FDA approved, due to the damage they have caused. Maybe this film will shake things up a little and get the FDA to look a little deeper into what their role should really be and not their  bottom line.",1396310400,,2174,4.103286384976526

To keep going after that is just over the top dedication.  He looked horrible, which was exactly the point.  But, his performance was incredible.  This is a must-see movie for everyone.

6116734,4,B00GUO3C3W,"McConaughey's performance is transformative - long gone are the days of ""aright, aright, aright..."" and ""Be cooler if you did!""

I rated this movie lower than I might have because, while the story is powerful and plays on themes that I find compelling (Libertarianism, free markets, personal responsibility) it also is a continuation of what John Podhoretz called the ""White Trashing of TV"" (read the fantastic article here: [...])  where coastal elites attempt to humanize the great, unwashed mass of rednecks and intolerant homophobes who live in flyover country.  The casual bigotry on display between McConaughey's character and his friends is practically a minstrel show.

Aside from that annoying and grating pontification, the real enemy in this movie is cast as the FDA - who work in league with large pharmaceutical companies to suppress non-approved treatments for serious illnesses.  The movie does run the risk however of going too far in that direction, because the FDA does serve the useful purpose of preventing any quack from setting up shop and selling miracle cures to desperate and sick people, even if at the margin they may prevent some people from gaining access to what might otherwise be life-saving or life-extending medicines.",1396310400,,1252,5.24

Otherwise and inspiring story about a person who didn't take no for an answer and ignored officialdom to help himself and other people in that situation.  The officials were worried about getting a useful result in drug trials, which depended on strict adherence and placebos.  The trouble is that it takes a long time and the drug might not be good or too toxic.  The patients see that and don't want to be sacrificial lambs, are looking for a faster turnaround.  We still have situations like this where the authorities are looking (or not looking) for treatments for CFS, autism, lyme disease, Gulf War illness, etc, etc.  And sometimes their focus is more on what helps officials and researchers and ignores the patients input. If anyone doesn't want to follow orders that the officials give, even if it helps patients, they get in trouble.

Has sex with another chick after he finds out she's got AIDS so he can't do no harm. Drug references, a lot more in the beginning of the movie. It's about AIDS victims so there's going to be a homosexuals, some of the flaming. If that sort of thing bothers you, you'll be bothered. But it's a true story about how big pharma basically kept other AIDS treatments options except AZT out of the US and how Matt's character got around that limited and made some money. But more importantly, how he helped a lot of sick people live better lives.

It also shows the reason why many people believed, and sadly, a lot of the still do, that AIDS is ""gay disease."" Combined with homophobia, AIDS epidemic crisis, ignorance and corruption, this movie touches on many subjects, yet remains focused and absolutely not boring. It's almost an educational videos for people who still don't understand the difference between HIV and AIDS. With all this being said: I highly recommend this movie.

6116818,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The film,Dallas Buyers Clubwalked away with 3 Academy Awards. Best Make-up, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. The 116 minute movie is Rated R. There are some highly sexual and sensual scenes, nudity, and bad language, as well as adult themes. It is based on a true story. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, this Indie was made with a modest shoestring budget of just$5 million dollars.

Ron Woodroof (portrayed by Matthew McConaughey), is a rodeo junkie and electrician by trade. It is 1985, and he is mans man. The movie opens with him having sex while watching a man thrown from a bull. A heavy drinker and drug user,and while fighting a persistent cough, Woodroof winds up in the hospital where he is diagnosed with AIDS, and given just 30 days to live.

Woodroof goes through denial. Rock Hudson recently died of AIDS. The disease at the time was associated with homosexuals. Realizing that unprotected sex with women, intraveneous drug using prostitutes and the like, Woodroof has no doubt how hed contracted the disease. What he isn't ready for is the mistreatment and bullying by friends. (If I did not know McConaughey was in the film, I never would have recognized him. Losing close to fifty pounds, he is a skeleton of a man; sporting skin wrapped around bones muscle and meat completely absent).

Determined to fight the disease, Woodroof researches the illness, and medical treatments available, both conventional and unconventional. While being trated by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), he learns thatZidovudine (AZT) is in the testing stages. Groups are being selected, some receiving the drug, some a placebo (sugar pill). Here, Woodroof meets Rayon (Jared Leto), a transexual and serious drug abuser. Rayon has HIV, and is in the AZT trials.

Becoming highly informed, Woodroof begins treatment in Mexico. The drugs used are not illegal, or dangerous, butare notF.D.A. approved, and therefore create a border-crossing, distribution issue. Teaming up with Rayon, the two couple their talents; Rayon with his connections to the gay community (where, regardless of sterotypes,AIDSisprevelant), and Woodroof, as the supplier of AIDS treatment medication, starts a club where the meds are free, but the membership is $400 a month.

Trouble with the government, local police, andstaff at the hospital, Woodroof and Rayon fight a constant legal battle for the rightto save themselves and others who are infected and have been classified as terminally ill, while engaged in wars agianst their own demons.

Performances by McConaughey and Leto were amazing. There is no doubt why the two won Academys. No doubt. While it is not one of my favorite movies of, it was a very good movie. I did not play with my phone, post on Facebook or Tweet. This says a lot. True stories always amaze me. There is plenty of history behind the real people, and the steps taken tofinally get this film made. Not sinceA Time to Killhas McConaughey impressed me asmuch. Out of 10 stars, I giveDallas Buyers Cluban 8.

It's unclear to me whether the cocktail of drugs Ron Woodruff was relying on represented any sort of treatment breakthrough, though it is implied that his customers enjoyed an improved quality of life and extended survival. It certainly brings to life the period in history when the FDA wasn't moving nearly fast enough to deal with the AIDS crisis and underscores problems with the US medical system.

The performances of McConaughey and Leto are no doubt powerful, though I thought the integration between the white trash whoring cokehead scumbag alcoholic homophobe idiot Woodruff and the complex medical journal-interpreting international businessman Woodruff wasn't quite buyable as played.",1395792000,,763,5.692982456140351

The picture itself is very entertaining but has scenes that are disturbing and seedy.  So, if you are easily offended by graphic sex or drug use, then you probably want to stay away.  Otherwise, it's an incredible story of a man who is fighting to survive during a very confusing time in the war on HIV/AIDS.  Also, I hope I say this in a politically correct fashion, but I never got the feeling that this movie was trying to make a point, but simply telling the story of one man's experience, and allowing the viewer to make up his/her own mind.

Knowing that the major character would die by the end of the movie was depressing but as the story unfolded you began to root for this man and what he accomplished in the last years of his life. He tackled major agencies head on and won with intelligence and ingenuity that I found profound given his circumstances at the beginning of the story. A scraggly man in appearance living in an equally scraggly trailer with a life going nowhere but when his back is against the wall he taps into his intelligence and climbs mountains for not only his good but for others.

6116897,1,B00GUO3C3W,What happened to Hollywood? I figured since this movie won acting academy awards that it should be a good story. Not the case! The story line was flat. It does not delve deeply into any issues which the story is based upon. There is no sense of drama or suspense. Once you find out the lead character's mission (which is very early in the film) the story stops moving forward other than the character's change of attitude toward other's who are different than him.

6116904,4,B00GUO3C3W,"A scathing retroactive commentary on the sins of the FDA and the failures of the US government as the AIDS epidemic was kicking into high gear. Matthew McConaughey (the latest actor to reap rewards for grotesquely altering his appearance) is barely recognizable in the leading role, a rail-thin, homophobic cowboy who contracts the disease at a point in time where it was widely believed that gays were its only victims. The dose of reality he's fed is swift, bitter and thoroughly justified, though that doesn't make it any easier to watch. His journey is an impressive one, if bittersweet, and his emergence from drunkenness and ignorance is a key point. Heartbreakingly vivid, especially in its portrayal of the contradictory lengths the government is willing to go to preserve the interests of its real masters, it deserves credit for refusing to hammer the point until we're all feeling blunt and dulled. I appreciated the ride and agreed with each core message, though naysayers could certainly accuse it of having an agenda.",1395619200,,1031,5.070588235294117

6116907,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Dallas Buyers Club is an amazing story enhanced by even better acting.  It contains a number of stock actions which can often derail a movie and it is only because of the great acting here that we feel great sympathy and get involved closely in the story.  Matthew McConaughey and Jared Laeto take stock roles and make them real.  McConaughy takes a bigot/redneck and turns him into someone who at first is an opportunist but then a legitimate crusader.  Leto plays his role as a genuinely sympathetic, if self destructive personality.

I did not expect this film to be as moving, heartwarming even, as it turned out to be.
It was a tour de force of Life's longing for Life; & I cannot find words enough to praise it; so that I must leave it to Alfred Lord Tennyson to say the words for me:
""Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,

It started off rough, rowdy and I almost turned it off as it was a bit too sexy for my taste.  I remembered this period of time and the Rock Hudson story breaking.  I had no idea a decade later I would operate a shelter and get a call requesting placement for a woman and her 5 month old baby needing a place immediately and her husband who had just been diagnosed with Aids and was still in the hospital.  I pondered the safety issues for other residents and what this could mean to our donors and then I said okay.  This movie took me through every emotion of the time and reminded me how far we have come.  Amazingly, though her husband passed within two years, neither she nor her baby ever tested positive.

I can see why Matthew M won for best actor. His performance is flawless and his portrayal of Ron Woodroof is striking. The story revolves around Ron's diagnosis of AIDS and how he was only given days to live. He ends up in Mexico looking for a cure and stumbles on a doctor who not only teaches him what combination of drugs to take and why but sets him up sends him back to the US where Ron sets up the Buyers Club, where the drugs are free and all you have to pay is a membership fee. What a brilliant idea! This is one of those movies I will watch again and again, much like Philadelphia or To Kill a Mockingbird.",1395360000,,798,4.121794871794871
6116939,4,B00GUO3C3W,The movie was great.  The true story is sad and what he did was amazing by looking up and using different methods from all over the world to stay alive with aids.

Despite the fact that the 'F' word is liberally sprinkled through out this movie, Matt Mc stretches himself and shows us the depths of his talent when he applies himself.

One of the ways I judge movies is by their re-watch factor and to me the re-watch factor of this movie was pretty low. I recognize that it was a good movie, but I personally didn't love it and frankly I will probably have no reason to watch it again.",1395360000,,482,4.426966292134831
6116944,3,B00GUO3C3W,"The story is about a man's fight with the FDA who is trying to enforce food and health laws. The man has AIDS and is trying to stay alive, and keep other AIDS victims alive, using medications and drugs not approved by the FDA. In that respect it's a good story. The FDA is fighting quackery, the story's hero claims it's the quacks and unapproved drugs that really have the answers he's looking  for. The main character of the story is not the type of person I'd care to be friends with, nor is his life-style attractive to me. It's too bad he acquired AIDS, but his risky life-style led to his downfall, and I didn't enjoy seeing his whoring and drug use up close and personal. There would have been more sympathy for the character's problem if its cause hadn't been thrown into the viewer's face. But then, maybe the producers of the movie were more interested in selling tickets to people that wanted to see an R rated movie than wanted to think about the problems of people who need unapproved medical techniques and/or medication.",1395360000,,1035,4.53475935828877

6116954,5,B00GUO3C3W,"McConaughey deserves standing accolades for his abilities as an actor to accurately depict the full range of homophobic reactions to this disease. The success in defiance of authority started as a money-maker for him while searching his own cure and ended in love and acceptance of those he once despised for their differences.

If a pharmaceutical treatment is a money maker for pharmaceuticals it will be approved by the FDA. Any alternative treatment to ease pain or actually cure will be a political fight for approval for use because...(see above). The physician's bible of pharmaceuticals is the P.D.R. written by - you guessed it - pharmaceutical companies.

There will never be a cure for any disease that continues to make money and everyone in America has the freedom to agree (or not) with the views of Atanus. *sigh*",1395360000,,828,4.992753623188406

The backstage in the pharmaceutical world came as a bonus since it shows viewers that there is a lot more in between the diseased and medication than meets the eyes. However, what is hard to believe is how a lifelong poor Texan cowboy can overnight become a businessman traveling all over the world, even if it is for the sale and buy of illegal medicine.

Back in 1978 where I worked, during lunch, several ""gay"" men would talk about their young friends who had developed a mysterious brain cancer, or liver disease.  Later as a young, phlebotomist I worked in the AIDS wards and yes, most of the men with AIDS looked like a thousand mosquitoes had bitten them.  Those were scary times, and my supervisor made everyone put on masks, gloves AND paper gowns before going into their rooms.  The transmission of AIDS was unknown in those days.

6116965,5,B00GUO3C3W,"One of the best films I've seen this year! A raw, gritty, and incredible true story about a HIV diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the AIDS epidemic was at it's worst.

Matthew McConaughey who lost a significant amount of weight to play the role gives the performance of his career along with Jared Leto who's equally as good here. The two give quite possibly the best performances I've seen in a film all year in which I actually forgot I was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if I was watching real people. There's no doubt they will both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

While this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall, it's excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it. While it's defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch, it's a truly inspiring (and important) true story and one of the years best films.

McConaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films. His recent performances however, have shown that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now. Dallas Buyers Club is only further proof of this.",1395273600,,1257,4.504385964912281

Matthew is striking and riveting as Ron Woodruff, hustler/hedonist who fights the medical establishment when he contacts AIDS but manages to survive the dire 1 month diagnosis by smuggling drugs that are not FDA approved.  How his character changes from homophobic to activist with the help of Raynor, a transsexual played by Oscar winner Jared Leto will pull you in with an inspiring story that's hard to beat.",1395187200,,933,4.967948717948718

The number of those with hiv/ aids, and other related diseases as well as cancer and hep need cures and I am sure there are brilliant men out there like the doctor in mexico who know secrets to helping. I hate how the world is set up for the rich and big business. Matthew mc always seems to play the fast and loose hustler/ hotshot but I am glad to see him in a role with some diversity.

The homophobia, blatant manipulation by the pharmaceutical industry, and sexual conduct made it uncomfortable to watch, but offer a fantastic perspective into a dark time in our nation's industry. It demonstrates how greed and ignorance can paralyze a society into inaction.
I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for McConaughey and Leto to perform in their roles, and applaud their willingness to participate this way. It speaks to their moral courage to step outside of societal ""norms"" to show how real people struggled.

I really wish we could right some of these wrongs that hold back hope. But, while we stand and applaud this mans conviction to do what is right by sneaking medications into the country that might help others live longer.

Unbelieveable how the two of them transformed themselves. It's an incredible story of how one person fought the system and made it change. I was part of that scene in the 80s.... as a pharmacist... and clearly remember the struggle around AZT but was not aware who was behind it. Leto's performance was astounding!

6117042,4,B00GUO3C3W,"I didn't go into this movie expecting anything in particular. I just wanted to have a neutral attitude and let the movie speak for itself. It did not disappoint. Matthew M. just gets better and better as he gets older; and I don't mean his looks, I mean his acting ability. Check out his HBO mini-series, ""True Detective"" and you'll see what I mean. Both he and Jared Leto lost a lot of weight for these roles and they both looked rather sickly, as one might expect from someone HIV/Aids. I read a little bit about the real Ron and it seemed he was even more foul than the character portrayed in this film. I am guessing they decided to tone it down a bit so as to make the audience more sympathetic to the character. And Matthew brought it. You definitely feel for his character throughout this film. Jared Leto perhaps stole every scene he was in. His character, Rayon, was a trip and a half. The scene that nearly gutted me was when he went to his father dressed like a man. I won't spoil this any further. But watch for that scene and see if you had the same reaction. I had no idea who Jared Leto was before this film. He is a very talented man. And, might I add, a very pretty man; which is why he made such a great transsexual woman. As a side note, I'm sure that Matthew appreciated not having to disguise his accent for this movie, being a native Texan himself. And let's not forget Jennifer Garner. She gave one of the best performances of her career in this movie. You start out not feeling sure who her character is, or how she fits in, or how she will evolve. But she does fit in and evolve. The movie was gritty and sympathetic all at the same time. You actually cared about what happened to these people.

6117075,3,B00GUO3C3W,"First of all, the acting in this film is incredible.  Even the minor characters are portrayed well.  You will love the good guys, no matter all their flaws.  You will hate the ignorant, greedy, and foolish ""bad guys"" who meddle in innocent peoples' lives.  Leto and McConaughey BECOME different people for this film.  Just amazing to watch.

The main issue with this film is that it is a depressing, slowly paced, struggle against enemies who always win because they have the government in their pockets.  It's the feel bad movie of the year.

That said, it is very important that we highlight the struggles of the little guy versus the evils of Big Pharma and Big Government.  Movies like this demonstrate and reveal how cruel and greedy and outlandishly stupid the government is.

This man's struggle is worth knowing about, but it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.  That taste is the need to fix our horrible, intrusive, and incompetent healthcare system and the corruptible government that regulates everything.

Definitely worth seeing.  Never worth buying.  It's inspirational and informative.  It's also very sad.",1395100800,,1133,4.983957219251337

The  developing relationship between the smart, sassy, charming drag queen and the homophobic cowboy provided a story arc which helped moved the plot from one chronological place to another. It was nice to see that Ron and Rayon were able to become good friends and business partners in spite of their differences. Ron defending Rayon's honor from the jibes of his homophobic and AIDS phobic ex buddy was poignant and moral. On the other hand the movie glossed over the messiness and ugliness of dying of AIDS maybe to make it accessible to a contemporary audience, who now see AIDS as a treatable disease.

In spite of the death sentence, he does some research, finds that he can get medication better in other countries. First by going to Mexico, thenn Japan and Israel, he goes to these countries, gets some doctors on his side to help him and he's doing business helping other AIDS patients. Of course, the government, mainstream medical and authorities give him the blues, but he keeps on with it. Heck of a movie. I really wanted to see what it was that got this man the Oscar. First off, to lose some pounds, take on a character and play the heck outta it like he did, yeah, he deserved what he got. Jared Leto's performance of Rayon is spot on as well, and at first, he don't care for her, but as time goes on, they form an alliance to help one another and others as well. Jennifer Garner's performance as one of the sympathetic doctors who at first was put off by Ron's club but grudgingly gave it her respect is good as well.",1394928000,,1085,4.323529411764706

6117151,4,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew was fantastic in this role.  Can't give it five stars as some people would really be upset with the story line.  Not for mixed group watching,1394928000,,149,4.481481481481482
6117152,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I definitely felt like I had to wash my hands after watching Dallas Buyer's Club, because the scenes were so real. The acting was SUPERB! McConaughey was so believable, and the supporting actor (forgot his name at the moment-sorry) brought out so much sadness in me. Very unexpected. I watched the movie before the Oscars, but it was nice to see they got it right. Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor was well deserved.

I really enjoyed this flick, not because of the topic (stories of sick people always pull at the heart strings), but because the actors became their characters. Bravo!! Best acting I've seen in years.",1394928000,,622,4.7592592592592595
6117153,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Jean-Marc Vallee's DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is one of those films that seems to come out every few years to rightly remind us that AIDS is still a problem in this country, and how some people fight the powers that be to lead the charge to improve the quality of life of its victims. The most coverage that AIDS and HIV get in this country today is perfunctory at best and ignored at worst. And while Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give strong performances with an emphasis on immersion into their roles, they probably wouldn't have been my picks for Best Actor or Supporting Actor. There's no denying the greatness that McConaughey has achieved in the past few years alone, with films like KILLER JOE, MUD, MAGIC MIKE, BERNIE and his astounding work in HBO's TRUE DETECTIVE, but this film doesn't quite have the gravitas necessary to really support such a strong performance. And with the Academy's love of actors portraying real people, it wasn't a great surprise, but I would rather Best Actor had gone to Christian Bale in AMERICAN HUSTLE or Chiwetel Eijofor in 12 YEARS A SLAVE on the merits of their performances rather than on the merit of the film's story. Leto is similarly strong, but without the resume' of McConaughey, and I hope to see him in other films challenging expectations, and I think that's why he won. Who would ever have expected Jared Leto to win an Academy Award?

I feel that DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is less of an exploration of challenging filmmaking and more of a reminder that AIDS is still very much a problem in our time. There's nothing wrong with the film; it's fine filmmaking with very strong performances, but it just seems more of an updated version of Jonathan Demme's similiarly servicable PHILADELPHIA.",1394841600,,1735,4.745033112582782

6117156,5,B00GUO3C3W,I did not know anything about this movie beyond the fact that Matthew McConaughey was in it and that it was up for some Oscars.  I just finished watching it and was pleasantly surprised.  The movie was extremely accurate as to the medical climate regarding AZT and alternative medicines at the time.  Many of my HIV clients in the 1980's who were basically asymptomatic suffered unnecessary complications and died sooner than they would have otherwise due to AZT.  Many clients who did not listen to the medical establishment and pursued alternative therapies which were being promoted in places as the Netherlands and Israel are still alive today.  Hopefully this movie makes people think about the Rxs they are all hooked on today and maybe some people might question the efficacy and necessity of some of those drugs in contrast to alternative therapies which might have lesser or no side effects to treat their specific conditions.,1394841600,,935,5.006451612903226

Mr McConaughey won the Oscar for a reason and boy did he give a reason. He aced the role.  People don't get the sex & swearing but remember, he was playing a part of a real person and if this was how he acted then he nailed it.  Stop over analyzing movies and take them for what they are worth and this movie is well worth it's cost.  Excellent, 4 Stars, an A+++ rating.  I watched it twice in 12 hours.

6117165,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting in this film was very good. The characters were believable, if too  coarse for some tastes. But the message was clear-  government agencies, such as the FDA , are in collusion with drug companies  to promote their products and suppress any competition. Unfortunately, this is pretty understandable in today's society, where, all too often, we see corporations buying government support through lobbying and outright bribery.  I don't know how closely the movie followed a true story, but it certainly got its point across. I can readily see why it won Oscars- the people in the Academy who vote for the awards are very sympathetic towards gays and very cynical of government .",1394841600,,687,5.0

After thinking about the movie, I have decided the actors definitely deserved the acting awards. Not many actors would go to the extreme to endanger their health for a role so Matthew  deserved an award for that alone. Basically I thought his dialogue was just playing his ""good old boy"" Texas attitude. Jared Leto was terrific and a necessary addition to the script.

That's what it's about! The guy lived hard and never gave his lifestyle any thought until it was too late. Getting AIDS changed him into a somewhat decent person who finally considered other people and what they were going through. It's not a kids movie and it's not for the faint of heart or those who've lived a sheltered life; they wouldn't get it.

The real issue I have with this movie as well as ALL Amazon streaming videos is that you can't stream them to an Android tablet except for a Kindle unless you graduated with a degree in computer science.  Apparently there's a feud going on between Amazon, Google and Adobe that means that there's no Flash player available for the ENTIRE SERIES OF GALAXY TABLETS. What's odd is that there's an Amazon video player app for the iPad. I'm not saying it's impossible to do but inexplicably, Amazon who is ordinarily well-known for superior customer relations has put the entire burden on the customer to resolve. It's like we've been caught in corporate crossfire. It just doesn't seem right and fair, given that Amazon has the power to fix this.

You can, in certain circumstances stream Amazon video, but it involves, installing something called a ""Dolphin Browser"", the ""Dolphin Powerpack"", an old version of Adobe's Flash player and then tinkering with some settings.

If your interested in learning the truth about what it was like back when AIDS hit this country, then by all means watch what people had to deal with!",1394668800,,329,4.32258064516129
6117217,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey -- he of the cardboard acting, bongo drums and perennially missing shirt -- deserves every Oscar vote he got, and then some. Wow.",1394668800,,149,5.0

6117219,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This film has it all - a great and important story about a very sad time in medical and social history and a committed cast who put all of the energy into the roles.  It is a reminder of how FDA protocols and social stigmas allowed so many people to suffer from AIDS when there were strategies to help.  It is indeed a slippery slope between protecting the patient and preventing suffering, and this movie gives that dilemma human faces and stories.  I kept saying WOW as I watched scene after incredible scene.  This is definitely inspiring for storytellers and actors.

The sad ending for this film was the acceptance speech by the star ( who definitely deserved that Oscar) that omitted any mention of the human tragedy behind the story.",1394668800,,740,4.6183206106870225

After the set-up for the story, the movie took off and I think it was very good.  I've not heard anyone mention the performance of the Dr. down in Mexico.  Griffin Dunne.  I thought he did a great job with the very little he had.  He established the soul of that Dr. and his work.",1394668800,,421,4.225

It streamed wonderfully and if you want to see two of the best performaces this year then see this film.  McConaughey and Leto are amazing with wonderful supporting cast memebers like Michael O' Neill.,1394668800,,324,4.278688524590164

6117228,4,B00GUO3C3W,I was scared at the start because I didn't want to see a totally depressing movie.  But the direction of the movie totally surprised me.  It's the story of what will people have when they have a thirst to survive.  I like it.,1394668800,,225,4.186046511627907

6117233,4,B00GUO3C3W,"I am not a Matthew McConaughey fan.  But he was phenomenal in this movie.  The character he portrayed went through a profound character change.  He went from being homophobic to understanding and valuing gays as fellow travelers in life.  In many ways, however, Woodruff (the character McConaughey portrayed) remained a heel.  He was selfish and self-interested, but he also wanted to help people infected with the HIV virus.",1394668800,,425,5.1911764705882355
6117234,5,B00GUO3C3W,I had to watch after Matthew and Jared both won the Oscar.  They both deserved it.  Matthew was almost unrecognizable and so convincing. Jared was amazing. Dallas Buyers Club is an educational and entertaining take on the fascinating character of a man who refused to give up on life for himself and others diagnosed with AIDS. It also shows the harsh truth of the role that pharmaceutical companies played in exacerbating the AIDS crisis.,1394668800,,439,4.918918918918919

6117248,5,B00GUO3C3W,But so glad I did.  Leto and McConaughey - amazing acting!  Set in the early days of the aids crisis.  Raises questions about the power /control wielded by pharmaceutical industry over our doctors and hospitals. The two lead characters do not start out as  admirable human beings but you grow to care for them deeply. You want them to win even as you see them lose.

6117253,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting in this movie was worth the Oscars it received.  Jared Leto did an amazing job as Rayon, and Matthew McConaughey didn't say, ""Alright,alright,alright"" even once, for a change.  While the story was not necessarily a happy one, it was accurate for the time.  It was harder to empathize with Ron Woodward than it was Rayon.  The Academy was right, this was not the best picture of the year.",1394582400,,398,4.642857142857143

6117257,3,B00GUO3C3W,"I enjoyed the acting, but felt the pacing of the movie was slow.

6117264,4,B00GUO3C3W,"For some reason I thought this movie had some comedy in it.  It does, but very little and very hard to find.  This is a serious film about AIDS.  Although it wasn't at all what I expected, I rate it 4 stars because I learned things about the lives of people living with AIDS and HIV, and other worlds I haven't lived.  So for that reason, I feel it is a good movie for adults to see.",1394582400,,383,3.935064935064935

6117267,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Despite my preference for lighter fare when it comes to films, I thoroughly enjoyed Dallas Buyers Club. It is a great story, well told and performed marvelously well by all the actors. However, Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto stand out not only in this film, but this year. For once, well deserved Oscars.

Bravo all the way, get this film, I am certain you will enjoy it!

ps. The film does contain some disturbing scenes in connection with terminally ill, some bits of graphic sex, and is generally not holding anything back, so viewers discretion is advised. Even if I don't like those types of scenes, I did not find them too disturbing.",1394582400,,644,4.6902654867256635
6117268,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This film deserved every nomination and award it received. I'm at a loss for the right words to describe how awesome this movie is...it was so moving and thought-provoking. It took many, many years to get this film made and it was worth the wait. McConaughey and Leto are sublime in this film - they seem to disappear into their roles physically, emotionally, and spiritually. You will probably need a box of Kleenex and something fun to drink while you watch this one (I had a spiked hot chocolate), but you won't be sorry you checked it out. So amazing.",1394582400,,555,4.56

The desperation felt by newly diagnosed HIV patients, and the subsequent response from the medical profession, we have nothing to treat you, is clearly portrayed.  The imperfect science of healthcare was both correct and heartbreaking.  The relationship between McConaughey and the transgender individual(Rayon) was interesting and makes me believe that shared interests does bring unusual friendships.",1394582400,,425,5.934426229508197

There were moments of sadness (but realistic), moments of happiness and, most importantly, moments of people helping others.

I recommend this movie for anyone in their 20's and above; not because it's mildly adult nature, but it would take a certain amount of life experience and maturity to understand it.

I highly recommend this movie!",1394582400,,423,5.101449275362318
6117273,4,B00GUO3C3W,"This is a very good movie.  The acting is excellent!  But, it was difficult for me to get past the language and rauchyness of this movie. I know, I know, that's how a large part of our society lives.  I'm guessing this was a fairly close portrayal of those early AIDS days. It's sad!  The movie did a good job of conjuring up feelings for the characters even though many were not that likable.  I don't think that I'd watch it again, although my wife would.  She loved it.
We just watched ""Gravity"" last night.  I can see why the Academy of Arts & Sciences would have a hard time deciding which of these two movies and their actors were better.",1394582400,,644,4.2727272727272725

6117297,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The movie left me feeling something was missing. More time should have been given to the relationships between Ron Woodruff and the 'friends"" he made.  I also thought Ron became more interested in helping people than in making money and the movie did not show enough of that at the end.  Leto was amazing but the introduction of his character into the story was too abrupt.  I still recommend the movie to everyone, even teenagers.",1394582400,,431,4.72
6117298,4,B00GUO3C3W,"They both did a great job playing there roles. I was left with wanting more.  More detail, more of the characters interactIon.
Still really good.",1394582400,,145,4.8

6117303,5,B00GUO3C3W,Marvelous movie. Both men deserved the Oscar for their performance. One of the rare instances where the Oscar went to the right people. I've always been a fan of McConaughey and I'm glad to see he's finally being recognized. Recommend this movie to everyone.,1394582400,,258,4.886363636363637

6117306,5,B00GUO3C3W,Wow I understand why Matthew McConaughey received the Oscar for this movie. An amazing film that angered me in the thought that these companies do this today .,1394582400,,159,4.714285714285714
6117307,4,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew is a great actor but in all the directing was fabulous as well. I would suggest it to be a must see.,1394582400,,108,3.739130434782609
6117308,5,B00GUO3C3W,A must see for anyone over I would say eighteen a great cast and based on a true story well worth the price,1394582400,,107,3.6956521739130435
6117309,5,B00GUO3C3W,Both McConaughey and Leto gave outstanding performances. I would recommend this movie. Hard movie to watch though because of the language.,1394582400,,138,5.619047619047619
6117310,5,B00GUO3C3W,I thought that it was very good.  The movie was very interesting too.  I didn't know that this sort of thing happened in the 80s.,1394582400,,129,4.12
6117311,5,B00GUO3C3W,Great movie. The era was very well represented and Matthew Mcconaghey absolutely smashed his role. Very much worth the watch.,1394582400,,125,5.3
6117312,5,B00GUO3C3W,It was an amazing movie! I loved it and can't wait to see it again! For sure worth seeing twice!,1394582400,,96,3.85
6117313,5,B00GUO3C3W,awesome movie.well deserved oscars earned in this . i really didn't want it to end! I love it when well known actors fall so deep in the character you forget who your watching.,1394496000,,176,4.363636363636363
6117314,5,B00GUO3C3W,This movie was very good  people should watch and see what  drugs and sex can do to you Matthew Maconahey was wonderful,1394496000,,119,4.363636363636363

6117316,4,B00GUO3C3W,"McConaughey has morphed into an actor whose acting ability trumps his looks.  There are outstanding performances by other cast members as well.  The subject matter and the unfiltered approach to storytelling makes this hard to watch at times.  This film is not for folks who are offended by fowl language or homosexual and transgender behavior.  It is based upon a true story about a hard-living oilfield trash rodeo cowboy and his battle with AIDS.  It includes his battle with the medical and pharmaceutical institutions, neither of which offered him any real help .  The film has a heavy bias against the FDA and its drug approval process, which is a primary plot of the film.  If the story was not true, it would not be believable. It is surreal what this man achieves in his attempt to save his own life.  He helped many others in the process.  The filmmakers succeeded with invoking many diverse emotional reactions in scene after scene.",1394496000,,943,4.807453416149069
6117317,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Based on a true story, this movie is about the redemption of Ron Woodroof, superbly played by Matthew McConaughey.  The movie depicts realistically the prejudice and lack of understanding of HIV/Aids patients in the early days...just an outstanding movie.  McConaughey richly deserved the Oscar.",1394496000,,295,5.681818181818182

6117319,4,B00GUO3C3W,Seeing Matthew McConoughy so very thin was difficult to watch.  I realize the weight loss was needed to authenticate the story. Enjoyed the performance of Jared Leto - true professional. I enjoyed the movie very much,1394496000,,216,5.0
6117320,5,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew McConaughey brilliantly portrays his character and the story is amazing! Better than 12 Years a Slave - this should have gotten best picture.,1394496000,,149,5.25
6117321,3,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew McConaughey at his best.  He has finally outgrown his pretty boy image and is becoming a real fine actor.  The story is good reminder of the effects of HIV.  Love Leto as well.,1394496000,,184,4.352941176470588
6117322,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew M. is really hitting his stride now as an actor, playing Ron Woodroof, a homophobic rodeo rider turned activist and medicine supplier who is stricken with HIV in the mid 80s.  Jared Leto provides strong support in his role as the fictional Rayon, who assists Ron with his efforts.",1394496000,,288,4.76
6117323,5,B00GUO3C3W,While based on truth.... you really hope this movie is not. BUT the battle with the government to get the drugs you need to fight an epidemic disease was unfortunately true then as it is now. I hope this beautifully acted movie can be a spark in the rehabilitation of the FDA/BIG PHARMA system that sadly is in the sales business. We must get to the root of the problem and do away with PACs and Lobbyists!,1394496000,,406,4.285714285714286
6117324,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Great story, & I can see why both Oscar's went to the two main male actors from this film! Great quick stroll through a rather unenlightened period of our history, both educational & entertaining! A rather dark & scary period in American history, told through a very character driven script! The acting alone is reason to watch, keeping you drawn into the story, but also an intelligent script to help you stay entertained! At times the story line, takes you to a point where it's uncomfortable, but never so bad you turn away!",1394496000,,527,4.67741935483871
6117325,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey, OUTSTANDING in this movie.  A movie that should have been made years ago to open the eyes to HIV.  Well done by a Texas boy!!",1394496000,,146,4.37037037037037
6117326,5,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew McConaughey is great.  As is Jerod Leto (didn't even recognize him).  Definitely recommed watching this if you haven't already.,1394496000,,135,5.7
6117327,5,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew was wonderful in this! The story very timely as this is still a issue. Glad for your movie service,1394496000,,106,4.35
6117328,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey is fantastic. I didn't know he was capable of this kind of performance. I recommend True Detective on HBO as well, he's even better in that series along side Woody Harrelson.",1394496000,,194,4.909090909090909
6117329,5,B00GUO3C3W,"The movie is about a straight rodeo cowboy that contracts aids during the early days of the epidemic, and the challenges he faces from friends, the medical community, support groups, and alternative treatments.  The development of true friendship in some very unlikely places is humorous to the point of being painful at times.  This movie is incredibly well done in a rich fabric of Aids reality, portrayed so well as to be uncomfortable by the stars and their supporting cast.  The dedication and commitment of this cast is impossible to describe effectively; ""impressive"" does not do it justice.",1394409600,,598,5.081632653061225
6117330,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Excellent acting, especially from Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey. Philadelphia was a stronger film, but this was definitely worth renting.",1394409600,,142,6.15
6117331,3,B00GUO3C3W,I thought Dallas Buyers Club was somewhat of a disappointment simply due to all of the hype behind it. I enjoyed the story very much but it seemed to drag out far too long. A highlight of this movie is Jared Leto. He was incredible and I honestly would have never known it was him if I didn't know beforehand. I'm planning on watching it a second time to see if I missed anything the first time.,1394409600,,395,4.142857142857143
6117332,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Watch this movie for his performance alone (especially if you're a fan of True Detective - there's some character similarity and he does both roles so well).

The storyline was not bad, but he pushed the movie over the top & brought it to life.",1394409600,,244,4.4222222222222225
6117333,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Very good movie. Not 5 star worthy, but good nonetheless. McConaughey was brilliant and shows the world how he is so much more than than that funny, romantic comedy guy. It's definitely worth watching.",1394409600,,201,4.9411764705882355
6117334,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Incredible movie. Fantastic acting.  The issues with the FDA as shown in this movie have not changed.  Priority is still given to the Pharmaceutical Companies and what they pay instead of recognizing positive result in other countries in drug trials / testing.  It should remain the individual's choice on what they feel is the best course of action to treat their illness/disease.  Changes in legislation is being pushed regarding Medical Marijuana and debates continue.  While anyone can research treatment options, in the United States individuals are still not allowed to have access to treatment option without FDA authorization.",1394409600,,634,5.428571428571429
6117335,4,B00GUO3C3W,Great movie. Matthew McConaughey completely transformed himself and Jared Leto was equally amazing. I love watching real stories and even though I knew the ending it was very interesting to see all the twists and turns through the movie.,1394409600,,237,5.102564102564102
6117336,5,B00GUO3C3W,This was an outstanding movie. I love that it was informative and touching. Sometimes tough to watch but it was a powerful performance.,1394409600,,135,4.913043478260869

6117338,3,B00GUO3C3W,"First of all, I ordered this movie in HD, and apparently my DSL internet connection was not fast enough to download the HD version and amazon still charged me for the HD version!

I would give the movie 3 stars - only because it was a great job by the lead actor, Matthew McConehgy (or however you spell his name).

Other than that, I would give NO stars. It was an extremely depressing movie.",1394409600,,393,4.297297297297297

6117340,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Grade-A performances from McConaughey, Leto, and Garner. McConaughey really makes you despise his character and Leto's breaks your heart. This is a story about trying to survive with AIDS.

But the meat of this movie is a surprising statement (coming from Hollywood) about how vile and disgusting the FDA and Big Pharma are, as well as the doctors that turn a blind eye to the corruption, greed, and destructiveness that modern medicine imbues. ""Do no harm"" indeed.",1394409600,,465,5.038961038961039

6117343,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthews seemed to relish his role, and I loved his work. Film is so good, just wish it had been made 20 years ago. The fact that McC was willing to lose all that weight should not overshadow the very fine acting work he did.",1394409600,,225,4.022222222222222

6117347,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie based on a real life story was exceptional. The acting was truly Academy Award winning. Both my husband and I highly recommend it.

6117348,1,B00GUO3C3W,What a disappointment. My large screen Vizio TV came with this Amazon movie as part of its app setup. Even has an Amazon logo button on the remote. Twice now I have tried to rent a movie. When it gets to the screen to download it just sits there and the move never downloads or plays. I have upgraded high speed internet at home and it was working. In fact I just went to Netflix which also is part of the Vizio app package and it worked flawlessly. I did some research online and discovered many people have this issue. What a disappointment.,1394409600,,543,4.281553398058253
6117349,5,B00GUO3C3W,Tough and interesting to watch. Good performances with great moments. Matthew McConaughey reminded me a lot of Freddie Mercury. Definite watch.,1394409600,,143,5.857142857142857
6117350,5,B00GUO3C3W,This movie reminds me that a passion can be awakened out of adversity.  Matthew McConaughey was amazing . . . as well as the balance of the cast.,1394409600,,145,4.178571428571429

6117358,3,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConghey was himself in this movie.  That is a pretty good thing to be.  Just like John Wayne was always John Wayne no matter what role he played.  Even with a pretty amazing physical transformation, you never forget for a moment that it is MM you are watching.  The character he played in this movie could have just as easily been arrested for MM's own naked bongo drum playing arrest in Austin.  I always enjoy watching MM and have most likely watched 100% of his movies.  It is fun seeing how MM reacts to different movie roles.  But I do wonder what the real character was like.  Someday I would like to see if MM could pull off a total character transformation such as Gladiator vs. Beautiful Mind.  Until then I will just continue enjoying watching MM play himself in whatever next movie he stars in.",1394409600,,815,4.489795918367347
6117359,4,B00GUO3C3W,"It is so heart wrenching that this disease came on so strong and out of nowhere.  The early days, as depicted in this movie, show how scary and strange the early days were.  It is an insight into what it meant to those affected and what lengths had to be gone to for treatment.",1394409600,,277,4.111111111111111
6117360,4,B00GUO3C3W,This was a good movie but I could have done with less of the sexually explicit shots. They were pretty gross and actually made me queesy. Other than that the story was well told and the acting was quite good.,1394409600,,208,4.225
6117361,4,B00GUO3C3W,It started off a bit slow but turned out to be a pretty good movie.  Both Matthew McConnaughey & Jennifer Garner were excellent.  I wouldn't rank it in my top 10 (or top 50 for that matter) but would recommend to others.  Not a bad flick.,1394409600,,238,4.130434782608695
6117362,5,B00GUO3C3W,"It is well acted and I found the story very compelling.  Definitely makes you question some of the assumptions you may have about the FDA.  I think the most interesting part is how he sets out to find life prolonging drugs,  sees a opportunity to make money, and ultimately is brought to see the humanity of people he definitely would not have associated with in his prior life.  I went into this thinking I would not like but actually found it quite good.  Again,  its not a happy ending story.",1394409600,,495,4.444444444444445
6117363,5,B00GUO3C3W,Both McConaughey & Leto's performances were as strong as any I've seen in the last couple years.  If you would shy away from a subject that makes you uncomfortable you would miss out on a performance by McConaughey that is cementing his reputation this year (see True Detective and his small supporting part in Wolf Of Wall Street).  I would definitely recommend this.,1394409600,,368,4.825396825396825

6117365,5,B00GUO3C3W,Great acting and the story was original but kinda like blow with drugs that are good for you. I could not get over how skinny Mathew mcconahey was... kinda disturbing. I would revomend this movie to almost anyone.,1394409600,,213,4.631578947368421

6117367,1,B00GUO3C3W,Way too much graphic sex and four letter words get in the way of the story line.  Thought that Rayon was the best part of this movie.,1394409600,,133,3.925925925925926
6117368,3,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting in this film was incredibly good. There was however, in my view, scenes which were unnecessary, because they made the same points as previous scenes, which made the picture overly long. It is still a movie worth seeing though.",1394409600,,237,4.804878048780488
6117369,4,B00GUO3C3W,McConaughey amazing.  Well acted by the entire cast.  Powerful story of the desperation of an AIDS diagnosis in those early days.  Thought-provoking about government over regulation.  The impact of the law of unintended consequences plays out in this film in so many ways.,1394409600,,272,5.255813953488372

6117373,5,B00GUO3C3W,Wow really good movie McConaughey looks so skinny. I don't like that about the movie. But over all worth watching,1394409600,,113,4.7
6117374,5,B00GUO3C3W,MM was certainly not a likeable character in this movie..and if the historical info is correct on AZT then they are disturbing since I had several friends who died of AIDS in that era...it was worth the view - great performances.,1394409600,,229,4.609756097560975

6117390,4,B00GUO3C3W,"After watching the academy awards, we decided it was time to see some of the movies we missed. This is definitely an adult movie due to explicit sexual content and language. Kudos to Matthew McConaughey for tackling this difficult and often ugly role. It reflected a time when AIDS was no longer just a disease of homosxuals and IV drug users.

6117399,4,B00GUO3C3W,I'm a huge McConaughey fan & I was a tad disappointed in this one!!!  I think it was the subject matter because it was a deeply dark subject.  Plus the fact that he lost over 40 pounds to play the part which greatly decreased his sexiness!!!  He did do some great acting mainly because he couldn't rely on his eyes & smile to get him through this one.  I wish I had rented this one first & I could have saved on buying it!!!

6117403,2,B00GUO3C3W,"Like ""Wolf of Wall Street"", this movie was a waste of talents for McConaughey. I was totally disappointed in the graphic sexual activity in both movies and actually left the theater 1/3 of the way into ""Wolf"". The same message could have been transferred without using the f word every other syllable and the blatant sexual acts portrayed. I felt like I was watching pornography- physically sickening.",1394323200,,401,5.0

6117409,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Superb acting. Important story that needed to be told.

6117410,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Mr. McConaughey gives the performance of his career, with Mr. Leto impressing us with his acting chops in a touching, gritty and harrowing story of a man who fights to live only to be harassed by mindless bureaucracy and meaningless red-tape. Jennifer Garner is fine as the doctor faced with a challenge to rethink her convictions and methods. This movie is unflinching in its portrayal of a people fighting to survive AIDS and HIV. Be prepared to reconsider your own heart with all you think you know with this gritty and detailed production.",1394323200,,543,4.849462365591398

6117412,5,B00GUO3C3W,This is a great movie both in the screenplay and the acting. Matthew McConaughey was amazing and deserved best actor,1394323200,,116,4.85
6117413,5,B00GUO3C3W,"A realistic, gritty portrayal of the emotional and physical struggle for survival in the face of stigma and bureaucratic blockades. A very real human drama, set in an era of historical significance for our country, the Dallas Buyers Club expands your mind and leaves you with a new understanding of AIDS patients as the epidemic was exploding into our consciousness.

Matthew Mconaughey and Jered Leto's performances were incredible! Not only the physical changes - incredible weight loss for each for this film - but the way each immersed themselves in their characters.

Prior to watching this movie I was not aware that it was based on a true story. I was also not aware that 'buyers clubs' were apparently springing up in several states as a result of AZT being the only FDA approved treatment for AIDS in the mid 80's.

My brother died of AIDs in 1989, making this subject close to my heart. 1993's 'Philadelphia' addressed AIDS in a different way - as something attacking the gay community. The Dallas Buyers Club shows AIDS from a different perspective - a straight man who had unprotected sex with multiple partners, who out of a desperate desire to survive, discovers a course of treatment that works. It's not federally approved, and thus, he has to break the law to get it to his 'buyers club' customers who tend to be members of the gay community with HIV and AIDS. He is not an angel, he wants to make money off of it and initially that's his only desire. Over time, he is made better - more compassionate - and becomes an advocate for all.

This film is very well done, and thought provoking. I highly recommend it.",1394323200,2,1629,4.665505226480836
6117414,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey delivered a performance that has now put him in a different realm as an actor. It's his time and he willed himself to accomplish this. For whatever reasons, he gave many, the stars are aligned for him to keep entertaining the audience with stellar performances. He proved himself portraying this character that acquired aids, at a time when there was no hope. Right away you don't feel like you are watching McConaughey. He becomes an aids patient. He deserved his Oscar. Jared Leto also put in a top notch performance as well. His Oscar also was well deserved too
I really enjoyed this movie, albeit disturbing subject matter.",1394323200,,647,4.890909090909091

6117417,5,B00GUO3C3W,"McConaughey and Leto certainly deserved their awards for these performances. McConaughey lost 47 pounds for the role and Leto is convincing, although his screen time is limited. Many have won supporting Oscars for less screen time.
This isn't what I would call entertainment, but the true story doesn't need embellishment, and the journey of the protagonist certainly holds our attention because of McConaughy's carefully crafted performance.",1394323200,,442,5.712121212121212
6117418,4,B00GUO3C3W,Aids is a terrible disease and this story showed all sides of it including the alienation of those who contracted it even by their closest friends.

However, not a happy go lucky movie, so if you are looking for something light-hearted and funny, this is not the movie to watch. Matthew McConaughey was excellent in this role, and I can see why he won best actor for that role. This movie is definitely worth watching.",1394236800,,319,4.423728813559322

But it is a depressing movie and it is indeed a ""lesson"" movie that will ruin your Friday or Saturday night.  The main message is that heterosexual homophobic tough guys can get aids and then find out that all of their white male friends are really intolerant homophobes and haters - and that gays are really understanding and loving people.  It seems more like a documentary.  You can certainly see why the Hollywood crowd voted Matthew M. the best actor.  This movie isn't even close to being as good as ""American Hustle,"" where all of the acting is outstanding and you don't end up feeling like you had to watch a sex education class under the tutorship of Nurse Ratchett.",1394236800,,748,4.511111111111111

6117443,4,B00GUO3C3W,"DBC tells the tale of electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) in 1985 who works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is himself diagnosed with the disease.

DBC tells a gritty, hardcore, realistic story that at times made me a bit uncomfortable to watch but it also tells it like it was back in the mid 80's when this unknown disease developed a 4 letter moniker that terrified the population in differing ways. Those who had the disease and were promptly given a death sentence by not only the disease but by the medical community at large who at the time were at a loss at what to do to stem the tide of the disease. Also those who failed to understand anything about what was going on and choose to instead treat those who had the disease as outcasts. Realistically very little attention was being paid to the disease until well known personalities died from it (such as Rock Hudson and Freddy Mercury, among others.)

This movie pulls no punches with lots of foul language, sex and drug use but also gives us a decent story to watch and a character (to love and hate at the same time). McConaughey does an outstanding job at playing the homophobic, womanizing, drinking, drug using rodeo cowboy who contracts the disease. His portrayal appeared very realistic even to the point of his weigh loss making him look even more the part. Jarrod Leto also does well in his supporting role as the cross dressing drug addicted patient that teams up with Woodruff to fight the powers that be to get medicine to those suffering. Whether you agree or disagree with Woodruffs methods, his tenacity throughout the story is inspirational, even though his character flaws make him at the same time very unlikeable.

DBC is an emotionally charged movie no matter how you feel about the subject and is designed well enough to give you a realistic look at the subject with warts and all. With McConaughey and Leto's excellent performances, this movie is a worthwhile watch at 3.5 stars.",1394236800,2,2023,4.692957746478873

So disappointed in ALL of those films and judging from the reviews I am not alone. This one, however, was an eye-opener.  Not only is it a true story, but it highlights the plight of ALL those in America who are sick and cannot get the meds they need due to Big Pharma and the FDA!.  Matthew McConaughey well deserved the Oscar he won.  Amazing acting all through the film.  I have always heard if you are really sick, go to Europe.

6117475,4,B00GUO3C3W,"If you loved movies from the 70's- the mature intelligent scripting and the open endedness which pointed to the absurdity and irony found in real life, then you will absolutely enjoy this film.

It is, as many reviewers have pointed out, the story of one man taking on big pharma and the FDA in his quest to obtain life prolonging medicines for himself and his clients after being diagnosed with the Aids virus. It is also, in a sense, about a journey from intolerance to acceptance, as our homophobic hero, Ron, humanizes and discovers he has some tender and empathic feelings for those he previously despised.

And while I admired Ron's Texas can do attitude in that he both refused to bow to authority and discovered better alternatives to the glaring problems of sanctioned Aids medicines, what I loved above all else, unlike many of the reviewers who gave this film low ratings,  was the joie de vivre of the principle characters.

Ron never regrets or apologizes for his lifestyle choices. He lived the life he loved - filled with cheap women, raw sex, gambling, booze and rodeo and despite being  a skilled electrician and extremely bright, he reveled in it. So too did Rayon, the very charming transgender woman played by Jared Leto in a remarkable performance. Rayon is softer and a bit sadder than Ron, but doesn't hesitate to call out all of Ron's biases and stupidities and bring him to earth. Also remarkable is the one glimpse we get into Rayon's back story which is shocking. I found it strangely liberating that these two wildly disparate people had had the guts to live out their own truth, freely and without hypocrisy.
Wonderful performances by McConaughey, Leto and an unrecognizable Griffin Dunne as the charming, aged hippie doctor, Vass. Recommended. If you like it and haven't seen them , Milk [ about Harvey Milk ] and Kiss of the Spider Woman are phenomenal films on somewhat similar topics",1394150400,,1916,4.793939393939394

6117480,3,B00GUO3C3W,Would not put it on my top ten movies for the year.  It was difficult to feel sympathy for a bigoted redneck who really only saved lives because he was interested in saving his own and making money off of the misfortune of others. As for Leto while his performance is stallar I found it hard to pull for someone who was constantly pumping and snorting hard core drugs into her/his body..,1394150400,,387,4.375
6117481,3,B00GUO3C3W,"Reading through reviews her and IMDB is something of a confounding experience.  Both mysterious and confusing at the same time.

Many negative reviews focus on the subject matter, ethics/morals of the characters, or find the language objectionable. In whole or separately it's hard to imagine, in general, WHAT those negative reviewers EXPECTED.

Perhaps they find the story and plot not to their appetite and the emotional response the main character has to his infection affronting to their prudent and puritanical taste, If so, I say to those viewers, you need to start choosing PG and PG-13 movies instead of films with grown up, reality based material. Aside from the fact that the story's scenarios was based on real life events I found all of them germane to the plot and situations. Why wouldn't a desperate man look ANYWHERE worldwide for help if they don't feel they're getting it at home! Who with such a deadly and seemingly hopeless medical condition would express their thoughts and feelings in any other way than angry, could language. How is it not comprehensible that anyone in Ron Woodruff's condition would be frustrated by his ""objectionable"" perspective

For those super impressed, overzealous positive reviewers I wonder - were you watching the same movie I was? The story lines and characters were as thin as generic tissue paper, the direction and editing erratic and often visually non sensical and the logic (or lack thereof) of how the story lines unfolded impractical.

In general the acting was 3rd rate (not even 2nd rate) and not especially believable (think Bradley Cooper in most anything..although I thought he was pretty darn good in ""American Hustle"").

The relationships were immature, generally under-developed and lacking in subtlety or nuance. Some of the interactions between Woodruff and the local police came off pretty nicely however and I could sense the officers' ambivalence between loyalty to their jobs and humanity for their neighbors.

This was especially rewarding in the conclusion of the first scene when Ron Woodruff makes off with his false gambling winnings in hopes of getting away from his pursuers by instead getting arrested by a police officer. When at first the officer doesn't comply  to ""get Ron off the hook"" (by hauling him away from his pursuers) he DOES arrest him after they exchange blows ignited by Ron. Instead of bringing him to police HQ the officer drops Ron off at his home. That was a really nice touch - so much accomplished and communicated in a few simple moments. The forced handshake in the Supermarket, near the end of the film, was yet another nice moment where people in difficult situations were able to communicate their humanity.

But these sparks of humanity were few and far between and the core surrounding them was poor acting, slow story and character development, saccharine & melodramatic moments and uninspired directing and editing.

Dallas Buyers Club teeters on the edge of my ""Two Hour Rule"" (ie.: If it's over two hours it better be Citizen Kane). For my enjoyment of 5 minutes of this film there's a delta of 112 from my life that I'll never get back.",1394150400,,3154,4.9904761904761905

The Oscars that were recently won by the actors in this movie are highly deserved.

Matthew McConaughey was excellent! He deserved the Best Actor Oscar in my opinion. Jared Leto (whom I had never heard of before) gave a more than worthy Best Supporting Actor performance.

I didn't give it five stars only b/c I think the story line stretched the truth about the facts and circumstances surrounding the antagonists' (i.e. drug companies, FDA, and Reagan Administration) intentions during that period. Can't be certain, but I suspect a lot of creative license was used in the story. I highly doubt it was as black and white as they make it all out to be.

Politics aside, it's a well made movie with solid acting performances. And to its credit, the story does make you think twice about our U.S. regulatory approach to testing and approving new drugs to fight new diseases.

I am appalled. Having a strong connection to the medical world, I have minimal doubt about the truths portrayed.

6117558,2,B00GUO3C3W,"Let me first say that I fell asleep during the movie and had to go back and try to figure out what the actual story line was, once my nap ended.  I personally do not find interest in the slimy lifestyle, so perhaps my lack of interest in hookers and drug addiction caused the drowsiness.  It was all I could do to understand why McConaughey put his health at risk, losing so much weight.  This fact was very distracting to me throughout the movie.

 If it takes a lot for a straight man to play a transvestite, then Leto was convincing, but other than the dresses and makeup, I found little redeeming action in his performance.  If you want to see an excellent performance by McConaughey, check out ""Time to Kill"", one of his first movies and his best so far.

The story initiates slowly and then fast forwards by flashing the amount of time that has elapsed between issues/chapters.  I think there are more effective ways to tell a story, and it seems to me representative of sheer incompetence in a director.  It's sort of like traveling down a road and taking a detour before you get back on path, where most of us just like to ride through.

That being said, this movie was not, is not and will never be deserving of an Oscar nomination.  It is boring, indicative of Hollywood's low standards in releasing movies today and is yet another movie promoted on the basis of the ""poor social outcast mode"".  If the story is important, it is because the FDA is remiss in doing its job.  That issue is neither about homosexuality or homophobia, as is suggested by promoters and viewers.

Succinctly stated,  I did not find anyone's performance here to be captivating.  Jennifer Garner was equally boring in her role, so some might ask why she did not receive an Oscar?  Is it because she didn't pretend to have AIDS?

If you have some time to kill, no pun intended, and need a nap with background sound, go for it.  If you want to spend quality time....leave this one in the box!",1394064000,,1975,4.466480446927374

Oh, please - ::gag::  A teeny, tiny notation at the end states (in whatever words) that AZT in lower doses saved millions of lives, but not one word on the triple blind studies saying peptide-t does no more than a placebo.

The acting was okay - but nothing to rave about, and the overwhelming disregard for any facts made any high points ridiculous.  'Composite characters' that never existed (Rayon and the doctor), rolled up a fawning adoration for character traits of homophobia, misogyny, drugs/alcohol use and general douche-baggery that the movie wants to somehow present as redeeming themselves - like those qualities are okay as long as you hug the transexual eventually.

6117582,4,B00GUO3C3W,"In the early days of what we call now the AIDS epidemic, people didn't know how they got it or what they could do to stay alive. AZT was the only thing that worked, and it was like the early days of chemotherapy for cancer: the cure was worse than the disease, unless what you really wanted to do was to live, at which point you would put up with awful side effects in order to stay alive. This is a story of one man who devoted his life to keeping alive, crossing borders and breaking laws to get the drugs he needed to stay ahead of the disease, and in the process helped unknown hundreds of others with AIDS to eke out a few more months or years in their lives before their immune systems totally crashed and they died.  How he did it and how long he kept on doing it is the story.

At one level, it is like watching ""Titanic:"" You know the ship is going to sink and everybody you care about is going to die. People die ""movie deaths"" in this show, and while it's not pretty to watch, it doesn't come close to the horrible ways some people died because of AIDS.  If you have known the disease since the late 1980s, as I have, you know what AZT toxicity does, and how the opportunistic infections that kill you with AIDS act on your body and what you can look like when you're circling the drain. None of that in this film, and if you had seen a little more of it you would have understood the screaming horror that so many faced in the days before anti-retrovirals.  But this is not a documentary about the FDA turning its back on ""unproven"" drugs that worked sometimes, and the lives that so many people lived in self-experimentation and self-medication, the hundreds of people whose lives became one elaborate self-created clinical trial after another.  It's the story of one angry man who didn't understand why he was dealt the hand that Fate had given him, but he was not going to give up to the disease or the bureaucracy or the law, and in so doing he was going to stay afloat for another hundred days and hold up some others with him instead of dragging them down. And by the end of the movie, the ship has gone down and everybody you care about is gone, but in the process you have seen a lot of bravery and a lot of determination and a lot of ways that people make up their mind that whatever it costs, they want to live one more day.",1394064000,,2346,4.204444444444444

6117588,5,B00GUO3C3W,Great movie crazy to see what people will do and learn to survive.  I treat pts with HIV so this story was an important history lesson on what treatment use to be like for people.,1393977600,,179,4.114285714285714

6117592,5,B00GUO3C3W,I thought Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto gave excellent performances of their real life counterparts.  A thought provking movie.  It  made you think about the FDA and why certain drugs are put into production and others aren't.  I know drug manufacturers are in the business to make money but can only hope morality backs their decisions..The movie also provokes you to feel empathy for others even though you may not share their lifestyle.,1393977600,,444,5.041095890410959

6117598,3,B00GUO3C3W,"It's a very emotional movie.  It's well-acted and over-acted.  It's abrasive-as it should be, given its topic. At its heart is a character with tremendous will to live and a system seemingly trying to kill him.  The portrayal of the FDA's approach to keeping drugs unavailable and the drug companies' rampant abuse of the market during the initial stages of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the US is spot on.  Still, I don't feel as though the movie had a heart.",1393977600,,453,4.625

6117606,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting in this is awesome and the story line is too. However, read a little bit about the actual character it's based on because it turns out he was quite homophobic and Rayon never existed... Just another Hollywood spin.",1393977600,,225,4.65
6117607,5,B00GUO3C3W,Decided to watch this just before the Oscars.  Stellar performance by all of the actors!  Makes one wonder why the FDA continually fights to keep medicines off the shelf that will help victims of these types of diseases while they allow the food industry to saturate our grocery shelves with crap that is killing us slowly on a daily basis....incredible.,1393977600,,354,4.883333333333334

6117614,5,B00GUO3C3W,Jarod Leto and Matthew McConaughey deserved their Oscars.  A very poignant look at not just the AIDS epidemic but at mans ability to persevere despite staring death in the face.,1393977600,,177,4.9

6117621,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are amazing in their roles and their commitment to their craft.  The movie needs to be seen once if only for the historical perspective.  The FDA is taken to task for its cumbersome, unfeeling methods ie.. dollars not humans.  This is not a movie that you'll ever think, ""Gosh I'd like to see that again.""  Rent it.  Don't buy it.",1393977600,,365,4.553846153846154

Many of us have forgotten or never knew about the AIDS drug issues and this is what the movie is about.  It is not about people slowly dying of AIDS, it about people with AIDS fight like hell to get drugs that really work.  Don't miss watching this movie, but make sure the kids are in bed first.",1393977600,,440,4.253012048192771
6117629,1,B00GUO3C3W,"I have enjoyed this actor's previous performances in several pictures. The level of swearing and gratuitous sex was so far over the top that one has to wonder who was sending what message in this film. Hollywood's decades old dearth of creative and good storytelling is visible in their current dependence on remaking old films and stories but with modernized features to include both homo and heterosexual sex, drug use and rampant foul language. It would appear that these values more typify the behaviors of those involved with the motion picture industry and that they are desperately trying to convince the rest of us that they are normal.
In sum I did not like this film and turned to Netflix before the halfway point. Not impressed. Save your money.",1393977600,4,756,4.868217054263566

6117643,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Having lost a best friend to AIDS, this movie was haunting, but meaningful.  Matthew McConaughey's performance was convincing and compelling, and anyone who got caught up in the sleazier side of rodeo life and missed out on the true path to redemption should be watching cartoons instead. Jared Leto's performance may have been the most poignant portrayal of a dying person I have ever seen.  And once I again, I was reminded that our path to approval for life saving drugs is caught up in the same bureaucratic jungle today that it was 40 years ago, marred by influence peddling, political red tape and prejudices and pre-copernican religious beliefs.",1393977600,,652,4.972477064220183

6117646,3,B00GUO3C3W,"Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for several awards. As a result of those nomination, I purchased the movie. I am not a fan of Matthew McConaughey so without the award nominations, I wouldn't have rented this movie. I usually do not explain a movie when giving a review but a short explanation is necessary when explaining a rating for Dallas Buyers Club. In the 1980s when cases of the unknown HIV virus was new to the United States, the general population thought the virus was only contracted by gays. They didn't know it could be transmitted by IV drug users.. The movie is about a man who was not gay but was infected by an IV drug user. His friends abandoned him. He was not a saint. He found drugs not approved by the FDA but helped to keep him healthy so he sold them to customers who could pay a membership fee for club which gave out the drug.. As a patient, the character played by McConaughey looked for treatment other than AZT. He found he remained healthy from drugs manufactured outside the U.S. and let his ""club members"" purchase these drugs.  He cared only about himself. If an infected person asked for the drugs he purchased outside the U.S., he only distributed these drugs if the individual had the Club's monthly membership fee.
I think the movie was suppose to glorify this man's search for drugs that would treat the HIV virus but he was a selfish man who shared his findings only if an infected man/woman could pay his fee.  I don't know what the viewer was expected to take from this movie. My feelings that after meeting other people who contracted HIV, the character played by McConaughey could have cared about others. The movie showed a selfish man who wasn't ready to accept the death sentence of HIV but wouldn't share his life extending finding unless he was paid. My overall feelings about the main character and the movie was negative. I hope for more humanity. Maybe the movie was realistic but I don't know. I would watch a movie that was inspiring rather than a movie  about nothing more than greed. My review is includes my personal feelings. A more objective critic might give it a more positive review.",1393891200,,2150,4.579220779220779

6117650,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto give powerful and lively performances as AIDS sufferers who must battle for their lives against a medical establishment that limits treatments to those controlled by the drug companies and shuts off access to alternative therapies, sometimes even in the face of evidence that the FDA's '""approved"" treatments have negative results.

Hopefully this is a permanent change for him.  This movie is based on real people and actual events from the early days of AIDS and shows one man's battle against a death sentence.  It is a reminder, if you had forgotten or are too young to have known, of how things were in the beginning, only gays got AIDS, and if a ""straight"" got it he must really not have been straight so people weren't too concerned about finding a cure.  Then some high profile people got AIDS.  Investigation revealed that they got it from blood transfusions, donated blood wasn't tested in those days, and it was realized that everybody was subject to being infected.  This movie is a bit of a downer but is well done and has as acting as good as any you will ever see.  It is well worth watching.",1393891200,,921,4.313953488372093

Granted, it is raw and raunchy and sexually explicit in some parts, but the subject matter brings up so many issues about modern healthcare/pharmaceuticals, the law, government regulations, stigma, homophobia, human rights, prejudice, addiction (drugs/alcohol/sex), love, friendship, grace and forgiveness.  Actually, you as the viewer will be compelled to forgive Matthew McConaughey's character by the end, because boy does it seem like he's getting what he deserves at the start.  This is a movie about hope.  Go watch it!",1393891200,,639,5.35

6117670,5,B00GUO3C3W,"It was sad but that is what happens when people pre judged aids.
I had friends die from it but it was because the blood transfusions were tainted. It was before they tested for aids.
A great show for those who want the F.D. A. to get a move on new meds used everywhere else that work....",1393891200,2,287,4.052631578947368
6117671,2,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie bothered me for many reasons.  It would be as if 12 Years a Slave had been told from the point of view of the Slave Master who was suffering from tired arms after whipping his housekeeper.

What I mean is the protagonist is not a very likeable or likely hero in the Battle for Our Lives in the War on AIDS.  He's an ugly womanizing homophobe with a single redeeming quality, that being, he's tenacious as hell.  But aren't we all when our lives are on the line?  But this is called The Dallas Buyers Club and not The War on AIDS.  There is talk that it doesn't reflect the reality of Ron Woodruff, who some claim was bisexual.  But really, who cares?

This was 2 movies. The first movie is the movie seen by those who know AIDS as something someone else has to worry about.  That's the majority of Americans.  They seem to like this movie and the characters as portrayed by McC and Leto.  We see him lose everything except his dignity on the way down and then we see him use his dignity as currency to rebuild his life even as those around him are losing theirs.  One of the saddest moments was when a straight woman shows up at his DBC and in the same moment we learn with him that she has full blown AIDS we hear them screwing their brains out and we understand.  I'm not sure we'd be as understanding if this was a movie about gays and it was two men doing that.

Which brings me to the other movie.  And that's the film seen by those of us who have survived this long as the plague took everyone we knew and flushed them down the toilet of life.  For us this plague started as someone turned the lights out on the Disco ball and the Anti-Christ was elected to office.  The first wave seemed to be the hemophiliac kids whose neighbors, churches and schools made their last days a nightmare.  Then wave after wave of friends who would show up at happy hour with their diagnoses but otherwise looking fine.  They'd go on meds and be dead within months.  If they were lucky enough to have a partner the next few months was filled with nausea and diarrhea, night sweats and a slow and painful death followed by the dead
patient's family, most of whom had written off their gay sibling, coming to claim their loot often times leaving the partner in an empty home or on the street.  It is a memory of ACT-UP, a giant quilt, cancelled insurance plans.  Friends found hanging in their basement days after getting their diagnosis and funeral after funeral, sometimes two a day for about 10 years.  None of them had a nickel to join a buyers club though we heard they were starting up in places like NYC and SFO.  But ACT-UP took care of that and soon everyone could get a drug that had once been shelved for side effects and lack of efficacy but which soon became the most expensive drug ever produced.  And after Ryan White was terrorized by his friends, school and church Congress finally got the courage to pass the Ryan White Act which made those drugs available to everyone through State run plans.  Yes the drug companies made a fortune as did their investors.  We were the largest running experiment in the history of the world as millions of us signed up for every test, every med, any chance at a cure and we still died by the boatloads.

It is 30 years later and American still can't make a movie about the horror we experienced as a nation because the nation didn't experience it.  They left us to die or fight for our lives on our own and then got snippy because we were successful and jealous that our dying became a cause celebre.  I've lost dozens of close friends and many more dozens of acquaintences.  For us this movie doesn't show the face of AIDS in America, though as expected, the gay guy does die but the protagonist's death is told to us in white text on a black screen right before the credits roll.  One wonders who claimed the body.  But considering the movie is not called Cowboy with AIDS or AIDS in America the ultimate fate of the subject of the movie, the actual Dallas Buyers Club seemed like a footnote.  The same kind of footnote this movie made of the milions who weren't theoretically straight cowboys who learned to tolerate a drag queen/trans/whatever.  This film didn't even really dignify Leto's character with any real depth other than just another boy in a dress.

It must have been a tough roll for McC to play and for that he deserves an award.  Leto seemed a bit comfortable in his role which earned him an award.  But the Academy was smart in leaving it there because the fact is, as a movie, it just kind of sucked in so many ways and the more I think about it the more offensive it becomes.

But it's worth the watch even if it offends more than it uplifts.",1393891200,23,4712,4.341714285714286

6117689,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie goes deeply into how the FDA and pharmaceutical companies have rigged the system so that alternative forms of treatment are labeled as quackery, illegal or a variety of other labels to keep them off the market.  The main character, who is straight, is diagnosed with HIV and later AIDS.  With only 30 days to live, he goes through all of the usual emotions in a short time and then decides he must get his hands on any medication (legal or otherwise) that might keep him going.  The movie covers his journey to help himself and others who society tossed aside to fend for themselves.

Matthew McConaughey gives an oscar-winning performance and is nearly unrecognizable as he becomes increasingly thin, emaciated, tired, determined and frustrated.  Jared Leto also gives a stellar performance.  At first, I didn't even realize it was a man playing his role. Jennifer Garner is OK and doesn't add much to the movie.

I personally remember how during the 80's AIDS was considered a disease that the gay community brought on themselves and the stigma attached to it was wrong and caused many early and miserable deaths.  There was little incentive for the drug companies to develop drugs to help these very ill people, so it was years before HIV wasn't considered a death sentence.

This movie is based on a true character and even though the viewer knows the sad ending, you are constantly rooting for him to get a few more months before the inevitable.

If you think the FDA and drug companies are ethical and honest in their practices, this movie isn't for you.",1393891200,,1571,4.763837638376383

6117694,5,B00GUO3C3W,Some of the best movies are true stories and this one falls into that category.

6117745,4,B00GUO3C3W,"There are many nice, cinematic moments, but the film is not nearly as profound as it tries to be. Certainly it's very emotional, a touching story of a man's ups and downs dealing with HIV/AIDS back at the genesis of the disease in the '80s. But while the movie is great with the heart, it is lacking for the head. What is not communicated nor explored are the thoughts and logic of the various characters. The protagonist's transformation from jerk to nice guy is a little too facile, and likely more from selfish and personal gain than a learned kindness. So I found myself a bit confused as to why this man was say, mad, at certain points: Because he couldn't help himself or others? Lost money or chivalrous intentions? At some point he evolves from a completely bigoted homophobe, but I'm not sure when or even why.

The best parts of the movie involved the examination of how the American pharmaceutical corporation and medical research can conspire against the patients. Together they present some compelling and damning insight into how these industries affect those they're supposed to help.

This is ultimately a movie best for those with an active interest in the subject matter of early HIV research and activism, or those who enjoy redemptive tragedies.",1393804800,,1265,4.824884792626728

6117748,4,B00GUO3C3W,"In DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, Matthew McConaughey joins the big league of actors with the unique ability to become the characters they portray. McConaughey gives a stunning, gritty and bittersweet performance as a rather unsavory real-life person Ron Woodroof.
McConaughey won the Academt Award as Best Actor and few actors take such a risk in an unpredictable box-office movie. Slender McConaughey lost even more weight to portray the AIDS-stricken, gaunt Woodroof.
While we can praise his performance, there are a lot of negatives about DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. The film is long and slow-moving. Although Woodroof is real, transgender Rayon (Academy Award winner Jared Leto) was created to give the Woodroof character an ally and more dramatic interaction. We are taken back to the 80's when AIDS was an automatic death sentence with no treatment, let alone a cure. It became a ""gay"" disease and people out of both homophobia and legitimate fear were uncertain how easily AIDS could be contracted--a simple sneeze? A handshake? DALLAS BUYERS CLUB takes us back to this time as heterosexual Woodroof deals with his own homophobia and those of ""friends"" who assume he must be gay.
Woodroof starts the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB to get unapproved by potentially life-saving drugs to those afflicted by AIDS. Unfortunately, he is not crusading for the good of mankind but rather for his own needs. It all comes at a cost. It's $400 a month to join the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. Those who can't pay, can't get the medicines.  Although Woodroof softens a bit in his journey. He is never redeemed as he plays against the Law and the FDA. It never goes beyond the money he can earn from the club. He fights agains the harsh drug AZT because of the damage it does but at the time, it was the only approved treatment. As we learn later, a smaller dose of AZT combined with other drugs did provide an effective treatment-but not cure-for AIDS.
McConnaughey is amazing in his role and deserves to be applauded. It's clear he had his heart in this project and he finally can be added to the ranks of great dramatic actors.
There is a disappointment that the bonus features lack any information on the real Ron Woodroof. The bonus features are minimal and deal only with the making of the film. There is nothing to give historical context of this frightening time in the 80's.",1393804800,,2338,4.8159203980099505

This film represents practically nothing about the AIDS crisis, except dealing with ordinary bureaucratic red-tape stupidity.  The protagonist's bigotry is sickening.  The only reason this film was made was because its stars saw it as a definite vehicle to earn an Oscar. Lose 30 lbs for a role, and you're a shoo-in.  So many in Hollywood have stood up for AIDS causes, not one of the actors in this movie has done a thing.  Not a word.  Not a smile.

AIDS isn't any ordinary story.  It was genocide because of bigotry, ignorance and hate. I was there, I witnessed the whole thing.  People want to forget it, I want to forget it, but it happened, just like the Holocaust.

McConaughey is at his finest and he gives us all the slick charm his characters are known for and then something more - a side of his personality that Is genuine and more interesting than many of his film roles have allowed him to portray.

McConaughey's film character comes alive because it draws upon the actor's own courage as an artist. McConaughey took a great many risks to make this film when he chose to take up the subject of HIV/AIDS and open out the socio-economic as well as the medical challenges those infected with this disease wrestle with.

The script is excellent and tells the deeply moving story of how one man refuses to accept the status quo diagnosis for his health condition and makes it his business to help an entire socially-marginalized population persevere in the struggle to live and die with dignity despite the stigma surrounds them.",1393804800,,1113,4.72680412371134

Leto's portrayal of Rayon, a tragic trannie wannabe also afflicted, is straightforward, believable, and sympathetic; one of the first- perhaps the only- to be approached so simply and directly in film. At a dark and tragic moment in time, they work ""off the grid"" to provide themselves and other victims with an opportunity not just to survive but to hope for a future despite a medical system that shows little interest in their plight.

Jared Leto plays his cross-dressing business partner, Rayon, and does an excellent job as well. The storyline is based on the true story of a man who refuses to accept his fate when he is diagnosed with HIV and given 30 days to live. By bypassing The FDA's corporate interests and supporting regulations, he obtains medication that is more successful at treating his illness that AZTEC, which is the only authorized drug available in the US.

They were so outstanding that I want to watch it again. Jared was absolutely amazing with his character.

6117826,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The fact it supposedly took nearly twenty years to bring the true story of Ron Woodroof to the screen is a somber fact which has not muted its impact over time.  This heart wrenching chronicle of one mans desperate attempts against all odds features marvelous performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared  Leto.

It is 1985 in Dallas, Texas, and rodeo rider, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), has an accident and ends up in the hospital where he learns he has the HIV virus which causes AIDs, a death sentence which, according to his doctor, gives him thirty days to live and put his affairs in order.  Stunned by the news, which heretofore was a sexually transmitted disease among homosexuals, Ron learns the grim truth about AIDs, a growing global epidemic.  Whats worse is the lack of any effective treatment even as trials for the experimental drug AZT begin via the Food and Drug Administration.  Frustrated by ineffective drugs and running out of time, Ron takes matters in his own hands and begins to research the disease and travels to Mexico and other exotic locations for possible answers.  He tries drug and vitamin combinations, a kind of AIDs cocktail, and begins to sell these to others.  He even finds a way to circumvent the law forbidding his selling drugs by offering memberships.  Helped by a fellow AIDs patient, Rayon (Jared Leto), his clinic sees an explosion in membership as his cocktail gains in popularity.  As the FDA and the IRS attempt to shut down his operation, he wages a one man fight against the forces that would close his enterprise and a hope for AIDs patients.

It is interesting that the world has come a long way in the treatment and survivability of AIDs, but back then there were severely limited resources.  Also the stigma and intolerance of being gay was more pronounced.  Rons homophobic reactions evolve over time in a very convincing, realistic way, and he is affected and transformed to the point where he even takes on Rayon as an unlikely business partner and even friend.  That relationship, that unlikely pairing, is what makes the story fascinating and at times poignant.

That it took a deadly malady to give his a life purpose and definition is the supreme irony.  By no means a saint, he has casual sex partners when he isn't snorting cocaine or boozing it up, and when he isn't scamming a buck, utters a plethora of profanities when it suits him.  He is a survivor and hustler who proves his resourcefulness in obtaining his drugs and vitamins even resorting to disguises, schmoozing, and legal maneuvering.

McConaughey (Contact, The Lincoln Lawyer) lost as much as 47 pounds for this role to depict the AIDs ravaged survivor; its the role of a lifetime.  Leto (Requiem for a Dream) equally excels as the transvestite and drug addict who befriends Ron and provides a window into the world of gays and more potential clients.  Jennifer Garner registers a strong performance as a sympathetic doctor caught between treatment controversies.

You almost wish that the filmmakers (director Jean-Marc Valle and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) had expanded upon the machinations of the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies which held sway over life and death particularly in a standout scene near the end as Ron confronts the FDA in front of an audience.  But this is primarily an intimate portrayal of a rebel, one whose self discovery leads to remarkable action and a profound effect on many others.

You do wish some of the plotlines had been more developed.  For instance, Rons police friend, Tucker, has a scene with his elderly father involving a drug; it would have been nice to develop that subplot which figures later when Ron needs help in a sticky situation.

The film is a low budget production, but that enhances its realism.  A bittersweet story full of the charm and vigor that McConaughey brings to Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club lingers long after its closing credits as a testament of an imperfect person in an impossible situation who left a memorable mark.

The graphic depictions of Ron Woodruff's personal life are a reminder of how AIDS persisted and why.

Matthew McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance. He is rail thin and looks so frail that he is just a fraction of his normal self. I had to keep reminding myself that this is Matthew McConaughey  whom I'm watching because he looks nothing like himself and his range of acting in this film goes beyond anything he's ever done.

Jennifer Garner is bland and seems poorly cast (and excuse me for nitpicking, but why did the set designer put her in an apartment with modern-day granite countertops and stainless steel appliances when this film takes place in the 1980s?). But Jared Leto is anything but bland. Like McConaughey, he is very convincing in his role and has garnered an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for his performance as a cross-dressing AIDS victim who becomes Woodruff's business partner.

Even as the credits rolled we sat there, with tears streaming down our faces, quiet. You are immediately thrown back in time from the very beginning...being reminded of how ignorant many of us were about HIV/AIDS. The world has changed so much since then (thank God) but this story is an important one to tell. Although Ron starts out as someone you have a hard time liking, you find yourself totally engaged in his (and Rayon's) story and actually care about him in the end.

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

'The Dallas Buyers Club' is the first mainstream film that has the guts to question both the efficacy and legitimacy of Orthodox Medicine's early AIDS medication research as well as highlighting the unhealthy relationship between the researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, who pushed toxic treatments on an unsuspecting public. The man who led the valiant crusade against this nasty coterie of entrenched interests was the unlikely Texas electrician and part-time rodeo cowboy, Ron Woodroof (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaghey), who went from being a redneck homophobe to a tolerant, alternative health activist.

When we're first introduced to Woodroof, he's the epitome of what some may call 'Trailer Trash'. Woodroof pals around with his homophobic buddies, has sex with prostitutes and uses drugs like candy. After sustaining a work-related injury (he's zapped by a faulty electrical current), Woodroof's brought to the hospital to recover. The tests reveal that he's got AIDS and he's told he has 30 days to live. First Woodroof's in denial but remembers that he had unprotected sex with an intravenous drug user. As he researches causes of AIDS in the library, it dawns on him that his drug use in general probably was also a big factor leading to his illness. As we break into Act II, Woodruff's life is upended as he's ostracized by his community and must fend for himself as he seeks a cure.

When AZT first came out, the double blind experiments prevented subjects from knowing whether they were getting the real thing or a placebo. Woodroof is forced to bribe a hospital worker to obtain the drug but after using it for a short time, finds his health getting worse. When his supply at the hospital runs out, it's then that he hears about a doctor in Mexico, Vass, who might have some AZT. It turns out that Dr. Vass was barred from practicing in the US after giving his patients non- approved, alternative medications. It's this Dr. Vass who enlightens Woodroof about the dangers of AZT and how it's completely toxic. He gives him the protein, peptide T, along with some other non-toxic medication and Woodroof finds himself getting better. I'm not sure if the medication did the trick or it simply was the lack of flooding his body with toxic stuff like AZT that stabilized the very ill Woodroof, but whatever the case, this Dr. Vass was on to something.

After his health begins to improve, Woodroof gets the idea that he can make money by importing the alternative AIDS medications and selling them by subscription (Dallas Buyers Club members must pay $400 per month to get the medications); he smuggles them into the US dressed as a priest and claiming they're for his personal use. Earlier, Woodroof met a transsexual diagnosed with AIDS by the name of Rayon (Jared Leto) who he tries to avoid due to his homophobia. But after his own bout with the illness, Woodroof becomes more accepting of Rayon, who becomes his business partner, bringing in new clients from her contacts in the gay community.

'Dallas Buyers Club' is perhaps the first mainstream film that criticizes both allopathic medicine and big Pharma. When Dr. Sevard finds out about the buyer's club, he castigates Woodroof because his efforts are interfering with his AZT trials. It's obvious that in the doctor's view of things, only orthodox medicine has the right to grant access to treatment for AIDS sufferers. Worse is the attitude of the FDA in the form of point man Richard Barkley, who ends up confiscating Woodroof's medications and threatens to have him jailed. Later, Woodroof attempts to challenge the FDA's new rules which make it illegal to dispense alternative medications for AIDS sufferers. While Woodroof loses in Federal Court (the Judge sympathizes but argues that legally, his hands are tied), he emerges as a hero to the gay community along with progressive sympathizers.

Not everyone in the medical community views Woodroof as a demon. Gradually, Dr. Eve Saks comes around to his point of view. She's right however, when Woodroof gets angry over the fact that Rayon was taken to the hospital and given AZT while he was away. Dr. Saks tells Woodroof that ultimately Rayon died from her own drug usage and not from one or two days of AZT treatment. The idea that Woodroof would lash out like that is understandable given the fact that he had just learned of Rayon's death. But ultimately,Woodroof's blaming Rayon's death solely on AZT (especially for the short time she was administered the drug), was irrational.

If there is one sour note in the film, it's in one of the closing credits. We're informed that due to Woodroof's efforts, AZT was modified so that it was less toxic and millions of AIDS sufferers were saved. I hardly believe that Woodroof would have been happy with such a statement. The whole point of the film was that Woodruff was a crusader who fought for alternative medications and he himself lived longer, not because of toxic pharmaceutical products but because he took benign alternative ones--which perhaps gave his body a better chance than the kind of medicines touted by mainstream physicians and their government minions.

In the end, even Woodroof's alternative medications were not enough to prevent him from dying of AIDS. But he lived seven years longer than his initial diagnosis of 30 days. 'Dallas Buyers Club' not only bravely holds up a mirror to a medical establishment that has for too long been given a free pass in regards to increased scrutiny but it's also a perceptive tale of a man who transformed himself from a bigot and self-centered materialist to a compassionate healer with a moral and humanitarian core.",1393372800,,5743,4.94300518134715

6117909,4,B00GUO3C3W,"This drama about a man's struggle to get proper care - or to manufacture care for himself - in the early days of AIDS in the 1980s is worth seeing for the outstanding performances of Jared Leto (as a pre-operative transsexual with AIDS) and Matthew MacConaughey (as the heterosexual who practiced unsafe sex with the wrong woman, apparently).  The story brings to life the tragedy of the plague of AIDS hitting the world, before we knew much about it, before we had any known medical treatment (and before the stigma of being sexually transmitted and associated with homosexuality was addressed).

As a movie -- meh. The FDA and Big Pharma, while historically they were not heroic in this situation -- the movie portrays them as two-dimensional, active evil-doers.  There is not much of a plot, there's little narrative arc.  MacConaughey's character moves from a rampant homophobic to a gay's best friend rather abruptly, although the actors do what they can to show more real and gradual understanding building between them.  Jennifer Garner is competent in playing the typical Hollywood pursed-lip, smart, supportive woman's role.",1393372800,,1133,5.135869565217392

It was very informative in that the plot revolved around AIDS in the late 80's when very little was known about it other than only homosexuals or ""junkies"" could become infected with this deadly virus. The FDA and their NOT approving a drug that could definitely help the infected people was the main premise of the plot. MM flies the world over trying to find this drug and when he does, must smuggle it into the US to help others in his same plight.

6117916,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I give Dallas buyers club the rating of 5 stars specifically for the acting effort of Mathew McConaughy!  Mathew applies himself to fill the role of real life electrician and rodeo habitue' Ron Woodruff, who is told by doctors  that he has AIDS, and only 30 days left to live! McConaughy's performance is absolutely the most impressive of his career! In the scene where he violently reacts to the diagnosis of being HIV positive,  and storms out of the hospital is one of the most intense of the entire film!  McConaughy soon realizes the diagnosis is all to real as he begins to feel the effects of his failing health. Not only is his health failing, he also has to deal with the harsh rejection of friends who learn about his AIDS problem and quickly shut him out. leaving him feeling more and more alone.
returning to the hospital, he is given some drugs for treatment and relief and quicly learns that not only are those drugs  inadequate, but so are the doctors who are treating him!  He begins to do his own research on some of the better drugs being used to treat patients with AIDS  in other country's, but not approved by the FDA in the USA!  So he decides to start smuggling the drugs in and begins selling them to other patients who otherwise would never get them. The doctors learn of this and soon Mcconaughy finds the FDA at his doorstep seizing his drugs and stopping his operation. Refusing to bend to the corruption of the FDA or the government he continues to locate the drugs that will ease the suffering and prolong his life and the lifes of those seeking the drugs from him. All throughout the film we follow McConaughy deeper and deeper into the world of those infected with HIV,how it effects their families and friends, not to mention the surrounding world of health care providers, hospitals, doctors, nurses and the seemingly endless problems that abound from every direction because of it.

6117924,4,B00GUO3C3W,"As a young actor, Matthew McConaughey was only really known for his frequent appearances in romantic comedies. He was great in things like ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends' Past"", but he wasn't really taking on challenging and diverse roles like he does today. However, he is quickly becoming one of the best dramatic actors working and has managed to surprise me in a number of movies like ""Mud"" and ""Bernie"". After losing a ton of weight, and transforming himself into his latest character, he surprised me once again with his outstanding performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"".

The new drama follows the true-story of Ron Woodroof (McConaughey), a gambling bull-rider that is abruptly diagnosed with HIV. Unable to receive the proper treatment he needs in America, he resorts to non-approved medication that he finds on a trip to Mexico. Importing the drugs to sell in Dallas, his mission is to help others that are in the same predicament. Teaming up with Rayon (Jared Leto), a flamboyant transvestite, they form what they call the Dallas Buyers Club.

 It's bleak and often depressing, but you really feel for the lead characters. McConaughey and Leto totally deserve all the praise they've been getting, and keep you watching through some of the sadder moments. It's more of a character piece than anything else, and isn't totally perfect, but it's worth seeing for them alone. Rated R for language and sexual content, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is excellently acted and interesting from the start.",1393286400,,1512,5.06425702811245
6117925,5,B00GUO3C3W,"After reading many reviews (both good and bad) I felt I should add my opinion for what it's worth. You may go into this film thinking ""Matthew McConaughey.....all right all right all right"". Try for a moment to ignore who the actors are, because they do an AMAZING job to help you forget. Both McConaughey and Leto are so deserving of the praise they have received. For the many reviews I read about the vulgarity of this film please be aware that this is a portrayal of a few troubled souls. If you don't want to watch movies with sex, violence, and vulgar language then I urge you to stop watching movies with that big R on the box. You did have a choice, quit reviewing movies that you should have known were going to offend you.",1393286400,,732,4.350364963503649

6117927,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughay shines in this darkly poignant film about the early AIDS crisis. But the film speaks a universal language that transcends AIDS: this could be any disease whose control lies beyond current therapy. It touches on the issues of lack of health insurance, lack of access to decent medicine, the impotency of government and bureaucracy in the face of medical crises, and the lack of compassion in our society for the sick and dying, particularly when moralistic judgements are attached to health conditions.",1393286400,,521,5.214285714285714

6117933,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This has been on the New Release list for a while now and I kept passing it by, just because I did not see from the movie description how it could play out as anything other than another sad story about Aids.  McConaughey was excellent and Jennifer played her role to subtle perfection.  However, the story was amazing to watch play out and brought issues to my attention that I never considered before not just with that terrible disease but others as well.  I have a habit of keeping my IPad on my lap to fact check during all movies that are ""based"" on true stories.  I really did not want to do that with this one.  I am and was perfectly fine enjoying the movie and appreciating the story told completely as is, without googling through every scene!",1393286400,,754,4.39568345323741

If it wasn't for the fact that this was a true story, I would say that the rawness of the story line, lots of naked bodies and the life this person lead all would have had me turning this off within 10 minutes.  The true story makes it more fascinating, but less appealing to view degenerates in all phases of life.  Matthew McConaughey does play a great role, though.",1393200000,,484,4.415730337078652

6118021,2,B00GUO3C3W,I don't understand why Hollywood feels that crude language and crude sex scenes are necessary to tell a story. The story would have been much more uplifting if it could have been told without the weight of being so crude.

6118023,4,B00GUO3C3W,The acting was amazing and the transformations required of the actors for these particular roles were really something amazing.  This film was really bleak and gritty but it gives you a sense of the time that it was made and it being only 20 years ago what HIV patients were going through was really incredible to get proper treatment or even fair treatment.  McConaughey's character was really inventive and super persistent and he wanted to live.  He wasn't a terribly likable protagonist but his willingness to fight was really incredible. I kept having to tell myself this is the late 80's because so much of it was harsh and unbelievable.  The only reason I gave it 4.5 stars is that it doesn't have much rewatchability.

6118029,3,B00GUO3C3W,"simply, and a big IF, by chance.

Matthew McConaughey gives a solid, quite engaging performance. I have no way to make an analogy since I had never seen him  acting, but the little I hear is that he lost a lot of weight for this role, but you will barely see the results unless you have a clear portrait of him as the stud that he has been in the past------a totally RIPPED body.
But if you don't, then he appears quite normal during most of the movie, makeup taking care of the ""facial wasting"" that consumes an Aids patient's face towards the final stage-----indeed,for years before in so many cases.
That does not help the movie. But, gladly, it does nothing to detract from what is a very confident portrayal of this, as I stated before, in exact level of importance:
1-LOWLIFE
2-HUSTLER
3-Aids patient
4-""activist"" by serendipity.

Perhaps this is where the movie faces its greatest, most intractable problem of trust.
The character has been a hustler all his life, just about,it would seem, and in desperation starts to find ways in which to get some of the substances that are being tried through studies in which, alas, yet inevitably, you have some of those in a trial taking nothing but a pill of sugar, say.
This problem did not end with Aids, but arguably it was the Aids community and its most ardent Activists (""ACT UP"", for example) that brought the issue to the fore------and fighting the FDA again and again, was able to finally win the battle and have many of these trials, whatever degree of positive signs of control over the virus with a substance, let it be released to a fast-dying population. The matter, again,is still in contention with some Aids drugs, but even more so with Cancer drugs that may increase your lifespan by perhaps a year.
The film offers us a relative indictment against the FDA, that carries too much weight for me to contend right here in a most methodical way, but let us just say that a deeply complex issue is reduced to a simplistic, perhaps even homophobic fight which confuses and distorts the issue at hand in a way that is irresponsible for the filmmaker.
One has to wonder what can a young audience take away from this movies' management of such a sensitive issue when such complexity is rendered so cynically and thinly.
The protagonist, as I said before, is no activist working for a cause-------or even for HIS cause. While at first you see the desperation that impending death brings to his behaviour, soon you can see that in true hustlers' manner this sham of a human being goes on to try to establish a so-called ""Buyers' club"" (as with Marijuana in the past 10 years or so, again, set up by Aids patients, yet used MANY TIMES as a front for anyone wanting to buy great pot-----this writer having been a not too amused observer).
It cannot be stated with enough passion the PHONINESS of his ""large-scale"" endeavor,what with going to Japan, Mexico, setting post at a motel where, yes, you can get the drugs (AZT, primarily, it would seem) for FREE, BUT the monthly membership is $500.00........
This is all presented in such a silly, haphazard way that no intelligent person would buy into this. Yet, one of the lures of the film is that it is a ""true story"". Well, it may all have happened, but it comes across as a complete sham since the man, we have come to confidently believe, can barely get through a conversation without a curse, less so flying to Japan to shop for medications.
This repulsive ""dude"", one could exaggerate, make us all go ""right-wing"" and think that after all, you deserve anything you get.
The film's irresponsible way to ""celebrate"" this man as an example of all those with the GUTS, the nerve, the heart-breaking act of fighting the government (mind you, many of these having been Heterosexual persons, not gay) is perplexing, no more than at the end when a group awaits his arrival to thank him for his ""success"".
Whatever CONCRETE success is never entirely clear, but we can be confident, TOTALLY so, that this man wasn't doing this for anyone but himself.

We should perhaps remember this film for having the most despicable example of an Aids patient out there, and come to think of it, such a thought must be accompanied by the fact that he isn't gay,as generally has been the case with films depicting Aids patients, but a poor, dispossessed, white trash STRAIGHT IV user.
The creators of this ""spectacle"" had the chance of offering us the opportunity to find a heterosexual IV user with Aids,one with a few more bits of humanity in him, and yet we are left with one more caricature of the IV user as little more than a con artist, self-absorbed  and repulsive.",1393113600,,4656,4.6251511487303505

However, if you hate downers after seeing this movie you may want some anti-depressants.  It shows a fighting spirit that pays off and ultimately helps all of those inflicted sadly with HIV AIDS.

We must infer these human bonds based on the fact that we see McConaughey's character evolving toward greater compassion and selflessness throughout the film.

I would expect this film to be a real tearjerker but I was unmoved due to the failure of the production team to delve deep into the relationships that would have been the catalyst for McConaughey's transformation from a coked up cowboy to a generous and fierce fighter for human rights with a preternatural will to live.

6118084,4,B00GUO3C3W,"I expected much less than I got in this movie. I had read about the outstanding performances of Matthew McConaghey and Jared Leto so I thought I would check it out.  What I got was a stunning story of rebellion against the medical and regulatory establishment which was caught up in a holy war of ""we are right and we are not going to give an inch"" against the plague that was HIV and AIDS in the 80s and 90s. The passion and anger that McConaghey brings to the character of Ron Woodruff is palpable as he confronts those who refuse to respond to the situation in which thousands of people echo his words ""I'm DYING.""  But this character does more than complain. He gets smart and becomes a rebel with a cause. He does everything imaginable to challenge, subvert, and outsmart the bullies who ofer no solutions and no comfort to the dying.
This movie is the story of his journey from a brash, bigoted con man to a brash, accepting, and committed con man who will do anything to get medicine and some hope for those similarly afflicted. He became a one man ACT UP movement. Jared Leto, in an amazing transformation of gender and sexual identity,  personifies the plight of outcasts who are swept along on his mad journey. Jennifer Garner is the one doctor who sympathetically questions and finally rejects the medical community's stubborn refusal to adapt to a grim reality.
The outcome of the characters is never in doubt in the days before the cocktail of medicines restored hope to millions. But the good fight was worthwhile and eventually brought changes in how people are treated medically and humanly.",1392940800,,1607,4.651408450704225

It showed what men and women had to do in order to stay healthy and not be a victim of the AZT drug which at the time was toxic. McConaughey was amazing in this character and made the audience feel all the emotions Ron went through. As serious as the subject is, Rayon played by Jared Leto, bought a light hearted piece to the movie and watching the two of them form a relationship was beautiful.",1392854400,,479,4.217391304347826

In depth characterization by all leading actors is beyond belief in this film. The pace is fast, complex and intriguing.

A new facet of the wide open spaces is revealed. The American west generally thought of as pristine, wide open and full of good clean adventure, becomes a deeply dark place of desperation. From that ""nothing to lose"" place, one American cowboy finds a reason to live by helping those closest to him.

I did not know what the movie was all about, but it definitely had a strong argument towards the pharmeceutical industry, and how they basically dictate the rules for this immense wealthy industry. The movie is actually very good, minor complaints about the video quality in some moments, but mostly the sound was was below par. I guess that the first company that solves the puzzle of superior sound will have the loyalty of the masses, for unless you own a sound bar or additional equipment, some times is darn hard to listen.

McConaughey's range of emotions, acting keep surprising us and his loss of weight for this role -- astounding.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner also superb in their supporting roles.  Director Jean-Marc Vallee hits all the right chords to make this story pulsate in your veins, mind and heart.  Great editing as well.  One statistical addition would be good to see -- how many people are there now living (and working) who are HIV positive or AIDS identified.  It's no longer a death sentence....22 years and running for Magic Johnson...we hope it continues to become an easier treatable condition (like diabetes) so people can still live long, productive lives with it.  Oh, and we hope the Academy finally recognizes the talent of McConaughey -- whose range of characters and willingness to throw himself ""dirty sweat"" deep into a myriad of roles is astounding.  This is why we watch films -- to see real life poured onto us and just soak it in as if we are there with the actors.  Bravo. :  )",1392681600,,1547,5.103174603174603

Second, the movie itself contains all the right elements of a great movie: a compelling, true story, excellent cinematography, a strong script, and excellent acting. And it covers a very serious topic very relevant to my era in a way that made me see and understand it as never before.

The challenges in getting treatment and unknown futures they faced.  The obvious stigma of that testing positive in that Era had and how the medical community, US Government and Friends of the characters negatively reacted at that time.

It's a beautiful story of a Texan cowboy who slept around a lot in his day and did so unprotected. He's totally homophobic so when he finds out he has HIV, that's one of the reasons he freaks out. In his mind, only gay guys get infected. Anyway, after poisoning his body with high doses of a new FDA-approved drug, alcohol and coke, his body gives way. Soon, he decides to use natural remedies and take care of himself. He meets Jared Leto's character Rayon and the two start a Buyer's Club with the latter's connections to the HIV-infected homosexual community in order to give people better and more natural medicines than the poison hospitals backed by the FDA was pumping into patients.

Their access to AZT and other potentially life-saving drugs was so limited, so they frequently turned to supplements from around the world. This movie tells that tale. Mathew McConaughey starts off as skeletal and becomes more so. Is this acting or extreme dieting? The latter but, having said that, he is very effective as a straight, electrician living in Texas -- hardly the most liberal of states to begin with. Jared Leto portrays a very sad transvestite who is addicted to drugs and sex.

6118227,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey is so impressive in this role as a hard living, womanizing rodeo rider who finds out he has AIDS.  The diagnosis forces him to re-evaluate his life choices and to befriend people that he would normally have contempt for.  When traditional medicine fails him, he turns to experimental options that are illegal in the US but can be obtained in other countries.  The Buyer's Club is formed so that he can go to where the drugs area available and bring them back to the US for other people like himself.  McConaughey is almost unrecognizable due to an approximately 50 pound weight loss.  He looks weak, frail and like he could be near death. His performance is as impressive as his physical transformation.  For me, however, Jared Leto steals the show with his portrayal of Rayon, a transgender prostitute who is also suffering from AIDS.  He is amazing in the role.  The two disparate people end up joining forces.  This movie is as much about the FDA and drug companies as it is about the people.  What's amazing is that here we are 20 plus years since this true story took place and little progress has been made in the drug approval process.  I would definitely recommend this movie but it's not for anyone younger than say 15 or 16.",1392595200,,1254,4.6289592760181

Sad but great Movie about someone that decides not to follow the advise of our corrupt medical system and decides to get real help but has to go to other countries of course because the FDA does not approve of the real medicines.",1392595200,,443,4.188235294117647

Every single cast member was excellent in portraying their character and the story of the Buyer's Club was intriguing to me because I'd never heard of Ron Woodroof before the buzz started about this movie. Having grown up in the south during the 80's all I encountered of AIDS was taboo and a death sentence. I wish I had known about this rebel who was taking his diagnosis, not unlike a bull by the horns, and finding his own treatment and medicines which probably kept him alive much longer than any other conventional AIDS treatment at the time. I can't recommend this film highly enough to anyone.",1392508800,,764,4.503597122302159

Not a bad thing in this day and age when everyone seems polarized. I don't know who else could have played this role with such understanding and forcefulness. I am a McConaughey fan totally and was not let down by his stellar performance. I think the director took a few liberties with the plot and the circumstances but it is still a gripping tale that held me spellbound. Hopefully, McConoughey will win the Oscar for his work. As an aside, the music track is perfect for the film. It underscores the drama without being intrusive, maudlin, or kitchy as some films do when portraying an earlier decade. Do check it out.

6118282,5,B00GUO3C3W,"If you don't know in advance where it's going, this movie comes at you out of nowhere. An irresponsible, asocial, goodtiming redneck cowboy turns himself into an opportunistic entrepreneur who seems to be preying on some of the weakest among us, and gradually becomes an activist with a social conscience. But McConaughey's performance is so subtle (a strange word to apply to his depiction of a man who starts off as a complete and utter jerk), you don't realize his selfishness is being transmuted into something altogether different. This film won't win the Best Oscar, but it should be in contention; and McConaughey should win Best Actor, hands down. Jared Leto's supporting performance matches McConaughey's.",1392508800,,714,5.217391304347826

Great story.  And, it helped me learn more about what was happening at the time, in addition to what I experienced.  Although I'm not gay, I lost friends both gay and straight.

I could not believe the transformation, especially in Mathew and Jared and that this movie is a really good eye opener if you are willing to really look.

6118293,1,B00GUO3C3W,We watched very little of this movie.  It was nothing but trash and vulgar.  What a waste of money.  I was embarrassed to have rented it.  The trailer didn't show a true representation of the what it was.,1392422400,5,204,4.2894736842105265
6118294,5,B00GUO3C3W,"It seemed to be a whole different world in the eighties.  Presidential elections, foreign policy issues have gone awry, the war on drugs, ""Just say no"", then along with this unrest was the counterbalance of a false lulling of stability, which was easy to be secure in. Then HIV-AIDS hit like a hurricane, leaving us all baffled, unaware and totally perplexed.  Especially for the subject, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), who is a hard playing Texas rodeo man, a good old boy along with his other rough living friends.  A drug user and womanizer, he set the precedence of how we were still quite unaware and ignorant of how one would acquire HIV at the time.  Upon reaching 1985, by the time of his diagnosis, Ron starts to fight his prognosis; which is,

You've got 30 days to live.  Get your affairs in order.

He begins to learn all different ways that the medicine companies do, more so do not, work with the doctors and patients to help find the cure for this awful disease.  Ron learns that the side-effects are more deadly than most anything else and that the real medicines to help cannot be gotten here in the U.S.  They are labeled unapproved although not illegal.  This puts anybody in the middle of a paradox where life-sustaining medicines cannot be gained merely because of testing technicalities and a great lack of supportive funding to back it.

While Ron returns to the hospital to inquire about AZT and how to gain more of this medicine, he meets up with the compassionate and sympathetic doctor who was there during his diagnosis, Eve (Jennifer Garner). While she is informing him that there are still no procedures available, none similar to the AZT trials.  No matter how hard Ron is trying to find ways around these, each of his ideas is thwarted. A man is observing the conversation across the hall from them, Rayon (Jared Leto), who is a homosexual man and a transvestite with HIV himself.  He too is looking for help, extremely ill and not receiving anything real.

During such trauma with these two men and a huge dichotomy in his Law Enforcement brother, Tucker (Steve Zahn), the sufferings of everyone are even more apparent. Ron starts believing they could be helpful to one another, Rayon and himself, so they begin the ""Dallas Buyers Club"".  It takes time for the Ron and Rayon to achieve their success,  Ron has to overcome his own homophobic tendencies concerning Rayon.  With all the emotion of a human tragedy, this story plays out at every angle and in every way with an overwhelming amount of desperation in Ron and their members.

The complete standout of this 'based on a true story' movie is its character portrayals.  They are more than stellar when considering each McConaughey and Leto dropped an estimated forty pounds off of their already slim bodies.  They appeared emaciated, gaunt and vaguely skeletal, offering this terrifying state from the very start. It shocked me to see this and the unrecognizable Jared Leto.  If I didn't already know he was in this movie ahead of viewing, I would not have guessed it.

Jean-Marc Vallee directs this American horror story in a linear fashion. Without veering off into subplots to take the focus off of the outstanding pain, the central characters are experiencing.  The cinematographer (Yves Belanger) does a wonderful, if not masterful, job showing in exquisite detail every emotion to be felt. The scene concerning Woodroof in the single lit, very darkened room with a bevy of butterflies is superlative in every way.  Belanger captures the emotion of being so alone while being so surrounded in a single moment.  Surrounded also by what could potentially save his life, but no way to capture it is palpably horrific in its full understanding.  The camera work in this movie is very nuanced and doesn't miss the small things, the things you want, more so, have to see that capture a person, feeling, or an emotion. The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is an extremely dark thematic movie that sheds light onto a time that we couldn't fully understand yet.  All we knew of the time was we could feel it. Feel totally helpless during it, feel it horrifically and this is exactly what the movie delivers.",1392422400,7,4184,4.79108635097493

6118298,4,B00GUO3C3W,This is a good movie. I didn't think I'd like it since it's about an AIDs patient and I don't like stories of people who have contracted a disease and are dying. But it's not a sad movie because McConaughey's character refuses to accept his fate and that alone gives him the energy to ignore conventional medicine in favor of other drugs and to continue his life on his terms. What really makes this movie work though is McConaughey himself who gives an outstanding performence.,1392422400,,478,4.635294117647059

The film is brilliant in both it's honesty and subtleness; the social climate surrounding the infancy of the AIDS crisis is portrayed in this film as it truly was--with fear and shame and prejudice. I commend everyone involved with this film for tackling such a tough subject with the clear presence of mind to look at a panoramic subject with many points of view inside a emotional landscape. I wish there was some more info and pictures of the real Ron Woodroof & Rayon at the close of the film,  but even without that I did my own research on the people and learned more and had further insight about the films subject matter so thank you for compelling me to that!

But unfortunately I didn't enjoy the movie overall as much as I had hoped I would given the extraordinary true story of Ronald Woodroof.  The plot dragged a bit in places and lost a bit of the inspirational tone I think could have been achieved especially for those of us struggling with chronic diseases now without any ""real"" treatments.

6118335,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This movies showss a point of view of the Early AIDS epidemic we don't often see. People who were not just tragic victims of the disease, but who actually fought for their lives. They fought an indifferent government, a medical system slow to change, an often corrupt system and the vitriol of a fearful public.
Matthew McConaughey transforms himself not only physically, but emotionally to play an unlikely hero of the epidemic. Ron Woodruff is an electrician, sometimes rodeo cowboy, and ladies man who is nothing if not vehemently anti-gay in his viewpoint. In an accident at work,it his discovered that he is HIV positive, an absolute death sentence in those early days, he is given only thirty days to live. He soon goes about getting and taking the new drug AZT illegally when he can't get into a clinical trial. The drug along with his rampant alchohol and drug use, almost poison him to death and he eventually goes in search of promising new drugs only available in Mexico. He soon starts selling these drugs to other patients in need but the FDA and corrupt drug companies battle him seemingly every step of the way.
In the hospital Ron meets Rayon a street smart transvestite who is played  brilliantly by Jared a It's Leto who I think, I think, steals the show. It is partly through Rayon that Ron reluctantly grows more tolerant of the gay community he now serves. They become extremely close by the films end. Another standout is Jennifer Gardner who plays a doctor conducting the AZT trials. She comes to believe, as Ron does, that the massive doses of AZT are actually poisonous  but that is going against the medical community's beliefs and eventually her principles cost her her job. This film is based on a compelling real-life story and others like it and it is stellar performances by the actors that really bring it to life.",1392422400,,1846,4.729813664596273

The well written script has liberally added fictionalized characters and situations (both the characters played by Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner are supposedly fictional), but gets the message across beautifully. The transformation of Woodruff from a homophobic bigot to a genuine man of character, is well depicted. The acting is exceptional and both Mc Connaughey and Leto deserve Oscars.

6118342,3,B00GUO3C3W,The story was remarkable in that it was original because it was a true story. The sample of the human courage and strength when faced with overwhelming circumstances was truly impressive. The thing that made the film less than 5 star material was the over use of profanity.

The true emotion, depth, and physical involvement he provided is nothing short of Oscar quality Best Actor. McConaughey magnificently portrayed the strength, courage, and compassion needed by someone clinging to life while actively living life. The supporting actors, directing, and screenplay were near perfect as well, and also deserve all awards they receive. The sound track was well done and follows the situational emotion appropriately.

The struggle against big pharmaceuticals, Government hypocrisy, and society in general were accurately portrayed, and emotionally executed without invoking pity. The film subject and concept had the ability to be unbelievable and sappy, however the screenplay, directing, and acting took the film the other direction and focused on the courage and strength shown by the true story of Ron Woodroof.

But, regarding this movie, Matthew McConaughey is amazing along with Jared Leto.  Matthew McConaughey's character finds out that he is HIV positive.  This is back when there were still a lot of stereotypes given to AIDS patients.  And this is when there were studies for medications but lacking FDA approval.  So, after a trip to Mexico, he finds a pretty good cocktail of medicines and his health has improved.  He brings the medicine over the border and encounters all sorts of troubles.

If I didn't know Jared Leto was in this movie before I watched it, I would have never guessed that the character he played was even him.

6118384,5,B00GUO3C3W,At first I couldn't stand McConaughey's character.  By the end of the film the growth this individual went through turned him into an unlikely hero.  Who'd a thunk Jared Leto could play a transvestite so well?!?  All in all a really great slice of history.  This was a time I remember so well.  I was rather young during the time frame this movie was made and this disease showed up out of no where and had us all fearing the end was nigh'.  So much misinformation and fear.

People have so much more potential than to live lives obsessed with temporal sensuality...  It's like a body that is dying because it is in need of nutriants, but all the soul in charge will give it is a quick fix of M&Ms, over and over again....  You call that living?  That's why these lives are lived so intensly, and utterly, unsatisfied throughout their entire short days on this earth...

Matthew gives the performance of a livetime and Jared is amazing.  Not once did i think of Rayon as a ""he"" but instead fell in love with this beautiful, caring, gentle creature Jared created.

I think the reason the movie had to grow on me was that is was hard to accept what a genuine and realistic part Matthew was playing.  My head couldn't immediately accept him in the role.  Once I got over it, I could appreciate his part and the overall plot of the movie.  The plot and characters are real and complicated.  Such is life.",1392249600,,497,4.168421052631579

But the guy is one of the best actors I have ever seen, and I become more of a fan with each movie I dare to watch.  His role as Ron Woodruff in The Dallas Buyer's Club personifies the struggle of a real person condemned to die from contracting HIV in the mid-eighties, when AIDS first became a national epidemic.  Watching his portrayal of Woodruff's dogged determination to live, while finding ways to overcome ""persecution"" from the FDA, former friends, and society in general captures the true essence of the triumph of the human spirit.  Jared Leto's role as Rayon and the unexpected friendship with Woodruff is brilliant and heartbreaking.

6118431,5,B00GUO3C3W,Excellent performances by McConaughy and Leto. For me the story needed to settle in before I felt the full impact. It delves into the attitudes people had in the 80s about AIDS and looks at FDA interference that still exist today.,1392163200,,230,4.634146341463414
6118432,4,B00GUO3C3W,McConaughey as always is superb! an interesting look at the early AIDS crisis and the Pharmaceutical companies. Hard to call it an enjoyable movei but very thought provoking.,1392163200,,174,5.25
6118433,5,B00GUO3C3W,It's unreal how Matthew McConaughey changed his body for this part.  Putting his health at risk is pretty crazy to me in order to make a movie like this.  Good movie and I highly recommend it.,1392163200,,192,4.305555555555555
6118434,5,B00GUO3C3W,Great movie - a testament to the human spirit!

6118443,4,B00GUO3C3W,This movie told a very interesting story in a personal and heartfelt way.  Mc Conaughey did a superb acting job and definitely deserves an Oscar.  Jared Leto held his own as well and equally deserves an Oscar.  Maybe because of the script or editing it felt a little rushed and I wish they told more about the character's process in creating the club.  It made him come across like a greedy guy showing a lot of scenes of him accepting large sums of cash but didn't show very much about his personal reasons for creating and keeping the club going.

6118445,4,B00GUO3C3W,I gave it 4 stars and not five because of the graphic sex and colorful language.  The story is targeting the big pharmacy control of our country and how they use patients as guinea pigs to promote their drugs at the expense of the patients life.  Matthew M. does an amazing job of acting and is hardly recognizable with the weight loss to portray an hiv patient.  Loved how he came against the system to help people...very good story,1392163200,,433,4.455696202531645

6118447,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Matthew McConaughey and a wildly talented supporting cast, including Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, offer up performances of a lifetime in this poignant film. Based on the true story, McConaughey portrays a devil-may-care Texan who contracts HIV. When his salty character consults a doctor (Jennifer Garner) regarding his terminal diagnosis, he discovers the drug he needs is not yet approved by the FDA. Never one to walk away from a fight, McConaughey vows to retaliate. What follows is a character transformation of epic proportion.

There are scenes that some viewers may find hard to watch, as no emotion is left untouched in this film. However, I did not regard them as excessive or gratuitous. To the contrary, these scenes, often shot in close-ups, sharpened the focus of the film.",1392163200,,790,5.124031007751938

6118450,3,B00GUO3C3W,"We liked the movie and thought it had great promise, but it seemed to get confused and lose focus toward the end.

6118452,4,B00GUO3C3W,"With Matthew McConaughey's excellent portrayal of a homophobic rodeo enthusiast who contracts AIDS, he has shown another side of his acting that should qualify him as an early contender for a Best Actor nod. The length he went to in losing weight to what seems like a dangerous point (and Jared Leto did as well) shows a willingness to portray a reality rarely seen (calls to mind Robert Deniros weight gain in Raging Bull or Vincent D'nofrios weight gain for Full Metal Jacket). These guys are serious about their craft and discipline in how far they go to be convincing. As for the subject matter, it is a depressive situation faced by too many and might make some cringe, but that is one of many societal issues that the recent and modern world decides to either deal with or sweep under the rug. The attitudes of the FDA and AMA showed a tendency at the beginning of the movie to lag behind the problem as is usually the case when dealing with pandemics. Whatever your opinion, this is a strong movie and McConaughey manages to carry the weight of the issues very well.",1392163200,,1073,4.564766839378239

6118456,5,B00GUO3C3W,Excellent movie. Excellent cast. Matthew McConaughey kills it in the role of Ron Woodroof a hustler who finds out he is HIV+. Ron discovers the  difficulties of getting medications and learns that the ones available may not be helping. Definitely worth watching.,1392163200,,262,5.238095238095238

6118460,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This film is gritty and dirty and down where people (sadly) live. But it raises important questions about how medication should be handled for sick people. It is after all big business and ""the fix is always in"" when money gets involved. It is pretty sad that this guy had to go to Mexico to get better treatment!!! I think Matthew deserves an Oscar and the whole cast was very convincing... Excellent film, but not for the faint hearted...",1392163200,,440,4.582278481012659

6118462,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Set in the mid-1980s, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB focuses on the life of Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), who imports the medicine that fellow AIDS victims need, while circumventing the official system in the process. What sets Jean-Marc Valle's film apart is its refusal to sentimentalize the material: in McConaughey's performance he comes across as both homophobic and insecure. Even though he forms a close relationship with cross-dresser Rayon (Jared Leto), it's clear that he views homosexuality as somehow deviant. On the other hand, once he has been diagnosed with AIDS, Woodroof is ostracized by his fellow-Texan drinking buddies, who accuse him of being gay. We may admire Woodroof's ingenuity, as he exploits the system to procure supplies of drugs for his buyer's club, but we remain unsure as to his motives; is he performing a service or simply proving to himself that he can defy the doctors' prognosis that he has only 30 days to life? Or both. The film is deliberately shot in washed-out colors; this is a dark, subterranean world of seedy bars and ascetic hospital wards, where AIDS sufferers try to cope with the trauma of living with the disease, while being exploited by doctors such as Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare), who are more interested in profit motives than patient welfare. McConaughey and Leto are simply outstanding. Both of them had to lose considerable amounts of weight for their roles; their performances - especially as AIDS wreaks its ravages on them - are both understated yet intensely affecting. Definitely worth an Oscar or two, hopefully.",1392163200,,1570,5.11284046692607

6118472,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Not much to say that others haven't praised! It was fantastic acting, I believe that these are very honest portrayals of how some could respond to being told they have HIV, especially when so little was understood.

6118478,4,B00GUO3C3W,The movie does a good job of presenting how the AIDS epidemic was handled at the beginning of its discovery. It does tend to bog down a little in the middle of the movie though. Matthew McConaughy does an excellent job in his portrayal of the main character.,1392076800,,258,4.395833333333333
6118479,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This is really well-done, and it's a rare movie that my husband and I both actually liked, so that's saying something! Matthew McConaughey is almost unrecognizable in his role as a heterosexual cowboy who contracts AIDS in the still fairly early days of the epidemic (based on a real story.) Shunned by friends, and told he has a month to live, he researches his own alternative treatments, turns selling them in to a business, and ends up influencing the direction of AIDS treatment and research in his own way. Jennifer Garner is solid as a sympathetic doctor, and Jared Leto is brilliant as a transvestite fellow AIDS victim. It manages to be tragic, funny, gritty, and inspiring all at the same time. What more could you ask for?",1392076800,,733,4.734375
6118480,5,B00GUO3C3W,Buyer's Club exposes the lucrative politics of bringing prescription drugs to market in the USA.  McConaughey's performance  excels in this movie,1392076800,,145,5.857142857142857

6118482,5,B00GUO3C3W,It must have been sheer hell to be diagnosed with HIV back in the 80's. This movie was very sad . Don't get me wrong it was a very good movie and I would recommend it .,1392076800,,168,3.5675675675675675
6118483,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting is superb, and the story is worthy of the performances.  I knocked off a star because it drags a little about two-thirds of the way through the film.

The most interesting journey is the lead character, who's disease helps him relate to a population he once mocked.  The second most interesting, is the relationship of people to their government, and the way the government can interfere with people's health care in nagative ways.  That message is often overlooked, but especially timely in 2013 and 2014.",1392076800,,517,4.908045977011494

6118487,5,B00GUO3C3W,This is a must see movie.  Matthew McConaughey makes a miraculous transformation to play this character. Based on a true story a hard watch but worth the time.,1392076800,,159,4.678571428571429
6118488,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Good acting, was very realistic, also kept viewers interested. Very sad to know it was based on a true story.",1392076800,,109,4.5
6118489,4,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew McConnaughey's character was well developed and the sacrifices he made to play the role and his acting were Oscar worthy. With the exception of Jennifer Garner (who is pretty much portraying herself in every role she plays) the acting was superb.  I found the characters engaging although most of them were not very well developed.,1392076800,,339,5.053571428571429
6118490,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie just touched my heart and had to buy it to see it again!

It tells a true story of a Dallas man in the 1980's who gets HIV through drugs and unprotected sex.

After they tell him he has 30 days to live he decides to fight for his life even if the medical system and laws don't agree with his methods. Plus he starts helping others in the same circumstances.

He ends up living 7 years after constant battles with bureaucratic people who seem to be more interested in selling products for personal profit other than helping the sick.

It's a MUST WATCH! Recommended!",1392076800,,576,4.355140186915888
6118491,4,B00GUO3C3W,This is a serious drama and well acted. Leto and Matt are amazing actors. Gardner was great too. The fact that much of the characters' life details were completely fictional was a bit disappointing. There's not a whole lot of info on the actual person that the story was based on. It's an uplifting tale. Good movie.,1392076800,,316,4.56140350877193

Matthew McConaughey is SUPERB in the role and deserves whatever awards he receives as well as the supporting cast.  It's also important to keep in mind as one is watching this movie the time that the story is taking place....at the beginning of the Aids epidemic and how little was known and how much things have changed since then.  Definitely worth watching, if only for the performances.",1392076800,,475,4.839506172839506

6118499,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This is a small movie that proves that a Great movie doesn't need special effects and green screens to entertain an audience. Based on a true person MacConaughey gives a solid and daring portrayal of a 1980's rodeo rider who lives for the next drink, drug, easy woman or good time. It's 1985 and Rock Hudson's death has shocked the nation that he died of AIDS. MacConaughey as real life Ron Woodruff finds himself passed out and admitted to the hospital where he is told he has AIDS and is only given 30 days to live. But in Woodruff's words ""Their ain't nothing that can kill Ron Woodruff in 30 days"". He learns that the only available medicine is AZT but that it's only in the testing stage and he can't get on the list. In the hospital he meets Rayon a pre-op transexual played by Jarred Leto (another stunning portrayal) who he learns is making the money to pay for his AZT by selling half of his supply to another desperate victim. Getting the AZT anyway he can he manages to find a connection to get the drug until that supplier dries up. It's then he partners up with Leto's Rayon to get the AZT from a Doctor in Mexico and then when that is shut down he branches out to other suppliers. Don't want to give all the details as I want to leave most of the twists & turns for the next viewer to enjoy as much as I have.",1392076800,,1323,4.233201581027668
6118500,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I believe Matthew and Jared definately deserve the  oscars for the terrific performances, and weight losses, and acting out of contents like Jared did. I believe both will win, but probably the movie won't. It is very good anyway.",1392076800,,230,4.897435897435898

6118505,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The acting is excellent, but the film is such a downer. It is very depressing and very hard to watch. I know that this was an extremely difficult and sad time in our lifetime, but to watch and re-live it is an uncomfortable movie to get through.",1391990400,,245,4.23404255319149
6118506,5,B00GUO3C3W,"This movie is spot-on in its depiction of the era when AIDS exploded into social awareness. Nothing is left out in it's sometimes unbearable graphic portrayal of sexual excess and ""controlled substance"" abuse, but even so there is restraint here in that these scenes are not contrived or indulgent. The same is true for the haunting and tragic medical scenes and backroom dealings in AIDS medication.  Every scene is relevant as the story of one man's journey to find healing gives voice to the marginalized and discarded in our society.  Thankfully there is also a good bit of humor to balance the otherwise oppressive tone. The acting is unrivaled by every single actor.  There are no happy endings here but you don't turn off the TV feeling hopeless either. This movie doesn't cater to any politically correct notions and has no ideological ax to grind other than to expose failures of compassion. Overall, it is a story with profound humanity and dignity considering the subject matter..which is exactly what I feel the writer and director were attempting to accomplish.",1391990400,,1074,4.988826815642458
6118507,5,B00GUO3C3W,This was a movie my girlfriend was more interested than I was and I am so glad she was. Matthew will get the Oscar and the entire cast does first rate performances. Rent it with friends and go for HD. Enjoy!!!,1391990400,,209,4.121951219512195

6118512,4,B00GUO3C3W,"I would give ""Dallas Buyers Club"" a 4 1/2 star rating, mainly for the stunning performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.  Based on a true story about Ron Woodroof, who was diagnosed as HIV positive and given a diagnosis of 30 days to live, given that he was very ill and suffering from full blown AIDS at that time.  What I liked most about this movie was watching the transformation of Ron from a selfish, self-destructive, homophobic jerk into a man who learned to put other people ahead of himself.  He learned to not only accept his gay business partner Rayon (Leto), but to deeply care about him and even defend his honor when a ""friend"" was disrespectful toward him.  I also liked that Ron had the guts and determination to fight back against the doctors and government agencies that were denying him the treatment that could improve and prolong his life.  He fought the good fight for years, not only for himself but for others who were too sick to fight for themselves.  Jared Leto gave the performance of his career in this movie and he deserves the Oscar.  Rayon will melt your heart, guaranteed.",1391990400,,1116,4.634517766497462

6118581,3,B00GUO3C3W,"I've had a couple of days to think about this movie. I don't know that it's the triumphant masterpiece that it's being billed as but it was worth the $4.99 I paid to watch it.  Whenever an actor loses weight for a role, they make it out to be something more than what it is, as if ""well he must be a great actor since he lost 47 pounds for the role.""  I'm not sure I'd go that far.  But leaving that aside for a moment, this is a great story and it will take you back to the bad ole days of the eighties and the nightmare that was our treatment of people suffering from HIV and AIDS.  I wept throughout remembering how terrible it was.  I cannot believe I could have forgotten the battles with the FDA and the fight to get something to treat these people.  I remember how we would scream at the TV, MY GOD they're dying! Let them try any drug they want!  But that's a little one-sided and I think that's where the movie is a little lacking.

I'm having a hard time with this review because the movie's flaws are there but in other ways it kind of surpasses the flaws.  On the one hand, they make the FDA and the doctors one-dimensional bad guys, so worried about litigation that they'll let these people die before trying something other than AZT.  Now, with nearly 30 years of perspective, I can look back and realize that those doctors were doing the best they could in a bad situation that was overwhelming and beyond tragic.  I can also say that we were too slow but there are a LOT of reasons for being slow.  One of the reasons AZT was used was because they wanted something to treat these people fast, well fast got a lot of people dead.  The FDA has their flaws, make no mistake, but still these are good and decent people doing the best they can and the FDA does a remarkable job.  So, making them out to be the monsters of the film, ugh, I don't know.  It's just not that simple.

Now the character Ron Woodruff is pretty remarkable.  He's not likeable and whenever you get an anti-hero, the filmmakers try to redeem him through the film and they take you on his journey from being a zero to a hero. That's so played.  You get a lot of that here.  The journey of Mr. Woodruff is fascinating and very sad.  I am grateful to have heard his story.  I don't think I would have liked to have met him though.

What I got out of this film more than anything is just how cruel we can be as a race. How very unloved these people were and how much we have lost.  I really had forgotten how rotten it was back then.  It's not any better now, I know, but this film really brings it back. Overall I think you can watch this film and just try to do better.  We have to try to love the ones that aren't at all lovable.  Maybe even more because we ourselves are unlovable.  Just think about all we've lost because we couldn't see just how amazing they really are and the wonderful gifts they were.  All because we were scared or disgusted by what was different in them.",1391990400,,2963,4.1599297012302285

Sex and language aside, this is nothing stronger than what your kids see on regular cable anyway, so don't pass up a chance to use this movie as a very teachable moment.  Matthew McConaughey gives one of his most stunning performances as a straight cowboy who has AIDS in 1985 Dallas TX.  The pure idiocy the world had about this disease bleeds through the screen with every scene.  With plenty of laughable moments, and many tear jerkers, this movie shows that AIDS affects people from ALL walks of life.",1391990400,,591,4.6

A harsh story about harsh people - you need to really be in a mood for this material.  It's not a ""feel good"" movie - but it is well done and well worth watching.",1391990400,,494,4.104166666666667

Paid $5 only to have Amazon keep dropping down to horrible 1-star video quality, stall out and constantly drop the connection to the stream.

Dear Amazon, if you are going to stream ""rentals"", then you are going to have to at least deliver a modicum of service.  From what I've observed of late, Amazon streaming is getting worse and worse with each passing month.  Very frustrating.  Amazon is quickly becoming a web site to avoid when I want to enjoy a good movie.

But! this is what did happen back in the 80's when HIV first became exposed. pharmaceuticals companies in it for the money and still today will not release more improved meds, which I am sure they have in their labs and locked up.

Matthew McConaughey is absolutely phenomenal in his performance.  Jared Leto is unreal and both he and McConaughey should win Oscars.

His relentless pursuit of an effective, affordable and available alternative treatment for HIV/Aids is informative, provocative, rather clever and extremely edgy. The movie is filled with factual informative about the FDA's position in the early treatment of HIV/Aids which I was not aware of. Additionally, his character challenges Physicians' attitude toward alternative treatment of HIV/Aids which is very edgy. Although the movie addresses a sad and unfortunate societal issue, Matthew McConaughey brings forth humor and raw emotion in a way that soothes and encourages the audience.

The extraterritorial purchase of non-FDA approved treatments for HIV and AIDS was daring and very interesting in 1986.  What is so interesting about it 28 years later?  Nothing, in my view.  None of the relationships among the characters are particularly interesting; that Jennifer Garner's good doctor character sides with Matthew McConaughey is practically forecasted from their first scene together.  It isn't interesting.  Even Jared Leto's character was dull and kind of pointless.

This is also a great essay on how big Pharma is sometimes ""rush to market"" before understanding their own medicine.  Think of all of the commercial disclaimers now that go with these seemingly ""great"" medications. Taking matters into their own hands for their own survival, Ron (Matthew McConaughey) and Rayon (Jared Leto) form an unlikely bond that speaks volumes and brings immediate solutions to those in need.

6118685,4,B00GUO3C3W,"About a decade ago there was a small list of movie subjects virtually guaranteed to earn an actor an Oscar nomination. One of those coveted roles was someone with AIDS. Tom Hanks gave his majestic turn in Philadelphia and for a while the floodgates opened wide. Yet it slowed down dramatically as society changed; we became used to HIV/AIDS as a part of our daily social contract, and new fears arose to challenge the dramatic audiences. But for millions of people, the rise of AIDS was not just bait for acting accolades, it was a nightmarish reality they dealt with inside a world scarcely ready to understand it. In those times, people struggled to survive in any way they knew how and this story highlights one of those desperate and unstoppable souls.

Dallas Buyers Club tells the tale of Ron Woodroof, a salt-of-the-earth, trailer-dwelling electrician who has lived his life in a haze between bottles and bimbos. Then the ball dropped, along with his T-cell count, and he found out he had HIV. Using his brain, which few people would ever imagine he had, he hustled, wheeled and dealed his way through medical trials and experimental treatments in order to stay alive. Once he realized that he could do it, he saw an opportunity to do the same for others, while also turning a nifty profit. Hey, even angels have a little dust on their wings.

Being a true story about the phenomenon of these buyers clubs (where AIDS patients paid for memberships and got medications as a loophole through existing drug laws), its inherently dramatic, but the film shines far more in its performances than its storytelling. It needs to cover years of Rons life skating away from the long arm of the law, while still fighting day-to-day to keep his body healthy. Due to that time frame, it feels drawn out at times, but thats where you find yourself watching the actors more their skill more than their story.

Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto form an unlikely bond, not only through their characters, but also through the sheer trial they put their bodies through for the roles. Both actors were freakishly thin at varying points (nothing like Christian Bale in The Machinist, but damn close), yet emanating from those emaciated frames was an intensity which draws you in. The efforts and skills paid off because both McConaughey and Leto walked away with Oscar nominations (as did the film itself.)

The movie also acts as a not-so-subtle polemic against the FDA and its cozy relationship with big pharma. In a country with millions upon millions of sick people in desperate need of specific medications, we watch in horror as the FDA ties it up in red tape, blocks approval of experimental drugs and outright lies about current treatments being useful, all in the name of record setting profits. Whether or not the unconscionable behaviors of the FDA agents in the film are completely accurate, the taste in your mouth when the credits roll is less than sweet.

Dallas Buyers Club stands as a story of survival against all odds, interwoven with strong performances and strong opinions.",1391731200,,3080,4.836812144212524

6118702,5,B00GUO3C3W,"The 2013 release Dallas Buyers Club has been critically lauded. It's won many awards, not least for the 2 stars (Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto). I was eager to see it.

I wasn't disappointed. The film is based on the life of Ron Woodroof (pronounced Wood-ruff), played by McConaughey. In 1985 this good-ol' boy, straight homophobe was told that he not only had HIV, his t-cell count was so low that he was given 30 days to live. He wasn't going to take that lying down!

In the film he goes to the library. He researches HIV, AIDS, & what treatments are available to him (none). He tries to con his doctor (Jennifer Garner) into putting him into an AZT trial. When he collapses again, he regains consciousness next to Rayon, a luminous transgender beauty played by Jared Leto. Rayon IS on AZT, but already splitting her trial dosage with another, & declines Woodroof's plea to split it with him too.

Eventually Woodroof ends up at a clinic in Mexico. The doctor who runs it is vehement against AZT! 'That stuff is poison!' he says, & instead puts Woodroof onto a course of vitamins, protein injections, & European-approved drugs. Woodroof packs his car full of these items & heads back across the border. Where, despite wearing a priests' collar, he's stopped & questioned. Eventually he & the medication do make it back to Dallas, but here Woodroof runs up against a brick wall: his own homophobia. He just can't bear gay men, so selling something that'll save their lives is difficult for him. Re-enter Rayon...

McConaughey as Woodruff is gritty. His emaciated form & drunken/stoned lurching around are entirely believable. But it's Leto, as Rayon, who electrifies the viewer. Leto also lost 30lbs for this (fictitious) role. He studied transgendered men in depth, & improvised the role of Rayon as he saw fit. He's astounding. Rayon is no angel. S/he's an AIDS-ravaged junkie who has lived her life as a sexual outlaw. In the most affecting scene, Rayon isn't even wearing makeup. Dressed as a man, he goes to visit his father, a banker. The father berates Rayon for his 'choices'. Rayon stares at his father & says 'there wasn't any choice. This is who I am.' Pow!

I'll be honest; I re-watched this movie twice after my initial screening. It's simply 1 of the best films I've seen. Gay, straight, documentary, comedy, you name it: Dallas Buyers Club deserves every single award it's been nominated for.",1391644800,7,2412,4.7745803357314145
6118703,5,B00GUO3C3W,Matthew McConaughey nailed this!  Such a moving story.  I am glad we have come such a long way in HIV treatment and research.,1391644800,3,125,4.391304347826087
6118704,3,B00GUO3C3W,"AIDS was, and still is to a certain degree, one of the most misunderstood and underestimated viruses to ever take root in mankind.  When the first cases started to trickle in, it was dismissed by many and assumed to target certain individuals, many people feeling that it was impossible for them to catch it.  Even today, recklessness and misinformation has caused many to underestimate the seriousness of this disease.  The 80s in particular were a rough time for people dealing with this disease.  Misconception caused many to ignore symptoms and then when things were unavoidable, getting the proper care was nearly impossible, and in a way it was absolutely impossible.

Enter Ron Woodroof.

Woodroof defines rather perfectly the entirety of these issues.  He was a straight man living a reckless life that contracted HIV and then ultimately AIDS due to his substance abuse.  He thought AIDS to be a gay mans virus and thus he deemed himself untouchable.  He was wrong.  When he finally came to terms with his desperate situation, he found that getting the medications that would help his condition was harder than it should be, and in the end it became apparent that the drug being peddled to people in his condition was actually making things worse.

Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Dallas Buyers Club is that little film that could, that film that no one really saw making much of a stir past the obvious physical transformations of the two male leads and yet it went on to snag six Academy Award nominations and looks set to win at least two of them, possibly three.  When watching Dallas Buyers Club Im forced to ask myself what it is that made this so palatable to the Oscar crowd, and I have to say that it is for reasons that make them less than a great movie; sadly.  All of the things that AMPAS loves so much (sympathetic character arcs, simplified facts, stereotypes, underdog elements, broad theatrics) are rampant in this film, which is a sad reality when you get your hands on some of the facets of the true story behind this film.  This could have all played out so differently.

Ron Woodroofs story is, in itself, rather remarkable.  Given thirty days to live and no real help, Ron was left to his own devises and with what he had, he lived for seven years.  Instead of laying down and dying, like he was told to, Woodroof sought out treatment, both legal and illegal, from all corners of the globe and wound up being a savior to many men and women suffering from AIDS and living without hope of ever really living.

Dallas Buyers Club attempts to tell us this story.

My main issue with this film is the direction from Jean-Marc Valle.  You can lather on all the elements that make this a poorly written film and yet, with superb direction the film could have floated easier.  Sadly, Valles direction is so pedestrian that the film feels almost dull, boring even, in many parts.  It just sits there, with little to no real presence.  It is also tonally inconsistent, and I blame Valles inability to find his footing with the material.  The editing is also choppy (why was this nominated for that?), which leads to a very uneven film that feels like a collection of scenes as opposed to a cohesive story, with many moments that either feel out of place of unnecessary.  And this leads me to my issues with the script itself.  It just feels so flatly underdeveloped.  No real aspect of this story feels wholly fleshed out.  I also was baffled at the obvious moments thrown in with no real context in order to present seeming character development.  That grocery store scene was so out of place and felt to overly theatrical for the character in question that it failed to do what it intended (show Woodroofs growth as a human being) and merely made the film seem lazy.  Woodroof feels in many areas like a caricature, and some of the other players feel either completely vacant of all purpose (Eve) or like an extreme stereotype (Sevard, Barkley).  Rayon, while an obvious amalgam of every transgender stereotype of the 80s, is the only character that felt whole to me, but a large part of that was due to Letos brilliant performance.

The film has come under fire recently for misrepresenting facts, especially concerning Woodroofs persona.  I find this disconcerting, because representing Woodroof as a homophobe turned gay rights activist feels like a cheap attempt to garner sympathy and, in the end Awards traction.

Still, with all this bickering and seeming nitpicking, I cant say that this is an awful film.  It isnt.  It is just anticlimactic, and a film of this nature (or a story of this nature) needed more than that.  When the film was over, I felt as if I knew very little about the man and his journey, and the dumbed down presentation of the fight for and over AZT left almost no impression whatsoever.  It almost makes me wonder what this movie was even about.  While there are so many serious issues with the law, medicine, healthcare and especially the state of those three things during this time period, this film seems to blanket everything with a black and white these are the bad guys, this is the good guy perspective that it all feels false.

Both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto have been winning award after award for their transformative performances here, and its easy to see why.  They have very baity characters and have undergone such massive physical transformations to portray these characters that they are obviously being rewarded for various things.  For me, while McConaughey certainly gives of himself 100% here, he never really feels complete for me.  I blame a lot of this on the screenplay, which didn't make Woodroof feel like a whole person.  This also was not a stretch for the actor, outside of the weight loss.  Hes played the charismatic Texas hick before, and aside from a crying jag or two (and Ill mention that his crying scenes were his worst acted moments in the film), this feels like a typical McConaughey performance.  Leto on the other hand is actually rather remarkable here.  He completely disappears into this role and finds such nuances of character development, even with a character that wasn't really given many moments to fully develop.  The look he gives after Woodroof defends him, the asking of his father for money, the breakdown in the mirror; all of these singular moments are heightened thanks to Letos beautiful performance.

So, in the end, I have to express a certain apathy for the film in general.  I just didn't care much at all, and the sad thing is that this is one of those stories that we should all care an awful lot about.",1391644800,4,6644,4.714038128249567

I see now that he has put some weight back on but still needs to add another 20#'s. This cannot be good for a persons body no matter how they do it. Some of the story was a little far fetched but he had the right idea in trying to heal or cure his condition by doing it naturally. It is a shame how awful people were back when HIV came out in the open and how innocent people were accused of being gay when they contracted it from dirty needles, blood transfusions and sexual contact with others with HIV. I wish that he had contacted all the women he had sex with but then maybe he couldn't remember all of them!!

6118707,4,B00GUO3C3W,"""Dallas Buyers Club"" has all the drama associated with a ""true"" story movie already built in but, what truly elevates it beyond the norm are the exceptional performances in the film.

SPOILERS:

Matthew McConaughey has done exceptional work of late and this film is another feather in his cowboy hat. McConaughey plays  Ron Woodruff a homophobic electrician/rodeo rider who will screw any woman with a pulse. After being shocked trying to save a co-worker's life, he ends up in the hospital where his blood work reveals that he is HIV positive and progressed to full blown AIDs with a virtually nonexistant T-cell count.

He's in denial because he's never had sex with a male and doesn't believe that anyone other than gay men get AIDS. He quickly comes to accept his diagnosis when he learns that 17% of men can get the disease from being involved with IV drug users. When he discovers there is a trial for a new drug--AZT--he pushes his way into getting some despite the fact that he is rejected for the trial. Without physician supervision, he ends up taking a toxic dose of the drug and is hospitalized.

With the help of a sympathetic doctor (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico and a gay transvestite (Jared Leto in a brilliant performance) he meets in the hospital, Ron starts a ""buyers"" club where he can get medication for himself and others that the FDA hasn't approved but that (according to evidence) helps those with the disease.

END OF SPOILERS:

Anchored by McConaughey's and Leto's superb performances, the film gets able support from Jennifer Garner as a sympathetic doctor. As good and convincing as McConaughey's performance is (and it is essential to believe in the story itself), Leto positively shines losing himself in his role as ""Rayon"".

The writing is exceptionally good as is the direction but, what truly sells the film, are the performances.

The Blu-ray looks extremely good and, if it falls short of exceptional in areas like the amount of detail and depth, it has more to do with the choices of the director of photography and director than the short comings of the transfer itself.

The audio, although it isn't exceptionally active, sounds quite good as well. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is primarily a dialog driven film. The rodeo sequences exhibit the most depth and activity.

The special features are underwhelming and this is where Universal has failed to provide additional value to the consumer. We get two deleted scenes and a promotional featurette that acts almost as extended trailer for the film. What would have been nice is a featurette or two on the real people that inspired the film, a historical documentary on the times providing some context for the film (and contrast as there are clearly good guys and bad guys in this film but the situation was a lot more complex and less black and white than portrayed) and a bit of background on AZT itself (as well as other medications used in the drug cocktail) might have been nice to have.

I suspect that we will see a double dip here given the Oscar nominations. If the film wins, expect to see some sort of deluxe edition trotted out in a bout six months or so with featurettes. I would consider this verison the ""bare bones"" release version. I would normally recommend buying a film like this because it features such terrific performances but, given the lack of special features, I would hold off if you want to get some sort of deluxe version and not get stung. If all you are interested in is the film, by all means pick this up.

6118713,5,B00GUO3C3W,"In perhaps one of the most emotionally charged, brave, brilliantly acted films of the year DALLAS BUYERS CLUB opens door to emotions and facts and history that to this day remain tightly closed  - a film about the AIDS plague. Based on a true story and written with sensitivity by Craig Borden and Melisa Wallack and directed with equal verve and insight by Jean-Marc Valle (The Young Victoria, C.R.A.Z.Y.), this is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits. It deserves to be seen by everyone, not only for the incredibly fine performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, but because of the questions it raises about the interplay of disease, drug companies and current governmentally controlled medical practice guidelines.

Texan Ron Woodroof  (Matthew McConaughey) is an electrician, a rodeo cowboy, a heavy drinker and cocaine abuser, and a woman chaser for casual sex. In 1985, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V. -positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. His crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S. (especially the prolonged investigation of AZT), so Ron crosses the border into Mexico where he discovers Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), a discredited American physician with his own battery of drugs to fight AIDS. Woodroof learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). A true homophobe, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a buyers club, where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before.

In addition to the brilliant performances by McConaughey and Leto, there far fine cameos by Jennifer Garner, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Donna Duplantier and Griffin Dunne. This is a stunning cinematic achievement. Grady Harp, February 14",1391558400,3,2483,5.358974358974359

6118716,4,B00GUO3C3W,"As a nurse during the AIDS crisis in the 1980's, it was one of the most frustrating experiences of my career. Dying men, families and friends who rejected them. Homemade signs as anyone entered town saying ""BillyBob is a f*****, and he has AIDS. Funeral homes who would not take a person who had died with HIV. I could go on and on, but this film gives us a first hand experience.

""Dallas Buyers Club,"" directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e gives us the story of a man, who had unprotected sex, mainlined drugs and developed HIV. You can find this kind of story anywhere, but it is the performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto that bring this film to life. Ron Woodroof, played by McConaughey was a real-life figure. Diagnosed with HIV he could not believe it, a heterosexual man, cowboy, rodeo man, found himself with a 30 day life sentence. Unable to be part of the AZT trials, he began exploring alternative medications, went to Mexico and got better. He became partners with the men he detested the most, and soon became friends with them.

Jared Leto, as the transsexual, Rayon, is the epitome of an actor that transcends space and time. He deserves the Academy Award for his portrayal. We become emotionally involved with these two characters as they try to save their kind, while at the same time making money by charging to belong to the 'Club' and obtaining medications to keep them alive. Fighting the FDA, the physicians, big Pharma and any legal entity , they did their thing. Both actors lost a great deal of weight fir these roles, and it shows. We are waiting for them to keel over.

Try not to come to this film with pre-conceived ideas about this community. Let yourself into the story, and believe and observe their life. It takes a strong commitment to fight this good fight. Excellent film, but the performances will overwhelm you.

6118717,5,B00GUO3C3W,"I think Matthew McConaughey has been doing stellar work ever since he got out of that rom-com nonsense he was making for a number of years.  What a waste of his talent that was! In interviews he agrees that he was so glad to finally get roles which got him out of those films as well. Although I am losing count of the excellent jobs he has done in the last few years, this may be his finest achievement.  This is because he does handsome and charming so easily in all of his films and for the first half hour of this he is an almost detestable human being. The descriptive phrase ""sexist, redneck pig"" might have been personally coined for him in that first half hour which is saying a lot for the former leading man of rom-coms!

This is based upon the true story of Ron Woodroof, a heterosexual in Dallas, who was an AIDS victim in the 1980s, when at best you might buy a few years of life if you had the disease. He manages to get quite a few more by grit and determination plus buying trips to places where he can get better drugs outside the USA.

I didn't recognize Jared Leto for the first twenty minutes he was onscreen.  This was because he is in drag most of the time. He makes a very convincing woman.  When he goes to visit his father in men's clothing, it is the most heartbreaking moment of the movie. He does his best work since his supporting role in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.

Both actors look like complete and utter wrecks by the time we get to the end.  They must have had to lose a lot of weight. They really go the distance with these roles. I just watched AMERICAN HUSTLE on the same night.  The acting in both is equivalent.  It is hard to say who does better as it is like comparing apples with oranges.

I was in my 30s when the AIDS crisis broke and I remember it very well.  This is a very accurate recreation of the dismal time anyone with that disease had in this country.  It is better now, of course, but it was simply awful then.

Jennifer Garner does good supporting work as a doctor with these patients.

This is NOT another 'Philadelphia'. Shirking a sentimental or milquetoast script inspiring sorrow for the characters this film gives them the a nuanced raw edge and strength of people who take their destiny into their own hands.

Its not a story of someone dying of AIDS but of someone following their own instincts and taking risks to find alternative treatments to live with the disease despite what they are told by the FDA and other venal governmental institutions including the traditional medical establishment.

6118721,3,B00GUO3C3W,"Dallas Buyers morally-questionable Club
Dallas Buyers Club is a biographical drama film starring Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner. The film is based on the true-life tale of Ron Woodroof, an AIDS-infected person who began smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he found them effective at improving his symptoms.

McConaughey's portrayal is realistic as morally-questionable fighter. His HIV diagnosis doesn't automatically cause Ron to become a pious individual. He realizes that he could make money by importing drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that the drugs are for his personal use. He partners in his business with Rayon (Jared Leto), an HIV-positive transgender woman, since she can bring many more clients.

The pair establish the ""Dallas Buyers Club"", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. The film is enlightening in depicting that there were many AIDS-medication buyers clubs across the country. But if the long lines of people seeking the non-approved drugs (as depicted in the film) were true it seems that would have caused much unwanted attention.

Jared Leto gives a layered performance as Rayon. Rayon becomes the moral core of the film. She is there to show Ron's evolution against his homophobic prejudice. He is almost unrecognizable but his muscular body looks extremely well for someone who is depicted as an emaciated dying AIDS-infected drug addicted.

The characters of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) were fictional; the writers interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists and doctors for the film and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles.

While Woodroof was known for outlandish behavior, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was. Actually McConaughey's disposition as the confrontational brash character is as he has often been in film roles.

A major point is never made of Ron nor Rayon never expressing having any conscious regarding refusing to serve others who may not be able to afford the $400 Buyers Club fee.",1391299200,,2225,5.3247863247863245
6118722,4,B00GUO3C3W,"Consider Big Pharma and the medical profession: they are more interested in what's profitable than what actually helps the patients.

So a sort of vigilante medicine is at the heart of ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" a harrowing trip into the lives of AIDS patients in the mid 1980s. The direction is pretty nondescript, but the tragic true-life story and solid script somewhat buoy it up -- and the acting by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto is superb from beginning to end.

Electrician/cowboy Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is your typical cowboy type -- he drinks, takes drugs, and has sex with lots of women. Then he is diagnosed with HIV, and given just thirty days to live. Ron refuses to just accept the diagnosis, and starts searching for drugs that can save him.

Unfortunately, the only drug that MIGHT be able to save him is an antivital called AZT, which is in clinical trials for the next few years. So Ron sneaks it from the garbage and self-medicates. Then a doctor in Mexico prescribes him ddC and peptide T, neither of which have been approved by the FDA. But unlike AZT -- which doctors are pushing even though it's horribly toxic -- those medicines work.

So a defiant Ron decides to open a ""buyer's club"" to sell these medicines to people who need them, with the help of Rayon (Leto) a HIV-positive transgender woman he has befriended. But when the local hospital learns that Ron has been using and distributing unapproved medicines, they become determined to shut him down despite the good he's doing.

""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a devastating movie, because of what it reveals about AIDS in the past and present -- the fear, the hopelessness, the social ostracism, the slow failure of the body, and the uncaring Big Pharma/medical establishment. Most of the movie is just watching Ron wrestle the Grim Reaper into a headlock, even though we know he cannot win.

The biggest problem is that Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e's direction isn't as great as other parts of the movie. It's not BAD, it's just sort of... meh. It moves in a straight line from beginning to end, with directorial few ups or downs. But the low-budget indie feel does work well, giving a dusty realism to Vall&eacute;e's style, despite a few ""Hollywood"" moments like a sympathetic love interest doctor who is charmed by Ron.

I'm not really a fan of McConaughey, but I can safely say that he gives perhaps his finest performance ever here. He lost a lot of weight for this role, and it's often painful to see someone so emaciated and sickly, but burning with such passion and determination that it seems to eclipse his failing body.

He also handles Ron's changes in attitude with a delicate touch. He starts off with a vile attitude towards gay and transgender people, but his abandonment by his friends and his reluctant friendship with Rayon change him into a more open, accepting person. Ron never becomes a NICE person (he's still rough, crude and somewhat mercenary), but he does learn to appreciate who people truly are.

And Leto gives a pitch-perfect performance as Rayon, giving her a brashness and a vulnerability that makes her instantly endearing. Just consider the scene where she plays cards with Ron and casually talks about splitting the AZT. Jennifer Garner is the weak spot in the cast -- she's not bad, but her character is very Generic Hollywood Love Interest.

Despite some flaws, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a harrowing, heartrending piece of work -- as well as McConaughey's finest performance.",1391212800,8,3485,4.842016806722689

6118726,4,B00GUO3C3W,"This is the partly true story of Ron Woodroof, a redneck homophobic cocaine and sex addict who discovers that he is HIV positive after having unprotected sex with a drug addict a few years earlier.

Set in the mid-1980s when people still believed that the disease was confined to homosexuals and so contagious that touching anything associated with an HIV positive person could lead to infection, he is shunned by his friends.

The highly toxic AZT, still in its infancy, was administered in too concentrated a dose, killing as many people as the disease itself. Refusing to accept that he had 30 days to live and suffering side effects from AZT, Woodroof starts sourcing alternatives, first from Mexico, then internationally. Wisely, he doesn't ""sell"" his drugs, but dishes them out for free, charging a flat fee for membership of The Dallas Buyers Club.

The characters of Rayon and Dr Eve Saks are composites of transgender AIDS patients and doctors whom the writers interviewed and melded as supporting actors for the film.

Both Matthew McConaughey as Woodroof and Jared Leto (almost unrecognizable) as Rayon immersed themselves totally in their roles by losing 50 lbs (23 Kgs) and 30 lbs (14 Kgs) respectively, worthy of their recognition at the Golden Globes and Oscar nominations. McConaughey has matured from lightweight romcom eye candy into a fine actor - Mud and cameos in Bernie and The Wolf of Wall Street - to name a few.

Despite top drawer acting, the film as a whole falls a bit flat. At just shy of 2 hours, it was too long and, at times, repetitive. Sure, it was Woodroof's story, but Reagan's apathy to this growing pandemic was worth including, if only as an archival clip. Woodroof's frustration at the system was confined to run ins with the DEA, FDA, pharmaceutical companies and petty bureaucrats. Despite these shortcomings, it is an excellent depiction of our not too distant past.

The characters alone make this film a ""must see"". McConaughey and Leto are given free rein to portray every human emotion which they grab with both hands to make this a memorable movie.",1390262400,2,2096,4.890140845070422

6118728,5,B00GUO3C3W,"""The Dallas Buyer's Club"" will probably go down in Matthew McConaughey's carrer as the best film he has ever done. Losing over 70 pounds for the role Matthew plays a real-life HIV positive/AIDS patient who is infected with the disease in 1985, the beginning of the AIDS epidemic.

 Ron Woodroof (Matthew) is a straight rodeo cowboy who has negative feelings towards gay to the point of homophobia. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS (because of unsafe sex with multiple women) he soon finds his world upside down and realizes AIDS is not just a gay disease and that it has no boundaries.

 The film takes an honest look at how HIV/AIDS patients were treated during the Ronald Reagan years when , he as President, never once uttered the word AIDS and showed little compassion for those inflicted with it. If Reagan had assigned more money to AIDS research and for medicines to help people live longer and healthier lives thousands of men, women and children may be alive to this day.

 Once Ron Woodroof realizes the AZT drug (the only drug that was made available to AIDS patients at that time) was actually killing him even more he discovers that in other countries like Mexico and Japan there have been discoveries of new meds but they are not available in the U.S.. So, he arranges to go to these countries, bring in the pills and sells them to those who can afford them. Remarkably, when Ron was diagnosed he was told by doctors he had 30 days to live: he lived for seven more years!

 The ""Dallas Buyer's Club"" is nominated for an astonishing six Oscars this year including nominations for Matthew as Best Actor, Jared Leto (as a transgender HIV positive woman) as Best Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay and Best Picture.

6118729,5,B00GUO3C3W,"Directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e (The Young Victoria, C.R.A.Z.Y.) from a screenplay by first-time screenwriter Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack (Mirror, Mirror), Dallas Buyers Club is based on the life and experiences of Ron Woodruff, a Texas electrician and rodeo hanger-on who, when diagnosed with AIDS and told he only had 30 days to live, refused to just roll over and die.

The movie begins in Dallas, Texas in 1985, when AIDS was just beginning to emerge in the public consciousness. Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey in an absolutely amazing performance) is a 35-year-old electrician and rodeo hanger-on who lives hard and parties harder, everything from smoking and drinking to drugs and careless sex.  When an injury on the job ends up sending him to the hospital, the doctors there do some tests and awkwardly inform him that he tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. They then inform him that he should start putting his affairs in order as they estimate that he only has maybe thirty days to live. Ron, a stereotypical homophobic redneck, angrily rejects the diagnosis, believing - as most people did back then - that AIDS was something only ""f[expletive for homosexual]s"" got, the mere implication being more offensive to him than the potential death-threat of the disease.

Woodroof immerses himself in booze and drug binge denial at first.  But when thinking about something he read - about how some people get AIDS from intravenous drug use - he reflects on some past behavior and comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. Snapping himself out of his depression, he begins to read everything he can find on AIDS, particularly on treatment research.  At the time, the drug AZT was the only thing that seemed to show any promise at combatting the disease.  The problem though was that AZT was only in the clinical trials stage in the US, a process which was going to take a year before the drug could be approved by the FDA for doctors to prescribe to patients.  Facing a 30-day diagnosis, a year's wait was a death sentence for people like Woodroof.  Refusing to accept the situation, and faced with no way to legally buy the drug, Woodroof sets out to get it any way he can. Eventually he ends up going to Mexico to a clinic run by a Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), an American physician whose license was revoked for violating US regulations in his AIDS-related work. Dr. Vass puts Ron on a cocktail of other drugs, along with some vitamins, that he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms of AIDS, there being no known way of treating the HIV virus itself.

Seeing an opportunity, Ron begins to buy up large stockpiles of the unapproved drugs and vitamins and smuggle them into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons to help pay for the costs of his own treatment. To broaden his reach, the still very homophobic Woodroof enters into an unlikely partnership with a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto in an equally bravura performace), a fellow HIV patient, who he met during a stay in the hospital, realizing that Rayon would have more contacts with AIDS patients in the gay community, which at the time was where the vast majority of them were. Eventually their questionably legal business grows into the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization that allows them to circumvent the law against selling the drugs by simply giving the drugs to members who have to pay a monthly fee for their memberships.

A lot of what makes this movie worth seeing are the outstanding performances by Matthew McConaughey (Magic Mike, The Lincoln Lawyer) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, Lord of War), both of whom went to extraordinary lengths to make this film (McConaughey lost 50 pounds and Leto lost 30 pounds to achieve the gaunt look needed to portray the effects of AIDS over time). McConaughey is amazingly intense as he takes Woodroof first through the emotional gamut of dealing with the AIDS diagnosis, and then transforms himself as he shows Woodroof dealing with his situation with absolute determination to survive regardless of what it takes, rapidly adjusting his life and his views and calling on talents he never knew he had to become the person he needs to be -  and the person other people need him to be - to survive. Leto's Rayon is also a great character study, giving depth to his character by showing another side to Rayon's outer flamboyance, revealing things by his character's very unwillingness to reveal them.

*** Warning - Possible spoiler in next paragraph ***

But it is McConaughey who drives the film and who commands your attention.  One of the sequences that best shows the intensity McConaughey throws into his performance occurs as he shows Ron's life rapidly falling apart as news of his diagnosis spreads. His former friends turn on him, his co-workers refuse to let him on the job site, and finally he returns one night to his rented trailer only to find the door locked, an eviction notice taped to it, and the words ""F[expletive for homosexual] Blood!"" spray-painted across the side. To which McConaughey's Ron responds in sheer rage, yelling to the silent trailers around him ""I still live here, you hear me?! I fu[expletive]in' live here!!"" He is _so_ not going gentle into that good night.

*** End of possible spoiler - You may read safely from here on. :)  ***

The rest of the cast is also quite good.  Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno) is effective at bringing out the dilemmas of the time as Eve Saks, the doctor who gets to know both Woodroof and Rayon, caught between her desire to help and the restrictions put on her by the medical bureaucracy, particularly as she comes to doubt the approved approach both in terms of its effectiveness and its motivations. And Steve Zahn (Treme, Diary of a Wimpy Kid) provides a nice counter-balance as Ron's sympathetic brother Tucker, a Dallas cop caught between enforcing the law and the ties of family.

What's also remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is that it was made on a comparative shoestring budget - just $5M - most of which McConaughey had to raise himself. And yet it looks better than half of the big-budget films hitting theaters these days.  And partly because of this, there's a leanness to the feel of the film that fits the core story, where time matters and no moment can afford to be wasted.

Highly, highly recommended, not only for McConaughey and Leto's outstanding performances but for its portrayal of people struggling against not only a procedure-bound medical bureaucracy but also against a system geared against them by the enormous influence of pharmaceutical companies",1390176000,19,6664,4.828070175438596

List of propaganda includes but is not limited to:

Every black man in the film is gay!  This is in keeping with the new agenda of promoting homosexuality amongst blacks and trying to make black males appear to be prone to homosexuality instead of every woman's desire, as real life shows.

The gays are seen as human beings, doing the right thing in life and people who are to be respected.  It does not matter if he wants to be a woman or sleeps with young boys - if you are gay, you are OK.

This film seems to try and make Texas look weak and full of gays as well.  This might as well be ""Brokeback Mountain Part II!""

Women are shown as whores who are not to be respected, weak professionals or lesbians.  The agenda is clear.

Through the use of dates (when initially diagnosed in 1985, our hero is given 30 days to live), we know that this actually happened; it is a brilliant script by two newcomers, Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, who used Ron Woodroof's life to inform their script (he's ""Woodruff"" in the film).

  * Matthew McConaughey (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") is Ron Woodruff, a macho rodeo cowboy and hustler. When told his diagnosis he lets the doctor know in no uncertain terms, what he thinks of THAT: ""Straight men don' get AIDS!"" Mr. M. lost 45 pounds to add realism to his role.
  * Jared Leto (""Mr. Nobody"") is Rayon, a transgender wannabe who partners with our hero to form the Buyers Club, a gimmick that (temporarily) circumvents Texas law. He lost 40 pounds as well as waxed his body for this role.
  * Jennifer Garner (""Butter"") plays Eve, a doctor who sees the value of reducing the toxic doses of AZT, despite her medical colleagues and Big Pharma. See how that works for her!
  * Denis O'Hare (""J. Edgar"") is Dr. Sevard, the face we soon come to see as evil because he represents the implacability of the ADA and Big Pharma.
  * Steve Zahn (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") is our hero's brother Tucker, a Dallas cop and an all-around good guy.
  * Griffin Dunne (""Broken City"") is Dr. Vass, an American doctor exiled to Mexico because of his unorthodox approach to HIV and AIDS. This proves to be a game changer.

Ron Woodruff is a rake hell, so expect ""F"" bombs by the score, sexual situations (he didn't get AIDS sitting home watching TV), drug use and realistic depiction of dying victims. No wonder it is rated ""R"" and is awarded with wins and nominations! There isn't a weak performance; a tip of the Stetson to French-Canadian Monsieur Vall&eacute;e!",1389830400,14,2313,4.676543209876543

8627657,4,B00GUO3C3W,"The film is a compelling drama that shows talented performers doing their best. The only thing that keeps it from being truly perfect or something close is the fact that the movie centers around real people yet real events and important details showing the bigger context get glossed over. For example, the protagonist is shown being a homophobic and racist bigot before his HIV diagnosis; this was made up for the film's dramatic arc, with the real guy being a decent person throughout his life. Still, the movie is well worth watching, with these caveats.",1524528000,,557,4.873684210526315
