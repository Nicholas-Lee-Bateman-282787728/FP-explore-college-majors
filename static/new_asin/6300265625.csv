7807672,1,6300265625,"This video, made in 1969, not 1987, is not all that bad as an attempt to film an opera.  The acting is generally decent too.  But the sound is awful, and, after the first twenty minutes, the language changes from the Italian to German. There are no subtitles throughout. The film was made with the Berlin Comic Opera orchestra and conducted by Kurt Masur.  None of the singers is well-known.  Unless you are an Otello on video and DVD collector, I would avoid this one at all costs.",994550400,,482,4.443181818181818
