8154024,4,B000K2UDY6,"We've had this DVD for about a week and have made it through the first 4 patterns. It takes us going back a few times to work out the footwork but it's all there. Grant and Darlene make it look easy and graceful and gives one hope of getting there oneself. The DVD is not top notch (a bit grainy) as it is converted from VHS but there is NO trouble seeing what is being taught. There are not many country waltz DVD's and this one has given us enought moves to look forward to the next dance. We will be getting Vol. 2 when we have this one fully consumed.
I could pick at a few ways they choose to film and present this but the bottom line is that it works, we have learned some very cool waltz steps.",1235952000,2,701,3.978723404255319
