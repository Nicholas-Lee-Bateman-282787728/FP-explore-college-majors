4903251,5,B005XIEV2C,"Indian culture and spirituality are usually not the best understood of topics, especially for those who don't have a direct connection or ability to visit a Hindu center, etc. Yet we all pretty much know a little bit of what the Hindu culture and Religion are about, and if is the case for you, I HIGHLY recommend this DVD. I brought it home and my roommates watched it 3 times! It gives you a very decent perspective on what 18th century India looked like, as well as providing some fantastic views of the landscapes of India, north to south.

If you're looking for a good 40 min experience of India, and/or if you're a history/travel buff, this is the movie for you!",1320537600,14,668,4.475409836065574
4903252,5,B005XIEV2C,"Mystic India is a must see for anyone who wants to see the beauty of India and  experience her rich vibrant culture. I especially loved the part when Neelkanth, not yet a teenager, travels barefooted through the Himalayas. The scene is beautiful and breathtaking. The vibrant background music made my heart skip a beat!  In fact I bought the Mystic India soundtrack CD and use it when doing my morning yoga! It takes me to another world! Highly recommended for those wishing to experience India in an intimate and personal way.",1320451200,11,527,4.78021978021978
4903253,5,B005XIEV2C,"I saw this film twice in Toronto when it was showing at the IMAX theater and again in India. Every time I saw it, I discovered something new...and it gave me a reason to watch it again. Adults and children alike would enjoy this movie. Mystic India is a beautiful visual journey through the breathtaking landscapes of India. I have been to India before and this movie does a great job in immersing me into the culture and scenery of India. The extraordinary story of young Neelkanth and his journey across India was both inspiring and touching. I especially loved the scene when he comes face to face with a lion...a true reflection of his fearlessness. This film is full of color, music, and inspiration...great for all ages!!! This is one DVD that won't get old.",1320364800,3,764,4.625
4903254,4,B005XIEV2C,"This movie was shown at our local IMAX theater and the Museum had requested a group of parents (mostly home schoolers) to review the movie to see if they would purchase it for a full run. The kids tended in general to like to the movie - it was better than the standard documentary or ""school movie"" since it followed a story. The parents in general liked the education part - but they were looking through the lens of I need to teach my kid something.

The theater did wind up running this movie on the IMAX screen. My wife and I took our kids (who were two and one at the time). The youngest was happy to be there liked the colors and then promptly went to sleep. My older daughter did take something out of the it, and we will be showing this again to them as a recap.

Personally I like the fact that there is a story arc to follow as the movie unfolds. The learning happens organically while watching the movie. Peter O'Tooles narration in my opinion can get a bit tiring towards the end. Overall highly recommended.",1320019200,3,1021,4.284974093264249
4903255,2,B005XIEV2C,"There was so much hype and hoopla when this movie was launched. I missed the movie when it played in a local theater. So I purchsed the DVD over Amazon and sat down to watch-  with some anticipation.

What ensued amazed me! I had seen entire story before - in the trailer !

What an annoying waste of my time and money! Tchah!",1414800000,,326,4.142857142857143

4903257,4,B005XIEV2C,"Very nice. As one who has visited India six different times and pretty much traveled the length and breadth of it, not as a tourist but as a bona fide traveler, I was able to revisit places I had been. I appreciated the trailer and got a lot out of it as well. Music that went with it was overrated though.",1414022400,,306,4.032786885245901

4903259,4,B005XIEV2C,The best film yet that gives you the history of India's spirituality. Our family thoroughly enjoyed this film. We went ahead and bought the dvd after streaming it and the quality was even more spectacular. A must have for your dvd library.,1402617600,,239,4.714285714285714

4903261,5,B005XIEV2C,I purchased the Mystic India DVD to help me understand the Indian culture. I believe the DVD is based on a true story of the spiritual leader of the BAPS society. As well as a spiritual journey it is also a documentary on India. The photography is superb & Peter O'Toole's commentary very informative.,1397260800,,301,4.592592592592593

It's one of my most favorites stories and there are thousands of these in India which power victory to humankind, and makes beasts into angels, the simple story of a boy yogi!  Just my opinion.",1396742400,,338,4.810344827586207
4903264,5,B005XIEV2C,"The filming is outstanding. The narration of Peter O'Toole: first class and captivating. An excellent introduction which captures wonderfully the essence of India's soul, religion, culture and its lovely people ! Why not yet a blu-ray edition, that's a great pity !",1391904000,2,265,5.333333333333333
4903265,5,B005XIEV2C,"Many of us who were fortunate to see this inspirational film in large format during its IMAX world tour, are relieved to finally be able to see the film again on the DVD release we've been clamouring (and longing!) for. A friend and I saw it together at an IMAX several years ago and were so enraptured by it that we were too blissed out to speak to each other on the drive home. No description I could give would ever do it justice so I'll just say - this is one not to be missed.

Just do yourself a favour. It was designed for and meant to be seen on the large format screen, so an ordinary TV won't do it justice and may disappoint you. Let your first viewing be on the biggest screen, with the best sound system you can get access to. If you are fortunate to have a home cinema, this is one film that will definitely justify your investment! Get the full immersive experience; I guarantee it will be worth the effort! But I wouldn't diminish it by trying to tell you what you'll find.

See for yourself. Something wonderful awaits . . .",1391558400,3,1041,4.2

Land of colorful customs and fascinating events with celebration that paint the sky but the most valuable treasure can not be seen at all; the spirituality. Seeking life beyond our material world, striving to elevate human spirit, seeking to know not how to conquer the world but how to live in peace. How to understand life and life beyond death. Powerful narration by Sir Peter O'Tool and a music mix which will enlighten your soul. Spectacular, educational, inspiring and entertaining. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1371168000,2,587,5.061855670103093

4903275,5,B005XIEV2C,"Mystic India is an inspirational tale of a determined, buddhalike child who undergoes a fantastical journey from his home into the unknown, crossing the breadth and width of india before returning full circle. It is the true story of Neelkanth, a ""child-yogi"" who lived in the 1700's and brings into focus the many cultures, religions and climates united in what is perhaps the oldest civilasation - emerging from the Indian subcontinent. The story contains a subtextual message and is a metaphor relating to the commonality  and sacred nature of all life and the spiritual journey we must take toward enlightenment and self-realization which ultimately brings us back to ourselves with a newfound ""cosmic consciousness"".
The cinematography is phenomenal and the scenes of human and natural interactions are touching and moving. Also there is an option for  choosing audio in English or Hindi.
I highly recommend this film to anyone, but especially those interested in discovering the stories of spiritual greatness and human sensitivity, and who wish to renew the sensation that humanity's ultimate urge is toward goodness. Namaste!",1357776000,5,1133,5.359550561797753
4903276,4,B005XIEV2C,"... for making someone want to visit India!  The story line is quite interesting (although a bit hard to swallow--as most legends are I suppose), but the real impact of this film is as a vehicle to see the beauty, splendor, color and exoticism of India.  I was mesmerized by this film when I saw it at an IMAX theater (in fact, I visited India shortly after seeing this film), but it definitely does not have the same impact on TV (even on a large screen) as it did on the IMAX screen.  If you see this, see it on as big a screen as possible.  Gorgeous cinematography!",1357171200,6,568,4.231481481481482

4903278,5,B005XIEV2C,"A very beautiful and synpathetic film of Swami Narayan, a most influential figure of Advaita Vedanta Philosophy. Visually gorgeous -- circumstantially a brief tour of India following along the biographical main point -- and a textual screenplay of some subtle nuance. The Film itslef is only 45 minutes, but in this 2-disc set, the Extras are twice that long, and all of the Interviews and background revelations are contributory to an ever deeper appreciation of the Film itself. Need to watch it twice successively after that.",1349222400,3,528,5.151162790697675

The behind the scenes, gave me a greater appreciation for the effort that went into the production, especially when I realized the incredible scale of the volunteer force behind this film.  The volunteerism behind this film really surprised me as did the realization of the colossal undertaking required of such large-format films--from casting, to set-design, to the vast amount of research.  I found the film and the extra footage to be simultaneously educational, entertaining, and inspirational.  I have seen it three times now, and each time I discover something new.
