1856712,5,B00008OP5T,June 2008 - Loved it so much I purchased both the DVD and VHS the next day.  I will be watching this many times over and am pleased it is part of my collection.  Oh where is a time machine when you need it.  Love the 1700s yes life was short but it is the quality not the quantity that matters.  Just made my day and brought stunning colour into an ordinary rainy day.  I just saw it quite by chance and thought oh goodness this is FANTASTIC!,1213056000,,442,3.977272727272727
1856713,5,B00008OP5T,"Okay, so I haven't seen this movie, but I am really interested in buying it.  I have no idea where to get the movie though, as it seems to have no USA version.  Does anyone know why this is? I really want amazon to carry a version for the united states!",1188000000,,253,3.9411764705882355
1856714,5,B00008OP5T,"One of the best films I have seen in a long time!  A fun, joyous romp with a gang of men scouting for wealthy wives in 18th century island.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",1142726400,,177,4.0285714285714285
1856715,4,B00008OP5T,"This is a nice little romantic comedy from across the pond.  Set in 18th century Ireland where only eldest sons inherit family wealth, a group of young, penniless aristocrats decide to take matters into their own hands.  They form the Abduction Club, with the goal of trying to woo young heiresses and then elope with them.  When two of the penniles heros Strang and Byrne (Matthew Rhys and Daniel Lapaine) set there eyes on Kennedy sisters (Alice Evans and Sophia Myles) they find romance can be hazardous.  The story is a little predictable but satisfying and the cast is young and beautiful.  All in all a pretty good date flick.",1137888000,,632,4.709090909090909
1856716,5,B00008OP5T,"Hands down my favorite romance!!!! The actors are superb and the chemistry feels real, making you get out of your seats to cheer on the characters to win their love! This has a little of everything: a lot of romance, a little comedy, and adventure! Buy it and watch it! I can guarantee it won't be the last time you do!",1378598400,,319,4.245901639344262
1856717,1,B00008OP5T,"We were unable to watch 'The Abduction Club', because Amazon sold us a Region 2 DVD, which will not play in the United States. Very disappointed, because Sophia Myles is our favorite actress.",1377216000,,191,4.818181818181818
1856718,4,B00008OP5T,"With a wonderful warmth and charm and fine acting from its key players, this movie is a sweet romantic treat.",1374105600,,109,4.5
1856719,3,B00008OP5T,"This movie was cute. Sadly, that's really all there is to say about it. The subject matter and the characters were excellent, but sadly underutilized. It felt like a very watered down version of Casanova with Heath Ledger. This movie had serious potential to be every bit as good, but for some reason, maybe it was the director, the writers, or (most likely) the budget, it just couldn't quite deliver. I think it all could have worked much better if everything wasn't pinned to one crazy/bad guy who has no real reason to be around in the first place; it just brought the whole caliber of the production down to a harlequin novel. Not even a good one at that.

There were a few good moments, and even a twist I genuinely didn't see coming (and I'm paranoid about looking for twists). Anyone who has seen the 10th kingdom would recognize prince wendell, or rather the dog who impersonated him, and he and his plot line saved much of the movie. If the film stuck to the original premise of the story of the relationships building rather than the hijinks going wrong (and not even in a fun way as per most romantic movies), then it would likely have been much more successful. Maybe even enough so to warrant a region 1 DVD release.

I would still recommend this movie, but don't expect it to captivate your attention. This is one of those flicks you play in the background while doing housework or something else that doesn't require much concentration.",1374019200,,1452,4.5807692307692305
1856720,5,B00008OP5T,Every once in a while you stumble across a hidden treasure.  This is one of them.  Very enjoyable. A movie I could watch multiple times.,1372636800,,136,4.4
1856721,5,B00008OP5T,"Really enjoyed this movie!!  Because it's a Region 2 movie, I can only watch it on my computer since I don't have a multi-region dvd player.  Maybe they will make a Region 1 dvd of this movie soon?  It's a great romantic period movie with a happy ending.  Have watched it numerous times already -- love the characters, the romance, the humor, the scenery (Ireland).",1365897600,,365,4.569230769230769
1856722,5,B00008OP5T,"Okay, so. I had looked for a few months, at least, to find this on an American DVD. But I couldn't find it anywhere. But I recently found that my computer can adapt to foreign DVDs. So I bought it with New Zealand formatting. And it worked lovely on my computer. So I was happy. And it was worth the wait. I love this movie!",1350000000,,324,4.0
1856723,5,B00008OP5T,"The Abduction Club is a great movie- a light hearted, romantic period piece. It is also loosely based on real events. What more could you want??",1297296000,,144,4.576923076923077
1856724,5,B00008OP5T,"A very delightful look into the love stories of young men born as second sons, who would never inherit the family estate. Reared as gentleman with no fortune, they must embrace either the priesthood or an heiress. A group calling themselves The Abduction Club decided that abducting an heiress for each member, in hopes to win her favor, was their aim in life. The camaraderie of the gentlemen and the problems they encounter is a comical look back into the true events of the times.",1241654400,,483,4.694117647058824
1856725,5,B00008OP5T,"This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched! This movie has romance, humor, and a wonderful ending; I was laughing out loud and smiling through the whole movie! It is based on true events and it is about the a club called ""The Abduction Club"", and it is full of men who are born second or third (and so on) in the family; which means they will not inherit the estate, inheritance, etc. So what they do is charm the ladies who are enourmously rich, sweep them off their feet and carry them off. However, two men are in for a great surprise when their abduction plans go wrong because two strong-willed girls won't fall for it! After finishing the movie, I was left with a happy and aching feeling. It's not supposed to be rated PG-13; more like PG or G! It's a wonderful family movie in which everyone one would love. However it is very hard to get and if anyone has it at home and would like to sell, please post it on Amazon. I would love to buy it from you and would appreciate your time.",1234569600,,1000,4.213541666666667

7986106,3,B00008OP5T,I love historical dramas based on true stories. The screenplay was not on the level of Pride and Prejudice and the like but it was still fun.,1434240000,,141,4.2592592592592595
