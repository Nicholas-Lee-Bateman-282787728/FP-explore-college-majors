8348053,5,B001YB2552,Very good content. Maybe some more player reactions. But that might be nit picking. Love to see any MLS products to come out. It's a piece of history for any fan of the league.,1378857600,,176,4.205882352941177
8348054,5,B001YB2552,"If you're a Columbus fan, this is the DVD for you. It doesn't show too much of the Crew's championship season, just a recap of the best goals and victories put to music. But there are quite of bit behind the scenes features, and they talk to the top stars of the Crew before and after the MLS Cup final. It has the final game in its entirety against the New York Red Bulls too. Overall, a great buy for a Columbus Crew fan, and just a fan of the MLS, like myself.",1267142400,4,463,3.989247311827957
