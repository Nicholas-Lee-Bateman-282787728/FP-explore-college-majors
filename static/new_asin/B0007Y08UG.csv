2250875,1,B0007Y08UG,"This movie is not worth your time.  If you are hoping for an accurate portrayal of the amazing Lewis and Clark expedition and the courageous young Sacagawea, this is not for you.  If you want to see Hollywood revisionism at its worst, then it is.  To list some of the inaccuracies:

1) There was never any romantic love triangle between Lewis and Clark with Sacagewea.  While they truly respected her and her help was invaluable, Sacagawea was a)married to the trapper Charbonneau b)pregnant when they met her and with a baby the rest of the trip and c) an actual Indian (Shoshone -- at least they got that right), not a blue-eyed Donna Reed in grease paint.  Lewis and Clark were best friends before, during and after the expedition.  There is no record of them ever even arguing with each other during this difficult trip.
2) The Indian ambush portrayed in the middle of the movie by the Mandan and the Hidatsa never happened.  In fact, there were only two hostile actions from Indians during the trip.  The first was a narrowly averted battle with the Teton Sioux who were known to demand tribute for travelers on the Missouri.  The second was a brief clash with a group of Blackfoot Indians where two Blackfeet were killed.  In fact only one American man was lost during the expedition and that was due to natural causes.
3) Charbonneau was not scheming with the Indians.  He was a fairly well-liked cook and received a hefty payment of $500 when the expedition was over with.  Sacagewea stayed with him for the rest of her life (most accounts place her death in 1812 although there is a legend that she lived to be 100 years old.)  At Sacagawea's request, Clark did take and raise her son after the expedition but never had contact with her again that we know of.
4) Sacagawea did not speak English.
5) Sacagawea made no trip to the White House and never would have called it the ""White House.""

Why the writers felt they had to embroider this truly extraordinary trip is beyond me.  Add this to a particularly dull plot and wooden acting by a cast of otherwise fine actors (even Charlton Heston couldn't save this one) and you have no reason at all to wast time or money on this dud.",1300492800,7,2189,4.531806615776081
2250876,1,B0007Y08UG,"Lewis and Clark are rolling in their graves at this movie.  It bares almost no resemblance to the actual trip.  It would take too long to list all the factual mistakes.

2250877,5,B0007Y08UG,Both my husband I have watched this DVD video and enjoyed it very much.  It is much like the Lewis & Clark Expedition.  I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.  We like to watch this type of movie over and over again.,1260403200,6,222,4.116279069767442

2250880,2,B0007Y08UG,"Apparently, the screenwriters thought an expedition that resulted in no battle casualties and no real fights with the indians was not sufficiently dramatic.  So they larded the story up with romantic nonsense between Clark and Sacajawea (and a non-existent love triangle among Lewis, Clark and Julia ""Judith"" Hancock).  For good measure, they threw in two pitched battles with indians.  None of this ever took place.

I think the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition is exciting enough to be told accurately.  Someone should develop a new movie of the Lewis and Clark expedition, one that tells the story straight.",1183593600,3,617,5.13

2250882,5,B0007Y08UG,"What a HOOT!  For out and out Hollywood History at its best this is the film for you.  Absolutely laughable from start to finish.  We get blue eyed Donna Reed as Sacajawea gazing like a cow at at Charlton Heston as William Clark.  ""Oh Bill!"", ""Oh Janey!"" they croon.  (Nevermind that Sacajawea actually made the trip with her baby and husband.)  The insanely ridiculous climax of this affair takes the form of an awkward love  triangle...in the White House no less!  Yes, Sacajawea, wearing a stunning powder blue leather outfit to offset her eyes, does a non-existant turn in Washington D.C. vying for the hand of ""Bill"".  Throw in non-existent conflicts with Indians, a non-existent near-courtmarshall of William Clark and, I'm not making this up, a rope net thrown across a river by ""savages"" in an effort to slow our intrepid heroes and you've got a whale of a tale.  (Picture Fred McMurry swimming through the water with a knife in his teeth and you'll have a notion of the fun that awaits you when you watch this baby)

When I wasn't holding my sides in laughter I simply stared at this puppy in slack jawed wonder.  A must see.",1121385600,12,1134,4.615
2250883,4,B0007Y08UG,"Released theatrically in 1954, ""The Far Horizons"" is an entertaining film about the Lewis and Clark expedition at the turn of the ninteenth century, a pivotal event in the history of the United States. I suspect that historians will roll their eyes at the ""Hollywood"" version of this famously long, arduous but important expedition that ultimately ensured that America would reach from ""sea to sea"". Personally I have no problem with actual events being ""enhanced"" for the entertainment, as well as the enlightenment, of an audience.

President Thomas Jefferson (avuncular Herbert Heyes) has just completed the massive Louisiana Purchase deal with Napoleon, greatly expanding the territory of the United States. However, this vast area now needs to be explored and mapped. The President decides that his loyal secretary, Meriwether Lewis (steadfast Fred MacMurray), is the man for the job, along with a soldier experienced in fighting Indians, William Clark (a driven, intense Charlton Heston). The Lewis/Clark partnership gets off to a rocky start since both men are in love with the same woman, Washington socialite, Julia Hancock (long-suffering Barbara Hale--Della Street on TV's ""Perry Mason"").

Fortunately, these necessary but rather dull opening scenes soon give way to the expedition itself, at which point the film remains consistently engrossing. Of course, this new territory is by no means uninhabited--many Native American tribes have long established themselves, and regard the coming of the ""white man"" with great suspicion, even outright hostility.

Clark, a veteran of various ""Indian wars"", has little patience or sympathy for these people. It is Lewis who must use all of his diplomatic skills to gain their trust, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. They meet the Shoshone maid, Sacajawea (lovely Donna Reed), a prisoner/slave of an enemy tribe. After a few ""hurdles"" are overcome, she agrees to serve as their guide--as it turns out, the trip would not have been successful, and they would not have survived without her. Her intelligence and beauty soon melt Clark's hard heart, and Lewis finds that he has the distraction of a romance on his hands, as well as more hostile tribes and natural disasters to contend with.

There are many scenes in this film which are gorgeous--the natural beauty of America's plains, rushing rivers, lush forests and snow-capped mountains more than compensate for the hardships that our intrepid explorers must endure.

The DVD is presented in widescreen format with outstanding colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.

""The Far Horizons"" is a rousing adventure that the whole family can enjoy. Mr. MacMurray, Mr. Heston and Ms. Reed are all highly watchable stars, and kudos to Paramount for releasing this lovely disc.",1120089600,56,2787,5.351598173515982

Fred MacMurray completely fades from the movie and ""golden boy"" Heston overacts as usual.  Donna Reed is completely miscast as Sacagawea, and the whole thing is just wrong.  The ending is totally ludicrous with the melodramatic reading of Sacagawea's farewell as she rides away in the carriage.  I mean, come on!  Really?

2250950,5,B0007Y08UG,"""The Far Horizons"" has the distinction of being the only big budget motion picture to focus on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, not counting numerous documentaries that have been produced through the years.

""The Far Horizons"" was a Paramount Pictures release from 1955 filmed in glorious Technicolor and VistaVision at many of the actual locations that were explored by Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery.

In 2011, ""Time"" magazine included ""The Far Horizons"" in a list of ten films that played fast and loose with historical facts. Apparently, ""Time"" did not take into consideration that there were very few ""historical"" films made throughout America's cinematic history that didn't do the same thing.

Veteran film actor Fred MacMurray plays a rather straight-laced Captain Meriweather Lewis and Charlton Heston portrays a somewhat impetuous Captain William Clark. But the real scene stealer in ""The Far Horizons"" is slim, beautiful Donna Reed as the iconic Sacagawea.

Casting blue-eyed Donna Reed as the industrious Lemhi Shoshoni woman Sacagawea was a pure stroke of cinematic genius. Donna Reed in buckskin and braids added a big helping of ""camp"" value to this rollicking film.

Reed was fresh from her Academy Award-winning role in 1954's ""From Here To Eternity,"" and Sacagawea was a huge departure from her portrayal of a Honolulu dance hall girl with a heart of gold in that landmark Pearl Harbor film.

Setting historical facts aside and viewing the film from a purely entertainment standpoint, ""The Far Horizons"" holds up well as a Western/action/adventure motion picture. And the beautiful scenic location cinematography with all of its eye-popping colors is a huge asset to the film.

In ""The Far Horizons,"" the childless Sacagawea is the ""wife"" of the brutish, conniving French trader and trapper named Charbonneau.  In reality, Sacagawea was one of several young Lemhi Shoshoni girls who were taken captive during a raid by the hostile Hidatsa tribe around 1800.

Two of these Shoshoni girls were won by Charbonneau while gambling with some Hidatsa braves. Sacagawea was about 15 at the time, the other Shoshoni girl was about 13, and their new ""husband"" Charbonneau was about 45 years of age.

In early 1805, Sacagawea was about 16 when she and Charbonneau joined the Lewis and Clark expedition, and she had just become the mother of a baby son. The infant, nicknamed ""Pomp"" by the Corps of Discovery men, was taken along for the entire 15 months of the expedition.

In real life, thanks to the detailed journals kept by Lewis and Clark, we now have a fascinating account of their adventures that reads more like fiction than fact. It is said that Sacagawea saved the journals when they were almost swept overboard during the long journey.

An annoying aspect of the movie is the constant bickering and tension between Lewis and Clark, mostly over both being in love with the same woman back in St. Louis and Clark being chosen by her over Lewis for her affections. Then, during the expedition, Clark falls in love with Sacagawea. In reality, Lewis and Clark were the best of friends and worked well together, and Sacagawea, by all accounts, was faithful to Charbonneau.

In fact, it is recorded that the men of the Corps of Discovery were modest and polite around Sacagawea, and were very protective of her and her baby. And Sacagawea was recognized as playing an important role in the everyday lives of the expedition's members.

Throughout the journey, she gathered wild plants, fruits, and vegetables that added variety to the men's diet of mainly meat, something that helped keep them healthier. She also mended and made moccasins and clothing for the men, she cooked food and baked bread, she cared for her child, she made blankets and robes from buffalo and other hides, and she was fluent in Indian sign language, and the Shoshoni and Hidatsa languages.

Sacagawea's presence in the Corps of Discovery sent a message to Indian tribes that the group of explorers came in peace. Hostile Indian parties did not include women. This factor alone helped the expedition avoid numerous battles with Indian tribes they encountered that surely would have meant defeat to the explorers and a failure of the mission.

Overall, ""The Far Horizons"" is an entertaining movie. It may not be the most historically accurate account of this important exploratory mission assigned to Lewis and Clark by President Thomas Jefferson, but it is definitely the most fun.",1438300800,8,4479,5.040595399188092

2251010,2,B0007Y08UG,"I like old westerns, even weaker ones and I am a huge fan of Charlton Heston, even in his lesser films - but this thing was too bad even for me... Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

This film supposedly tells the story of Lewis and Clark expedition and from the cover it is easy to deduce that Saccajawea is also one of the main protagonists. Before even going into the annoying changes to the real history, let's just say that this film is in many parts boring as finally very little happens and we can hardly feel the thrill which should be associated with such an incredible voyage in the wilderness and the discovery of new, ucharted and unknown lands. Dialogs are mostly lame, humour is almost completely absent and even if a couple of (fictitious) battles with Indians (poorly filmed by the way) are thrown in, well, this thing never really takes off.

Casting a very blue-eyed and fair skinned Donna Reed as Saccajawea was of course a big mistake - if the mores of those times didn't allow for a Native American actress or a hot Latina, the director should have used at least a South European/Mediterranean type brunette. Because of this casting mistake Donna Reed, an otherwise talented and very attractive actress (well deserved Best Actress Oscar in 1953 for ""From here to eternity""), is forced to wear during all the time an embarassing face paint, which is completely RIDICULOUS and ruins most of this film. Also, real Saccajawea was 16 when the expedition began and at 34 Donna Reed was simply too old to play her...

If this was not enough, the real story of Lewis, Clark and Saccajawea is here changed ALMOST COMPLETELY! Here are the main points (SPOILERS ahead):

- no, Clark didn't steal Lewis fiance before the expedition or at any other moment

- no, Lewis and Clark didn't bicker and fight during the expedittion - they were best friends since already a long time before expedition and remained so until the end of their lives

- trapper (""coureur des bois"") Toussaint Charbonneau was a loyal and higly succesful guide for Lewis and Clark expedition, who was greatly rewarded for his services once the voyage was finished - he certainly WASN'T a back stabbing traitor plotting with hostile Indians

- there never was a romance between Saccajawea and Clark; in fact Saccajawea, after being for some time a slave of Minnetaree tribe, was bought by Toussaint Charbonneau and became his common law wife (she was 13 at this time); they remained together until her death. Messing with the woman of another member of the expedition and especially the main guide would have been not only dishonorable but also could jeopardize the whole enterprise - and therefore Clark certainly didn't even think about such a thing.

- there were NO battles against hostile Indians during the whole expedition - NOT EVEN ONE! The one dangerous situation which nearly degenerated into a battle was defused by Lewis with a large gift of tobacco - and also a bottle of whiskey...

- Saccajawea was pregnant at the beginning of the expedition and gave birth to a healthy boy soon after - the child, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, lived and became the mascot of the expedition and much later went to be a quite wealthy and succesful man - but in this film the pregnancy and the birth of the child are completely eliminated...

- Saccajawea most certainly never travelled to Washington, was NOT received at White House and certainly didn't meet the President of United States...

Taking all this into account I must say that for me this film is a failure. I could live with complete changing of history if at least it was an interesting and well made thing - but it isn't. Even good performance of both leading actors, Fred MacMurray as Lewis and Charlton Heston as Clark, cannot help it. Therefore you can skip it without losing much. Only for the greatest fans of ""Chuck"" Heston.",1400025600,4,3885,4.7407407407407405

2251030,5,B0007Y08UG,"I realize that this movie is not completely accurate and that a Native American did not play the part of Sacajawea, but I thought it played out well because it gave us a clear idea of some of the circumstances that led up to and possibly happened during this arduous journey west. The scenery was beautiful. My daughter is reading a book about Sacajawea and it opened her eyes to many interesting events in history. One of them being how the Indians lived and their devotion to the land was very apparent. I am very happy to have purchased this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand this part of history better. You may want to read about this part of history first, like we did, so that you can separate fact from fiction.",1358726400,18,750,4.402877697841727

8053848,3,B0007Y08UG,"Heston is the best acting here and Donna Reed is good,alto looks nothing like a Indian woman.

Would you?Not great but no real depth there.",1520812800,,323,4.491525423728813
