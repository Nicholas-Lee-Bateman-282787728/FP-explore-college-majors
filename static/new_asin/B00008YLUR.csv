7988215,3,B00008YLUR,"The film itself was alright but long and they could have cut a few of the ambient scenes--how many times do you need to see a Ford drive down and dirt road?  The actors were sexy, but the actor playing Ella Maillart is more butch almost than the actor playing Annemarie--Ella's hair was never that short! The books are much more informative historically and lively--the film maker took some liberties with their stories.  If you want to know more about Annemarie Schwarzenbach and Elle Maillart read these books on their journeys:  The Cruel Way, Death in Persia & All the Roads are Open--both women are fantastic writers/journalists and it's interesting to read their respective stories.  The one thing I did enjoy about the film was bringing to color some of the original places in the books--the film is lyrical in its vision, however long, and at least someone made an effort to bring to life these women and their brave individuality on the silver screen.  Nice effort, buy the books too, they are really fantastic",1386892800,,1019,4.8
7988216,4,B00008YLUR,"I don't understand the disappointed reviewers here. A little research at Amazon or IMDb would have revealed this may arguably be termed an ""art film"", but it certainly isn't lesbian porn, and why in the world would anyone purchase something they knew nothing about when they could easily rent it from Netflix or Blockbuster online? No, it's not in the same league as Aimee & Jaguar, but Jeannette Hain is fun to watch, the settings are gorgeous, and there's also some interesting music (that's what led me to this page - looking for a soundtrack listing). If you like travel stories and aren't left cold by subtlety, give this a try. Oh - the particular tune in question was ""Hindou,"" and you can hear it on The Lecuona Cuban Boys, Vol. 5 (1932-1940) Enjoy.",1149724800,4,757,4.656716417910448

I love it and it is one of my favorite movies about love between women.",1133827200,4,195,4.909090909090909
7988218,2,B00008YLUR,"This is an unusual travel film: part documentary, part (subtle) love story and part travel adventure. The movie is essentially based on the travel smitten Ella Maillart who has a high passion of seeking far and remote lands. After returning from a long trip to Tibet with the renowned Peter Fleming, she decides to seek the relatively undiscovered, unmapped and unknown region called ""Kafiristan"" (that means the land of non-believers in Persian) by car. For a reason that isn't very clear she picks an unusual travel partner in AnneMarie, who is recovering in a drug rehab center. AnneMarie is quirky, perpetually depressed and has extreme mood swings. The viewer cannot help wonder why a seasoned traveler like Ella would pick such an uninitiated travel companion (the reasons haven't been made explicit and are shown as subtle messages).

For a travel-centered movie, there is very little countryside and landscape. On most occasions they have shown the Ford winding its way through a dusty road. The viewer gets confused if it Turkey, Iran or Afghanistan. Surprisingly, there is no background movie score or it is unnoticeable.

In one of the scenes Ella and AnneMarie are riding their Ford across the high Afghan desert in their black Ford and they are being escorted by two Afghans riding on Camels. This majestic panoramic scene is the hallmark of a otherwise boring fare. People who like to travel might relate to the pull of traveling on a whim and seeking places seldom visited by people.",1130457600,3,1498,4.988
7988219,5,B00008YLUR,"A true story from more than sixty years ago, yet it could have happened yesterday in much the same part of the globe.  Slow, melodic, and like a day dream, no one denies the exquisite erotic tension that exists here.  Neither can it be denied that this perfume is found in a patriarchal world of imminent violence.  In one extraordinary scene after another, where communication cannot be had by the exchange of words, a rapport is obtained between the inhabitants of this world despite the inexorable progress to war.",1077408000,10,517,4.786516853932584
7988220,1,B00008YLUR,"I hated this movie...I don't think I can come up with anything nice to say at the moment about this it.  It was slow...boring...and well...odd.  Unfortunately we purchased this movie, so now we're stuck with it! :(",1076976000,2,214,4.756756756756757
7988221,1,B00008YLUR,"After catching the advertisement for this one in the Advocate, I bought this movie as a surprise gift for my fiancee, thinking we would have a gem of a time viewing the cross-dressing butchies Journey to Karfiristan, rich with sublime desert imagery and steamy lesbian action.
No such luck. ...
THIS MOVIE IS A BORE and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS!!!
I don't care if this is a divine chronicle of some notable women I have never heard of before or since...The movie seems little more than an exercise in free foreign travel for those who star in it, despite the actors best efforts to make something out of nothing.
With every frame that passes, you will wait... and wait... and wait... for SOMETHING to happen.
You will be amazed and become bewildered at just how very little of nothing ever happens.
And then you will become so very frustrated that you wasted your time waiting... and waiting... and waiting... for SOMETHING to happen, and once you have reached the end of this boring film and are absolutely distraught with disappointment, you will realize that you should have trusted me, and saved yourself the two-hours-plus you spent WAITING during this film.
Spend your time in this life wisely, and skip this trip.

F.W.I. - I wanted to give NO STARS for this one, because it SUCKED SO TERRIBLY, but Amazon made me give at least one star to write this review.

7988222,2,B00008YLUR,"In the months leading up to the Second World War, two women travel from Switzerland to Afghanistan to study an elusive nomadic tribe in Kafiristan. Writer Annamarie Schwartzenbach and researcher Ella Maillart embark on a journey that is both physical and emotional as they discover their own hopes and dreams. Unfortunately this film failed to capture my interest and was rather dull. Aside from the stunning cinematography of the Middle East and the (very) sexy Annamarie, JOURNEY TO KAFIRISTAN is a slow story with little insights of the human condition to offer the audience. I hesitate to recommend this film to others.",1061164800,5,623,5.117647058823529
