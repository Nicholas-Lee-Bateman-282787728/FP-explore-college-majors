4953053,5,B0064S0354,"I first saw this performance as a rebroadcast on PBS ten years ago. I recorded it, on VHS alas. I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD. Finally in 2010 it was released as part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Levine-Celebrating-40-Years-at-the-Met-DVD-Box-Set/dp/B0043XD08Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Levine: Celebrating 40 Years at the Met - DVD Box Set</a>, but the $249 price tag was prohibitive since I was not interested in any of the other performance. This DVD is put issued by the Metropolitan Opera and I would not count on in being available for too long. Grab it while you can.

Kiri Te Kanawa is stunning as you might expect. But the big surprise for me was the incredibly moving performance of Tatiana Troyanos as Octavian, reason enough all by itself for acquiring this DVD.",1333584000,6,852,5.5038167938931295
4953054,5,B0064S0354,"If you are in the hunt for a definitive live performance of this opera, this is the one for you. Everyone is in great voice and Levine is in his prime conducting. The production is breathtaking (even more so seen in person) and although lacking in the more sophisticated and digital videographic quality of the later entry with Fleming, the artistry of the principal singers still shines through. Listening to Troyanos sing reminds me of what a loss she has been to the stage. Te Kanawa is as regal as one could hope for and the end of Act I is touching and simple. Moll is sheer bourgeois vulgarity as Ochs and that true Bass is a joy to hear! And of course, the indulgence of having no less than Pavarotti cameo-cast as the Italian Singer just completes this important and historical broadcast. Thank God the MET had the good sense to re-issue it!",1329091200,14,849,4.51948051948052
4953055,5,B0064S0354,"These two disks present a 1982 performance of the Metropolitan Opera's beloved production of Der Rosenkavalier, previously available only as part of a 21-DVD set.  The staging, directed by Nathaniel Merrill and designed by Robert O'Hearn, is lavishly elegant.  James Levine leads a cast that could hardly be bettered.  As Fanfare's reviewer has written, ""No one has ever looked and acted more the Marschallin than Kiri Te Kanawa.""  Other stars include Tatiana Troyanos as Octavian, Judith Blegen as Sophie, Kurt Moll as Baron Ochs, and Luciano Pavarotti as the Italian tenor.  The audio is quite good (with a surround-sound option), the video quality generally so (but blurry in a few long shots).

I purchased this set after buying--and being dissatisfied with--the Paul Czinner film.  Even in its Blu-ray reincarnation, the 50-year-old film seems very dated.  One constantly feels that he is watching an old movie and needs to make allowance for the vintage of the sets, sound, and picture.  In contrast, the Met production needs no such handicapping.  The singing is about as good, and the acting is uniformly far better.  (The presentation of the rose is most impressive.)  Overall, I find Levine/Te Kanawa far preferable to Karajan/Schwarzkopf.",1322956800,19,1249,5.252525252525253
4953056,5,B0064S0354,"A big thank you to the MET OPERA for releasing this magnificent 1982 production of ""DER ROSENKAVALIER"" directed by the late great Nathanial Merrill and designer Robert O'Hearn.  Anyone who was a frequent Met attendant knows the many and wonderful productions of this wonderful team.

The dream cast of Te Kanawa, Troyanos, Blegen and Moll are perfect...the best of any cast available on any recording of this opera.  The final trio is Strauss at his most sumptuous and beautiful.  James Levine brings the orchestra to the lavish heights it should reach.

This performance brought back many memories of when I attended one of them.  Thanks again.

It's always wonderful to do business with the Met Opera Shop...shipping is very fast.  Please release any more ""gems"" like this DVD that you have hidden up your sleeve.

The video quality is perfect...clear and colorful and the audio quality of the DTS Surround is fantastic!  There are English sub-titles.",1322352000,16,953,5.051282051282051

8492847,5,B0064S0354,Fantastic version of this great Strauss opera. Dream cast. But don't be fooled. This DVD is not out of print and can be found elsewhere at a fraction of the cost.,1426636800,,162,4.258064516129032
8492848,5,B0064S0354,"I went to this performance at the Met.  I was a student and I could only afford seats way in the back of the top tier, but during the intermission after Act I, I made the acquaintance of a couple who had come to see and hear the famous Pavarotti sing, but had arrived late and missed Act I.  They were very surprised to learn that Pavarotti's role was a cameo and that they had missed it.  I tried to tell them that Pavarotti was not the best singer in the cast and they had good reason to stay, but they left in disgust and gave me their tickets, which were first tier dead center front row!  So I got to see the great Kurt Moll and Kiri te Kanawa close up.  And by Shalyapin's beard, they were good.

Kurt Moll was fantastic and for once he was able to play a stupid character without sounding too smart for the role.  This is often a problem for him when he tries to play stupid characters like Hunding, Fafner, and even Osmin.",1414627200,2,930,4.104972375690608
8492849,5,B0064S0354,"This production has been previously unavailable but is now back.  I bought it at the Metropolitan Opera Shop through Amazon.  I was very happy to have this again.  I had a VHS version in the early 90's.  Tatiana Troyanos and Kiri Te Kanawa  are in sumptuous voice and the entire production is lovely.  James Levine proves himself as a master Straussian and if you love DER ROSENKAVALIER, this is the version for you.  There are other excellent versions available but this is my favorite.  To me, Te Kanawa in her prime is the loveliest of of all Marschallins.  You won't be sorry.",1373068800,,580,4.607843137254902
8492850,5,B0064S0354,"A lush and lovely presentation of this opera!  I have loved the music for 50 years, since I first heard it as an adolescent, and this presentation is really beautiful.  I hope to see it in the flesh someday.",1366156800,,207,4.282051282051282
8492851,5,B0064S0354,"I have seen many versions of this opera over the years, both live and in video performance.  This one has something special, something that puts it in a category above any other version I've seen.  The orchestra, the direction, the photography, the cutting, the acting, the singing of every role and I mean every role, all come together as though it is actually happening.

I have never seen Kiri inhabit a role so completely, she becomes the character of the Marschallin as though she is living it at the moment.  The same goes for Troyanos, Blegen, and Moll. Not only are they living the roles individually, but together.  It is one of those rare moments in opera  where the drama, the emotion, all feel real and totally involving.  It is a performance I will never forget, not as a bystander, but as something that became part of my life as I viewed.  Absolutely wonderful!",1363824000,2,876,4.642857142857143
8492852,5,B0064S0354,"IMO, this is a great performace of this opera, especially for DVD. Kiri, Troyanos, and Blegen are a very attractive trio to look at and their voices match their looks. Kiri and TT are near perfect, in all aspects, of their roles.  The music and orchestra are a pure joy to hear.  Years ago, I saw this opera at the Met and wound up paying more attention to the orchestra than the singers. On stage, Regine Crespin was the greatest Marschallian I ever heard. At half voice, her words floated through out the House.  I did see Kiri in this role on stage and  thought she was excellent, however, she is even better on dvd.",1358553600,2,619,4.356521739130435
8492853,5,B0064S0354,"So good to see a cast that is at their peak, an added bonus with Pavarotti. Only draw back is picture quality. NTSC is never great.",1358121600,,131,4.076923076923077
8492854,5,B0064S0354,"This is my personal favorite cast of Der Rosenkavalier. Kiri te Kanawa is in exquisite voice as the Marschallin, delivering Strauss's lovely legato lines. Tatiana Troyanos acts and sings Octavian beautifully. Judith Blegen's Sophie is well characterized and sung with beauty and enthusiasm. Kurt Moll is hilarious as the Baron. The entire production is wonderful, and I particularly enjoyed the final trio. The only minor fault I could find was the close camera angles. However, the production is outstanding and I highly recommend it!",1356912000,4,535,5.380952380952381
8492855,5,B0064S0354,"I'm a former New Yorker who began attending the Met. when I was twenty years old. I'm in my nineties now, and among all those operas, this is the one I'll never forget. The cast included Tatiana Troyanos as Octavian, Kiri Te Kanawa as the Marschallin, Judith Blegen as Sophie, and Kurt Moll as Baron Ochs. The entire cast was excellent, but Kurt Moll stole the show. His Baron Ochs was the vulgarist, cheapist,
stingyest, and funniest Ochs that ever existed. He was hysterical and his voice was wonderful.
  John Flynn
P.S. Luciano Pavarotti was an extra.",1355702400,4,555,4.711340206185567
