449446,3,6302276365,"My daughter watches this one all the way through for the most part.  It centers around Jackman Wolf playing requests on the radio.  My only wish is that a more charismatic character was the main breach between songs.  The wolf scares my daughter a little bit when he howls in the beginning.  She would prefer Elmo (although he can't be in everything!), Ernie, or even Grover.  Other than that, the songs are entertaining, and the story flows well.  It holds your interest pretty well.",1137542400,6,484,4.7023809523809526
449447,5,6302276365,My 16 month old grandson is totally captivated by this video. Not only does he come running when he hears it begin but he also hands you the remote so you can play it again.  I also find this to be very entertaining and find myself not only laughing and singing along but driving people crazy at work with the lyrics of the songs. I also recommend Sesame Street Sing Yourself Silly it gets the same reaction from both of us.,1127952000,,424,4.234567901234568
449448,4,6302276365,"I'm giving the DVD 4 stars for its inclusion of the song, ""You're Alive""!  I happen to feel that it's worth the price of the whole DVD to have this particular song.  However, the other songs on the DVD aren't quite as stellar.  As with most of the Sesame Street videos, there are one or two really good bits and then a lot of filler.  My 4 1/2 year old enjoys the rock and roll music that is all about things he's learning about in school right now. Adults will also enjoy the Mick Jagger-like muppet from the ""Cobble Stones"".  The only major disappointment is that although The Count appears on the box and on the main menu dressed in his Elvis costume, the Count clip that is included is rather lackluster and the Elvis costume is nowhere to be seen.",1115424000,9,752,4.304964539007092
449449,5,6302276365,"We own about 10-12 Sesame Street DVD's and this is by FAR the best of them!!!
The songs are great! My 5 month old loves this CD! Not just for older children. My husband and I enjoy it, as well!
I end up singing the catchy tunes at the office... an unfortunate side effect...",1068163200,8,274,4.092592592592593
449450,5,6302276365,"Parents,
My 8 year old boy loves Cookie Monster but Cookie Monster is not in this that much. But this is a very good video. This video tape is very rare. It is so rare it has a small miunte part with the Count's wife the Countess in it. If you have this video you are very lucky.",1019260800,4,279,3.8275862068965516
449451,5,6302276365,"The songs on this video are excellent kids versions of
cool rock songs.  They did a great job rendering them
for little ears - so much so that I find myself humming
the tunes myself after watching the video with the kids.
And of course, everything is visually engaging in true
Sesame Street fashion.",1010102400,12,299,4.537037037037037
449452,5,6302276365,"I first purchased it in 1990 for my first grand daughter and she loved it. Next I bought one for her to take home. When her sister came along she also loved it and now their youngest sister also loves it. Unfortunately, it finally wore out and now I can't find a new one anywhere. The video consists of favorite rock and roll song tunes with lyrics about learning different things for example The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" is called ""cooperation"". I highly recommend this video if anyone can find it.",975715200,3,505,4.622222222222222

449526,2,6302276365,"I haven't opened and viewed this video, so this review is based on the description and reason I returned it unopened.
My grandson loves Elmo and Sesame Street but most of the ones I have are only 30 minutes playing time; For us, that is not enough. I was looking for some hour long videos to play for him at bedtime. I purchased three videos that the descriptions showed to be 60 minutes playing time. When I got the DVDs, each one of the DVD covers clearly stated that they were 30 minutes playing time. So I returned all three for refund.",1242777600,,540,4.303921568627451

449528,5,6302276365,"As a rock and roller, I definately like to recommend stuff that rock and roll parents can enjoy with their rock and roll kids. The title here says it all. Rock and Roll.
Sesame Street has been the tops when it comes to rockin kid songs since the sixties man!
THE WORD IS NO song is sung by a non muppet, and a pretty cute non puppet at that. Gina, from back in the days when she was a ripped jeans wearing teenager on the show in the eighties. I like it. Holds up.
Others hold up too. MONSTER IN THE MIRROR, TELEPHONE ROCK, the Rolling Stones parody (I Cant Get No) COOPERATION  (the Mick Jagger muppet is hillarious!),  or the HIP TO BE[a]SQUARE song.
Admittedly there are quite a few missing, as I have over the past years since having a baby worked on collecting as many Sesame Street rock videos as I can... a personal favorite that is missing is the Bruce Springsteen parody Baby We were Born To Add...or the ""now I am a Cereal Girl""  or even the Alice Cooperish ""Theres 18 sandwiches and I don't know what to do""... but this is a great start, containing a dozen or so ROCK songs for kids, and I have no problem tossing in this one, cranking up the volume, and getting down with the Muppets. Cuz they know how to rock the cradle, man.
Also props to the main character here. A DJ known as Jackman Wolf (get it?) who has sort of a secret appetite for eating little piggies.",1209254400,,1376,4.224334600760456
449529,3,6302276365,"My kids love Elmo's World and other various Sesame Street DVD's.  This one just isn't one of their favorites.  It doesn't capture them, but I enjoy it.  My kids are 2 & 3 but it just doesn't keep their interest.",1198886400,,211,4.225
449530,5,6302276365,"My favourite segment on this DVD is The Telephone Rock with Jerry & The Monotones. I always loved their segments.

My second favourite is The Word Is""No""with Gina and Maria.",1173830400,,173,4.766666666666667
449531,5,6302276365,"Once again the CTW does it for the kids (fun songs) and the grownups (lots of sly pop references).

Jackman Wolf (see?) takes requests from everyone: Bert, Oscar, and (my favorite Street hottie) Gina, for whom Jackman plays both Chrissie and the Hearbeats's masterpieces ""You're Alive"" and the brilliant ""Rock and Roll Readers"" (""when we're not onstage we're likely to be/making an appearance at the library""). Other standouts are ""(I Can't Get No)Cooperation"" by... wait for it... the CobbleStones, and the ""No"" song featuring Gina and Maria.

No ABCs or counting on this one, just fun fun fun! And best of all... NO ELMO!",1168128000,4,623,4.980769230769231

449533,5,6302276365,"Years ago, when our oldest daughter was about two, we had three SS videos...Sleepytime Songs and Stories, Monster Hits and this one, Rock and Roll.  We had Monster Hits and this one in a two pack.  We wore those videos out!  All three of them are so good, and I have managed to find the other two on dvd and Rock and Roll was all I needed to complete our collection so that our two little ones could have them.  I have to admit though, that we, the parents, were very anxious to have this one again.  It is so cute and features some great songs, and lots of great characters.  The host of the radio show is a wolf, and our daughter simply loves this because she thinks it is a dog.  The songs are very catchy and it is just a fun dvd for your collection.  The three dvds I mentioned are very sentimental to me because they bring back memories of our first experience as parents and I am so tickled to have them again.  Try this one, and try the others too.  You'll love it!  Your child probably will too :-)",1146268800,8,1007,4.112820512820512
