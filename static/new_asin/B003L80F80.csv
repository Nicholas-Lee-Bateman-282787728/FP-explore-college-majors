4149958,4,B003L80F80,"better than average Audie Murphy western with more sharply defined characters than usual - plus a good script that brings freshness - and even fun - to the heavily traveled chase 'em plot

the actors help a lot - Robert Keith as the grizzled ex Civil War soldier who keeps trying to take over the posse - Rudolph Acosta as an Indian trying to be accepted - John Saxon as a soft Easterner reluctantly shoved into posse duty - Paul Carr as an eager young man handy with pistols - to name a few - somehow the script makes this diverse group interesting without making them annoying - the one notable exception is the 1-dimensional quality of the kidnapped girl as written - fortunately - the role was given over to the way-too-talented Zohra Lampert - and she brings this small part to life

the represents the type of effort that makes genre enjoyable",1350777600,6,849,4.5064935064935066
4149959,1,B003L80F80,"Watch out - this DVD is full screen, which was not the original aspect ratio of the film (probably why the aspect ratio isn't mentioned in the description).  It's also noticeably cheaper to buy it direct from Australia (try DevoteDVD).  It's a very good western; the single star's for the butchered aspect ratio of this edition.",1318809600,9,328,4.839285714285714
