1879983,5,B000096IA1,This is a document hard to watch but true. For many reasons it has not been available in full form till now.  Watch it and learn some sad facts of Africa.,1395187200,,154,3.967741935483871

  Easy to now see what Barack Obama has in mind with his social reforms he is forcing on us!",1380672000,2,124,4.083333333333333
1879985,5,B000096IA1,"The MSM and academia don't want you even to know of the existence of this movie. Africa Addio showed in LA for about six weeks in 1966 and then it vanished into hyperspace. I am a careful student of African events (and much else). This movie should make anyone's blood boil. The new title is ill advised, but the film is at least 90% as I remember it. You should definiely buy this movie. It is not what our progressive dimwits want you to believe it is.",1374105600,2,454,4.2298850574712645
1879986,5,B000096IA1,"I saw this as a 12 or 13 year old in a movie theater in the early sixties and it made quite an Impression on my young mind
things are changed somewhat in parts of Africa where this was filmed but a lot remains sadly the same, this is still a powerful
document  I recommend it !!",1366588800,,278,3.8771929824561404
1879987,4,B000096IA1,"I saw this film (Africa Addio) when it first came out, must have been on the cinema.
Just had to buy it now for reference, a real eye opener to the horrifying events happening in Africa in the early sixties.
Shame on the Pompous Brits that went and Lorded it over there, belittling the Africans and treating them like serfs.
Shame on the Africans that sought vengeance by torturing and slaying the innocent domestic animals and their own native wildlife animals.
But, and I mean but. This really happened.
I like it because it tells the truth. But it's viewing is not for everyone.
Certainly one for responsible parental guidance and advice.",1361750400,,641,4.732142857142857
1879988,5,B000096IA1,"This documentary is definately not for children or adults who
observe political articles in newspapers but may be faint to the brutality
of nature.
Africa Blood and Guts is a rare documentary of politics and war narrated
in an informative style indicative of quality ducumentary presentations
of the 1960's.
However, unlike modest television and news presentations of the last century,
Africa Blood and Guts reveals the violent outcomes which occurs when higher
civilizations integrate with tribal villages by force or by will.
This documentary also observes the savagery and intermittent warring which pervades
life in Africa.",1286150400,10,627,5.541666666666667
1879989,5,B000096IA1,"I had to view this dvd in intervals of fifteen minutes until complete. It was so in your face and accurate. It is easier to read about such debochery than it is to watch it. It made me feel the kidnapping all over again. I felt violated, raped, and less than a person. Oppression is the most devastating illness than any person can go through. This dvd brought all of the hatred to bear. I was facinated with its historical account of our beginnings in this country. African Americans should see this film and read about their history.",1279238400,10,535,4.469387755102041
1879990,5,B000096IA1,Outstanding.  Fills in some gaps for me concerning Africa in the 1960's.  Hasn't changed much.,1278892800,8,94,5.2

7989860,4,B000096IA1,"I saw this Movie at 19 and now again at sixty-nine. The slaughtr of humans and animals has never ceased in one degree or another, one country or another, in all that time. This picture stands in bold imagery against the romanced violence of Hollywood with its ""cool factor.""

Here we see the horror of actual murder where dying is ungainly, awkward, and ugly. People lie fallen in unnatural positions, rigor mortis adding to the macabre deathscape, where bodies exhibit all phases of decomposition from bloody carcuses to skeletons whole and partial.
  Animals also suffer these undignified deaths, and in their innocence appear helpless, sad, and bewildered as the greed of mankind destroys them to the point of extinction.
  One must be calloused to watch this through without feeling depressed. It effected me philosophically as well and turned me to pondering the begged question of ""why.""
  I came away feeling deeply grateful that I've been spared so many of the sorrows of man, but wondering for how long? Because this brutal and seemingly neutral expose makes one realize it isn't really a race or nation that holds these despicable qualities of character, but it seems inherent in the nature of man.
  When need, greed, fear, and opportunity open a gateway to evil, fellow man seems to be ready to enter under any guise of justification.
  That this film crew was able to get this quality a look at such intimate range took rare courage and commitment.
  This is not Mayberry, so if you only choose to see life with happy endings better forego Africa Blood and Guts and turn on the Hallmark channel.",1455926400,,1608,4.846153846153846

7989863,5,B000096IA1,"This is a stupid title someone decided on to get attention in the US market. The real title from the Italian filmakers who did it, ""Goodbye Africa,"" is much more emblematic of the content. Let me make this review short and to the point.  If you have any kind of clue about history in Africa, more specifically colonial history in the East, Central, and Southern regions, then you will likely find this documentary/film absolutely mind blowing. Partly for the incredible technical and aesthetic excellence of the filming and partly because what is captured were fleeting and dynamic and yes traumatic events happening exactly in that 1960-1965 timeframe when decolonization was unraveling in sad and painful ways in the background of the Cold War. If you don't know anything about sub-Saharan Africa but you have a true interest, this might just be a one-of-a-kind introduction that pulls you in to learn more. If you are interested in exploitation genre like Faces of Death and think ""Africa Blood & Guts"" sounds cool, you are not going to get it and you should move on.",1436400000,4,1070,4.8791208791208796
7989864,4,B000096IA1,I first viewed this film in 1967. It was a shocking introduction to the ongoing turmoil in this continent. The phography was superb for this time period. It made the subject matter that much more stark and poignant.,1434326400,,215,4.684210526315789
7989865,5,B000096IA1,What an eye opener,1431388800,,18,3.75
7989866,5,B000096IA1,"Very good documentary. Most people might feel that this is an attack on Africa but this is more of an attack on Europa.
Don't create systems and expectations that you can not control and maintain.
South Africa's should learn from this and start thinking about the expectations they are creating with the promise of nice farms, lots of money and all the social grants they are paying.
These systems only last till the rich people run out of money. Then it is Africa ADDIO",1425168000,,470,4.607142857142857

7989868,4,B000096IA1,While it has its lighter moments - such as the last of the British colonials making fools of themselves - most of the video concentrates on the gore and brutality of the emerging African nations. Most of it is not what would now be called 'politically correct' except near the end where it compares white South Africans to colonies of penguins. For those with an interest in the history of de-colonised Africa this should be useful.,1403308800,,432,4.697368421052632
