271510,5,6300248089,"Commando is, perhaps, the greatest action film of all star.  It's plot is transparent, it's characters are practically one-dimensional, Arnold's character John Matrix is totally invincible and everybody around him is  there to help or to get pulverised by him.  It is totally unrealistic,  filled with the best one liners in film history and gives 90 minutes of  pure, high octane brainless action.  There's no reason why anybody should  not buy this, it is a classic part of motion picture production.",930268800,,502,5.1234567901234565

Basically a former now retired operative's old team is being killed off one by one.  Sure enough the bad guys turn up at his remote mountain home.  They kidnap his daughter (Alyssa Milano - Who's the Boss, Chramed when older) and demand he kills the president of a South American country or they will kill her.

271735,5,6300248089,"I loved this movie! I'll never forget seeing it on video and was so delighted when I could tape it from cable back in the 1990's. Of course I own it on DVD now and it still more than holds its own even today. I so wish they had made a sequel 10 years later. It would have worked well--especially with Alyssa Milano all grown up. Maybe it could have been something similar but with Milano being more of an actual player in the scheme of things.

John Matrix is your best friend or your worst enemy. He's not a man I'd want to cross. see what happened to the fellow in the airplane! the guy got knocked out and had his neck broken just for ""escorting"" Matrix! This is a fun movie and definitely one where you can see again and again and be in awe of Arnold Schwarzenegger's tough guy persona. But he also showed wit as well. ""Do you have any carry on luggage?"" the stewardess asked, to which Schwarzenegger replies: ""Just him."" I laughed sooo hard! Later, after killing the guy he'd just insulted, Schwarzenegger says to the same stewardess: ""Don't bother my friend, he's dead tired."" Another hilarious line.

I won't go into too much detail on the movie as others have done that better than I have. Buy this on DVD and you won't be disappointed. I'm the 546th person to review this fine film.

271769,2,6300248089,"This film does not hold up well. The dialogue is even more filled with the ""I'll Be Back"" one liners than other Schwarzenegger movies, and the script lacks the relative sophistication of better Schwarzenegger films like Predator or Terminator. The action sequences are so over the top (jumping from a jumbo jet at takeoff, taking on a whole army in the final sequence) are so over the top, that rather than add to the film they make it somewhat laughable. The main plot ideas, the deadline to rescue the kidnapped daughter and thwart the political coup, are not terrible, but the execution pales to some of the better action films, both by Schwarzenegger and from 1985 - for a better experience from that year, try Silverado, Witness, or even the original Fright Night. Or try Terminator from 1984 or Predator from 1987, all are more highly rated than Commando and hold up much better after 30+ years.",1500422400,,901,4.745222929936306

271777,5,6300248089,"I've said it before:  growing up, I never understood the fascination other guys had with the movies of Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone, et al.  After all, nothing...and I do mean nothing could stop (or harm) these guys in their varied art house (right...) films. Even Batman and Superman (!!) had tougher times with ""the bad guys"" on the big screen than these aforementioned gentlemen.

Still, as the actors get older, and I get older, I have come to not only like all of these guys a lot...I really enjoy watching their varied--but inherently same--1980s action movies, too. And, in most cases I am watching these for the first time...so it's like I have a smorgasbord of brand new, kick-a** entertainment to view. Not too bad a deal.

Man, the 1980s must have been a fun decade...I was around, just wish I had been older...

***************

I've been buying Arnold Schwarzenegger's films ""left and right,"" lately. I've been wanting to view Commando for a couple of months...and finally got around to do so this past weekend...

...now, having viewed it...let's get right to it:

Spoilers Ahead...like it even matters

Commando stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired Army Special Forces ""Commando"", Col. John Matrix (whoa...). We are intoduced to ""AS's"" character with several shots of his muscular body before the camera finally settles on the entire package. Now, I have to tell you, I am as heterosexual as one can possibly be...but this intro even got me hot.

In a nutshell, here's what Commando is about: Arnold, er, John Matrix, is retired from the service and now lives a peaceful, idyllic life (in the Pacific Northwest?) with his daughter, Jenny (Alyssa Milano).

However, several members of Matrix's old army unit have been murdered...and Jenny is about to be kidnapped, too. It seems some South American mercenaries--led by their ex-President (and) dictator of fictional ""Val Verde"", Arius (Dan Hedaya), want to have him--Arius--restored to power...and Arnold is the only man for the job: Arius wants him to assassinate Val Verde's current president...or he'll kill Jenny.  Arnold, with no other choice--and with his old unit wiped out--accepts his mission and boards a plane, along with his ""bodyguard,""  for the eleven-hour flight to Val Verde.

Briefly: However, Martix manages to escape from his watchdog/bodyguard aboard the plane with him...exit the plane without a parachute (real men don't need them)...manage to hook up with a pretty flight attendant, Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong)...track the bad guys down...take all 1000 or so--single-handedly!!--of Arius' men out...and then also take out Arius...plus his monster of a bodyguard, Bennett (Vernon Wells)...then rescue Jenny...who is okay, by the way...

...all in eleven hours! Damn!

And, it really is a lot of fun to watch. I particularly liked:

* Arnold's escape from the plane. Sitting there with his ""bodyguard,"" he proceeds to break his bodyguard's neck, request pillows and blankets for ""his friend"" because the guy's ""dead tired,"" and then exit the plane by cutting through the plane's landing hatch and dropping 100 feet or so (like it matters) into a marshy swamp. Then, completely unruffled, he calmly sets his watch's timer to 11 hours, and goes to work.

 As luck would have it, back at the airport, one of Arius' men, Sully (David Patrick Kelly) is trying to get Cindy to go out with him. Cindy tells him to get lost--then gets grabbed by Arnold, who orders her to follow Sully. The two follow him to a local mall.

Matrix: These men Sully is with want me dead.
Cindy: I understand. I've only known you five minutes, and I want you dead.

* All the chaos at the mall. Cindy, ordered by Matrix to tail Sully, instead runs to a mall security officer for help. The guard takes one look at Matrix (""hiding"" behind a column) and immediately orders another security guard to get him, instead!

*The second security guard is busy flirting with a couple of girls when he receives the message*

Guard 2: Watch this, girls, I'm gonna go kick some a**.

He turns around and gets a look at Arnold...

Guard 2: (grabbing his phone) Hello, control? Send everyone we have here right now! The suspect is 6 foot 2, brown-haired, and one gigantic (hyphenated pronoun).

Now, all hell breaks loose at said shopping mall as Arnold easily takes out all of its security--plus a few unfortunate cops, too, who also try to stop him. After taking out ten security guards at one time (!)--he then makes like Tarzan and swings halfway across the mall--don't ask--to Sully's elevator. Sully, however, manages to elude him and ducks into a phone booth to hide. No problem! Arnold picks the entire phone booth up off the ground--with Sully inside!--and throws it a dozen yards or so. Sully is beaten.

Arnold, with Cindy now firmly on his side (smart girl!), takes Sully out to a cliff, holds him by the ankle (one-handed, no less) over it, and gets info on the location of Arius' compound.

He then let's go of Sully's ankle.

* The motel fight with one of Arius' men, Cooke (Bill Duke). Arnold gets Cindy to let Cooke into their motel room (it's not what you're thinking)...and thus begins a five minute brawl that ends up with the two men crashing into another couple's room with said other couple (a staple of all the Dirty Harry films) in bed, totally nude, of course (though next to nothing is shown).

* Cindy's rescuing Arnold from the police. Yes, Col Matrix gets picked up by the police, but once again, no problem! Cindy picks up a rocket launcher (never leave home without one) and takes the police van out, freeing Matrix. Actually, it takes her a couple of shots...but I won't spoil that for you. Matrix asks where she learned how to fire ""one of those"" and she replies, ""I read the instructions.""

I guess you can make this stuff up.

* The film's epic conclusion. Our two heroes find a plane--fortunately, flight attendant Cindy has been training to become a pilot!--and she flies Arnold out to Arius' remote island base where he totally wipes out all of Arius' men, including Arius, himself.

I love how he will pop a whole clip into an enemy, going one-on-one...but a quick over-the-shoulder ""spray"" will take out a dozen men or so.

 Arnold (once again) proceeds to kill Arius, and then goes to war with Bennett, as the two brawl all over the island, with little Jenny watching. After it is over, and John Matrix emerges victorious, is little Jenny scarred by all of this carnage she has just witnessed first-hand? Absolutely not. Jenny's laughing it up and her attitude is like, ""That's my Daddy!""

Our trio of heroes then fly off into the sunset thanks to pilot-in-training, Cindy. Just another day at the office for Col. John Matrix.

***************

The dvd contains only one special feature: the film's trailer. That's okay, however, cos the film itself is more than enough entertainment (and remember, it only cost around five dollars).

I do want to say, in all seriousness, that my biggest concern, content-wise, when it comes to films is the violence content. I especially do not like--and refuse to watch--torture and cruelty.  Commando has a lot of violence in it, yes, but it comes off as ""Looney Tunes violence."" At least, it did so to me. No one gets tortured, gallons of blood aren't used, and there really isn't anything too graphic shown here, either. No innocent persons die as a result of Matrix's actions...including all of the guards he brawls with at the shopping mall. This is just an over-the-top, lots of fun, action film that isn't meant to be taken seriously.

Which explains, I suppose, the lack of love from the Academy. Still...I really enjoyed it.

Thanks for reading.

In fact, I'd say it's even more enjoyable than other beloved Arnie flicks like Terminator and T2: Judgement Day. Arnie and Rae Dawn Chong make a surprisingly great team throughout the movie. On top of all the action, Arnie manages to throw in some comedy with some fun one liners like ""Don't disturb my friend. He's dead tired,"" uttered shortly after killing a man. The Blu-Ray looks and sounds good for a 30+ year old movie, but the lack of extras beyond a trailer is disappointing.

Don't get me wring, I liked this movie in the 80s and I like it still today, but I question if anyone that doesn't have a nostalgic background with this film would find it as funny and amusing as I do.

272138,4,6300248089,"Commando is a pure popcorn action movie fun.  The music is very similar to 48 hours with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy with that signature 80s Jamaican drum beat sound.  Through all its cheese the movie itself is very entertaining.  The film is way over the top especially with Arnold jumping out of the airplane scene and at the end with Arnold single handedly taking out an entire army.  But I always kind of enjoy watching this movie.  It is kind of a guilty pleasure movie where you just enjoy the ride and don't take it seriously.

Maybe it is so macho and over the top because of Rambo First Blood part 2 that came out earlier in the year 1985.  Stallone and Schwarzenegger were the top box office action movie stars at the time, and Commando felt like a movie that was trying to top Rambo 2.  It was a competitive rivalry until Bruce Willis entered the ring as well with Die Hard.

Commandos plot isn't too bad, it is nice to see Arnold as a father figure doting over a young daughter it gives him more of a humanity element, the direct opposite of Arnolds most famous role as the Terminator cyborg the previous year with no feeling just robotic.  Some of the films plot seemed recycled from other films such as Firefox with Clint Eastwood.  Both movies have the star being a retired member of a U.S. Special Forces group coming out of retirement to save the day.  Arnold is a big Clint Eastwood fan so that would have made sense.

The chase scenes are very well done especially with Sully in the Porsche and Arnold in the tiny Sunbeam Alpine red car.  The film definitely has tension and suspense it doesnt have a dull moment and moves along nicely.  The showdown with Bennett we all knew was coming ""Come on Bennett, I only have one arm you can beat me""  and it offers the films best one liner.  ""Let off some steam Bennett"". I would rate Commando  4 stars, it might be totally unrealistic but it is sure fun to watch.",1472169600,,1925,4.374647887323944

272145,4,6300248089,"My favorite stupid Arnold movie of all time, as if there aren't any others, right? All of the right elements are present: Explosions, vehicular assaults, reckless driving, kidnapping, extortion, burglary, egregiously excessive expenditures of ammunition, ridiculously good and stupendously bad marksmanship, especially for automatic weapons; fistfights, knife fights, trashing of motel rooms, disruption and destruction of shopping malls, mass-beatings of security guards, destruction of public telephone booths, torture, more explosions, imaginative uses of gardening implements and steam lines for homicidal purposes, in addition to the usual Marlon Brando-like acting skills and witty and sophisticated polysyllabic dialog that Arnold is known for. Pure entertainment for guys, plain and simple. His ""egress"" from the plane and subsequent soft landing still makes me guffaw to this day! I also like the fact that the female lead also isn't a love interest - if I want to see that kind of stuff, I'd watch more chick flicks.

Rae Dawn Chong is the perfect foil for the robotic Arnold Schwarzenegger, delivering perhaps the only creditable performance in the film.

272209,4,6300248089,"This is a kind of action flick that Hollywood does not make any more. Made in 1985, Commando features an iconic action hero with great one-liners, with villains who act and speak as villains should do. There is no social commentary or message. The characteristically 1980s action movie doesnt take itself seriously and it works.

The outlandish story centers on Arnold Schwarzeneggers invincible hero John Matrix, a retired Delta Force operator who is now living quietly in a mountain cabin with his beloved daughter played by Alyssa Milano. Then, bad guys (leader Dan Hedaya and his henchman Vernon Wells) kidnap her, ordering Matrix to assassinate a certain political leader in South America.

Of course, Schwarzeneggers Matrix outsmarts them (in a most incredible way, you have to see that for yourself), and starts fighting back to get back his daughter, with the help from a feisty flight attendant played by Rae Dawn Chong. Forget the story and just enjoy watching the mayhem created by Matrix, who can wipe out a unit of soldiers with great ease. The action scenes look old-fashioned but still amusing, with Schwarzeneggers deadpan humor.

This is a kind of action movie I grew up with, and though I know this is not really the greatest action film ever made, I am still very fond of it. And not many films can make us feel that way.",1458691200,,1340,4.842794759825328

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Its taken a ludicrous seven years, with surprisingly little fanfare, but the Directors Cut of COMMANDO has finally arrived on this UK release Blu-ray disc remastered. It is rare that we get a case of truly legendary action films float through the re-release schedule for Blu-ray nowadays but my interest peaked when I  saw that this gems Directors Cut was coming out. It is not hyper when I say that possibly the following is probably the granddaddy of the action film craze, which kick-started in the 1980s. Its got Arnold Schwarzenegger, its got amazing goons being dispatched awesomely, its got mountains of pithy one-liners and its got a killing spree as long as the coastline of Val Verde and of course I am of course talking about COMMANDO.

John Matrix is a retired U.S. Special Forces Colonel and spends his retirement looking after and raising his daughter Jenny Matrix [Alyssa Milano]. One day after hearing of his former squad members being bumped off, Jenny Matrix is kidnapped by the South American dictator Arius [Dan Hedaya] and John Matrixs former colleague Bennett [Vernon Wells] threatens her life unless John Matrix carries out a political assassination. Playing along with it until he can slip away, John Matrix finds out where the dastardly pair has taken Jenny and asks himself if hes bad enough to save his own daughter Jenny. The film is loaded with hilarious and memorable dialogue, thickly delivered with Arnolds trademark stony accent. Its right up there with Predator in terms of over the top quotes, and maybe even edges it out. And when Matrix finally launches his one man attack on the bad guys compound, its an absolute massacre (81 kills), obliterating everything that moves in an orgy of squibs and fiery explosions. They never stood a chance.

Of course, your mileage may vary in your enjoyment of this special film, as it depends solely on whether you love Arnold Schwarzeneggers own brand of killer instinct and deadpan humour. It is how much you want to revel in this glorious pinnacle of that is how much you will enjoy this action packed film. Those who do will not be left disappointed. Straight out of the excess of the 1980s, COMMANDO will continue to empower disbelief in you to this day with its winning combination of 180mph insane action and unforgettable one-liners. I mean, this film has Arnold Schwarzenegger freewheeling 44 down a mountainside, combat-rolling from a planes landing gear during take-off into a swamp and duplexing a phone booth whilst a yuppie goon is inside all within the first 45 minutes! That shed scene in the final stretch with the spectacular kills contained within is worth the price of the Blu-ray alone. You have to suspend your disbelief and accept that Arnold Schwarzenegger has cheated and turned on God Mode and Infinite Ammo but it is all beautifully tongue in cheek and beautiful stuff.

For those dying to see all those amazing additional Arnold Schwarzenegger kills and one-liners that were left on the cutting room floor, prepare to be pseudo-disappointed. Sure, its brilliant to finally see the banned scenes that have been denied for such a long time with the sawblade to the neck kill. In the end, COMMANDO as an action film throws you back to that carefree decade of the 1980s of real life action super heroes with an invincible Arnold bulldozing his way through his madcap world and not batting an eyelid to the insanity, as he unloads a book full of sarcastic, in a delicious 92 minutes. The Directors Cut of the film features a couple minutes of extra exposition, and makes many small but intimate touches to the films already violent action scenes, showing more gore and lingering longer on the carnage and if youve never seen that gloriously violent buzz saw kill before. If you're willing to indulge in an Arnold Schwarzenegger spectacle, the original still holds up just as good.

The original UK cinema and video versions were censored by around 15 seconds, and removed the shots where Colonel John Matrix [Arnold Schwarzenegger] slices off the soldier's arm with the machete as well as Bennett's death to remove a shot of the pipe in his chest and the tracking shot of it sticking from his body. The 2001 UK DVD release retained these cuts and also added a further 44 seconds of distributor cuts; this was because the DVD master used for the UK release was a censored Scandinavian version. All cuts were fully waived in 2007 by the BBFC. The heavily edited 2001 UK DVD version, with a total of 56 seconds removed, was also used as the master for the initial Australian DVD release. In this version additional edits include:

01: In the opening scene, after Cooke [Bill Duke] has initially shot the man in the robe, he walks over to the body and shoots him again. This second hit has been removed.

02: When Colonel John Matrix breaks Henriques's [Charles Meshack] neck on the plane, he simply elbows him, and in the next shot, Henrqiues is already dead. The shot of Colonel John Matrix snapping Henriquess neck is gone.

03: The shot of the piece of wood sticking through Cooke's stomach is absent.

04: All close ups of the pole in Bennett's [Vernon Wells] stomach are gone.

05: During the scene where Colonel John Matrix and Cindy [Rae Dawn Chong] follow Sully [David Patrick Kelly] from the airport to the shopping mall, there is an extra scene where she asks him his name and what he does for a living.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Considering this film COMMANDO is now 30 years old, and given there are some substandard transfers of movies of similar ilk and age previously, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it looks. When you consider that on the same disc we have both the Original Theatrical and Directors Cut version, and with extras too, there is no let downs, because its a winner. With both normal 1.85:1 and 1.78:1 and widescreen cared for with the full 1080p encoded resolution image also, and it manages to breathe new life into a film you would not expect benefiting from such a transfer. Particular of interest, the extras shine and stand out more. This is a great transfer makes the bullet flashes as we cut rapidly between Arnold Schwarzenegger unloading on a hapless Arius cool-looking. Those cardboard cut-out men in that island raid sequence look faker than ever though! Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox has released this Blu-ray with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio as standard. From what I can determine, this is the same 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track from the original Blu-ray, but thats not a bad thing at all. The audio track packs the right amount of punch, with explosions rocking the subwoofer and gun shots having the perfect amount of bass. Nothing here feels weak, which for a movie that features so much gunfire is essential. As for the rear channels, we get an endless parade of gunshots, shouts, helicopter fly-bys, and yes, James Horners Jamaican steel drum centric score, that many people give the music score not much appreciation, but you cant deny its unique and somehow manages to work in its own strange way.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Mark L. Lester Theatrical Version Only]: Here we get a personal introduction from the director Mark L. Lester and informs us that he is honoured to be doing this audio commentary, and also informs us that this is his favourite film, especially out of the 28 other films he has directed and with this Theatrical Version Mark tells us that they used the original 20th Century Fox intro music that they found in the vaults of 20th Century Fox. Mark talks about all the different locations that they shot at the start of the film. Mark also tells us that Arnold Schwarzenegger had his hair styled in the certain way especially for the film and when the film was released they had a craze when all the fans of the film wanted their hair styled the same way. When Arnold chases after the bad guys with his daughter from his home, Mark praises the stunt work with the Jeep goes down into the valley below without the use of the engine. When you see Arnold doing stunt work under the plane, they had to do several runs with the plane taking off and landing to get the shots right, despite the problems they encountered and when Arnold finally landed in the water after escaping from the plane was well executed, but when you see Arnold fall from the plane, in fact that was a dummy, but if filmed today, it could not be filmed, because planes taking off and landing is far too busy and crowded. When you see the filming at the GALLERIA, they had to close it down and had to shoot over 5 nights period and they had to pay all the shops for their use and all the people you see in the GALLERIA are all extras, but we also find out that this particular GALLERIA is no longer there. When you see Arnold grab the coloured balloon item above the Mall and see Arnold swing over to the bad guy in the lift, it is in fact a smaller guy from a local circus who happened to be there for the filming and if you freeze the frame when the guy lands on top of the lift, you can see it is not Arnold. When we see the two nasty guys turning up at the Val Verde Airport, it was in fact filmed at the Long Beach Airport to look like the somewhere on a Latin American Island location. When you see Arnold arrive on the beach and puts on his combat uniform, here Arnold injured himself when he puts the big knife in the holder, as he cut his hand very seriously and had to go and get stitches and they lost a days shooting. When you see Bennett [Vernon Wells] chasing Arnolds daughter down in the boiler room, this was actually below the 20th Century Foxs Studio Film lot and they were more than pleased it was used, as it saved them a lot of money trying to find other suitable locations. When you see Bennett and Arnold really fight for real and land on the metal grating floor, they really hurt themselves, but being real troopers and professional actors, they wanted to carry on shooting that scene in the boiler room. As we get to the climax of the film, Mark L. Lester comments by saying, I really had a great time making the film and was one of the best experiences of his life and especially working with the actors in the film, particularly Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was just a dream to work with and was also a great person and everyone around loved Arnold and did a great job as an actor and definitely catapulted his career in films with is performance in this film, and also came together with the lines and worked well with the culture of the time and people picked up on different things that were said in the movie by Arnold and became part of the language of the movie and started a whole string of action adventure movies of the time, and they really popularized action films and you want to get the idea that Dawn and Arnold whether they would get together finally and get married and that was the concept and implication at the end of the film, that when the love story starts. Maybe Dawn becomes the mother and Arnold gives up his career in fighting, so the three of them at the end of the film go off as a family. The End Title song is by Andy Taylor of the British Duran Duran Group and Power Station Group and Andy Taylor came into the studio to write the Title song and Mark thought he did a great job and was a popular musician at the time and Mark says that I hope all the fans out there, enjoyed the movie and enjoyed the commentary, enjoyed the movie again as much as I did, and this is my favourite movie, you can watch this film again and again I love it and it really holds up, so thank you very much for joining me again in seeing the film COMMANDO.

Directors Cut Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Mark L. Lester: This particular audio commentary with director Mark L. Lester is exactly the same as the Theatrical Version of the film. The wording in the menu makes it sound like they are two different commentaries, but they are essentially the same audio track with this directors cut audio commentary, but have slight variations with scenes that were not in the Theatrical Version of the film.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [1985] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:53] You view three deleted scenes and the first two are Mall Aftermath and Freeze! and the third one is Bennetts Death and here you get a quick handful of one-liners improvised for Bennetts iconic death scene, where Arnold says, Let off some steam, Bennett! and this ones great for a laugh at what could have been. You can either watch them separately or alternative Play All.

Special Feature: COMMANDO: Pure Action [2007] [1080p] [1.85:1] [15:08] Here we get an introduction from people involved with the film COMMANDO and they are Vernon Wells, Bill Duke, Joseph Loeb III, Steven E. de Souza and Rae Dawn Chong. Here they all praise that it is one of their favourite film, but we also get to view excerpts from the film COMMANDO. But as a bonus we get to see behind-the-scenes filming, where we get to see Arnold Schwarzenegger talking on the set of the film. As we get into this promo of the film, we get to see the likes of Mark L. Lester [Director] talking about the film, and then we get more intimate interviews from the likes of Joseph Loeb III [Screenwriter], Steven E. de Souza [Screenwriter], Rae Dawn Chong [Cindy], Bill Duke [Cooke] and Vernon Wells [Bennett]. This was a Sparkhill Productions LLC.

Special Feature: COMMANDO: Let Off Some Steam [2007] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:18] This is basically an extension of COMMANDO: Pure Action where contributors of the film talk more about being involved with the film COMMANDO and why it has become successful and also a cult film and here we get to hear views from Vernon Wells [Bennett], Rae Dawn Chong [Cindy], Arnold Schwarzenegger [Colonel John Matrix], Steven E. de Souza [Screenwriter] and Bill Duke [Cooke] who stays silent. At the end of this special feature we read TOTAL BODY COUNT: Army of Val Verde: 0 and Army of Matrix: 81. This was a Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment Production.

Theatrical Trailer [1985] [1080i] [1.85:1] [1:50] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film COMMANDO and is a great presentation.

Finally, if you have never ever seen this wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger killing spree film before, especially with this Directors Cut, then you owe it to yourself to own this COMMANDO UK Blu-ray Release. It is so vastly different to what passes as action escapism today; you will feel like youve stepped into another world. With a great brilliant presentations of both versions of the film, the reintroduction of missing bonus features, and a beautiful case package, this is the definitive release of one of the most entertaining and influential action packed film of all time. It is not only highly sort after, but an absolutely critical addition to every lover of action film collection. I would have loved to have seen a newly produced documentary that took an extended look at the films production and maybe featured some new interviews with Arnold and company, the special features here, while short, are still entertaining enough. The film COMMANDO is still amazing for todays modern audience and the transfer from a 1985 film is near perfect. Highly Recommended!

272230,1,6300248089,"This review is not on Amazon service quality (excellent) or movie content (will continue to be one of my favourites).
This review is on the quality of the HD print. And I have some other REAL HD movies where the quality is
as expected, so I can compare. On this one what they should have done - re-digitize the analog film, to get
additional pixels for HD, and then print HD in real 2K resolution. What they did - made a copy of the previous
standard 1K definition DVD print, but it **doesn't have the additional 1K pixels**. So you think you're watching HD
content, but you don't. I compared several identical episodes between DVD and Blu-ray on the same HD-compatible
equipment, and I'm failing to see a difference: the same visible grain all over the screen, the same resolution level
of any detail in close-ups. By doing so they're shamming the market and ripping movie fans of extra money without
adding any value. THIS IS CALLED CHEATING! Shame, 20th Century Fox, otherwise venerable company.
To be consistent, I should be returning the product, but I'll keep it as it saves space on the shelve. But that's the
only reason, and it's just me. If you're looking to upgrade your Commando DVD to HD, I do not recommend this buy
as it won't give you the expected quality.",1453507200,,1272,4.583333333333333

272264,4,6300248089,"When a retired Special Forces operative by the name of John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets wind of his past soldiers being killed, he's later attacked on the grounds of his own home. He's captured and sent away on a mission to assassinate a Latin American president, and if he doesn't pull off the job, then his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) will be killed. Matrix puts together his own plan to rescue his daughter and kill everyone responsible for invading his life. -summary

One thing I can say about the 1985 action film Commando is this; like a faithful soldier, it knows exactly what its mission is, and it sets out to complete the objective. Commando starring Arnie is the living definition of pop corn chomping, brain rotting shlock. The movie knows what it wants to be and not even once does it stray off track. I was actually feeling down in the dumps today, and the sheer silliness of the film brought me back to my happy self. But for the record, this movie screams guilty pleasure.

Mark L. Lester is one director who never had a problem delivering the goods with the action. From the very beginning, the viewer is treated to plenty of cold blooded murders via shoot outs, stabbings, vehicle assault, whatever. The plot follows Matrix as he tries to rescue his daughter under a time limit, and the result is one action scene after the other until the explosive, super action packed finale. No joke, this final scene has damn near everything, guys being shot up repeatedly, killed with sharp objects, axes to the gut, machetes going *chop*, forget about it, this is an action fans cheesy wet dream with some good chuckles to top it off. The movie is 90 minutes long and it felt amazingly short.

Forget about character development, everyone is a plot device to serve in either the carnage or mass destruction. Arnie is your typical balls to the wall, cheesy lined hero, kicking a** the entire time and the hell with names; whatever you see him picking up or eyeballing, he's damn sure going to use it, and the villains are stock bad guys to the fullest. The acting is exactly what you would expect from this type of movie. I didn't think it was horrible or even bad, it was just the right fit to compliment the zany feel. The special effects were surprisingly good depicting the violence, and very little was left up to the imagination as you will see a guy shot right smack in the head. There's a good amount of gore, with one scene coming right out of left field. Those who saw the movie know what I'm talking about.

The biggest reason I enjoy Commando is because it makes no attempt towards the intellectual. It's completely turn your brain off, ridiculous absurdity, having a grand ol' time from start to finish. Flicks like this is how come Arnie became my favorite action hero back in the days. This is a movie that I recommend only to the serious action fan. If you're a fan of Arnie then even better.

Pros: No identity crisis here, straight action and cheesiness

Cons: Weak on plot, BS runs rampant (Is that a con?!)",1446854400,,3045,4.588235294117647

These days former Delta-Force operative 'Colonel John Matrix' (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a secluded life with daughter
'Jenny' (Alysss Milano) life is good.....until 'John' is told by his former commanding officer that many of his old unit have been
killed believing they will soon come for him......
'Jenny' is kidnapped by a former unit member 'Bennett' (Vernon Wells) who 'John' had-had dismissed from the service some
while back, 'Bennett' now working for a political figure 'Arius' (Dan Hedaya) who wants 'John' to kill the current President so he
can gain power in return for 'Jenny's' safety.
'John' as just 11 hours to locate his daughter, but first has to locate where she's being held, along the way he picks-up with a
at first reluctant side-kick 'Cindy' (Rae Dawn Chong)
As is often the case with movies such as this there is a measure of humour along the way coupled with a series of one-liners,
including of course - 'I'll Be Back'
The film has many exciting and often explosive action sequences -'Arnie-Style'
The disc harbours both the Theatrical-Version and The Directors Cut....Good Blu-ray upgrade....can certainly recommend owning this.

Matrix had 11 hours to save Jenny.  During those hours he tracks down two of Arius's minions and kills both.  From them he learns the location of the island Jenny's held.  Then he robs a military surplus store for supplies, and flies out to the island.

Once on the island he plants explosives on building, quietly eliminates some soldiers.  Once Matrix was discovered, all Hell Breaks Loose.  Matrix was a one man army, shooting and blasting his way through a small legion of Arius's guards.  The final battle was a knife fight between Matrix and Bennett.

272300,4,6300248089,"Commando Director's Cut is definitely the best way to view and enjoy this 80s action flick. This baby is filled to the brim with testosterone fueled 80's Schwarzenegger: the one-liners are terrific, the body count is off the charts, and the arsenal that Schwarzenegger assembles is second-to-none! While this movie has long been reduced to a cult-like status, it is now receiving a terrific and definitive release that it has so long deserved.

I won't go into the intimate details of this movie for obvious reasons: if you're reading this review you probably already have the movie in some form. The film looks and sounds great, and the packaging is also pretty cool too. This edition offers some enticement for fans to want to pick this up, and Im actually quite glad that I replaced my old VHS with this. This package includes the original theatrical release from 1985, while restoring roughly 90 seconds of clips that were trimmed to squeeze the movie back into an R rating. This inclusion is interesting, but it doesnt really add a whole lot in respect to plot or storyline. The film also includes the directors audio commentary, three scenes that were deleted and for some reason not put back into the film, and some other featurettes and galleries.

If you're a Schwarzenegger fan or just a 80s action flick junkie, then this movie is a must see. Id probably recommend the Blu-ray edition by now, but this is equally a good spot to start with.",1435968000,,1450,4.75

272335,5,6300248089,"From the moment you see Matrix stomping through the forest with what would realistically be about an 800lb log on his shoulder, this movie just gets better.  With one liners like ""Why don't they just call him Girl George?"", I can't imagine the genius of the writers to come up with stuff like this. When I turned 15, my parents asked me what I want to do for my birthday, I told my mother I want to see Commando.  My mother and step father reluctantly took me and I've never been the same.  That October night in 1985 was perfect.  There was hardly anyone in the theater and they had the volume turned up so loud that my parents were both holding their ears and wanted to complain to the manager about it.  I've since watched this movie at least 40 or 50 times learning something new every time, like the cable that you can clearly see Sully hanging from over the cliff, that I simply don't care about, or the Porsche that is almost completely totaled when it crashed only to have Arnold do his magic and flip it back, after which the paint and bodywork is 100% perfect.  Rae Dawn Chong is the perfect woman, so very hot  and eager to help after she finally surrenders to the whole situation.  The only thing missing is part 2.  True Commando fans know what part 2 is.  It was written and morphed into Die Hard (yes true story)...anyways, this movie has absolutely everything to offer unlike 99% of the movies out there these days.",1422748800,,1431,4.386363636363637

272340,5,6300248089,"A brutish, brainless and thoroughly enjoyable guilty pleasure fave of mine since it first muscled into theaters back in 1985. Arnold plays John Matirx, a retired black ops army colonel. Matrix is your basic one-man army, who also takes time to crack wise while he's cracking skulls & spines. This flick almost single-handedly set the tone for action movies from the mid-80's until... well, it's pretty much still going strong. You know the kind of film I'm talking about: massively-muscled, sweat-shiny macho type performs practically impossible physical feats under extreme duress, yet always pauses the over-the-top action just long enough to dole out a few smart-ass one-liners while dishing out the punishment or, occasionally, while being on the receiving end of a brutal beating. COMMANDO pretty much blueprinted this type of film.

A very young and endearingly cute Alyssa Milano plays Jenny, Arnold's precocious young daughter. (Who knew then what a beautiful woman she'd grow up to be?) Dan Hedaya gives an amusing performance in a small but pivotal role as the cold, calculating, mouthful-of-marbles foreign dictator General Arius, who needs Arnold's help in order to return to power in the postage stamp-sized nation of Val Verde. To this end, Hedaya sets into motion a complex series of events that culminate in the kidnapping of Arnold's daughter. This is done to guarantee the retired soldier's full cooperation. (Yeah right!) The lovely Rae Dawn Chong has a terrific leading lady role as Arnie's ditsy, unwitting ""partner in crime"" whom he must initially force to aid him in his quest to get his daughter back safely. As the film progresses, Rae Dawn shows us that she has what it takes to stand side-by-side the 'Austrian Oak,' helping deliver him & his deadly payload to a small island off the coast of California where Arnie's terrified daughter is being held hostage. Quite a bit heavier than when he played 'Wez' in 1982's incredible Aussie post-apoc masterpiece, The Road Warrior, Vernon Wells gives us yet another scenery-chewing performance as a nutcase former member of Arnie's black bag team. Meanwhile, big Bill Duke plays an icy ex-Green Beret working for the bad guys, who has a memorable, motel room-destroying confrontation with Arnold. (Schwarzenegger was reportedly so impressed by Duke's performance that he suggested him for a similar role in the following year's sci-fi/action mish-mash megahit, PREDATOR). Shrimpy weasel extraordinaire David Patrick Kelley (48hrs, Dreamscape) plays the wonderfully wormy go-between, Sully, who gets a terrific death scene (""I let him go""). Oh, and keep your eyes peeled for a quick bit part by a young Bill Paxton as a miffed Navy radar officer who tries to warn Rae Dawn & Arnold to steer their 'borrowed' amphib plane clear of a restricted Naval gunnery range, when the pair are en route to the General's island stronghold for the rousing finale.

Okay, so I won't even try to deny that COMMANDO is rather silly and absurd, but it's also a heckuva lot of fun! The red, white & blue patriotism that was running rampant during the heydays of the Reagan Administration is on full display here. Ahhnald joined the ever-growing assembly line of 1980's-era lone warrior types who charged headfirst into action to win... well, whatever war needed winning. Schwarzenegger's John Matrix proudly earns his place alongside Stallone's John Rambo and Chuck Norris' James Braddock, et. al. As far as action movies go, COMMANDO has everything you'd expect in a mindless action flick, and then some: an impressive body count (92 confirmed kills in a brief 90 minutes); bone-crunching beatings in between the noisy shoot-outs and some creatively excessive bits of hand-to-hand combat violence during the film's bloody, bullet-riddled climax; a highspeed car chase; a screaming gal bouncing her big gazongas all over the place; the requisite slimy lead bad guys; HUGE leaps in logic, plot holes & convenient coincidences galore; a thumping rock music closing credits tune (""We Fight For Love"" by Power Station). WHEW! You name it, COMMANDO just about has it all - except maybe a nuke at the film's climax. Most action films in this vein typically have a few slices' worth of cheese in them. By comparison, COMMANDO is a 50lb brick of Velveeta. ;-)

The Director's Cut adds a minute or two of footage back in. Most of it is in the form of extended gore during the end assault sequence but there's completely different version of Jenny Matrix's sassy comeback to the greasy dictator character (the director's cut take has more shock value I suppose, but nothing to justify re-shooting it with the take we saw in theaters), and lastly, a brief bit of exposition from Matrix reflecting on his secretive military career which, (for reasons I cannot fathom, since the entire speech lasts, like, 30 seconds), was originally left on the cutting room floor. The film looks pretty good on DVD. The colors are crisp & bright, the detail and camera moves are smooth for the most part, with very little pixelation or artifacting. The audio thunders during all the right places and thankfully the corny dialogue doesn't get drowned out by all the explosions and gunfire. There's a director commentary (theatrical cut only, for some strange reason), deleted scenes and some retrospective goodies, too.  All-in-all this version of COMMANDO is a pretty solid value. I know will be upgrading to Blu-ray one of these days. I'll update this review with my impressions of the A/V presentation on that particular version when I do. 5 STARS for this silly but entertaining assault on your senses. No one did it quite like Schwarzenegger.",1420848000,,5668,5.078326180257511

which adds an extra 1-2mins of violence & Gore into the film

now 20th century fox has now released this on blu-ray, but barebones, no extras at all carried over from the dvd release
which i think is a big insult
the films duration on the blu-ray says 90mins but no idea if it's the UNRATED cut or the R rated
there's no mention on the back cover about it so it's confusing
so don't bother buying this new blu-ray release, Disgusting effort by 20th century fox
However the U.K. branch of 20th century fox has released both versions Theatrical cut & Unrated cut on 1 Disc
plus all the special features from the Directors cut dvd have been carried over
it's called Commando 30th Anniversary edition blu-ray go to amazon uk check for yourself
plus the U.K. blu-ray is ALL REGIONS which means the HD transfer & 5.1 master mix is from the U.S. blu-ray
only Difference is the U.K. branch included both versions of the film with all the extras carried over
very stupid of the U.S. branch not to do the same

With this purchase I got a digital copy from Amazon which is great but I prefer iTunes

This a a review for the Blu-Ray copy

This is a great movie from 1985 your typical they took my daughter and I am going to kill all of you.

Video Quality:
While this 1080p, 1.85:1 image found on Commando will never compare to the best transfers I've seen, it nevertheless looks marvelous when taken by itself, compared only to the previous VHS and DVD versions of the movie. Commando is like an old friend, a broken-in baseball glove or a favorite recliner, something that I'm always more than happy to spend time with. It's safe to say that I know this movie fairly well, and the image presented on this Blu-ray is a revelation. I'm simply amazed by how much this movie benefits from a high definition, 1080p transfer. Sure, there are some problems, but Commando will never be five-star material on Blu-ray or any future format for that matter. The source is over twenty years old but aging rather well, but not as refined and polished as movies of more recent vintage. There are some minor speckles on the print, grain is almost always present and spikes in certain scenes, and the image appears a bit soft every now and again, but for the most part, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Detail is much higher than I expected it to be, as was clarity and definition. Colors are rich and clearly defined, though somewhat pastel in appearance, but that's just the way movies looked in the late 1970s and 1980s (Dawn of the Dead comes to mind as a movie with similar-in-appearance colors). Nighttime scenes sport surprisingly good black levels. The 1080p transfer highlights a few blue screen effects as plainly obvious, notably when Matrix and Cindy take off in the sea plane. My meager expectations for this disc were far surpassed, and I'm simply impressed.

Audio Quality:
Fox's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track blew me away, and it was like hearing Commando for the first time. Much like the video, this is a revelation, a completely engaging, powerful experience. Like the video, it doesn't live up to the extremely clean, immersive, and realistic bars set by the best tracks I've heard, but this one makes for an absolutely perfect compliment to the feel of the movie, and impressed me as much as any other track out there, all things considered. May of the ""problems"" are more a result of the source than the disc. Some of the sound effects are pretty dated, like when Cooke drives the car through the showroom window at the beginning, but it's a fun sounding effect anyway, just like the movie. We get the same experience, only about 100x more powerful, when Matrix drives a dozer into the surplus store. James Horner's score is iconic and fantastic, definitely product of the 1980s (a lot of saxophone and synthesizer beats), and an overall entertaining listen. Surround channels work hard too, and there always seems to be something happening, be it a fly-by of a helicopter early in the film, loud, heavy gunfire, or the almost nonstop music. Arnold's punches and kicks pack quite a punch, resonating with hard-hitting, authoritative goodness. It's a cacophony, but it woks very well anyway. Gunshots reverberate and punch you in the gut, rattling the subwoofer and emanating all around the listening area. A scene in chapter 5, where Matrix is chained to a table, sounded a bit awkward, as if a breeze was blowing by, sounded more like undefined noise than wind. A minor quibble, and maybe its there by design, but it sounded a bit awkward anyway. I was most entertained and impressed by the mix, and like the video, the lossless sound mix far, far surpasses the downscaled, very weak in comparison mixes of the VHS and DVD versions I've heard countless times.

272379,4,6300248089,"""Commando"" (1985) was one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's early action flicks, featuring what would become his standard mix of comic book heroics and deadpan humor.  Schwarzenegger plays Colonel John Matrix, a retired Delta Force commando, whose daughter (a young Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped and held hostage by a former comrade-in-arms turned mercenary, who wants to ensure Matrix stays out of a planned South American military coup.  The effort to put Matrix on ice fails, and the angry commando is soon on the trail of the kidnappers.  He will be helped by a young airline stewardess and novice pilot (Rae Dawn Chong) as he races the clock to find and storm an island fortress to rescue his daughter.

For die hard fans of Schwarzenegger's movie, ""Commando"" is a big bowl of popcorn, with lots of fights, gunfire, and what were at the time pretty good special effects, along with plenty of humor and some stagey dialogue.

272384,5,6300248089,"Long before DOOM changed the videogaming world by providing us with the image of a crazed soldier mowing down legions of hell-sent demon spawns with a chaingun, Arnold Schwarzenegger did just that in COMMANDO, arguably the greatest of all the ""one man army"" movies of the 1980s. How did this bloody gem come into being? Well, to this day I can almost imagine some demented screenwriter hacking away at a typewriter in a smoke-filled room, muttering: ""I've slashed the plot...thrown out all sense of realism...reduced the dialogue to a series of one-liners...WHAT MORE CAN I DO?""

What more, indeed?

COMMANDO is the story of John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a retired special ops guy who evidently spends 23 hours a day in a weight room when he's not playing single daddy to his daughter, played by a pre-tween Alyssa Milano. Everything's hunky-dory in Matrix's remote cabin until a platoon of bad guys shows up, kidnaps his daughter, and try to blackmail Matrix into one last job -- the assassination of some banana republic el presidente. Unfortunately for the bad guys -- played with tremendous relish by such staples of 80s films as Dan Hedaya, Vernon Wells, David Patrick Kelly and Bill Duke -- Matrix has no intention of killing el presidente. Instead, he wants to kill all of them, and for the next 90 odd minutes that's precisely what he does, in between forcing the ubiquitous Rae Dawn Chong to serve as his unwilling assistant, throwing out barbaric one-liners over the smoking corpses of his victims, and pausing momentarily to check his watch. Notice I didn't say ""pause to reload"" because, damn it, not only does Matrix ""eat Green Berets for breakfast,"" he's also pretty much immune to mortal conundrums which would present us with difficulty -- you know, things like bullets and gravity and stuff. Watching this movie gives one the strange masculine sense of satisfaction which occurs when you explode a frog with a firecracker or feed a two-by-four into a circular saw. It's simply the pleasure of mindless destruction, set to a cheesily wonderful 80s soundtrack.

The moral lessons of COMMANDO are those of the decade that spawned it, to wit: might makes right, bullets only hit bad guys, and there is no problem with a machine gun, high explosives and a HUGE killing knife cannot solve. As for the violence, it's a character in itself and makes up for the paper-thin plot and utter lack of any kind of believeability. It took Jason Voorhees ten or twelve hockey-mask wearing sequels to do what Ah-nold does here in under two hours. From the smug blackmailer who gets a bullet between the eyes for daring to say to Matrix, ""So you have to do what we want, right?"" (answer: ""Wrong."") to the pint-sized kidnapper who gets hurled off a cliff after being humiliated via the classic line, ""Remember when I told you I was going to kill you last? I LIED!"", to the unfortunate mercenary who gets his scalp sawed off with a gardening tool, this movie is a fellowship of death, right up until the moment he impales the Gay Pirate on a steam boiler (after electrocuting him) and barks, ""Let off some steam, Bennett!""

Army? We don't need no stinking Army. We've got JOHN MATRIX.

It must be said that everything about this movie is awseomely bad, and the worse the movie gets, the awesome-er it becomes. Arnold, fresh of triumphs in CONAN and TERMINATOR, is near his cigar-chewing, throat-slitting, single-entendre-spewing best here. So is Vernon Wells, the baddie from THE ROAD WARRIOR who has the misfortune to have to fight a bare-chested Arnold while wearing a tight chain mail shirt that serves mainly to remind the audience that his workout routine probably included lifting plates of donuts off the craft services table in between slugs of Foster's. (What was Dan Hedaya thinking, taking on mercenaries like Wells and Duke, so clearly in need of a Stairmaster? And while we're at it, how did hiring the 5'4"" of fury that is David Patrick Kelly seem like a good idea?) Hell, even Bill Paxton gets in on the fun, though it must be said (ahem) that he doesn't actually get to kill anybody.

The 80s are an easy decade to mock The fashions were bad, the hairstyles appalling, and a lot of the pop music made you want to slam an ice-pick through your eardrums. On the other hand, and possibly because of this, such a slew of amazingly good, totally irresponsible and uber-violent films has seldom been unleashed by Hollywood like so many slavering hell-hounds. Among the best of these?

272396,5,6300248089,"Is you life empty of meaning? Have you been longing for that cinematic masterpiece that will finally 'make it all make sense' in life? Have you been feeling that your recent movie going experiences have been stuck in a cinematic rut of tired repeated sequels, spoiled liberal movie ideals about how we should get along in a world of moral ambiguity? Yes? Then this movie is the cure for all your movie ails. I don't want to spoil the plot, but this movie is to action movies that the Caveman is to modern action movies...Bigger, badder and with 1000% more biceps. It's the pro to-action movie.  In fact, at one point, Arnie takes off his bulletproof vest for a knife fight, well...because who needs armor when you've got Mr. Olympia winning abs? Only wussies that's who. And only wussies need to reload, buckle in, or think about 'how bad the terrorists childhoods were and why they were forced by heartless American policies to become terrorists, and that they are really just misunderstood. Arnie understands them just fine, and treats them accordingly.
 Watch this for:  for the large amounts of ass kicking, explosions, gunfire and unbridled 80's action movie goodness. Do not watch this for plot, clever dialogue or Woody Allen style angst. The closest you'll get is Arnold making a quip after he demolishes a bad guy. Start an evening with this, and large volumes of alcohol. You won't be disappointed. Just don't blame me when you have to crash through a wall to leave a room instead of using the door.",1404172800,2,1509,4.751908396946565

272398,5,6300248089,"""Commando"" is not the kind of film that takes itself very seriously, but when it rocks, it really rocks, and you feel the blood-and-thunder effects of a great old R-rated shoot 'em up that has now become a practical lost art in our age of cinematic CGI atrocities. When I read on Wikipedia recently that some misguided souls are plotting to ruin the film's legacy by funding an ill-advised remake of this title, I shook my head in disbelief that they intend to take a ""serious approach"" to the script. Oh sheesh, I say. (Sure, the original script was probably more serious and less Arnold-fied, but who cares? ""Commando"" is a kill 'em all movie that is fun for a reason. The filmmakers who try to make it ""serious"" are spoiling the sexist, macho, overly unrealistic structure that makes these movies fun for all guys who are still boys at heart--the point is that these are fantasies (as at ease on the SyFy channel as it is on TNT, for instance) in that they make no bones about their unbelievable elements. Is it an Oscar-worthy effort, a great movie? No. Would I rather watch it than a rerun of ""Gone with the Wind""? Sign me up!
The picture and sound quality of the movie (and the widescreen presentation) are fine, very good through a nice pair of headphones. The director's commentary (available on the theatrical cut only) is quite fun, but not as informative as I would have preferred...but then again, the movie doesn't require much thought or explanation anyway. Rae Dawn Chong is hilarious (and quite racially insensitive!) on her interview segments, whereas director Lester is also interviewed extensively on the film's two featurettes. Joel Silver apparently had a warped sense of humor (he was the one who told Black to tell those, ahem, lady jokes in ""Predator"") and his vision is thoroughly preserved on this 1985 classic. The best parts of the deluxe DVD are the deleted scenes, in which you see a longer version of the shed attack scene...watching this on TV when I was younger, I knew some stuff was drastically cut, but this is the most complete scene you'll get of this. Overall, the extras aren't all that revealing, but if you're a real fan, buy this edition, don't just settle for the old bare bones edition (which is currently going for cheap at Wal-Mart stores).

I was surprised by how good it looks.

272440,5,6300248089,"Commando is the best thing to watch to simply enjoy with some pizza or popcorn and to laugh at. Arnold Schwarzenegger puts on his usual performance of having to save someone and slaughtering anyone who gets in the way (often times with amusing one-liners), and though the story is relatively easy to follow and the dialogue certainly isn't Oscar material, it's still a very fun film to watch. It's very 80s, some of the characters are corny (such as Sully and attempts at womanizing, and the main bad guy Bennet looking like an overweight Freddie Mercury in an ill-fitting costume), and the action is definitely over the top, but that's just what makes this film enjoyable. It's so bad, it's great!

As for the Director's Cut DVD that I received, you get a few more minutes of film length, plus deleted scenes, some interesting interviews, a commentary (not with Arnold though, but with the director Mark L. Lester), and some still pictures to look through. For a film like this, it's good enough, and it's certainly better than a bare-bones DVD with just the film and subtitles.",1389657600,,1079,4.770053475935829

To find her, Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks, killers, one of his former commandos, and a fully equipped private army. With the help of a feisty stewardess (Rae Dawn Chong) and an old friend, Matrix has only a few hours to overcome his greatest challenge: finding his daughter(Alyssa Milano)before she's killed.

What killed me through the whole movie was the fake mustaches and beards. Seriously they were so bad it made the movie look like one long take of the SABOTAGE video by the Beastie Boys. I could not stop laughing it was hilarious seeing obvious white guys with epic fake mustaches and beards, and all the actual Mexican actors were clean shaven. Of course there was the usual stable of Arnold male actors in it as well. How can we forget Rae Dawn Chong, the 1980s version of Rosario Dawson, but hotter. A young cutie Alyssa Milano, and a 3 story boiler room beneath a house with metal catwalks and everything. I mean seriously when people reference 1980's action movies, this is what they are talking about: 90 minutes, bloody R rated sexy violence. What more could we want in a movie? Not much I suppose.

What is funny to me though while watching COMMANDO it made me realize just how much James Cameron purposefully references many shots from it in TRUE LIES. Great stuff.

272677,3,6300248089,"After sitting through that miserable rubbish ""House of the Rising Sun"" starring Dave Batista, watching ""Commando"" is like a breath of fresh air. Granted, this is still a very stupid movie, filled with plot holes large enough to drive an eight-wheeler through them, stock villains (a South American dictator) and continuity errors by the dozen (a Porsche that miraculously repairs itself after getting rolled over). But it's got two things that ""Rising Sun"" didn't have: a sense of humor and an embrace of its own stupidity. It's also got the king of all macho muscle-bound superheroes, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Everyone who watches the movie knows the plot: South American mercenaries have kidnapped John Matrix's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) and are forcing Matrix to carry out a political assassination on a US leader to start a revolution. To make matters worse, one of the bad guys is a turncoat from Matrix's Delta Force team named Bennett (Vernon Wells), who matches Matrix in terms of mental AND physical prowess. Needless to say, Matrix is pissed and will use his brains, muscles and, of course, a buttload of weapons to take the bad guys down.

Yes, I know the plot is simplistic and very stupid but this is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, not a European art-house movie dealing with human conditions. The important question is ""Is this movie fun despite the stupidity?"". The answer is resounding YES. I understand it's impossible how Arnold could survive jumping off an airplane a hundred feet above the ground and blow up a weapons store without anybody noticing but to quote Stephen Prince in his book, ""A New Pot of Gold"", Schwarzenegger's movies are ""live-action cartoons"", in which Schwarzenegger winks at the audience, knowing that all of this is not meant to be taken seriously and that he is in on the fun.

Schwarzenegger is definitely having fun here, bulldozing through these enemies like they were nothing, cackling witty one-liners (""Let off some steam, Bennett"". ""He's dead tired"". ""I eat Green Berets for breakfast and I am very hungry"". ""I let him go"".) and causing more destruction than Godzilla and King Kong combined. And when he's having fun, we the audience are having fun, which is important. Compare this to what Batista was doing in ""House of the Rising Sun"". In that movie, Batista was getting beat up by a bunch of pint-sized minions one-on-one, running like a pansy and constantly getting out-acted by scantily clad valets. Sorry but seeing a 300-pound muscle-bound wrestler get creamed constantly when he can easily destroy his enemies made my stomach turn. On the other hand, seeing Schwarzenegger say ""como esta?"" before taking down an enemy provides nothing but grim satisfaction.

This is a satisfying action movie, one that goes for the gut and the funny bone, if not the brain. ""Commando"" may not endear itself to intellectuals but for many people who just want a good dose of mindless, entertaining fan, this movie will whet your appetite.

Recommended, especially if you want to turn your brain off.",1346544000,,3070,5.035433070866142

272721,4,6300248089,"The 80's were an ultra-violent era, when the proliferation of cable TV, and the growth of the home video market, helped fuel the popularity of action films, which continued to ramp up the level of violence.  A sketchy plot wasn't an obstacle, as long as the movie featured tenacious over the top action, prodigious gunfire, and lots of things blowing up and on fire.  With an extremely simple premise, and a story with scant ties to reality, Commando (1985) is a prototype from this genre, where you simply turn off your critical brain, and just enjoy the humor, violence, and mayhem.  Commando was a huge box office smash, and along with movies like Rambo: First Blood Part 2 (1985), helped established the prototype that countless 80's action movies would attempt to copy.

For bodybuilder turned actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Commando was his first film as the headline star, and one of his first with a significant speaking role.  Although most are now familiar with Schwarzenegger as an action hero, this was the genesis of his transition from roles like Conan the barbarian and the Terminator.  Deliberately light on story, and moving at a fast pace, the film focuses on showcasing action, with fights and car chases, serving as the preamble to an all out assault, and total devastation of an island stronghold.

Schwarzenegger plays Colonel John Matrix, living in at a remote house in the wilderness with his young daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano).  Arias (Dan Hedaya), a dictator type looking to assume control of a Latin American nation, abducts Matrix and his daughter, and orders him to assassinate the current president, or his daughter will die.

On a plane bound for Latin America, Matrix kills his escort, and escapes during takeoff.  Still at the airport, he recruits Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), a flight attendant, to help him trail Sully (David Patrick Kelly) one of Arias' gang.  Soon Cindy becomes fully committed to the operation, as the pair discovers that Arias' headquarters is on an island.  Cindy flies a borrowed amphibious plane to the island.  Matrix departs in a raft, reaches shore, and all hell soon breaks loose.  The body count soars, as Matrix employs all manner of weaponry, including garden tools, in the attempt to rescue his daughter.  Bennett (Vernon Welles), a former member of Matrix's command, is his final and most dangerous adversary.

Like a comic book, the film consists of a series of impressive action sequences, loosely strung together.  The minimal story development is of little consequence, as for the first time, Schwarzenegger truly shines as a star.  While lacking polish and sophistication, he has a unique appeal that goes beyond being one of the most physically imposing screen presences ever.  Those one-liners may be dumb, but you still love them.

Things are lively and visually stimulating, as the action includes hand to hand combat, car chases, full-auto fire, rockets and heavy explosives.  The supporting characters may be mostly one dimensional, but the cast delivers what is required.  A young Alyssa Milano does a nice job, while Bill Duke (Predator) and Vernon Welles have the best fight scenes with Arnold.  Rae Dawn Chong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quest-for-Fire/dp/B00003CXAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quest for Fire</a>) might seem an unlikely partner for Schwarzenegger, but the combination works better than you might expect.  Cindy does a lot of unbelievable things, but at least they don't try to turn her into a soldier.

With all the dramatics and realism of a professional wrestling match, the film's exciting and uber-violent finale is precisely the kind of fantasy that characterizes this genre, as Matrix receives only a few minor wounds, while destroying the enemy force, and saving his daughter.  Flying away from the island, as ""We Fight For Love"" by The Power Station plays through the credits, Arnold Schwarzenegger had truly arrived, and was on the road to superstardom.",1337126400,,4000,5.220657276995305

A man hurries to take out the garbage and gets a shocking surprise. We see a small fishing boat leave its dock, then an unexpected event happens. Next we see a small house in the California hills. A man talks to his ten-year old daughter. ""I love you too."" A small helicopter lands with a Major General Kirby. ""Got a warrant?"" asks Ginny. John's men are being killed, there was a leak. There is a sudden attack! Ginny hides in her bedroom, but the villains kidnap her. Her Dad pursues them with a sabotaged truck. But he is captured by Bennett. They explain what they want Matrix to do in order to save Ginny. ""I'll be back."" A pillow and a blanket are useful on a plane. Matrix knows the insides of this airplane. Now he has eleven hours to accomplish his mission. A man lights a cigarette, will this be bad for his health? Follow that yellow car! ""Trust me."" [Is his request believable?]

There is a fight with the security guards, then shooting in the mall. [Nobody screams or panics?] What is going on? There is a car chase for action. [No seat belts?] What about a car? Can Ginny be rescued? Matrix finds the place and brings Cindy in. They find information about fuel for an old amphibian plane. Next a shopping trip at a closed store. ""Wow!"" This self-service shopping is ended by the police. Cindy learns something new (she read the instructions). ""Here we go!"" ""Well done."" They are detected, and warned about the gunnery range. They land by that island. Matrix suits up for his mission, then views the buildings. [Note the eucalyptus trees.] There are shots and explosions, then more shots and explosions. Cindy calls General Kirby. Ginny wanders away. Matrix holds off scores of enemy soldiers who charge him only to be killed.

The skills and luck of this lone warrior seem unbelievable. [Its only a movie.] Bennett stalks Ginny in that cellar. There is the usual conversation between the villain and John before their fianl hand-to-hand combat. The good guy wins in the end. [What else?] Army helicopters arrive after the battle is over. ""Leave anything for us?"" What about next time? ""No chance.""

This movie has some comic scenes before its ritual of combat killings by an indestructible warrior. The story is the framework to justify the combat, which is almost comical in its one-sided victories. Could a foreign ruler have a small army on an island off the California coast without attracting the attention of Federal authorities? Where is Homeland Security? The victory of a good man over scores of villains is an exaggerated morality tale. Were the actors chosen to draw the largest possible audience?",1330300800,,2642,4.73695652173913
272726,3,6300248089,"Yep, what you see in the title above is an actual line from this movie. When I was a kid, I loved watching Arnold's movies, and ""Commando"" was no exception. I first saw it on VHS about 20 years ago, and it blew my impressionable young mind, to be sure. I just caught the movie again on T.V. last night, and it's incredible how bad it is... yet it still retains a quirky charm that defies its poor production values.

In terms of plot, ""Commando"" seems like it was written by a ten-year-old boy for a fourth grade writing assignment. The story is utterly absurd... it includes a female flight attendant who somehow manages to masterfully operate a rocket launcher (with no training, mind you). It also includes a laughable villain (Bennett) who wears a tank top made of chain mail for the entire movie... yes, a CHAIN MAIL TANK TOP! Do you need more evidence of the follies of the 1980s?

At one point, Arnie wants to stop an enemy from placing a phone call. Instead of opening the door to the phone booth, HE PICKS THE ENTIRE THING UP, ripping it from the wall, and throws it on the ground, with the enemy still inside! Did the writers theorize that John Matrix (Arnold's character - great name) was not strong enough to open the door, but he WAS strong enough to lift the whole booth over his head?

Undoubtedly, the most absurd part of the plot is when Arnold infiltrates the base of an evil dictator, and single-handedly kills his ENTIRE private army of 200 soldiers. What makes this point even funnier is the fact that earlier in the movie, they point out that this private army is made up of professional mercenaries and former special operations members... and yet not a single one of them can hit Arnold with a rifle as he traipses through wide open spaces, shooting baddies at his leisure J

Yes, ""Commando"" is terrible, but it's so bad that it's kind of good. It has not aged nearly as well as his classics, such as the ""Terminator"" series, ""Conan"", and ""Predator"", but it certainly has its merits. If you grew up watching Arnie's movies in the 1980s, like I did, you'll probably get a kick out of revisiting ""Commando"".

272796,4,6300248089,"Let me just get one thing out of the way first...if you take this film seriously then you are COMPLETELY missing the point.

Between Terminator and Predator big Arn made another one-word tough-guy action film that delivered what it promised and then some. Commando is almost tailor-made for Arnie's style of over-the-top action. In fact, I wouldn't say that this film goes over-the-top as much as I would say it launches into the stratosphere, powered by utterly implausible action, corny-as-hell one-liners, a ludicrous plot, and the campiest, least-threatening villain in movie history.

Arnie plays John Matrix (yeah, you really did read that correctly) an East-German defector and retired Special Forces Operative (at the age of 37!) who only wishes to live a life of peace with his daughter Chenny in a cozy cabin on Mount Baldy, California (the kind of place you'd expect Larry David to live). Trouble arises when Cooke (the incredible stoic Bill Duke) an emotionless hitman, starts knocking off Matrix's former comrades. It's all just a ruse to lure him out of hiding and snatch his daughter, a plan 'masterminded' by Bennett, Freddie Mercury's twin brother and the man Matrix kicked out of his unit because 'he enjoyed killing a little too much'.

Matrix's mission is to fly out to Val Verde and kill the democratically elected President that he himself helped to install after overthrowing Arius (Dan Heydaya) a brutal dictator. With Chenny being used as blackmail, Matrix has no option but to go along with the plot. But he'll be back sooner than you think as he's the kind of guy who just exits a plane during mid-take-off. After dragging Cindy, an easily excitable flight-attendant (Rae Dawn Chong), along for the ride Matrix pummels his way through Bennett's henchmen and Arius' piss-ant soldiers one by one, hoping to find Chenny before the plane lands in Val Verde.

There's little in this film that makes sense (such as how could a brutal dictator be exiled to an island just a few minutes of the California coast and the Pentagon NOT know about it? and Why is every one of Arius' piss-ant soldiers the same man in a hat with a fake mustache and gun?) but I'll be damned if it's not entertaining. Almost everything Bennett says is a one-liner for the ages. And don't get me started on the sub-text! He basically kidnaps Chenny (and does the job for free) because he's jealous of her. And if you just listen to his hysterical final confrontation with Matrix, and turn your head away from the screen...tell me that DOESN'T sound like a man-on-man love scene. It honestly would not surprise me if footage of Bennett was played on a constant loop on giant screens in gay night-clubs.

James Horner's score is also utterly brilliant, almost never stopping from start to finish, thundering the action along with sharp, punchy strings, eccentric saxophones, and upbeat, funky steel drums. This is truly one of Horner's best efforts, forget Braveheart or Titanic and hunt down the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000LMXDEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>&nbsp;score CD.

Mark L. Lester's career sort of withered away after the 80s, but this movie is certainly his crowning achievement and helped solidify Arnie's reputation as an endlessly likeable, bigger-than-life movie star. There have been talks of a remake directed by David Ayer and starring Sam Worthington (the names attached at the time of writing). They want to make it more gritty and serious apparently. Are you kidding me? Making Commando more gritty and serious is like adding ketchup to custard in order to make it 'more of a dinner'. It just won't work. And besides, 20th Century Fox virtually remade Commando in 2007 with the dull John Cena flick The Marine (they really stretched their imagination when they came up with THAT title), further proving that a remake is a stupid idea.

The Blu Ray looks above average in 1080p 1.85:1. It was one of the first Blu Rays Fox released and I wish they put a bit more effort into it (it doesn't even feature the Director's Cut, which which came out on DVD at the same time. The DTS HD-MA soundtrack highlights some of the more dated elements of the sound design (plain old Dolby Stereo A) but is otherwise passable.

It has oodles of action and homo-eroticism for straight and gay men alike; not to mention its tendency to impregnate unprotected female viewers.

No needless romance, no filler subplots, just an hour and a half of what Arnold Schwarzenegger (at his prime) does best: showing off his enormous biceps, uttering the most impressive collection of memorable one-liners ever contained within any of his works and literally annihilating a small army of bad guys. From beginning to end, this movie is hilariously awesome and an absolute must for anyone with a set of testicles.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I think it looked pretty good, except i see they have used some noise reduction to erase the film grain. I didn`t like that. Fortunately, i saw they didn`t erase all tbe grain. I liked how the colours looked good.

Audio Quality: 4/5

For the most part i think it sounded good, except at the end when Arnold used his machine gun and another automatic rifle. I expected those guns to have more bass. I think they hardly had any bass. It`s a pity. I think the dialog in the Center speaker at times sounded too low. My subwoofer was used a lot in this film. The many explosions sounded good in my ears with the deep bass.

I also think the punches and kicks in the fight scenes had good bass. If i remember correct, the other times he used guns, i think it had nice bass. The Rear speakers are mostly used the action scenes, but are used at other time also. Like when there is music, helicopters and such. Like i mentioned at the start, except for some of the weapons that he used which i think had too little bass, and some of the dialog was too low, i think it was a good DTS-HD MA 5.1 remix.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is the perfect man for the role, and the brutal devastation he rains down on his adversaries is as righteous as it is entertaining.  After Arnold left hollywood, the only GREAT action films I've come away from a theater with my money's worth are perhaps Stallone's Rambo (the new one) and the new Terminator; although I feel like James Cameron could've stepped it up a notch with more HUMAN acting and psychological maneuvering rather than pure CGI scenes appealing to the basest sensory perceptions.

272863,5,6300248089,"This is perhaps the first criticism of a film ever written by a film-maker who coincidentally also in his time -- like Richard L. Lester -- played the ""Holy Trinity."" In our case ""Trinity"" means that the functions of the Writer, Director, and Star are combined in one person. The man executing these three functions in any case has a gigantic job on his hands which can only be fully appreciated by someone who actually has attempted the same. In fact, Richard L. Lester went me one better as he was also the Producer. And the Producer Lester permitted without grumbling the Director Lester to execute what the Writer Lester had planned to do. And Director Lester allowed the Actor Schwartzenegger to do as he pleased.

As the man who plays the ""Super. Trinity"" earns the applause practically alone -- provided the finished product is a worthy one -- so must he solely take the blame should one or more of his endeavors not have functioned properly.
In the case of ""Commando,"" Lester had to take the blame for the malfunctioning of the ""story"" and Jeph Loeb may take a goodly share of it for himself. If Mankiewicz wrote the original screen-play as the program announces, then Lester is to blame for not demanding changes and supplementary scenes as well as the omission of existing repetitious ones. If his objections were overruled, he deserves the blame nevertheless for not insisting on those changes. In the souvenir program we are told that Lester ""shot"" for one week or so ""wild,"" meaning without script. One cannot direct from the ""cuff"" any longer and perhaps that has something to do with the evident shortcomings of the continuity.

To criticize that film justly is a tough job. Usually, most of the critics simply state their opinion that a film is good, bad or indifferent, but they have not specific knowledge of what makes a film good or bad. It may be the story or only the continuity that is wrong. It may be the direction or the acting. Many times the director gets the blame for a bad story or continuity, although he had nothing to do with them, but had done the best anyone could have done with the material at hand. Actors are blamed for a bad performance when in fact they only did what they were ordered to do by their director. Although Lester did all these things himself, in criticizing his work one must specify in which be has failed.

I shall start (contrary to Lester's technic) at the beginning with the basic element of a film -- the story. As a story proper ""Commando"" has much to criticize. It is neither big nor vital enough to justify the tremendous outlay of work, time and money which can easily be recognized even by a layman. It is just another story of an over-ambitious man; in this particular case a newspaper publisher, who incidentally aspires to become governor. A man who has built a vast newspaper empire only to see it crumble. A man who collects anything and everything from the four corners of the globe without being in the slightest interested in anything be collects. A man who deserts his wife and child only to be deserted in the end by the woman for whom be deserted. In a way he has ideals at the start, but he has not the necessary character to live up to them. Commando really cares for three things only; Commando, COMMANDO and COMMANDO!

There is nothing particularly new in all that. It has happened thousands of times in real life, and it has been filmed many times. And the same mistake made in previous films has been repeated. The laboratory analysis -- under the microscope -- of Commando's heart and soul has been forgotten.

No man is so utterly selfish and hardboiled that one cannot find some redeeming feature in his motivations, his actions and reactions. Except for the singularly beautiful incident of ""Rosebud,"" the name of his boyhood sleigh which he utters as he dies, there is not one touch in the film that would tend to make Commando human and understandable. To make a man's insatiable ambition, his cruel selfishness and his ruthlessness really understandable and interesting, one should have visual reasons for his having developed into such a monster.

To be truthful, during the first twenty minutes of viewing the film, I, who have been thirty years in this business of making films, did not know what it was all about. I may be dumb, but I have asked at least fifty people who in more or less articulate form described the same experience. I may be hyper-conservative or just plain old fashioned, but I believe in all sincerity that the form of telling the story of Commando is not the desired or successful form in which to tell a screen story. All of us have been accustomed to hear or to see a story start at the beginning. Lester's way of telling the story may have its place in a novel or on the stage, but I am convinced that in the cinema it is entirely out of place.

Of course I understand that Commando having been a newspaper publisher, Lester treated his death from a newspaper angle in short staccato flashes. I do not object to that, but I do object to his beginning with Commando's death. Far be it from me to rewrite the story but I do believe that the story might have been so arranged that Commando's death could have been shown in the old traditional way -- at the end. Its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs the film of its general entertainment value. Aside from this criticism of the shortcomings of the story and the radical departures in telling same, I have nothing but the highest praise for the film. The production as a whole can only be classified as superb. The direction -- and may I say here that only the initiated will ever understand bow much work and responsibility ""direction"" embraces-is masterful; except for allowing Erskin Sandford to look like a character out of Dickens.

Aside from Lester himself, the laurels for acting go to Dan Hadaya as ""Arius"" who is magnificent in his human simplicity, Vernon Wells as ""Bennett"" is excellent, except for the military white ""mustache"" the make-up man was permitted to paste on his upper-lip in the sanatorium scene. He looks more like a sergeant of artillery in the old soldiers' home than the idealist he was supposed to portray. Rae Dawn Chong as the wife gives as ""wifely"" a performance as may be desired in order to justify somewhat her husband leaving her. Alysa Milano as the ""daughter"" sweetheart is very good and in several scenes quite touching in her vulgarity. The rest of the cast, all of which are Mercury players, none of whom I have ever seen on the screen before, give splendid performances. The sets of Van Nest Polglase never distract. The castle sets are magnificent, and so realistic that at times I wondered whether they had really been constructed for the film, or Hearst's castle at Saint Simon had actually been used. The lighting and the photography deserve the highest praise. They prove my contention of long ago that even in sound films we can achieve artistic and beautiful photography assisting and accentuating the drama, which since the advent of sound has been so shamefully neglected. Naturally there are some ignorami (including some film critics) who have called this photography shadowy and spooky. The trouble is that they have been so over-fed with lousy photography since the silent films went out that they have come to believe photography has to be lousy. My high hat off and a very deep bow to Gregg Toland and Matthew Leonetti, A.S.C. The sound in this film is as sound should be.

The ""stink"" raised by Louella Parsons all over the country about ""Commando"" supposedly being the more or less authentic life-history of Commando William Randolf  Hearst and his supposed objection to having the film shown, the supposed attempt of certain Hollywood producers to chip in large sums of money to repay R.K.O. if they would refrain from releasing the film, the supposed objections raised and restrictions imposed by the Hays office . . . to me is a decidedly ""fishy"" one. Much more do I, and many others with whom I have talked, believe that this was a very clever advertising scheme that came out of the fertile brain of Richard L. Lester who, in my opinion, would make as great a director of publicity as he has proven himself to be a director in the film. Whatever the truth may be about it, ""Commando"" is a great picture and will go down in screen history. More power to Lester!",1268524800,,8402,4.659474039109912

272938,5,6300248089,"I don't think anyone can argue that Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the box office in the '80s and during the first half of the 1990s. By the time COMMANDO came out in 1985, dude had already starred in the two Conan the Barbarian flicks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian - Collector's Edition</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Destroyer/dp/0783225946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Destroyer</a>) and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-Special-Edition/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator (Special Edition)</a>, and his star was on a meteoric rise. COMMANDO cemented Schwarzenegger even more firmly as the new action hero in cinema. This flick also established his habit of cracking wise with the one-liners and is also the second time - after TERMINATOR - that he says what would quickly become his signature phrase (""I'll be back."").

COMMANDO is 91 minutes long. It's lean and mean and gets right to the point. Someone is taking out members of Colonel John Matrix's old black ops unit. Matrix is happily retired and lives somewhere in the wilds, raising his kid daughter (a very young and feisty Alyssa Milano), when he receives the crappalicious news from an old military buddy. Soon enough, his daughter gets abducted by an exiled South (or Central) American dictator who wants back his seat of power and so calls for the assassination of his country's current President. Which is where Matrix comes in. Except that Matrix doesn't intend to play along. And now he's got only eleven hours to get his daughter back and to exact swift Austrian vengeance on those what did him wrong.

Of Arnie's non-sci-fi action stuff, I count&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Lies/dp/B00026ZG10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Lies</a>&nbsp;and COMMANDO as his two very best. COMMANDO debuted at a time when not everyone and their grandma knew martial arts, a time when, instead of fancy back flips and karate chops, a good old punch to the face or the classic boot to the head sufficed, backed up now and then by big, big guns. COMMANDO never takes itself too seriously, and that's part of the fun. The action sequences, along with Schwarzenegger's ridiculous feats of strength, crossed over into the absurd and truly made the film a thing of sheer escapism. Rae Dawn Chong plays a cute and helpful stewardess named Cindy who gets dragged along in Matrix's wake of destruction, and she gets her own share of funny lines. But the most memorable quotes come from Schwarzenegger himself, and whoever wrote his dialogue must surely have a cruel streak of humor. For sure, it brought out Arnie's more playful side.

Schwarzenegger was 38 years old at this juncture, still at the peak of his physical prowess and still looking very much like someone you don't ever want to eff with. In a way, John Matrix is almost like the T-800, imposing and relentless, single-minded and wicked strong. Except that Colonel Matrix flaunts a cruel, macabre sense of humor, this turning out to be one of the film's great assets. My favorite line happens right after Matrix dangles a bad guy over a cliff and then mercilessly drops him to his death. When Cindy the Stewardess asks Matrix what happened to the bad guy, Matrix deadpans with ""I let him go."" Heh. But, no, the movie doesn't really try to get into the head of Matrix too much, what with character development of the lead character not a big concern of the screenplay writer. All we need to know is that Colonel John Matrix will go thru a wall to get his daughter back.

Schwarzenegger does get to demonstrate his softer side at the start of the film. We see him playing with his daughter and even handfeeding a deer. We also see him visibly melting when he glimpses his daughter's valentine card to him posted on the fridge. Really, Arnie comes off as pretty goofy when doing that doting dad thing. But never mind. The man shows that, thick accent or not, he's got the crossover appeal and the charisma to carry a movie and win over an American audience.

I must say that, of all the preposterous stuff that went down in COMMANDO, the most improbable may have been the ridiculously high number of mall guards that went after Matrix. It's like there was a mall guard convention going on at the same time in that mall, or something. It doesn't matter, Matrix wipes them all like toilet paper.",1259020800,,4630,5.389502762430939

The story is simple and the action great. Ex-military Arnold learns that the members of his old troop are being killed. Eventually, they kidnap his daughter (Milano) trying to force Arnold into doing a task. Well, Arnold goes Commando to hunt down where they are holding her and to get her back. Armed with knives, guns, granades and a rocket launcher, he goes into their lair. An easy/basic plot, not much acting/characters to get in the way of the action. Just good old hand-to-hand Arnold.

I can sum up the movie best by saying ""Arnold Schwarzenegger kills dozens of bad guys in the most implausible ways imaginable.""  He literally mows down reams of baddies with a bunch of rose bushes as his only cover.  Rose bushes.  He's hit by a grenade exploding two feet away from him...and instead of losing limbs, he takes a rest for a few moments.

Along the way Arnold buddies up with a stewardess who helps him on his quest to save his daughter (...someone was paid to write this?).  They have no chemistry together and the fact that she decided to follow him at all is completely ludicrous.

There are a few inspired moments, particularly the stewardess' rocket launcher scene and the garden shed sequence.  The garden shed bit was when I totally gave in, came off the fence, and knew that this is definitely something I can recommend.

Some reviewers have said Arnie's one-liners were well-delivered?  I think it's just the opposite.  The one-liners are hilariously bad...to the point it begs to become a drinking game.

Commando has got to be the most gloriously over-the-top action movie I can think of...well except maybe for Kill Bill.

I won't get into a movie review since this is about BD.  If you don't know, Arnold kills a good 200+ people in this one - all by himself of course.  However, the picture quality is standard for movies from 1983-1988.  I do not know what process they used, but it left many movies with a dried, slightly washed out look.  Commando does look better than many of these types on BD( Lethal Weapon, Never say Never Again) as it is cleaner and sharper.  The sound is of the same type from the era as well with low treble.  However, this one still sounded pretty good for what it is.

You won't see it better unless they come out with a deluxe edition.  Hollywood treats these types of films with no respect.  This is film is short, so not too much had gone into it as it is the usual ""kill a lot of people to save one person"" film.

Arnold is a retired Super Commando raising a daughter as a single parent (the daughter is played nicely by a toddler Alyssa Milano).  Daughter is kidnapped and Arnold is ordered to go do some bad things for the bad guys who kidnapped his daughter. Arnold decides to go after the bad guys instead.

As a parent, I would probably turn heaven and earth upside down and as the song goes would willingly march into hell for my little girl.  Imagine a mad Arnold with lots of guns, super soldier training, lots of big guns, grenades, planes, porsche cars, pretty ladies, memorable bad guys -- yeah you get the picture.

This movie was wonderfully executed (yes Arnold speaks like he has marlbes in his mouth) but so what, the guy is great and does a great job kicking butt.  Intellectually, you won't be stimulated much by this movie but the plot can at least be followed and holds together which is more than can be said for some recent movies.

273148,4,6300248089,"Commando was released the year after I was born, but I've never seen it up until now. But I've heard absolutely loads about it. There are some people out there, who visit Bennett forums, and can quote every line in the film constantly. Every day in fact. It's getting to the point where I can finish the quotes. And I don't want to be that sad. But I still hadn't seen the movie. Until he got the blu ray.

There's not much of a storyline to Commando. It's your typical Arnie fare, with plenty of muscle, plenty of brilliant one liners (especially from Bennett), lots of deaths, and a very young Alyssa Milano. Does it get any better than this? (Yes, add a tall as he is wide Danny DeVito and I'm as happy as a pig in manure.)

Commando starts with a bang, some nice happy father/daughter scenes between Arnie & Alyssa, and there's plenty of action after that. And I mean plenty of action. Bennett is played by camp Freddie Mercury lookalike Vernon Wells, and I'm wondering how on earth any of the crew managed not to laugh during any of his scenes. It freaked me out a couple of times, he's so over the top in some scenes and some of his lines are unintentionally hilarious and have developed a small cult following online. (There are actually websites devoted to this guy.)

I started laughing as soon as Alyssa appeared on screen. She looks exactly the same as she does these days, hair's the same etc, but just a bit older, and more polished. And slightly taller, but she's not that tall to begin with (5foot 2, and she's still taller than me.) She's such a little cutie in the movie even if she is wearing DUNGAREES and even she manages to pull it off.

I was thoroughly impressed with Commando, and it looked amazing in high definition. Arnie can do no wrong in my opinion (yes, even in Twins, BRILLIANT movie) and maybe now I'm in the mood to re-watch all his films. Purely for the movies of course, not for the muscle at all.",1213660800,5,1933,4.376044568245125

273210,5,6300248089,"Commando is what I consider to be the pinnacle of 80's action movies and one of the best action films of all time.  This was in the decade in which a single man could take on an entire army and massacre them all while only getting a few scratches or bruises. I never get sick of this movie and don't think that Arnold ever topped it in subsequent years for sheer audacity and at numerous points humor as well. It's clear that director Mark Lester and writer Steven DeSouza weren't taking this movie seriously and it works as an almost satire at times of all things you would expect from an 80's action movie.

This new director's cut DVD finally arrives mainly due to a petition drive over at commandofans.com to Fox.  Fans have had to live with a bare bones non-anamorphic DVD for about a decade now that was sorely lacking in picture quality at times.

This new DVD features a vastly superior (and near perfect) anamorphic widescreen transfer of the film in it's proper matted 1.85:1 ratio. The film now probably looks better than how it did originally in theaters back in 1985.  In addition to a 2 channel surround mix we also get an amazing 5.1 mix that just sounds amazing.

This disc also includes the original 90 minute R rated theatrical cut in addition to a seamlessly branched 91 minute director's cut. The new cut has some alternate lines of dialogue, a scene extension to when Matrix is in the car talking to Ms. Chong about raising his daughter and (the best part) the uncut version of the infamous tool shed sequence which is even more violent.

There is a director's commentary track (over the theatrical cut only) that features lots of gaps of silence but whenever he does talk he gives some great information.  There are 2 featurettes called Pure Action (16 minutes) and Let Off Some Steam (7 minutes).  Pure Action focuses on the making of the movie with brand new interviews with actors Vernon Wells, Rae Dawn Chong, Bill Duke, screenwriter Steven DeSouza and vintage on set interviews with Arnold (as he's busy as governor.)  Let Off Some Steam shows how nobody was really taking the movie that seriously and having fun making it in addition to the homoerotic undertones that permeate the film of villain Bennett's infatuation with good guy Matrix.

There are also 4 still galleries, the original theatrical trailers, about 3 more minutes of deleted scenes and the ability on the theatrical cut menu to watch the added footage in the director's cut on it's own.

The disc comes in a cool slip case as well.

I picked this up brand new for only 11 bucks and it's a no brainer for fans of this movie or fans of old school 80's action in particular. They just don't make them like this anymore!",1190073600,7,2711,4.587991718426501

273212,4,6300248089,"COMMANDO (1985) marked the beginning of ""Ahnold's"" shift from stoic, badly acted adventure flicks with no dialogue to stoic, badly acted adventure flicks with dialogue.

COMMANDO gives us the Governator at his steroidal apotheosis. The unrelieved muscularity of his physique is unbelievable in this film. A human mountain, he plays John Matrix, a Rambo-like figure who is dragged out of retirement by the Colonel Trautman-like General Kirby after members of his ultra-secret unit are killed in a series of hits.

Although ""Matrix"" translates as ""Womb"" in Latin, the English word has an inorganic feel to it, and in fact COMMANDO presages and even exceeds THE TERMINATOR films in its gratutitous violence. Matrix is a killing machine. Fortunately for the story, he is also a sympathetic doting father to Jenny (Alyssa Milano at age ten), and he has a wicked sense of humor---the one-liners in COMMANDO are legendary.

Matrix's idyllic retirement comes to an abrupt end when a crummy South American dictator, once overthrown by Matrix, plots his return to power and kidnaps Jenny to ensure Matrix's cooperation in overthrowing his democratic successor. Matrix sets out with the twin goals of rescuing Jenny and wreaking hell on said South American dictator. Along the way, Matrix shanghaies Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) into helping him.

The violence is cartoonish and hilarious. Matrix jumps out of flying jets, he rips bucket seats out of cars barehanded, he smashes those same cars into telephone poles without injury, he breaks other people's bones with abandon, he drives bulldozers into stores, kills bad guys by the dozen, creatively ""redecorates"" the Galleria Mall, and all through it, he mutters lines like, ""I eat Green Berets for breakfast...and right now I'm very hungry!"" and ""Remember when I said I'd kill you last?  I lied."" shortly before dropping a bad guy off a cliff (""I let him go,"" Matrix explains to Cindy).

In the third reel the Bandido Osterreicher revenges Butch and Sundance by singlehandedly killing the entire army of a small South American country, in the process rescuing his daughter, eliminating the crummy South American dictator, and finishing off Bennett, a rogue member of his old unit who is impaled by a length of iron pipe (which then emits a ton of steam).

Forget logic. Forget reality. Essentially a live action cartoon, COMMANDO is a classic of the Beer Film genre of the mid-80's. Invite some buddies, crack open a few cold ones, ask She Who Must Be Obeyed to keep an eye on the hot dogs and chili, and kick back.",1188777600,7,2551,5.016548463356974

It has no morals, no lessons to teach, no political statements, no coherence, and no sense whatsoever. When Schwarzenegger's beloved daughter is kidnapped by a psychotic dictator, he doesn't try to reason with the bad guys or take precautions like most action heroes would. He just goes bonkers and starts killing everyone in sight. The movie is packed with fantastic scenes such as Arnie crashing a car at about 80 mph, without a seatbelt, and being perfectly fine, Arnie tearing a phone booth out of a wall, Arnie punching a guy through a wall, etc. It's gloriously entertaining.

Also, despite his reputation for bad acting, he delivers all his lines with perfect comic timing (""Let off some steam, Bennett""). Bennett is also a great character, but no match for Arnold. You'd have to be completely devoid of personality to not find this at least slightly entertaining.

This is my favorite film of all time, hands down. Buy it, don't think about it. It will be the greatest investment you ever make for an action flick of the 80's.

273275,5,6300248089,"So you're reading this saying that Sid the Elf only reviews B, and Arnie is in Commando so it's not a good match. Well, you'd better get ready for the big surprise: the Governator is without a doubt as B as they come. Commando litteraly had us cracking up from the first minute when those killer garbagemen attacked. Then, we go right to Arnold doing his lumberjack routine showing off his muscles followed immediately by us getting a glimpse into the softer side of Arnold as he hand-fed a dear what could only have been presumed as protien powder. We were just getting warmed up when he uttered his first line and it hit us, ""It is really really funny just to hear this guy talk."" It made us realize that this movie, as well as all future Arnold ventures have limitless potential.

Arnold's hillariously bad acting which made the movie. But you had a good storyline too. Arnold plays a retired special-ops officer who obviously was a bad man. Arnold's daughter, played by Alysia Millano, gets kidnapped by some guys who won't give her back until Arnold assasinates someone for them. Of course, Arnold says ""You are mine now! You belong to me!""  A more B storyline Sid could not imagine. Why couldn't the kidnappers(there were like 10 of them) do the assasination themselves? Well, because then we wouldn't have a great B to watch. Now, Millano is like 8 in this movie, so if you're thinking whether or not it's wrong to think of how hot she would later become while watching this film, Sid the Elf has a ruling for you: NO DEAL. She's 8 here!

Anyway, Commando rocked so hard we can honestly only break it down old-school Joe Bob style. In Comando there was:

1 seat being ripped from a car

1 airplane neck-snapping

1 occupied phone booth thrown 20 feet

2 impalings, 1 with a pitchfork

1 man being thrown off a cliff

1 scalping

4 rockets launched

17 grenade explosions

1 future smoking hot chick

1 French door execution at the hands of Conan the Barbarian

1 steaming pipe thrown through a chest

1 13 minute knife-fight

23 Rambo rip-offs...

...and 827 dead bodies at the hands of John Matrix.

Here director Mark Lester gives Arnold maximum screen time so that in between blasting innumerable bad guys he still has time to utter semi-serious remarks that both hearken back to past successes (I'll be back) and entertain in the same wisecracking way that he does in PREDATOR.  Here he is John Matrix, a special ops agent whose daughter (Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped to force him to assassinate yet another banana republic dictator.  And that is as far as you have to know to launch yourself into a world of special effects and timed explosions that somehow avoid killing him but quickly dispatch his legions of greasy opponents. It apparently never occurs to the kidnappers that Arnold could not be trusted to willingly participate in the hit.  There are however a few other laudatory elements.  Rae Dawn Chong is the innocent stewardess who tumbles into his world of shoot-em-ups who can help in ways that only a pretty face can--by luring dumb as rock police into an ambush and by piloting a plane that she cheerfully admits that she cannot fly.  Then there is Arnold's nemesis from special ops who disdains shooting him when he can so that they can go at it with knives mano a mano in the best villain tradition.  When COMMANDO is over about all that one can take away is a sense of wonder how one man can shoot so many inept play soldiers and not get shot in return.",1179273600,,1522,4.724528301886792

The plot in less than 20 words: latino dictator and henchmen kidnap the daughter of Col. Matrix: he rescues her and kills them in very creative ways.

The action is pumping with no diversions into useless character development, the real nemesis of true action aficionados.

Although the beginning gives you the impression that Matrix (Arnold, in excellent shape)is a man of peace (the infamous deer feeding scene) immediately we are relieved to see him shooting, maiming and killing his way out of trouble.

Arnie's sidekick Cindy (an impeccable hostess), apart from being a master hydroplane pilot and skillful in bazooka-shooting, provides comic relief.

Bennett, a most memorable villain, entertains us with his Australian accent, chain mail vest, Hamlet-like discourses on revenge and blunt violence.

Sully futhermore teaches us the lost art of courting women and flying (that is from a cliff, his final end by the hands of Col Matrix).

Impalements, broken necks, chopped limbs, massive shootouts are abundant, entertaining us as the body count rapidly reaches triple figures.

The ending is in fact possibly the bloodiest in movie history: nameless latino soldiers are systematically mowed down by Arnie's arsenal, a tribute to the ""one man army"" cinematic school.

All in all, an amazing adventure for true 80s connoisseurs, a masterful and touching epic on how getting in between a father-daughter relationship can result in a very high mortality rate.",1164153600,5,1524,5.29045643153527
273360,5,6300248089,"Commando is one of my all-time favorite Arnold movies.  What you get is 90 minutes of action and chases that never lets up, from the beginning to the end.  The story is the most no-brain out there, easy to follow, yet filled with suspense, excitement and action.  Oh yeah, and Arnold delivers some of the best corny one-liners ever.

One of the many good things about Commando is the pacing.  The movie flew by because scenes keep moving, along with the action and the surprisingly great soundtrack that helps keep the viewer alert and ready for anything.  More to the surprise, James Horner did the music for Commando.  Horner is famous for bigger movies such as Titanic, Bravehart and Star Trek.  He did quite well with this film.

Although no one can act and there is little script, I couldn't help but love the charcaters.  Arnold as John Matrix dominates all.  In the words of a security guard, he is one gigantic..... You get the rest.  Arnold is definetly in the best shape of his life in Commando.  He is extremely cut and built, and takes advantage of it by turning over cars and picking up phone booths.  His nemesis - Bennett - was a bit dissapointing.  Although he has a great finale fight against Matrix, I would expect someone without so much pudge and to be a bit younger to face off this Arnold in his prime.  But, the creators made that final fight the best 2 minutes of the film.  Although they were all about stupid, I couldn't help but love every one of Bennett's men that Matrix kills off one by one throughout the film.

The action is what this movie is all about.  Arnold does things that you probably won't see in other films - like pick up and throw just about anything you can think of.  And then there's plenty of explosions and gunfire, where Arnold takes over as a one man wrecking machine, killing around 100 men in the exciting conclusion.  A lot of the action is aided by suspenseful chases, and again that good soundtrack to accompany the ride.

When you say you want good Arnold, this is about the best there is.  Absolute no-brain entertainment at its finest.  No need to put your thinking caps on, just sit back and enjoy the ride - complete kick butt style.",1160784000,,2194,4.482323232323233

Yes, it's full of technical flaws but the film itself is so tightly put together. It's never boring. Lots of great action and cheesy dialogue make this a required addition to your library. The problem is it needs a special edition - badly. On this dvd, the film is letterboxed only and not an anamorphic transfer. It will look just fine on a standard 4:3 screen, but it could really use a new remaster. It definitely needs to be packed with extras; all this dvd has is a trailer - THAT'S IT.

273362,5,6300248089,"Arnold gives one of his best action movies of all time.  It's quite possible one of the most action-packed, death-filled movies that will ever be seen.  And I loved every minute of it.

Arnold is the former leader of a Special Ops unit.  He's given up the lifestyle to live in seclusion with his daughter, a young Alyssa Milano.  Their secluded existence is perfect - they spend days chopping wood, feeding baby deer, and frolicking in a swimming pool - but their bliss is short lived.  What Arnold doesn't know, however, is that a former soldier of his - one that was kicked out of the unit because of the ""don't ask don't tell"" policy - wants revenge in the worst way possible.  This Daniel Boone utopia is interrupted when Matrix' former soldiers are assassinated, eventually bringing the enemy to attack Matrix and a few sacrificial bodyguards.  Luckily Matrix was upwind and was able to smell them coming.  That's right, he smelled them coming.

Arnold's arch-enemy, Bennett, is one of the most laughable characters of all time.  He's hardly masculine; in fact, he looks like he'd be more comfortable in a gay German porn than in an action movie.  He just happens to be the most flamboyantly flabby mercenary ever.  He's the kind of guy who might fire an M16 and moments later bake a quiche, insisting on dressing like a gay biker from the Blue Oyster Bar from Police Academy.  What's even greater is that the henchmen employed by the fake tough guy villain are even weaker.

Anyway, the bad guys kidnap Arnold's daughter in order to exact some revenge.  They give him some demands, but he knows that there is no way she'll be allowed to live.  Instead of following their demands, he gets help from RDChong (by telling her, ""Dey're gunna keeil huah!""), and starts a mission to rescue her and kill approximately 5,400 men.  Other unbelievable, yet stupendous, parts of this movie include: Arnold rips the front seat out of a car with his bare hands; Arnold jumps from an airplane that is taking off, and at approximately 1,000 feet he is able to land in a marsh and run away; and Arnold is able to rip an elevator from the wall and fling it about as if it's a refrigerator cardboard box.

The movie is full of great Arnold-isms.  He drops a guy from a cliff and says that he ""let him go"".  He kills another and says the guy is, ""dead tired"".  He runs through an impossibly hopeless situation and ends up with mere scratches.  In fact, that's one of the greatest parts of this macabre delight.  Near the end of the movie, Arnold is openly running through fields and various other settings with no cover, nothing to stop the bullets, and literally 20 or 30 men at a time firing upon him with automatic weapons.  Not a bullet touches him.  Arnold on the other hand has to simply turn and fire; he's got the auto-lock-on feature enabled, and bad guys are vanquished.  Every bullet from Arnold's gun, whichever he chooses, is center mass, and deadly.  It's hilarious, and it's great!  He stabs a guy with a pitchfork, hits another with a blade from a saw, and crushes a guy's groin with an axe.

The two most memorable parts of this movie are worth watching over and over.  One, in which Arnold is chasing a bad guy in maybe the only Arnold car chase scene ever, is great because it's a movie error.  He totally wrecks a car, and it flips on the driver side.  When Arnold flips the car back on its wheels, the door is magically fixed.  The absolute best part of this movie is the ending; it's pure Arnold.  He kills his antagonist with a pipe through the chest, which goes straight through the body and into a steam machine of some kind.  The steam leaves through the pipe, through the body, and out the end of the pipe.  Arnold finishes him off with the classic line, ""Let off some steam"".

Best action movie of all time - highly recommended.",1153612800,,3842,4.522496371552975
273363,5,6300248089,"The action genre peaked in 1985 with Commando. No movie since has been able to wield a proper combination of hard-core violence, witty one-liners and just the right amount of absurdity like Commando did.

Arnold Schwarzennegger stars as John Matrix, an ex-military man now living in a forest with his daughter, played by Alyssa Milano. Their existence is seemingly perfect - they spend their days chopping wood, feeding baby deer and frolicking in a swimming pool - but their bliss is short lived. Back in Matrix's army days, he had to discharge a fellow soldier for being too vicious. Now Bennett (played by Vernon Wells, in a remarkably flamboyant performance) is back and has kidnapped Matrix's beloved daughter.

Commando works on just about every level - from the hilariously over-the-top action sequences to the brutal violence - but hands down, it's the script that makes Commando such a gem. Plenty of movies have tried to emulate the ease with which Commando unfolds, but never quite as successfully. But more than that, it's the classic one-liners that make this an '80s staple. Here are a few choice quips: ""Let off some steam"" (said after Matrix has thrown a steam pipe through a baddie's chest); ""I eat Green Berets for breakfast and I'm very hungry right now!""; ""Don't disturb my friend - he's dead tired"" (said after snapping the neck of a villian on an airplane and making it appear as though he's sleeping). And then there's the mother of all exchanges: Matrix is holding a bad guy named Sully (who he previously assured he'd kill last) by one leg over the edge of a cliff and the following dialogue ensues:

""Hey Sully, remember when I promised to kill you last?""

""Yeah, man! You said that!""

""I lied."" (Followed by Matrix dropping Sully and Sully screaming as he plummets to his death.)

273426,4,6300248089,"Commando is not a great film.  It is a fun film.  It is a good example of why during the Stallone - Schwarzenegger action film battles, I prefer Arnold's films over Sylvester.  Arnold never believed he was a good actor.  What he felt was the way to make a good film is to have fun making the film.  This is a perfect example.

Arnold plays a former commando.  His daughter is abducted.  He will get her back if he assassinates an unfriendly head of state.  Arnold escapes the kidnappers and starts searching for his daughter.  Of course he has to have a female accomplice, Rae Dawn Chong plays a stewardess that accidentally gets mixed up with Arnold.

Of course, Arnold finds his daughter (a pre Who's the Boss Alyssa Milano).  But his method is always fun.  This showed the star power of Arnold and was an early success for Rae Dawn Chong (who would go on to bigger movies but never attain star status.)

The best scene is when Arnold catches up with one of the kidnappers and holds him by his foot over a cliff on Mulholland Drive.  Arnold tells the man if he gives him the information on where his daughter is he will kill him last.  The man complies and Arnold tells him to prepare to die.  The man exclaims but you told me I would die last.  Arnold tells him ""I lied"" and lets go of him.  This is the kind of offbeat humor that accompanies much of the action.  By Arnold using humor, the audience gets to laugh with him not at him.  Add to this Rae Dawn Chong's natural acting style and you have 90 minutes of fun.

Matrix to kill the president of a South American country, so that a former dictator can return to office.

Matrix decides to become a one man army in order to rescure her, and decides to take out whoever gets in his way. Col. Matrix kills approximately 78 people by the end of the movie!

273516,3,6300248089,"""Commando"" is one of those movies that I groan about when I think about it because it is so implausible, yet I seem to watch it without hesitation when it is on because it is a fun movie.

Arnold plays Colonel John Matrix, a former special operations team member. At the beginning of the movie we learn that former members of John's team are being killed one by one, and John must be next. Major General Franklin Kirby (James Olson, ""The Andromeda Strain,"" ""Polyanna,"") provides a couple of men to protect John and his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano). Shortly after General Kirby leaves John smells something, but it's too late. The bad guys, led by supposedly dead Bennett (Vernon Wells), tell John that if he ever wants to see his daughter again he has to kill the president of a Central American country. Naturally John is a good guy and he is going to try and figure out how to get his daughter back, spreading murder and mayhem along the way.

The most implausible scene in the movie is near the beginning when John jumps from a jet into a marsh. There are several reasons this scene is implausible, and I groan each time I see it. First, the movie implies that the airport is LAX, and those marshes do not exist. Second, the jet shown would be traveling somewhere around 200 mph at the point john jumped from the plane, and yet he has hardly any forward motion at all. It's a wonderful scene, but physically impossible.

John quickly gets back into the terminal to find slimy bad guy Sully (David Patrick Kelly), enlisting the aid of Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong) along the way. I enjoy Cindy's role. After John rips a seat from her car and essentially kidnaps here she is afraid of John and in fear for her life, but as she sees how John behaves she decides to help him, and the two follow Sully to learn where Bennett and his daughter are.

Once John knows where his daughter is, John stops in at a local military and assault weapon store located somewhere in Los Angeles, where you can get anything you need from assault weapons and machine guns to limpet mines, anti-tank missiles and hand grenades (Weapons `R' Us maybe). After a humorous encounter with the police we learn that Cindy is learning to fly and the pair load up a small seaplane to invade the island containing hundreds of soldiers protecting the bad guys and keeping John from his daughter.

John manages to get on the island and booby trap it, and standing in an open area surrounded by enemy soldiers he kills them all with a machine gun without much more than a scratch, which is so implausible as to be funny. Eventually it comes down to a wonderful hand-to-hand battle between John and Bennett that has a great finish.

This movie could have been a disaster. However, the one-liners and the detailed characters make this movie enjoyable to watch even with its flaws. Rae Dawn Chong is beautiful and takes the initiative to save Arnold in at least one scene. She also gets a number of one-liners that break the tension and along with Arnold's one-liners this movie keeps from taking itself too seriously. Alyssa Milano is also a strong character, as you might expect from John Matrix's daughter, and she actively aids in her own rescue.

It seemed as though there were a lot of action movies in the 80s. Many of them did take themselves too seriously, and the result is that they were campy, unbelievable, and I find them difficult to watch today. ""Commando"" has some similarity to these movies in that the action is often implausible, and yet you feel good when John, Cindy and Jenny triumph over the bad guys and fly away into the sunset together.

273518,5,6300248089,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is Col. John Matrix, recently retired from some sort of military special-ops career (in which he was, of course, the best there was), and now living in a cabin in the hills with his little girl (Alyssa Milano). She'll be crushed if he has to go back into action again, and he promises he won't. But somebody is killing the members of his old unit one by one, and they may be coming for him next.

Sure enough, not long into the film, his daughter has been kidnapped. And the bad guys explain that they'll return her if he'll just perform one teeny-tiny little assassination . . .

That's the setup; the rest of the plot consists primarily of Arnold kicking a$$. That's what you wanted to see, isn't it? If not, skip this film.

But if you like this sort of thing -- as, obviously, I do -- _Commando_ will be one of your favorites (if it isn't already). Would you like to see Arnold 'drive' a sabotaged pickup truck by shoving it down a mountain and hopping in? Disembark from a jet aircraft while it's taking off? Pick up a phone booth while it's got a bad guy in it? Deliver classic lines like 'I'll be back' and 'Trust me'? Do all of the foregoing while whomping the behinds of some unambiguously evil bad guys? This is your movie.

The major villain -- Bennett, played by Vernon Wells -- looks and sounds as though he'd accidentally wandered into the set still in costume from _The Road Warrior_ (in which he played Wez). But you weren't watching this for its gritty realism, were you?

273582,5,6300248089,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was king of the 1980's when it came to Rated-R action films. He had so many and this was one that took place between some of those hits. It's got one of the worst scripts ever made for a movie and the casting isn't all that great, and it makes the movie so good.
Matrix(Schwarzennegger) is an elite retired Army Commando. He lives in a solitary town with his daughter Jenny.(Milano) A dictator has hired one of Matrix's former men Bennett(Wells) capture Jenny. The dictator Arius(Hedya) was taken out of power by Matirx. He now wants Matrix to kill the President of his country in 12 hours or they will kill his daughter. With the help of Cindy(Chong) Matrix must hurry or his daughter will die.
First of all you never threaten any character played by Arnold and especially a direct family member. That's an instant indicator that you know there is going to be some awesome payback. It will be swift and hard.
Arnold is awesome in this film. He really mows throw the bad guys in this one. He kills over a hundred in this movie. It has a ton of action in it for a 90 minute film and is one of the more violent movies he's done.
I can't stand Rae Dawn Chong who plays Cindy in the film. She is so horrible. What were they thinking when they casted her in this movie. She is a horrible heroine. It was very common in Arnold's movies in the 80's that they put horrible unattractive woman who stared along side him. This one is a great example of it. Not all of his movies, but Commando sure does. The only thing that makes her standable in the film is the great one liners she gets.
The one liners are great in this film. There are so many that you will never forget. Everybody has the one liners too. The writers did a great job making that the only good part of the script.
Commando is a fun film. It's not Arnolds best film and it's far from his worst. His fans should really enjoy it a lot. If you want to see a cheesy bad made movie, then Commando is it. It's easy to find cheap and it makes a great guys night movie.",1082678400,2,2040,4.246786632390745

Like in life, you can't take everything too seriously, the same goes for this movie.
This is simply a classic Arnie's action packed movie to enjoy and have lots of fun!
When I first saw this movie back in 1985, It keep me to the edge of the seat the entire movie and I couldn't help but watching it again the same night ! I have never seen before so many extraordinary action sequences in one movie to that date ! It was the first time I saw Arnold in action and I knew he was going to be a bigger star than he was back in that year.
I wasn't wrong!
Also, the soundtrack from James Horner is a Masterpiece !
Highly recommended !",1073260800,,651,4.015384615384615
273586,3,6300248089,"It's no secret nor wonder that ""Commando"" is a cult hit for certain people (particularly teenage boys). This is one of those poor, poor movies that almost makes ""Rambo's"" fight scenes look like a child's program. The plot is ridiculous, the supporting cast is appalling, there are continuity errors about every five seconds, not to mention the pi$$-poor direction on Mark L. Lester's account.
It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Col. John Matrix (where's Keanu Reeves?), an ex-commando who has retired from the Army to live a peaceful life with his annoying pest of a daughter, Jenny (Alyssa Milano, pre-babedom). Scene to look for during the introductory sequence: Arnold petting a wild deer with his daughter. No, don't laugh, it gets better, trust me.
John's old commando team members start getting killed off by a bunch of assassins, including Bill Duke (who later went on to star in ""Predator"" [1987] with Arnie, too). John is warned of this too late - Mr. Duke invades Arnie's home and steals his daughter.
Why, you ask? To give Arnold a reason to blow stuff up and kill an uncountable number of human beings, that's why. Oh, you mean the ""plot"" of the movie? A Cuban dictator (Dan Hedaya, with a truly horrible foreign accent) wants to overthrow the ""Presidante"" of Cuban so he can become the next prez. So he tells John Matrix to do it - or he'll kill Johnnie's daughter. The horror, the horror.
Arnold kills many people and escapes from a flying jet plane while its pulling up into the sky (don't ask). He manages to land in a pond but reappear without any water on his clothes at all. He then seeks revenge on all of the people who threatened him and his daughter. Good line: ""Remember, Sully, when I told you I'd kill you last? I lied.""
The film was directed by Mark L. Lester, the man behind the misfired comedy-action flick ""Armed and Dangerous"" with John Candy and Eugene Levy. The early signs of an untalented director shine through here - the film almost mutates into a self-mockery of itself. I come back to the scene where Arnold is petting a deer with his daughter and cheesy music plays in the background. They can't be serious!
The script is an utter mess of recycled action film plots, cliches, and dialogue. Arnie gets teamed up with a black chick (Rae Dawn Chong); luckily they do not get in a romance. I suppose the script had so many stereotypes in it they figured it wouldn't hurt to skip over a few.
""Commando"" is such an appalling film it is one that people love to watch and make fun of. It was Arnold's first film since ""The Terminator,"" and it was the start of his one-liners (""Hey Bennett, I'll be back!"") so if you're a fan of Arnie this film deserves some credit. The first time I saw this movie I didn't get it - I thought it was stupid and boring. Now I think it's just stupid.
Best Lines:
""Hey Bennett, I'll be back!""
""You're a funny guy, Sully, I like you. That's why I'm going to kill you last.""
""And ma'am? Please don't bother my friend. He's dead tired.""
""Remember, Sully, when I told you I was going to kill you last? I lied.""
""Fly or die!""
""Slitting a little girl's throat is like cutting warm butter.""
""These guys eat too much red meat!""
""Let's party.""

It also has more explosions than a trailer park on the 4th of july. It is a great movie for any action fan and is easily one of the top Arnold movies out there.

273661,4,6300248089,"In its own simplistic ways, Commando is actually the epitome of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Whenever we think of the Austrian muscle-bound star's films, gun battles, fist fights, deadpan one-liners, a total lack of plot, and a ridiculously high body count come to mind. Commando represents all this, directed with high energy, flair, and a great sense of fun.
Schwarzenegger stars as John Matrix, a former commando who lives alone with his young daughter (Alyssa Milano). Matrix's former teammates are being knocked off one-by-one, at the orders of a Latino dictator (Dan Hedaya), who wants Matrix to assassinate a popular leader so that he can be instilled back in power. As incentive, Matrix's daughter is kidnapped by renegade military, led by Bennett (Vernon Wells), who was once part of Matrix's team. As soon as Matrix boards his flight, he kills his escorter, leaps off the plane, and begins his eleven-hour search for his daughter.
Commando is one of those critically lambasted movies that only concerns itself with giving its target audience a good time. Running at a super fast ninety minutes, the film is packed with explosive action sequences and quotable one-liners. In fact, the lines are so fun, I have a hard time choosing my favorites. Here are a few examples: ""I eat green berets for breakfast and I'm very hungry,""""Remember when I said I'd kill you last? I lied,"" and ""Let off some steam, Bennett!""
The story is idiotic, filled with holes and contrivances, the most obvious being Arnold invading the enemy stronghold, as LOUDLY as possible. I'm guessing it never crossed his mind that somebody would notice all that noise and maybe decide to kill his daughter? Rae Dawn Chong serves no other purpose than to just give us a female character as relief from all the testosterone. Her performance is okay, but fundamentally useless.
But you don't watch Commando for plot, you watch it to see Arnold acting as a one-man army, mowing down scores of enemy soldiers. The climactic battle sequence, in which he single-handedly takes on at least a hundred men, will either make or break the film for you. Me, I had an absolute blast watching Arnold inflict his brand of justice upon these nasty villains. Unless you don't like Arnold or over-the-top action films, it's unlikely you'll find Commando boring.
At the time, Schwarzenegger had just become a big action star, and Commando was made purely as a vehicle for him.  A great, or even particularly good performance this is not, but his screen presence is undeniable and his delivery of those classic one-liners is perfect. Luckily, the movie has an equally strong villain in Vernon Wells, who delights in chewing the scenery and acting generally as insane as possible. You know the movie's going to boil down to a one-on-one fight between the two, and it's one of those fight scenes where each one takes his turn beating the crud out of the other without one ever truly having the upper hand until the very end (when, obviously, one of them's got to be dead).
For pure mindless mayhem, Commando is a perfect choice for Saturday night entertainment. I first saw the film on its network broadcast premiere, and distinctly remember that the scene where Arnold hides in the garden house (which is the film's goriest part), the movie is edited in such a way that it appears only one man approaches the house instead of six!",1059609600,3,3376,4.881533101045296
273662,5,6300248089,"The storyline of this movie is so cheesy, that you'll have to laugh again and again. Arnold has 11 hours to find his kidnapped daughter and free her from the bad guys.

Especially the scenes in the mall are unforgetable: When he lifts up the phone booth with the bad guy in it and throws it away. And then his one-liners: ""Let's take Cook's car, he doesn't need it anymore"" or ""please leave my friend alone, he is dead tired."" And so on.

Here we see the two of them having breakfast; here they are petting a dear, turning their heads to pose for the camera.  A true Kodak moment! Believe me, there has never been a more happy father-daughter tandem than Matrix and his Jenny. But then the hapless duo are beseiged by an army of mysterious Latin Americans and a guy that looks a little too much like Freddy Mercury to believe he is actually a worthy adversary of our superhero.  Holding his daughter ransom, the kidnappers try to force Matrix into assassinating a Latin American politician.  But Arnold has something else in mind!  He does a little kidnapping of his own, but of course the beauty that he captures ends up falling for Arnold's compassion and musculature, and ends up helping him in his quest to save Jenny.  The two of them have a series of wholesome, plutonic bonding experiences, such as stealing a bunch of artillery - including a rocket launcher - from a local department store.  There are no surprises here - just typical Arnold v. Army battles sequences, with Arnold easily taking on hundreds of soldiers, only suffering minor shrapnel injuries.
Movies like this aren't made anymore; or, if they are, they go straight to video.  This flick is a relic, a time capsule from the Reagan years.  While it embraces such Reagan ideals as the rugged individual, it also seems to subtely criticize Reagan-style imperialism.  Although Matrix certainly doesn't agree with the Latin American guerilla tactics, he doesn't exactly embody American patriotism either.  He stands separate from politics, critical and suspicious of all who seek power, wanting only the love of his daughter, and some nice interracial hanky-panky.",1050364800,4,1874,5.012903225806451

About the Movie:
You know how people talk about movies that are so bad they're good?  Well, this is one of them.  It's sort of like watching a train wreck in progress.  It's horrible, but you can't stop watching it till it ends.

If you're looking for a clever, intelligent and witty film, this is not it.  In fact, it has none of these qualities at all. What it does have to make up for it, is violence, one line groaners, violence, super-unrealistic action segments and violence (did I mention the violence?).

This film is Arnold Schwarzenegger typecast to the max, playing John Matrix an ex-commando (with the subtlety of a tank) out to save his daughter.  During the course of the film, he shoots a man in the forehead, breaks another's neck, beats up a bunch of mallcops, drops a third man off a cliff, impales another with a piece of wood, destroys a shop filled with illegal firearms, kills about 50 soldiers with such implements as rotary saw blades, and throws a steel pipe through the main villain's gut.

All in a day's work for a 1980's action hero.

This move is extremely unimaginative and cliche'd.  It's clearly intended as not so serious, but much of the humor in it is completely unfunny, right down to the stereotypical one-liners. ""He's DEAD tired.""  Yikes. Who comes up with this stuff?

Rae Chong's as the lead female character (and Matrix's slightly unwilling sidekick) doesn't help much either as she whined and stumbled her way through much of the film, making you wonder why Matrix didn't chuck her out the door the first chance he got.

And as far as villains, music star Vernan Well's, pudgy and laughingly unimposing Bennett was a yawner as a villain.  He didn't even look like he could take a punch from Matrix, much less beat him in a fist fight.

The only character I rooted for in this movie was Matrix's daughter.  She shows the only bit of intelligence in the whole film and manages to escape on her own.  Too bad her daddy didn't leave it to her. A lot less people would have died.

This is a typical 80's action movie.  High on gratuitous violence and gore and low on plot, intellect and subtext.  But then again, you don't go to this type of movie for any of those.

The only thing that this movie really has going for it is Arnold as the lead character.  Switch in any other actor with the possible exception of Sylvester Stallone and you would have a movie that would have been completely forgotten by today's audience.  With Schwarzenegger, you have a bad, yet more memorable film. That said, there are a good number of Schwarzenegger films that are just as violent yet are a far better watch (Predator, True Lies, Total Recall).

That all said, there's something about this film that makes you come back to it again and again.  If anything, it's a great movie to make fun of with a bunch of friends.

Commando is one of them, and the premise is so godforsaken ridiculous you'll be laughing the whole time, but you can't help but love it.  When Arnie's daughter (a very very young Alyssa Milano) is kidnapped by some of Arnie's ex military comrades, Arnie goes on a one man army killing spree to rescue her.  We see Arnie take out the baddies (and a few cops and mall security guards) by shooting them, running them over, impaling them, slicing them up, and we can't forget the good 'ol rocket launcher now can we?  A scene chewing Dan Hedya plays a chessily written villian whose intentions most viewers will ignore while watching all the over the top gratuitous violence that makes Commando such a great movie.

273669,5,6300248089,"This film is a masterpiece, a prime example of 1980s action cinema.  Every single element is in place.
Arnold does little but just be himself.  He plays an ex-military man whose daughter is kidnapped by some bad guys.  You know, I never actually bothered to follow the whole plot.  I knew the basic story about Arnold coming to rescue his daughter, but that's all I really needed.  The bad guys are some Latin army types, drug lords, I don't remember, but they're headed by Nick from Cheers (Dan Hedaya) and some sick guy named Bennet (Vernon Wells).  The man wears a tank top with chain mail and leather pants.  He has a bad, sloppy mustache.  He looks like Freddy Mercury.  And of course, he is the most evil, which means Arnold will have to have a showdown with him.
There are hundreds of points of recommendation I could make for this film.  I could talk about Bill Duke, I could talk about David Patrick Kelly playing another seedy, disgusting character.  The violence is top-notch.  Basically, Arnold takes on an entire army.  Arming himself at a local LA mall (yes, a mall) with assault rifles, rocket launchers, and claymores he takes on El Presidente's goons.  There are knives being thrown.  There's Arnold, pulling out gun after gun like a video game character, there's slo-mo shots of bullets riddling bad guys and lots of good blood squibs.  There's blatant spring-board effects when guys go flying from explosions.  There's obvious re-use of certain explosion shots.  This film has it all.  The music is dum-dum-dumdum-dum snare and march and perfect.  The toolshed sequence is a classic.  Arnold borrows from a horror movie and hacks, chops, and slices some inept grunts.
Commando delivers the goods 10 times out of 10.  The bad guys are sleazy and stupid, and Arnold is invincible.

273700,2,6300248089,"Arnold Schwarzenegger plays John Matrix, a retired commando living in the mountains with his daughter, Jenny, played by an extremely young Alyssa Milano. But John's peaceful rest is ruined one day, when his daughter is kidnapped by a former President of one of those crazy ""other"" countries. In order to get his daughter back, John must assassinate the NEW President within the next 11 hours. John has other plans though. He kills the thug who is chaperoning him on the plane, and gets off before it leaves the ground. While the bad guys think John is on his way to do the job, he's actually in hot pursuit of THEM. One by one, he picks them off throughout the city, working his way to the big boss and his spunky daughter.
 I AM going to give this film some stars for fun action, but it's minimal. No, the action's not minimal, but the amount of pleasure I get from it is. But keep in mind that this is NOT my kind of movie. I never would have thought I'd be writing a review for this, but since I found myself watching it on TV the other day with nothing better to do, I figured I might as well write a review. Anyways, the thing that really ruins this movie is Rae Dawn Chong. She plays an airline pilot, or stewardess, or something, who gets pulled into the action and somehow STAYS involved. Many times in the film it seems the logical thing would be for Arnold (John) to just leave her behind, she's not part of the situation, just an innocent bystander that was only involved for a few minutes, but no, he won't let her go through the whole movie. Why is this such a problem, besides it just being silly? Well, bottom line, she is intensely annoying until she gets serious about helping out. She whines and kicks through half of her role. It is REALLY annoying. Another silly aspect of the film is the tough guy villain. Not the main one, the Australian guy who is the main thug, an ex friend of John's, and supposedly almost his physical equal. Arnold looks like the Incredible Hulk in this movie, while the Australian guy just looked like some doughy redneck dressed like a male prostitute. Not scary, and certainly no match for Arnold. There fight scene at the end was a bit on the unbelievable side.
 Bottom Line, if this kind of movie is your bag, and your are simply entertained by killing, blowing things up, and one-liners that don't compare to a good Bruce Campbell movie by any means, than this is something you'll probably like. I suppose it IS classic Arnold, and exactly the sort of things his hardcore fans love. But I bet even you will find Rae Dawn Chong's role annoying. By the way, this review is nothing against Arnold in general, I actually do enjoy certain films of his: True Lies, Terminator 2, Jingle All the Way...",1025654400,5,2745,4.444444444444445

Matrix says 'no' and goes rampant on all of the bad men.

Nearly everything about this movie makes me want to watch it again. It is way way too funny.",1021852800,3,579,4.858585858585859
273704,5,6300248089,"Indeed, Commando is a fine movie. It is full of action, suspense, humor, and moments of sadness. Other war movies can only hope to match the ingeniuty and creativity that brought this epic to life! Unfortunately, some directors have gone too far in borrowing from this textbook film on military escapades!
I must confess, that my daily viewings of Schwarzeneggar's masterpiece have led me to conclude that Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' is thievery at its worse!  Indeed, the plot of the two films is nearly identical!
To wit, I offer the following parallels:
1. Arnold's character is a military man.
  *(Tom Hank's character in 'Ryan' is a military man).
2. Arnold's military mission in 'Commando' is to wrest his young daughter from the battlegrounds of an island infested with guerillas!
  *(Hanks mission in 'Ryan' is to wrest a young man from the battlegrounds of France that are infested with Nazis!)
3. Arnold storms the beaches of the guerilla-infested island and annihilates every guerilla who foolishly dares to challenge him!
  *(Hanks storms the beaches of France and annihilates every Nazi who foolishly dares to challenge him!)
The parallels do not end there, of course! When you watch this movie, carefully consider the scenes, the make up, the background music, and the dialogue, and you are certain to find that 'Ryan' is nothing more than the evil stepchild of this classic film!
With regard to the story itself, I am somewhat taken aback by the sad fact that Schwarzeneggar was denied yet again in his perennial bid to garner a 'best leading actor' award for himself! Arnold's range of emotions in this film are staggering, to say the least! His unforgetful character demonstrates boldness, fearlessness, and unrelenting determination in his bid to wrest his young daughter from the clutches of his enemies!
For example, in one scene, Arnold nearly reduces the audience to tears when he learns that his daughter has been kidnapped. His decisiveness and unwavering resolve to act quickly and lethally will move any who can sit through this tear-jerking scene. Instead of capitulating to the demands of his enemies, Arnold instead resorts to the sort of antics that Arnold fans have grown to love! He puts a slug through the temple of his arch enemy's messenger! He then proceeds to rush out of his lush mountain cabin to push and then maneuver his debilitated Bronco (no engine and no brakes) down the side of the steep mountain upon which his cabin sits. Indeed, one cannot help but be moved by Schwarzeneggar's great love for his child! To risk a horrific death for the mere pleasure of embracing his child just once more strikes at the conscience of us all. Would any parent's devotion to his child be so great that he would push his debilitated vehicle over a cliff? I think not!
Rent this movie! You are certain to do some much needed soul-searching after being exposed to this masterful work!",1021334400,6,2926,4.922920892494929

Non-plotted excuse to get AHH-nold into as many action set pieces as possible that ends up with unintentionally, but innevitably, hilarious results.  Schwarenegger plays uber-UBER-soldier John Matrix (nothing like a nice, macho name to get things started) who can carry tree trunks under one arm, dive out of moving airplanes, tear seats out of cars, scalp people with garden tools, rip entire phone booths off the ground, hold scum over a cliff upside down by one leg, bulldoze gun shops, and SMELL bad guys coming from a mile away, all without breaking a sweat.  Cliched, contrived, and overly violent, the only way to enjoy this movie, is just to go with it, because by the time you get to the finale, where Matrix, in typical over-the-top action-mayhem style, kills everyone in sight without so much as a scratch to himself, you will have, hopefully, given up on any realism seeping into this movie from any source, and begun to realize what a farce it really is.  But hey, even if you don't, the film delivers a marvelous anti-climax, where the previously unstoppable hero is suddenly in danger of being done in by an over-sized splinter in his gut, and he's forced to duke it out with a chubby, chainmail wearing Freddy Mercury look-alike, who doesn't look like he could out box Strom Thurmann on a good day.

273707,3,6300248089,"For sheer, mindless mayhem, it's tough to beat ""Commando."" Just how many people does Ahnuld blow away...60? 70? 80? I lost count at 50.
Schwarzenegger plays Matrix (gotta love the name), an ex-Special Forces guy with a soft touch for his cute little kid (Alyssa Milano, before she hit puberty) and a way with weapons. Any weapons. Whether it's a rifle, knife, grenade, steam pipe, or common household tool (circular saw blades!!!), Matrix uses it to fell entire legions of men singlehandedly.
Just don't tell the LAPD he's back in town. They might want to talk to him about a couple of murders (one of which was witnessed!), carjacking, kidnapping, breaking and entering (with a Caterpillar tractor!!!), grand theft auto, about 100 counts of reckless driving, and, oh yes...using a rocket launcher to blow up a paddy wagon.
There's also the federal beefs, such as jumping off an airborne jumbo jet with no parachute. And the State Department might want to ask him why he decided to singlehandedly decimate the standing army of a foreign country.
But I digress...
It's all here...the classic Ahnuld one-liners (""Blow off some steam"" is my favorite), entire armies of men who shoot millions of rounds at him (and all miss), and scenes of gratuitious muscle-flexing (don't think that rowboat scene happened by accident, folks).
What's not here, of course, is the intelligence, visual flair, and eye-popping special effects that made subsequent Schwarzenegger films like ""Predator,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Terminator 2,"" and ""True Lies"" something more than a mindless (but fun) moviegoing exercise.
But in its own way, ""Commando,"" with its cheesy production values and continuity brain farts (the Porsche that fixed itself after being rolled comes to mind), plays far better than any of the bloated, by-the-numbers movies made after ""True Lies.""
The reason, of course, is Schwarzenegger himself. He's no Robert De Niro-we're talking about an actor whose best role was playing a robot-but few stars have his charisma. That's what separates ""Commando"" from competitors of its day (Chuck Norris movies like ""Delta Force"" come to mind), and makes it a winner 17 years later.",1015200000,14,2160,5.156695156695156

The movie was one of the first of his to concentrate on his acting ability with body image secondary unlike the early Conan movies.  The movie moves along well with few breaks in the action and is mostly accurate with ammunition usage and stunts etc.  But only the enthusiastic gun-nuts and fussy viewers will pay any attention to those points and they are very small points, it doesnt detract from the movies appeal and has never stopped me enjoying it
In addition to the action the movie does have several very humerous components and it is not a single joke movie there are several very funny incidents and funny comments so don't take your attention off the screen.
One point I was saddened to see is the movie has been censored somewhat on the DVD version, only seconds ( approx 3 ) are missing but to those of us who are old enough to have previously seen it uncut it is noticeable.  Nothing major is missing and certainly nothing that a first time viewer will notice as it doesnt detract from the overall appeal of the movie.
Overall I rate this movie as one of my all time favorite action movies and recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed True Lies, Predator or either of the Terminator movies.

`Commando' casts Arnie as your basic unstoppable one-man war machine, aping the trend initiated by Stallone's famous alter-ego, John Rambo. However, where quite a few of the more over-the-top moments in the `Rambo' trilogy stretch the plausibility factor to new lengths, `Commando' shatters it into a million pieces! Watch America's fave Austrian import land in a marsh without a scratch after jumping from an airliner sans parachute! Catch him ripping phone booths right out of their foundations... and throwing them a pretty good distance, too! See him dodge machine-gun rounds fired by dozens of goon-squad soldiers who are no less than five whole feet away (gasp! Now THAT'S cuttin' it close!) from him in some instances!

'Commando' is an  extremely enjoyable, very silly action film in the mould of 'The A-Team',  but with more violence. Anybody who remembers the old arcade game  'Operation Wolf' (the one with the Uzi on the cabinet) will know this film.  It's precisely the kind of thing that kids love - Arnold Schwarzenegger  mowing down crowds of the same group of extras with a big machine-gun,  essentially - done with a tongue so firmly rammed into its cheek that it's  very hard to be offended. Action films nowadays are much more wholesome,  and 'Commando' belongs firmly in another era, but it's still good fun,  especially if you're slightly drunk and / or with a group of friends.",966816000,,946,4.880503144654088
273900,2,6300248089,"Hey I'm an Arnold fan, and I gues it's a reasonable action movie.  But  don't expect to much from the special effects, (cheesy) or the acting  (awfull), or the storyline (very thin).",965174400,,182,4.625
273901,5,6300248089,"Commando does for action movies in the 1980's what The Dirty Dozen did for the same genre in the 1960's. It totally reinvented it. First of all, you can't take it seriously like so many critics have, because it's so  hilariously absurd. The bad guys, and I like to refer to them as ""the  bad guys"" since they are perfect comic book material, kidnap  Schwarzenegger's daughter and he goes to get her back. In the process he  shoots about 500 guys all by himself and comes out with a single shrapnel  wound and his daughter. Lots of machine guns, grenades, stabbings, tons of  shooting, stuff blowing up constantly every couple minutes - all that's  here in rapid fire progression, so there is NEVER one dull minute.  Schwarzenegger also delivers some terrific one-liners, as other viewers  have mentioned.
  One of the really great things about Commando is the  actors. While not an actor's movie, like JFK or Hoffa, the actors really do  a good job. Dan Hedaya is sadistically inept - probably more inept than the  bad guys in Last Action Hero. The first four or five that he kills are the  most stumbling, fumbling serious looking villains I've seen on film.
  Other attractions: Arnie gets wiped out by a car while running through a  mall parking lot and gets back up via his momentum and contiunues running!  Arnie jumps out of an airplane into a swamp while in air! Arnie punches  the, I guess, dashboard of an airplane - and makes it magically lift up in  time to clear a boat after an uzi battle! Arnie also swings from the  rafters of a shopping mall like Tarzan with somebody shooting at him. Then  he chases the guy into a phone booth, picks it up, and press slams it!
  If you're an action film fan, there is NO going wrong with Commando - it  will satisfy the hardest to satisfy for action.",963100800,2,1801,4.5327102803738315
273902,4,6300248089,"Yes, this is a cheesy 80s action movies, but most of them were made like that back then.  ALL of Arnold's were in those days.
The ridiculous action in this movie is laughable.  Hundreds of bad guys shooting thousands  of bullets at him and none of them hit.  Meanwhile, Arnold's picking them  off one by one.  It's great!
The villains are all melodramatic and their  acting's almost as bad as Arnold's.  But still, I have to love this movie!  Arnold carrying a tree with one arm.  Arnold pushing a huge truck down a  hill.  Arnold interrogating a bad guy while dangling him upside down over a  cliff by one leg.
We also get to see an early movie appearance by Alyssa  Milano.
If you can laugh at the cheese and the bad acting, this is a very  enjoyable action movie.",960422400,6,766,4.371428571428571

273904,1,6300248089,"I couldn't figure out whether to give this movie 1 or 5 stars;either one would fit it just fine.
""Commando"" is without adoubt the pinnacle of bad-movie-making.
From all of Arnold's one-liners to never-ending ammo belts to literal swarms of mexican guardsmen who cant hit ONE(1) target with thousands upon thousands of hyper-velocity slugs, this movie HAS to go down in cinematic history as THE most mind-numbingly moronic, idiotic, cheesey, grotesquely fake action movie EVER.
One of the ""best"" parts of the movie was when Arnold's character blew up an entire coastal complex with 2 claymores. I don't have to go into that because anyone who knows their explosives knows what a claymore does and doesn't do.
""John Matrix."" Damn.
I swear to God, a three-year-old could come up with a more realistic name...
When it comes down to it, ""Commando"" should be owned by all who have a stressful job, need some release, or just want to laugh until it hurts.

273905,3,6300248089,"One of the best action films of the eighties, ""Commando"" would seem simply infantile if it were made today. It would not even qualify as a ""direct-to-video"" release. The dialogue is abysmal and provides  some unintentional amusement. The performances are sub-average, as one  would expect from this type of film. The plot is nonsense. The campy  villains are strictly comic-book cut-outs. The final scene (Arnie's  infiltration of the Latin American island fortress and his blowing away  every scumbag that gets in his way) still thrills, however, and, if one may  say so, rises from the ridiculous to the sublime.",958694400,,614,5.151515151515151

From Arnie pushing his truck over a cliff to the  infamous ""He's dead tired!"" line on a plane after smashing a  villain's face in, the film rockets into action almost every second. Arnie  is top notch as always, especially when blowing away baddies towards the  end of the flick (listen to those scrawny screams of soldiers as they are  blown ten feet into the air). The stunts are spectacular, the action is  terrific and even the musical score by James Horner fits the bill in this  overblown action epic. Definately worth a look.

274039,5,6300248089,"For all of you who think that there isn't a great action movie from the eighties.  I bring you the best. Commando is a non stop action fest that breaks necks from start to finish. Headed by vetaran oscar caliber  perfomances by Bill Duke and Dan Hedaya, this movie showcases the madness a  man can endure when his most precious gift, his daughter has been  kidnapped.  Would you honestly want this guy after you !  I sure as heck  wouldn't.  Arnie is throughly ripped and rips apart guys he does.  The most  climatic scene in the flick is when Arnie pushes his 82' Ford Bronco (I  think OJ borrowed this one!)off a cliff and hops in when it has no brakes  and isn't even on !  The bronco chase is amazing and puts the car chases of  Ronin and JADE to shame !  Absolutely a textbook case of how action movies  should be made !  The part where Arnie jumps out of a flying airplane is  amazing for it's time!  There are also classic lines in this  flick, some said by not even Arnie! I'll do my best to fit in a few: Bill  DUKe: ""You know what i love best about cars ? "" Salesman : WHAT  ? DUKE: ""THE PRICe..""
Another classic is the hilarious Car  Salesman: ""G'head! Start her UP!"" ARnie after breaking a man's  neck on the plane: ""Please could you not disturb my friend ? He's dead  TIRED.""  And i will conclude the lines with his classic. After  impaling his enemy with a pipe: ""Blow off some steam Benett.""
  To wrap things up, I will say that this is the greatest action  movie ever made, Arnie is the greatest action hero ever. And the story is  so taught and gripping, the violence is only secondary to this amazing  story line! This movie is WAY SMART, not for dummies !  To yourself a  favor and rent this one immediately ! Just ask for Arnie's greatest  movie!",953251200,4,1766,4.248484848484848

All that  aside, I've seen ""Commando"" about eight times now, and like it  immensely. It is the perfect film for when you want something exciting to  watch that wouldn't tax the intelligence of a carpet slug and which will  make the most damaged intellect smile and then laugh out loud.

Schwarzenegger was cast as John Matrix, a commando who must rescue his daughter Jenny from a Latin American dictator in Val Verde.
The fictitious Latin American country Val Varde was also featured in Die Hard 2(1990). The film mixes ultra-violent action with laugh out loud humor. There's references to The Terminator(1984) such as ""I'll be back, Bennett!"" Rae Dawn Chong is really good as Cindy, an airline stewardess who helps Matrix save his daughter. Some people love the over the top baddie Bennett. The ABC TV version of Commando was heavily recut to tone down the violence. The late Bill Paxton appears in the film. The late James Horner composed some good music for the film. Your ears will hear a lot of steel drums! A Russian guy made his own Commando remake in 2008. There was a short lived toy line based on the movie Commando. A John Matrix action figure would be neat. This movie has no relation to the 8 bit Nintendo game Commando.
