5037525,5,B006YTGLBS,"My 2 year old is obsessed with fire trucks, helicopters, and water! These videos have all 3 so needless to say, I have seen the entire video a bazillion times. He watches at least a portion of it daily and he loves it! :)  I love that the episodes are in short little 10-12 minute increments so they are perfect for the attention span of a toddler.",1344297600,4,348,4.1940298507462686
5037526,5,B006YTGLBS,"This movie is great, came within days of my order in packaging with no issues. We love the ten-12 minute segments and they are great shows.",1336953600,,139,4.384615384615385
5037527,5,B006YTGLBS,"My boys (3 and 5) love Fireman Sam and this DVD is a hit with them.  It features six adventure-filled episodes.  We have seen some of the episodes before but they never get old and my boys love that they can watch them whenever they want!  The episodes teach great lessons such as community members working together, safety, responsibility, patience and what to do in some emergency situations.  Appropriate fro preschoolers!",1335052800,,425,4.943661971830986
5037528,5,B006YTGLBS,"Another great Fireman Sam video! My 3 yr old boy loves this series and I don't mind watching/listening to them over (and over, and over and over!) again either. The best part is they are clean and non-violent with cool rescue stuff!
We have all of them :)",1333670400,,255,4.333333333333333
5037529,3,B006YTGLBS,"Seeing the cover, the first thing out of my toddler's mouth was I want to watch the whale! Jump in and check out this inexpensive DVD with six episodes and nearly an hour of fun. Each story tells examples of nature and knowledge in this port town. Learn about community helpers that come to the rescue and aid when in need. Gain responsibility from character examples and understand not to go off alone into danger. The animation is fun and the characters friendly. While not all the child character voices are pleasing to the ear, the morals herein are worth every minute of watching.

My toddler loves it and I approve.

*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*",1333497600,3,681,4.619834710743802
5037530,5,B006YTGLBS,"Ordered for my grandson (almost 3) and it met all expectations!
He loved it and watches it over and over again.

Would highly recommend!

5037540,4,B006YTGLBS,"I didn't purchase this item, it was a Prime Free Movie choice.  My 4-yr-old granddaughter love Fireman Sam and we searched the internet for episode length videos to no avail, they were mostly 1-3 minutes long.  Then I went to Amazon Prime Instant Videos and there was a long list of free instant videos.  She picked the one she wanted to watch and sat mesmerized for 45 minutes with three episodes in one.  Her review was, ""Gramma that was wonderful, amazing"" - says it all for us!",1391299200,,481,4.494252873563219

5037546,5,B006YTGLBS,"Oh Norman, my son enjoys your shenanigans. On a side note, I honestly wish I could just give the shows my family watches adequate stars and be done with it. Sorry Amazon, this isn't a conventional purchase. I like the show, so why am I required to go into great detail once I've given it 4 stars?",1386979200,,296,4.2105263157894735

5037553,3,B006YTGLBS,"My son loves Fireman Sam.....he loves anything to do with fire-rescue.  He has watched a few episodes and loves it...but I do notice he has a hard time understanding that British accent. He is 3 years old and understans all his shows with ease (Dora the explorer, wow wow Wubzy, Diego, etc) but this particular series is hard for an American english speaking child living in the states to understand. Just my opinion. No wonder he lost interest and is just watching his other shows.",1362787200,,482,4.670588235294118
