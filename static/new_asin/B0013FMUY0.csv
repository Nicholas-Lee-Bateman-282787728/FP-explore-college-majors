I have to agree with the other reveiws that this is not really set up for the beginner, more for the Intermediate level. But- if you are already learning zills & still at the beginner level (as I am), I have found that by working with this DVD as a practice tool, (though challenging) it is helping me as a beginner to stretch my skills and dexterity, as well as improve my ability to move & play at the same time. I find for myself with learning the zills, you just have to jump in & work at it. Pushing yourself a bit more each time and before you know it, you are doing it! .....so if you are like-minded beginner, I would recommend this DVD to you too.",1384473600,,773,4.0588235294117645
8330694,4,B0013FMUY0,I enjoy this DVD very much.  Love the four part rotation of the dancers. This lets you see each one's personality.  Highly recommended.,1289433600,,135,4.826086956521739
8330695,5,B0013FMUY0,"I really like this DVD.  The DVD is broken down into sections and the choreography is taught by all four members one at a time.  They are all facing the mirror so it's easy to follow along.  I love the song.  It's cute and fun to listen to.  I would not have bought this DVD had it not been for the other two reviews and I'm glad I can give this DVD a 5 star rating as well.  One small negative was that when Zylona taught her part, I wish she was wearing a colored hip scarf like the other ladies as opposed to black.  It would have made it easier to see the movements.  She messed up on the combination, but that's okay.  Also, although they are facing the mirror, the camera doesn't show their feet as much.  However, it is an excellent DVD, great quality, nice choreography with veil and zills, and wonderful instruction.  You also get to see them perfom this as a troupe too.  Not for beginners.  Intermediate/Advance.",1277510400,2,923,4.296511627906977
8330696,5,B0013FMUY0,"I am always looking for great dvd choreographies, but the showstoppers are few and far between! This is by far one of the best I have seen. It is a crowd pleaser and simple to learn. It is intermediate, but doesn't have a bunch of complicated turns etc... Sahira, a member of the group also has two other choreography dvd's that are also wonderful. I wrote her personally concerning some questions I had about the dvd and she was extremely helpful. Also, the fact that each member teaches their own section somehow gets the combos into your brain faster and easier. I highly recommend this dvd and the choreography!!!! Great Job Bella Donna!!!",1260403200,,643,4.699115044247788
8330697,5,B0013FMUY0,"This video is wonderful if you are looking for new performance choreography.  If you want to perform a solo or a group troupe, this is excellent.  The DVD is broken down into sections.  The dancers show you step by step the entire chroegraphy. You will have a front and back view of all the steps.  If you practice everyday for about a week, you will have it mastered.  I would not suggest this video for a beginner unless they are advanced to the point of solo performance with props.",1235692800,3,485,4.404494382022472
