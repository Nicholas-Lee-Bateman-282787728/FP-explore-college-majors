5795333,4,B00DERONLS,"Rienzi is the ""last"" of Wagner's early works and outside the 10 opera ""cannon""...This production is ""untraditional"" which for us not familiar with the full opera and only know it from its famous overture and excerpts, it had to be followed closely to ""get it"". For me, I considered it more an introduction to a work that I had little to judge it against...and an worthly introduction.",1391558400,,384,4.746268656716418
5795334,4,B00DERONLS,"This early piece is very Italianate with long, flowing melodies and stirring arias.  It is very well sung.  The Rienzi himself, Torsten Kerl, sounds like a true heldentenor, but plays the character not as the conflicted hero Wagner intended but as an insufferably smug demagogue.  The director is almost certainly to blame.  The women are splendid.",1389052800,,348,5.160714285714286
5795335,5,B00DERONLS,"This performance, which has few cuts, is far superior to the Berlin version. In spite of the opera's origin in French grand opera, this French production is tastefully and simply staged in a manner that translates well into video; there is no need for constant cutting back and forth among cameras. I have no idea why the cover shows a ridiculous medieval grim reaper out of Bergman's Seventh Seal, which has nothing to do with the staging in this production. Steinberg's orchestra is excellent and does not overwhelm the singers. Kerl owns the role of Rienzi and here he is in superb form. The other singers are fine too, but this opera rises and falls with the tenor, who is on stage almost constantly.

The compositional flaws in this early work by Wagner are well known and are not factored into my rating. The completely uncut version of the existing score is unperformable on stage unless two tenors do a tag-team Rienzi. The composer's even longer autograph score disappeared from Hitler's final bunker. Oddly, it was as a young man that der Fuehrer became obsessed with this opera. Maybe he learned from Rienzi's mistakes never to pardon a competitor or an enemy.

I saw the rival Berlin production in person, also featuring Kerl, and I have no wish to see it again. That production (specifically the staging with a dozen TV screens playing miscellaneous fascist newsreels in the background) was roundly booed by the audience and I shudder to think how it would look on video. Its only redeeming virtue was that it was greatly shortened by scene cuts; avoid it.",1386288000,3,1569,4.785977859778598
5795336,5,B00DERONLS,"This is a very enjoyable and stirring performance of this problematic work. The tenor is excellent and the rest of the case does a very fine job. The staging is minimal, but at least we are spared the unnecessary clutter of some current productions. As compared to the other DVD version from Berlin, this is much better, as one can concentrate on the music and follow the story without worrying as to what they are trying to tell us. Torsten Kerl apparently owns this role, and here he can give a more varied dramatic interpretation than in the Berlin Hitlerian version. The Adriano in the Berlin performance is however, better. as the one here, is a little too mature to play an impetuous young man, and is more restrained vocally.
It is very unlikely that another version will one out, so this is the one to get.",1385164800,4,814,4.54421768707483
5795337,4,B00DERONLS,"For years I've been fascinated by this earlier ""grand"" opera by Wagner, collecting CD and LP recordings of it. None of them are, of course, complete. The closest to complete, I venture, is the 1976 EMI under Heinrich Hollreiser (with Rene Kollo), but even that one is cut. Other Rienzis of interest include those featuring Max Lorenz (1941, on Preiser), Gunther Treptow (1950, on Urania), the incredible Wolfgang Windgassen (1957, Stuttgart, on Living Stage), Set Svanholm (1960, Vienna, Melodram), and a later Kollo essay under Sawallisch (Orfeo,1983). Of course, the great Lauritz Melchior sang Rienzi's prayer, ""Almacht'ger Gott"" on various occasions. This present DVD and BD release ( Capitole de Toulouse) certainly has many things going for it, most notably the clarion vocalism of Torsten Kerl, who impresses me with his clean and lyrical approach to the demanding role. I could certainly see Kerl doing other Wagner works; he seems to combine the silvery fresh tone of  Windgassen with the stamina of, say, Hans Hopf (on a good day!). The rest of the cast sings commendably.

The staging is a curious mix of modern and traditional elements. There is enough in the mise en scene to relate to what is actually going on in the text. At least, we don't have to put up with the extremes of ""Eurotrash."" Still, it would be interesting to see a well-done production fitted exactly to the period.

I was disappointed not to have more than a brief synopsis of the opera in the enclosed booklet. Indeed, there is no listing of cueing points (one can go to the two DVDs to see the listing, but it is important to have them in the booklet, as well). While one can find a libretto, not having the cueing points in the booklets is a serious disadvantage.

Also, the Second Act musique de ballet/divertissement is cut in its entirety. I've always believed that Wagner, in his early period, out Meyerbeered Meyerbeer, and the dance sequences, I believe, add to Wagner's realization of this work as true ""grand"" opera. The omission of the ballet is regrettable.  (The Hollreiser includes the ballet/dance sequences; while this present DVD comes in at around 176 minutes, the Hollreiser is about 218 minutes in length).

But I don't want to be too critical. As I wrote, the singing, especially the work of Kerl, is quite good, and just how many other filmed Rienzis will show up?  So, I do recommend this DVD. If you love grand opera or are interested in early Wagner, this two-DVD set is certainly worth it.",1382313600,11,2498,4.822429906542056
5795338,4,B00DERONLS,"Amidst the abundance of Ring cycles being wheeled out this year, the Wagner bicentenary has also provided a good opportunity to revisit and reconsider many of the composer's earliest works. If any of them is likely to be reevaluated as a misunderstood and neglected masterpiece, it's possibly Rienzi with the promise of that wonderful Overture that asserts itself on occasion like a leitmotif throughout the work. If it never quite manages to live up to what we expect of a Wagner opera though, there are nonetheless fascinating hints of the style that would develop in the composer's later music-dramas and this is something that is brought out very skillfully in this 2012 production from the Thtre du Capitole in Toulouse.

The production here opens with some images during the Overture of the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as other popular uprisings around the world, but there are no other modern references to be found in this production, which settles thereafter for a more generalised non-specific period, but one that has echoes to Wagner's own time. The Overture is all about setting the tone, and this one succeeds in bringing it back closer to the sentiments and intentions of the original work. As fascinating as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philipp-Stltzl-s-Deutsche-Oper-production/dp/B003X8597K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philipp Stltzl's Deutsche Oper production</a>&nbsp;was in relating the work to its historical legacy (most notoriously as Hitler's favourite opera), this production takes it back to Wagner's left-wing leanings and the revolutionary activities on the streets of Dresden that would see him forced into exile for a significant part of his life. This is a Rienzi that is still concerned about the nature and the exercise of power, but Wagner's position as a revolutionary on the side of the ordinary citizen - most evident in the huge choruses - is more clearly drawn here.

If the musical treatment and the theatrical intent are quite different from Stltzl's, this production is nonetheless still very much stylised in its own way. Closer to the 19th century than medieval Rome (or indeed the Third Reich), the panstick-whitened faces remind one of a futuristic silent movie like Metropolis. In its striving for an ideal society that rules with benevolence and with balance for the needs of its people, this might not be far off the mark in striking the right tone for Rienzi. There is nothing as visually striking as Metropolis in this minimally decorated production but that's not to say that the production doesn't hold attention. The costumes are appropriate, define the characters well and succeed in setting the ordinary people apart from the uniformly-dressed political factions (you can scarcely distinguish between the Orsini and the Colonna, which is perhaps the intention). The lighting is superb and the production works well enough to bring across what can be a fairly static opera largely comprised of solemn pronouncements and declarations.

The singing too commands attention. The vocal writing is less bel canto in Rienzi than in Wagner's previous work, the Bellini-influenced Das Liebesverbot, but the roles are no less demanding on the singers, pointing towards the style of expression and continual flow that is found in later Wagner works. All of the singers deal with the demands exceptionally well, if not always with a great sense of personality, but then the characterisation is somewhat limited in this work. Torsten Kerl has made the role of Cola di Rienzi something of his own and he brings out a more human side to the character here. Marika Schnberg is a good Irene, but doesn't make as much of an impression in the role as Camilla Nyberg did in the Deutsche Oper production. In the trouser role of Adriano, mezzo-soprano Daniela Sindram however probably gives the stand-out performance, with a deep, soaring and expressive delivery that helps considerably in bringing some much needed life to the work.

The BD is of the usual high standard and comes with almost an hour's worth of interviews with the production team and the singers. Torsten Kerl deals quite frankly with the thorny issues of Wagner's controversial position and with the work's legacy in the Nazi era, but there are also interesting thoughts on the value of the work itself and the difficulties of performing it from the conductor and director. The BD is full-HD, dual-layer BD50, region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German and Korean.",1377216000,20,4529,5.268698060941828

5795341,5,B00DERONLS,"I could have taken one star away ffor the production, which made no sense whatsoever to my eyes.  But the glorious performance and the beauty of the music are more than enough to merit five stars.  The principals were all excellent.  Everyone seems to ""hear"" Mayerbeer in the music; I distinctly heard echoes of Weber!  A must for all opera lovers.",1431043200,,348,4.655737704918033
5795342,5,B00DERONLS,"Never heard anything of Rienzi before except for the overture and the prayer. Really enjoyed the performances of the two leads. The interviews with conductor, star, producer were also fascinating. One oddity, the excellent cover photo of a cowled figure with sword never appeared in the production at all, so a bit of cheat there. However, the costumes were distinctive and not a distraction. The sets were enhanced by terrific lighting effects. Musically excellent, considering it's a French orchestra playing Wagner, and the choruses were performed top notch. Great to see Rienzi ride on stage on a real horse. The horse was a star too. It flicked its ears at some of the chorus singing, but didn't budge until it was meant to. I'll watch this again, pretty soon.",1427587200,,765,4.937984496124031
5795343,4,B00DERONLS,"It was very good great singers, overall.  Marika Shonberg was very stiff, and seemed to have a bit of trouble having the right volume in the duets.  Everyone was else was just wonderful.  The la Scala chorus deserves especial mention.  They are just amazing.  And apparently there are at times more than 90 singers on stage at once.

The mise-en-scene worked, I thought.  Although it's set in the Roman time period there is nothing about the plot that locks it into that setting.  It's very allegorical, and seems to eschew specific historical references on purpose in favor of a more philosophical narrative.  And it's narrative that certainly has something to say into the modern day, although I gather the people it most directly speaks to, don't pick up on it, given that despite the whole thrust being anti-dictatorial and about the corrupting influence of power, it was nevertheless Hitler's favorite opera.

I understand that this is the most complete recording of the opera on DVD, with primarily the ballet being cut.  The ballet retells the Rape of Lucretia, and seems to me to be only tenuously related to the plot (both stories result in the overthrow of a dictator) and even less related to the music (you can hear the ballet on youtube, and it is very typical ballet music nothing particularly special).  The pantomime that was cut and was about foreign reaction to Rienzi's rule (I guess?  I'm going based on the DVD extras) sounds more interesting.

The extras are also worth mentioning.  40 minutes of interviews.  wonderful.  I wish every opera DVD had that.  I really wish my la Scala Ring cycle had it.",1427414400,2,1622,4.815217391304348

5795346,5,B00DERONLS,"I wasn't sure how I would respond to the staging of this opera.  I was afraid it would be  Euro-trash.  I decided to keep an open mind.  It worked for me.  Once you get over the initial shock of how strange a lot of ""white"" faces look.  The singing is excellent, as is the BR clarity and sound.  Torsten Kerl and Daniela Sindram are forces to be reckoned with.  There are not many dvd's of Rienzi to compare this to.  I don't usually like modern versions of operas, but this one impressed me with its quality of singing and acting.  You can definitely see the direction Wagner was going in this opera.  There was only one thing that I thought was strange; everyone in the opera wears white face makeup, except one black man.  If you like/love Wagner, you will like this BR.  Highly recommended!",1399507200,,794,4.393103448275862
5795347,4,B00DERONLS,"Before someone reports me to Amazon, let me point out that ""Grosser querschnitt"" is German for ""highlights"" (literally ""greater cross-section"").

Wagner conceived Rienzi for the Paris Opera, with lots of choruses and ballet music, which the French insisted on.
The actual premiere was in Dresden in 1842.
Rienzi lasted about six hours.

Subsequent performances shortened it considerably.
The original score was lost in a World War II bombing raid.
A roughly two-and-a-half hour version was thought to be all that survived - until the 1970s when musicologists pieced together an additional two hours from surviving fragments.
This was the basis for the BBC's pioneering 4 hour, 40 minute broadcast in 1976, the single most important performance of the opera since 1842.

[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

There are two competing performances on Blu-Ray, both featuring Torsten Kerl in the title role:

2010: 2 hours, 36 minutes = Berlin Opera conducted by Sebastian Lang-Lessing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Rienzi-Blu-ray/dp/B003X8597K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Rienzi [Blu-ray</a>]

2013: 2 hours, 56 minutes = Toulouse Thatre du Capitole conducted by Pinchas Steinberg: The Blu-Ray under review.

(actual timings are less due to curtain calls and production credits)

Rienzi was Wagner's most popular opera during his lifetime.
Adolf Hitler may have inadvertently killed Rienzi when word got out that it was his favorite opera.
This seems unfair:
After the war, his valet reported that Hitler's favorite movie was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""
yet Snow White seems to have survived unscathed.

Though he lived in Italy in the Fourteenth Century, poor Rienzi has suffered for his supposed Nazi connection.
An irresistable temptation for trendy opera directors with a keen grasp of the obvious.
The 2010 Berlin performance is especially clueless.
Silly, really.

The 2013 Toulouse Thatre performance is more abstract in its staging, therefore
Less Silly.

- Toulouse has twenty minutes more music than Berlin.
- Toulouse has smarter staging than Berlin.
- Toulouse has a 55 minute documentary vs. 26 minutes in Berlin.
- Both Blu-Rays have the same tenor in the lead role.
- Both Blu-Rays have 5.1 surround sound and subtitles in all the usual languages.

If you need Rienzi on Blu-Ray, Toulouse Thatre du Capitole is my recommendation.

However, there is always a catch, and that's where Grosser querschnitt comes in.
Both Blu-Rays are heavily cut.

I wouldn't mind it if Opera Houses wanted to present abridged performances, if only ONE uncut Rienzi was available on CD or DVD/Blu-Ray.
CD recordings ranged from 1 hour, 58 minutes to 3 hours, 38 minutes.

The 4 hour, 40 minute BBC broadcast under Edward Downes, with John Mitchison as Rienzi, used to be available as a 4 CD set on the Italian label Ponto,
but unfortunately Ponto forgot to get the BBC's permission and the CDs have been withdrawn.

The Ponto version of the Downes/BBC Rienzi is available as a download (6 euros) on opera-club.net
Recommended as a stopgap.
And if the BBC ever decides on an official release, I hope they don't forget the libretto and translation
(now that I'm at it, I wouldn't sneeze at a new uncut recording conducted by Barenboim, Janowski or Thielemann).

For the time being, your best bet is Hollreiser/EMI, with Rene Kollo as Rienzi, the longest of available performances, at 3 hours, 38 minutes.

For the sorry recorded history of Rienzi, see my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Rienzi/dp/B00GU40HK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Rienzi</a>&nbsp;(""Wagner's Rienzi: Discography"", dated May 4, 2014).",1399161600,17,3795,5.536332179930795
5795348,2,B00DERONLS,"Last May I had the opportunity to see Rienzi on the stage of the Opera in Rome. It was thrilling and the music glorious. Thus it was great interest that I read the recent  review of this disc in Opera News and rushed to purchase it. I played it immediately and only afterwards read the apologetic drivel written Jorge Lavelli at the front of the booklet that accompanies the discs. And finally  I read the six reviews that were available on Amazon.

I cannot help but think that the director and the reviewers have missed two important points. The first is that the director has used public monies to put forth his view of the action rather than that of Wagner. It is the fact that public monies are available that underlies so many of today mistaken productions. Once the money is allocated and the director is chosen, no public watch-dog is looking to see how the money is spent. The second is that the action takes place in Rome, a local that is infused with light rather than the abstract darkness which permeates the entire opera. The darkness of this production is not alleviated by the died red hair of Rienzi, the red robes of the clergy or the red dress that Irene puts on later in the action.

Who loses from these limitations? The public which has never seen this opera and  may not know that this is not the way Wagner proposed that it be staged. Granted that it is a problematic opera in that it is not a drawing room comedy with one stage set to fill all acts, but the near total lack of scenery, the stark staging and the even starker lighting, and the pasty white make up all make for a hard view no matter how good the singing is and it is good.

I will listen to it again because it does give one the opportunity to hear beautiful singing, but I am saddened to think that this is the best that we can do with an opera set in ancient times.",1396656000,9,1857,4.291428571428572

8592660,4,B00DERONLS,"This is a review of the Steinberg recording on DVD. Up front I'll say that I enjoyed it, have watched it several times, and having seen it, I would buy it again. The audio and video reproduction are both excellent, and I have nothing but praise for the soloists, chorus, and orchestra. this is a very solid performance of Rienzi - or at least a markedly cut version of it. Now for my critiques.

1. As can be ascertained from by above comment, this production has had some fairly serious cuts made to the score. At 176 minutes, it comes in at more than 100 minutes shorter than the Downes/BBC ""complete"" audio recording. Even factoring out the roughly 40 minute ballet (perhaps not a serious loss in a 21st century staged production), that leaves roughly 60 minutes of the score on the cutting room floor. If you are unfamiliar with Rienzi, this would probably have no effect on your enjoyment of the opera; the narrative certainly works well enough even with the cuts. But if you are a Wagnarian looking for the Holy Grail of a ""mostly uncut"" production, this will not be a successful quest.

2. The staging is just plain silly. Rienzi was written to be a ""grand"" opera, filled with spectacle, huge sets, spectacular costumes, etc. This production could not be further from that if it tried. The ""set"" is a large, ""made to look like metal"" grey box with various doors that open at various times. No columns, no arches, no churches - in fact noting to indicate you are even in Rome. Apparently the design was to strip virtually all color from the stage. Except for Irene's inexplicable bright red dress and the red costumes of the clergy the entire stage looks as though someone slid the ""saturation tab"" almost all the way to the left. The bizarre use of white-face makeup on the entire cast only adds to this. The only hints of color come from the washed-out costumes of the ""commoners"". There is little to no coherency in the overall costume design. Rienzi is always in solid black, sometimes with a ""stylish"" black leather jackt, sometimes with a chrome breastplate, sometimes a black one, sometimes with a black cape, and sometimes with a ""chain mail"" tee-shirt showing. The Commoners are wearing a style that could be best describes as ""generic 19th century Euro-opera peasant"", the nobles all look like they stepped out of B&W photo spread in recent issue of ""GQ"", the soldiers look like monochrome bell-hops, and Irene spends the entire production in the same red dress that may have come from Bridesmaids-R-Us.  But at least all of the production choices are bland enough that you can still enjoy the music despite them as opposed to some of the crazy Euro-trash productions that seem to be in vogue these days.

As I said up front, despite my critiques, this is still a production worth seeing, and it is certainly better to have a slightly flawed production than none at all.",1495324800,2,2886,4.675196850393701
8592661,2,B00DERONLS,"To echo another's remark the overture (magnificent) was the best part. The set design, if you can even call it that, was hideous; the make up even worse. Torsten Kerl has an excellent voice but destroys the character of the Tribune by playing the smug dictator and manipulator. The Director's fault, probably deliberate sabotage of Wagner's work. The magnificent overture and soaring arias are wasted in this production, where modern politics set out to destroy Wagner's work. We must continue to expect to see this kind of sabotage of Wagner, especially Rienzi, when it performed at all. After all, it was ""You know Who's"" favorite opera.
