7928718,4,B0000507PT,"This video actually contains two fairly short programs. The first looks at a series of rescues at sea using actual footage. The second examines the USCG rescue swimmers and also has footage from actual rescues as well as of interviews with swimmers and an examination of the history of the program and its training.

The first program is not particularly exciting. It shows some rescue footage but is really rather dry. This is a shame since these people, the USCG, put their lives on the line to help people in dire straits. I came away from this program with a healthy respect for their motivation and dedication but, as I said, the footage was not too great.

The program dealing with rescue swimmers is actually much more interesting. It too contains footage of actual rescues but it also looks at the training program for the rescuers. Apparently, the job is one of the most coveted in the USCG. You cannot help but have a tremendous amount of respect for these people and wonder what makes them WANT to do this.",1119484800,2,1017,4.644444444444445
7928719,5,B0000507PT,We enjoyed the movie but this was even better.  Meeting the real people  behind actual rescues was interesting and I learned alot about boating and  how the Coast Guard finds people in trouble.  Don't miss it!,962582400,2,209,4.722222222222222
