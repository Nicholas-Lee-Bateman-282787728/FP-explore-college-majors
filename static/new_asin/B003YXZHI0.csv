The second time I, purchased it on OCT.'12 & Amazon.com directed me to another vendor, well guess what, it was the same thing it was NOT made to work in USA DVD players. I, have one startling Question why do companies SELL products to us when they are NOT made to either work or play in the USA. It causes more of a HASSLE to get it, find out it does NOT work in the USA. Then I, have to go through a HASSLE to RETURN it & make sure my account is PROPERLY CREDITED !!!! This last I, RETURN is really a big HASSLE, because i'm recieveing 2 different e-mails on how much is to be CREDITED back to me. Before ordering things such as DVD's they should WARN you that this DVD WILL NOT PLAY IN USA MADE DVD PLAYERS !!!!",1351814400,,886,3.9277777777777776

4231836,2,B003YXZHI0,"Like many folks, I had been planning to wait around for a North American release of Steven Seagal's reworked ""True Justice"" TV show before making a purchase, but the fact that it's been almost a year since the Region 2 versions have started to be released, with no mention of a Region 1 edition, has made my anxiousness get the better of me. However, after sitting through ""Deadly Crossing"" - the film comprising the first two episodes of the show - I'm sorry to say that I could've easily waited another year or two for the disappointment. After the welcome novelty that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Seagal-Lawman/dp/B002WSZSNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Seagal: Lawman</a>, it seems like Seagal has already run dry on TV-related junk and is at this point merely broadcasting the same kind of low-budget dreck that you can find in any number of his latter-career movies.

The story: a Seattle task force specializing in undercover work, headed by the veteran Elijah Kane (Seagal), spearheads a Russian drug cartel...

The film's presentation is clean but still somewhat flawed. Whether you approach it as a stand-alone movie or as two back-to-back TV episodes, ""Deadly Crossing"" does a poor job of establishing itself and its characters. In hindsight, it was probably a good idea that this didn't get an episodic TV release: the viewers who'd be watching this would probably already be familiar with shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI/dp/B00008972G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI</a>, and by comparison, these first two episodes of ""True Justice"" are simplistic to the point of boneheadedness. The character relationships and inner dynamics of Kane's team are practically limited to two themes: the female members striving for respect from their male colleagues and absolutely everybody either being a cheerleader for Kane or otherwise getting shown up by him. Not the least bit interesting. The storyline itself isn't terribly intricate, but is presented as juuust complicated enough to be make following it a chore, with too many events falling on top of eachother too fast. Worse yet, there's no payoff, since the story ends up being just another run-of-the-mill police caper with no surprises or major character revelations.

On the bright side, it's nice for a change to see Seagal interact with characters that are presented at least as prominent as he is, even if nothing they say is terribly interesting. A few of the performers seem like they have potential to grow as characters, particularly William Stewart as Kane's right hand man. Seagal himself seems at least partially enthusiastic about his new role, playing up his new Cajun persona and continually dropping lines like ""even a old blind rooster hit a piece of corn once in a while."" He calls people ""white boy"" more than once, but so does the similarly Caucasian Meghan Ory (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-House/dp/B003T04NBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark House</a>). The opening titles play to a Seagal-performed song off his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-From-The-Crystal-Cave/dp/B003156HRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs From The Crystal Cave</a>&nbsp;CD, which is nice. Lastly, I take heart in the fact that Keoni Waxman - director of these two episodes, as well as two of Seagl's DTV features - only directed a handful of others for this series, so perhaps future installments will improve with better directors. In the meantime, we're stuck with some of the uglier trademarks of Steven's low-budget work: an overabundance post-production editing (i.e. every unnecessary throwaway shot features lighting transitions, slow motion, or extreme close-ups), weak shootouts, and stinky hand-to-hand fight scenes with a bit of obvious stunt doubling. At one point, Seagal picks up a katana and slices up a post of some kind, but he doesn't get into any actual swordfights.

About thirty minutes into the movie, I had stopped caring about where the story was headed and was just watching for something cool to happen. Nothing did, sealing this one's low rating. I'm not so jaded yet that I'd say no to the following ""True Justice"" installments, but it's definitely going to wait until they're released in Region 1 format, preferably as a boxed set and with special features. Hang in there, Seagal fans.",1322265600,10,4486,5.701046337817639

4231853,3,B003YXZHI0,"This is the first two episodes of a Canadian TV series where Steven Seagal (minus the pony tail) plays Elijah Kane, a special undercover policeman. Kane leads a group of plains clothes cops who work only the big crimes in Seattle.

In this episode, the Russian mafia is dealing heroin through strip joints and have a run in with Cajuns just to make it interesting...or at least an attempt. Elijah is strong as an ox, has the eyes of an eagle, and sharp like a tack with the wit of a hamster. Yes, the dialouge was bad. It was dry and lacked any cleverness, worse than most TV programs.

However this film isn't all about closeups of Seagal to show case his talents. His crew gets equal time. The problem is we don't know who they are. The first episode should spend time introducing the characters, this one assumes you know who everyone is, except for Sara (Sarah Lind) the ""newbie"" with a ""nice rack."" The film has an interesting ""Witness"" moment which was a plus.

Seattle makes for a nice backdrop along with historic Camp Harmony. This series has been heavily pirated and shows up in a lot of places. I was surprised to see episode 1 and 2 on Redbox.

In later episodes LA gangs are dealing designer drugs through dance clubs. Seagal is the creator and lead writer. I think that speaks for itself.
