8341828,1,B001TKD5UM,"This film was mildly amusing, and had some clever dialog, but it would be offensive, I suspect, to gay people.  It charactures them in a very chiched way.  It is the story of a fashionista who pretends to be gay so that the husbands of his women won't worry about leaving their wives alone with him.  His rivals in the industry are genuinely gay, and have all the limp-wristed characteristics we are expected to accept as authentic.  If you like to see pretty women in their underware, you might enjoy this film.  The women are well-built Mexicans, not the anorexic sorts we see in American fashion magazines.  Be warned that this film is in Spanish and has no subtitles.  Sample line: ""No somos machos, pero somos muchos!""  (We aren't men, but we are many).  Ha ha.  I'm only guessing about the gay reaction to this film.  I'm not gay, so maybe I'm being over-protective.
I bought the DVD through Amazon, and it arrived in good condition, quickly.",1351814400,,948,4.616766467065868
