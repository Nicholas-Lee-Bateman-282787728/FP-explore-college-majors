7872744,4,6304493746,"Elle, practitioner of the Shadow Skill technique, adopts a boy named Gau as her brother and trains him. Gau wants to become powerful enough to beat the legendary Scarface, the champion of Shadow Skill. Not much in the way of story, but it's a good anime nonetheless. The animation is very fluid and the fight scenes have some of the best choreography in any martial arts anime yet. The soundtrack is great, especially the tune that plays while Elle and Gau train atop the mountain. What really disappointed me, though, is that Gau never fights Scarface at the end, and is evidently still too weak to even match him. The main characters fight just for the sake of fighting, so there's really no drive or emotional appeal during the battles, making them less interesting. Despite this, it's fine. Martial arts fans should see this.",992995200,,829,4.763888888888889

This is the beginning of an amazing anime and journey known as Shadow Skill. The main ""actor"" is Gau Ban, a young, silent boy with his older sister, Elle Ragu, who isn't really his sister; she adopted him after his parents were killed. The two are making a journey to visit Gau's parent's graves, to mark his height on a tree to show them how he's grown. Along the way, Gau is trying desperatly to master the art of the Shadow Skill, a skill that was used by the slave women in chains who were forced to defend themselves against their masters, and though he is trying his very hardest, he cannot understand. Though his sister may seem cruel, she wants so badly for Gau to become a Sevalle, and the youngest at that. That's as much as I will tell, the rest of this amazing journey must be discovered through actually seeing Shadow Skill for yourself.
UPDATE: Well, don't I feel stupid. o_O This was a different part of Shadow Skill that I reviewed. Disreguard it to this one, but it is the beginning of another ShadowSkill which is very good. =)",987379200,,1262,4.5152838427947595
