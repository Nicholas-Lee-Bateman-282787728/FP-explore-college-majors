5231514,5,B00911MH14,"Ken Stott is the perfect Rebus, with the supporting cast equally excellent. Shot in and around the beautiful city of Edinburgh, the quality of this program puts to shame many of those films that win the Academy Award. A must for anyone seeking a very rewarding viewing experience that is worth watching every 6 months. Have friends over... they'll love it too.",1419897600,11,360,4.82258064516129

5231527,5,B00911MH14,"Ken Stott was a much better choice for Rebus than John Hannah, but the real star of the show is the city of Edinburgh.",1492646400,,118,3.9583333333333335
5231528,5,B00911MH14,"DI John Rebus the most famous fictional Scottish detective. The books written by Ian Rankin have been turned into a series. Ken Stott seems to be the best representation of the Rebus I know. Rebus is for the underdog, and he will break rules, forget what his superiors ask and do what is right in his eyes,

  Ahhhh, Rebus and his good friend,  DS Siobhan Clarke, work well together.  She is the only one who really understands him.  However, as time does not stand still, Ian Rankin's new character DI Malcom Fox, heading The Ethics and Standards Division' makes his appearance,and he is shocked, shocked,,I tell you, to find Rebus back on the force. He dredges up all the old complaints, none of which went anywhere when Rebus was on the force. The cat and mouse game continues. I actually resented Fox in this novel, at first...

We get to meet Rebus's daughter as he travels to the north of Scotland on this case. He is trying to resurrect their relationship.  We also see a great deal of Scotland, the north country and get to meet the people. This is a time when Scotland is attempting to exert it's independence, and we see the issues from all sides. This is a fascinating study of a man who was let out to pasture, trying to regain his foothold. Rebus has not changed much, his habits remain the same, but I do detect a little empathy in the man. He is trying to  deal with the changes in the workplace and the computerization of his workplace.

Rebus is the man who loves the music, the whiskey, the man who pays little attention to the niceties of life.  There are some tell tale signs that Rebus might be working with his unit again.. He is also privy to every bad duck in Scotland, and can often get them to help him in some cases.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 03-18-17",1489795200,,1782,4.446153846153846

5231531,5,B00911MH14,"I am a fan of the Rebus books and love this!  Even though there are significant differences between this and the books of the Rebus character, this guy is Rebus and as I go from book to video, I am NOT annoyed (which has happened often with video adaptations).  The plots are interesting and engaging.... as soon as I was able to give them a pass for using a book title for the show and then the show plot is NOT at all like the book.  Watch and enjoy!",1476921600,4,452,4.056179775280899

5231560,3,B00911MH14,"I was excited to see this was out on DVD.I have been a fan of Ian Rankin for many years have all the Rebus books,but Ken Stott is not what I picture in my head for Rebus. And he doesn't have the strong accent that they talk about in the books either. He is a very good actor though so maybe the more I watch maybe he'll grow on me!!!",1454025600,2,333,3.7714285714285714

5231565,5,B00911MH14,"Edinburghs DI John Rebus is a male counterpart to Northumberlands DCI Vera. Hes shabby suited, middle age, divorced, a working alcoholic, womanizing cop who works with female cops. Rebus (Ken Stott) is unique in the massive array of UK cops in that he has no stomach for autopsy viewing. Hes assisted by DS Shiobhan Clarke (pronounced Sha-bon) (Claire Price) a young blonde, eager, without a social life. Rebus boss, Chief Super Templar (Jennifer Black), a past Rebus love conquest, now testy with him. Excellent screen chemistry with this trio.
A pleasant surprise, as this series began with Rebus seeming a bit unbelievable as being attractive to females. But the writing is good, acting well done, and after 10 episodes I was disappointed that it ended, no future episodes possible. The series grows in character with each 70 minute episode. Abundant guest stars, below I mention a few.

SDH SUBTITLES provided, including the bonus footage

Gruesome murder scene of a retired doctor has Rebus pondering 1830 copycat or thinking serial. A mini coffin with smiling baby makes it creepy. Siobhan helps untangle dark secrets.

5231566,5,B00911MH14,"Awesome exactly what I wanted and it arrived quicker than expected.  Just the Ken Stott Rebus (I didn't like th other guy as much) he really embodies what I think Rebus should look like and I love seeing Edinburgh again, when I lived there the location for Rebus's psychiatrist was my secret parking spot in the city centre.",1430006400,,324,4.586206896551724
8533615,4,B00911MH14,"I enjoy this series. seeing a different country, landscapes & how people are in another country is also worth it.  Ea story line is a little different so that's good.  Lead characters do a good job.",1530316800,,198,4.472222222222222

8533620,5,B00911MH14,"No two mysteries or mystery series are alike.  Obviously.  Rebus is a police detective.  He is thoughtful, sensitive, tough, at time rebellious.  His character is as central to the interest as the plot although the plots are always well-conceived.  His partner is a straight, by the books, young detective in awe of Rebus but also willing to call him when he steps out of line.  Which he does, often.  This said, Rebus is a thoroughly enjoyable series.",1505520000,,452,4.792207792207792
8533621,5,B00911MH14,Love this series. Ken Stott is perfect. It's not often the film version makes the books more fun to read but this one does. Well worth the purchase!,1504137600,,148,4.321428571428571
8533622,5,B00911MH14,"I ordered this for a friend in the states, because she said that she & her husband loved the first series that I sent (they never heard of REBUS before then), but her husband had a hard time understanding the Scottish accent (so do I at times).

As confirmed by this friend, this series does have English subtitles!",1497052800,,315,4.431034482758621
8533623,4,B00911MH14,"Good stuff. I'm glad someone said the shows don't jiive w the books. Basically they pick the title, the character names and one element of the plot--then go wild. I'm a Rebus junky and love the books/those stories. These stories are totally different but still enjoyable.

I enjoyed seeing the Rebus characters, they're well done. I'm delighted someone said story lines don't track w/ book, so that saved me being massively disappointed.",1496448000,,437,5.069444444444445
8533624,5,B00911MH14,"Brilliant, irreverent and charming when he wants to be, Ken Stott plays the Rebus roll perfectly... You don't know whether you want to shake him or hug him making it great fun to watch. The stories are well written and his partner Claire Price plays the steady, serious, counter to Rebus' unpredictability. Well done. And I love the Scottish accents.",1494806400,,350,4.85
