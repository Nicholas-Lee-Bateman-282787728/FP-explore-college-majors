7112919,5,B00VW70MGW,My girlfriend absolutely loves it. Does anyone know when part 2 is coming out?,1436832000,,78,4.642857142857143
7112920,2,B00VW70MGW,"If you bought the first season, you are getting the same quality. The quality is not consistent throughout the episode. Some shots look OK, while others look HORRIBLE! It looks like some kind of project that was done over the weekend with Windows Movie Maker. Overall, I give it a 2.5/5 because of the new dub.

I would recommend just to get the DVD version instead of the Blu-Ray - it is the same quality, just a downscale of the blu-ray upscale(most Blu-Ray/DVD players nowadays will automatically upscale the video to 1080p, so there isn't any difference in quality), and it would save you A LOT of money in the long run.

Here you can see full-size images of the Blu-Ray quality: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a. 929547180425253.1073741875.189705764409402&type=3",1436572800,19,776,5.25

7112923,5,B00VW70MGW,"I really enjoyed this season. It was cute and silly, but that's what Sailor Moon is all about. Keep that in mind. You won't get serious anime here, but that's okay.",1430438400,2,164,4.32258064516129
7112924,5,B00VW70MGW,"Great, but if they're going to have gaps between half season sets this long, it's going to take up to five YEARS to get the full series. I don't get why Viz have gone for half-seasons or why there's a five month gap between this one and the last one.

Here in Europe we've had full series releases in Italy and Germany (sadly, neither have English dubs, or I'd have bought them) - and they did full season sets and took just over a year to do all five!",1429833600,8,452,4.078651685393258
7112925,5,B00VW70MGW,"Sailor Moon R continues where the first season left off and is even more fun and action-packed than its predecessor. The appearance of two mysterious aliens prompts Luna and Artemis to resurrect the Sailor Team and restore their memories. In season two, the Guardians go up against monsters sent to drain human energy by aliens Ail and An, who unbeknownst to the girls, are actually the secret identities of the two new exchange students at their school! The 13-episode arc consists of An and Usagi competing for Mamoru's affection, the Sailor Guardians receiving upgraded versions of their regular attacks and Sailor Moon even earns a new brooch, transformation and weapon to fight evil. After defeating Ail and An, the Guardians get no time off, as the puzzling appearance of a short pink-haired girl claiming her name is Usagi Tsukino and demands the Silver Crystal keep them busy. Being called Chibiusa by the Guardians, she is also being targeted by forces from the Black Moon Clan, who are bent on killing her! The Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask work together to protect Chibiusa and keep her out of harm's way. This DVD is a great start to another fantastic season and I hope you all feel the same way after watching it!",1429401600,,1229,4.829383886255924

I decided not to get the BlueRay version and go with the regular DVD

Package is cute and simple which I love.

As a person who somewhat knows Japanese I will say sometimes the subtitles/English translations to me don't really sink up to what their saying in Japanese.

The big disappointment to me is I really wish the English Version was the one from the 90s. I'm assuming they weren't able to get the rights of something.",1480636800,,483,4.393258426966292

7112946,3,B00VW70MGW,"Love this series, its so dear to my heart, but really disappointed in the quality of picture on these blu rays... At the price these are they should be much better quality.  I feel as if I bought a bootleg 10 years ago.

 There is some kind of blurring filter that makes the line-art of the animation look smudged. There are also artifacts EVERYWHERE. Honestly I'm really unhappy with how this looks... I own blu ray of other series from this era that look great! Not sure what happened here...

I'm still grateful to Viz for rereleasing this wonderful series. But I wish they had given it more care... Still glad to own it for less than $150 a season. Hope they do a better job with the later seasons!",1473552000,,702,4.376923076923077

7112961,5,B00VW70MGW,"I am very happy with my Sailor Moon R part 1 Limited Edition box-set! After getting the limited edition Season 1 part 1 set & part 2 of season 1 I had to continue the series! I got SM R part 1 for a very good deal here on Amazon as well (especially for the LE version) I actually ended up paying LESS than I would've for the non limited version so that's awesome! (Thanks Amazon ^_^) The box-set was sent & packaged very safely so no harm could be done during shipping which I appreciate because I have had that happen before... The quality of the set is very nice as well! I love the hard (chipboard I believe?) box they used, it is very shiny & I like the artwork :) There is also space to store SM R part 2 & a 88 page exclusive booklet with character designs/info ect. I also had NO problems with video quality whatsoever & think this is a HUGE step up from the uncut grainy ADV sets that came out 10+ years ago. If you are on the fence about this & are a sailor moon fan then get it! You will not regret it trust me! Also if you want the limited edition set don't wait TOO long or they will sell out completely! I think the option to store part 2 of each season along with part 1 in a limited box is awesome! I cannot wait for sailor moon S (season 3) to come out!",1456272000,,1269,3.9416342412451364

7112970,4,B00VW70MGW,"I'm not sure if it was meant to be, but this show is extremely funny.  Usagi Tsukino is a teenage girl who possesses a magic brooch that allows her to transform into the superheroine Sailor Moon.  Along with her 4 fellow Sailor Guardians, they fight evil.  Usually evil is some monster of the week that has been conjured up by their true, behind the scenes, adversaries.  Sailor Moon is pretty much the biggest airhead of a heroine you will ever likely encounter.  Her superpower is to wave a baton around, yell something about Moon Princess, and the baton then emits some kind of kaleidoscopic effect which takes out the monster.  Before she got the baton, she used to throw her magic tiara at monsters, but she broke that thing somehow.  Sailor Moon is easily distracted in battle, by a dress on sale, by some hot guy nearby, by a shiny pebble on the sidewalk, whatever.  Her friends often have to yell at her to pay attention to the battle.

When she transforms, Usagi assumes various positions, pirouettes around, and basically acts like a swimsuit model posing or something.  Once she's done with all that stuff, she then launches into her monologue which consists of telling the monster ""I am the pretty Guardian who fights for love and justice"", then telling the monster how terrible it is for preying on people who only wanted to enjoy whatever event the monster appeared at, and finally ending with ""In the name of the Moon, I'll punish you!"".  By the time she finishes wasting time with all that prolog, the monster usually has her helpless in its tentacles (no, it's not THAT kind of show).

Sailor Moon's fellow guardians have some pretty formidable powers.  Sailor Mars and Jupiter control lightning and fire.  Sailor Venus appears to emit some kind of laser beam.  Sailor Mercury controls... well, bubbles.  The other 4 usually manage to at least get a shot off, but they are nearly always captured, incapacitated, knocked unconscious or otherwise defeated.  In an embarrassing slap in the face to girl power, they are almost always rescued by a masked man whose superpower is to throw a flower with a really sharp point on the stem.  That's right, the heroines who control fire, lightning, lasers, and, er, bubbles have to be rescued by a guy who tosses a flower.  Oh, the shame.",1447545600,3,2294,4.732997481108312

7112977,4,B00VW70MGW,"Honestly, people either aren't watching the Viz Blu-ray version of the show and trying to smear it so people won't buy it; or being super nit picky to the point they are becoming redundant.  The video quality itself is tons better then that of season one, and needs to stay this way or get even better in the later seasons.  I haven't seen any ghosting, or ""pixels"" as others have said, the only problems I've seen are blooming/blurriness (mostly on back grounds), and a few scenes would shake.  But, all in all, this is more or less what Viz said the show would look like when they announced it.",1445385600,3,596,4.4495412844036695
7112978,1,B00VW70MGW,I grew up watching Sailor Moon and I really don't like the English dub version of this one. It doesn't have the same sound track and I'm just not use to their voices and I also liked it better when she was Serena not Usagi,1445212800,5,222,3.9555555555555557
7112979,5,B00VW70MGW,"So, if you did watch the first 2 volumes, this should be familiar territory

If not, then I'll tell you without putting too many spoilers in.

After the events of the season 1 finale, the Sailor Guardians return to life as powerless teen girls. However, a new enemy calls them back into action. After the enemy is neutralized, a second enemy comes into play, trying to kill a little girl targeted for her search for the Silver Crystal.

I found this collection to have fitting voices and my preference for the use of the original Japanese terms and names.

I should be honest, because I like Naoko 's choice on the voices. She handpicked the actresses and actors for the 2nd English dub.

7112987,5,B00VW70MGW,"There are tons of reviews on the quality issues of the blu-ray version, so this is more of a review on what all you're getting.
I get the blu-ray version more to have it, and the limited edition-ness, than to actually watch it - I'll stick with watching the DVDs.
HOWEVER, the hard case you get the blu-ray in, which includes a 91 page booklet ALSO includes a space for part 2 for when it releases in October, which is awesome. I wish more things released in parts did that. The hard case the blu-rays sit in seems durable and is so PRETTY.
The booklet contains an episode guide, a who's who list, biographies on all major players and several pages of images.
Is it worth it? For the quality of the blu-ray, not really. But this is a limited edition version, with a booklet and a hard case which is, again, so pretty. If you've got the money to spare to upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, I'd say do it, otherwise the DVD quality is more than adequate, especially when compared to the blu-ray",1440892800,25,986,4.335135135135135

I haven't gotten through the first season yet and I have noticed some ""odd"" quality issues with the Blu-Ray versions (overdone color saturation, how some scenes are sharp & clear while others seem dull and fuzzy, etc.). I'm sure it's because of whatever method they used to convert the old animation into something ""almost"" HD quality like. Sometimes, you just can't upscale something from 4:3 into 16:9 perfectly.

I love the show and I was really happy to hear they would remaster the video and audio but Viz made a mess of it. there are pixels and out of the blue the contrast changes from light to darker depending on the surroundings, jumping screens and also there is a lot of blur.
I have even compared it with the older release of this show and the haziness is not in it.
If you don't believe me you can check it for yourself its most visible in episode 62 A Guardian's Friendship: Goodbye Ami

I am so very disappointing in how Viz handled the video of the show, someone at the company must really hate Sailor moon :(

I wish the Blu-ray case came with a sleeve like part 2 cause it kinda looks weird with 1 to have a sleeve and the other to not have one. Overall I am so happy to be able to own these. I can not wait for season 2 part 2 to come out and I can wait for all the other seasons to come out. What they did to remaster this is amazing. (And I should know I went to school for this).",1438560000,,669,3.6206896551724137
7112999,5,B00VW70MGW,"I don't understand what people are complaining about, if this company hadn't picked up the rights to make these DVDs, we wouldn't have the option to even get them anymore. Sure, I admit that things are different than the original dubbed version, but you have to expect that going into this. No one should be sitting there expecting perfect quality when this company has been extremely forthcoming saying that it's the same cartoon and format from the 1990's. They didn't redo the animation and if they had then this would not have been available for some time, nor would it be so affordable.

I'm extremely grateful to even have the opportunity to own this for purely nostalgic reasons. I was heartbroken when I tried to find the DVDs from the original series and they were $500 on eBay.

Stop being trolls and stop complaining, this works for what we want - to be able to watch Sailor Moon! I'm psyched that this works and I can watch it again.",1438560000,6,945,4.585798816568047
7113000,5,B00VW70MGW,It was amazing like the first season. I didn't bother with the special limited box this time because I $85 for one thing was a bit much for just a pretty box and booklet it in. The first season one was only $50 so having it getting pushed to $85 was like wow I can't believe it what are you thinking. So if you just wanting the DVD's this is a great deal the Bluray isn't really worth it in my opinion from what I have seen from other comparing them the images.,1438560000,,461,3.967741935483871

7113004,2,B00VW70MGW,"Ohh boy... Viz is all over the place in this release. Some scenes look great. Some scenes look okay. MANY scenes still look atrocious. This season on blu ray is marred with really pixelated transfer issues. In almost every scene there is really bad issues where lines are not straight because they are pixelated. Especially noticeable on the white lines on Sailor Moon's uniform. The DNR is still terrible. In the episode where Ami is going to Germany, the whole episode is aweful. You can literally see when the filter is ""turned on"" in the middle of a scene when the youma is attacking the senshi and it goes from non-blur to blur. The only real ""plus"" is the fact that the ghosting that heavily marred the first season is finally all but gone. Still a good presentation with menus and packaging. The dub again the real reason to support the release. Please Viz, get it together for S.",1437004800,21,887,4.584905660377358

7113007,4,B00VW70MGW,"Now, this release is good. The dub is very well done & well mixed. As noted by a reviewer on YouTube, the cast got more comfortable with their roles by this season. The dub is great.
As for the video, it's watchable, but not the greatest we could've gotten. Now, there are no ghosting issues to speak of like the ones that afflicted the season 1 sets. There are new problems, no I'm just kidding. The episodes are perfectly watchable in this form, but one thing I do have to bring up is the saturation. The episodes can look very saturated on the Blu-Ray. Not all the time, but some of the colors can look as such. There's also grain. It's not too noticeable unless you really look for it, but it is there, being from masters of an anime from the mid 90s. Trust me, though, it's still watchable. It's just not as good as the Italian, or Japanese DVDs.",1436832000,7,851,4.291925465838509
8711421,5,B00VW70MGW,"Season 2 picks up right after season 1, and has a lot of great character development, as well as various different bad guys. It gets into a lot of the backstory, and the fast paced story progression helps it feel like the series is even longer than it is!

As far as the physical release:
I had to purchase this from Amazon 2 times.
The first time, it came in bubble wrap as well as being in a box with my other items (they usually bubble wrap for Prime). I noticed the side of the outer box has a big tear all the way across it, and the spine of the booklet also had a scratch going completely down it. Later, I noticed that there were TWO Amazon labels on the item; one on the original plastic wrap, and the other on the bubble wrap. This says to me that the item was sold to someone with Prime, they returned it because of the sub-par condition, and then the seller offered it to me as a ""new item"". I've included pictures of both the tear, and the two barcodes.

I had to pay an extra two dollars to buy it the second time, but it was worth it, because that one looked great. The only minor issue is that the spine of the blu-ray case has tears down it, but it didn't affect the actual cover, so if I really want to, I can just move everything into an undamaged case (I had to do that when I got a broken Future Diary case in the mail). The plastic wrap on all of these I've bought so far looks cheap and repackaged almost, I think that's just how it is from the factory. I've included a picture of this, but I wouldn't at all say it's a reason to return a set. Most of them are going to have imperfections.

This box is a little less shimmery than Season 1, but still has the cute holographic details around the corners. It comes with DVD and Blu-Ray, and there is art on the inside over. The booklet is a very nice collector's edition, and I love the art they put in the back of the book, as well as the opening and closing song lyrics.

I haven't actually watched my discs yet, but I've watched the DVD quality on Hulu, and love what they've done to not only brighten and sharpen the art, but also gave us a more full screen image. My only worry is that the Blu-Ray might be over sharpened like the Sailor Moon R movie was. The voice acting choices Viz has made are PERFECT for all the characters, even if some of the original voices were also good. Luna is a huge improvement, and people need to stop being so nostalgic and picky. I'm so glad to fall back into my Sailor Moon obsession at a time where we can have the original, uncut script, as well as episodes that were not originally released in English.

Don't miss this collector's item. Viz did a great job at restoring the 1993 animation, rewriting and casting the English script, designing the perfect collector's set, and all at a very reasonable price. Even if the seasons are split into two parts, that's simply because there are so many episodes in the series. You're getting a full average season's worth of content for each part (each part of season 2 is 22 episodes), so even the original release prices aren't unreasonable. Even if you prefer the Japanese dialogue, there's no reason to not enjoy this release and the efforts that Viz went through to revive the Sailor Moon franchise.",1526688000,,3258,4.25686591276252
