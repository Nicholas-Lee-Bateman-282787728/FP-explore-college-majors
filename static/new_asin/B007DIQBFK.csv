All of the performances except, well, for the son ... are incredibly good. It's astonishing the garbage people give 5 stars to on Amazon and I am amazed this doesn't have a much higher rating. Very nuanced performances by the leads and a great, tragic ending.",1512086400,,411,4.35064935064935

8515045,2,B007DIQBFK,"I got this because I waned to see Elena Verdugo again. ( she played the gypsy girl in House of Frankenstein, 1944) But she only has a small part as the sons' wife. This was a fair film noir that was ruined by extremely poor picture and sound. Thus not recommended.",1424476800,4,264,4.196078431372549
