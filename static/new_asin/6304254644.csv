7865942,1,6304254644,"You know how some were irate that S. Coppola focused on the luxury in Marie Antoinette's life when most of France was starving and barely clothed?  This documentary wanted to focus on the luxuriant aspects of James' life too.  So they emphasize that he was born rich and that he travelled to Europe frequently.  If you like looking at American mansions and European historic architecture, then you'll find it here.

But James was a famed novelist and they spend about one minute on his books.  They don't even start discussing his career until two-thirds into the work.  If you are distracted for just one second, you wouldn't even know that he was an author.  Further, they try to portray James as just ""beinig shy with the ladies.""  Almost every other source says he was a rainbow flag man.  Rumor has it that he got busy with Oliver Wendell Holmes.  This work is mum on that important topic and can be read as being prejudiced or oppressive.

This work is so boring that no teacher would be foolish enough to show it to an American high school English class.  The documentary makers should truly be ashamed of this low-quality, despicable product.  This world is a worse-off place because of its existence.",1227657600,2,1209,4.7
