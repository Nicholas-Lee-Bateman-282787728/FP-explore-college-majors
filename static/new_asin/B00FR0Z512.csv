taken better pictures.  For a novice photographer it's soooooooooo much easier to understand and actually do.  I really
recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their camera skills.",1388534400,,299,5.061224489795919
8618068,5,B00FR0Z512,"Look, bottom line is that if something has a button, I'm going to have problems with it.  When I received my first digital camera recently, I figured ""here we go again!"".  A friend mentioned the ""Easy Photo Tips"" video and I tried it.  WOW!  Even I understood it!  The pictures included are incredible, by the way ... but more importantly, the instructions and tips are easy to understand and to put into practice.  I highly recommend this video to anybody who wants to get added value from their camera.",1387929600,,504,4.606741573033708
8618069,5,B00FR0Z512,"This was so valuable. High school photography class was a long time ago, this video brought back a lot of those early lessons plus several new tips that I've not considered. The video was short enough to watch in one sitting but there were a lot of tips packed into those 20 minutes. Seeing all the photographic examples for each tip, of the good and the bad, visually illustrated the advice in a way that made it even more accessible. I would definitely recommend this video to amateur or budding photographers, if you are yearbook advisor like me or just want to take better family vacation photos.",1387756800,,600,4.616822429906542

8618071,5,B00FR0Z512,"I found this DVD to be very helpful. I am not very skilled with using my digital camera. The DVD gave concise and simple instructions on how to improve the photos you take using any camera. The photographs used throughout the instructional video were beautiful and varied, and gave clear examples of the tips anyone can use to take better photographs of people, objects, or scenery.",1384905600,,382,4.803030303030303
