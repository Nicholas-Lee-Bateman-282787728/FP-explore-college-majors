4198753,3,B003UESJF6,"The start looks predictable: a super-hero in tights, a super-villain who never wins but keeps trying anyway. In short, it had all the makings of a nicely animated but bland bit of cookie-cutter entertainment. Well, I'm wrong a lot. One startling plot twist early on caroms this into a whole new direction.

Saying almost anything more would be a spoiler. (""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" and the rest aren't named for the bad guys - why this one?) The animation is good, the one-liners keep it light, and the voice actors seemed to have a blast. Maybe people won't be talking about this one ten years from now - no matter, it will give you plenty to chuckle about on the way home.

4198754,5,B003UESJF6,"Animation has gotten so very expressive . I saw this for the second time this evening (the first was theatrically) . It's awesome on Blu-ray with the subtitles on . I think this film will gain a very solid following on home video . Perhaps not . I really love it though . i feel all the various talents involved came together extremely well and had a totally unique take on  fairly weary (for me) super hero expectations . Lots of laughs , fun and quite singular .",1289001600,,464,4.2727272727272725
4198755,5,B003UESJF6,"Will Ferrell plays a genius supervillian named Megamind who ends up using his gifts for scandalous means after getting tired of being underappreciated and receiving the treatment of a social outcast. Brad Pitt plays his equally gifted rival Metro Man. Tina Fey plays a very energetic, vivacious, and upbeat woman named Roxanne that is very important to the character development of Megamind. The beautiful and uplifting message of the movie is that everyone has good in them. I also enjoy the message that seems to be tailored to both kids and adults that persistence can pay off even after multiple setbacks. There are plenty of scenes to make a person laugh. In addition, I like how the movie portrayed how a person that may seem like a villian on the outside is not always what they initially appear to be at the surface. In addition, the movie also sends a message that those that create mischief can many times be the ones that are yearning to be accepted and loved the most. All of the actors and actresses voiced their parts in a superb fashion. However, Will's Megamind character really helped to increase the humour and life into this great animated movie.  This is definitely one of the animated movies to see this month.",1288915200,45,1231,4.752336448598131

4199029,5,B003UESJF6,"The second-best analysis of the ""supervillain victory"" scenario ever filmed, just after the very different ""The Man Who Killed Batman"". The plot is incredibly strong, going places that seem obvious in retrospect but that I never saw coming in advance. It's not quite perfect - too many comedy scenes that aren't really funny - but it's sufficiently brilliant to make up for it. It isn't my favorite movie, but it is original, clever, and highly effective. And there's no movie where I can say, ""Megamind? Oh, that's just similar to the superior movie X."" There are movies I've enjoyed more, but there are none better than it at the specific thing it's doing.",1501977600,,658,4.831858407079646

4199454,5,B003UESJF6,"This is a movie I'd been wanting to see for a very long time, but never had the opportunity to until recently, and let me tell you: it was worth the wait.

The movie went in a lot of directions I wasn't expecting out of it (and that's a good thing in this case), and genuinely managed to surprise me with where the plot ACTUALLY went. It very much deconstructs the usual dynamic of this kind of 'superhero vs supervillain' setup, albeit while obviously parodying Superman in both Megamind and Metro Man's backstories (plus the latter's powers).

And naturally, being a Dreamworks movie, the CG is fantastic. Though Megamind often looks a bit... odd, it's undoubtedly intentional. And of course, Megamind's definitely right when discussing the difference between a 'villain', and a 'SUPERvillain'; his presentation is fantastic. When he arrives, he makes sure you KNOW IT.

Also, gratuitous use of very fitting rock music is always a plus. Megamind's got good taste.",1480982400,9,965,4.944444444444445

4199583,5,B003UESJF6,"This is a cute, animated, family video about Megamind, an alien sent from a dying world to Earth.  It sounds like the beginning of Superman, but the twist is that Megamind is a bit unlucky as he has a rival, Metro Man that arrives at exactly the same time.  In the opening scenes as Megamind's capsule is heading down towards the estate of a rich, childless family, Metro Man's capsule knocks Megamind's to the local jail while Metro Man ends up being adopted by the rich, loving family.

And, so goes the whole film.  Metro Man is certainly the more powerful, smarter, and more fortunate of the two, and Megamind becomes his main nemesis.  Megamind is a lovable criminal.  His actions are just naughty rather than malicious, and throughout the movie you get the feeling that he would choose to be the good guy if he could.

By the end of the movie, Megamind is given that opportunity ... and, I won't spoil it for you.

The critics panned this movie, but I liked it a lot.  Also, as a parent, it creates some space to have a fun, spirited, teaching moment with the littler watchers.

I highly recommend this movie.",1477785600,,1115,4.502487562189055

Once upon a time I owned every Disney VHS there was, and then, well, VHS was a thing of the past (can you imagine!!!?) and my final ability to play my beloved movies broke for the umpteenth time and I just couldn't justify fixing it again. I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Megamind (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a wonderful movie with a positive message that you will remember years down the road. But underneath it all, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

Amazon Digital is wonderful--it's nice to have this movie there in my forever library so I can watch it whenever and wherever I wish. The process was simple--press buy and viola! It showed up in my library.",1475366400,2,910,4.4431137724550895

4199672,1,B003UESJF6,"If you're easily mesmerized by flashy animation, clever psychological manipulation, cliched lines, and predictable plots, then MegaMind is your cup of tea.  Filled with an abundance of twisted morals and ethics, casuistry, and mantras such as ""end justifies the means"" and the same logic that drove the Inquisitions of the Dark Ages.  Some will only watch the surface tale.  The plot will look like a warped tale of insane and maniacal machinations to the moral.  To the immoral, it will look like a beautiful tale of redemption.  Therefore, I would predict that the reviews on this movie will be mixed as both the insanely immoral find the tale ""hopeful"", and the moral find the tale ""interesting"" at best.  I believe a far deeper tale is lurking below any of the surface plots that even the moral or immoral will not see.  This tale is one of which I will not divulge my thoughts at present, but suffice it to say that political posters for MegaMind look an awful lot like Obama's posters.  Many other comparisons to people in this tale to real life people and organizations could be made, and in telling them to you, many would not understand and others would be offended.  Needless to say, there is one who can transform himself into an angel of light (or in this tale, a hero of white) who craves the girl's affections.  The girl in this tale reminds me an awful lot of mankind who seems easily charmed by one who has 89 life sentences (reminds me of the naivety and stupidity of some girls today in being wooed by complete losers - this movie does nothing to help slow down such stupidity).  Pinky (or reddie - the red-headed superclown) and the Brain (MegaMind) seem to have a falling out in this tale as opposed to Spielberg's concept.  Seems that in the ""powers that be"", we see there's no longer a place for the former, but only for the latter.  Thus, this tale will be a bit more entertaining drivel to most, while some will be wise enough to see the spiritually deep and highly metaphorical ""tale behind the tale"" - a tale that appears to tell us the latest plans that we can expect to unfold soon.  Some with ""ears to hear"" will hear.  The masses will consider my words to be utterly senseless.",1474070400,,2207,4.5518987341772155

4199829,5,B003UESJF6,"This movie is currently the obsession of my 6 year old. Super action packed and with a more unique plot.

The basic premise is that two babies were sent to earth from planet destruction (like the origination story of Super Man). But, one of them is a big headed blue guy that starts out life in a men's prison instead of in a family. Naturally, he was not taught good things and became the world's super villain until the hero is no longer around. The world needs another hero. It shows that there is good in everyone and that good will always rise in the face of evil even from surprising places.",1471219200,,597,4.330357142857143
4199830,4,B003UESJF6,"When picking movies for our kids ages 3-10 to watch, we aim for something that is sweet, funny, and attempts to teach a valuable lesson about life. At first glance, you probably wouldn't think that Megamind would fit this bill, but it really does!

Megamind is a movie that teaches, amongst other things, that we get to choose the paths we take in this life. That it may seem that circumstances are against us or even that a path is laid out for us that we have to take, but the choice is still really ours! Couple that great message with some humor - even some adult humor - and funny characters and you have what turns out to be a sweet little movie.

I would definitely recommend this one!",1471046400,5,692,4.315384615384615

4199956,5,B003UESJF6,"I had seen this movie year ago, but I picked it up from A on Prime Day 2016. I watched it with my young daughter, who loves The Incredibles and similar stories. I enjoyed this move a lot. Mostly because I like the humor of the film and the really creative role-swap where the good guy dies early int eh film and the bad guy gets super-bored becuase he has complete control with no opposition.

I won't spoil any more of the film, but I really like the direction that these characters take. It has some of the wonderful super-gadgets that you find in the Dispicable Me films (yes, this was first), think dehydration ray, and explores some elements of super hero angst from an adult character's point of view like we see in the Incredibles. This review is just a rambling mess. . . watch this movie, you won't be disappointed unless you are very jaded and negative.

PS. Despite the statement in the movie made by the bad guy (good guy?) that there is no Tooth Fairy,. Easter Bunny, Santa Claus. . . I think this can be a great film to share with your children. I really like that hte characters are somewhat complex and not 100% good or evil. Introducing a gray area in a superhero film is a pretty modern thing to do.",1469059200,5,1217,4.333333333333333

The edges of my vision started to go black and I grabbed the arm of the person sitting next to me in the theater, but to no avail. Terror became my new reality as I realized that the world around me was oblivious to my imminent death, enthralled as they were by the jokes and the laughs. As my core muscles burned with the intensity of a thousand STDs and the remaining light at the center of my vision began to blur, I became keenly aware of just how insignificant and alone I am in this uncaring universe. The funniest joke of all was realizing, with perfect clarity, just how powerless God is to save me from oblivion.",1466726400,,764,4.275862068965517
4200083,5,B003UESJF6,"Most DreamWorks movies are nothing to brag about . Cheap stories, cheap humor, and cheap characters; too full of bathroom humor and sexual innuendos for kids, too lame for adults. Who the heck is their market??

That being said Megamind is proof that their are talented people in the deepest reigons of that studio and that when they get together good movies can co.a into existence.

The story is somewhat a spin off of Superman and other well known superheroes. Two advanced planets of a far off galaxy are about to be destroyed and a set of parents from each send out a pod carrying their child in hopes of saving them from this fate. One carries an adorable big headed baby with a blue complexion and the other a baby who seems to be Hitler's dream of ultimate human perfection. Both land on Earth and while the more human looking baby ends up in the home of a wealthy childless couple the blue one crashed into a prison and is raised by the inmates. Thus their destinies to be good (Metroman) and evil (Megamind) super foes is set.

Their battles begin during Childhood and unfortunately for Megamind try as he may he cannot beat Metroman. Then after years of failure, and 82 life sentences he discovers Metroman's secret weakness is copper and after using it to drain his power blasts him with a deathray. Finally free of his foe Megamind is now free to maraude to his heart's content and have whatever he desires only to discover that without a hero to oppose him it has all become incredibly...boring!

He decides to remedy the situation by recreating a hero to battle but when things go wrong finds himself in the akward position of realizing that he has created an evil even worse than himself and the only person who might possibly  be able to save his city from it is him. But after a life time of being the villian can he become a hero?

This movie is funny, not just the cheap slapstick funny but full of witty humor and fun Easter Eggs. The music is great, pop culture hits skillfully incorperated into the scenes to express the emotion . The characters real from Megamind's aquatic minion to his new found love interest the Lois Lane type reporter Roxanne Richy. The story engaging; you find yourself desiring to be a friend to the little blue outcast at the beginning, to tell off the vain Elvis Superman hybrid hero, to see Roxanne fall in love with Megamind without him having to keep his true identity disguised, and to see him rise up to become the hero you knew from the beginning he was meant to be. I cannot think of many movies that can entertain everyone from my mother to my youngest child but Megamind does.",1466726400,,2635,4.513626834381552

4200568,5,B003UESJF6,"In this Superhero Parody, Megamind (voiced by Will Farrell)
and his arch-enemy Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) are sent to
Earth as babies as their home planets face immediate doom.
Metro Man lands himself in the hands of a loving family that gives
him all the proper care one would want from the world.  Megamind,
on the other hand, lands in a prison and is raised by inmates.

You can kind of see where this is leading.  Metroman becomes
a super ""hero"" filled with goodness, while Megamind turns villain.
As much as the two hate each other, their relationship becomes
one of necessity.  For without one, the other has no purpose.
Aided by his trustworthy minion (voiced by David Cross), Megamind
launches a repeated cycle of failed kidnap attempts on female
reporter Roxie Richie (voiced by Tina Fey) to lure his opponent, until
one day, the plans actually work and finally rids the world of his
""goody-goody"" rival.

With no more conflict in his life, and wanting to impress the
female reporter that has become his object of affection, Megamind
hatches a plan to create a new nemesis by transforming a nerdy
red-headed cameraman (Jonah Hill) into an ber-SuperHero named
Titan.  When things go out of whack, Megamind must find a way
to set things right before the city is completely destroyed.

Megamind plays out like a comic-book caper that gives homage
to one of my favorite superhero movies (think Marlon Brando).
Filled with terrific one-liners, Megamind is a wickedly funny movie
that had me laughing throughout.  The action and humor seem
to come at a rapid pace, so the film never feels as if it runs out
of steam even when it becomes a bit heartfelt.  Helping the film
move along is the surprising inclusion of old-school rock featuring
the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC and ELO.

One really needs to see this transfer to appreciate it.  It's simply
impeccable. Though ""razor sharp"" is a term used quite often to
describe detail level, that term really comes into play here.  The
colors in the film seem to be on steroids.  It's very rare that I see
a powerful exhibition of eye-popping, vivid colors as I do here.  You
can thank Blu-ray for providing a presentation that looks as slick
as this one, and none of it gets suppressed when you put on the
3D eyewear.

So, let's talk about the quality of 3D here.  All of you should know
by now my personal preferences towards what makes a superior
3D presentation. I lean more towards ""In Yo' Face"" gimmickry over
something more subtle.  So, imagine the delight I had watching a
film that made exceptional use of the format it was conceptualized
for.  First of all, the film has a distinctive ""cardboard cutout"" look
to it.  Secondly, the filmmakers made great use of different sized
objects to enhance the 3D effect.  For instance, take a look at
Megamind floating in front of a JumboTron in one of the film's
earliest scenes.  The effect is simply amazing, making the character
appear as if he is floating just outside the perimeters of the home
theater display.  There is a similar sequence with a dangling spider,
who also seemingly hovers inches in front of the screen.  In the
meantime, we are treated to all kinds of objects that poke themselves
towards us including kernels of pop corn, laser guns, fingers and
an antenna above a skyrise building.  Even Megamind's flying
army of robots take their turn pointing their electronic eyes towards
the viewer.  None of the lunging affects are as dramatic as I would
have liked them to be, but nonetheless, at least someone is still
trying to make 3D movies that give the viewer their money's worth.

By the way, there was the most minor of ghosting issues present
in this transfer, noticeably at one point where Megamind points his
black-gloved finger towards the audience.  Other than that, I am
proud to say that this transfer is practically ghost-free.

The Blu-ray is presented with a 7.1 Dolby TrueHD track that is the
same as the theatrical Dolby Surround 7.1 mix.  You can read more
about the designing of that mix here. Suffice to say, this is a very
engrossing sonic experience with surround activity that is endlessly
engaged while never drowning out the front channels or center vocals.
There is a real sense of directionality when it comes to the placement
of the film's effects.  Most of the film's rock track comes through with
pounding clarity, such as George Thorogood's Bad To the Bone.  Other
songs like ELO's Mr. Blue Sky seem to be purposely placed in the
background so it gets more lost in the mix.  LFE activity is very
prominent as explosions and crumbling buildings managed to shake
the floor beneath my feet. This is a satisfying soundtrack that perfectly
envelopes the viewer as equally as the 3D presentation.

Megamind comes packaged as a Blu-ray combo with 3D and 2D
Blu-ray + DVD discs.  The Blu-ray contains the film's trailer.  The
DVD has added Special Features that include a featurette with the
voice cast; a deleted scene, filmmakers commentary and some
exciting scenes from past DreamWorks films that you can quickly access.

Megamind is the kind of film that's perfect for the entire family,
though I think it plays better for adults than kids.  From start to
finish, the film is just terrific fun and it has immense repeat value
as I would bet many of you will use this as a demo disc for your
3D display.",1453075200,,5368,4.714898177920686

4201087,5,B003UESJF6,"If you're looking for a good time and lots of laughs, I would suggest that you watch Megamind. This movie had all around laughs and took a different spin at superhero movies and gave us a great surprise that i know you would all enjoy. This movie is for all ages. I'm not going to go into a play by play detail of the movie. There are plenty of them out there. In my opinion, the movie was outstanding. It was so much better than what you would expect upon seeing the advertisements. So if you had planned on not seeing the movie because you just don't dig on ""kid movies"" I suggest you defenestrate those thoughts, and watch the movie, and judge it for yourself. It is fast-paced, plus, if you're a fan of excellent animation, Megamind is above the curve in that department. Such expressive facial features and body movements, little details that would be easy to forget or overlook, add so much richness to the experience. As for the storyline, it had a lot of panache. You sympathize and empathize with the animated characters. This movie has a phenomenal soundtrack. The music covers a range of music types from artists like Ozzy, AC/DC, Guns n' Roses, Michael Jackson, Elvis, ELO, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Minnie Riperton, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers. Plus, the original score is really good too.",1437264000,,1308,4.666666666666667

4201240,5,B003UESJF6,"I don't seem to be making it to the theaters as often as I once did.  So that's why I missed Megamind in theaters.  But I caught it on DVD this last weekend, and I absolutely loved it.

Our story starts on a distant planet that is about to be destroyed.  Two parents quickly send their infant son into space, hoping he will survive.  But he isn't alone.  Another baby from a nearby planet is also on his way to a new home.  The two land on Earth, where Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) lands in the home of a rich couple while Megamind (Will Ferrell) lands in a prison.

The two grow up and grow into arch nemeses, which Metro Man always winning their battles and reporter Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey) getting caught in the middle.

Stop me if you've heard this one before.

While the previews had looked promising, I figured it was a spoof on Superman.  There was certainly that element to the story early on, but things took an unexpected turn about a third of the way into the story.  To be honest, I really had no idea where they were going with things for a while, although I did guess the final parts early.  So, while I will say that there are predictable elements, I actually thought parts of this movie were pretty original.

Of course, even if it were predictable, I would have enjoyed the movie because it was so funny.  They manage to mock super heroes and villains pretty well in this film.  I watched it with a friend, and we were both dying at some of the jokes.  Even his wife, who isn't into super heroes as much, thought it was very funny.  Both Metro Man and Megamind are over the top as characters, which only adds to the humor of the piece.

Normally, I avoid Will Ferrell films because I just don't find him that funny.  This movie proves that, given the right material, he can be great.  I got over the fact that he was the main character in just a couple of minutes and sat back and enjoyed the film.  It helped that all the actors did a great job of creating new characters with their voices.  I usually find it very distracting when I recognize a voice in an animated film unless their character is very strong.  Here, not only were the characters strong, but the actors made their voices different enough that I never would have recognized them.

The animation is good, but it's nothing spectacular.  While Pixar always has a shot or two that catches my breath, this one didn't have any.  In fact, things were stylized.  Again, it wasn't distracting at all, but if you want something mega realistic or beautiful, you won't find it here.

What you will find is a funny movie that will make you laugh from start to finish.  If you've missed Megamind, correct that oversight today.",1431907200,,2702,4.378269617706238

4201741,5,B003UESJF6,"BAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I just LOVE this movie. I loved it when I was 11 and I'm loving it at fifteen. It's clever and funny in all the right places(But I have to say that it could be funnier.) I'm not normally a fan of superheros and villains type fare, but the plot here is very enjoyable.
What makes this movie shine, though, is all in the characters and their emotions. Megamind himself is TOO good. I just can't get enough of him. I mean, he makes the movie and that's probably why I've enjoyed it so much. He has this wicked aura of pure glee about him. Roxanne Ritchie,her nerdy cameraman Hal,the superhero of Metro City- ""Metro Man"" and last but definitely not least, his faithful Minion. They were all just so much fun. The emotions are beautifully expressed too- the eyes, facial expressions, everything. For a kiddie CG movie, you can REALLY get pulled into it.
The plot needs no repeating. But I did want to point out one thing. There's actually a really strong romantic subplot. It's cute and tugs at your heartstrings, but I was really, really not expecting it and it's what makes this movie-in my opinion- better reserved for slightly older kids. Like, maybe eight-nine-ten. Again, however, it did kind of make the movie for me because it's so obvious how Megamind is craaaazy about our kindhearted pretty reporter, Roxanne. Oh, and about Roxanne, you can tell that she's a smart, plucky female character. Unfortunately if you're looking for a strong female lead- and this is really not Roxanne's fault- she's constantly being kidnapped, rescued from death, falling from skyscrapers and being caught. It's honestly not her fault, and I loved her, but that's just a note.
Just let go of your preconceptions and enjoy it!! I know I did!!",1413504000,,1742,4.733552631578948

I like it so much I watched it like 3 times in 2 days. A lot of folks compare it to Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles, Don't bother, 2 completely different ways of story telling and stories.

Both movies are great, I just happen to like this one a tad Better.",1403827200,,378,4.236111111111111

4201980,5,B003UESJF6,"I admit I've never heard of this movie before. So when my brother (who looks just like Bernard actually) recommended I watch it, I was skeptical: a kid's cartoon about heroes and villains? Yeah, no thanks.

But I was off the mark. This is way more than just a ""kid's cartoon""; this movie explores themes and memes we take for granted in our movie culture, and asks some hard questions. The characters are also very well developed, especially Megamind himself: I can't remember the last time I actually got teary-eyed over an animated character. I adore Megamind the character and I adore the movie, too; I've watched it a couple times now and I love it more each time. Very highly recommended for both kids and adults (my eight-year-old nephew loves it too).",1403222400,,758,4.6992481203007515

4202120,5,B003UESJF6,"This is a surprising twist on the Superhero, Super Villain conflict. Megamind is a Super villain, who like his adversary came from another world, but there, the similarity ends, While Metro-man was thrust into the lap of luxury and gifted with every advantage growing up, Megamind grew up literally in a prison and was thrust into the shadows, reviled for being bad when he tried to do good, until he finally decided to give up and accept his role as a villain. At the center of this conflict is a newswoman Roxanne Richie who is currently enamored with Metro man, until one day, he loses a fight with Megamind, and all that remains is a cape draped skeleton. At first, Megamind is ecstatic and plans to rule with an iron hand, but soon grows bored as he longs for the battles he fought before. he begins a hidden Romance with Roxie disguised as Bernard the Metro man's museum attendant and he soon creates a serum that will grant a human with Metro Man's powers and by accident, Hal Stewart, Roxie's cameraman is injected, and Titan is created, but Hal is no hero and Megamind soon finds an adversary worse than anything he ever imagined, one that he isn't too sure that he can stop. He must help Roxie when she rejects Titan's advances and then team up with her to find some way to stop Titan's reign of terror. There are definitely funny parodies, one of Minion dressed like ""Robot Monster"", and Megamind's appearance as a Marlon Brando- ish Jor-el, Superman's real father pretending to be Titan's ""Space Dad"", but the main fun is the music that usually accompanies Megamind when he shows up for battle. And there are some pretty good tracks there.",1393632000,2,1651,4.619047619047619

It also shows how a tough upbringing and privileged upbringing set about the way society views us, how we view ourselves and the expectations we put on ourselves based on this.

Then the Blu-Ray was on sale on day so I bought it and the picture quality is cinematic. I love the film, and Blu-Ray is the best way tov watch it.

4202320,5,B003UESJF6,"As I stated before in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Croods/dp/B00FJTYDKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Croods</a>, Dreamworks' films have always been rather hit-or-miss for me.  While their animation has gotten considerably better over the years, easily on par with Pixar's output, many of their films lack the heart, soul, and charm of Pixar's classics, instead choosing to rely on celebrity voicework and pop-culture humor.  A few of their films in recent years have managed to break out of this mold and put story and characters above cheap gags (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-To-Train-Your-Dragon/dp/B0047C4KBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How To Train Your Dragon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rise-of-the-Guardians/dp/B00BBQXQFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rise of the Guardians</a>&nbsp;being the best examples), but for every one of these films it seems we have to suffer through another soulless ""Shrek"" or ""Madagascar"" sequel, or some other lackluster film.  At least we didn't get a ""Shark Tale"" sequel, I suppose...

""Megamind"" is a different sort of film -- it's still primarily a humorous film, with its share of pop-culture-ish jokes (though mostly drawn from comic books rather than more current media).  But it also has a heart behind its story, and characters that are both well-developed and able to take the classic superhero tropes and stereotypes and turn them on their heads.  And of course, its a LOT of fun.

The titular Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell in a surprisingly clean-mouthed role) is an over-the-top supervillain who delights in his wicked ways, waging war on his lifelong rival Metroman (voiced by Brad Pitt) with the help of his trusty companion Minion (voiced by David Cross).  In a shocking twist, one of his villainous schemes actually works and leaves the city without its hero, and for a time he revels in his victory.  But he soon grows bored, wanting the challenge that constantly fighting a hero provided, and so creates a new superhero named Titan (voiced by Jonah Hill) to pick up where Metroman left off.  But when Titan goes out of control and proves to be even more a villain than even Megamind could hope to be, it falls on Megamind and a sassy TV reporter (voiced by Tina Fey) to set things right.  Will a villain turn out to be the hero a beleaguered city needs?

As always, the animation in this film is top-notch.  The look of the film is sleek and stylish, with the sort of over-the-top feeling of classic comic books.  The human characters have their own unique style, without looking like living dolls or ultra-realistic.  When a CGI film tries to make its human characters look photo-realistic, they usually fall just a bit short, resulting in the characters looking creepy or zombie-like (I'm looking at you, ""Polar Express""...).  Some of Dreamworks' earlier films fell into this trap, but ""Megamind"" keeps a stylish design that avoids the ""uncanny valley"" effect.

The characters are what make this film really shine, though.  Megamind isn't just a one-dimensional ""villain,"" but a socially awkward being who decides that if he can't fit in, then he'll simply stand out in his own way.  His performance is campy and over-the-top, but purposefully so, reveling in spiky leather costumes and elaborate gadgetry and classic-rock anthems at every appearance.  And ironically, he has a stronger sense of good and evil than many other characters in the film, and provides some of the most heartfelt scenes in the film.  Metroman is comparatively bland, but given that he's pretty much Superman in a different costume that's to be expected, and he does show some surprising depth to his role later on in the film.  Roxanne, the reporter, is a spirited character who provides some delightfully snarky humor throughout the film, while Titan starts off dorky but turns out to be surprisingly creepy and effective as time goes on.

This film hits a good balance between Dreamworks' usual humor-driven fare and Pixar's heartfelt storytelling, turning classic superhero tropes on their heads and exploring what makes a villain and what makes a hero.  It's fun, pleasant to look at, and has strong voice acting that never jars the viewer out of the story with a ""hey, isn't that so-and-so?"" moment.  And while I still consider ""How To Train Your Dragon"" and ""Rise of the Guardians"" to be Dreamworks' best films, ""Megamind"" is a close third.  Probably best for kids 8 and up due to action violence and some scary scenes.",1383004800,,4629,5.403337969401947

4202386,4,B003UESJF6,"The underlying message in this movie is definitely nothing less than negative.
It just tells the kids that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to give the morally bad a chance to rule the world.
Full of occult symbolism and hidden messages.

4202423,4,B003UESJF6,"This is easily one of Dreamworks' funniest movies; Will Ferrell and Jonah Hill's personalities shine through in their voice acting and the story is well executed if not slightly cliche at times (probably intentionally).  But in my opinion, the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version leaves something to be desired.  I watched it back-to-back with a Pixar movie and the Pixar movie was undeniably better in terms of resolution (yes, full 1080p with HDMI on both).  There were times I was squinting, trying to figure out whether I was watching the DVD or the Blu-Ray disc.  At times, scenes with a lot of detail or repeating patterns, appeared pixelated.  But it's still the best looking version of the movie you can buy currently buy.  Great movie, just not the best Blu-Ray I've ever seen.",1374105600,,789,4.850746268656716

4202442,5,B003UESJF6,"I am VERY particular about what my children see - I have a 7 year old girl and 9 year old boy.  I don't like movies with violence or references to death and destruction.  To give more detail on this, I should say that I am very sorry I allowed my kiddos to see the Cars 2 movie, and the Ben 10 Alien shows, Monsters vs. Aliens tv program (namely the episode about zombie carrots or pumpkins - something orange and zombielike) and even Ninjago is not on my list of preferred shows.

I had not allowed my kiddos to watch this movie because I was under the assumption that it ranked right up there with these other shows and movies that introduce unnecessary violence and references to boogie monsters and zombies.

I finally gave-in to the requests from my kiddos and watched this movie along with them.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually had a good story, and the violence was minimal - no zombies or boogie monsters - woohoo!
Some of the references to the budding romance between Megamind and the reporter went wooshing over my children's heads - that's probably a good thing.  :)

We will probably end up adding this to our collection of movies.",1371772800,,1153,4.483253588516747

Will Ferrell is funny as always but I don't think I laughed out loud more than once the entire movie.  3D-wise, also not the best - of course, I had just watched Madagascar 3 right before this which is the king of 3D cartoons so that didn't help.

4202554,5,B003UESJF6,"If you're on the I-net you can almost find out everything you want to know about a movie. And I think the only people buying this DVD are folks who already love the film. But if you at least want an opinion, I'll tell you what I thought:

I found this movie charming, sweet, funny, and not scary (like some kids' animated films can be) unless someone gets freaked out by the one scene with the skull on the floor.  But even that was silly.

Megamind became evil because he was always sort of rejected at school.  And everything he did to try and help or be a good guy always went badly.  He finally decided that the only thing he was good at was being bad.  But, apparently, he was not too great at that either since he always lost in the end.  His... er... unique sidekick, Minion (a fish in a bowl connected to a giant robot gorilla body) is as lovable as poor Megamind.

I am writing this review to try and be helpful, but I've found that everyone's taste in movies is like their taste in food: What one person absolutely loves, another may find impossible to swallow.  By no means is Megamind hard to swallow (although I did find myself ""choking"" on the movie, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs), and I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie, but you just never know.

If anyone remembers the Disney film, The Little Mermaid, you must remember Ursula the Witch. Remember how scary she was? I had brought my 3-year-old to see a happy little movie and was incredibly surprised that they put such a scary image in an otherwise delightful and harmless movie. You won't get surprised like that by this film. However, if your child might be freaked out by little flying robots with steel chompers (Megamind's pets) just be warned. They only appear for a few seconds 2 or 3 times in the movie.",1364342400,,1795,4.395770392749244

4202567,5,B003UESJF6,"I first saw this movie with average expectations thinking it was just another kids movie. When I left the theater, I was very happy. MEGAMIND has a great original story! The idea in that the villain wants to be something more than being a bad guy and the hero who is tired of being a hero.

When the movie came on TV recently, I saw it again and still makes me laugh.

Great story, plenty of humor, fantastic voice overs, sound, and music.

Funny thing is the DVD is hard to find in stores. Where I live Target and Bestbuy don't carry the DVD. Blu-Ray is available everywhere. But here on Amazon.com, I can purchase the DVD.

4202690,5,B003UESJF6,"...because one thing that is never really mentioned about this movie is the huge middle finger it gives to ""Nice Guys"". It's no wonder that kids don't often respond well to this movie when the biggest problems in it are more ""real"" and adult than one would expect. This movie was packaged as a silly kids movie targeted to little boys but instead attracts tons of adult women. This is one of the few ""kids"" movies that portrays the female character as someone who can hold her own (she's not at all afraid of the villain Megamind, is bored and unimpressed by the hero Metro Man, is anything but a damsel in distress, and often contributing to the plot rather than being in the background... like most female characters are). The romance in this movie is never advertised and I feel that it's extremely important to mention, and advertise... Megamind likes her! But Megamind is also evil, unsocialized, and self-centered. Do the math. But Megamind isn't the ""Nice Guy"" I mentioned before. You'll see. But I feel it's important to bring this up, since we live in a society where kids are taught that ""boys will be boys"" to girls... which I shouldn't get into any further within a review of a kids movie for obvious reasons. So this movie wins for not only a respectable and contributing female character, but also the subtle example of how ""Nice Guy"" behavior can go way too far. Kids most likely won't understand this movie too well until they're older, but that doesn't mean they won't enjoy it. If you are a parent, make sure you talk with them afterwards about this movie. I'm serious. Ask them why the villain shouldn't behave as he does with Roxanne, explain to them that people are not possessions, or prizes, and that women deserve the same respect as men. Explain to them that Megamind's villainy is a cartoon, and should never be repeated in reality. Explain to them Megamind's main theme of making up for your mistakes, as well as never giving up. This is a Dreamworks movie with a lot of hidden potential for discussion-- maybe watch it once before watching it with your kid, because it could be a good learning tool! But all of this serious talk aside, don't worry-- this movie is hilarious, touching, and you'll fall in love with Megamind within the first ten minutes. I promise. This movie is worth a look! And no, this movie is nothing like Despicable Me. I wish people would stop comparing the two.",1357603200,,2413,4.627039627039627

Superman can be compared to this MetroMan in this movie. The movie starts out with Megamind being mistreated by everyone else and it leading him to become the bad guy. He eventually ""wins"" as the bad guy, but then has to become the good guy. It is a very fun movie, full of creative jokes and humor. I recomend this for everyone!!

4202765,5,B003UESJF6,Megamind is a funny campy cartoon superhero/antisuperhero movie. Our sons love watching it over and over again. Some adult story lines that the kids do not pick up on,1354147200,,166,4.758620689655173
4202766,5,B003UESJF6,"The jokes and high energy in the entertaining ""Megamind"" come out of a cute conceit: what if every type of boilerplate character you've ever seen in every superhero story all of a sudden questions his or her motivations and role in life?  So here we have a super villain who starts wondering why he's a villain, a villain's henchman wondering why he's content to be a henchman, characters who are supposed to be heroic who decide they just want to slack off for a while or (in a third act tour-de-force) even be villainous.

And, oh yes, there's also a cute Lois Lane-type who questions why she always has to be the one being rescued and pined over by the guys in capes.

Peppered throughout all this are lots of affectionate pokes at every remaining convention of the superhero genre that the characters I just mentioned weren't already addressing.  Imaginative character designs, good action, and a decent little story round things out.

In the end, ""Megamind"" is sort of like Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" (which I also liked a lot), only tighter and funnier.  It's worth seeking out on disc or via your favorite streaming, download, or cable service.",1354060800,,1150,4.782828282828283

I'm not sure who the writers wrote this movie for - kids, or 25 to 40 year-old females like me.  This darn movie never gets old.  It's a love story at its heart, so women my age (particulary those who have extra interests in the superhero genre) will love it.

A good twist on the usual evil versus good movies where the Villain wins and then is lost without his nemesis to pit his wits against.  It is also a good moral of how even someone who has been created pure and good can turn evil.  The 3D effects are better than some other animated movies I have watched recently like Brave.  Not much else to say about it, other than it is offers nothing new from every other similar animated movie but it does entertain for 90 minutes",1353196800,,525,4.117647058823529

4202811,4,B003UESJF6,"Megamind has been called a cheap imitation due to its similarities to The Incredibles and Despicable Me. I don't think that's fair. First and foremost, it isn't very similar to Despicable Me at all, unless you want to say every single story told from a villain's perspective is also an imitation. If not, then that's where Megamind and Despicable Me's likeness end. Megamind is not a cheap DreamWorks version of The Incredibles either, because while The Incredibles is a serious homage to superheroes, Megamind is a light-hearted, satirical look at the life of a supervillain. Completely oppposite sides of the spectrum. Family-focused drama is at the base of The Incredibles, comedy is at Megamind's. The cast is quite funny, and very entertaining on their own. Just listening to the tones in the characters voices can be a good time. Add in the various facial expressions and bodily mannerisms, and the characters feel very real. Sure Brad Pitt could have had a bigger role, but his absence didn't bother me much, because Will Ferrell more than carried the film on his own.

Despite the occasional stupid joke, like the mispronunciation of simple words and such, Megamind has its moments for both adults and children. And along with the humor, there are some soft spots as well. Honestly, they may not phase older audiences much, because the comedic aspect is so overpowering that it can be hard to feel other emotions, but nevertheless, the drama is there. Unfortunately, Megamind never really rises above being just another fun animated movie. It favors younger children more than adults, but it would be stupid to call that a flaw. That's not to say it won't resonate with older audiences though. Granted I'll probably pull The Incredibles off of my shelf if I'm in the mood for an animated superhero/villain flick, but I can still see myslef returning to Megamind in coming years. The script could have been a bit more inspired, but the animation is top notch. Textures were spot on. Leather and fabric, dust and smoke, fire and water, fur and hair, etc. They all looked real and natural. Everything was overly detailed to the point of being a distraction at times (in a god way). With that being sai, it's not another Shrek or How To Train Your Dragon, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to Pixar's work, but it's stil good enough to recommend.

MegaMind, however, is a role that HAD to be overacted, and Ferrell comes through with a perfect performance that provokes a wide range of emotions in the viewer.

The rest of the voice talent is also well performed. Tina Fey is great as the ""Lois Lane"" role reporter, and Brad Pitt performs solidly in his rather brief role as MetroMan.

The entire movie is, of course, a Superman parody, right down to a facsimile of Brando as Superman's father, as MegaMind is trying to groom his ""new hero"". However, in this superhero plot line, the evil villain eventually wins, then suffers through the reality that without the hero to contend against, there's no fun left in his life. Things go wrong when he tries to create a new superhero to fight, and suddenly he experiences a rather strong need for a role reversal.

The movie is highly amusing and very touching at times. As animated parodies of this type must to succeed, it does a great job of touching on familiar themes and scenes from comic books ... very similar the the success achieved by ""The Incredibles"", which has long been among my personal favorites of the ""later day animated films"".

I have a few other 3D movies on Blu-ray (including Hugo) at this point and this one doesn't disappoint in the least.

So I wasn't thrilled at the idea of seeing this film. But I did, and I liked it.
The story is about a supervillain, Megamind, and his attempts to outwit heroes and take over Metro City. But what happens if he were to actually win?
The previews for the film were deceiving in the sense that you thought you knew what the story was going to be about and you thought it was just another predictable superhero film. Not so. The storyline showcased in the previews took place for the first ten minutes of the film and then everything moved on. The rest of the film was full of twists and turns and you won't know what to expect next. The storyline was fun and unique, the characters were engaging, and the development of story and characters was believable.
On the other hand, the comic wit of the film was not fully there for me. There were some very funny moments and gags, but also some very lacking comedy as well. But... not enough to take away much from the film.

4202895,4,B003UESJF6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Despite its rather conventional ending, 'Megamind' proves to be a highly entertaining twist on the superhero genre. Satirizing the origin of the Superman comics stories, we're introduced to two different superheros, Megamind and Metroman, as they arrive on earth from separate dying planets, in space capsules at the same time. Metroman's  is smooth but Megamind's is anything but--crashing into various meteors and debris like an out of control bumper car. A flashback chronicles how Metroman ends up with an all-American family but Megamind plops down in middle of the Metro City prison where he's raised by inmates to be a 'villain'. But Megamind is actually more like The Wizard of Oz than a hardened criminal--his dark side can best be described as a mischievous youthful offender, capable of rehabilitation.

  If Megamind's delinquent mindset is his Achilles heel, Metroman is also trapped by his celebrity status. An Adonis with a chiseled jaw, Metroman flings babies in the air with aplomb as police officer shoot their guns as part of a blind celebratory approbation. Megamind and Metroman periodically battle one another for the affection of love object Roxanne (Roxie) Ritchie, a perky TV newscaster voiced by the talented Tina Fey. Roxie isn't impressed by their clumsy attempts to win her affections. She's bored after being kidnapped by Megamind and after being brought to his lair bluntly tells Megamind that your ""plan never works"". When Metroman arrives and engages Megamind in yet another physical confrontation that always ends in a stalemate, Roxie wittily queries: ""Girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?""

  'Megamind' breaks into its second act when Metroman fakes his own death and the blue-skinned Conehead finds himself experiencing an 'existential crisis'. Without Metroman, Megamind laments, ""it's just too easy now"". In his 'despair', Megamind's delinquency in Metro City (or 'Metrocity' as he puts it) multiplies exponentially. Megamind steals all the artwork in the city's museums and places them inside his own office inside City Hall. He throws currency all over the streets as if it's confetti, but none of the mischief makes him happy. Finally, using an idea he appropriates from Roxie, he decides to create his own superhero so he can once again find some meaning in his existence. NY Times critic Stephen Holden puts it most succinctly: ""The movie's central joke -- that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition -- is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie.""

  Megamind's new opponent turns out to be Roxie's cameraman, Hal, a geek who expects women to flock to him without mustering any effort to charm them. Before being injected with Megamind's new preparation that alters his DNA, Hal is a harmless nerd who reminds me of a caricature of Bill Murray's cameraman in the classic comedy, 'Groundhog Day'.

  There are tons of funny moments in 'Megamind'. Here a few that come to mind: when Megamind tells Roxie they're making renovations at the Metroman Museum (""we're having the walls and ceilings removed""); when Megamind throws the dynamite at his mini-bots and apologizes (""Daddy's sorry""); Minion's expression when he leaves Megamind (stifling his tears and then displaying a stiff upper lip); Titan's lame comment after Roxie rejects him (""Wow, our first fight""); the reaction of the man with the baby in the restaurant when Bernard is transformed back to Megamind (his eyes are wide open in disbelief!).

  Despite all the good stuff, 'Megamind' loses its way when introducing 'Titan', a character that diminishes the comic tone of the film's second half. Although Megamind was always up to mischief , he never had murderous intentions (remember how surprised he was, when he thought he had killed Metroman). Before Megamind's misguided intervention, Hal was like many other geeky guys who simply hadn't discovered the right way to charm women. Remember it was Roxanne herself who confronted Titan and reminded him that he was not such a bad guy after all, BEFORE he was transformed. This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: ""I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal."" In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been ""self-absorbed"" and perhaps a little ""selfish"", but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his ""issues"" just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters.

  Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore.

  In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath. Perhaps he encountered some Kryptonite type substance that made him act that way or perhaps Minion used the wrong DNA when the formula was being prepared. Some may believe on the other hand that Hal was innately bad and Titan merely represented a magnification of his evil nature. Whatever the case, the Titan character was so unlikeable that the film's denouement turned into the standard comic book 'good triumphs over evil' narrative.

  Why belabor Megamind's obvious shortcomings? There's enough excellent, clever stuff here to keep the critical film goer eminently satisfied. 'Megamind' is without a doubt, worth more than just one viewing. Check it out!",1322870400,,6001,5.0588235294117645

I have probably seen all the animated movies of the last decade and a half (side effect of having 4 kids). Some I liked, a few I really liked, but majority of them were just nor very good.
I was out with a friend, the movie selection was poor, by default we settled on this one (me, very half-heartedly, not wanting to watch ANOTHER animated movie, especially when I didn't have to).
The story line is so creative and smart, the characters are very well developed and so loveable with all their strengths and short-comings. The movie is outrageously funny while being genuinely innocent (funny thing to say about a movie of EVIL). I can't tell you how many times I teared up from laughing so hard. I instantly fell in love with this movie. The rest of the night I couldn't stop talking about Megamind, the catch phrases, the jokes. I couldn't wait to share it with the kids. Megamind fan forever.",1322524800,,1060,4.4974093264248705

There are about 173 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 22 made it to 15%, 19 out to 20%, 36 more at 25% and 2, 30-35%. That's a lot of OOS effects. In addition there are quite a few quick 25-40% effects piled near the title scenes but the 3D in them is a somewhat flawed. However, very few 3D flaws elsewhere in this film. I would have to say my favorite effect is the baby juggling / drooling sequence around 30% approximately 10 minutes into the film.

This movie earned a 4 way tie for the # 2 position on my shelf. For 3D quality and humor, it ranks right up there with the 3 other animated greats, Open Season, Rio and Ice Age.

4202898,3,B003UESJF6,"***1/2

The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around.  His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces ""metrocity"").  When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent.  Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA.  But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.

Though ""Megamind, "" directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults.  Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration.  It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles.  And the script by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons contains an interesting subtext about the rewards and sacrifices that come with being both a hero and a villain, a subtext that brings an added dimension to the movie.",1322352000,,1900,5.006349206349206

4202921,4,B003UESJF6,"`Megamind' doesn't feel like something new, in fact it feels like something I've seen a few times already, but that doesn't take away from the comic nature of the beast and the fact that, at its heart, it is still a pretty memorable film.  Enlisting big names in comedy like Will Ferrell and Tina Fey along with newcomer Jonah Hill (who is easily the funniest character in the film) and superstar Brad Pitt was a smart move, especially since their voices lend themselves well to voice over work (you may think it's easy to `voice a cartoon', but you really have to have the right voice for it).

The film tells the story of two young orphans, both aliens who are transported to Earth when their home planets are being destroyed.  Young Megamind and Metro Man have an instant rivalry considering that their fates were so very different.  Pegged as the loser, the outcast, the shamed one since he was ten days old, Megamind began to resent others and soon he embraced the only thing he was good at, being bad.  Metro Man, on the other hand, became swallowed up in his own ego, having others fawn all over his heroic acts and soon he became a hero, a legend in his own time.  The citizens of Metro City watched with baited breath as Metro Man consistently defeated Megamind, until...

Metro Man was killed.

After finally getting his wish and defeating Metro Man, Megamind realizes that his evil ways are pointless if he doesn't have someone to battle.  It was too easy being bad when there was no good to counteract it, and so he devises a plan to replace Metro Man.

It backfires.

In the process, Megamind learns a slew of life lessons we could have seen coming a mile away (maybe ten miles at that) and the eventual outcome is rather easy to predict (the bad guy NEVER gets the girl...unless you're watching a kid's movie where the bad guy isn't really that `bad') but there is still a lot of fun to be had here.  The laughs come rather fluidly and the repartee between the characters is fun to watch.  Brad Pitt sounds like a here, Will Ferrell sounds like a dimwitted villain and Jonah Hill is just, well, hilarious.  It looks sharp and it delivers thrills, but never in a way that would startle or scare a kid.  This is a battle between good and evil that you don't need to be scared to show the youngsters.",1317945600,2,2311,4.4560570071258905

4202951,4,B003UESJF6,"What fun! Megamind is fine for children, but there's plenty in it for adults, too. Here's the plot: Megamind (whose head is unnaturally large and whose skin is a bright shade of blue) and Metro Man (who looks deceivingly human) are sent to Earth from dying planets when they are just babies. Metro Man (voiced by Pitt) has the good fortune to land in a mansion, where he's adopted by a wealthy family. Megamind (voiced by Ferrell) lands in the yard of a prison.

As the two grow up, they find themselves at odds. Metro Man is always receiving praise and saving people. Megamind, unfortunately, undertakes several science experiments that go wrong, bringing scolding and punishment from the same teachers that dote on lucky Metro Man. In exasperation, Megamind finally decides being bad is the only thing he's good at, so he chooses a life of crime.

For the next decade or so, the two aliens battle it out against the backdrop of Metro City, their epic struggle covered in detail by local news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Fey). In a fluke plan, Megamind apparently kills poor Metro Man. Suddenly, the outcast has achieved his dream - a city he can rule with impunity. But all the stolen loot and fancy paintings in the world don't satisfy him now that his archenemy is gone. Purposeless, Megamind finally has to come to terms with who he is and what he really wants in life.

I knew where the movie was going to end, but I just wasn't sure how they were going to get there. Will Ferrel's usual over the top performance fit really well with the Megamind character to make a hilariously fun bad guy.
For kids, I think this movie has a lot to offer, especially for those who like superheroes. This is a movie that is told from the bad guy's point of view and that's something that kids don't always get to see. They'll easily relate to the poor little blue boy in school. They'll like the tough guy rock music soundtrack too. At first, I thought it was bit too much, but really it's just fun music. Overall, a very good movie.

The actors portray the characters perfectly, I do not believe they could have done a better job with casting.  There is a lot of emotion in the movie and it causes the simple plot to be more complex.

When a young alien is shipped to earth by his parents, he has only the people around him to learn from.  While being raised in a prison, this isn't ideal.  While on the other hand, Metro Man lives a life of perfection; He has parents that love him, friends that adore him and adults who dote on him.  Megamind, knowing only bad and rejection, decides as a child he will be an evil villain.  When grown, Megamind has an evil plan to rid the world of Metro man.  By kidnapping Roxanne Richins, the supposed girlfriend of Metro man, his plan seems to be going well.  Metro man, attempting to save Roxanne Richins, fails miserably resulting in his death.
With the world at his fingertips and all of Metrocity under his control, Megamind thinks he has it all.  Until, he realizes he has no purpose without a hero.  What will he do?  So in true villain spirit, Megamind decides to create a new superhero.  While working hard on this project, Megamind has time on the side to woo Roxanne Richins in disguise.
When everything is said and done, what will Megamind choose?  Villainy or love?

When Metroman disappears, apparently destroyed by Megamind, the big blue head has trouble adjusting.  When he starts falling for the girl, things really get interesting.  The puns and parodies, like Megamind's constantly mispronouncing words, always getting it wrong, was fun but a bit overdone.

Megamind also wants to make a hero so he can battle him and get back some of the good old days.  Unfortunately this backfires, with the former nerdy cameraman becoming Titan (or as he spells it, ""Tighten"") the new super villain.

How will Megamind adjust to being a super hero?  He's not supposed to win or get the girl.  What is up with that?  And having a Marlon Brando knock-off was frankly hilarious.

Themes:

I really liked the theme of becoming more than you really are and being willing to make big changes in your life.  Megamind had a lot of hard choices to make.  And Roxie, the girl from Channel 8 (a clear homage to Lois Lane from the Superman comics) realizes she's been judging a book by its cover rather than seeing what lies behind it.

DVD:

I really liked the ""making of"" segment with Wil Ferrell, Tina Fey and others talking about the film and how much fun they had making it.  There are also the usual previews and advertisements on the DVD as well.  Listen to another rendition of ""Move It"" from Madagascar!

Bottom Line:  Quite enjoyable homage, almost a parody in some scenes, and I think will be enjoyable, especially to comic book fans or those familiar with Superman's origins.  The movie does run out of gas in the second third of the film.  I felt the producers spent too much time on Megamind's depression rather than having some more action.

Overall, recommended!",1310256000,,2080,4.740223463687151

4202992,3,B003UESJF6,"There's nothing at all wrong with MEGAMIND, but there's not as much right with it as there could have been. For a while, it flirts with being a demented remake of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie -- or maybe just appropriates a few ideas from that film in the way all animated movies now shamelessly pander to the assumed tastes of the parents of the rugrats watching it [1] -- but it always settles back into the groove of Kid-Approved Plot #4: Misunderstood Loner Makes Good.

Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell, sounding like he's actually playing a character rather than doing the Will Ferrell thing, and that's good) has the funny version of Superman's origin: rocketed to Earth from a doomed planet, but landed in a prison. His nemesis, Metroman (voice of Brad Pitt, and in the movie much less than you'd expect from the ads), has the good-guy version of that origin, and so they fight, starting when they both go to the same little red schoolhouse as tots. The Lois Lane figure is Roxanne Ritchie (voice of Tina Fey, not really sounding like herself, either), who's feisty enough that you almost don't notice that her entire role in the movie is to be the girl that strong men will fight over.

The bulk of the movie, though, takes place after the Megamind-Metroman conflict has been permanently resolved, leaving Megamind at loose ends. And, since this is a movie for kids, his devotion to evil is purely based in liking to wear capes with dark colors and an appreciation for the stoner anthems of my childhood. To be blunt, he's not actually evil in any sense, and his nefarious schemes were all entirely devoted to killing Metroman -- not to stealing anything, or conquering the world, or any more traditionally evil doings.

And we all know that the ending has to have Megamind turning into a good guy and saving everyone, right? Even supposedly edgy and goofy animated movies these days have to be massively renormative in the end, and MEGAMIND is no exception; everything turns out as nice as nice can be. It is pretty funny along the way, though -- even Megamind's random mispronunciations, which I was expecting to become horrible very quickly, stay few and funny, and even become an important plot point -- which is about what should be expected from a movie like this.

[1] This movie has one particularly egregious example: all of the music in it is at least twenty years old, the songs we parents remember from our own youths.",1306713600,,2452,4.695348837209302

The Film 4/5

Hollywood has made more than its fair share of superhero movies since Superman (1978) was released, but the genre remains one of the most popular. Viewers, especially in North America, enjoy recapturing childhood memories and seeing their heroes on the big screen. Most of the plots are predictable, but that doesn't detract from the fun.

Megamind deviates from the traditional plot in the same way that Despicable Me did. We are asked to sympathize with the villain.

The movie begins with Megamind (Ferrell) leaving his parents in a ship when his planet is on the verge of destruction. Does that sound familiar? References are made to Superman throughout the film. While this is happening, a child is sent to safety from another world close to destruction. The two children fall to Earth and experience very different childhoods. Megamind lands in a prison yard, while the other child falls to wealthy parents and grows up to be Metro Man (Pitt).

Metro Man is squeaky clean and spends his time doing good deeds. He can fly and he's invulnerable. The city worships him. Megamind leaves jail and decides that he can't compete on those terms, so he decides to be bad. Metro Man is loved by the media and Roxanne Ritchi (Fey) is the reporter who plays the equivalent of Lois Lane in the story. Megamind decides to capture her to lure Metro Man into a trap. It works and Megamind discovers an apparent vulnerability in his rival, resulting in Metro man's death just 20 minutes into the movie.

The city mourns the loss of its hero and Megamind begins his reign as an evil overlord with the help of his sidekick, Minion. It's hard to hear the name Minion without thinking of Despicable Me. This Minion looks like a happy piranha balanced on the body of a robot. Some of the humor is left to our imagination. For instance, what kind of reaction would Minion get when he buys coffee and donuts to take home to Megamind?

Both movies ask us to focus on the villain and see that they are not all bad. Megamind regrets the death of Metro Man and finds that he can't adjust to life without him. He functioned better when he had a natural enemy. To remedy the situation, he develops a gun designed to infuse its victim with special powers. He inadvertently shoots Roxanne's cameraman, Hal (Hill), and decides to groom him to replace Metro Man.

Megamind has the ability to change shape for limited periods of time and that's the source of much of the humor. Hal is renamed Titan. Megamind gives him a costume and begins to school him while appearing as Jor-El and sounding like Marlon Brando. Titan isn't cut out to be a hero and struggles to learn. He eventually finds that he prefers using his powers for criminal purposes rather than for good. Megamind has created a monster.

This is where the movie deviates from the expected path somewhat. Megamind is the only one who can stand up to Titan and so he starts to become the good guy. We root for him when he's battling Titan in scenes similar to those in The Incredible Hulk when Bruce Banner fights Emil Blonsky.

There are a few more plot twists and I won't reveal them here, but the movie works. It's funny, fast-paced, and the action scenes are frequent. Megamind is a character with many frailties and we're allowed to see them. That's why we are drawn in and made to care about the outcome. Ferrell is particularly good as the voice of Megamind, but none of the actors disappoint.

Video Quality 4/5
Modern animation is well-suited to Blu-ray and usually results in flawless transfers, but Megamind falls short of a perfect rating. It looks good for the most part; colors are bright and detail is strong. However, on closer inspection, you'll find frequent aliasing. Whether it's in hair, buildings, escalators or fire escapes, you'll see it often. This causes a slight flickering which can be distracting at times. The other problem is not a fault of the transfer, but the source material. Compare Megamind to a Pixar title and you'll see what I mean. The image, particularly in the background, appears flatter and lacking in detail. It looks less realistic than something like Up. These quibbles aside, it's still a good-looking title.

Audio Quality 5/5
The English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 track does not disappoint. This is one of the better titles for showing off your sound system. There's a lot going on at all times and you'll find yourself completely immersed in the action. Ambient sounds are strong and well separated throughout. The soundtrack includes a number of driving rock songs and they sound great on this track.

Has a bit of crudeness involved but that's what makes the movie funny. I personally think that if it isn't, this movie should be rated the Best Movie of The Year. I watched it twice, the second time with my dad and he loved it. Megamind and MetroMan or whatever he was called lol were both so funny. Especially when MetroMan hilariously faked his death and started laughing histarically. And the part when he told them he was retired and started singing- o-h m-y g-o-s-h. So funny!!

4203015,5,B003UESJF6,"I've watched this movie so much my kids are sick of it, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I enjoyed the switch in the familiar pattern of hero vs. villain.  For once, the bad guy won, and when he did, it wasn't anything like he hoped.  Deep down, Megamind was never a bad guy, which is why the beginning is so important to the movie.  It was fun to watch him morph from a bad guy into a good one.

I especially liked how instead of the hero disguising himself as a normal person, it was the villain who did it.  Then he made a hero who turned out to be a truly evil villain.  At that point, he had to decide which he was going to be: the good guy or the bad guy.

I loved the movie for several reasons.  One, the usual hero/villain movie took on an unexpected twist.  Two, the humor was great.  I know some people didn't think so, but I was laughing through most of it. An example is ""You were right.  I was less right"" as an apology. Even the subtle things in how Megamind eyed Metro Man's cape was funny.  Three, it's a clean movie.  There are no subtle sexual jokes.  This is a movie I was comfortable showing to my four sons who are ages 5-8.  Four, I loved the moral of the story.  Fate isn't something that is decided for us; it's what we choose for ourselves. I'm a firm believer that we have a hand in how our lives turn out by what we do.

So this movie has a lot going for it, and though I've watched it enough to quote most of it, I'll be watching it again.",1305504000,,1483,3.9694915254237286

Film:  4/5, Picture Quality:  4/5, Audio Quality:  5/5, Extras:  4/5, Overall:  4/5

Quality:

I can detect a slight amount of jagged lines, aliasing, pixilation, and banding. But it's very slight and small, and almost unnoticeable unless you got your face glued to the screen. It's just a slight problem for me; the image still looks insanely sharp and clean, with good-looking colors and contrast (once again, I don't see a problem with coloring). I seem to remember ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" having worse issues than this. Sound quality did not disappoint.

Extras include a commentary, a bunch of documentaries, some games, a deleted scene, and plenty of other cool stuff. My copy came with a bonus DVD copy of the film as well.

My copy also came with a slipcover.

Film:

Superheroes typically win the fight and get the girl in the end, but what happens when a supervillain succeeds? We see maybe a little bit of that scenario with ""Despicable Me,"" but ""Megamind"" throws superpowers and heroism in the mix to more effectively lampoon off of the ""Superman"" mythos. As a result, we get a rather intriguing premise, gracious amounts of action and eye-candy, and quite a few amusing laughs. The comedy's nice and slappy, with plenty of funny lines. Will Ferrell's style of humor works well for the movie. It's quite fun overall, and I'd put it on the same level as ""Monsters vs Aliens.""

The story's pretty unique; it borrows a little from other sources, but once it gets going it develops a brilliant tale of deception and dramatic irony. The middle of the movie drags maybe a little, and the film overall feels a little hectic as it jumps from one mad situation to another, and then tossing one or two bizarre twists. But it all works out sublimely in the end. It also helps that the characters receive decent treatment with some solid emotional depth.

The film shows strong animation quality. Movements are smooth, textures rendering and lighting are great, and the overall designs are stylish. It's similar in style and quality to ""Monsters vs Aliens."" Voice-acting seems good; Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, Ben Stiller, are all decent. Music features a lot of rock songs, which seem a little arbitrary, but usually do fit their given scenes.

I think that was the same with this movie.  For an animated movie, the plot was very clever and had a good twist to it.  But it also had the same events that other animated movies have: the hero (or in this case, the villain) goes wrong, realizes that this isn't what he wants to do (usually because of loneliness or a romantic interest) and changes himself.

4203054,3,B003UESJF6,"Megamind was one of many big-budget animated films of 2010 that stayed away from the funny animals or princess tales common to cartoons.  This one was more of a spoof of the superman saga as embodied in the Smallville TV series.  Instead of just one hereo fleeing a doomed planet to come to Earth, we have his counterpart, Megamind, who just happens to crash land inside a prison compound.  So his story is very different from the hero.  And of course there is his jealousy, need for approval, and his henchmen, which includes a fish.  All in all, a very Will Ferrell movie, probably Ferrell's last attempt at an animated film.  The movie is not bad, but parts of it remind me of The Incredibles, especially the villian that Megamind creates for himself bears a canny resemblance to Buddy Pine.

4203060,5,B003UESJF6,"Megamind is an computer-animated comedy produced by Dreamworks and directed by Tom Mcgrath.  It features the voice talents of Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross, Ben Stiller, and Jonah Hill.  The movie takes place in a fictitious city called ""Metro City"" in modern day times.

  Plot: The story centers around Megamind (Will Ferrell) a blue alien with a problem pronouncing words who is supposedly super intelligent, (though I'm not so sure on that one) who was sent to Earth as a baby, along with his fish, Minion (David Cross).  At the same time, another baby, by the name of Metro Man(Brad Pitt), is also on his way to Earth, and outclasses Megamind in every way.  Once they arrive on earth, Metro man is sent to a mansion with a rich family, where life is handed to him on a silver platter, meanwhile Megamind is sent to the prison to be raised by inmates.  The two end up going to school together and Metro Man is the popular one because of his super powers, while Megamind is the outcast and is the last one picked for everything, such as sports (even picked after a kid with a broken leg during dodge-ball).  Megamind realizes that the only way to get respect, is to be the bad guy, and thus we fast forward to the future.  Megamind is an adult now who has become a super villain with his sidekick Minion. (who has a diving helmet with robot body taken from an old sci fi movie)  Megamind still remains arch enemy of Metro Man, and is always kidnapping his supposed girlfriend, Roxanna Ritchie (Tina Fey).  For his latest scheme he routinely kidnaps Roxanne and waits for Metro Man to come rescue her.  Megamind tricks Metro Man into getting trapped in an old observatory where plans to shoot a death ray directly at him.  While the death ray is taking forever to gather energy, Metro Man tries to escape, but the observatory is lined with copper, which Metro man claims is his weakness, so finally the death ray fires and Metro Man is incinerated, meaing that for the first time in history, bad has triumphed over good.

  Megamind can't believe his luck and celebrates by taking over the town, but after just a short time he becomes depressed and feels as though he has no purpose, and if not to make matters worse, he is starting to fall for Roxanne and is now dating her, disguised as a museum curator named Bernard (Ben Stiller).  Roxanne, unaware that she is really dating Megamind, gives him an idea to create a new super hero.  Megamind is thrilled with the idea, finally he will have a purpose again. But when he accidentally turns Roxanne's overweight, socially inept cameraman, Hal Stewart(Jonah Hill) into the new superhero, Tighten, Megamind has to train him to be just like Metro Man, a noble superhero that lives to serve the people and be the good guy.  But what if the superhero isn't such a good guy, and what if the supervillain must become the good guy to save himself and the ones he loves?  Two questions never answered until now.

  My thoughts:  At first I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this movie, the cover just seemed unappealing to me, but never judge a book by its cover, this movie is amazing.  The animation is very well done to the T.  You also will get very invested in the characters, all of them are very well portrayed and Megamind is silly and very likable.  His sidekick Minion is an ugly fish in a giant robot body, but by the end of the movie I thought he was really cute, I don't know why.
  The music is also a great addition to this movie, instead of kiddie songs, we get Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N Roses, AC/DC, and even Michael Jackson.  I loved this soundtrack, there aren't too many kids movie I would consider buying the soundtrack for lol.
  So in conclusion, this is an instant hit, a lot of people were drawn away from it like me in the beginning because of the cover, but looks can be deceiving, this movie is great for kids and adults alike, and I recommend it to anyone.",1302739200,,3930,4.482419127988749

4203078,3,B003UESJF6,"Megamind is a fun and silly experience.  This is pure fun and I love the concept of what happens when the super villain actually wins.  The downfall is that it can lead to a labored and boring plot which lacks focus and can seem tedious and boring.  The great flaw in this movie is that it is too mopey and doesn't have the wry humor of a Toy Story or makes us see more about our self like Wall-E does. Megamind ranks more like a half baked romantic comedy then a wired over the top

I also think this movie could have benefited more from Will Ferrall's edgy brand of humor.  He was so muted here as to be almost invisible. The obtuseness of Megamind was funny for a while but it went dry very quickly. I think this is a cute movie but I have to say I think it could have been funnier.",1302480000,,785,4.038709677419355
4203079,3,B003UESJF6,"I don't especially care for Will Ferrell's humor. In fact, I go out of my way to tell people that I spell my last name differently than he does (Farrell/Ferrell). I'm not entirely sure why I dislike his acting and comedy so much; I just don't. I was underwhelmed by his performance in Stranger Than Fiction, though I respected the attempt at a more serious role (of course, he hasn't done anything even remotely similar since), but, on the whole, I tend to avoid his comedy/acting...the man entirely.

That being said, I honestly never thought that I would see a movie in which I empathize and sincerely care about a character voiced by him.

When I first saw the trailer for Megamind, I was immediately interested, before I knew who was providing the voice for the title character. Upon finding out, I was taken aback, since the movie seemed different from his usual faire; not so much his traditional humor, though the repeated lines about ""unbelievably handsome"" seemed a little rich and midly annoying within a 1 minute teaser trailer. Still, I was optimistic about the casting choice (encouraged by Tina Fey's involvement) and looked forward to seeing the movie. The concept was interesting, the characters amusing and fun.

Now, though it took me two viewings, I've come to the conclusion that I do, genuinely, like the film, in spite of Ferrell and in spite of the film's many and distinctive flaws.

As far as positives go, the film was surprisingly sweet and adorable.  There were several remarkable moments that stood out, pure gems - much like ones in How to Train Your Dragon. They came off the screen and touched you, emotionally...even in plain, ol' 2D. I didn't expect that from a kids' comedy that's supposedly poking fun at superheroes and comic book canon. I wasn't at all prepared for a romantic sub-plot or an underlying theme about the desire for acceptance and companionship, about fitting in and just trying to belong. In one specific scene in the beginning, there's a brief moment where we see a photograph of Megamind's class, where he and his Minion are standing entirely separate from the rest of the group, off to the side. In spite of that isolation, both of them wear smiles. In that one instant, you completely sympathize. It took me right back to my early school days and how very tough a time it could be. And I certainly didn't have a giant blue head, cause accidental disasters, or live in a prison.

On a more cheerful note, I enjoyed tremendously the motifs the film played with; not just the superhero-stuff, but the clash of musical styles. I loved that Metro Man is, essentially, Elvis (even down to the joke that he's still alive somewhere), and that Megamind is sort of a personification of classic rock, complete with the black leather and silver spikes. They are both extremely theatrical, but in entirely different ways. But the superher0 references and puns are, without a doubt, a great deal of fun and wholeheartedly amusing.

It has to be said, too, that a sure-fire way to impress me is for a film that's released in 3-D to be completely enjoyable in 2-D. Megamind did. There are some scenes here and there where it's clear the filmmakers played around with the device, sure, but it managed to still be subtle about it.  A million brownie points earned. That's two films in a row - keep it up, Dreamworks.

On the other hand, the film is NOT without it's problems. While the heart of the movie lies in the characters, specifically Megamind's inner yearning to belong and be normal, the film more bluntly pushes the idea of ""destiny"" and ""what makes you who you are."" It comes across as conflicting, almost confusing, as though you have to switch back and forth between two themes. The ideal situation would be that they compliment each other and that one, ultimately, stands over the other, but they honestly seem to be side-by-side and it's frustrating; it made the film seem disjointed in places, rather than cohesive. I think a bit more time in story development would have done the film a lot of good. Not to mention some re-writes on the often clich&eacute; dialogue.

It comes back to a fundamental difference between Dreamworks and Pixar.  People often tell me that they can't keep the two studios' work straight, as far as which released which films. To me, it's ridiculously blatant. While both studios are brilliant when it comes to the quality of the animation itself, Dreamworks tends to rely more on humor, gags and antics, whereas Pixar's films dig deeper and really flesh out their themes, characters and emotional core. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was the first time I saw Dreamworks really compare to the likes of ""Toy Story,"""" ""Monsters' Inc.,"" or ""Up."" I'm not sure that ""Megamind"" did. It had all the potential in the world - it had all the right pieces, but they didn't fit together properly - not the way they could have, anyway - and it shows. It's like... ""the little movie that could've.""

In the end, though, apart from a slightly weak ending, the film was fun, enjoyable and surprisingly sweet and endearing. Will Ferrell somehow managed to not be obnoxious to those of us who usually can't stand him, and I'm sure his fans will be quite pleased with his performance. As I said after I saw him in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" I respected the gamble and had hoped to see him take on similar roles in the future (though steer clear of things like my beloved ""Bewitched""). It would seem that this go-round was much better than anything thus far, at least in my humble opinion. Here's hoping he continues in this direction.

I recommend this movie, but as long as you go in with an open mind.

Megamind, I found, has great animation, but forgot one very important factor that any good
animation always delivers; You have to like the characters; and there was nothing really
likeable about any of these characters!
The main superhero is all about ego. The woman reporter is a cardboard cliche. The villian
that Megamind creates is a total jerk. Megamind's minion can only be described as weird,
-and the homage to ""Robot Monster"" doesn't work. That leaves Megamind himself to relate to,
-and I cant! At the end of the movie, he is still totally egotistical and self indulgent.
All of the plot twists did not help to warm up to him and his changes of heart seem superfluous.

4203096,5,B003UESJF6,"I've seen this movie four times in two weeks. The last time I loved a movie enough to watch it that many times was in 1987, at the age of 13.  I'm 37 now, and much more critical about quality in movies than I was then, and I tell you now that Megamind is a brilliant film.

They Got It Right.  This movie incorporates the best elements that we've all seen before, remarkably few flaws, and turns out a hilarious, intelligent movie with a lot of heart. And kid-safe, too, although adults will get a lot more of the in-jokes.

First, the humor.  This movie is just plain fun to watch!  Just the right balance between silly-slapstick and witty irony, lots of hilarious one-liners, references to other sci-fi films and comics, and, rare for an animated film, tiny subtle shifts in body language that betray what a character is thinking without any words necessary.

Next, the characters.  All five of the main characters have a surprising amount of depth, making it easy to empathize with them, in part due to the gorgeous animation and incredibly realistic facial expressions.  Megamind in particular has very expressive eyebrows, and you can literally see wrinkles appear in his forehead when he's upset, or smile lines in his cheeks when he gives that irrepressibly gleeful grin of his...you can't help but love him.

The Story:  Megamind begins the movie as a mischievous, fun-loving, blue-skinned alien super-genius with a crush on pixie-haired reporter Roxanne Ritchi, (whose cameraman, Hal, also has his sights set on her) and a love of playing ""the game"" with the other (human-looking) resident alien, Metroman.  Metroman is not the typical Superman clone he appears to be at the beginning, either.

Having been raised in the city prison, Megamind is inexperienced, almost innocent, about many things in the outside world, which is one more reminder for us of his outsider status despite his being culturally of Earth. His only companion is his best friend Minion, a loyal fish sent with him to Earth who wears a robot gorilla suit.

The Twist:  When Megamind unexpectedly wins the ""game"", he is at a loss.  A surprise meeting with Roxanne while in disguise as a handsome museum curator abruptly changes the course of his life (and this movie!) Megamind experiences a phenomenal amount of character growth, a coming-of-age that is rife with hilarious zaniness and agonizing drama with a show-stopper finale ends on an incredibly satisfying note.

There are several extras you'll want to check out; all the standard stuff plus a sweet-sad deleted scene, an animated comic book that lets you see some of the past battles between Megamind and Metroman, and a 16-minute short adventure (Button of Doom, either included on the Blu-ray or make sure to get the DVD set that has it!), set after the movie that has Megamind hilariously battling one of his own inventions!

Gorgeous animation: The sheer amount of rich detail in this film make it worth watching many times. I highly recommend the Blu-ray, though, I watched a dvd version and you couldn't make out details like young Megamind's sheepish, sad-yet-hopeful smile in the class picture.  And unlike several other reviewers, I didn't notice any aliasing at all, and I looked for it.

All the characters have such tender attention to detail, including fingerprints, realistic freckles, and eyes that reflect different colors from the sources of light around them.  I'm not a fan of weapon design, but Megamind's De-gun (a ray gun that has multiple functions, including dehydrating animate objects instantly so they shrink into small cubes) has what looks like decorative bronze insets in graceful curves, truly lovely to behold.  The glass catwalks in the museum are beautiful, too.

Who won't care for Megamind?  In middle of the film is light on action and things blowing up, as Megamind learns to care for Roxanne while developing a plan centered around Hal, which could bore some die-hard action fans or young children.

I also appreciate the lessons taught: The choices you make control your destiny, not fate.  Intelligence will win out over brawn.  Prejudice is wrong and unfair.  Forgiveness.  Redemption.  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade...or giant robots!",1301702400,,4228,4.990014265335235

4203134,5,B003UESJF6,"Ah, the ""Dreamworks face""... that half-smirking look that title characters on dreamworks-made features are (in)famous for having, whether they could physically do such a face in reality or not. It's reached an almost anti-meme status, and Megamind's promo material seems particularly guilty of flashing this particularly odd remark. Looking past that though, would be to your credit. Megamind may literally be one of their best pieces of work I'd seen.

Starting with a particularly amusing narrative, Megamind finds himself starting on the wrong side of fate and destiny, while his rival would start with the silver spoon of sorts. And even with being regularly defeated, Megamind shows the standard comic-book variety drive of a villain who never stops, always wanting to plot another plan for his singular and strongest rival. But it is when one of his plans does appear to work, that he realizes how different it is without a challenge. In trying to create a new nemesis, the plan to once again have balance backfires, and it becomes time for Megamind to put his brilliance to a new purpose. At least, that's about as much as I could say without completely spoiling it for anyone that didn't see it or at least didn't already read the synopsis available on IMDB.

The first thing that took me by surprise with the movie, is Will Ferrel's performance for the lead role. Primarily, because it actually felt... natural, and suited to the character, at last. In his previous works, I would always find him either just being forceful about his role to the point of irritating, or completely out of place in a scene because he seems to try to 'force' things or take them too far. This is probably the first time in a long time, where he didn't do any of these things... and where everything about it just felt right. The awkwardness of his brand of humor fit snugly with that of megamind's existence... even to the purposely mispronounced words and character acting. When seeing it, I initially had no idea it was will Ferrel, simply because it didn't feel like another Will Ferrel(tm) schlock job. Even now, I don't feel like I'm listening to Will Ferrel... and that's impressive.

Megamind (the movie) also does some pretty good nods to comic and superhero cliche's... just enough to give a nod or satire, while being brief enough to keep the focus on the main part of the plot... the interactions that go on with the character and the ranges of emotion that happen in such a case. The big blue baddie was simply content in having a challenge. The goal might have been to ""take over"" Metro City, but he realizes how empty that was. And when he realizes certain things about his typical ""bait"" for the hero, finds that maybe there was more reason than simply to have a 'prize' for the hero to rescue. And when his plan to have a new challenger backfires, it then becomes time to find a new purpose... and it is this story that is told very well in this movie.

Though I only have the BluRay copy, I find it odd that Dreamworks didn't (to my knowledge) publish it as a BD3D feature, given that this movie is constantly referenced as one of the better ""users"" of 3D as a film-making form of progress. Honestly, I find it rather embarrassing on my part that I had so little knowledge of what this movie was about while it was in theaters. If I had known I would like it this much, I would have actually gone to see it in 3D to see how good it would look. But I'm afraid that doing so would then make me want to spend the mega-bucks it would take to have a 3D-capable TV and player setup.

Even the extra feature short on the BluRay (which takes place the next day after the events of the movie) was very well done, and fits into things nicely. No doubt a sequel will be planned, if it's not in the works. Here's hoping that Dreamworks is able to give us more of this kind of production quality... I'll even put up with a poster full of ""Dreamworks face"" if it means the next movie is as good as this one.",1301270400,,4000,4.526970954356846

4203144,4,B003UESJF6,"I have to say, maybe I dropped my review from 4 to 3.5 stars due to watching a funnier, cuter movie right before it but it's still worth your $$ and 3.5 - 4 stars is a very respectable rating.
You may wonder what I watched right before it? Despicable Me. Yeah, that was so cute and funny that Megamind kinda seemed to fall short.
But, I will still rate it pretty good since it definately does entertain and has extra features that are pretty good as well.
Trailers I had seen had shown Megamind (Will Ferrel) as simply an anti-hero and he was fighting Titan (Jonah Hill). This is not the case. If you saw that trailer, do not be fooled.
It is a story of - Lets say - Superman didn't fall to a little homestead in Kansas but to a prison instead? What if every time he tried to make friends, it just backfired and he eventually realized that he is good at being bad? But, another alien took your destiny from you and has had the good life (Metro Man - Brad Pitt)? Battles occur between the two that they both follow the rules of, ""thou shalt not kill but only imprison."" until one of Megamind's ultimate weapons ""kills"" Metro Man. Now, he has no enemy, is bored and decides to create a new hero using Metro Man's DNA. This backfires as all his plans do and the hero (Titan) decides to be a villian. Titan does not follow any rules and steals, destroys, even tries to kill Megamind and the reporter Roxi (voiced by Tina Fey).
Megamind and his minion (a fish with a mecha-gorilla body voiced by David Cross) must find a way to stop Titan.
I like Jonah Hill in most of his work but here in this movie he is a nerd that you don't feel sorry for and he is a loser for more reason than one. If they had given us a better reason to hate him, I'd have liked his villian character more. Simply being imbalanced mentally is not a fun villian.
The only reason it's not a 5 star movie is that it is for the best of the best or something that blows you away. This won't do that. It's worth the $$ and is entertaining. The special features are worth watching as well. You will not feel shorted.",1301011200,2,2078,4.1716417910447765

4203153,5,B003UESJF6,"...Try being a Super Villain. That is what the film 'Megamind' is all about. Dreamworks took the classic good vs. evil battle and gave all of us the answer to that burning question. So, what exactly does happen when evil finally triumphs? Megamind is Metro City's most notorious villain and all he wants to do is finally thwart Metroman or as he prefers to call him...Mr. Goody Two-shoes. After years and years of planning and plotting he finally did it! Then suddenly, something unusual happens...Megamind has nothing to do! He then realizes...there is only one thing left to do, create a new hero. Now, he has that accomplished it looks like the new hero has plans of his own and they are not for the good of mankind.

This film was such a great comedy. While Pixar gave us 'The Incredible', 'Megamind' is a completely different story that plays on the fan boy fantasies. Throw a great comedic cast together and some of the best CGI Dreamworks has given us in years and you get a classic. Will Ferrel, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt give us a great combination of laughs and heart. It brings us into the minds of heroes and villains and shows us that they actually are more than just crazy gadgets and cheesy monologues. They are people and when the action takes a back seat in this film you see it and it is done quite well. Probably the biggest surprise in this film is David Cross as the voice of Minion. He always runs hot and cold with the average movie goers, but this time he shines and gives us such awesome moments in the film. It's the smart comedy and the timing of the jokes that makes this movie a real winner.

If you are a parent looking for a movie for your young ones or if you are a classic comic book geek 'Megamind' delivers a one two punch. It was one of the most overlooked films of last year and a great ride from beginning to end.",1300579200,,1860,4.357348703170029

The plot I would give just 1 star because right from the beginning it was just like the Superman -story: the child from a distant planet is sent away to the earth, falls in love with a news reporter girl, has trouble telling about his love to her.

I've seen it before in over a dozen iterations but for some reason Megamind really speaks to me. Maybe it's the acting, I mean animation, which is nuanced and lovely. Maybe it's the fact that I'm drawn to misunderstood underdogs and blue men with hypnotic eyes.

One star docked for predictability. Otherwise, it's a humorous tale. It's the first time I've enjoyed a performance by Will Ferrell since Stranger Than Fiction.

The only warning I'd give is the sarcastic lines by Titan when he tells Roxanne that she always tries to find the good in people even when none exists.  He says ""There is no Easter Bunny"", ""There is no Tooth Fairy"" and ""There is no Queen of England""...  My kids love this part of the movie and I keep hearing my 8 yr old laughing every so often and saying ""There is no Queen of England""  ha ha ha ha ha... so no issues here (so far) but just something to be aware of.

4203187,4,B003UESJF6,"I have to admit it; I think I let my expectations for this one get a little out of control.  As out of control as Megamind's ambitions of world domination? Well maybe not quite that bad, but still, despite plans of doing my best to maintain a level head going in, I was pretty swept up in the hype surrounding this big budget computer animated feature.  So did it live up to such stratospheric expectations you ask?  Surprisingly, yes it did and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that the film does a fantastic job of referencing the little nuances that comic book heroes (or most pertinently, villains) have to endure to keep the hero, well, heroic.

Kinda like another tale we're all familiar with, this film opens with a world in eminent danger of being sucked into a black hole and some loving parents placing their infant child into an escape pod.  With his pet/ protector (a fish named Minion), young Megamind (Will Ferrell) finds himself hurdling toward a small blue planet at the edge of the Milky Way only his exodus isn't the only one taking place.

Apparently another planet, one with very human-like inhabitants, had very similar ambitions for the survival of their species and sent a pod of their own.

In true born loser fashion, this second pod enjoys a smooth trip to Earth and lands on the property of a rich loving couple while Megamind's route traverses endless asteroid belts before finally landing within the gated walls of a prison.  With very different upbringings, a rivalry is born between the two alien refugees only unlike the do-gooding Metro Man (Brad Pitt), Megamind has no real powers save for a massive brain.  Since Metro Man has the ""city's good guy"" role pretty well filled, Megamind has little choice but to take up villainy.

Despite a pretty good heart, Megamind finds himself repeating tried and true schemes like kidnapping news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) only to end up in a custom-painted cellblock in Metro City's prison.

Things take an incredible twist when the villain actually gets the upper hand and the reality of the hero/villain symbiotic relationship is finally made clear to Megamind.

There's a few central questions behind Megamind, that actually serve as the catalyst for the entire prose, many of which fans of comic books will really take to heart.  Sure on the surface what we're looking at is essentially a spoof at the Superman/ Lex Luthor relationship (with a little Lois Lane thrown in for good measure) only unlike the famous DC tale, DreamWorks slaps a few welcomed twisted to the equation.  Not the least of these is what if the bad guy didn't want to be evil so much as it was forced upon him from the onset.  Another really explores the idea that the relationship between the hero and the villain is one that demands the presence of the other to work.

The latter has been explored in films like 1999's Mystery Men but the point is really driven home here in MegaMind.

The comedy feels a little bit strained at times but the cast here just plays so well off one another that laughter's inevitable regardless of the viewer's mood going in.  Will Farrell dazzles with his trademark blend of casual dryness and additional props are due to David Cross as Minion and Jonah Hill as Titan.

Pacing is quit spot on, and actually succeeds over Pixar's superhero attempt ""The Incredibles""- which did bog down in spots.  Megamind is consistently lively, enthusiastic and visually rich.

Hans Zimmer is responsible for the scoring here and does his usual charming work even if the softer tones are often lost to the wailing guitars of Guns n Roses and AC/DC (even the late Michael Jackson isn't overlooked on this explosively charged soundtrack).

About the biggest complaint I've located surrounding this film is that the whole genre has been covered by Pixar's Incredibles and Universal's Despicable Me and this is a valid concern, although a legitimate argument can be made that compared directly against Pixar's 2004 entry, these latter two pieces serve as reminders to the ever-advancing computer generated film industry.  From a visual standpoint, the small details are just outstanding.  Perfection of facial systems, textures and lighting simulations are evident in nearly every frame here.

In all I have to confess that DreamWorks' collective grasp on the medium of computer generated feature filmmaking is subtly becoming masterful, if undeniably commercial.  While biggest rival Pixar is often limited by what can be accomplished within the confines of a G rating, DW seems increasingly proficient at packing as much into their PG pictures as possible.  There is no confusing the fact that this is an adult-oriented comedy that children will enjoy too (not the other way around).

Considering the past two DreamWorks releases were How to Train Your Dragon and MegaMind, it's clear that Disney/ Pixar has their proverbial hands full.  Megamind may not be quite as butter-smooth, adventurous, or as grand-scoped as How to Train Your Dragon but it does harken back to the type of pacing and comedic brilliance viewers have come to expect from films like Kung-Fu Panda.  Megamind offers a whole lot of fun, some solid visuals, and an interesting spin on the ""Man of Steel"" legacy.",1299283200,5,5264,4.868834080717488
4203188,5,B003UESJF6,"For someone who is not yet in their tweens, this is a 5 star movie. For adults it is a 3 star movie. Megamind and Metro Man both are hurled to the earth from dying planets. Metro Man bumps out Megamind from a good home and lands our blue ""hero"" in prison. Megamind believes he is destined to be the villain his whole life, so he acts the role and harasses Metro Man, an unlikeable egotistical good guy as well as Metro City. After he successfully kills Metro Man and wins, his life is boring without a challenge so he creates a hero to fight himself, Titan Man.

At this point I won't ruin the plot twists. Classic Rock and Pop is used as theme songs for the bad guy which made the movie confusing for me. ;)The sound track was 5 stars. What was unfortunate was the actors they chose to read the lines. They added nothing to the movie. When Lithgow, Murphy, and Diaz do a movie, their voices add to the story. This was not the case with Ferrell, Fey, Hill, Cross and Pitt. Could you imagine Eddie Murphy instead of Ferrell? Simply a better movie.",1299283200,,1046,4.256281407035176

We both like comics though I am way ahead in reading them than he is.  We decided to pop this disc in late one night bordering dangerously close to his bedtime, I was far more interested in seeing it than he was.  He informed me if he got too tired or if it couldn't hold his interest, no worries, he'd not be offended if I watched it without him / didn't want to break it up into a two day movie spree.  He watched it in one sitting and only got up when they broke into dance and song at the last minute just as the credits were starting.

You really don't need to know much of it -  It tackles most of the oldest  questions that lead to debates amongst comic nerds, most notably:  What will the villain do if he truly rids himself of the good guy to battle?

Its one part original movie, one part spoof / tribute to the good old classics we all know and love, one part super predictable.

Who cares which characters make a surprise comeback as you didn't care when they left in the beginning.  Plus, was Megamind that terrible to begin with?

The storyline and humor is just okay, nothing really special.  The casts are funny and great.  IMO, it didn't bring the real humor of Will Ferrel.

4203210,5,B003UESJF6,"And there came a day when Lex Luthor finally slew Superman, when Doctor Doom outwitted Reed Richards, when the World bested Scott Pilgrim, when Elmer Fudd finally bagged Bugs Bunny. It's rare that a super-villain achieves his end goal, and so you can't blame Megamind for being out of sorts when ultimate triumph finally came his way. I thought DESPICABLE ME was really terrific, and then the similarly-themed MEGAMIND came along and I enjoyed it even better than DESPICABLE ME.

I've never liked Will Ferrell better. The cast is across-the-board fine, but Ferrell had to carry the load, and he hits all the right notes as Megamind, playing up the megalomaniacal side while retaining enough wounded vulnerability that you can't help but root for the bad guy. The movie sets out to make Megamind sympathetic from jump, opening with a passage which chronicles baby Megamind's rocky rocket ship flight from his doomed native planet to Earth. The little guy is established as a hard luck character, thanks to his early thunder getting stolen by another infant - destined to grow up as the superhero Metro Man - also fleeing a dying world. It's this second, aesthetically more pleasing baby who settles under the Christmas tree in a posh mansion and a silver spoon upbringing. Little Megamind's rocket ship, knocked off course by the other baby's ship, careens straight into a maximum security prison, where the baby grows up mentored by hardened convicts. It's that old Nature versus Nurture conundrum again, only played out in tights. Growing up blue-skinned, bulbous-noggined, friendless except for his fish sidekick, and in school always picked last for everything, an embittered boy determines to be villainous.

Which is cool, since the villain of the piece is almost always more interesting. Metro City's champion, Metro Man, is adored by the citizens, glorified even by the local television reporter, Roxanne Ritchi: ""His heart is an ocean inside a bigger ocean,"" she gushes. But dude's a bore. Megamind's greatest asset, we eventually learn, is his tenacity. Year after year his flamboyant criminal acts are confounded by Metro Man. But there's no quit in Megamind. And then, one day, shockingly, Megamind finally comes out on top. Not even he expected that.

The film looks fantastic with its bright colors and impeccable animation. It's almost a shame that we've gotten used to animation graphics being this stellar nowadays, because it does take away from this film's visual accomplishments. But, with that being a given, it all comes down to the story content, like it always should. MEGAMIND offers snappy one-liners and many wonderful visual gags, and I grin whenever Megamind mispronounces Metro City (to something that rhymes with ""monstrosity"") and also when Titan spells his name as ""Tighten."" But there's also a core narrative which is textured and laced with a richness and nice bits of character development, with the most thought provoking element centering around a villain's melancholy. Megamind finds that holding dominion over Metro City isn't as gratifying when no hero comes to save the day. Long moments of agonizing produce a solution, and so Megamind quickly puts his plan into motion. He'll invent a superhero to challenge him again, create his very own playmate. Good thing Metro Man has dandruff.

It's a neat topsy-turvying of superhero conventions, and I don't think anyone will miss out on all the references, from the awesome nod to Marlon Brando's Jor-El to the sassy news reporter (and token damsel in distress) Roxanne Ritchi, obviously a Lois Lane clone. Tina Fey makes her come alive, and Roxanne actually provides the story's grounding element. Her strange relationship with Megamind figures in many of the film's emotionally satisfying moments. Meanwhile, her creepy cameraman also pines for Roxanne, except that she wants no truck with him. That last sentence, by the way, drips with foreshadowing.

MEGAMIND isn't quite as top shelf as THE INCREDIBLES or as evocative as TOY STORY or WALL-E, but it's marvelous enough with its heart and pathos and non-stop laughs. Even more than Gru, I rooted like mad for this underdog to win out, to beat his adversary, to get the girl, to find acceptance. ""I did my best. But he was too fantastic!"" wails Megamind in an early scene. I wasn't looking for that in the climax.

This single DVD's bonus material: the filmmakers' audio commentary; ""Meet the Cast of MEGAMIND"" (00:09:22 minutes long); the deleted toothbrush scene (00:01:34 minutes), and the ""World of DreamWorks Animation"" which showcases song excerpts and selected video game and DVD promos for the KUNG FU PANDA, MADAGASCAR, and SHREK franchises, and for HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.",1298764800,11,4724,5.112694300518135
4203211,5,B003UESJF6,"I won't go into a lengthy synopsis since others have done so, but I was very VERY pleasantly surprised at just how well put together and endearing this animated romp was. Particularly since I was terribly disappointed in Despicable Me and couldn't make it past 20 minutes in of Desp Me.

Much like The Incredibles it 'stars' a superhero (actually supervillain) and gives his history over the years, followed by a sequence of events which turns the tables on the situation. It even has a nerdy guy transformed into a superpowered villain to battle our protagonist ala Incredibles.

Not since The Incredibles has a movie found the right mix of hilarity coupled with exciting action  which has you wondering ""how is this thing gonna turn out?"".
I found myself really caring about the characters and this has certainly never been true with a Dreamworks animated feature before.

Great Flic!!

The 'Button of Doom' feature is a 15 minute short on a separate DVD. Chronologically it takes place just after the end of the full feature. If you are like me and want more Megamind it's worth the extra sheckels.

4203212,4,B003UESJF6,"Seriously, this film was not bad, but it didn't quite make the ""great"" category, either. It is the story of a supervillain, Megamind, who, finally, defeats his nemesis. This one had a lot of potential, setting up the supervillain-superhero epic conflict well, in a humorous manner (funny, at least, in a culture that has suffered through countless superhero stories, few of which have ever been worthy of a second glance)...and then...well, then what? Outrageous can be good, and worked to carry the beginning of the movie...but there has to be more...outrageous has to morph into genuinely funny, and not just because it plays outlandishly off of something that the audience is already familiar with, at some point. Megamind didn't really do this. Certainly, there were a few funny jokes (feeling mulonKULy, anyone?), but it relied too much on ""see how crazy this is?"" and too little on actual puns. Also, very little time was allotted to showing us how Megamind actually became bored with his victory (one of the pivotal pieces of the story)...one minute, he's victoriously looting the city, destroying fire trucks, and whatnot...and the next he's having a heart-to-heart with a plastic desk toy. Uhhh, did I miss something there?

All of that said, there were moments that were better than others...like, the way the new villain figures out that he's battling Megamind during the final fight scene...and, the film is visually appealing, so kids will no doubt find it fascinating. If you're looking for something mildly amusing in the superhero/supervillain genre, this film will not waste your time. It's not quite on the same level of ""Despicable Me"", but it's heads and shoulders above ""The Incredibles"". 3.5/5 stars",1298764800,2,1721,5.124555160142349

But what's this crap with just the 2D version? This isn't the only movie doing it either. If the studios want to sell me movies that came out in 3D, they can make a ******* 3D version. I bought the 3D movies I like in 3D. I didn't buy the ones not available in 3D. See how that works studios? You have to put out a product I want, or I won't buy it. I am so sick of all the double and triple dipping with the special additions and such as well.

I bought Despicable Me, because Universal had the good sense to give it a proper 3D release. So what's the deal Paramount? Where is my 3D version of this?

When I buy a TV, they don't tell me all they have is the basic model, and maybe if I'm lucky, they'll sell the deluxe version later. If I order a fillet, they don't tell me ""Maybe another time, have this sirloin instead."" I would like this in the highest quality.

4203246,5,B003UESJF6,"I love Megamind.

I shouldn't.  I'm not particularly fond of Will Ferrell, who often seems to be adlibbing to amuse only himself.  I'm over the whole ""superheroes are celebrities"" angle.  And at this point I think we all know most villains are just misunderstood.

But Megamind nails it.  Ferrell, as Megamind, is a giant blue-headed geek that's easy to sympathize because he's not a muscle-bound villain.  He's the scheming nerd to rival Metro Man's (Brad Pitt, but it should have been Bruce Campbell) ridiculous physical stature.  Megamind, you see, is a victim of his upbringing, raised in a prison, unlike his rival Metro Man who was raised on a farm.  The two go to school together and Megamind learns quickly that being smart isn't the same as being popular.

Tina Fey is pitch-perfect as Roxanne Ritchi, lending a cute lisp to a gal reporter that has played the damsel in distress a dozen times too many. She has the majority of the dialogue and shoulders it well.

Rounding out the cast is Minion (David Cross), a fish in a robotic gorilla suit. Cross, like Ferrell, can occasionally overdo it, but here his comedy is perfectly nuanced as a worrywart mother-figure that happens to be a fish in a gorilla suit. He and Ferrell are a great team, like an old married couple that just happens to share a supervillain lair.

All these characters' fates collide when Megamind finally succeeds in killing Metro Man.  Momentarily elated, Megamind discovers that life isn't quite the same without his archnemesis. It leaves him feeling hollow, and Megamind soon comes to realize that the issue isn't Metro Man, but himself.  Two competing interests help fill the void in the form of his burgeoning romance with Ritchi (disguised as Bernard) and his mentoring of new superhero Tighten.

There are two other characters that actually carry much of the plot: Bernard (Ben Stiller) and Tighten (Jonah Hill).  Bernard is the alter-ego of Megamind, who puts his hologram device to work by disguising himself as a hapless museum curator.  Tighten (originally Titan, but kids these days!)  is the inverse of Megamind - if Megamind is a nerd with outside ambitions, Tighten is a geek with no ambition whatsoever.

What Megamind does so well is contrast the supervillain archetype.  Every nerd has faced off against a jock and felt inferior. Every geek secretly harbors a brilliant, raging Megamind-like ego and a needy, insecure Tighten. And for every clean-cut celebrity espousing healthy living and high morals, there's a heavy metal opposite who craves the same spotlight.  Megamind and Metro Man are also Gen X heroes, representing the uncertainty of thirty-somethings trying to figure out what they want to be now that they've grown up.  The contrast is heightened by Tighten, a Gen Y punk who would rather waste his superhero powers playing videogames (kids these days!).

In the end, what Megamind does best can be summed up in the one word he uses to distinguish a true supervillain from a jerk: PRESENTATION!",1297900800,11,3005,4.942231075697211
4203247,4,B003UESJF6,"The movie Mega Mind, by Tom McGrath, was one o the best animation movies of the year since Finding Nemo. It's an action, comedy, and silly yet a great animation that is worth the watch. As a Christian, talking about a secular movie, I would say that this movie is safe even for the younger ears in the family because they sugar code some inappropriate languages. The movie picked a perfect roll for the voice actors, the special effects in the animations, and a plot that keeps you interested through the whole movie.
The voice character's are all well known people who you can relate too when it comes to comedy. Will Ferrell was one of the voice actors and in fact he was playing the main character name Mega Mind. His voice fit perfectly for the character's personality. Will Ferrell had the voice of an evil genius during that role and with his comedian skills he had made the character flawless. A famous actor name Brad Pitt, who I have now see that he is more into comedy, decided to play the main hero of the story, Metro Man. At first in the story he had a little serious act for his role until you seen the whole movie. It had a good twist that will leave you laughing. Tina Fey, a well known comedian in Saturday Night Live, comes back from a retirement in SNL and surprises us by playing a role in Mega Mind, Roxanne. She played the typical girl character that all ways get kidnapped. The perfect part of her character is that she makes her character sarcastic and not like the woman that cries for help all the time, like in most super hero movies. In conclusion, these characters brought out the movie well, and of course the sub characters like Jonah Hill from ""Get Him to Greek"", and David Cross from ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"".
The special effects in the movie are something worth mentioning because it came out really well. The director, Tom McGrath, who was also know for Madagascar, made a perfect action sequence that even surpass The Incredible, in my opinion. Mega Mind action and special effects has brought something to the table, not even Superman, the movie, couldn't bring out to entertain most audiences. Although Mega Mind was suppose to bring out a ""copy"" of a Superman like storyline, it had made it to a story that will make you wish that was Superman's main story from the beginning. Mega Mind would have to be the best Villain / Hero of the year. The reason why I say this is because he just presented himself to the audience what a true genius he could be. You wouldn't find any bad guys that kids would love in a million years. One of the fiction character, played my Jonah Hill, name Tighten (Ironically not spelled as Titan). He was the character that shocked the audience. Tighten became someone or something you didn't expect to happen to him. With a nice twist, Tighten was the spice in the movie, the way he uses power and the special effect was just amazing. One aspect would be the obsession with Roxanne; he would do anything it takes to get her. The characteristic for Minion was very creative, the way they put him together. Minion, the side kick of Mega Mind, brings you back memories of the animation movie ""Hercules"". How Pegasus was with Hercules since born and been with him till the end, watching, and guiding him. That's how Minion but in an evil silly version. Voice actor David Cross, who was know for playing Dave's boss in ""Alvin and the Chimp-monks"", just made the character cute and very evil. He is just the perfect sick kick an evil villain can ask for, in a good way. Super Star Brad Pitt played the Former Hero of the story, or should I say Mega Mind's rival, Metro Man (Ironically name after the city they live in). Metro Man is what you would expect being Super man like. Seeing from the movie he is like imaging Super man giving up on all he has done just because he was tried of being a Super hero. It was nice to see that this character wasn't the main hero of the movie because it would have been too clich. As I was saying, Metro Man was the character to boost up Mega Mind's appearance and appreciation  more then he was suppose to be and he made it happen. In conclusion, the special feature and the character background was just amazing put together.
If you were to watch any introduction of Super man movie you will see the semblance that Mega Mind uses. Mega Mind would be the satire version of Super Man the movie. But Brainiac would be the main character of the story. As a said before this plot would be like if everything goes wrong, bad guy wins and good guy loses. What I love about the plot is how Mega Mind has to change up his character since being a bad guy without a good guy made him nothing and lonely.
In conclusion, the story Mega Mind was an outstanding piece of comedy art that made it worth to watch, in my opinion. Having a well picked voice actors, neat special effects and an interesting plot uplifts the movie to a must watch with friends, a party, or with family. Any family can enjoy their favorite actor's voice, since they are so popular, without a doubt. Special effect will also surprise you and the audience because it feels so fresh. This story will keep you interested until the unfortunate ending of the movie. I would say that this movie is definite recommended.",1296691200,3,5271,4.456521739130435
4203248,5,B003UESJF6,"MegaMind stands apart from a great many of its peers through the simple fact that the story works on so many levels.  Others have commented on the spectacular imagery (which works as well in 2D as 3D), the action, humor, and a plethora of other imagery - but, as so often the case, rarely look beneath the surface.  It is refreshing to watch a movie with true depth in this modern age of 'instant gratification.

'Depth' is the most apt attribute which can be ascribed to this movie.  No matter how many times it is viewed, there is always something new to discover - so many layers that no single review could possibly cover them all.

The title character, MegaMind, doesn't stand alone as a victim of circumstance - ALL the principle characters are.  They, like so many of us, go through life with blinders on; knowing only the station assigned through Fate.  The story gives each of them the opportunity to 'fill other shoes' and, through their discoveries, allow us to garner similar perspective of ourselves.

No point in belaboring with spoilers but, even if you've already seen the movie countless times, try watching it again with this in mind.  You just might amaze yourself at what you discover.",1296518400,5,1205,4.7

4203281,5,B003UESJF6,"So usually when I watch an animated film, I catch the little jokes that the writers put in there that are of a slightly sexual nature. Watching Megamind, I found none of those. I loved this movie and I'm 21!! I feel like I can play this movie around the children of my family without worrying that they're going to pick up something bad that their parents will then blame me for. I will admit, there are jokes that go over children's heads, but those jokes are intellectual like the mispronunciation of words, not sex-related puns. Overall, I think everyone with young kids would enjoy adding this movie to their collection. To those complaining about similarities in the plot to the Incredibles, I didn't find any parallels, but even if there were similarities, I bet you didn't catch the parody of Iron Man towards the end of the movie. Most movies are repeats of others, so get over it and just enjoy the movie for what it is - a very funny movie that will appeal to all ages.",1295568000,6,979,4.4748603351955305

It was so much better than what you would expect upon seeing the advertisements. So if you had planned on not seeing the movie because of the advertisements or you just don't dig on ""kid movies"" I suggest you throw those thoughts out the window and watch the movie and judge for yourself. It has a lot of action, of course, but it also has a lot of heart. Plus, if you're a fan of excellent animation, MegaMind is above the curve in that department. Such expressive facial features and body movements, little details that would be easy to forget or overlook, you realize add so much richness to the experience. As for the storyline, it had a lot of heart. You feel for the characters. There's a realness to them! And the music! This movie has a phenomenal soundtrack. The music covers a range of music types from artists like Ozzy, AC/DC, Guns n' Roses, Michael Jackson, Elvis, ELO, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Minnie Riperton, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers. Plus, the original score is really really good too.

When I was sitting in the theatre, not knowing what to expect, hoping it would be good, anticipating it would be just another CG kids' movie, I discovered within the first 10 minutes or so that this movie was going to be good. I went back 4 additional times to see it in the theatre after that. I absolutely cannot get enough of this movie. So it being released with a bonus episode, that is just thrilling for me.

4203284,2,B003UESJF6,"I'm looking at some of these reviews right now, and wondering if Dreamworks paid some of these people here to write the reviews, because it seems I am in the minority yet again. :/

This film is 1/3 a great movie, 1/3 a decent flick that could make for at least a decent studio filler before Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda 2, and 1/3 a boring snoozefest that was deinitely not worth catching a 9 PM screening of. Maybe Dreamworks is starting to run out of original ideas- it seems to be their best animated stuff is adaptations- Shrek, How To Train Your Dragon, etc. Not to say I didn't like Monsters Vs. Aliens or Kung Fu Panda, but I feel as if when they derive, they are in their own little league.

I saw the trailer with Toy Story 3. It looked like a good movie- Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, etc. That, plus its concept of a deconstruction of superhero movie seemed funny, except I already saw that 3 months beforehand when I went and saw Despicable Me 3D. Nonetheless I chose to ignore the warning signs and went in.

The movie was working for 20 minutes. Especially in its opening scenes, with how we're introduced to how Megamind is apparently having the worst day of his life, as he is falling to his death. I will admit I laughed at the ""Aw, a baby! How flattering."" line, the childhood was cute, and I was just generally loving it.

Then the second act came, where Megamind was bored because he's officially defeated Metro Man and there's nothing to do. That's quite symbolic because not a lot happens (at least that I am able to remember for the life of me) happens in this period of time, except for Megamind posing as a janitor and falling in love with Tina Fey. This is where the film nearly made me fall asleep. At that point, I started worrying and kept thinking ""Who approved of this deft, uneven script?""

However, the last 10 minutes is where the film started to feel like it found its niche and at least passed for an entertaining action packed finale. It's like, there's a good 20 minutes of brilliance, an hour of boring filler, then 10 minutes of the brilliance that got the film off to a good start. As satisfied as I was that the film had a good last 10 minutes, 30 minutes out of 90 doesn't a good film make.

It just seems like Dreamworks thought that they hit their mark with the stellar How To Train Your Dragon, found Universal was producing Despicable Me while someone had The Incredibles playing in the background and thought ""OMG GUYS. UNIVERSAL HAS A SWEET CONCEPT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT AND RISE TO THEIR LEVEL OF BRILLANCE. OH AND LET'S BRING IN SOME STUFF FROM THE INCREDIBLES!!!"" I crap you not. I got reminded several times of Despicable Me and The Incredibles, which is not a good thing. It just shows that they felt like they needed more money, so after doing what was said above, they'd release it as a sort of filler flick for their paychecks before KFP2 came out. Because they've gotta keep bringing in bucks by the buckets somehow. It also doesn't help that the equally mediocre Shrek Forever After had the same feel, despite being better than Shrek 3.

To be fair, a lot of the movie has a ""going through the motions"" feel to it. It seems like the writers got really lazy halfway into writing and went, ""Hey, we released a real sleeper hit this year!!! No need to be creative or make sure people find the jokes funny, we can turn our grocery shopping lists into a 3D movie and it'd be a smash!!!"". None of the jokes seem fresh. The plot seems bored and done a million times before. It just feels done, and I could have spent my money elsewhere.

In short, Megamind is really just a boring movie, obviously released so Dreamworks can get more money. It just feels flat, tired, bored, done a million times before and even beautiful animation/good 3D cannot save this film from being the boring, convoluted mess it is. Skip it.

Well, Pixar, it's safe to say you don't have to worry about your jobs anymore.",1294358400,6,3968,4.409836065573771
4203285,5,B003UESJF6,"I've always loved Dreamworks Movies, with Monsters VS Aliens, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon being the best of the bunch. But Dreamworks has reached a new level of awesome with Megamind.

The movie is not only hilarious and entertaining, but it also has a lot of emotion. There are scenes where you really feel for the main character. You relate to him, everyone can relate to being pushed into becoming something you didn't want to be. All the characters are strong and not annoying at all. The action is superb, and I am so getting this on Blu-Ray because the animation is just great! You can tell Dreamworks has come a long way since Shrek. The relationship between Megamind and Roxanne (the female lead) is funny and sweet at the same time. I love everything about this movie, and I don't think I can find anything wrong with it if I tried. Critics may say it's predicable and cliched, but there are a few twists thrown in that even I didn't expect. This movie, like Megamind, is something special :)

The lesson ""Choose your own Destiny"" shines through in this movie, and it's great for both kids and adults. I would definitely by the Blu-Ray dvd (comes with a mini movie and a ton of extras) or at least buy the single disc. This movie is just great, and everyone who loves animated movies, superhero movies, or just loves having a good time will love this movie.

4203290,5,B003UESJF6,"Megamind is something of a mix, but a good one. On the one hand, it takes the existing traditional tropes of comic-book superhero and supervillain and works within them, but at the same time it ventures into territory that one rarely sees, going one step beyond the traditional to answer two questions: (1) What really makes a supervillain truly 'bad'? and (2) What happens when the supervillain unexpectedly wins?

The film starts off with a traditional hook - Megamind apparently falling to his doom - and then flashes back to the beginning, with the origins of the two classic protagonists, superhero Metro Man and supervillain Megamind, each sent out as an infant in a spacepod from their respective doomed homeworlds. From there, however, things begin to take a twist.  Megamind is the supervillain, but more from bad luck than anything else (Metro Man's pod lands in a mansion where he is adopted by rich parents who give him everything, Megamind's pod on the other hand lands in a penitentiary where he is adopted by the inmates).  Megamind doesn't become a supervillain so much out of evil as much as lack of options, his main talent apparently being wreaking havoc and scaring the hell out of people. He and Metro Man become enemies/rivals in a series of confrontations where, in Megminds own words ""Our battles quickly got more elaborate. He would win some, I would ALMOST win others!"".

And, in classic comic-book tradition, a plucky news reporter, Roxanne Ritchie, and her hapless and socially inept camerman, Hal Stewart, are always on the scene when one of Megamind's schemes unfolds, with the result that Roxanne gets abducted so many times that it becomes almost routine (""Alligators, yeah, mm-hmm. I was thinking about it on the way over..."").

But things take an unexpected twist when, in spite of all the glitches, Megamind's scheme actually works and Metro Man is apparently destroyed, leaving only a skeleton bearing his cape behind. At first Megamind is ecstatic, but after only a few days the supervillian finds himself at a loss as to what to do next.  What _does_ a supervillain do when he has no superhero to challenge or to be challenged by?

In his existiential angst, Megamind unexpectedly ends up talking to Roxanne, albeit disguised as Bernard, a museum attendent at the Metro Man Museum. From her, he gets the inspiration to create a new superhero to restore the balance in his life. Unfortunately his plan goes hideously awry when the recipient of his superhero formula turns out to be Hal, Roxanne's inept and all too flawed camerman.

And once again the story turns back to the question of just what makes a supervillain truly bad. Hal isn't evil per se, but he is lazy, petulant, completely self-centered and prone to tantrums when he doesn't get his way.  Highly destructive tantrums once he discovers that he, as the intended new superhero Titan, has powers that put him beyond anyone else's control. Jonah Hill as the voice of Hal/Titan manages to perfectly bring out these serious flaws in Titan's character that result in Titan becoming a far more menacing threat to society than the ostensibly 'evil' Megamind ever was.

Craftsmanship-wise, everything in Megamind works well. The animation is colorful and eye-catching, the character design superb, and the voice actors distinctive and entertaining (Will Ferrell as Megamind, Brad Pitt as Metro Man, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchie, Jonah Hill as Hal Stewart/Titan, and David Cross as Minion). There are also a lot of references and in-jokes worked in, some fairly obvious (Minion's exo-suit with the diving helmet head and gorilla-like body are a direct take from the classicly-bad scifi film Robot Monster) and fairly subtle (the museum attendant Bernard is voiced by Ben Stiller, who played a museum guard named Bernard in the two Night At The Museum movies).

Though the film was released at the theaters in 3D, you won't miss a thing seeing it on a DVD.  Quite frankly, the whole 3D thing is a waste in most movies that have come out with it and Megamind is no exception.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys good animation with entertaining characters and story.",1292025600,116,4161,4.944126074498567
4203291,5,B003UESJF6,"""Megamind"" is the story of good vs. evil - or is it?  The movie starts out with a very cute blue baby being sent to earth in a rocket by his parents to save the infant from the destruction of the planet. As the little blue child is rocketing toward earth, a another child (who is very handsome) is also heading toward earth in a similar rocket. Both children crash land on earth, but to different fates. The beautiful child crash lands on a big estate where he is adopted by a rich family and given everything. While the little blue child crash lands in a prison and is adopted by the prisoners who teach him the ways of evil. Both children are highly intelligent, but due to their circumstances, one grows up to be a superhero -Metroman (voiced by Brad Pitt) and the other a supervillain - Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell).

Metroman and Megamind spend their lives locked in the classic battle of good vs. evil with Megamind always losing and ending up in jail. Until one day, Megamind's evil strategy works and Metroman is destroyed. Megamind takes over Metro City and turns it into a dump yard. But he comes to realize that being evil is boring without someone good to fight against. The rest of the story is Megamind coming to terms with his real destiny and realizing that looks and circumstances don't always have to dictate your success in this life.

""Megamind"" is one of those animated movies that has a lot more going on than meets the eye.  The animation is totally brilliant.  The scenes look almost real and seeing the movie in 3D is a must if you want to get the best animated viewing experience.  The ending is exciting with complex animation that is out of this world.

The story is one of the most complex that I have seen in a children's film.  There are many twists and turns in the plot and, since I did not see the trailer, I did not see a lot of them coming.  But I find it rare in an animated film (and any movie where Will Ferrell is involved) to have such a rich storyline were good and evil are shown as shades of gray that can be affected by circumstances and our own choices in life.  Just because you are raised in a prison does not mean you have to be villain any more than being raised in a palace means you have to be a prince.

The kids in the audience loved the obvious jokes and slapstick comedy, but there were many funny one-liners where only parents were laughing since you had to have seen ""The Godfather"" to understand the comedy references.

What is it about Dreamworks' animated films? They just don't measure up. Which is a shame. They employ inventive stories, top-notch animation, yet they always seem to fall short.  When compared to Pixar and Disney offerings. Maybe they need to develop a reputation, a following for a particular kind of animation, much like Warner Bros. was known for creating some truly ""Looney Tunes"". Get it?.

I love animated films and see many every year. The best are always from Pixar; they always set and consistently raise the bar for all others combining brilliant animation, funny characters and superb storytelling. How often are you so moved by a sequence in an animated film that it brings you to tears? I can name a few from Pixar films. Disney is a fairly close second. The animation is beautiful (they created the feature length animated film and have a rich and bountiful history to draw from), the films are usually funny and the storytelling is good. Disney is best at adapting fairy tales, giving them a little spin, so they start off with some pretty good source material. Dreamworks is a distant third. The animation is always beautiful and rich, but they just aren't very funny. This is strange, surprising, and even maddening given the huge amount of comedic talent employed in their films. Also, they seem unable to capture the same depth of detail Pixar brings to their films. Perhaps this is why Dreamworks seems all over the map; they change animation and narrative styles with each new film, something Pixar also does. But Pixar has mastered this. Dreamworks hasn't.

""Shrek"" really established Dreamworks as a possible contender to the animation throne. Based on a children's book, the character and subject matter allow the filmnmakers to take pot shots at everything that makes Disney Disney. Add incredible voice talent from Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas and John Lithgow and you have the makings of a huge hit. Because of the success of this film, Dreamworks has since made three sequels, continuing the story of the popular ogre and delivering films with wildly differing results. What ""Shrek"" also did was establish the prescedent o using established film actors as voice talent in animated films. This was something Robin Williams proved could work, but the studios were reluctant to part with so much money sticking primarily with television, Broadway and undiscovered talent. But ""Shrek"" made it a reality. Now, every Dreamworks film boasts big name talent with mixed results. Will Smith, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Reese Witherspoon, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Anjelina Jolie continue to lend their talents to various projects.

The reason I continue to go to these films? The animation is usually pretty beautiful. ""King Fu Panda"" was one of the most beautlfully animated films I have ever seen. But it isn't very funny.

Now, we have ""Megamind"" starring Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey and Jonah Hill. Again, great to look at and fun to watch in 3-D, but surprisingly few laughs. Also it seems a little too close to the superb ""The Incredibles"", knocking it down a few points for originality.

Megamind (Ferrell) and Metro Man (Pitt) have been rivals since they first arrived on this planet as babies. Megamind spends his every waking moment trying to figure out how to escape prison and finally out do his nemesis, Metro Man. His plans usually involve some sort of elaborate contraption in his lair, with many of the details set forth by his minion (David Cross). But Metro City (pronounced very differently with great comedic effect by the villain) loves Metro Man and his seems to thrive on the adulation. Roxanne Richie (Fey), a local news reporter, always seems to get caught in the middle of the tug of war, spending time as the bait in Megamind's plan. One day, Megamind surprises everyone and beats his rival. But he becomes bored and decides to create a new hero, Tighten, fashioning his new nemesis from Hal (Hill), Richie's cameramen. But Hal likes his new powers too much and becomes bored being a hero, so he starts to wreak havoc on Metro City. Who will save the day? Megamind soon realizes he has to step in and set things right.

Directed by Tom McGrath (""Madagascar"" and its sequel), ""Megamind"" is fun to watch, especially in 3-D, but it isn't very memorable.

Ferrell does an interesting job of bringing the alien orphan to life, narrating the life story of both he and Metro Man and bringing us up to speed. His character is more amusing than funny. He frequently mispronounces words and his ""diabolical"" plans are engaging and fun to watch. Pitt is also good as Metro Man, the super hero who does good things, but his ego is also clearly something that needs to be fed. Luckily, the people of Metro City are only too glad to feed it, heaping adulation on him. Tina Fey is fun as the street wise reporter who isn't really afraid of Megamind, she has been his captive too often and Metro Man always saves her.

But when Megamind begins to groom Hal to become the new superhero, Tighten becomes a little too similar to Syndrome, the character played by Jason Lee in ""The Incredibles"". Once this happens, you start to see other similarities and the new Dreamworks production feels a bit like a retread.

All animated features are now being produced and released in 3-D. The extra money is too lucrative to the theaters and the studios, and these extra few dollars per ticket helped make ""Toy Story 3"" the #1 animated film of all time. And I like watching these films in 3-D, even when it doesn't really seem necessary. The 3-D adds a layer of texture to the universe created by the filmmakers. Thankfully, in a Pixar film, you embrace this extra level of detail because the tapestry is so beautiful to begin with. It isn't necessary to have things flying at your face to take advantage of the 3-D process. In ""Megamind"", they go the same route. It seems to add another texture to the story and little else. It doesn't even really seem to enhance all of the flying sequences.

The story also seems to meander a bit. When Megamind becomes bored, he takes on another persona and... Well, I'll stop before I reveal too much but this part seems a bit slow.

""Megamind"" is a wash. Not memorable or funny enough to make it a family classic which is a shame because the animation is good.

I think Dreamworks needs to rethink their strategy. Come up with a consistent type of story and animation. One moment, we have the stylized retro characterizations of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the next, we have the almost painterly backdrops of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and gorgeous animation that almost looks hand drawn. First ""Shrek"", featuring computer generated characters taking aim at the fairy tales of the most famous Disney features, then we have ""Over the Hedge"", a cutesy animated film based on a popular newspaper comic strip. If they were to develop a particular style, it might help them strive to make it the best and to make the best films. As it stands, they seem like they are all over the place.

And ""Megamind"" rests firmly in the middle.",1291420800,,7086,4.77859477124183
4203294,4,B003UESJF6,"I'm not gonna say this is one of the best superhero movies of all time, although it just may be, but I will say that what MEGAMIND does, changes the game for future superhero movies. While Spiderman 3 spent most of its time in restaurants, cooking dinners and talking about romance, MEGAMIND spent its time flying, soaring and dazzling with amazing 3D effects that give the city depth and give the audience a true and awe-inspiring feeling of actually FLYING.

Future live-action superhero movies are gonna have to up-the-anty sometime REAL SOON. Iron Man 2, had surprisingly little action and shot all of its action load in 2 very well done scenes. Yet, for the rest of the film, Iron Man's costume was locked away in Stark's lab while he struggled with depression because he was dieing, mulled over his childhood and shot fruit in a drunken stooper.

MEGAMIND is always interesting and always moving and able to do things that most superhero movies can't. Not to mention, after viewing it in 3D, any superhero movie in the future, that involves flying and isn't in 3D, is dropping the ball.

MEGAMIND has personality, emotion, laughs, action and TWISTS and turns that I found refreshing in a 'so-called' kids movie. If there is such a thing anymore. Because this movie and many like it, aren't just for kids anymore. MEGAMIND is a true pleasure on all levels and will be enjoyable for all ages for a long time.",1291075200,11,1412,4.708502024291498
4203295,4,B003UESJF6,"I am so glad that animated movies are coming back into their own. In the past few years we've seen some really good ones like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon and now we have Megamind. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. The dialogue and characterization are strong too.

  It is, of course, the thinly disguised story of Superman, but told from his arch enemie's(Lex Luthor) point of view. It's also a look at what happens when society fails a child who just doesn't fit neatly into a pigeon hole. Because Megamind is different than his peers(because of his looks and intelligence) he relates to them a bit awkwardly which in turn makes him feel even more different and alienated. At some point he reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, that he might as well be a bad kid, and  "" MegaMind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy! "" was born.

 Megamind is also pretty even handed. When characters in this movie are bad,or cowardly, or act in ways that are beneath them, it's for an understandable human reason. I think the movie makes the arguement that if people could reach a more mutual understanding of each other, then we might be able to start to eliminate much(but not all) of the evil and misery in this world. It has real heart

  That's just the underlying philosphy though. It's nowhere nearly as preachy as I might be making it sound.  The movie is peppered with cool regferences to various Superman incarnations and plenty of humor. The animation is fantastic, especially Megamind's ""Death Blimp"". I saw it for the first time with a huge audience which connsisted of both older animation fans and young families and everyone had a great time. I looked around occassioanlly and saw people of every description laughing through out the movie. There is something for eveyone to enjoy in Megamind. It's a guaranteed good time for anyone with a heart beat.(Honestly, even the undead would probably crack a smile here and there.)",1289865600,6,2097,4.643243243243243
4203296,5,B003UESJF6,"After some waivering, I decided to see Megamind 3D.  I'm a big fan of 3D, and the 3D is done very well.  There is no reason to see the 2d version when the 3D is available.

As I said the movie is funny, but not by telling jokes. It's funny in a real way, generally done via sarcasm, goofy grammar usage, and self-deprecation.  The plot is a nice change from the typical hero/villain plot, and will keep you interested!

The biggest thing that not many people are mentioning is how brilliantly done the animation is.  The images, and scenery are so crisp and vivid, it really is mind blowing.  Paired with the 3D effects, this is a visually stunning movie.

I regret waivering on this movie. I almost didn't even bother with it.  I'm glad I listened to the good reviews, and took the plunge. It was worth every penny, and every minute spent.

Dreamworks is on a roll.",1289520000,13,866,4.389937106918239
4203297,5,B003UESJF6,"This movie is perfect for the whole family. It's hilarious and has a heart-warming storyline. Will Ferrell was awesome as Megamind, the villian and Metro Man's archenemy. On the day Metro Man is being honored by the city, Megamind breaks out of jail with the help of a talking fish named Minion and kidnaps Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind finally defeats Metro Man and takes over the city. Over time, Megamind grows bored and wants an enemy to fight. He creates a serum of Metro Man's DNA in order to create a superhero, but along the way, he disguises himself as a museum curator named Bernard and starts to fall in love with Roxanne.  After he accidentally turns Roxanne's cameraman, Hal into a hero, he uses his power for evil. Megamind must stop him, save the girl, and become the hero himself. I highly recommend MEGAMIND!!!",1289347200,6,822,4.708333333333333
4203298,4,B003UESJF6,"Part of what makes ""Megamind"" so enjoyable is that it's both an homage to and a parody of ""Superman."" In this version, not one but two doomed planets send a newborn son to Earth. One can fly, has super strength and suave good looks, and, after his pod crash lands on the property of a wealthy couple, is destined to become a superhero. The other has blue skin, a bulbous head, a fish-like minion encased in a glass ball, and, after his pod crash lands within the confines of a prison, is destined to become a villain. We follow this villain, who has called himself Megamind, as he gradually realizes that maybe - just maybe - there's more to him than merely being bad. Perhaps it was merely a phase, an unhealthy outlet for his jealously at being teased and neglected during his formative years.

This may not be the most original computer animated film of our time, but it certainly is one of the most compelling. It's also one of the funniest; I think I laughed harder during ""Megamind"" than during any animated film released this year, and this includes highly enjoyable fair such as ""Toy Story 3,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" and ""Despicable Me."" It follows in the footsteps of most new releases, both animated and live action, by being released in 3D. While I still feel that the process is overhyped, overused, and overrated, there are select moments when it proves itself adequate (it so rarely makes a movie great). ""Megamind"" is a perfectly adequate 3D film; I can't say that I felt completely immersed, but I certainly enjoyed gawking at the action, the textures, and the shapes. That being said, all that would have just fine to look at in 2D, so if you have the choice, save yourself the extra cash - and yet another pair of 3D glasses.

And now for the plot. Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) has for years been the archenemy of Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt), a goody-two-shoes Superman caricature who defends the citizens of Metro City. Despite being well-crafted, Megamind's evil schemes have all been foiled, and by now, it has gotten to the point that they no longer carry any weight - least of all for Metro City's star news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey), who has been kidnapped by Megamind more times than she can remember.

On the day a museum opens in honor of Metro Man, Megamind appears to achieve the impossible by defeating his rival and taking control of the city. He's happy about this, but only at first; after a while, it seems that, without a hero to battle against, his life has absolutely no meaning. Using technology of his own invention, he creates a new adversary, hoping it will help him relive his glory days as a criminal mastermind. Here enters Roxanne's cameraman, Hal Stewart (voiced by Jonah Hill), who's transformed from a pudgy computer nerd into a muscular superhero named Tighten (apparently a spoof of the word ""titan""). Hal hopes to use his new abilities to woo Roxanne, who he has always had a crush on. Unfortunately, Roxanne is already dating someone else, and of that, I will say no more.

In due time, Tighten devolves into Metro City's newest enemy. With Metro Man out of the picture, it seems the only hero the city has left is Megamind. Does he have it in him to be a defender of the people? The answer lies in a strange but appropriate skewing of a line Aaron Eckhart delivered in ""The Dark Knight"": ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""

It's practically a guarantee that children will enjoy this movie. It has a lot of action, the sight gags are plentiful, the colors are bright, the 3D is noticeable, and some of the dialogue is just silly enough to hold their attention. But adults will enjoy this movie, too. One of the funniest subplots involves Megamind's ability to disguise himself with a series of holographic projections, controlled by a wristwatch-like mechanism; as he trains Hal into becoming a superhero, he transforms himself in a short, stocky send-up of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, complete with a hilariously pronounced lisp. I also enjoyed the parody of Shepard Fairey's ""Hope"" poster, made famous during Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Let's just say that the phrase, ""Yes, We Can,"" no longer applies.

This is, in short, a highly enjoyable animated comedy that everyone will enjoy. There is, in fact, only one thing about ""Megamind"" I took issue with: A brief but disturbing shot of Metro Man juggling three babies before tossing them back to their star-struck mothers. One of them lands in his mother's arms upside down. Even within the context of a family-friendly cartoon, this pushes the limits of what is and isn't acceptable. Fortunately, the scene is saved when, immediately afterwards, Metro Man casually walks on water. I may be reaching too far, but this could be yet another reference to ""Superman,"" which was in part a biblical allusion to God sending Jesus to Earth for the benefit of mankind. The difference, of course, is that neither Jesus nor Superman would ever shout out, ""And I love you, random citizen!""",1289260800,4,5062,4.707674943566591
