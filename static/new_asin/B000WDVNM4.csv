8222820,4,B000WDVNM4,"'On Bloody Sunday' starts off with a teenage girl telling her mother about the plans she has for that night.
  What follows is a flashback from her mother's past.
  It involves Myspace and teens who vanish.
  The acting is top-notch and professional. I was especially impressed by the lead actress. Her character doesn't give off fake vibes and helps draw the viewers into the story.
  The story itself is very original and the ending is amazing.
  It isn't the most well-known film,but it deserves to be!",1198281600,6,505,4.767441860465116
