3171854,5,B0017HYR36,"I am someone who has no patience to follow a television series week after week waiting to see what is going to happen next.  So this DVD bundle of Grey's Anatomy from season one to three served me well.

I had weeks of true enjoyment as I followed and witnessed the lives of struggling interns become doctors, doctors struggling to make interns become good doctors and the wonderful humor and wit that was maintained throughout the three seasons.

The many hours of bonus features such as extended episodes, uncut scenes, behind the scenes, and interviews add much pleasure to an already very pleasurable experience.

$79.99 for three seasons of Grey's Anatomy, this bundle of DVDs is definitely worth getting!

So my advice......Just Get It!!!",1218844800,,744,4.967741935483871

3171859,5,B0017HYR36,"Grey's Anantomy is always superb! No matter how many times I watch it, the Drama is outstanding. I laugh, I cry, I really feel the characters lives. Can't wait for season 4!",1212364800,,173,4.4375
3171860,5,B0017HYR36,"Since episode #1- who has not fallen in love with the group of interns and all the antics they get up to? Meredith, Christina, Izzy and George have far much more to worry about than completing their residency at Seattle Grace Hospital- they have to survive life first. Love, friendship and Dr MacDreamy of course make it all so much more interesting. Also- do not forget the Nazi!!!
This 3 season bundle is a must have for any individual that enjoys quality television or is an addict to Grey's already. Do not let this change past you by to own a piece of television history!",1211328000,,576,4.495238095238095
3171861,5,B0017HYR36,"All three seasons rock! Got interested in the show in the middle of third season, went on to purchase the set and they are all great. All the characters and the storyline are good. Should check it out!",1207440000,,201,4.315789473684211
3171862,3,B0017HYR36,"Set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, this hit series portrays the lives of five interns as they struggle with the personal and professional challenges of becoming surgeons. Seasons One and Two start the show off quickly, with one gripping physical and emotional challenge followed by another. The dialogue is witty, the acting is terrific. The drama is intense, as the eponymous heroine falls in love with the magnetic Dr. Derek Shepherd, world-famous neurosurgeon. So handsome is he that the female interns nickname him Dr. McDreamy, and indeed the chemistry between Ellen Pompeo (who plays Grey) and Patrick Dempsey (who plays Shepherd) is explosive. Only slightly less compelling is the complex and unlikely pairing up of the perfectionist, driven Cristina Yang and the precise and demanding cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke.

There is no denying that ""Grey's Anatomy"" is entertaining, though it becomes less so as the episodes lumber on, and the show grows more and more mindlessly repetitive. Jokes about ""McDreamy,"" the perfect ""McLife,"" etc. wear increasingly thin; even the characters appear uncomfortable making them. And since, basically, the show offers five ""eligible"" male characters and five ""eligible"" female characters, only so many permutations are possible, no matter how much time the randy couples spend necking in the ""on call"" room and whisking each other into the broom closets for a quickie. Of course, doctors don't just date doctors; they can fall in love with patients (and vice versa), which happens too. But the basic plot structure -- girl meets boy, is drawn into taboo relationship, blissful happiness, affair goes public, problems ensue -- just grinds around again and again. Sex between interns and patients or ""attendings"" (as they are called) hardly feels taboo anymore -- not to mention that it's hard to understand how any medicine gets practiced in these circumstances.

I'm sure I'll never feel the same about going to the hospital again! ""Grey's Anatomy"" is certainly a cautionary tale in that respect. It seems that one should probably avoid doctors altogether as just about every person related to or involved with one of these practictioners (even one poor fellow who ends up on on the wrong end of a one-night-stand) requires medical treatment (and in several cases succumbs to the illness). Heart attacks, Alzheimer's, Esophageal herniation, drowning, prolonged erections: These are just a few of the maladies that afflict the medically connected. Better to stay away from doctors altogether!

But not to worry: If you have an in with the doctor you will definitely get lots of attention -- It turns out that doctors spend about fifty or a hundred times longer and work thousands of times harder on those to whom they are intimately linked than they do on the average sorry patient, who is forced to sit passively and witness to nauseatingly intimate and inappropriate flirations between barely qualifed interns who have little interest in curing them but just want to participate (when they are not having sex) in freakish surgeries. The freakier the better -- Who can forget their glee at the woman with two uteruses, or the adult conjoined twins who are (no surprise here!) both in love with the same woman. There are plenty of bizarre medical conditions on any given day at Seattle Grace, especially of a sexual nature (for example, the adulterous couple who got stuck together ""in flagrante delicto""). Nothing to be embarraassed about, though. ""They're doctors, they've seen everything,"" remarks a patient who has just put a fork in his wife's neck when she was performing um...

Yes, not only have they seen everything, they've done it. Only in the end the everything turns out to be just the same thing: over and over again.",1202342400,9,3793,5.132686084142395
