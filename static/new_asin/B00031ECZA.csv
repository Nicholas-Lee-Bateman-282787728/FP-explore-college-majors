8035868,5,B00031ECZA,"I am writing this review just to set the record straight.  This is no bootleg release.  It is just from another country and it was released worldwide decades ago as ""12 Wasted Years"" on VHS.  The picture quality and audio are fine, may not be 5.1 or whatever is the current trend to have but this is something that will never see the light of day in America on dvd.  So if you want it, you have to get it elsewhere or snag a copy on Amazon.  If your are a true Iron Maiden fan, you have already bought this on  VHS in the mid-80's, this is just released now on dvd from Brazil I think.  Some rare clips and a very good documentary for the time when the band was at it's peak.  I recommend the program on dvd or VHS, just don't listen to someone say this is a ""waste of money"" or some other type of garbage that the band didn't authorize.  That statement is pure rubbish.  I have been a Maiden fan since Killers and this is a good 90 minute show!",1152576000,9,945,4.032258064516129
8035869,1,B00031ECZA,"This is not an authorized Iron Maiden DVD.

This was a documentary released back when maiden was on the World Slavery Tour. They had just played some historic gigs ""behind the iron curtain"". The documentary was great, this DVD is not.

The production is horrible. Don't waste your money.

For any authorized DVD release from the band, check out their web site. More over, Rod Smallwood and Steve Harris have repeatedly warned fans about boot leg garbage like this.

I believe the band has plans to release their entire back catalog of videos onto DVD, so again, don't waste your money on this junk, and wait for the real thing from the band.

Up The Irons!",1116547200,4,656,4.620689655172414
8035870,5,B00031ECZA,"Maidens kicked my azz since the '80s. This dvd has some HOME VIDEO footage of there earlier days. Some stuff you WON""T see elsewhere. It's not BAD QUALITY. It's just got a little bit of home video. Home video that IRON MAIDEN taped. How cool is that?? REALLY?? If Bruce and the boys have you wanting to run to the hills, then this video is a must have. I've watched it a hundred times and still love it. Thanx, Ancient Mariner.",1107129600,4,427,4.283950617283951
8035871,1,B00031ECZA,"This is not authorised by the band therefore the quality is terrible.

You are better off waiting for the re-issues that are on there way!!!",1095811200,9,140,4.6
8035872,5,B00031ECZA,"This was released in 1987, just after the Somewhere in Time album.  So all of the information is somewhat dated, however, this is by far and away the best video Maiden has ever produced.  If you just liked Maiden and didn't know too much about them, or you hate reading books and want to know about Maiden's history, this is THE video.  Rare footage from early gigs at the Ruskin Arms and The Marquee.  Interviews with all band memebers and some even ex-singer Paul Di'Anno.  Early concert footage from Beast on the Road tour, World Peace tour and World Slavery tour.  A small snipit from Somewhere on Tour.  A very rare video of ""Women in Uniform"", the first Maiden single. Tons of inverviews with road crew, managers, and club owners.  You can't find a more difintive Maiden docu anywhere.  I was lucky enough to buy it when it first came out in '87, and now it's out of print.  If you get the chance to get a copy,
GRAB IT!!!",1003795200,7,928,4.405882352941177
8035873,5,B00031ECZA,"This video is exiting to watch, you would never get bored with it. Some things that are totally over the top is listening to the interviews of each member. Steve talks more than Bruce, Dave, Adrian & Nicko. Steve  basically discusses what happened in Maiden's early days, how a record  company got interested in them, going up to Cambridge & recording I  think 4 songs Maiden had arranged, about getting snowed in with no place to  stay while they were in Cambridge. When Adrian joined, Steve said Adrian  couldn't decide whether to join or not, so Steve said ""well we've  decided for you, you're in"". Dave talks about playing at the Marquee  Club in England seeing the crowds reaction when Maiden were performing.  Bruce discusses his interview with Rod Smallwood. Adrian  talks about him  & Dave playing together in bands before they joined Maiden. And Nicko  talks about how he first got started with Maiden. Of course, a lot of their  road crew is interesting to listen to their stories. One of them talks  about how the song The Number of the Beast came about. And needless to say,  Maiden's songs are their best, performances are fabulous. The Number of the  Beast, Running Free & The Trooper come from Live After Death. Wasted  Years show the members goofing around playing different instruments, except  Adrian. It's definately a video to add excitement in the Iron Maiden  Archives. But, when you think about it, Iron Maiden adds excitement anytime  they step on the stage, being interviewed or whatever is taking place.",939686400,6,1529,4.833976833976834
