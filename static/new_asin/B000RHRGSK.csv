2867354,5,B000RHRGSK,"This was a wonderful story about two children (Jorito and Malu), who run away from home in search of Malu's father because her mother wants to take her out of Cuba. They run into several funny adventures, and I just found the entire movie to be very heartwarming. The children are filled with such passion for their country and their friendship. And despite the mothers differences, they discover a common bond of finding their children. A powerful ending to this story awaits the viewer.

I enjoyed these young stars, I believe this is the first movie for Malu and I purchased Al Otro Lado to see Jorge again.",1220659200,12,610,4.648148148148148
2867355,5,B000RHRGSK,"This lovely film will make you happy to be alive and, if you are Cuban, proud of your country and its people. It is also proof that, despite cultural or political differences, we are all members of the human family. Do not miss.",1214179200,7,228,4.325581395348837
2867356,5,B000RHRGSK,"This is one of the best films to come out of Cuba in a long time. The acting by the two young artists, Tarrau Broche and Milo Avila, is truly amazing. The music is superb and the scenery ratifies the exclamation of Christopher Columbus when he landed in Cuba: ""The most beautiful land man has ever seen."" Truly a work of art by director Juan Carlos Cremata. BRAVO! Rent it or buy it; you will not be disappointed.",1201737600,41,413,4.3076923076923075
2867357,5,B000RHRGSK,"Having never even read a review, we rented this film. It was wonderfully done , full of Cuba images and culture. The story centers around 2 children and their love and friendship. The adults play a smaller role but still strongly projected by the director. In a moment of desperation the two children run away as the adults around them do not acknowledge them. They do not feel that they have a choice but to flee to resolve the situation. Wonderful scenes of Cuba...amazing really!
I cried and laugh and caught a simple film full of heart and culture!",1199491200,48,552,4.585858585858586

2867395,3,B000RHRGSK,"Like many Cuban movies, virtuosity and almost mannerism in the images, which are superb. But the content is somewhat empty (is this due to the censorship?), and the story somewhat unrealistic.

2867398,4,B000RHRGSK,"If you want to understand the situation in Cuba at present, this film seems to sum up both sides: those who come to ""Yuma"" (the US) and those who are dedicated revolutionaries. The main actors are two fifth graders,a boy and a girl.",1354838400,,232,4.4186046511627906

2867401,4,B000RHRGSK,We showed this film for our Spanish club movie night at our college and it got rave reviews from young adults from age 18 all the way up to the non-traditional older students. It is a touching film about listening to your children and the language is reasonably clean in the show too. Lots of humour and drama. Money well spent! You will not regret getting this film for your own collection or if you teach high school or junior college.,1336262400,3,437,4.407407407407407

I have no issues at all and I recommend this video, talk about the reality that is lived in Cuba and the constrain of the population.

2867407,5,B000RHRGSK,"I first watched this movie online then purchased the dvd.  I found the lack of political dogma to be refreshing and the children's story enchanting.  Jorgito and Malu are neighbors who play together despite their parents' orders to stay away from each other.  They are friends at school and walk home together everyday.  When Malu's grandmother dies, her mother is free to leave Cuba thus triggering the children's journey to the end of the island in search of Malu's father.  The music is beautiful as is the scenery - I would recommend that you watch it for those two reasons alone.  However, the performances of the two child actors is what makes the story come alive.  They are natural and not only representative of children everywhere, but also of Cubans in general - a little loud, a little in your face, always charming.  I am confused however by the reviewers who found it offensive because the children were seen in underwear and sitting on a toilet.  The scenes were innocent as was the relationship between Jorgito and Malu.  And regarding the ending, the impression I was left with was that the children were not going to let themselves be seperated - not that they were about to commit suicide.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys foreign movies.",1320537600,3,1275,4.75
2867408,5,B000RHRGSK,"This film is excellent.  It's an excellent story; the characters are real,understandable, and admirable.  The strength of the bond between the two young people is something  we all need to  experience.",1316390400,,201,5.387096774193548
2867409,1,B000RHRGSK,"This movie is absolutely horrible! It's not fit for young or old. It's full of profanity and it even shows the children sitting on the toilet. I purchased it because of a review that read, ""I have difficulty finding movies I can show because so many are R rated. This one is wonderful. I highly recommend it for any Spanish class."" NONSENSE. I also purchased it for my Spanish class students and do not recommend it to parents or teachers. I watched it last night with my family for the first time and my youngest son had nightmares because of a frightening scene. I turned the movie off just before the young actors commit suicide. I would return it if I could, but once the videos are opened they may not be returned. So, I simply cut it in half with a pair of scissors.

I would suggest you see it and show it. The images are beautiful and it explains the problem of leaving your friends and family when you are 10 yrs old. You don't think about the future. Very little bad language and no images that you can't show. It is a story about friendship and you can have students have a discussion about friendship.

Traveling across the island they connect with a few unexpected characters.  In the mean time, both mothers are nervous wrecks.  In the beginning of the film, the mothers were very rude to each other, but when their children disappear, they become friends again.  Some may see this as a Capulet v.

2867413,5,B000RHRGSK,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, which I rented from our local library. It is not about politics at all, and it focuses on the friendship of a young boy and girl. The plot is basically that the girl's mother is going to marry a foreigner and move to the USA, but she wants to stay in Cuba with her friends. Her mother has to get a note signed by the father allowing them to move abroad. The girl undertakes a trip with her friend across the island country to get to the father before the letter arrives, so she can ask him not to sign the letter. I enjoyed the scenery and how this film shows that all children pretty much act the same, regardless of politics or nationality. It is a very funny film, especially when it shows how the children have to cope with trying to find food so that they can complete their journey. I highly recommend this film to anyone. Put your political hang-ups aside, and just enjoy this film.",1253404800,12,930,4.2897727272727275

In turn, she took me to watch the SF International Film Festival and Viva Cuba was one the films we watched.  I only read the blurb about the movie in the program but otherwise did not know what to expect.

I was stunned by the story of the two young kids who strove to preserve their friendship despite the many challenges that they faced.  However, the one that that stood out was the ending of the movie.  Without giving anytime away, the ending was ambiguous yet appropriate.  The two young kids were determined to remain friends forever.

The acting by the children is top-rate.  They effectively demonstrate the innocent moments of childhood, the pain at being unrecognized by adults, the quick swings from friends to enemies.

As they travel across the country, viewers take in vivid scenes of beaches, forests and towns.

A beautiful story about a friendship, childhood and life in Cuba, this is well worth watching.",1240358400,12,652,5.113207547169812
2867417,5,B000RHRGSK,"Malu and Jorgito were close friends despite their economical and political backgrounds. Malu's mother and Jorgito's mother were not on friendly terms becuase of their social and political differences. Malu's mother wanted her daughter to associate with people who were more upwardly mobile. She went through great lengths to ensure that her daughter would grow up to be a mature, young lady--English class, ballet, and piano. Jorgito's parents, although married, have marital problems. Jorgito's father is kept away from the family because of his job. And to make matters worse, he beats on his son to get him to be more masculine.
When Malu's grandmother dies, her mother is ready to get out of Cuba and start anew in another country. All she has to do is get her ex-husband to sign the permit to leave the country. Malu is saddened by this because she doesn't want to leave her friends and Jorge behind. Malu has to find her father so he won't sign the permit to leave the country.
Jorge and Malu go on a journey to find her father. Their relationship is tested when they visit various places and meet different people. They are determined to find Malu's father and stay together. Back home, the mothers, in their frantic state, have yet to find common ground and see that their children are compatible for each other.
This movie is great for all ages because it reveals the boundaries of friendship and what it means to be a child in a country that is strifed with political issues. Cuba is a beautiful country because the people make it a beautiful country.",1238630400,15,1561,4.742647058823529

I also experienced the sound being so delayed that peoples' mouths moved and no speech was heard until after another scene was already on screen. It made it impossible to watch and understand.
