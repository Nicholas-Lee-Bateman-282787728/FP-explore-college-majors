862058,4,6304406134,"I agree that Dole's absence is curious, and if done for political reasons, unpleasant. However, Dole apparently joined 10th Mountain in Feb. 1945 and didn't undergo the training in the Colorado Rockies that most of this film is focused on ([...] That might be why the movie didn't interview him -- only talking with either the filmmakers or Dole himself will settle the question.

Anyhow, about the movie -- it's good enough, I suppose. The use of a harmonica during some of the narration is hokey, but tolerable. I wish there was more discussion of how all that training specifically came in handy; I wish there were more war stories here period. Otherwise the film just comes across as a bunch of guys having fun until late in the war, while other soldiers are fighting and dying.",1199923200,,782,4.708029197080292
862059,4,6304406134,"I just finished seeing this film that I got from Amazon and it has everything good mentioned in the other reviews (professional and customer), but when it comes to listing the post war accomplishments of 10th Mountain Division members (which were considerable), it leaves out 10th Mountain member Sen. Bob Dole, a man who went on to become Majority and Minority Leader of the US Senate. This is an outrage. Guys who founded ski resorts and the Sierra Club are worthy of mention, but a US Senate leader who overcame years of rehabilitation from his WWII wounds (he still doesn't have use of one arm) is not deamed worthy of mention by the artsy types who made this film. Could he have been left out because he is a Republican? I bet if Bob Dole were a Democrat leader in the Senate, that would have been featured prominantly in this film that won a prize at the Sundance Festival.

Leaving Bob Dole out this film is an outrage and a testament to the mean spiritedness of the ""tolerant"" Hollywood elites. It also is a ""1984"" or Soviet style attempt to rewrite History. The ""artists"" should be ashamed of themselves.",1099094400,12,1113,4.592964824120603
862060,5,6304406134,"An excellent documentary of the WWII Tenth Mountain Division, the only US  troops ever trained for mountain battles.  Sort of an outdoorsy version of  Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation.  The division proved an irresistable  opportunity to the best skiers, climbers and outdoorsmen of the day who  wanted to both pursue their avocations as well as serve their country.  The  film provides an entertaining look into the training methods and battles of  the division.  But the most interesting part of the story of the tenth  division is the significance of the post-war contributions of its members  in fields such as sports business and environmentalism.  The surviving  members, all well into their seventies and eighties, still hold an annual  reunion to climb, hike, ski and reminisce about their fallen comrades.  In  one incredibly moving segment, the film documents one recent reunion where  the members held a joint climb with members of a similar club of Italian  veterans on the mountain that was the sight of their greatest battle.
Anyone should find this video entertaining, but outdoor enthusiasts  should find it particularly enjoyable.  These men are admirable to me for  their skill and dedication in the outdoors in an era before such activites  became fashionable; add in their sense of duty and honor as well as their  eloquence and I find them to be true heroes.  I thank the producers of this  film for introducing them to me",931564800,34,1448,5.05531914893617

These brave men were instrumental in the battle to take back Italy from the Nazis.  They were not only brave soldiers, but
great outdoorsmen.  This movie is shown in the ski museum in Vail Colorado and sells for $40.  I was extremely pleased to find it used for $18.  It was a gfit for my friend who has been on the ski patrol for many years.. The men of the 10th mountain patrol started the National Ski Patrol that still patrols ski resorts in this country.  Very good historical documentary.",1360713600,,632,4.313559322033898
862216,4,6304406134,"My son joined the Army a few months ago and has been assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain.  It was very interesting to see the origins of his unit, and why they stilll wear the ""Mountain"" strip above the division patch.

This was a proud unit, built up from people with specific skills for a specific objective.  I would have liked to see more about the postwar activities.  I did find the short film about the 10th Mountain in the 21st century very interesting.  After I got over initially being scared and worried for my son, I enjoyed being able to learn more about his unit.",1325894400,,602,4.387387387387387

7870025,5,6304406134,"Review of ""Climb to Conquer"", ""The Last Ridge"" and ""Fire on the Mountain (film)"". Amazing story of skiers and mountaineers and how they came together to lead some of the final battles of WW II in Italy. Their post WW II experiences however are almost more amazing as so many of the leaders of the 10th Mt Division evolved into creating the downhill ski industry in North America, mountaineering and training in outdoor skills. The father of one of my fellow graduate students years ago was in the 10th Mt Division and I remember stories he told me of his Dad's founding role in a ski area in New Hampshire. I felt a strong connection to the men of the 10th Mt Division as I personally became involved in the post WW II evolution of skiing, mountaineering, backpacking and outdoor adventures in the early 1960s and 1970s. Activities I continue to this day as I enter my seventh decade. Highly recommend this 1995 documentary about the 10th Mt Division.",1519776000,,951,4.633136094674557

Only wish my first husband, Neil Robinson, Sr (who died in 1975 of a brain tumor)  had been alive and able to be interviewed as a former trainer of the 87th > 10th Mt ski troops when this film was produced.  Since he broke an ankle skiing for a Warner Bros. promotional film during the training period at Camp Hale, the 10th Mt troops left for Europe without him; on recovery, he served in the Pacific as a medical-surgical tech for the balance of WWII. He enjoyed many memories of his time at Camp Hale! Neil was the first American ski pro to be Eastern-certified following WWII, and also held instructor licenses from Canada and Norway.  Like many other early New England skiers (racers and pros), on return from the war he helped develop ski schools and train future ski school directors who became legendary, like him, nationwide.  He also served for many years as a ""Senior Examiner"" of the Eastern Certification Committee and was a charter member of the PSIA.  As a member of Howard Head's Advisory Committee, Neil assisted Howard  from the late 1940s - thru 1960's in the design/development of various Head Ski models, starred in 1950's-60's Bromley Ski Area promo films, was featured in Look and Life Magazine full-page product ads, starred in the mid-'60s Vitalis ""ski hero"" ads on TV, skied on film for John Jay, Warren Miller, Jim Farnsworth and others and was often a featured guest on the Captain Kangaroo TV show.  He remained a close friend of numerous surviving 10th Mt. ski professionals, and has been memorialized in Vermont's Ski Hall of Fame.
