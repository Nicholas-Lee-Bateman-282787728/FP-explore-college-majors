5971862,5,B00F9HUQQM,My favorite new series on Television. (yes I still consider it new even though it's been on for 3 years) I had to have the seasons as soon as they were released and have already purchased Season 3 as well.,1414800000,,205,4.15

5971865,5,B00F9HUQQM,I love my seasons 1 and 2 of Grimm. I let my brother and his girlfriend watch them and they were instantly addicted.,1412294400,,116,4.086956521739131

5971867,5,B00F9HUQQM,Great!,1412121600,,6,6.0
5971868,1,B00F9HUQQM,"What can I say? I hated this series. Nothing made much sense to me, and it looked like the writers were just making stuff up as they were going along. It all falls apart from the first to the last episode.",1412121600,,205,4.024390243902439
5971869,5,B00F9HUQQM,"If you're just starting with this series---as I did---or thinking about it, just want to say real fast that it's great, but you have to get past the first couple of shows and get into the characters.
  It's terrific, and I'm addicted, but it took some time to get there. The first 2-3 shows' story lines were just too simple, too flat, not a lot of ups and downs or build-up. I have to admit, I put it away for a while.
  But I'm so glad I started again. Once you get to ""know"" them, what really makes this show are the fabulous characters and their actors: Monroe is amazing (where has this guy been?); Hank is the cop you always wished for, and Renard is just....also what you always think you wish for :) The camera just loves him, and when his lighting is good (even when it's ordinary, actually) it'll take your breath away. He also offers some mystery for the story line. But all the production---the special effects, scenery and the moodiness--- is outstanding.
  Sometimes I'd like a little more edge, or arc? in the story line, but I get the idea that's coming.
  Really, even though it started out slow, this show grows on you super-fast.",1411257600,,1148,4.433333333333334
5971870,5,B00F9HUQQM,This is a great new show I enjoy the storyline.,1408406400,,47,3.8

5971872,5,B00F9HUQQM,"WOW. We love entertainment in the genre of Buffy and Angel and Supernatural so Im glad Prime has free seasons of Grimm because my ENTIRE family is hooked!  So much, I even purchased the DVDs just so we own them outright, like we do the other series.  Very entertaining, and I always like that each episode starts and ends so you can pick up at any time.  Yes, there is a back story but its easy to catch up.  GREAT entertainment.",1405641600,,429,4.2592592592592595

5971877,5,B00F9HUQQM,"i was curious about the show and i loved it, and it didn't take long to get these seasons in. ill be buying season three when it comes out",1399593600,,138,3.793103448275862
5971878,5,B00F9HUQQM,"YES, again and again. Going back to the beginning and starting over was even better than watching it on television> Besides the obvious benefit of NO commercials, the discovery of small facts or issues between characters gives new meanings to many of the scenes. The make-up and masks of the villains are worthy of any awards given for this category as is the character of Monroe. I did not care for the packaging of Season one, but this is the only failing of this great TV show.....",1399075200,,484,4.574712643678161

5971880,5,B00F9HUQQM,"I like the show and watch it often, my wife on the other hand is a rabid fan and watches it over and over.  Knows all the charactors and can identify each Vessen by name.  She has a Vesson picture, history and indentification book, with well worn pages.  I bring her snacks and remind her to breath once in a while...... :~)  Seriously, we both enjoy the program very much and we both love Portland.  These DVD's are excellent quality and these provide lots of the extra's we come to expect from good quality DVD movies.",1398729600,,520,4.375
5971881,5,B00F9HUQQM,"I am an admitted movie addict, an have a very large collection.  I was looking for a good value for this set, which this was.  I was a little disappointed that the box was not in perfect condition, it was pretty beat up.  From visual inspection there does not appear to be any flaws, but this was a very good value for my money.  This is a great series if you like a little more ""supernatural"" type of show.",1398384000,,407,4.113924050632911

5971885,5,B00F9HUQQM,"I have not purchased this, I just have a question--why does it say runtime is 32 minutes? Is this the complete first two seasons? Don't want to buy unless I know I'm actually getting all the episodes.",1396137600,,200,4.4324324324324325

8613428,5,B00F9HUQQM,"I sat down one day to watch an episode with my mother and became a Grimm fan from that day forward.  Like one of the songs from the Supremes, this series just ""keeps you hangin' on.""  Like The Walking Dead series, I wonder where Grimm will take us.

Just Love being able to watch it(in order)as my schedule allows,even it it's not a whole episode(pausing,then coming back another day). Even some of the deleted scenes help the story line make more sence. Hope it continues for Many more seasons untill it's appreciated by a larger viewership. Also,Good chemistry between the cast members!!!",1415232000,,388,5.174603174603175
