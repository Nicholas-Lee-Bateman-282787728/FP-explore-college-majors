7943506,3,B00005KJV6,I thought the video of the Queen Mother was good! It gave a general overview of the life of a icon in 20th Century Britain. I would reccomend this video to anyone who is interested in the British Monarchy.,1190592000,5,205,4.282051282051282
7943507,5,B00005KJV6,"This was the woman feared by Adolf Hitler!  The most noble of the noble, revered, loved, and an icon of stablity in times of war and peace. Her dislike for Wallis Warfield Simpson, the non-royal Duchess of Windsor, is most obvious. Above reproach, she was greatly admired and respected for the good that she did. A woman of steel and the stablising force behind King George VI.  EXCELLENT!!",1170633600,14,390,4.720588235294118
