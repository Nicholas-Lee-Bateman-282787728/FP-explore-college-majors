7743673,5,B01F57MY9W,"Great movie to add to our ""MOB"" collection. Hoodlum should be seen first since ""Bumpy Johnson"" is portrayed in this movie and then you should see ""American Gangster"" second that is about Bumpy Johnson's personal driver, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) picking up where Bumpy left off and then some. Both are true stories.",1474156800,2,321,5.0754716981132075
7743674,4,B01F57MY9W,"This is a really well executed (pun intended) movie. Very slick and polished. Beautiful set/production design, cinematography, screenplay, performances etc. Of course, Tim Roth just chews up the scenes he's in with a no holds barred portrayal of Dutch Schultz that nearly matches Tony Montana in insanity. Don't get me wrong, he's a joy to watch on screen, he's SO outrageous, so, so.... Uh, Trump-ian!

The story exposes a history that most folks, including myself, know nix about: the history of a rather young ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Lawrence Fishburne - ALWAYS excellent) and the REAL way it was down in Harlem in the 1930's especially at the racist Cotton Club. Truth be told, I really don't know how Bumpy restrained himself and his crew after suffering through the tirade of racist insults from Schultz... I guess they just had more smarts and WAY more class. The role of an older ""Bumby"" was portrayed by Clarence Williams III in the incredible ""American Gangster"".

Anyway, in my opinion, this is one CLASSY movie!",1473292800,3,1016,4.970588235294118

7743677,3,B01F57MY9W,"I love the movie but I hate the distributor of the blu-ray (Olive Studios).  Olive does not include any special features on any of their disc.

I don't mean interviews but basic features such as closed captions or subtitles.  Close captions are extremely important for people who are hard of hearing and subtitles are useful for people where English is their second language.

If you have the original DVD keep it and pass on this version.",1468972800,2,439,4.7368421052631575

8760142,5,B01F57MY9W,This a great gangster movie with a lot of heart. I'd go as far as to put it almost right next to GoodFellas. Notice I said almost which is still saying a lot. It just so happens that Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies of all time and Hoodlum isn't far behind.,1523664000,,265,4.018867924528302

8760148,3,B01F57MY9W,"The gangster movie has been a staple in film since, well, the time of gangsters. Thugs and mob bosses, godfathers and goombahs, the stereotypes are always brought together mixing fact and fiction to tell a compelling story. For the most part these films have chosen to surround themselves with Italian based gangsters with the mafia being an easy target. But on occasion other stories are told and are quite satisfying such as HOODLUM.

The true story of Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne), a young black numbers runner in Harlem who did his time and returns in the employ of Stephanie ""The Queen"" St. Clair (Cicely Tyson). When she is sentenced to jail for racketeering she leaves Bumpy in charge with the promise of no bloodshed.

Bumpy continues to build the empire of St. Clair with himself at the top of the heap. Along the way he establishes a deal with the then de facto mob boss Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia). In return for a small tribute Bumpy is allowed to run the numbers and other criminal enterprises in Harlem. This sets him up as a hero of the neighborhood, someone who can work with the mob and retain his own heritage.

But things don't go as planned and Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) makes the decision to move into Bumpys territory in spite of the truce. Going against Luciano doesnt help his cause though. Eventually Bumpy and Dutch will but heads and blood will flow in spite of past promises made. At stake will be the control of crime in Harlem.

While it claims to be a complete fictional account of events the film is based in some historical reality. There really was a Bumpy Johnson and he was the crime lord of Harlem. The same holds true for both Luciano and Schultz. What has been slightly altered is the storytelling that takes place around these names and the actual events that involved them.

Well made, well shot, well acted and well directed. The film did well enough at the box office but wasn't a mega-hit which it should have been. Fishburne was in the midst of his most popular status, 4 years out from WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT and 2 years ahead of THE MATRIX. He turns in a great performance here with a seething anger that builds rather than an off the handle scream fest. Actor turned director Bill Duke does a fantastic job and why he wasn't presented with higher priced and more supported projects is anyones guess.

In the end the question is does the movie entertain and the answer is yes. The story is interesting and all things combined to tell it make it one worth taking a look at. Its even more interesting when you realize that the character of Bumpy Johnson has been in more movies than this one. Fishburne himself played a character based on him in THE COTTON CLUB and Denzel Washingtons film AMERICAN GANGSTER had a character based on Bumpy that advises him. Knowing that makes this movie one to go back and check out again from a new perspective.",1508716800,2,2901,4.5585412667946255
