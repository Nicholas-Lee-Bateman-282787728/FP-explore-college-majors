Great documentary about this Great Man. Mister Lee still the Best for ever !",1236729600,,246,10.181818181818182
7955260,3,B00005UQ9B,"I picked this up very very cheap in a supermarket, and I know why now.
The main part of the DVD is a documentary which is quite interesting but really has nothing new to say about Bruce Lee. It contains a lot of stock footage which I have seen before.

For what I paid (1 in the UK!), and baring in mind I actually don't own any other Bruce Lee documentaries, this is fine. If it costs more than that and you already have documentaries about Bruce Lee its probably not worth buying.",1222300800,,482,4.182795698924731
7955261,3,B00005UQ9B,"I saw this episode of Biography under the new title ""Bruce Lee - Immortal Dragon"" on a low-priced DVD. While it doesn't go into enormous detail and is relatively short, it is still a pretty entertaining and complete version of Bruce Lee's life. I would reccommend it mostly to aspiring fans of Lee. One part of the documentary that I liked was a nifty section on the many Bruce Lee imitators that came after Lee's death. Like most documentaries found in the bargain bin, the film clips are mostly from public domain sources.
As an extra feature, the DVD contains trailers for Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection,"" ""Fists of Fury,"" ""Enter the Dragon,"" and ""Return of the Dragon,"" as well as trailers for Jackie Chan's ""The Big Brawl,"" Steven Seagal's ""Above the Law,"" and Chuck Norris' ""The Octagon"" and ""A Force of One."" All of these trailers are pretty entertaining. The biggest shortcoming of the DVD is that it contains no chapter stops - this is a source of frustration.",1070668800,3,974,4.735294117647059
7955262,4,B00005UQ9B,"This DVD looks to be the same show that A&E aired as their biography of Bruce Lee (1 hour version).  The quality of the transfer is good - both picture and sound - but not great.
Two things that annoyed me are:
1) Several motion clips and stills were used over and over, detracting from the generally good quality of the production and
2) The ""extras"" consist solely of several trailers for martial arts movies, some of which Bruce Lee had nothing to do with.
Still, for ten bucks, it's a good deal.",1026864000,3,499,4.365591397849462
7955263,3,B00005UQ9B,"A VIDEO OF SUPERB VISUAL QUALITY. UNLIKE EXCELLENT BRUCE LEE DOCUMENTARIES: ""CURSE OF THE DRAGON"", AND ""MARTIAL ARTS MASTER"", WHOSE DIALOG FREEFLOWS FROM THOSE INTERVIEWED IN ILLUMINATING AND INFORMATIVE FASHION, THIS DOCUMENTARY FAILS, BY HOLDING THOSE INTERVIEWED ON LEE TO QUICK AND LIMITED STATEMENTS, PERMITTING COMMENTS PERTAINING ONLY TO THE DOCUMENTARIES PRE-SCRIPTED AND HURRIED AGENDA.AS AN ORIGINAL MADE FOR TELEVISION PIECE WITH TIME CONSTRAINTS, IT RUSHES ALONG, CRAMMING EVERYTHING INTO A SET TIME SLOT OF ONLY 50 MINUTES, SIMPLY DISPLAYING WHAT LEE DID IN HIS LIFE, WITHOUT EXAMINING THE DEPTH OF THE MAN HIMSELF WITHIN THESE EVENTS. A NICE APPETIZER, DEFINATELY NOT THE FULL COURSE.",1008201600,,698,5.6571428571428575
