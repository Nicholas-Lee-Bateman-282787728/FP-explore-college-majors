2770753,2,6303111920,"Sorcerer's Apprentice is the latest Disney attempt at cashing in on old glories, and falls way short of the mark.  Bruckheimer Studios can usually be counted on to entertain without cramping too many brain cells, but this one relies on the tired old argument of 'it's a kid's movie, it doesn't have to try so hard'...

Tell that to The Last Airbender.

Very uneven, it all comes down to the special effects, which are good but nothing new.  And when it takes six people to write the script, you know you got problems.

Based upon the classic Disney short of the same title, it's expanded into a decent enough story idea: three apprentices- Balthazar (Cage), Veronica (Monica Bellucci) and Horvath (Alfred Molina) serve under Merlin- yes, THAT Merlin- and are aiding him in his struggles against Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige).  Horvath joins forces with Morgana to defeat Merlin and steal a powerful spell that will give her unspeakable powers... you know the drill.  Veronica stops her by absorbing Morgana's essence into herself and Balthazar traps them both in the Grimhold- an enchanted nesting doll- and later manages to catch Horvath and his allies in it as well.  With Merlin gone, Balthazar stalks through the ages trying to find the Prime Merlinian (seriously)- the descendant of Merlin who can finally defeat Morgana.  Not to be outdone, Horvath and his ilk are known as Morganians.

Enter Dave (Jay Baruchel), the nerdy hero.  As a child he stumbles into Balthazar's arcane shop and is revealed to be the PM, but accidentally frees Horvath from the Grimhold.  To protect Dave, Balthazar traps both himself and Horvath within an enchanted urn on a timer- ten years later the spell breaks, freeing them both.  Balthazar finds Dave and takes him under his wing as they search for Horvath and the Grimhold.  And being a nerdy hero, Dave conveniently has access to an underground locale suitable for both learning sorcery and his Tesla-based energy experiments at NYU... Yep.

The movie is clearly tongue-in-cheek all the way but never really works. Cage is comical enough and you can tell Molina has a good time chewing up the scenery, but Bellucci has almost no screen time and is woefully underused when she is on.  Baruchel's nerdy hero is almost stereotypical at this point but he has a few moments, and Tony Kebbell as a Morganian who's a Criss Angel send-up is entertaining.  There are some good one-liners but the funnier moments usually take some setting up, which defeats the purpose of an action-adventure movie.  And when you have to be hit over the head with something because the writers think the audience will still miss it (the Star Wars joke), why use it?  The seminal mop and broom cleaning scene is also played strictly for laughs and doesn't work.  At all.  Yeah- it had to be there, but unfortunately served no purpose and was poorly done besides.

Sorcerer's Apprentice is another in a string of summer movies that are less than the sum of their parts.  It has humor, action, casting... and still doesn't do anything for you. Unless you're a babysitter needing to keep the kids occupied or just really bored, give it a pass.",1279065600,7,3151,4.815985130111524
2770754,4,6303111920,"First off guys, you have nothing to worry about. I'm not a studio plant. You can check my review profile for proof of this.

Earlier tonight I had the chance of seeing this movie at a screening held by my radio station. I got the passes through them and took my girlfriend. I admit I saw the trailer and thought, ""ah, looks cool. I may check it out in the theatres."" So I went in expecting what I got in the trailers, with not much else for expectations.

Anyone who has seen the trailer will know what to expect- a pretty straightforward plot, with Baruchel and Cage fronting the film, tonnes of action and great special effects. To my surprise, with that as my main expectation, I was surprised with how entertaining the movie was! Of course, you can't think it won't cheesy and clich free. But even with the clichs in the film, it's still a load of fun. The plot is not amazing, but the fun, the action, and the great humor was enough to make up for it.

The performances are nothing short of excellent. Jay Baruchel does a great job playing his usual ""nerdy"" character, if you've seen movies like The Trotsky or She's Out of My League, or even the previews for this movie you'll know you're not seeing anything different. Nonetheless he still does a great job and we all love his job at playing Dave. I also loved Nicholas Cage a GREAT deal, and I don't normally like him, but he was great in Kick-Ass and Bad Lieutenant earlier this year, and I could kinda foretell he would continue his awesome streak, and he does so. He plays Balthazar very mysteriously yet comically. Also great was Alfred Molina as Maxim and Tony Kebbell's very flamboyant portrayal of Drake Stone.

The action scenes are a real breath of fresh air- FINALLY a movie where the action scenes are comprehensible! Obviously it's a family movie so Turteltaub wouldn't choose the popular shaky-camera quick edit style. The action is really fun! There's tonnes of it and the special effects are a good bonus too. There's tonnes of humor in the film, and it was NOT just what you see in the trailer that was funny. There's one particularly hilarious scene in the middle which I won't spoil since it's too funny!

Overall, while not a masterpiece, The Sorcerer's Apprentice was a fun time at the cinema, and a good film for the family, even if it leans towards a tad frightening in some parts. That said, I'd recommend it for sure and it'll make for a good brainless summer action flick for the whole family.",1278547200,3,2476,4.505567928730512
2770755,4,6303111920,"This Video is a collection of two of episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Chaney Vase and The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  The First Episode is about an employee at a Bank, played by Darren McGavin.  When things at the bank turn troublesome McGavin's character seeks employment with one of the Bank's wealthy patrons in an attempt to get her most prized possession, the Chaney Vase.  I will not spoil the ending, but this one is vintage Hitchcock.  The Next Episode, the Sorcerer's Apprentice, is about a mentally challenged young lad, played by Brandon DeWilde who meets up with the magician from a travelling circus, but things get quite interesting when the Magician's wife gets the young boy confused about her husband.  It is a great story, and the ending is absolutely bone chilling.  Be advised, however, I have this edition and the picture is not digitally restored, and thus a little worn.  The picture is actually better than most of Hitch's old British films, and the stories more than make up for it. This video is a must have for any die hard Hitchcock fan.",975283200,3,1071,4.788043478260869

Rented cuz my intuition told me I wouldn't want to see this again for years and by then it'll be streaming for free.  Lots of CGI and magic powers being used, but yawn....so tired of writers just thinking up the same old kinds of stuff and distracting instead of story telling.  Meh.

2771057,5,6303111920,"""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is fast-paced and campy, which is a perfect combination for good old fashioned fantasy entertainment. Nicolas Cage's performance as Balthazar Blake is just as I'd expected: goofy, yet endearing. Alfred Molina, as always, is delightful as a villain, especially the  tongue-in-cheek villain, Horvath. Jay Baruchel (Dave) is the epitome of my idea of a physics nerd, and he comes across believable as the reluctant hero. I appreciated that the girlfriend Becky (actress Theresa Palmer) was understanding of Dave's oddities of character and personality quirks. She was able to look deeper to find out who Dave was underneath his surface of nerdiness, instead of reacting in an angry or put-out way when their 'dates' didn't turn out as she might have expected.",1465948800,,784,5.32258064516129

2771401,3,6303111920,"For pure escapism, THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE fits the bill.  And that's about it:  it's a mile wide and an inch deep, but it delivers an over-the-top story in grand Disney fashion.  One of Merlin's original three apprentices, Balthazar (Nicolas Cage), must stop another apprentice, Horvath (Alfred Molina is fabulous), from unleashing an evil spirit to destroy mankind.  But he must first enlist the aid of another evolving apprentice, geeky Dave (an annoying Jay Baruchel), who must learn the art of magic, and who has little to no self-confidence he can compete in the magical world.  The stage is set for the ultimate showdown between the three antagonists/protagonists; it's predictable and mostly contrived, but it's still fun to watch.

Cage is softly subdued, and that's a good thing, given this actor's penchant for tweaking the 9th power of annoyance.  He plays well off the nerdy Baruchel; even better when confronting Molina's character.  And of course Dave has a secret crush on blonde bombshell Becky (Teresa Palmer), who predictably has feelings of her own for the young sorcerer.  But the most fun with THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE is when it pays homage to the Disney classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>, when a cluster of mops goes animated rogue.  That kind of fun will put a smile on your face, and allow THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE to lightly entertain for 100-plus minutes.

2771416,4,6303111920,"When I first heard about The Sorcerer's Apprentice, I wasn't impressed enough to put it on my much watch list.  But the more I heard about it, the more I wanted to see it.  I finally got to sit down and watch it last night, only to find out that I missed a fun movie.

Since the movie basically has two prologues, it's a bit hard to describe, but here goes.  When Dave was 10, he wandered away from a class field trip and had a weird experience in a magic shop.  He tried to put it behind him, even changing schools.  But on his 20th birthday, the events of that day are going to come back to haunt him.

First up, Dave (Jay Baruchel) finds himself face to face with Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), a man who is demanding the location of a stacking doll.  When Dave doesn't know, Horvath sends a pack of wolves after him.  That's a little strange in New York City.  But Dave is saved by Balthazar (Nicolas Cage) who flies in on a gargoyle to save him.

Turns out that Horvath and Balthazar are locked in a centuries old battle of good and evil with Horvath out to destroy the world.  And Dave?  Well, he just might be the person that Balthazar has spent centuries looking for who can put a stop to the battle once and for all.  Can Dave find his powers in time for the coming confrontation?

Okay, so the movie turned out to be fairly predictable.  I had the big brush strokes figured out long before they happened.  But this movie is another case of the fun being in the journey, not the twists along the way.  I had an absolutely blast joining Dave on this journey.

Part of the reason I enjoyed the movie was the big scenes.  The confrontation scenes between good and evil were very well done.  They were the perfect mix of humor and suspense since they made me worried about the characters while still laughing at some of the absurd things going on around them.  And the special effects were outstanding.  I bought every thing I saw.

But I've got to say I also enjoyed the movie because of Dave.  He's an awkward geek that you just can't help but root for.  He's got a love interest who just adds to his charm.  Balthazar started out a bit strange, but by the end of the movie I really liked him, too.

The acting was great all around as far as I am concerned.  Nicolas Cage and Alfred Molina were the only names I was familiar with in the cast.  I've always thought they were great when I saw them in a movie, and this one is no exception.  Jay Baruchel is the one who stood out to me.  I've seen complaints about his acting here being too nerdy and whiney; I thought it was perfect.  Rounding out the main cast is Teresa Palmer as Dave's love interest Becky.  She brought a real warmth to the role that made it easy to see why Dave loved her.

Of course, most people associate The Sorcerer's Apprentice with the famous segment from Fantasia where Mickey tries to get a broom to do his chores and winds up losing control of them.  There's a scene here that pays homage to it and is mostly fun.  I didn't care for one aspect of it, but it was a minor complaint.  There are also hilarious references to Star Wars and the first Indiana Jones movie over the course of the film.

There's a final scene after the credits that pays one final bit of homage to the original and sets things up for a potential sequel.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice doesn't break any new ground story wise, but it's a fun trip with characters you come to really like.  If you want to escape into a movie for a couple of hours, this is the movie for you.",1431648000,,3527,4.2357357357357355
2771417,4,6303111920,"I really liked this one.  Some of the acting was a little rough.  It apparently wasn't a hit at the box office, but I felt the story moved well and it was a good ride.  Maybe not a great one, but definitely worth the time to watch it.",1431648000,,234,3.8333333333333335

2771665,5,6303111920,This movie isn't very well known.  It is basically an extension of Mickey Mouse's experience as a magician's apprentice & the haywire that happens when he uses a spell & doesn't have it under control.  But it is a good extension.  Using that one scene they brought a whole movie out of it.  And it's a good movie with a good plot to it & very well acted by all & not just Nicolas Cage & Alfred Molina.

It is an unusual role for Cage to play but I think he does it very well.  It is very good with the adventure and the humor thrown in.

Nicholas Cage and Alfred Molina did a marvelous job as the two apprentices of Merlin. Nicholas cage plays the tortured soul apprentice who has deciated his life to finding Merlin's heir and combating the forces of Morganna Le Fey. Alfred Molina plays a great villain, a former apprentice of Merlin turned traitor and foil to Nicholas Cage!

So, in a sense, for those of you who GET IT, it's a Disney film (like days of old). It has a like-able character in Nicolas Cage, a pretty girl (in Teresa Palmer), and a nerdie, semi-genius, in Jay Baruchel. The screen play is workable and the direction keeps you interested. It's entertainment from the old school. There's really no sex or foul language, nothing particularly violent or obtrusive. Perhaps the modern film goer might it a bit lame? For me, it was pure and sweet and enjoyable, and thus I give it high marks!",1378771200,5,640,4.38655462184874

2771808,5,6303111920,"There are so many classic Disney films, I'd like to stress what distinguishes this one alongside of several of my favorite illustrated animation films.  Whereas ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is completely digital animation, I'm thinking of two scenes in particular which would make this a fantastic investment of entertainment time to any viewer.  The first is a retake on the famous illustrated Mickey Mouse role as a sorcerer's apprentice from the classical-music animated Disney spectacular,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia-Special-60th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia (Special 60th Anniversary Edition)</a>.  The second would be the China Town scene of Dave being chased by the transmutated Chinese Dragon.  Comedy and sheer dramatic suspense expressed in special effects media is state of the art.

Some of my very favorite Disney animated films include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0013ND30W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-in-the-Stone/dp/B0060CSX4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword in the Stone</a>,  and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-In-Wonderland/dp/B004IQ78HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice In Wonderland</a>.  In my opinion, most of the 20th century offerings of Disney Studios were in some ways indebted to the pioneering creative teams who brought us these films.  The personal touch of Walt Disney in their creation included selecting a quality of fantasy literature that makes humanity dream.

""Sleeping Beauty"" offers us a medieval Christian interpretation on a Germanic/Nordic Orphic-cycle myth which resonates with caricatures of the descent of Baldur to the land of the dead, forbidden Niffelheim, Hella's domain.  But unlike the sorry ends of Orpheus and Eurydice, or Baldur Odinson, in Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" the good faeries equip Prince Phillip with a sword of Truth, a shield of Virtue, and against ""all the forces of Hell, True Love shall conquer all.""

In the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", it's love with it's and courage and loyalty which ultimately stands in the way of Morgana's most evil spell.  Another creative 'take two' which was a key theme of ""Sword in the Stone"" is the emphasis on education.  ""Sword in the Stone"" was based loosely on a T.H. White novel, ""The Once and Future King"", and the tutor/teacher Merlin of Disney's movie becomes an advocate for literacy.

""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is a completely unique story, where Balthazar (protege of Merlin) is adamant about the importance of Dave's studies.  He also carries within himself and old, old love.  At last ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"", like ""Alice in Wonderland"" preys upon the human curiosity for that which is just out of sight.  It transforms the commonplace of everyday life to be a lively host to the larger arena of the human imagination.",1376697600,2,3171,6.695121951219512

2771826,2,6303111920,"Hey, it's got Disney, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Nicolas Cage - what could go wrong?

They tried hard, I'll give them that.  They put a lot of work into expanding a small bit from ""Fantasia"" into a feature-length film.  They would have been better off starting from scratch, though.  Disney's tale of an immortal sorceror looking for the next Merlin (who turns out to be the least-liked kid in school, of course) is by turns slow, uneven, and predictable.  Everyone tries very hard, but the movie just can't generate any sustained interest.  From the overly-long prologue which already had me checking my watch, to the painfully predictable subplot of the apprentice's budding romance with the (of course) hottest girl in school, there's no part of this movie that holds your attention.

Sure, there are a ton of plot holes, the story is mediocre and you've got Nicholas Cage with some crazy hair, but it's also a Disney movie (albeit a Disney movie based off of a 5 minute portion of another movie).

Special Effects / ""How they did it"": Very good
Homage to Sorcerer's Apprentice: Original in Fantasia (Animated) - Well they knew before they did it that it would give rise to comparisons and they should not be disappointed if those viewing found it wanting.

Their performances were fine of course, but even their talent couldn't save such a vapid absence of plot. The movie was empty. Flat. Shallow. I'm having difficulty describing the movie without letting Turret's Syndrome get the best of me. It's almost impossible to describe this film without the use of profanity. If I could sue Disney to get back the 109 minutes of my life I wasted watching this, rest assured I would. There is now a massive black hole in my sole, and I don't think even watching Robert Iger fall into a puddle of ostrich vom would make me feel better, but I'd be willing to watch it just the same.",1361836800,2,734,4.485074626865671

When a movie starts out with swords and wizards in the 8th century, and then all of a sudden jumps to a kid on the school bus with Jimmy Eat World playing in the background, you know you're in for some trouble. This story is about a Sorcerer, looking for his mythological apprentice, to fight an evil that could destroy the world. The film stars action veteran Nicholas Cage. It's got a huge budget for lots of cool special effects...and Disney turns into a kids movie with a farting dog, a fantasiaesq cleaning scene, and of course a nerd who becomes a hero. It had such potential, but turned out to be such a Disney Clich that I wanted to vomit.

I was delightfully surprised to find that it is actually an effective dual love story that ends with a romantic connection through time.

The Apprentice in the title is a nerdy young kid who becomes the protege of ancient Wizard Nicolas Cage, whose performance is so low-keyed, it's astonishing that it works.  Without divulging the plot, this is a journey through the arcane and the wonderful, involving magical devices of all kinds.

I'd recommend giving this one a look-see; it's well produced with startlingly decent effects, and is a good evening's entertainment.",1360454400,,714,5.348214285714286

If you can get past that (It was impossible in the theater but easier on DVD) it is a great film. It is clear that there were a couple of major changes made during filming based on special effects logistics. It would have been more fun to see Cage and Molina's character wage war over the centuries rather than watching Cage trying to teach his new apprentice.

It doesn't take itself too seriously (it is a comedy, after all!) and it provides a good excuse to pop some corn and relax for a couple of hours.  I especially appreciate the minimal amount of swearing in the movie, which in my book is a plus for any movie!  Although there are a couple of ""dark"" scenes (eg., the fight between Merlin and Morgana; knives through a car's windshield), the movie doesn't spend any more time on them than is necessary for plot or character development.  (The only other ""down"" side to the movie--if such it is--comes after the credits, with the short clip that suggests a sequel but which, to my knowledge, hasn't yet been made.  Hey Disney, I'm waiting!)  In the end--and in classic Disney fashion--the bad guy (and gal) loses, the boy gets the girl and everyone lives happily ever after.

Nope. But it was still a lot of fun and I liked the movie more than I thought I would after seeing extended previews about what it was really about!

I was especially impressed after watching the special features and seeing that they used real fire for some of the magic scenes. Wow. Isn't that unusual today? They also put chemicals into the fire to make it the different pretty colors. No wonder it looked so awesome! Not that they didn't overdo the CGI here and there, but oh well. Since the effects fit into the plot and (for the most part) didn't overshadow the story, it worked. I thought the car chase was a little drawn out, but then I don't like car chases in general. They are usually too long, and they usually break, dent, or completely ruin gorgeous, shiny cars. That just breaks my heart.

I enjoyed the homage to Fantasia. It was similar, yet not just an identical live-action imitation. Good job!

I thought the ending to the movie was a bit abrupt, after the way the apprentice's training was going. I don't really want to go into detail on that so as not to give anything away.

2771957,2,6303111920,"With The Sorcerer's Apprentice Jerry Bruckheimer tries to get Pirates magic with another movie idea devoid of originality and long on product tie-ins and deals made with the devil, er, Disney, and his tried (or should I say tired?) and trusted star attraction Nicolas Cage. Who do these guys think they are - Tim Burton and Johnny Depp?

Nicolas Cage is not Johnny Depp for many reasons, but in this movie it's because the idiosyncratic joy of Depp's Captain Jack only exposes Cage's plodding and monotone performance for the lifeless paycheck it is. As Balthazar, an apprentice of Merlin who has been charged with finding the one person who can win the epic battle of good vs. evil, Cage does what he's been doing for decades now - dead panning lines, flashing his wide eyes, and letting us all know how much Botox he uses. I used to like Nicolas Cage back in his Raising Arizona days, but something happened and he's grown into one of the most wooden actors this side of Keanu Reeves.

Then you have Jay Baruchel, an actor renowned for his nasally whine best suited for cartoon voiceover than real life roles. In two of the three main roles you have very dull actors, so you're already in trouble. The only actor who brings it is Alfred Molina, but herein he seems wasted and schticking it up more than anything else. It's always easy to play the villain and he's more than capable of injecting some life into the tired character he's given.

There are a handful of in-jokes, but these have become tiresome and Disney/Pixar seems to think people just love to scour their movies for them. Here's an idea - how about writing better movies so I don't have to amuse myself with looking for product placement or the homage to older and better movies?

This movie was bland and thoroughly predictable, all the way down to the wait-for-the-very-end-of-the-closing-credits sequel teaser, ala all the Pirates movies. These kinds of paint by numbers productions are the norm when Hollywood seeks to put together some summer or holiday blockbuster, but I wish that they would try harder to put some creativity and originality into these projects instead of following their tired formula. Big money is being spent on old tv show retreads, sequels ad nauseum (remember how embarrassing Jaws 3-D was? Nowadays a blockbuster movie just isn't worth its salt unless it can be milked for a minimum of three installments), movies based on toys, and now the movie-izations of Disney amusement park rides and short cartoons. Walt Disney must truly be spinning in his cryogenic chamber.

Hey...maybe there's a movie in there somewhere...frozen creative guy is brought back to life to stop the world from the takeover of aliens who disguise themselves as the tea cup ride! Somebody call Jerry Bruckheimer and Shia LeBeouf!",1329609600,2,2801,4.839248434237996

The director was unsure if he had set out to make a movie for kids or for the baby boomers, a comedy or an adventure. Why does the Prime Merlinean, who is supposed to save the world from the vicious Morgana, act and look like a bird brain? In movies where it is about saving the world, the hero can not be a fatuous bum. I have recently watched a few such disasters, which suffered from this very problem (read my review on The Green Lantern and R.A One). Barring one or two scenes, this movie left me cold.

Like Pirates, this movie had little to do with the thing it was based off of, minus a short tribute scene.
While the film had lots of potential and some pretty cool magic tricks, overall, the film came short in a lot of different aspects. The film felt very rushed (in the same way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eragon/dp/B000NA28I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eragon</a>&nbsp;was rushed) in the sense that it felt like the filmmakers were trying to get through each scene as quickly as possible. This left little room for character, emotional, and situational development. Each scene would start to develop and then it would jump to the next scene.
The movie also came packed full of loopholes and ""unnecessarys"". That means that there were a lot of things and characters that had no logic or purpose in the movie. And they'd introduce something that would seem important, but it ended up having no real purpose in the film. That, and the movie was predictable.
Aside from those things, the special effects were nice, the music was well chosen (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Middle/dp/B000VZLMWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Middle</a>"" by Jimmy Eat World and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets/dp/B002WPVO1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets</a>"" by OneRepublic), and there were some pretty cool visuals.

*Spoiler Alert*
The thing I liked most in this film was the use of electricity to create music. My favorite scene was near the end when Dave was fighting Morgana and he used the lamp electricity against her; if you listen you can hear how the electricity generates the film's musical score during the scene. Subtle, but I thought it was a really nice filmmaking technique to employ. Very classy.

2771966,4,6303111920,"The Sorcerers Apprentice(released July/10)is a very enjoyable flick,employing some very engaging special effects that blend seamlessly with the action on screen.
The film opens with an introduction of the protagonist,in this case Nicholas Cage as Balthazar Blake,and the antagonist in the form of Alfred Molina as Maxim Horvath. Both were apprentices to the legendary Merlin, who both fell in love with another of his apprentices Veronica,played by Monica Bellucci. Maxim became a bitter rival to Balthazar,turning to the dark side of the magical craft and joining forces with an evil sorceress named Morganna,played by Alice Krige. At one point to save her love Veronica ""absorbs"" the evil Morganna into her and in turn Balthazar is forced to imprison them into a nesting doll along with Maxim. Before Merlin dies he gives Balthazar a dragon ring and charges him to find his successor,the Prime Merlinean,who will ultimately defeat the evil Morganna and Maxim.
Over a thousand years pass and Balthazar has come to New York and finally finds what he thinks is his successor in the form of one Dave,played by Jay Baruchel. He first meets him when Dave is a precocious ten year old,who is trying to retrieve a note from a girl he is smitten with. The note drifts lazily in the wind and leads him to an old antique shop run by Balthazar. Balthazar is convinced,when the dragon ring placed into Dave's hand suddenly animates and wraps around his finger. When Balthazar goes to retrieve some papers Dave discovers a nesting doll and by accident releases Maxim. Maxim and Balthazar are soon fighting again and end up both trapped inside a giant urn.
Dave runs out of the shop and throws the doll away and all the effects in the shop,including the urn,end up being sold to a myriad of different people. Fast forward 10 years and Dave is now a self described science geek who carries on experiments with Tesla technology in an old abandoned subway. In fact Dave is also a teacher and before the start of one of his classes he runs into his old flame,still a student,now in university,and begins to rekindle his old feelings for her. Meanwhile the urn that has sat 10 years now in an owners apartment,it is suddenly starting to jiggle,making the owner a little nervous. When it breaks open Maxim is the first out and he tries killing Balthazar by throwing the urn through the multi storied window. However Balthazar manages to escape just in time and he tracks Dave down once again. Dave becomes his reluctant student,but between his romantic excursions,he gets frustrated by his lack of progress.
Maxim is on the prowl as he wants that nesting doll or Grimhold,as it is referred to,for it contains Morganna,with whom he can rule the world with. To release Morganna he has to obtain more powers and this he does first by tracking down a ""helper"",from whom he extracts his magical essence after his usefulness is over. When he gets the doll and cracks the first egg it releases another spirit in the form of a Salem witch. When she does her turn he again extracts her power. After this he obtains the dragon ring from Dave and he is able to crack the last egg and release Morganna/Veronica. The location is Battery Park in Manhatten and Morganna begins to release the dead from around the world in an effort to take it over. Balthazar has asked Dave to stay behind while he tackles his nemesis alone,but Dave knows he won't succeed without his help. Balthazar confronts Morganna and Maxim at Battery Park and in the meantime Dave's girlfriend(now in on the picture) and Dave in a Tesla equipped car,head to aid Balthazar. When Dave arrives Balthazar has absorbed Morganna's evil spirit into him but she escapes and Dave and she battle it out. After a fight to the finish Dave wins the day and saves Balthazars life in the bargain. Balthazar and Veronica are reunited,Dave and his girlfriend are set for a new life together but Maxim,where has he gone? A final shot as the movie ends settles that as his hat,which Dave has picked up and put on the edge of the iron gate at the park,is now sitting in an antique shop. The camera pans slowly to the hat,but the unmistakable hand and cane of Maxim come into the picture,scooping up the hat. Fade to black. Sequel anyone?
Yes,if done properly this could be a nice little franchise for Disney. Cage and Molina make wonderful foes and I'm hoping Baruchel can shore up his acting skills in the next one. He blows hot and cold throughout the film and sometimes doesn't seem to be able to handle the subtleties of his character.
There are more than a few chase scenes and it is obvious to those who know Bruckheimer films,that he has gotten the chase scene down to a fine art. And this movie is no exception.
This being the Sorcerers Apprentice,the name harkens back to Disneys animated classic Fantasia. In that movie there was a sequence with Mickey Mouse putting on an enchanted hat and trying to become a competent magician in one fell swoop. Of course it didn't work out and chaos reigned supreme. Well THIS film has just such a sequence as Dave tries out his magical skills trying to clean up his laboratory with mops and buckets. Well everything goes to H-E double hockey sticks in no time flat and it takes Balthazar to clean it all up. A nice tie in.
Technically speaking the film has been wonderfully mastered and is in its original a/r of 2:40:1,and the sound picture are clear and crisp. Extras include a making of featurette,a deleted scene and some Disney promo shorts.
All in all a very good movie with a fast moving plot. The only weak spot is Baruchel,but Cage,Molina and the rest more than pick up the slack for his shortcomings. Bruckheimer,in his usual fashion,keeps the action scenes swift and sure and the S/FX are great. Top marks and highly recommended. 4-4 /2 stars.",1322352000,,5821,4.713444553483808

2771969,5,6303111920,">>> This review is based on the two-disc BD/DVD>>>

I am not a fan of Nick Cage. But every now and then he gets on a project that I get behind and end up loving. This retelling of the Sorcerer's Apprentice definitely manages qualification for one of the good ones. And what's not to like - the story has been told before, of course. Jay Baruchel (the protagonist Dave Stutler) does a decent job wearing the proverbial magician's cap and his acting is as equally decent. Nick Cage literally steals every scene of the film he is in. Alfred Molina, the villain Horvath, is one again a great evil who we find liking a bit more than we probably should. Special effects, gamer Easter eggs and the coolest stereo system ever allow us to get swept up in the story and we almost forget the version of the tale starring Mickey Mouse.

As for the Bonus Features, it is of the expected standards - Making Of's, Deleted Scenes, a featurette of the automobiles in the chase sequence and, my favourite - the Outtakes.

The DVD actually has a Making of that is not on the BD, but the DVD only sports one deleted scene, with these two being the extent of bonus materials.

The set has BDLive, DTS-HD a 2 channel audio track, and the typical language range. The DVD has infereor stats, as to be expected. But even this showing of the film includes a 5.1 as well.

This isn't a typical popcorn flick, as I call them. If you actually pay attention to everything going on in the film and are vaguely aware of geeky pop culture, you'll garner a lot more out of it. And even if you don't, you will be blown away with the incredible effects and witty banter, of which they have in troves.

It is not a 'violent film' (the on-screen violence is more tame than Star Wars or the DC Animated features) , and I do not recall much - if any - vulgarity. This is actually a good family movie, and that is not something we see very often. And thanks, Mr. Cage. He was the one talking to producers saying he wanted to do a mystic sort of hero. Well, he got his wish, but it is one we should all be able to enjoy.",1320883200,,2078,4.248101265822785

The story line is frankly not all that amazing...it's a traditional magic-filled battle between good and evil, with love hanging in the balance.  But then again, this is Disney.

Anyway, the special effects were pretty cool, but that's not what sold me on this film.  What sold me was the constant diet of amazingly funny one-liners!  I mean, they were there all the way through the show.  The comic relief was MAJOR relief.

The film does have some scary images, so this may not be the best match for the primary grade crowd of under 8 or 9-year olds.  Kids older than that, though will probably really like it.

This movie really has it all:
* the special effects are innovative and surprising in their application, and pleasing to the eye
* romance, not one but two, and both fairly convincing
* a fun story of the young apprentice conquering the ancient evil ... not new or original, no ... but entertainingly realized
* comedy. There are many laugh out loud moments, and the training sequences are truly amusing
* tension. The magical battles have you holding your breath.

It is sort of a cliche to say ""this is the role that so-and-so was born to play"". But there are concrete examples: Charlton Heston as Ben-Hur, Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, George C Scott as Patton, John Wayne as John Wayne, and yes ... John Goodman as Fred Flintstone. It is no stretch to say that Nicholas Cage was meant for the role of Balthazar in this film.

What you end up getting with this film is just a lot of special effects creating damage and destruction (but yet in Disney films, nobody ever get hit by flying debris) and there was even an embarrassing attempt to create a scene from the original ""Fantasia"" where the apprentice tries to clean up the room by bringing brooms and mops to life, and it then gets out of control.  That was either a truly dumb idea, or they just didn't plan how to make that more entertaining.

I feel that Jay did a wonderful job in portraying this character. He is supposed to be whiny and ""stupid"" as some say. In this particular story, he is being pulled unwillingly into a world that not many people believe in. It's against his logic. He's going to have trouble believing and learning because he finds it hard to believe. Being a physics student, he wants to look for a scientific explanation for what's happening to him. He's in a fantasy realm, so to speak.

I think the casting was done very well. I know Nicolas Cage looked rough in the movie, however, if you were supposed to portray someone that old, you would have to look a bit rough yourself.

Sadly, this in comparison struggles to be more than a joyless exercise in marketing.
After a short preamble in which we learn an awful lot of backstory involving Merlin and his apprentices, we move to New York, and Nicholas Cage searching for the heir to Merlin's powers, apparently in the form of an assuming nerdy boy more interested in being noticed by his childhood sweetheart.  Jay Baruchel essays the nerdiness well, and approaches a level of charm that might endear you to his character and will him on, and Teresa Palmer comes across as having a new Naomi Watts -meets-Heather Graham blue eyed charm, but they, and Cage, are let down by a clunky script which searches for set pieces to use up the obviously impressive budget.  Alfred Molina is hammy even by his standards, but then treating his role any other way than over the top would be ridiculous, so it actually works here.  Overall though, the tone is so uneven you're never sure whether you're supposed to be gasping at the efforts to (yawn) destroy the world, or smirking at the attempts at humour, mostly at the expense of the age gap between Cage and his younger co-star.  Too often the efforts filmmakers lose the classic Disney touch of crafting a movie that works for a younger generation, and cross the line to just making it childish.  It just doesn't work well, and the lack of any surprises along the way left me completely disengaged when clearly I was supposed to be emotionally invested in the outcome.  In fact, the only scene that feels like it has any charm is the scene homaging the original.  I'm left with the nagging feeling that the 3 or 4 minute backstory at the start of the movie felt like it might have made a more interesting movie...
Make no mistake, if you like Cage in big budget special effects showcases, or are looking for something to keep the kids amused for a while, then this is brash and spectacular enough that you'll be fine.

This is the ultimate nerd-power movie. On the one hand, you have the sorcerers of myth (major nerd fodder), and, on the other, a physics genius (more major nerd fodder). Does it get better (at least to us nerds)? Yes, it does! Throw Jay Baruchel in, and the Essence of Nerd is complete indeed.

For the uninitiated (non nerds) out there, there is still much to love about this film. The story is fun and, while the main character is the ultimate nerd (as I say, a physics buff as well as an arch magician), he's human too (in case you were wondering...). The plot has a smattering of fairly original bits, but its charm lies more in the enjoyable characters and fast-paced story than in its originality.

(spoilers)

Nicholas Cage plays Balthazar, a sorcerer who must find the heir to Merlin's powers. That, of course, is Jay Baruchel's character, Dave. Their first, ill-timed meeting, when Dave is 9, puts the future ""Prime Merlinian"" well and truly on the path to Nerdom, and costs him any shot at popularity (or, he thinks, the girl he's already in love with, Becky).
Fast forward ten years, and Dave is a physics genius...with no real life outside of his studies and experiments. Cue in the chance meeting with Becky, his childhood crush, and the prospect of a life outside of physics class seems more likely.
This, however, is complicated by the return of Balthazar, and his arch-rival, Horvath. Oh, and Horvath's little scheme to release Morgana from a one thousand year imprisonment and end the world.

(end spoilers)

The movie is exciting and fast-paced (a little too fast paced, at times, it seemed), and holds the viewer's interest very well. Nicholas Cage (whose acting I don't care much for generally) plays his part well; Jay Baruchel is fantastic, and makes his character's foibles believable; and the other actors/actresses are all very good as well. (I was amazed to find out that Horvath's goth-esque apprentice was the same actor who played the youngest of the three brothers in Prince of Persia -- Toby Kebbell...wow! I'm impressed by his ability to so easily transition between such very different roles). The story is hardly a work of art or genius, but it is a fun and enjoyable one.

2772018,3,6303111920,"Disney likes wizards; they've done a movie incarnation of wizards at least once a decade starting with the original Fantasia.  Going thru films such as Fantasia 2000, the Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Aladdin, we now have a non-animated addition to this genre.  Based very loosely of the original Mickey Mouse short in Fantasia, this movie is driven primarily by the good dialogue, witty comedy, and low-key but effective special effects.  The action scenes are many, but short.  The story itself is somewhat predictable with two overlapping romances, a rivalry, an evil witch, and a lurking army of the dead that needs to be kept dead.  The sum of the parts is what was to be expected in the summer of 2010; a big-name movie filled with big name stars and worth the two hours of escapism.",1297209600,2,803,4.707142857142857
2772019,4,6303111920,"Another solid hit from Disney. Everything you would want in a fantasy adventure. Great story, directing, acting, music, and special effects. This should entertain the whole family. Nicholas Cage does a great job as Merlin's apprentice that has looked for a thousand years to find his own apprentice, capably played by Dave Baruchel (Is it me or does he make you think of a young Christian Slater?). Most the action takes place in the streets of current day New York City. I really felt comfortable with this one, it never goes over the top or out of bounds of believeable fantasy. Not heavy handed or brutal like far to many movies at this time. Disney needs to receive a pat on the back for a movie Walt Disney would be proud to release. Something that has been lacking in to many of Disney's films of late. It doesn't make you put your palm over your face and say ""What were they thinking?"".

The main character is truly from DORK CENTRAL as he tries to learn the ways of sorcery from Balthazar (supposedly one of the Three Wise Men), played by Nicholas Cage, who believes that dork boy is the next great sorcerer comparable to Merlin, former master to Balthazar.  Get that all?  Anyway, there are some nice twists and turns with a good spread of impressive enough CGI and the humor is better than I thought it would be.  The love story is about what you would expect and the ending has a brief moment where you hold your breathe after the climax but you suspect it's going to work out and it does.  The main villain and his apprentice are better done than expected.  The usages of entrapping sorcerers is compellingly done.

...I liked it.

The good?
Nick Cage turns in a convincing performance, as does Molina.
The FX were done incredibly well.
The score, pacing, plot etc... were all spot on.

The bad?
Kid actors are usually hit or miss and with this movie the main character was incredibly annoying...well...his voice was anyway.
Other than that, ""Apprentice"" was leaps and bounds above the usual live action Disney cheese fests.

I rented it but like a lot of popcorn movies this one has just enough going for it that I'll actually go ahead and buy it.
A great movie for when you just want to sit down for a while and zone out to a good fluff movie.

Good acting from the adults.

2772046,2,6303111920,"First things first, ignore anybody telling you this is a re imagining or a re-make of the original short.  The only similarities between the two is by name.  Aside from a reenactment of the short (which seems more like an in-joke than anything else) and some more subtle in jokes to the original film, the short and this film do not relate at all.  Remaking the original is ludicrous to begin with, and .  Instead of doing this, the Sorcerer's Apprentice is instead a film about a normal boy who happens to be of an ancient battle between good and evil sorcerer's (gee, does that SOUND FAMILIAR?!).  Fantasia is a treasured film of mine, in my top 3 of all time, so naturally I wasn't very enthusiastic at Hollywood tinkering with a classic into some shallow bloated special effects vehicle reeking with kitsch and summer shlock.  It was almost something out of a nightmare.  Well, I have to tell you, I didn't find it offensive at all, but it was so cliched, so tired, and so bland that I feel sorry for anybody who finds this to be one of the best movies he's ever seen.

You've heard about it all before.  Some kid happens to be the key for a life long struggle between some good and evil fight between some, and if he doesn't win, the world will be destroyed.  This kid is the key because some type of ring bonded with him, and now it's up to him to save the world from a couple of generic Wizards from fantasy 101.  He's an apprentice, you see.  This means that we will finally get to see him learn the ways of magic through training, which is about as fun as watching a Richard Simmons training video.  Meanwhile, he's trying too woo some pretty girl he knew ten years before (a coincidence?!?!), and blah blah blah.  Sounds really profound!  I'm sure going to get a lot of mileage watching this!.

I'll admit.  I wasn't going into this movie prepared to hate it, and I came out the same way.  Despite my appreciation for real art in the film medium, I enjoy ""entertainment"" films a whole lot, just as much as I do the former.  I liked the so called ""Speed Racer debacle""!  My favorite movie in 2009 was that horribly reviewed Transformers: (Easily one of the best action movies I've ever seen), it's safe to say I'm not an elitist jack@$$ who thinks entertainment and so called ""escapism imagination"" (yeah right) is worthless (In fact I can't live without it).  But in the end of the day, the film just didn't have a vision, and it ended up being a forgettable film with beyond tired summer movie cliches and cardboard performances, the cinematic equivalent of eating Styrofoam.

The characters here were absolutely bland.  Nicolas Cage and Alfred Molina play the tired wizard cliches, yawn inducing and boring beyond belief. Jay Baruchel's character is the typical geeky kid, and he is straight up BORING.  The INCREDIBLY hot Teresa Palmer, despite her looks, did not register at all.  Her character was extremely bland and there was absolutely nothing worthy of notice.  If there was a term to describe cardboard character, it would definitely be these characters, as they literately walk with the flatness and lifelessness you would get if a bunch of cardboard stand up figures got up and started to walk around and commence.

The love story, was just, uhhh.... where do I EVEN begin with this?  The relationship between the two characters was EXTREMELY hard to believe even for a tired and tear-inducing cliche of ""geeky guy gets hot girl"".  There is absolutely NO chemistry between and Palmer's character, and I had .  It was seriously as bad as mixing acids and bases together.  Words really can't describe how dreadful the love story was.  The acting and writing on this part was so incredibly bad it almost makes Megan Fox and Shia Labeoaf look like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  I'm not kidding here either, the writing on this part was THAT BAD, I found myself gritting my teeth and cringing at the cheesy dialogue and somewhat creepy affection this geeky kid had for a girl he met ten years later.  Never before have I seen such a Razzie worthy on-screen couple until I layed my eyes on The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

Also, what was the point of Monica Belluci's character?  As if the movie didn't need another corny love story.  She was pointless and the movie could have been run without her at all.  I guess it's for older people who want their own eye candy to our own Teresa Palmer.

If it weren't for watching Teresa Palmer (I have to admit, she's absolutely adorable and she can make a character very likable.  I hope she picks much better movies in the future), I couldn't have a clue why I sat through this, or at least to just finish the movie which I always try to do.  It's not as bad as The Mummy (don't get me started about that turkey) or anything like that, but it's nothing else but totally bland and generic.  Unfortunately, that also means that there nothing here that really is worth your time, and you're better off just watching Lord of the Rings again and look at for new things about the film.

After watching it though(on beatiful blu-ray high def) it is actually one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Disney pulls another great movie out of their thinking caps and casts it perfectly. Nicholas Cage is exceptional, and so are all the others. Everyone, I think, played the part great.

Overal the movie is great, but it does have some drawbacks. The begging is the story of all the sorcerers. It cuts off a little short leaving you a little lost at the begging. I know that if most people don't get the beginning, they ushually shut it off and watch something else. This shortness is not a huge problem though, I personally just wish it was longer.

I'm not gonna cover the movie in detail, that's already been done.
What's here is enjoyable.  This movie has interesting characters and good actors, plenty of special effects, and a fair soundtrack.
What was missing for me, was the rest of the story.  The plot jumps through what should be a much longer process in an unbelievable, disjointed, fast forward dive.
I liked the characters and would have routed for the hero to find his true potential and true love.  If they had given me the time to do it.  But no, we had to shoe horn into 109 mins. as many cool special effects, jokes, and car chases as we could.
Which is, evidently, what the viewing public wants, sadly.
Personally, I think Disney really missed the mark here.  I think a good chunk of the dissatisfaction with the main character and the lead actor is because he had no chance to grow. They took what could have been an epic and engaging series of films and wedged it into too small a package.  They could have built an entire film around ten year old Dave and the original concept of redoing the classic Micky Mouse scene.  Give young Dave at least an introduction to apprenticeship, and capped it off with Balthazar's disappearance.
And then come back and pick up the story 10 years later in a second film.
They could have, at least, added 10 mins. and a couple of time lapse montages to soften the disbelief.  I just didn't buy that total nerd transforms into Sorcerer Supreme in a couple of days.

Dave (Jay) is such a strange choice.  It is clear that director wanted laughs and humor from the actor's nerdiness.  I don't know if the actor is lacking or the direction was misguided, but all the supposedly funny moments were nearly unwatchable.  I am one of those people that doesnt like seeing others embarrassed.  Pretty much everything Dave did and said was nerdy in an embarrassing way, not funny/cute way.

2772067,4,6303111920,"I loved this movie.  Disney always has been expert at weaving the kind of magic that this movie exploits.  I just can't figure out why it bombed at the box office!!!!  Perhaps the modern cuts and edits and running time of one and three quarters hours cuts the full expression of the humanity of the characters a bit short...but in entertainment value it fits the bill in spades.  Cage and Baruchel match wits with Molina (aren't there any other villians out there these days???? Must it always be Molina?) in a fantasy filled world of magic fully realized on screen like Disney used to do.  It's got pathos, it's got young love, it's got Nicholas Cage's sly and worldly line delivery and to give him his due it has Molina's jaunty malevolence making mayhem for our two protagonists as well.  The much ballyhooed socerer's apprentice scene is too short to make a proper tribute but what there is is very well done.  Most importantly it is a great movie to watch with the kids.

The BLU-RAY transfer is really nice and the sound is great...a definite step up from the dvd...and I saw it in the theater and this looked just as good.

I hope this failure coming so close on the heels of Prince Of Persia (an entirely different story altogether) doesn't sour the relationship between Disney and Bruckheimer because I could see the melding of the two great action forces in hollywood could produce some real masterpieces with a little more attention to fleshing out the story.",1293667200,,1470,4.644787644787645

Is Nicholas Cage even capable of playing a character besides the ""wise mentor with a dark past"" at this point?

2772070,3,6303111920,"There is a subset of the comedy action genre that needs to be dubbed the pure popcorn adventure. This is the film that has no real substance, a great big budget and likable stars that we are pleased to simply sit through and then forget about as soon as the film ends. Disney's The Sorceror's Apprentice is one of these films, It is the Disney entry in the every major studio feels the need to make a Harry Potter like fim before its too late to do so trend. Does this make the film a bad one? Not really. The film is watchable for its entire length its just not something that you will remember within a few days of seeing it.

Nicholas Cage plays Balthazar Blake a contemporary of Merlin who is charged with finding a sorceror who can prevent the Rising. The Rising is an event that will occur if Morgana Le Fay is allowed to be reincarnated or released from a grimhold nested doll that she was trapped in. The Rising will lead to the end of the world as we know it and surely enough special effects to use the estimated 150M that this film cost to make.

Enter the picture Dave (Jay Beruchel) a nerdy twenty something that Balthazar is convinced is the prime Merliner. The Prime Merliner is is the only wizard powerful enough to head of the coming of the Rising that has been put into place by Balthazar's rival Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). The film than procedes to show us the training of the future wizard.

All of this confusing plot simply serves as a gateway for the film's special effects. There are huge set pieces involving car chases, flying statues, tesla coils and a remake of the famous mop scene from Fantasia. Add to this romance with the most beautiful girl in town Becky Barnes (Theresa Palmer) and we have what Disney would have predicted to be a huge hit. What Disney got in reality was an ok film that never really found its audience.

This is not a bad way to spend the evening and if the popcorn is hot can be quite fun. While not an essential own its a good rental that you can show to the kids with no problem",1293580800,,2038,4.31331592689295

The answer is yes, this movie is a little campy, but it also makes fun of itself and also adds a lot of humor for the older generations that will be watching this.  And, I think that with this movie, G-Force (to some degree) and the Pirates franchise (all of them Jerry Bruckheimer productions, I might add) Disney is reasserting its place in the modern movie landscape with classic stories that are designed to entertain and enthrall the whole family.

So, get this movie however you want, rent it, Netflix it, Amazon VOD, PPV or just buy the thing out right; however you choose to do it, it will instantly become a great family movie and help you to do something that is often so rare in today's cultural landscape, Family Time.",1293494400,,990,4.5139664804469275

For me, Disney movies seem to fall into just two categories: Really great and really stupid. Sorcerer's Apprentice hits squarely in the latter. Pity, too, because Jay Baruchel isn't horrible as the protagonist. This mess offers up a semicoherent plot with every kidcool contrivance the Disney execs can shoehorn into the movie--wizardly sorcerers, bolts of lightning, flying steampunkish gargoyles, Merlin, megacool cars, etc., etc.

Nicholas Cage stars as an ages-old protege of Merlin, seeking the new ""Merlinus"" (Baruchel) who will--well, it's never quite clear what he's supposed to do, but what he actually does is disobey orders and wind up sorta starting a wizard war all over again. Cage pretty much sleepwalks, almost as if he's embarrassed to wake up (don't blame him). He's (spoiler) brought back to life at the end of the film but if I'd been him I'd have insisted on staying dead, eliminating all chance of a sequel.

TSA also kicks in a few outdated and faintly insulting stereotypes, seasoned with plenty of ham-handed allusions to much better movies. The concept--that sorcerers employ energy and the untapped parts of the human brain to do stuff on a molecular level--is interesting, but they never really do much with it.

Though this was an excellent movie and he sure made it. The lead role of the kid was not the actor I would of wanted, yeah he had to be nerdy but it was hard for me to take any of his lines seriously because of his voice, though he give force a good effort. The special effects was amazing and the story was strong and really entincing, no weak spots in it for me. I would go on more about what it was about but the first review give it a full detailed. In an extremely tiny nutshell, the movie is about the sorcerer trying to save the world from ultimate evil and his only hope lays within this really hopeless, nerdy kid.

The special effects and fight scenes make up for some of this, but I just never found myself caring that much about what I was watching. The movie feels like it skips over things and rushes through too much to truly connect to it in almost any way. The character of the Apprentice is played in a way that makes you want to punch him in the face as much as see him succeed in becoming Merlin's heir. For Nicolas Cage, this is one more mediocre performance to add to his career. The people playing the evil characters were more interesting, but also not really used effectively. This movie should have been longer, or split into more than one movie to spread out the story more.

Nicolas Cage, who plays the sorcerer, groggily drifts through this movie. He looked like he was watching himself in this movie - bored. There are lots of magical special effects here, some are better than others but there is nothing really outstanding in this film.

2772089,3,6303111920,"This is a lighthearted take on an epic story of good and evil, that draws upon Arthurian legend to tell the story of a physics geek who's fated to save the world from an ancient evil.

Of course, since this is also a coming of age story aimed at teenagers, what he wants most is just to redeem himself from an embarrassing childhood nightmare, and win a date with the beautiful blonde girl he's always had a crush on.

There is a dark undercurrent to the backstory, of evil sorcerers bent on necromancy, who care little for the human lives that get in the way of their ambition.  Their effect, though, is to give an urgency to the story.  Appropriately, in a movie pitched at kids and teens, they feel more like the classic Disney villains, likable rogues you love to loathe, than like genuine incarnations of evil.

It's fun, for what it is.  The film reminded me a lot of a tamer version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cirque-Du-Freak-The-Vampire-s-Assistant/dp/B0030Y0I1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant</a>.  Still, it never feels quite like the epic struggle of good and evil it's made out to be.  There's none of the gravity, say, that you feel in the Harry Potter movies.  The most obvious problem is that the ""apprentice"" never really has a chance to be the apprentice.  Things happen too quickly, and the film tries to collapse too much of the development into a ""ten years later"" title card.  It could have been something like Karate Kid with dark magic - where you really felt the development, where in spite of being an awkward charmer it wasn't obvious he'd get the girl, there were ups and downs in the relationship, and you had a much clearer sense of the difficulty and extent of the magical training.  A few minutes of montage, that represents maybe a few hours' worth of training, is not enough to make credible the difficulty and danger of this kid's situation.

Still, the film's fun to watch.  It's escapist fantasy.  It looks good, it's lighthearted action adventure that looks good.  Nick Cage is perfect as Balthazar - cocky, eccentric, but not so eccentric as to steal the show.  Jay Baruchel manages to channel the right balance of geeky awkwardness and charm.  Alfred Molina's not quite as unhinged here as in Spiderman II - but he's always fun to watch in the role of a witty vilain.  This isn't on the scale of something like Pirates of the Caribbean, but if you think of this as a bigger budget version of some of the classic teenage mad science or magical comedies that Disney used to do, you won't be disappointed.  Young children old enough not to be traumatized by a few scary moments are likely to love it.",1292457600,,2724,4.817204301075269

2772093,4,6303111920,"So, basically, Jay Baruchel is... Mickey Mouse? THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE takes that famous sequence from FANTASIA, makes it contemporary, stretches it into an urban fantasy flck set in Manhattan. Jay Baruchel brings his damn goofy looks and his eighty pound frame and adenoidal delivery to the table, playing nebbish NYU physics student Dave Stutler who happens to be the long-sought successor to the most powerful sorcerer of them all, Merlin. Nicolas Cage, long-haired and scruffy, is Balthazar Blake, a sorcerer of the 777th Degree and one of Merlin's three immortal apprentices. The movie tracks Balthazar's frustrating mentoring of Dave (who is a frustrating kind of guy) and the two's attempts to defend Manhattan from dark sorcerers bent on casting the Rising, a vile resurrection spell. And, this being Disney, there's a cute girl for our nerd to platonically romance. Da kids will eat this up.

3.5 stars out of 5 for THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE. There are things to like about this movie. First, the special effects are stunning. As we learn in the Making Of featurette, a huge chunk of the razzle-dazzle is brought about by practical effects. It's one amazing visual after another, and a curious child could only hope to stumble into a dusty magical store like the Arcana Cabana. The forgotten subway station, where Balthazar and Dave set up training, looks really cool, as does that giant metal eagle. And you've heard that old saw - right? - about how science that is so advanced is essentially indistinguishable from magic. I really enjoyed the film's synthesis of magic and science, and how Dave applies his physics know-how and his tesla coils to perform magic. I wish we'd seen more of that.

There's acting pedigree in this picture. But that the presence of Alfred Molina (""Horvath"") and Monica Bellucci (""Veronica"") doesn't elevate the quality of the film more is disappointing, but Molina and Bellucci get cornered in those hackneyed roles. Nicolas Cage - who's been getting more and more wiggy these past years - is surprisingly likable here, largely because he tamps down those acting excesses. Don't get it twisted, he still comes off as daft in this flick, but he's easier to take in. As for the lead, Jay Baruchel, you're either exasperated by him or lauding his comic timing. I liked his repertoire of nerd humor in SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE. Here, I tolerated the guy. I think it's more the screenplay than Baruchel himself that made me all crabby. Also, Baruchel and Nicolas Cage demonstrate the awkward chemistry of, well, anyone and Nicolas Cage.

So see THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE for the urban fantasy elements and the special effects. The story itself mostly clips along at a brisk pace - until the scene which pays homage to FANTASIA bogs things down for a bit - but there's no arresting plot point here to make you sit up and really pay attention. And can we please put a moratorium on jokes about old man shoes? Besides those little nitpicks, I had a good time.

2772094,4,6303111920,"I will be kinder than many of the critics on this one.  yes, there were quite a few recycled ideas and plot themes, and the ending is certainly nothing new or surprising.  I did, however, enjoy what i thought was a fresh approach to the subject matter.  Balthazar's offhanded, non-chalant explanation of the sorecerer's position and the nature of his work was original and almost humorous:  It's largely just science.  Ok, yes, there is a certain, unquantifiable element of true magic here (which could stand some more explanation) but it got down to simple molecules, force, temperature, and all the other elements of physics.  I think the writers were going for a post-modern pitch at alchemy, and i think it worked.  ironically, a bit of a welcome departure for disney, which normally doesn't shy away from all the dyed-in-the-wool D&D fantasy ideology.  Another thing i found to be a major plus for this effort was the casting.  Jay Baruchel was a perfect choice for lead role.  His over-the-top geekiness coupled with the plot subject hit on all eight cylinders.  Alfred Molina took a slightly unusual role for himself, and it added greatly to the fun.  His sarcastic British wit and mannerisms added a lot of color to the scenery.  The other players made for an odd and original combination that had some good chemistry (he he).  There are also some great gags they pull off in the name of sorcery and magic - i like the Hungarian mirror trap.  Some of the scenery and action might be a little intense for younger minds, but, all in all, it's a fun family film.  I wouldn't mind picking this one up for keepers.",1292198400,2,1617,4.701067615658363

Jay Baruchel does his best to remind people that you don't have to be Shia LaBeouf to be completely irritating, unappealing or one-dimensional, Nicholas Cage continues (with an air of determined resignation) to play the exact same character he's portrayed in his previous 1,147 films, and Alfred Molina spends the entire movie gritting his teeth so hard, the audience can actually hear him mentally reminding himself to fire his agent.  Also, there's a peeing dog, a hot chick and a fat black guy to round out the requisite ""cast of clichs"" in this thrill-an-hour blockbuster.  Michael Bay would grunt approvingly.

Jon Turteltaub, director extraordinaire, ensures that you'll ignore the fact that Telsa coils do not work that way, sorcerers do not study spells or use spellbooks, ""Battery Park"" and ""Bowling Green Park"" are two different places, and no one in NY would ever use the word ""pop"" when referring to soda, by randomly jamming incongruous references to other movies into every scene; be on the lookout for ham-handed allusions to Star Wars, Indiana Jones and LOTR (not to mention riffs from other film scores) and editing the film in such a way as to make the audience forget that half the characters' actions are never fully explained! See if you can figure out why exactly the main character would need an army of mops to clean up one soda can and one pizza box, (""Unless it was because Disney dumped a boatload of money into my lap, and then threatened to break my kneecaps unless I shoehorned that scene into the movie!"" cries Mr. Turteltaub, alternating between wringing his hands maniacally and sobbing). Just sit back and jam some popcorn into your gaping maw as the film slumps to an exciting conclusion that will cause you to turn to whoever it was you managed to talk into seeing this movie with you and exclaim, ""Wait, what?""

If you only see one movie this year, then, well, quite frankly, you're probably the kind of person who would enjoy something like this in the first place...",1292112000,17,2386,4.869458128078818
2772097,4,6303111920,"Since this is a Disney film, I knew it would be a good, clean movie aimed at kids that is full of heroes, villains, and lots of action. I also knew that this film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and stared Nicolas Cage who both were part of the ""National Treasure"" franchise. I LOVED all of ""National Treasure"" films so I was really expecting a great movie.

Nicolas Cage plays Balthazar Blake, a sorcerer apprentice to Merlin the Magician from King Author fame. Merlin and Balthazar are betrayed by the sorcerer Maxin Horvath (played by Alfred Molina) who wants to destroy mankind. To save the world from doom, Balthazar imprisons Maxin and other evil sorcerers inside a Chinese nesting doll. Also imprisoned in the doll is Balthazar's one true love Veronica (played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci). Before Merlin dies, he gives Balthazar has sorcerer ring and tells him to find the one child that has the sorcerer power to save the world. Balthazar searches for centuries to find the child so that he can free Veronica from the doll. That child turns out to be Dave Stutler (played by Jay Baruchel) who is more science geek than powerful sorcerer.

The movie follows all the twists and turns of Balthazar teaching a grown-up Dave how to have confidence in this ability as a sorcerer and both of them trying to save the world from Maxin who Dave accidentally let out of the Chinese nesting doll. There are tons of actions scenes, magic duels, car chases and explosions - everything that a kid wants in a movie. My son loved the action scenes and he was cheering at the end of the movie.

For the most part I thought the movie was good. But for all the action in the film, the middle of the movie is boring and I kept looking at my watch to see when it would be over. That was surprising to me since I was never bored watching any the ""National Treasure"" movies. About 30 minutes of this movie could have been cut out and it would have been a much better film that would have been exciting from beginning to end. Also Jay Baruchel was good as the character Dave, but I felt I was watching him play the exact same nerdy role that he played in ""She's out of My League"".

""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is a good Disney movie that children and adults will like with lots of action and special effects. Just be prepared for a very slow middle that builds up to a great, exciting end.",1292025600,,2380,4.476958525345622

I think I've only seen Fantasia once all the way through, and I was probably around 6 or 7, meaning I remember next to nothing about it other than Mickey Mouse making household objects dance and clean stuff, the melody for that particular piece of the movie, and the fact that the entire thing was a musical. I will, however, admit I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan and have always liked him as an actor. And given his track record with director Jon Turteltaub and producer Jerry Bruckheimer over the last decade or so I was at least pretty excited to see what appears to be yet another addition to the seemingly increasing number of action/fantasy movies in 2010. The Sorcerer's Apprentice follows Balthazar Blake (Nicholas Cage) from the time of Merlin up to the present day where he was, at some point, supposed to find the Prime Merlinean - the one magician who would be destined to defeat the evil Morgana. In finding him, Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel) turns out to be the apparent successor to Merlin and must learn the ways of sorcery. Somewhere along the way Morgana's servant, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina) is on the loose and looking to free Morgana as well. For a PG-rated movie it's very lighthearted, but still manages to have a good amount of humor, just enough character empathy, and a lot of very well-coordinated action sequences. The fantasy element alone is pretty cool to look at and makes for a fun and adventurous kind of film, and I'm surprised it didn't fair as well during it's theatrical run. What I liked the most about it was the relationship between the ""crazy and quirky, but all-knowing"" master and his ""just wanna be normal, but really can't because he's not"" apprentice. It makes for some cute, fluffy situational humor here and there, but never loses site of the fact that it's still a simple good vs. evil story between magicians and their pupils. I thought Cage played the eccentric Balthazar very well opposite a convincingly villainous Molina. This is only my third serving of Baruchel's acting (outside of Tropic Thunder and How to Train Your Dragon), but he plays that nerd gimmick pretty well for what it's worth.

Video - 5.0

Being a newly-minted transfer, the picture is as pristine as can be. The best aspect to me is the sheer lack of noise in practically every shot. But despite the lack of noise, the film has a very, very fine layer of film grain that gives it something of a gritty, but also filmic and theatrical look.  Even in the shots of old Britain through the dark and drab lighting of Merlin's lair (at least I think that was his lair), detail is very sharp and easy to decipher amongst the shadowy look of the place. Black levels especially benefit from this giving off a great sense of depth and delineation in facial textures, costuming, and low-lit scenes. You can see all the lines and differences in brown and black between Balthazar's rawhide coat and black suit underneath, the scruffiness of his beard, the shagginess of his hair, the wrinkles on his face, and the objects within the shadows of Dave's lab. In terms of color, there's quite a bit of it throughout the film in the form of blue energy bolts, green, red, and orange magical flames, and so forth. But the best display, in my opinion, is the Chinatown scene. With a street parade carrying on, fireworks popping, and confetti falling all over the place (literally over a ton of it according the extras), the predominant color here is red (with slight hints of yellow), but it's never overly so and provides a very clear and immaculate sheen to the overall picture. Contrast is also perfect revealing lots of subtle textures and detail (as mentioned earlier about Balthazar) with somewhat of a warm hue to skin tones, but again, not overly so providing for a well-balanced color palette. Because of this CG-integration is very remarkable as well (as will be mentioned in the extras) making for a very believable and realistic presentation of all the film's special effects. It's a very clean picture and easy go-to reference material for friends and the yet-to-converted-from-DVD crowd. There are no absolutely no signs of aliasing, noise, edge enhancement, artifacting, dirt, or any of those bothersome video anomalies. Disney succeeds yet again in producing another stunning transfer with a movie that's every bit as deceptively enjoyable as people don't realize.

Audio - 5.0

The film starts off with a pretty good tease in the Jerry Bruckheimer logo imitating the sounds of the Tesla Coil lightning effects with a great deal of crackle and rumble. Dynamic range and separation are amazing between the narrator explaining the backstory and the on-screen action between Merlin, Morgana, and the rest of the apprentice gang. Magical explosions literally burst through the walls creating some awesome LFEs and bass. Chains clang, more magic is shot, and it goes into something of a musical montage to the almost-present day where we get to hear Jimmy Eat World's ""The Middle"" (which sounds pretty good in lossless) and kid-Dave reaches Arcana Cabana where some of the real effects start to break out. After the seal on Horvath's Grimhold is broken the crawling roaches forming his body and the thunderous footstep he takes will really wake you up. The actiony music picks up in tempo as they start exchanging hits and shooting energy bolts. There's an excellent amount of clarity in both high and low ends. The fronts do most of the work with music coming from the rears creating some nice ambience. Probably the best scene in the movie in terms of overall sound usage, though, (much like the video) is the scuffle in Chinatown. You've got a little bit of everything here from subtle directionality in the crowd noise dispersing through the four surrounds, audible dialogue from the center despite the chaos that ensues, a very healthy dose of LFEs from the dragon that chases Dave around, and a balanced level of volume between all of that and Trevor Rabin's adventurous score (you can even hear the falling confetti at the end of the scene). And this isn't even mentioning the Tesla Coil show or thrilling car chase later on. But the quieter moments have great subtitle to them as well, like when Balthazar is walking around and you can hear his jacket flapping, the weight and density of his old-man shoes as he walks around, the honking horns and squeaking of brakes in the city scape, crackling fires burning, the echo of subway cars, and so on. Like the video, there are no flaws to be found here either. Bravo to the sound team on both sides.

Extras - 3.5

We start off with ""Magic in the City,"" which covers the shooting of the film in New York to give it that contemporary and relatable fantasy feel. It shows them constructing sets from scratch, mixing it up with plate shots, and a lot of the coordination that was required for the Chinatown shot in particular. ""The Science of Sorcery"" attempts to set some logical grounds for the magic seen throughout the movie by applying real-life facts, talk about historical distortion, advancements of technology, the ever-changing interpretations of believability over the years, and how it's all supposed to tie in to the plot for a more realistic concept. ""Making Magic Real"" delves into the film's effects with most of the emphasis being on the fact that they tried to get as much of it in-camera as opposed to using visual effects and post-production CG. A lot of it was actually very physical and down-to-earth through the use of stringed props, wire-rigged stunts, air cannons, and various controlled apparatuses. ""Fantasia: Reinventing a Classic"" gives a little background on the project as a whole with interviews from mostly Bruckheimer and Turteltaub, but a few of the other cast and crew. It's more so reminiscence based on everyone's experiences and viewings of the classic short in the original Fantasia but shows how excited they were to be part of this particular piece of Disney canon and lore. ""The Fashionable Drake Stone"" takes a quick peek at the bizarre and ostentatious costuming of Toby Kebbell's character. I don't know what it is about his role in the movie, but I personally got this David Bowie kind of vibe (who ironically played Nikola Tesla in The Prestige, another magic movie, whose connection is made via the Tesla Coils in this film). ""The Encantus"" shows us a little bit of the design that went into the book of spells. ""The World's Coolest Car"" makes us aware that the Rolls Royce used in the movie was indeed Cage's one-of-a-kind. And then there's some fluff on the wolves and an assortment of some pretty funny deleted scenes and outtakes. All in all, not bad for an hour's worth. Would've liked a P-i-P or audio commentary, but still decent.

Overall - 4.5

This movie caught me by surprise. I was pretty sure the production values would be through the roof with Turteltaub and Bruckheimer behind the project, but I didn't expect to find the overall screenplay and script as fun as it turned out to be. Compared to the other contemporary-set title of this genre from the year, Percy Jackson, I think having star power like Cage and Molina made just enough of a difference to bump this into the next level of modern-day fantasy films. With a reference level A/V presentation and a pretty decent set of extras, The Sorcerer's Apprentice comes highly recommended.",1291852800,5,9384,4.797773654916512

2772105,2,6303111920,"Remember how annoying the whining, adolescence octave jumping voice of Jay Baruchel is for the character, ""Hiccup,"" in the animated movie, ""How To Train Your Dragon?""  Guess what.  He's in 2010's  ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" with Nicolas Cage, Alfred Molina, Monica Bellucci, and Teresa Palmer.  Jay Baruchel's voice is just as annoying, just as whining, and just as adolescence octave jumping; only this time we have to look at him too, and wonder how that voice goes with the most powerful wizard in existence anywhere in time since Merlin - who is still battling Morgan la Fey, since the days of King Arthur, right up to our present day.

Disney spent an estimated 150 million dollars making this movie, rated PG.  The portrayed type of magic is like Harry Potter, the story echoes ""Fantasia"" where Mickey dons the wizard's hat and makes the brooms and mops dance, the sets looked similar to BBC's  short-lived TV series, ""Demons,"" and the young star reluctantly becomes the hero in all of these named shows, including ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" with Jay Baruchel, including the wimp protg getting the best looking girl around.

The car chases aren't that different from ""Batman,"" or  ""Men In Black,"" and about all this movie has going for it is a few special FX efforts, but they are choked back until they become almost a cameo appearance.  Even Nicolas Cage's role in 2007's ""Ghost Rider,"" was better entertainment and better special FX.

""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" could have been far more developed, research should have included some noteworthy and at least interesting antiquity historically regarding Merlin and Morgan la Fey, or maybe the writers might try not to quilt this movie together from old hat, worn out, over-exposed story lines and situations too predictable even for Disney.  The good guys were no more civilized than the bad guys (and the bad guys weren't any more evil than the good guys) and yet allegedly they're fighting against each other to avoid or enable the worst evil destructive fate about to be released which will bring about the eternal annihilation of mankind.  Meh.  I've seen better fights between kittens.

Nicolas Cage prostituted his reputation and career to star in this film.  Obviously marketed almost exclusively to the pre-teen, or early teens viewing audience.  We don't need more movies that resurrect what we all wish would stay dead as far as re-makes or adaptations of cash cow  ""classics"" but with new faces.  It's like re-marrying the same woman for the fourth time and hoping for a different outcome at home.  Or going back to a job you've quit from, twice before.  Big surprise when you don't rise to the top?  I think not.

2 stars is generous from me for this movie, unless you're wanting a film that the entire family can watch and never find anything scary or shocking.  Milquetoast and less than lukewarm.  Worth seeing once maybe, but I sure wouldn't pay new price if I could buy it later on the discount or slightly used rack.",1291680000,3,2996,4.896825396825397

The young man, Dave (Jay Baruchel) is into physics and has constructed a massive electrical arc discharge machine using huge coils. Dave is destined to become the Prime Merlinian, which in effects makes him the enemy of Balthazar's arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina).

The action is embellished with lots of well done computer graphics. This unique aspect about this film is the way that physics  (High Voltage Electrical Discharges) and magic are woven together.

If you're going in thinking you'll be seeing Mickey Mouse, clear your mind.  This is live action and filled with Disney magic.  Nicholas Cage delivers a fantastic performance as Balthazar Blake, a sorcerer personally trained by Merlin.  Balthazar has spent the last millenium seeking for the one person that is capable of riding the world of the evil Morgana and her threat of overtaking the world with her undead minions.  His quest leads him to a normal, everyday (Bless you Disney) geek, Dave Stutler(Jay Baruchel).  Dave's a whiz kid that comprehends physics with a skill that makes me want to be his study partner in class, and is more than a little klutzy.  Goodness, watching him in his office made me want my own Tesla Coil!

When our unlikely pair meet in 2000, poor 10 year old Dave accidently breaks open a coveted nesting doll that contains the evil persona of  Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina).  How much more can a man be described as evil when his human body forms from a mass of slithering cockroaches?  Ten years later, Horvath is seeking to destroy Dave, discovering he is the one individual capable of bringing an end to any plans of world domination.

The battle of good vs. evil is on but, first, Dave has to learn how to perform the magic that remains hidden deep within him.  Reluctant, falling in love, and lacking self-confidence, Dave is a darling that makes the viewer laugh, groan in commiseration, and clap with glee when he succeeds.  Balthazar is the teacher that makes one shake their head, wondering where he gathers so much patience with what appears to be a hopeless case.  Harvath is slick, disgusting, but delivers an age-old charm that makes your skin crawl.

Overall, this is a good family movie.  It's a bit too in-depth for the younger set, but those between the ages of 10-16 will find it enjoyable.

2772123,3,6303111920,"Sometimes inspiration comes from unexpected places. If I remember correctly, not many people thought that a Disney theme park ride could be a huge hit franchise, but Jack Sparrow, pirate captain in the Caribbean, turned out otherwise. So it is only natural that Hollywood studios have made a new fantasy adventure film ""suggested"" by ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" eight-minute segment of the classic animated film ""Fantasia"" released in 1940. Well, the beloved Mickey Mouse tale is actually based on Goethe's poem, so why not make another one?

""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" starring Nicholas Cage as the sorcerer Balthazar Blake is a pretty well-made, if not very unoriginal, family-oriented adventure film. It is good clean fun like Cage's ""National Treasure"" franchise and in fact ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is helmed by Jon Turteltaub, director of two ""National Treasure"" films.

Skip the lengthy introduction about Merlin and three apprentices. Mostly set in 2010 New York City, the film's story is in short about the battle between the good magician and the evil one. Nicholas Cage is a good magician Balthazar, and Alfred Molina evil one Horvath. The evil magician wants to destroy the world as it is. The good one wants to stop it. The bad one enlists the celebrity ""magician"" Drake Stone (Toby Kebbell). The good one trains a college student Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel) as his apprentice.

Set-pieces of the magical battles are enjoyable, all finished with first-rate CGI techniques, but some interesting characters (Drake Stone, in particular) are sidelined by the action, and Monica Bellucci as Merlin's apprentice Veronica has little to do in the story. Also, there is a brief sequence of enchanted brooms, but the ""live-action"" version of the tale from ""Fantasia,"" amusing as it is, looks out of place in the storyline. The subplot about the young hero's childhood friend (Teresa Palmer) fares slightly better, though not as impressive as the romance of Peter Parker and Mary Jane.

Clich&eacute;-ridden as it is, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" is an entertaining family picture. Pretty good, if not great.",1282176000,23,2114,5.282738095238095
2772124,5,6303111920,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a mix of the television series Merlin, the Alchemyst book series from Michael Scott, and a dash of Doctor Who.  In this world, anything is possible through magic using science. However, it requires not one, but two different prologues to explain everything. This must be why the marketing department didn't bother to explain that the movie revolves around the mortal enemies of Merlin and Morgana le Fay. It was a very refreshing take on Merlin to kill him off in the first five minutes and set up Morgana for a present day awakening. Naturally, Merlin needs a successor but his personal ""sword in the stone"" takes the form of a ring: a dragon that sleeps until the day he meets the special boy that will defeat Morgana forever.

Enter, David Stutler, a screw-up kid who can't do anything right. Yet, who can resist a ten-year-old with a Buzz Lightyear alarm clock? Jake Cherry is well-cast and well-trained to mirror the mannerisms of Jay Baruchel, his grown-up counterpart who appears in the next scene. Baruchel first starred in the short lived television series, Undeclared. After nine years of being the co-star, his biggest role to date was the unseen voice actor for Hiccup in Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon. Here, he's the titular character and pulls it off, even though his hair does seem Ten-ish. (Or perhaps Tennant-ish would be the better term.)

Even more surprising was Nicholas Cage. His career seemed to have hit a creative plateau where his name was no longer a draw. Then, Kickass came along and reminded us why we liked him in the first place. His character is Balthazar Blake and was an apprentice of Merlin. For over a thousand years, he's lived to help save the world from the acolytes of Morgana and to find Merlin's successor. Usually, Cage appears too laid back, but here, even in silence you can see him acting whether it's the frown of his lips or the haunted look in his eyes. You can see the thousand years he's lived through and what it's meant to him.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice runs under two hours, but never appears too slow or too fast. The action only rests for a moment so the viewer can catch their breath before it picks up again: betrayals, double-crosses, dragons coming alive or the greatest car chase ever. There is never a moment to stop and let the audience's minds reflect on whether they need more milk in the fridge or if they ought to get new shoes.

The film is inspired by the cartoon short in Fantasia featuring Mickey Mouse which was in turn inspired by a Victorian symphonic poem by Paul Dukas. The required scene was done in a cute way that doesn't tarnish the original and there is a further reference if you stay through all the credits. This is the best film Jerry Bruckheimer has produced since the first two installments of Pirates of the Caribbean.",1281484800,9,2844,4.68
2772125,5,6303111920,"As far as movie quality goes, this would probably have been 4-star.  However, I rated it according to the descriptions given for each star level.  I loved it, so I rated it 5.
Because this is the first movie I've seen with ANY of the cast, I can't compare it to other Cage movies, other Baruchel movies, etc.  I enjoyed it on its own merit. [ETA: correction - after further research, I discovered that I have seen two other movies with Monica Belluci.  I just didn't recognize her.]
One quibble I have is the inclusion of the dog.  Was that really necessary?  Tank's only contribution seems to be as catalyst for juvenile bathroom jokes.  The movie would have been better off without such things.
The review title is ""A good start.""  That's because we're introduced to the characters and story, but we're left with a lot of unknowns at the end. I'd like to see more back story, especially of Merlin's three apprentices, perhaps revealed in the sequel hinted at after the credits.  There are so many possibilities for further development (of both story and characters) that this movie leaves me feeling like I've been introduced to a world just waiting to be explored.

2772126,3,6303111920,"Well, apparently fantasy movies are ""in"" these days (finally!) which means that I get more options that I'm pretty sure I'll find at least ""fun"" when going out to the movies. This time le film du jour was The Sorcerer's Apprentice, based loosely on the sequence in Fantasia  that uses music of the same title. Ironically, the first thing that the opening music brought to mind was the overture to Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream... And the visuals were pretty (as usual these days).

I suppose my major grumble is the oversimplicity of the plot. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it seemed a bit as if the filmmakers aimed for the 15-20 year old range, missed and landed right on target for someone closer to ten. This seemed a little incongruous with a protagonist of university age. Maybe I'm just starting to get old and jaded. The story is best summed up as ""nerdy boy with a destiny to save the world tries to impress cute girl in the process."" Not exactly the most clever of plots but I already groused about that. Magic is explained away as soft science electrical phenomena that sorcerers can focus through rings and innate ability. I would have enjoyed the plot better if Dave had been in high school or just starting college.

For the most part the characters are what made the movie for me. I liked the similarities between Balthazar and Dave in the ""lack of social skills"" department, although I felt that Nicholas Cage did a better job of his character overall (although I think someone in costuming had been reading a lot of Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden books). Dave's voice just grated on me the entire time and his character overall seemed to stray too far into the realm of cliche ""socially inept nerd."" It just felt like anybody who understood physics that well should have some concept that stuff that that involves big heavy books will require lots of studying. I also could have used a tie in for Becky in addition to her status as ""protagonist love interest.""Fortunately, everyone else was completely worth watching. The bad guys were fun and smart but rather ""meh"" in the motivation department (Seriously, why is ""destroying the world"" such a popular pastime? Do they all hate themselves that much?). If there had been more focus on Balthazar and Horvath I might have been more entertained over the course of the movie, if only because they were the major driving force behind the narrative and had most of the better lines.

I will admit that I laughed most of the times that I facepalmed and that the movie does have its moments. It seems very like a children's movie (despite the age of the main character) and it certainly does some banking on an older audience's nostalgia. It seems like a good rental film rather than an afternoon diversion though.",1281225600,,2789,4.685714285714286
2772127,2,6303111920,"This is definitely a summer movie, the kind to watch when the theater's air conditioning holds as much attraction as what's on screen. The special effects were specially effective, I have to admit, but the whiny, nasal nerd with the pompadour didn't do it for me. And, with that lab he had, I would have expected at least the dog to be named Igor. (Is Dave really the kind who'd keep sports equipment in his science sanctum?) That cleanup scene - well, a certain well-known mouse already owns that. Teresa Palmer did a great job being cute and saveable, but her big moment at the end just didn't fit her character all that well. And so on - there wasn't much actively wrong with the movie, just not much very right with it.

The audience, when I saw this, consisted largely of parents with kids in the 8-10 range. It was probably great for them (the kids, I mean). I could have passed on this one.

There is a descendant of Merlin in the present day (it turns out to be a small nerdy boy who grows into a geeky physics student) who will help one of Merlin's apprentices to defeat Morgana, a bad witch challenger to Merlin. In an earlier battle, she had been imprisoned but she intends to raise a cohort when or if she is released from the Grimhold - a prison made of concentric dolls.

What captured me about the movie was the great special effects - yea, I am a sucker for CGI - and the love stories included in the plot. The central plot of course is based on the age old fight of good against evil. In The Sorcerer's Apprentice, good triumphs in the end with the help of a little science, but it seems evill lives to fight another day. And of course, the geek gets the beautiful girl.

There is a weak homage to the earlier film with a series of uncooperative wet mops, but the rest of the story is calculated, hokey Arthurian legend, the patchwork result of three credited scriptwriters, Matt Lopez, Doug Miro, and Carlo Bernard, who play strictly by the clich guidebook.

The convoluted plot, such as it is, focuses on one of Merlin's apprentices, the noble Balthazar Blake, who must fight to save mankind from the evil machinations of Horvath, who of course, wants to destroy it. It's a grudge match that starts in 740 AD when Balthazar's lady, Veronica, gets stuck in a nesting doll called a grimhold with the malevolent Morgana le Fay. The action moves forward to Manhattan at the millennium where ten-year-old Dave Stutler meets the ageless Balthazar in an antique store. Complications ensue, as Horvath shows up and both mythical characters get locked into a vase for ten years. The story moves forward again to current-day New York with Balthazar finally freed and Veronica's liberation dependent on the discovery of an enchanted being called the Prime Merlinian. This turns out to be the now-twenty-year old Dave, a NYU physics student who epitomizes pure geekdom. Meanwhile, Morgana plans to gather an evil army to destroy the world when she gets freed. Dave also has a love interest in a comely student named Becky who has been his crush for the past decade.

As elaborate as the special effects are, they strike me as standard-issue and at times downright cynical with very little of a wow factor. The film is at its best only when Cage and Alfred Molina as Horvath are trying to outwit each other with competing feats of screen magic. It's a credit to both seasoned actors that neither embarrasses himself too badly in the superficial roles they accepted here. The same cannot be said for Jay Baruchel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>) who plays Dave as an excessive case study in constant awkwardness. The women fare even worse with Monica Bellucci and Alice Krige in barely-there roles as Veronica and Morgana, respectively. Teresa Palmer nicely underplays Becky, the girl of Dave's dreams, although her character's role in the climax is absurdly contrived. Leaden direction from Jon Turteltaub does little to offset the manipulative nature of this Disney-merchandise extravaganza, which by the end, leaves very little impact. In fact, I'm having trouble remembering it now.",1280880000,5,3513,6.094949494949495
2772130,5,6303111920,"Excellent movie!  Fun for all ages.  I don't remember anything that would preclude the kiddies from seeing it.  It's a story about magic, energy, and physics, and also about believing in your own abilities.

The story begins in Britain, 740 A.D., in the final battle between Sorceress Morgana and Sorcerer Merlin.  (Some of you may remember these characters from King Arthur and Camelot times.)  Morgana kills Merlin, but Merlin's apprentice, Balcazar, manages to trap Morgana in a Russian Nesting Doll, which they later refer to as the Grimhold.  (A Russian Nesting Doll is a doll painted on a closed vase.  There are several smaller and smaller dolls/vases within the doll on top, thereby creating a layered or nesting effect.  You often see Russian Nesting Dolls at multi-cultural craft shows.)  For over 1,000 years, Balcazar has captured evil Morganites (followers of Morgana) and trapped them in layers of the doll above Morgana.  The prophecy is that there will be a Prime Millennium (PM) (spelling?) who will come into the picture.  The PM will be the heir to Merlin's powers and only the PM will be able to kill off Morgana once and for all.  Balcazar must search for the PM until he is found, then train him in Wizardry.

Fast forward to the year 2000, we meet shy, somewhat nerdy 9 or 10 year old David on a field trip with his classmates.  Chasing a note from a pretty young girl, he finds himself in a very strange shop in New York called the Arcana Cabana, alive with weird and scary relics of a time long forgotten.  It is in this shop that David meets Balcazar (Nicholas Cage), and Balcazar recognizes David as the PM.  The ""stuff"" starts happening that day and scares the heck out of David.

Fast forward another 10 years and our hero is now about 20.  David is a physics nerd in college and he is darned good with physics and electronics.  Just as David THOUGHT the old experience was over, Morganite Horvath comes after David looking for the Grimhold while Balcazar comes to help David and protect the Grimhold.  You see, Horvath wants to free Morgana, so Morgana can bring the evil dead to life and take over the world! OMG!

We have lots of adventure as Balcazar tries to teach David the Wizardry he needs to know before it is too late.  (Actually, David already has the ability within him.  Balcazar just has to re-awaken David and help David find the belief in himself that he CAN do it.)  I especially love in the early learning stages, when Balcazar says to David in a calm voice, ""David, you should run.""

Synopsis
One of Merlin's three apprentices, Morgana, steals a spell that can raise the dead before murdering Merlin. One of Merlin's other apprentices, Balthazar, is tasked with finding Merlin's heir as he will be the one to defeat Morgana and save the world...

Review
Nic Cage pulls off yet another creepy role (his ability to portray a man that you would never want around your child is simply amazing). The movie manages to have a very Jerry Bruckheimer feel, a perfectly fluffy popcorn movie with an overly dramatic soundtrack and some overly cheesy slapstick moments. This movie is mostly action, with a little bit of plot stuck in between the action sequences. So if you're looking for a fairly good movie that won't make you think, this is the movie for you.

My Recommendation
The one and only reason that I recommend seeing this in the theaters is that the effects look great on a big screen. Some of the magic is simply lost when it's moved to a TV... Plus, it's kid friendly so it's a good break on a hot summer day.

2772134,5,6303111920,"Dave was your typical ten-year-old until one fateful afternoon on a field trip when he passed a note to his crush. The note was swept up in a gust of wind and through a series of odd coincidences ended up inside a shop. It was in this shop that Dave met Balthazar, who informed Dave that he is a sorcerer.

Fast forward ten years and Dave is now a socially inept physics geek. Balthazar reenters Dave's life and tells him he needs to begin his training. Dave quickly realizes he's caught up in a centuries-old rivalry that could result in the end of the world- and he is the only one who can prevent it. Balthazar quickly tries to train Dave so they can battle the forces of evil that are trying to destroy the world.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice is an exciting and entertaining film for the whole family! It has a little of everything in it- action, magic, humor and romance! The characters are funny and interesting (everything from geeky Dave to the greatest wizard ever known, Merlin). The content is family friendly so you can enjoy it with the kids, but it's exciting enough to be a great movie for adults as well. I enjoyed the acting, and everyone did a spectacular job! There were quite a few familiar faces- Nicholas Cage is fantastic (as always) and Jay Baruchel once again shows that he is a pro at portraying the painfully awkward guy! Alfred Molina is also present, and plays a great villain! There are also many new faces- Toby Kebbell is showing us that he is an extremely diverse actor, one moment he's playing a rugged Persian prince and the next he's an egocentric magician!

One of the things I love about this movie is that Disney gives a nod to some of its past endeavors (Hint: think of a character by the same title and you'll have an idea of what I'm referring to). Subtle homage to various films and characters can be seen throughout the movie, providing what computer geeks would refer to as ""Easter eggs"" for the viewer to catch. Some are relatively obvious, but if you're like me, you'll have to brush the cobwebs off of your memories of some of the older Disney flicks!

I also love that the trailers didn't ruin every funny scene. There were many other parts of the movie that made me laugh! This movie has plenty of surprises, and it keeps you engaged for the entire length of the film. The soundtrack is also excellent, with fantastic compositions from Trevor Rabin. His music sounds like a cross between Klaus Badelt's Pirates of the Caribbean score and Steve Jablonsky's Transformers score, with a few distinct touches of his own. The primary song repeated throughout the film is OneRepublic's ""Secrets"", which I feel was an appropriate song choice!

The movie is a bit predictable, but it's not as if you can expect otherwise from a Disney film. Some of the characters weren't incredibly well developed, however I don't feel it detracted from the film. To have gone into the details of every character would have made the movie too long. Regardless, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone! So, if you're in the mood for something a bit more action packed, definitely consider this one! Also, if you tend to be a film score junkie (like me), you should definitely consider grabbing the soundtrack! It's got some great tracks!",1279411200,119,3265,4.612736660929432

First Impressions:

I liked the start!  Showed promise of history, Merlin and his apprentices against the forces of Darkness.  The betrayal of one of these apprentices and one of them, Balthazar (Cage) begins a thousand year search for The Prime Merlinian, the guy who will have the power of Merlin and will be the destruction of Merlin's enemy, Morgain Le Fay.

We see a few scenes of Balthazar searching for the one who will be the magician of magicians.  And we're told that he is capturing those who have evil magic (Morgainians) and how he's trapped them in a doll-like thing called a Grimwald.

Pretty good, huh?

Yeah, after that, well....

Potential Lost

I can't believe how many ideas can be all crammed into one film and none of them are developed to any degree.  Best to list a few that stand out:

Love triumphs over evil and comes out on top.  Old hat but useable plot device.  Not developed.  Balthazar's girl is in a doll.  David (the soon to be apprentice) also has a love interest in Becky (a blonde he had a crush on in the fourth grade -- long story).  Didn't work for me.

Car chases.  A Rolls Royce turns into a speedy race car in a car chase.  OK, fine.  I can deal with that.  But then the bungling apprentice turns the car into a 1973 Pinto.  Hey, perfect joke here to make it blow up!  Nope.

Pop Culture Allusions:  Very bad.  These aren't the droids you're looking for indeed!

Betrayal of Friendship:  This had potential, but again not developed.  The bad guy used to be the best friend of Balthazar and now walks  on the dark side.  No discussion, no changing minds, nothing.  I've seen better.

The Anti-Apprentice:  This had potential too.  One Drake Stone, a magician who actually has real power and is a Morganian.  Does the bad guy teach him?  Get his character developed to be a real threat?  No!

Fantasia Flop!  The homage to the original Mickey Mouse cartoon Fantasia where Mickey makes the mops clean up and the buckets of water flood the place is not too badly done.  David makes a mess and cannot control them.  He then blows off Becky and says he's having issues.  Really?  Balthazar comes back and scatters the waters.  Then he scolds David on his abuse of power.  Yeah, so?  Mickey was better.  And you never seen him treat Minnie like that!

Any good points?  I did enjoy the beginning of the film with its Merlin mythos (lasts ten minutes).  I also enjoyed David's use of physics to achieve his goals as well as his power.  This was played up and developed at least.

The Credits:

The music track is not half bad!  I would not mind getting a CD of the soundtrack of this film.

After Credits:

There is an after credit scene that hints to a sequel.  Doubtful!

Bottom Line:

And Alfred Molina as the bad guy, former friend, Maxim Horvath, is as creepy and evil as ever, though is Doc Octopus in Spiderman 2 was much better acted.

Additonally, Jay Baruchel plays the clumsy, bumbler fairly well as David Stutler -- but the character is not developed enough for the audience to even care!

Bad allusions to great cultural icons.  David, a loveable physics nerd, becomes David, a clumsy physics nerd with a few magic tricks.  Nicholas Cage walks through is parts with little emotion and looks like he's trying to pass a magic wand.  And the toilet humor, please!

2772137,4,6303111920,"My only quarrel with The Sorcerer's Apprentice was that it was too short to fully develop some of the characters (avoiding spoilers here).  Otherwise, it's a fun summer romp with one of the best car chases I've seen in a long time.  The story is about Balthazar Blake's quest for the Prime Merlinian.  As one of Merlin's three original apprentices, it's been up to Blake to find the person who possesses the potential to achieve Merlin's magical prowess.  He finds nine-year old Dave, but there's a ten year lapse in their acquaintanceship.  When they finally meet up again, Dave is a nerdy NYU physics student.  As the reluctant Dave's apprenticeship begins, there are obstacles in the form of Maxim Horvath, his tattooed sidekick Drake Stone and Dave's burgeoning love affair with Becky.  There's also the evil Morgana Le Fay who plans on world domination if given half a chance.

The cast is small but strong.  Standouts are Jay Baruchel who keeps Dave's nebbishness from caricature, Alfred Molina whose Horvath has a nice sense of entitlement and Toby Kebbell's Drake Stone.  I've had a love/hate relationship with Nicholas Cage for a while, unbeknownst to him.  At his worst, he's depressed and weird, at his best, he's warmly eccentric.  I'm happy to report that in this movie, he's the latter and makes Balthazar sparkle.

The plot is not especially original, but does contain a couple of twists, focusing more on relationships than on the actual magic though there are some pretty cool special effects.  Deep, this movie isn't, but it is fun with some wonderful comic moments, not the least of which is the homage to Paul Dukas' original music as illustrated in Disney's Fantasia.  The movie borrows from some other famous franchises, too. Spiderman, Harry Potter and the Mummy all make contributions, but The Sorcerer's Apprentice winks at the audience and manages to make the cliches fresh.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice is an homage to Dr. August Coppola, Nicholas Cage's father, who taught film and died last October. I think Dr. Coppola would have liked this movie. I certainly did.",1279152000,53,2092,4.968390804597701
2772138,4,6303111920,"My husband and I were looking forward to seeing the Sourcerer's Apprentice with great enthusiasm, as we enjoy good magical videos and really like Nicholas Cage.  The movie was interesting and has some cool special effects.  However we both felt that it centered too much on romance and not enough on the training of the sorcerer's apprentice.  If you like romances then this is a must go.  If you're into magic, the romance outweighs the magic.",1279152000,2,444,4.802631578947368
2772139,3,6303111920,"""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" was made to accommodate the attention spans of the age group it's intended for. It doesn't have much of anything in the way of plot or character development, but it has plenty of action and lots of dazzling visual effects for children and young teenagers to gawk at in amazement. Watching this movie, I thought back to the first time I saw ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" another fantasy film that relied heavily on action and special effects; yes, but it also told a story, and the characters were wonderfully defined, and the visual effects felt genuinely magical. For ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" the effects zooming around the screen seem to be nothing more or less than a marketing gimmick for packaged products. Can't you just see the action figures and play sets this film could inspire?

The title is, of course, a reference to the most famous animated sequence from ""Fantasia,"" in which a robed Mickey Mouse dons his master's magic blue hat and unintentionally wreaks havoc by bringing brooms to life. The film ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" pays tribute with a live-action version of this scene, mops and buckets and spray cleaners flying all around and sloshing water all over the floor while the soundtrack plays a newly orchestrated rendition of Paul Dukas' score. Aside from the fact that today's children are unlikely to know of such a film as ""Fantasia,"" this scene lacks the charm and wonder of the original animated sequence, in all likelihood because the aim was to be funny instead of magical. Indeed, the filmmakers regard this movie not as an adventure, but rather as a challenge to make every scene as funny as possible. Some moments naturally lend themselves to comedy, but others simply don't require the insertion of a joke.

The film opens, as many fantasy films open, with an exposition-crammed prologue the target audience is likely to ignore, save for the visual effects. We learn that, thousands of years ago, the wizard Merlin had three apprentices, one of whom was a traitor. Of the two loyal apprentices, one sacrificed her well being to entrap an evil enchantress; they, along with the traitor, were then imprisoned in a device made to look like a wooden stacking doll. A dying Merlin entrusted his remaining apprentice, now a master sorcerer and apparently ageless, to search the world for a protg who can carry on the traditions of magic. A montage reveals, mostly by costume changes, that this sorcerer searched for this special someone for centuries.

Flash forward to the year 2000. In New York City, a ten-year-old boy on a field trip named Dave Stutler (Jake Cherry) wanders away from his group and stumbles upon that most reliable of fantasy film clichs: The out-of-the-way antique shop no one ever seems to visit. Inside, he meets the ageless sorcerer, named Balthazar Blake (Nicholas Cage), and while the earlier montage showed him neatly dressed in suits appropriate to the era, he now looks like a bum in a black raincoat, his hair greasy and unkempt, his face stubbly. When presented with a special ring, Dave shows every sign of being the successor Balthazar has been looking for. But before anything can become of it, Dave accidentally breaks open the stacking doll, releasing the treacherous apprentice, whose name is Maxim Hovarth (Alfred Molina), who carries a cane and dresses like Oscar Wilde's evil twin.

I will skip a number of tedious details and flash forward to the present day, where a twenty-year-old Dave (Jay Baruchel), now a college physics student who's really into Tesla coils, reunites with Balthazar and reluctantly agrees to be his apprentice; they must stop Hovarth from unleashing dark forces that would raise an army of the undead to take over the world. It's always about saving the world, isn't it? Perhaps if Dave had gone beyond the conventions of a nerdy caricature, this might not have bothered me. Alas, he's so thinly developed that he seems like a dweeb even when he makes magic balls of light appear out of thin air. There's no sense that somewhere deep within is a hero waiting to emerge; if this were any other fantasy, he would be the comedy relief, not the main character.

Interspersed within sequences of training and fighting - all related to magic and, strangely enough, science - is a completely unnecessary subplot involving a college student named Becky (Teresa Palmer), the one girl Dave has had a crush on ever since the fourth grade. For someone who has never seen magic before, she's remarkably understanding and supportive of Dave's abilities. She didn't feel appropriate. She felt like a contrivance, an excuse for the obligatory damsel in distress to be worked into a fantasy. But never mind that; Palmer and Baruchel have absolutely no chemistry, so it wouldn't have mattered what either of them said or did because they shouldn't have been cast together in the first place. ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" may be a decent sight and sound spectacle for younger audiences, but making the story and the characters work would have required a rewrite, with a little help from a real act of magic.",1279065600,2,5125,4.927083333333333
