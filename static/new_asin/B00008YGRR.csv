1867012,5,B00008YGRR,"Recalling the depature of David Caruso, it seemed at the time that NYPD Blue was a lost cause.  But just when things looked bleak, along comes Jimmy Smits to put his stamp on the show and help take NYPD Blue to a whole new level.
The turnover is handled superbly (and explained on the commentary for the episode ""Simone Says"" by David Milch) with Bobby Simone crossing out Kelly's name on the locker and writing in his own while the always excellent Dennis Franz (Andy) complains to the Lieutenant that this just can't possibly work out after one ""how ya doin'?""
The entire set is great with the last episodes of John Kelly leading off the season.  The set is packaged well and includes a few extras and insightful commentaries.
Why NYPD Blue RIP at the top?  Because the idiots at Fox did not make enough money on the release of seasons one and two and appear in no hurry (and probably unlikely) to release any other seasons!  Disappointing to say the least.  There should be someone to complain to.",1087516800,51,1000,4.533333333333333
1867013,5,B00008YGRR,"Bought this the day it came out.  Watched all the episodes within two weeks.  I need more Blue.  Please Fox, release the other seasons.",1085529600,3,135,4.541666666666667
1867014,5,B00008YGRR,"NYPD Blue is one of the best police dramas ever made! What really impresses me is David Caruso is on the first 4 episodes of the 2nd season. It is sad that he left the cast after the 4th episode of season 2, but I found Jimmy Smits to be a very good replacement! The acting is just like real police detectives on this show. This show and ""The Shield"" are the two best police dramas ever made in my opinion. I highly recommend both of these DVDs if you are a big fan of police shows!",1076630400,11,482,3.979381443298969
1867015,5,B00008YGRR,"When do we get season 3? I'm trying to be patient, but it's really hard. This is the edgiest, grittiest cop drama in television history. I want more Blue!!!",1071100800,9,156,4.413793103448276
1867016,5,B00008YGRR,"By now we all know that David Caruso's character of John Kelly exits in the 4th episode of Season 2.  Like many NYPD Blue fans, I hated to see him go.  Smits stepped in immediately after and he was also very good, but the dynamics of the show would have to change.  I didn't like Bobby Simone at first, but that was probably because I was sad to see Caruso leave.  But the episodes remained gritty and intense, and Smits soon hit his stride.  All was well in the precinct again.  The downside to Season Two was the introduction of Kim Delaney to the cast near the end of the season.  I still contend that she is and was the weakest actor in the run of the series.  I'm afraid that her inclusion as a series regular is off-putting enough for me to not purchase any further season box sets that she appears in.  I'll start buying them again when Rick Schroeder's character of Danny Sorensen comes in and Delaney's role is reduced and eventually eliminated.
The commentaries included in this box set are interesting though not quite fascinating, and the so-called ""documentary"" is just an episode-by-episode series of recollections by the principle cast.
All in all, a good purchase.  You get 22 great episodes, Caruso's most complicated and dramatic character story, and precious little of the Diane Russell character.",1064534400,14,1316,4.682608695652174
1867017,5,B00008YGRR,"If you follow the show on tv, you'll understand how every time Andy loses a partner, you don't believe someone else can fill the void.  Each of his partners have a different relationship with Andy.  John Kelly tried to steer him in the right direction and keep him out of trouble. When Kelly leaves, Bobby fights to win Andy over and to help him overcome his alcohol addiction.  With Bobby's death, Andy is determined not become attached to another partner, but can't help seeing in Danny the many similarities to his late son.  After Danny is murdered, Andy's guilt almost doesn't allow him to get close to Clark, but Andy now finds himself in the role of father figure to ""Junior"".  Each partner has enriched Andy's life and made him the strong character he has become.  Andy's partners can come and go, castmembers will be replaced and interchanged but Andy is the core of the series and this disc set is just more proof of the many sides of Andy Sipowicz.",1062720000,6,959,4.578947368421052
1867018,4,B00008YGRR,"N.Y.P.D. Blue Season 2 is still a good show without David Caruso but it lacks the magic sparkle that the 1st season has. There are many guest stars who went on to become big stars : Michael Imperioli ( 'Christopher' on ""The Soprano's ),Peter Boyle ( the monster in ""Young Frankenstein"" movie)and more guest stars- but without David Caruso's character providing the sexy romantic luster =this is just a good cop show. How they thought that the high pitched voice and dull lack of appeal of Jimmy Smits could ever replace Caruso is a big unanswered question. If you want to see why this program became a hit- buy Season 1. If you want to just see a good police program with good guest stars- this is your season to buy on dvd.",1061596800,11,724,4.451127819548872

Today I decided to rewatch the series for like the 10th time only to discover its not free on prime anymore. I am so upset! The main reason I signed up for prime 2 years ago was so I could watch NYPD Blue and now I can't unless I want to pay....and I don't! I already dished out $100 for prime, the least they could do is let us watch shows that are no longer on the air, be included with prime for free.

1867438,4,B00008YGRR,"NYPD Blue is gritty, but not a realistic crime drama (not sure there has really ever been one done for TV). It is fun, well directed, loaded with dated social commentary on racial relations, sexual tolerance, etc. It comes with a small army of at the time little known actors showing up for short stints as perps, victims, witnesses and NY diversity. Dialogue is deliberately stilted, with most of the inside humor coming off facial expressions. Plots are pretty much just an excuse to chart the rehabilitation of Detective Andy Sipowicz, one of the more unlikely protagonists in TV history, with most of the other characters sub plots eventually intersecting his journey. Gratuitous shots of nudity are deliberately infused to challenge the FCC and to give it some of the ""in your face"" edge one of its producers (Milch) insisted on giving it. At times it tries too hard to make its social case, with Sipowicz's emotional stability being fractured too easily at times to make the point of the episode, but generally not a bad 48 minutes of TV per episode.",1461024000,,1056,4.8076923076923075

1867580,5,B00008YGRR,"Now that we've seen The Wire, it's worth revisiting NYPD Blue to see if it has stood the test of time. It has. The show stands with Homicide, The Wire, and the original first several seasons of Law & Order as one of the best American cop shows of all time.

The less good:
While NYPDB does get a bit too soapy for my taste sometimes with the personal drama outside the precinct building and crime scenes, that is indeed a taste thing. Along these lines, I grow weary of the sex scenes, which at the time were quite something for network television, but which only very rarely add anything substantive. That said, this content does not subsume the rest of the show, and some of the personal drama does in any case flesh out the characters in some interesting ways.

The great (which far outweighs the above foibles):
The show's strengths rest in the dialogue, fantastic acting, pathos (especially with Dennis Franz, both the actor and his character as written), and, for the most part, really excellent casting of tertiary characters (Paul Ben-Victor in the Season 2 episode, You Bet Your Life, is just the best of the best - really wonderful). We have grown accustomed to gritty realism in cop dramas, but NYPDB (along with Homicide: Life On the Streets, which was developed around the same time) was a real path forger in this respect.",1458691200,,1336,4.632911392405063

1867670,5,B00008YGRR,"Sipowitz and Simone are a great acting pair, both great in their own right, but much better when combined. It's a nice alternative to having a single star that always has to be perfect. The play the classic good cop / bad cop to a tee.

Some might find the language a bit rough, but it comes across as genuine for the period. I could do without some of the sex, but typically its at the end and skipping though those parts takes nothing away from the story (unless you are watching solely for the sex)

Really like the Amazon videos- both the delivery format ( I have prime membership) and more so that there are no commercials.

The 1st five seasons are classics - great for those of us that followed the series when it was running originals.

His tough guy, wise cracking ways...back in the day when men couldn't/ wouldn't show their feelings. A mans man. His portrayal of alcoholism is spot on...the show touches on subjects back then were meant to be kept in the ""closet"". My third round of watching all 12 seasons.",1453507200,2,598,4.396396396396397

As I am very pro Prime for NYPD Blue I am disappointed with Prime's handling of Blue Bloods.  We have enjoyed watching it as well but after the first five seasons now Prime wants us to pay for future seasons.

At times I would have rather seen the butt, or side view of a woman's breast then the baby shot in the head, or the violence  that drains you of caring. So I'll watch NYPD Blue, looking to join in the story of Dennis Franz finding the little girl he could not in an earlier episode  find but who is alive and well and getting a second chance to return her to her parents.

Jimmy Smits enters in season two,  in the the role of Detective Bobby Simone, fills the gap quite nicely, but Dectective Kelly is still missed. The constant is the outstanding performance by Dennise Franz, whose portrale of Dective Andrew Sipoitze, is seconded to none.

Now I had seen all of the first season and knew from reading others reviews that some changes in characters were coming in Season 2 - I had started watching Season 3 and knew there were gaps... This is a Great Show and even though the crimes are solved each episode, there is an ongoing story line that makes it more interesting to watch in sequence.  That's what keeps you coming back.. just to see what happens next.  And the change in the star character only makes the show better.  Det. John Kelly was good but Det. Bobby Simone is Great!  I hope to keep watching each season - every episode!",1435276800,,714,4.3059701492537314

The storylines are interesting and believable, the writing is great, the acting is superb.

It's just too bad that David Milch was an intolerable and unbearable drunk that caused Smits to leave. Unfortunately, they wrote him out of the show in the most heartbreaking manner possible that made it impossible to bring him back after Milch sobered up.

Too gritty, too dark, and very different from the current tv of the time.  Now that I'm older, it's amazing how much I've enjoyed watching the show.  The writing is excellent, the original cast was superb, and am enjoying the seeing parts of New York that are new to me.  Occasionally too much skin showing, but the writing is so good, I can get past that.  At least it's not pornographic as some of the series are today!  If you haven't watching NYPD in awhile it's worth a repeat, if you've never seen it before, definitely worth taking a look at.  Was really disappointed when David Caruso left, but Jimmy Smit seems to be doing ok.  A great series that is very entertaining.",1428883200,,790,4.514084507042254

Please leave the series on Prime because I just finished season two and  have 10 more seasons to go.  I'm watching as quickly as I can.

I began watching Everybody Loves Raymond as a Prime program and before I could complete the series, it was removed as a Prime program.

Even several of the one or two episode characters can bring one to tears. The filming brings New York City and it's police and detective work to life in a way that few shows do. There is such drama of course, mixed with laugh out loud humor. Some subjects covered are not for the faint of heart. Definitely not a show for kids to watch.",1424995200,,514,4.364583333333333

David Caruso was great, and although he hurt his career by leaving the show after 26 episodes, it is difficult to see how he could possibly have taken the John Kelly character any further.  In Dennis Franz's first season as Andy Sipowicz, he lays the foundation of one of the greatest television characters of all time.",1420416000,,450,4.818181818181818

1870496,5,B00008YGRR,"As I have said with each season of NYPD Blue, this is the best hour-long drama that was ever broadcast on commercial television.

This is the year we lose John Kelly (David Caruso) to some vindictive higher-ups and get introduced to Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits), and the show really begins to hit its stride.  The rapidly blooming respect that Simone earns from Sipowicz quickly translates into a deep friendship, as Sipowicz's relationship with Sylvia Costas has its ups and downs.  The late, great Peter Boyle has a recurring role as Sipowicz's AA sponsor Dan Breen, and comes to a bad end at the hands of his schizophrenic son, with whom Andy has a strange rapport.  And of course there is always the saga of Medavoy and Donna, and Donna's intensely sexual sister Dana (Debra Messing).

But I would like to say something about watching this on Amazon Instant Video.  The quality of the reproduction on Amazon is head and shoulders above what it was on the Shoutcast DVDs.  On the DVDs I get some printthrough-style ghosting and a lot of graininess, but on Amazon the picture is consistently crystal clear, although the video controls are a bit idiosyncratic and the system sometimes seems to crash a bit every now and again.  It is very nice that this series is part of the ones that are free to Amazon Prime customers.",1419724800,,1320,4.708695652173913

Then Jimmy Smits joined the show as Andy's partner, a more compelling character and I liked him even better. This series holds up remarkably well and is even more fun this time around because the guest stars are sometimes people who hit it big after being unknowns here--Debra Messing, Anna Gunn, and Michael Imperioli, to name a few. Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is still one of the most righteous and believable police characters ever. The production values are the best.

1870664,5,B00008YGRR,"NYPD Blue is a great program  - I don't know why we didn't follow it during its original run.  There have been a lot of good cop shows over the years, but NYPD Blue stands out because of its consistency - every episode is good, not just one here and there. Dennis Franz gets second billing, but he is the real star of the show with his tough guy/soft guy personna. Each character has their own story going on and that is a big part of what makes the show interesting. The NY setting is also key to the show's gritty feel as they show some of the worst and some of the best of New York. If you are looking for a happy, light cop series, NYPD Blue is definitely not it.",1416441600,,667,4.007518796992481
1870665,5,B00008YGRR,"This series is one of the best series in the history of television for sure. No wonder it ran for so many years. I enjoy it now just as much as I did back in the 1980's. I gotta think it did at least something in the way of supporting the image of the NYC Police Dept. There is not much in the way of corruption depicted within the Dept in this series and the characters were always presented in both their valorous and also flawed very human aspects as well. Dennis Franz did such a fantastic job in his role as Detective Sipowicz the war veteran recovering alcoholic. I especially enjoy the snide, sarcastic yet comical remarks his character made all through the series. I have to admit that I was very disappointed when Dennis Caruso left the show after season one. His character was always very interesting and entertaining to observe, but was rather appealing also. Jimmy Smits did do a great job of replacing him however. At this time I still have not re-viewed any episodes beyond season 2 so I cannot comment beyond that point, but I seem to recall that it continued to be an excellent series year after year. ...... ""Hill Street Blues"" was another good and rather similar series at that time. If you enjoyed that one you probably also enjoyed or would enjoy NYPD Blue.",1416441600,,1277,4.484978540772532

1870804,5,B00008YGRR,"I have enjoyed NYPD Blue since it debut September 21, 1993.  I just saw Season 2 last week so it is fresh in my mind. Episodes 1-4 was the END of David Caruso as John Kelly.  Since I knew it was coming I was just glad to get beyond the ""John Kelly"" character.  He was an outstanding actor during his stint at NYPD Blue.  Too bad he decided to shuffle off down the road.  However, NYPD Blue didn't miss a beat.  I have always felt that Dennis Franz (Andy Sipowicz) was the main character since day one.  Season 2 remains one of the top seasons in NYPD Blue because their cast was outstanding, the plots were complex but not too complicated and the dialog was just like perfectly ""New York !""  There is a small element that links episode to episode but it is not necessary to enjoy the individual episodes.  NYPD Blue Season 2 is one of the best seasons because Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is generally happy, Bobby Simone's (Jimmy Smitts) character blossoms, Gail O'Grady (Donna Abandondo) colorfully dominates the house scenes and Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) is a welcomed breath of fresh air.

1870962,4,B00008YGRR,"As old TV series go, this is one of the best.  It introduced a lot of new concepts and techniques in filming, and it kept with the creators tradition of recycling characters from previous series such as Hill Street Blues ""Buntz"" returning as ""Sipowicz"" in a similar but slightly different role.

Headline characters come and go with frequency (Amy Breneman) and ""Detective Kelly"" so, the viewer is never confident that any actor is ""safe.""  This allows for a bit more anxiety as situations unfold as the viewer is never confident that ""it has to turn out OK because this is a main character.""

Jimmy Smits (detective Simone) replaced ""Kelly"" and brought a new dimension to the show.  He was later recycled into I believe ""LA Law.""

It is fascinating to see such dated elements as detectives getting paged and having to find a pay phone.

The show was creative, had complex character development, pushed the envelope with censorship, and was ahead of its time in many ways.  Why not 5 stars?  Well almost nothing is perfect.  Some of the plot twists and ""coincidences"" push the ability to suspend ones reality/belief system a bit beyond the limit, but even then, they are usually pretty well done.",1406419200,,1196,4.790243902439024

1871003,5,B00008YGRR,This show is still amazing.  The depth of the characters is stunning.

1871012,5,B00008YGRR,"Actually, Jimmy Smits has star billing in the opening credits of Season 2 though Franz's Sipowitz is the more finely drawn character.
From the perspective of a 67 year old once limited by his perception of paramilitary types as bullies or jerk-offs, the excellence of this series lies in the empathy with which the characters are written and acted or do I mean the empathy I felt? Regardless, in every episode I found myself loving the characters as if they are my own brothers and sisters.

One measure of art is the effect its ability to touch and change the viewer. To my mind this series is high art because it has helped me grow beyond some of my own narrowness and hardness of heart. That's quite an accomplishment for an 20 old cops-and-robbers TV show.",1403481600,,760,4.588235294117647

John Kelly's presence was so key initially, that I feared the series would loose a lot.  Along comes Jimmy Smit's character of Bobby Simone and by the third episode, I found myself thinking ""Kelly who?""

Every episode this season shone in its own way.  ""Simone Says"" served as a great introduction for the Bobby Simone character, who soon became a fan favorite.

Key episodes from this season are:  For Whom the Skell Rolls"",which sees the final apperance of Amy Brenneman's Janic Licalsi character; Cop Suey; Simone Says; Double Abandondo; You Bet Your Life; Don We Now Our Gay Apparel; In the Butt, Bob; Vishy, Vashy Vinnie; Large Mouth Bass' Travels with Andy, and the running story line episodes featuring the George Putnam serial killer, and those featuring the Joyce Novak character, brilliantly played by future Borg Queen actress, Susanna Thompson.",1402444800,,1033,4.936416184971098

First year star David Caruso decided to chase Hollywood fame and fortune (he was to find little of either for many years) and left the show 3 episodes into the second season. In stepped Jimmy Smits and the show got better. Not so much because of Smits, who did good but not great work as a NYC detective coming in from an assignment with ""the brass"", but because Dennis Franz was allowed to grow his role as Andy Sipowicz in several directions - love life, family and the search for sobriety, all without diminishing his image as a hard boiled cop when on the job.",1394755200,,635,4.34453781512605

Or was it five? That left no alternative but to look for bootlegged sets of the entire series. They should have released the whole series on DVD.

The show retains its grittiness, its controversional subject matter, its fully developed characterizations, fabulous guest stars and dry humor.

1871290,5,B00008YGRR,"As I write this I'm about 3 episodes into Season 3. Season 2 is very, very good. The writing is getting more mature, being able to draw upon the growing depth of character that has been ever present since the first episode. Jimmy Smits is really settling into his role nicely. Denis Franz is becoming one of the most complex and deep characters ever crafted with a pen with his amazing and award worthy portrayal of Andy Sipowicz. All in all, I am hooked completely on this show and I think my TV watching is pretty much spoken for - at least for the next six months or so. I've got nearly 10 seasons with 22 episodes per season left.

I don't know why David Caruso left so abruptly, I know I can google it but never did, but I don't feel the show lost anything. Instead, I think the show got better. I always thought Caruso's style was a bit strange. I can't put my finger on it. He stood out like a sore thumb. Maybe he seemed a bit stilted, or forced. His character was a typical red-headed Irish NYC detective. All smooth and dressed up on the outside but dangerous and unpredictable at the flip of a switch. I don't think they fully exploited what I considered to be a potential deep well of complex personality that they could have with this guy. They could have, but they didn't.

All in all I am very pleased that I started watching this series. I can't wait to see what happens next.

1871305,5,B00008YGRR,"NYPD Blue is as realistic  to what it is like to be a policeman as it gets on TV. This show doesn't have the hip music playing while some runway model turned actress collects evident samples at a crime scene or performs an autopsy. It doesn't romanticize the brutality of crime it displays it and the impact it has on the lives of victims. It does inject some humor as in real life detectives need humor to assist them in getting through some days. This show is well written and extremely well acted.  Even bit parts are given to very talented actors and actresses. You will see a lot of familiar faces in some very small parts.

1871308,5,B00008YGRR,"I was living in Mississippi when the series first ran, and could not watch it then because of a boycott by the local ABC affiliate: the series was considered too obscene for the tender eyes of Mississippians. So watching it now is a reveal for me. The quick editing and use of hand held cameras (though now commonplace) really drive the show forward scene to scene, and the claustrophobia of the precinct is palpable. Now that David Caruso and his posturing have exited, the acting has settled into a realistic, comfortable groove, and the characters are thrust into believable situations that challenge the mores, not just of the day, but of today as well. I was particularly impressed by the episodes involving John, the gay temp who serves as receptionist while Donna is out finding herself. Things have changed a lot from then to now, and that is all to the good, but bravery John shows, being out in a police precinct, helps to show what was and is necessary for change to happen. And Dennis Franz just gets better playing a man who knows he has to change and has the will to struggle past his destructive impulses.",1390867200,,1120,4.633165829145729

1871514,5,B00008YGRR,Excellent police drama that stands the test of time. Dennis Franz is a treasure. The writing is first rate and much like Law & Order is a great place to catch up and coming actors before they became famous. And much like L&O was able to survive and flourish with many cast changes over the years. The one constant and the glue that kept the show going was Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz.,1376524800,,386,4.301369863013699

It doesn't hurt that Sipowitz is so unfair to the guy that we all couldn't help but like him and feel bad for him.

While not suitable for young children due to occasional nudity the complex cast of characters and their personal issues that present a cross current to the normal crime solving activities are provocative and reflect a wide range of their problems common in our society.

The likes of Steven Bochco and David Milch will never be seen again. I was glad to see the cry-baby David Caruso leave the series, because it was Dennis Franz that carried this program from its infancy to its end!

There are no words that can describe how I felt having to wait from one week to the next for the next episode! Dennis Franz was the man that MADE this show what it was and what it always will be.

This show is a tour-de-force of storytelling and acting.  The show was brilliant in weaving crime drama together with personal stories and sustaining long-arching story lines over great spans of time.  The handling of transitions as characters departed and joined the shows was, for the most part, masterful.  In the last couple of seasons, continuity was not quite as smooth as it had been in the past, but the crime stories and the personal drama remained strong.

1871923,5,B00008YGRR,"NYPD Blue had a lot of questions to answer going into the second season.  Could the show withstand the exit of David Caruso, whose star power drove Season 1's popular and critical success?  Could Dennis Franz take the lead and carry the show?  Could Jimmy Smits step in as the new partner and capture the same magic as Franz and Caruso?

The answer to all those questions turned out to be an easy yes.  Franz continued his work of making Andy Sipowicz one of the most compelling characters ever on TV.  Although Caruso did the first four episodes of the season, he gives way to Smits in the fifth show.  And as a viewer, I never looked back.

Smits made the character of Bobby Simone one that was always interesting to watch.  He exhibited so much emotion and heart as the new guy on the squad that no one could resist being pulled in by him.  His chemistry with Franz was easily on par with that of Caruso, and in some ways had more depth.  Simone allows Andy to become more and more human, giving Franz more chances to let his acting skills shine.

Season 2 also introduces one of the show's longest-running and most liked characters, Kim Delaney's Diane Russell.  Her relationship with Bobby became a huge part of the overall storyline, and her portrayal of Russell resulted in one of the best female cop roles ever done.  While the storylines week after week were plenty enough to keep viewers interested, the stellar work of the lead actors, as well as excellent supporting characters like James Martinez, Greg Medavoy, Arthur Fancy, and Donna Abondando gave the series its place in TV history.  It was a bona fide classic.

**note**  As clearly advertised, this is not a DVD set of NYPD Blue, it's an instant video set of Season 2.  Amazon's instant player is simple.  You can pause during the episodes, fast-forward or rewind in thirty-second intervals using the arrow buttons or click in the progress bar wherever you want, alternate to full screen or ""pop-out,"" placing the video in a separate window, and control the volume.  The one legitimate complaint is that it has no captions, so you're out of luck if you need those.

Despite his solid performance as Bobby Simone, it was impossible for Jimmy Smits to fill the void created by Caruso's departure.

Jimmy Smits is a wonderful actor, and equally compliments the harshness of Dennis Franz.  The storyline is excellent.  I miss seeing ""more"" of Gail O'Grady in this season, but that's okay.

Great writing in this series and particulary in this season.

Two thumbs up!!!

EDIT: What is the deal, whenever somebody mentions ""John"" the PAA, who takes the place of Mrs. Abondonza, the person asks: ""John Kelly,?"" the David Caruso character.  That guy will just not go away.  What a schlep?  Is that some type of inside joke by the writers?

How they wrote him off the show and implemented a much better fit in Jimmy Smits was brilliant as well. We find out in the season summary a little insight behind how difficult Caruso was to work with, and how badly he wanted out (a limo waiting for him at the final scene, not even sticking around to make sure it was done correctly). A producer even states that bringing in Smits was like ""opening all the windows""... And he was great as Bobby Simone. Nobody beats Franz' character as Det. Sipowicz, hence the multiple Emmy wins and nominations, but Smits' character complemented him perfectly. Just a great show, and a great season.",1145750400,5,724,4.484848484848484

What made this show really great was the way the characters were realistically portrayed. They weren't the usual squeaky clean characters we see from CSI, Bones or Crossing Jordan. In NYPD Blue we emphatize with the squad when we see the frustration in the faces and even in the gestures of the Detectives when a perp is giving them the run around or a when an incompetent squad sergeant is appointed ( Eddie Gibson )or when a fellow detective screws up a case. This was the strength of the show the ability to draw empathy from the audience. I read here Season 4 is slated for a June release.

1871974,4,B00008YGRR,"Let me preface by saying how much I loved the entire run of NYPD Blue.  Even after David Milch left and took with him the best of the show's writing, I still had a loyalty to this show unlike almost any other on television.  Season Two's beginning episodes are as good as any from the first season.  Say what you want about David Caruso, but his character was magnetic.  It's hard to believe that the guy currently chewing scenery on CSI: Miami is the same powerful, gripping actor that manned John Kelly.

Add in Dennis Franz's Sipowicz who was still at his un-PC best and you had two compelling, completely opposite leads.  With the entrance of Smits, the show lost a degree of the edge it radiated in its first season and later recovered with the casting of Rick Schroder as Danny Sorenson.  Smits is a cool customer, but his minimalist approach to dialogue is not a welcome change.  While he had his moments (I don't think anybody but Smits could have pulled off the scene with the serial killer), Smits never captivated me in the way that Caruso or even Schroeder did.

1871977,5,B00008YGRR,"I bought boxed sets one and two for my husband for Christmas last year. It had been a while since either of us had seen the early seasons of this show as they've never been repeated here in the UK since their first run.

We were quickly drawn back into the world of the New York detectives and spent a series of blissful nights enjoying revisiting all the moments we'd half forgotten. The series still holds its own against more recent examples of the genre, and certainly hasn't lost anything in the years since it was first shown. Gritty, poignant, dramatic and with charismatic characters you love and love to hate.

The special features on both sets were impressive - interesting and informative. Although I rapidly got tired of hearing them diss David Caruso, much as he seems to have deserved it with his obnoxious behaviour on set. Some of the interviews overlapped, but that seems to be common on most DVDs out there. For all that, I wasn't disappointed by the features, which is often the case, and found them well worth watching.

Enthralled with these, I blithely went online intending to order season three there and then. And to my dismay found it was nowhere to be found. Had never been released. I confess I don't understand this decision. Were it to be released tomorrow I'd snap it up.

Hopefully the rumours that it might finally be released for this Christmas will be true. It would make my gift buying for hubby so much more simple!",1124928000,8,1452,4.616279069767442
1871978,5,B00008YGRR,"Fox's is finally releasing Season 3 this month!

In my opinion, this is the best cop show out there bar none.  Yes, there are other good ones too, but NYPD Blue, started it all in the nineties with it's gritty, realistic stories, compelling characters and edgy camera work.  It's nearest rival in the nineties was ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and only ""Boomtown"" and ""The Wire"" were comparable in terms of quality over the last three or four years.  That's something!

The show actually got better after the departure of David Caruso.  Bobby Simone as played by Jimmy Smits was a much more low-key portrayal in keeping with the ensemble approach  to the show and allowed the other characters to shine as well, in contrast to Season 1.

Fox is changing the packaging slightly by putting the episodes on 4 two-sided discs rather than having 6 or 8 single sided discs.  I hope that these do not suffer the same problems as many of Universal's releases which also utilize two-sided discs.

Support this show and buy the releases so that the Fox execs continue to release all seasons until 12.  It appears that they are willing to give the box sets a second chance.  I understand that they already have Season 4 in prep but will wait to see the sales of Season 3 so all fans please note!

It should be remembered that Smits was the original choice to partner Denis Franz's character of Andy Sipowizc, but because of committments to LA Law was unable to do so, and David Caruso got the part. It works because Smits embues his character with warmth, compassion, but with an underlying strength. The episode where he is introduced is brilliant, and the on-going progression of the relationship between the two leads is never anything less than believable.

  Some reviewers express their preference for the Caruso episodes, but I have to say that for me they both work equally well. This plus the added bonus of Sipowizc's character being allowed to grow and have a personal life make series two compulsory viewing. Favourite episode? When Andy semi moves in with his new girlfriend, and she joins him in the shower, Cue one of the best lines in TV history - ""Boy, that's sure going to be clean"". Priceless!

Series three please!!!

P.S. Apparently when Caruso finished shooting his final scene he walked out the door of the precinct and hopped into a waiting cab to take him away. No re-shoot, no second take, and precious little loyalty to a show which made him a star. The words 'Prima Donna' never seemed to be more apt. Next move? Jade. Yeah right!",1122854400,7,1381,4.785714285714286
1872013,3,B00008YGRR,"The first four episodes, especially Episode 1, ""Trials and Tribulations,"" which begin to detail Caruso's exit from the series - detailed in a good documentary - are excellent. Then Jimmy Smits (""LA Law,"" ""West Wing"") enters and immediately the show begins to seem like every other cop show. Caruso brought a depth and complexity to his role that Smits cannot match - and several episodes in Season Two are just awful. Everything is telegraphed. What Caruso brought was LIFE to the show - you felt this was a real cop who had a real life and who dealt with people he worked with the way most people do - with a balance of politeness, respect, and exasperation (and sometimes anger and annoyance). Dennis Franz is always good - but his scenes with Caruso were more complex. The show was better written - tougher, sexier, riskier.  I know several folks did not like Caruso as much - and Smits is probably the more charming of the two.  But Smits is not a better actor.  And he brings the show down to a level of convention that only got worse after he left and ""Saved By the Bell"" actors seemed to take over.  If you watch the last few seasons of ""Blue,"" you see a pathetic decline of a once brilliant show.  For 26 episodes, ""NYPD Blue"" was the best cop show ever.  After David Caruso left, it became just another cop show.  The proof is in these episodes. I've actually stopped watching them mid-way because they're so predictable. UPDATE NOTE: it is interesting to me, and bewildering, that some folks do not find this review helpful.  Judge for yourself before you spend a lot of money on this DVD!  Watch the first, great season, where literally EVERY episode is top drawer drama and then compare it to some of the early episodes when Smits arrives on the scene and the great tension, complexity, and earthiness of the original series starts to go out the window. Smits IS a conventional TV actor - ""LA Law,"" ""The West Wing,"" etc. What you see is what you get: decent concentration, a little passion, and mostly lightweight conviction.  Caruso, on the other hand, as one of his co-stars, Amy Brenneman, on the first season stated,  ""was doing some of the best work on TV.""  The first four episodes of this DVD set are GREAT - and then, by Smits third or fourth episode, you feel that his character basically has no flaws, is a one-dimensional (and unbelievable) hero who seems to have no real or interesting complexities in his nature. He's annoying in that he seems to have a handle on everything - and everyone. I challenge ANYONE to refute this.  The show was a masterpiece of one, shining season and then it became ""NYPD BLUE LIGHT."" And, unfortunately, it kept getting lighter, until the final, awful seasons of disgrace. Rent this first, if you can, before you spend a lot on something that is only half as good as Season One.  Although, I will say, the first four (BEST) episodes and the documentary almost make it worth the purchase. But not quite!",1117065600,12,2958,4.577651515151516
1872014,5,B00008YGRR,"I just bought Season 1 and 2 on DVD last week! I watched both of them and am wanting more... Where's Season 3, 4, 5...??? Does anyone know if they are planning on releasing the next seasons? I agree with the other post, the show is ending in 2 days. It would be a fitting and ideal time to release the next season. The execs really could have marketed it and advertised it on the final show's commercials.

But, anyways, these two DVD sets (1 & 2) are worth buying!",1109462400,10,465,4.166666666666667

1872016,5,B00008YGRR,"Okay, I just binged on the entire NYPD Blue Season 2 collection, all I can say that Season 2 was one great season! NYPD blue returns with a bang, this time with the addition of detective Bobby Simone a hard hitting Puerto-Rican French detective with a nose for crime. While Simone lacks some of Kelly's straight-laced manner, he's also slightly more accessible. (Kelley was a bit too rigid, imho). Lipowicz is of course excellent... Although I COULD do without the numerous scenes of him using the john, and half-naked. Sorry, he's a great actor but seeing Lipowicz's tush does nothing for me. Also I do think the female detectives didn't have half as much personality or screen time. (If I see another alcoholism subplot I will scream)!

This is a great series, sure to delight fans of police drama. But...Just once, I'd like to see the cops outfoxed by a criminal. Watching NYPD Blue, you'd think all the detectives were Mensa candidates and we all know that just aint so!",1097020800,7,974,4.729411764705882
1872017,5,B00008YGRR,"Season two is just as good as season. I never watched the show and realize now what I have been missing. Several powerful episodes. Sipowitz is a great charecter and Simone comes out strong. I was worried when Kelly keft the show, but Simone is a better, more well rounded charecter.",1095206400,8,283,4.568627450980392
1872018,5,B00008YGRR,"I found this on ""tvshowsondvd.com"", dated 7/01/2004:

 They often say, ""No news is good news,"" but that's not the case when it comes to DVDs. If a studio has been releasing a show on DVD and then you don't hear anything about a subsequent season, the assumption is that the sets were selling poorly and no further sets are planned. When Fox removed the January 13th listing for season 3 from their consumer site, things were looking grim for the series. We all assumed the worst: that Season 3 wouldn't be released.

 Earlier today we got some good news from Fox; they plan on releasing the set, they're just looking for a good time to do so. With the TV-on-DVD schedule becoming crowded, Fox wants to find a release date where the title will get good exposure and sell enough copies so they can continue releasing the series. We don't know when that'll be, but we wanted to bring NYPD Blue fans some good news, since our previous news was rather depressing.",1091836800,31,958,4.5523255813953485
1872019,5,B00008YGRR,It seems Fox are heading the words of all those fans out there desperate for season 3 and have said they are planning to release season 3 but as yet have no confirmed release date.

7987928,5,B00008YGRR,"If it can be said that NYPD Blue Season 1 helped changed the tone and format of TV police procedural dramas forever, with its gritty realism, use of hand-held cameras, outstanding acting and writing, and multi-episode story arcs, then it must also be said that NYPD Blues second season further refined and amplified the genre.

NYPD Blue Season 2 got off to a rip-roaring start with satisfactory resolutions of several story arcs left over at the end of Season 1. Two actors  David Caruso (who plays Detective John Kelly) and Amy Brenneman (who plays Officer Janice Licalsi) departed the show early in the season, and the resolution of their joint story arc is both realistic and tragic. NYPD Blues second season introduces Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits), a detective that transfers to the 15th Squad and immediately becomes Detective Andy Sipowiczs new partner. There are budding romances between Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence), and between Detective Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) and Administrative Assistant Donna Abandando (Gail OGrady.) Newly minted Detective James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) settles in to the 15th Squad and quickly proves his ability. But the central theme of the show is the myriad of tough, difficult cases that the detectives of then 15th Squad tackle and attempt to solve every week.

Theres not much I can add to the litany of praise that the first two seasons of this show has received through the years. Every episode features a superbly written story thats taut, tense, grittily realistic, and acted to perfection by every cast member.

This 6-DVD set is technically excellent, with top-notch video and audio quality. Episodes are shown in their original 4:3 aspect ratio. Video is clean, crisp, sharp, and imbued with vivid natural colors. Audio is in the original 2-channel stereo format thats also clean and bright.

NYPD Blue is the very first TV series I ever bought on DVD.  Since then, Ive watched it many times and have always derived tremendous entertainment from it.  Highly recommended.",1517788800,,2058,5.125373134328358

Sent 30 years in the Justice System and most of the pathos came when the offenders displayed their entitled disregard for other people's rights, we did our jobs and weren't constantly screwing each other. The Victims were the people we found trying to cope in the wake of the wreckage of some criminal violation. You have to suffer through every social slight cliche to the offender. According to the writers most offenders are beaten into submission...so sad and not true. The Police are just better than that.
