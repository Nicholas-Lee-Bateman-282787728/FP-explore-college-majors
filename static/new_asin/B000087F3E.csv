1827867,5,B000087F3E,"""Secret Agent X-9"" is the title of two Universal serials, the first from 1937, and this one from 1945 in 13 chapters, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins.

Late in 1942, Japanese researchers discover by accident that a failed experimental explosive known as ""722,"" developed by American scientist Dr. Albert Raymond (Mauritz Hugo) works as an aviation fuel when mixed with distilled water.  But they don't have the formula, and had only the one sample, brought to Japan by Dr. Hakahima (Benson Fong) who had worked with Raymond.  Attempting to recover Hakahima's notes, their American hireling is followed by Phil Corrigan (Lloyd Bridges), Secret Agent X-9, leading to Shadow Island, the only neutral zone in the Far East.  The island is run by casino owner Lucky Kamber (Cy Kendall), who provides the warring factions with protection, for a price.  But Nabura (Victoria Horne) reminds Kamber that his island remains neutral only while it serves the interests of Japan.

The Japanese need to find another way to get the ""722"" formula, and their plans move slowly enough to allow the remaining chapters to be concerned mostly with intrigue and elaborate death traps suitable for cliffhangers.  If the plot has a credibility gap or two, Lloyd Bridges is fine as the title character, ably assisted by Keye Luke as Chinese agent Ah Fong.  Jan Wiley has an active role as Lynn Moore, appearing to work for Nabura as ""Miss Australia"" in broadcasts of Japanese propaganda, but these contain coded messages for Australian Intelligence.  Victoria Horne as Nabura might not look especially Japanese, but she's no worse than what was usually done at the time.  Her main underlings are Bach and Takahari (George Lynn and Clarence Lung) while Kamber has his casino monitored by Marker and Solo (Jack Overman and Samuel S. Hinds).  There's the Dupray hotel, run by Papa Pierre and ""Mama Pierre"" Dupray (Ferdinand Munier and Ann Codee), who just might be agents of some kind, and a German ship, the ""Lorelei"" commanded by Kapitan Grut (Arno Frey), used as headquarters for Nabura and her allies.  A number of familiar faces show up in small roles, including Edmund Cobb, John Merton, George Chesebro, Stanley Price, I. Stanford Jolley, Gene Roth and George Eldredge.  Typical of Universal's serials there is quite a bit of dialogue, much of it rehashing the plot, but the anti-Japanese rhetoric is toned down considerably from what it had been in earlier serials.  There are only a couple recycled cliffhangers, the stock footage is mostly well-integrated and the uncredited musical score does a good job of supporting the action.

VCI's edition, # 8344 is on two DVD's.  The print used for the transfer is excellent, little visible grain with good gray scale and quite sharp.  Even the small MPPDA certificate numbers can be read, except in Chapter Eight, and all seem to be correct.  The sound is good, free of noise and low in distortion, if a little lacking in high frequency content.  ""Extras"" include a commentary track by Max Allan Collins that can be selected to play during the first two chapters, and while it makes no direct reference to what is on-screen, gives good background information, helping to explain the differences in the title character between the two serials based on the ""X-9"" comic strip.  Collins also does a 15-minute ""telephone interview"" with Beau Bridges, present on both discs, as are a ""Photo Gallery"" with 18 pictures, mostly lobby cards; ""Previews of VCI Cliffhangers"" with trailers for ""Winners of the West,"" ""The Master Key"" and ""Mysterious Mr. M.""  There are also ""Biographies / Filmographies"" of Lloyd Bridges, Keye Luke, Jan Wiley and Victoria Horne, plus directors Lewis D. Collins and Ray Taylor.

As usual with serials, a day or so between chapters helps, especially with all the dialogue recounting what happened in the earlier installments.  Both of the ""X-9"" serials are good, though different in style.  This second one benefits from good acting and the care taken with the production, which help overcome a few absurdities in the plot.  VCI's transfer is splendid, and the special features add to its value.",1362960000,,4150,5.005822416302766

1827869,4,B000087F3E,"The other reviews are pretty exhaustive and informative... please read them, those folks put a lot of effort into typing them in for us.  As for mine you can read the rest or not... just read the title, it is all you really need to know.

The 1937 version is really, really bad, too bad even for me and I LOVE old bad serials.  This version, with Lloyd Bridges (who later starred in Sea Hunt) is actually good, with special effects consistent with this era and a pretty good story with a few lame bits to pad out the serial for a few more weeks worth of episodes.  I recommend this version highly, kind of like a really bad, and cheesy Casablanca without the acting, and drama. Great stuff!",1215216000,2,690,4.325581395348837
1827870,5,B000087F3E,"There's not much connection between the two versions of ""Secret Agent X-9"" except that they both were inspired by the same comic strip, which actually wasn't very popular.  The DVD release by VMI has a commentary which tells you far more about that comic strip than you care to know.  It also has an interesting interview with Beau Bridges about the lead, his father Lloyd Bridges (1913-1998).

This was only Bridges' second leading role, the first being the previous year in an unimportant movie, but he had had minor, mostly uncredited roles in at least 52 movies when he starred in this one, so he appears experienced and confident in his role.  He also had the advantage of having won a fat baby contest in 1914 in which the judge, former president William Howard Taft, pronounced little Lloyd as fat as HE was!  As a Columbia contract player Bridges appeared in B-Westerns and Three Stooges comedies.  He is just about perfect here as Secret Agent X-9, probably the best performance I have ever seen in a serial.

But this group is almost an ensemble cast, as the supporting roles are quite important and extremely well done.  Mr. Solo, who sits at the end of the bar playing tiddly winks through all 13 chapters, is one of the most memorable serial charcters ever.  His appearance in the penultimate shot of the final chapter is an absolute gem!  He's played by Samuel S. Hinds, who was Jimmy Stewart's dad in ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and the corrupt mayor in ""Destry Rides Again.""

Jan Wiley (""Dick Tracy vs. Crime, Inc.""), as a non-accented Australian ostensibly working for the Japanese but actually sending secret messages to the Allies, is also extremely impressive.  Two Asian actors each of whom played a son of Charlie Chan are also present, Keye Luke (""Smilin' Jack"") as Chinese agent Ah Fong, and Benson Fong as a Japanese scientist.  A non-Asian, Victoria Horne, plays the sinister Nabura, and walks around saying ""Ah, so"" with her eyes closed.  Cy Kendall plays bar-owner Lucky Kamber with verve.

This is probably tied with ""Smiln' Jack"" as Universal's best serials.  It has great 1940's atmosphere and more action than is typical of Universal serials.  Unfortunately the cliffhangers ARE typical of Universal serials, but the ending of Chapter One is pretty clever with X-9 tricking a Japanese submarine into sinking a German ship.  Typically, however, a hail of gunfire simply misses the good guys.  The opening title sequence in each chapter is really classy, and the music sets the scene even to the blast from a boat's gun in the background fitting in beautifully with the music.  Many of the scenes, especially in Kamber's bar, are redolent of the atmosphere of ""Casablanca.""

The acting is excellent from all concerned, making this a top-notch serial.",1136764800,27,2776,4.8763326226012795

1827872,4,B000087F3E,"This is the second version of Secret Agent X-9, released by Universal in 1945 and not directly connected to the same serial from 1937. Max Allan Collins gives an informed, interest-holding commentary that can be played along with the first chapter and parts of the second. Among the details he gives is how King Features developed this strip to compete with Chicago Tribune's Dick Tracy, which he himself ended up writing at one point.

As the serial progresses thru its 13 chapters, we know from the beginning who the primary bad guys are. But among the other characters, we gradually learn who is on whose side. It takes place on Shadow Island off the coast of China. The island is designated neutral territory during WWII. It's pretty big on the map they show: probably about the size of China's Hainan Island although not the same shape.

Ethnic casting is a little off. Keye Luke does play a Chinese good guy, but there are other Chinese actors playing Japanese, and the facial features don't match. And the nefarious Dragon-Lady type arch villain is called Nabura: supposedly Japanese but wearing Chinese garb and apparently of southern European extraction (Victoria Horne). But we can suspend this disbelief.

And here is a chance to see a young Lloyd Bridges and later to hear Collins interview Beau, one of his equally famous sons.

The quality of the print is usually good. Some of the night scenes are hard to make out, and I don't know if that depends on my monitor. Most chapters are about 20 minutes long. But one detail makes me uneasy: Chapter 9 runs under 16 minutes. Are there four missing minutes that they were unable to find and restore?

Serial lovers: Be sure to include this and its 1937 counterpart in your collection.",1092355200,24,1743,4.758278145695364

A young Lloyd Bridges stars and Keye Luke steals the show great chemistry between the two. This spy thriller moves along at a fast clip for serial with out gadgets robots or special weapons. This is a classic serial with heroes taking on villains in a fight to the finish in WWII. Samule Hinds is in it and you will get a hoot out of character he plays. Great fun from a solid character actor. You can not go wrong if you are into serials like I am. I had heard of but never seen the serial.

7979356,4,B000087F3E,"I'm not a fanatic or anything, but have a real fondness for some of these old serials. Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers top the list, of course,. but this adds a different kind of feel the to genre.

Setting: WWII, the last war that most Americans could feel good about (and lord knows we've had a few since then). There are the conspicuous bad guys, the Japanese (this lay in the shadow of Pearl Harbor, remember), seeking the secret avgas formula. It might sound pedestrian, but things like jet fuel, rubber for tires, and other homely materials really did (and do) win wars. Then, since this is based on a comic, base it on one of the best comic artists ever - Alex Raymond - and scripter to match - Dashiell Hammett, of noir novel fame.

I like this one, really, but find that it works best as a radio play. Hammett's scripting is tight and exciting, but the occasional glance up when I'm doing something else seems to keep me up to date with the visuals. Nicely done for a low budget, I'll come back to this one again - but I can't say it's a must-have for any collection.

Unfortunately, he had brought only one sample back from the United States; doesn't remember the formula;  and left his notes back in America.  Perhaps someone could retrieve them . . . .

In a gambling joint on Shadow Island, an American of doubtful loyalty, is coerced by a Japanese agent to contact a friend in America, who might be tricked into getting the chemist's notes and delivering them to Shadow Island . . . .

Washington catches wind that something is afoot.  Agent X-9 is on the job trailing a man couriering a package to Shadow Island, confronts him, convinces him the ship he is on is actually run by the NAZI's, who plan on transferring him to a Japanese sub.  Unfortunately, before they can escape, the ship is sunk along with the package;  only X-9 survives . . . .

With the help of the Australians, X-9 gets to the island, joins with a Chinese agent and an Australian agent to discover what the Japanese are up to and to disrupt their plans.  Meanwhile, the Japanese have a new plan . . . .

Cliffhanger setups & escapes: mundane.  Exception: the mechanism to drop X-9 into a room of spikes is imaginative.
