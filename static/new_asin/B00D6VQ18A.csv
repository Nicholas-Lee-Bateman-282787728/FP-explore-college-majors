8590134,3,B00D6VQ18A,"The plot in this 1952 film and even its two subplots have been done many times before, but Glenn Ford is fun to watch. Someone for some reason has placed a huge amount of explosives on a train in England designed to detonate when the train reaches a certain city. The train is diverted to an area where if the bombs explode there will be fewer casualties. The Glenn Ford character is having problems with his wife who is bored, nothing exciting happens in their life anymore. When she leaves their house with a suitcase, Ford is called upon by the government to try to disassemble the bomb.  A second subplot is a somewhat senile man who loves trains who does not leave when the other city inhabitants are removed from the city and gets in the way.",1503446400,2,748,4.420289855072464
8590135,5,B00D6VQ18A,"It is a old movie. hard to find, Glenn Ford at his best!  The price was good. It arrived in excellent condition.",1494374400,,112,4.090909090909091
8590136,4,B00D6VQ18A,"Police procedural involving the railroad police tracking a saboteur while they divert the shipment of sea mines to a less used siding for disarming.

Only odd thing is that Ford's character is a Canadian born in Quebec province, but he says he doesn't understand his WW2 wife speaking in French?  I know there is a dialect difference, but he should have heard some of the language growing up!

Most of the action takes place at night with the finale in early morning.  We see the freight train hauling away at night, then dayside shots of the cars on the siding.  At another station the police await as two trains come in to unload passengers, hoping to catch their man traveling to see his dirty work come to fruition.

Although it is implied that this is Communist sabotage, this wouldn't likely be how a spy cell would operate, as someone else would watch for the results.  An apologist might say the man was working for money and enjoyed blowing things up.",1444348800,,960,4.6117647058823525

8590138,5,B00D6VQ18A,"American in England.

If you like Trains then you should like this one.

It seems that everyone would be a little retarded if they lived near abandoned train tracks.",1394323200,,165,4.655172413793103
8590139,3,B00D6VQ18A,"While the beginning of the film's story offered many possibilities for suspense with complications to the plot, the outcome left you flat. The cover indicates the woman on the left is running from danger as it appears she is being chased on the tracks by Glenn Ford's character, that scene never occurs. The terror is not translated very well to the viewer.
The original Narrow Margin, or The Lady Vanishes are much better films from roughly the same era. Runaway Train or Source Code are current movies with a similar theme that hold your attention and are much more suspenseful throughout than this film. Terror on a Train had potential that it did not fully realize.",1389052800,3,669,4.775862068965517
8590140,4,B00D6VQ18A,"The ending is quite predictable, but despite of this (largely due to Glenn Ford's acting) the film creates real suspense.",1384732800,3,121,5.1
8590141,3,B00D6VQ18A,"I purchased this picture because I was lead to believe by the cover and description and title that it would take place aboard a train. It doesn't. In fact, it doesn't concern passenger trains at all.

 As far as suspense or ""terror"" goes, it is absent as well! I found it very plodding, predictable and not at all suspenseful. It would have been much better had it concerned threatened passengers aboard a train with time running out.  Time was an element here, but by itself, it isn't enough.

I wouldn't call it a ""noir"" either. That term is so often used to describe pictures that are merely crime dramas or mysteries.

So, overall, I didn't find it very well-written or very interesting.
By the way, if you are looking for good train pictures, try ""Narrow Margin"" from the '50s, ""The Lady Vanishes"" from the '30s,  ""Brief Encounter"", ""Berlin Express"" and 'Murder is my Beat"".",1377129600,8,879,4.675324675324675
