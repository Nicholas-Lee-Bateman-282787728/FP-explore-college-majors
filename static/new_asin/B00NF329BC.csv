8677653,5,B00NF329BC,This film looked very good on blu-ray. Bill Bixby was very good as the lead character and the cast of supporting actors were wonderful as well. Bill Bixby finds himself stuck with three  orphaned children and finds it difficult to adjust. It is a good family film.,1456012800,3,264,4.617021276595745

8677655,5,B00NF329BC,"Pretty good transfer to Blu-Ray. It does still have some grain in the picture, but all in all, it never looked better. Big improvement over the DVD version. I just wish it included some special features, but it does not. This is a funny, clean, family movie that holds the test of time.",1423267200,7,286,4.415094339622642
