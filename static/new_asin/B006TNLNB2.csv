5016377,3,B006TNLNB2,"Takes place in Ireland, but without much of an Irish Accent, or shots of their gorgeous country.

Decent acting, a little sex for those that like it in a movie, and an interesting conclusion. The title of the movie is a bit of a misnomer, in that there are no scenes which would even suggest the titles name, unless the producer is looking at a mental shackling as the premise for it.",1394755200,3,384,4.333333333333333
5016378,2,B006TNLNB2,"Where does Amazon find these crappy movies?  I couldn't begin to try to explain what this movie was about.  I don't think the actors, director, or writer could tell you either as it seems they couldn't figure out what they were trying to do.  Somebody dies.  There is a funeral with sinister characters lurking at the funeral.  The sister of the murdered man is being stalked by these characters for a reason that is never really disclosed.  She has dreams of a house and men in masks.  She and her boyfriend visit her grandmother in a mental facility because she knows what's going on.  I only wish she had shared it before getting murdered.  They see her dead body in the bed.  Do you think they tried to call a nurse or doctor or police like normal people?  No. They run.  And run into the sinister people and a chase ensues.  From this point on, nothing makes any sense.  People die.  She is kidnapped by someone in the house and some satanic ceremony begins. It appears that the old man wants her soul to continue his life. The old man conducting the ceremony is killed.  Or is he?  What happens to the girl?  We don't know because... Well, you can watch this dreck if you want, but I'd suggest wasting your time on something better like counting the grains of sand on a beach.",1394150400,10,1282,4.405982905982906
5016379,2,B006TNLNB2,"The story is not that good, neither is the acting. I kept watching because I was trying to decide if the movie's bleached colors worked or not. I appreciated that some thought had gone into all those white/dull yellow/brown settings only relieved by bits of dull blue. But it made my eyes tired, all those same colors. Nevertheless, for anyone who enjoys horror movies  primarily for the visuals and the atmosphere, this is OK.",1383436800,,427,4.77027027027027
5016380,4,B006TNLNB2,"This was a real treat after some of the doozies I have watched at no cost via Amazon Prime. It is the first one that I felt was worthy of any actual review/praise. The acting was good; characters developed and believable; script well written; music appropriate and scenery beautiful. I think that it is worth watching. Is it likely to ever win an Oscar... nope, but so what! Its a good way to pass about an hour and a half. It grabs attention and holds it -start to finish.",1381363200,4,473,4.325842696629214
5016381,2,B006TNLNB2,"Quite simply a bad movie and not even worth the rental. Should have gone directly to Amazon Prime for free viewership for those members and even then I doubt if most viewers would have watched the entire affair.
I watched every second because I screwed up and spent money for the ""honor"" of watching the movie. Thank goodness it wasn't very much money but a nickle is too much for garbage like this.",1340668800,6,399,4.47945205479452
5016382,3,B006TNLNB2,"Convoluted shenanigans about a man killed for all the wrong reasons.

The IRISH surroundings are a nice diversion from a plot that has masked cultists,ghosts,treachery dealing with mothering children with a dark secret.

The gunplay was very well done and felt like real jeopardy was about to befall the innocent.",1328659200,5,313,5.24
8504061,3,B006TNLNB2,"Shackled begins showing a man sneaking upstairs and shooting someone in a mansion while others begin a ritual.  The story quickly switches to the present as we see two police officers photographing a dead man named Brian lying on the bottom of a cliff beside a beach.  We see the funeral and the introduction of Brian's sister Sarah.  Two suspicious men in a car mention Sarah and how she was once pregnant unless they were twins.  Another two men (one of which is Sarah's boyfriend) mention how Brian went to Wales after someone named Margaret died and they thought he was going on the right track.

After Sarah's boyfriend leaves Sarah takes a nap.  When she hears something suddenly a man who was hiding upstairs close to Sarah's room attacks her along with someone else in the house before he runs away.  Sarah and her boyfriend think it's a burglar connected to the shady people Brian was hanging around with.  They think the burglar was there for a reason, so they check Brian's bedroom for anything out of place.  Sarah and her dad have a discussion to figure out who wanted to kill Brian.  Sarah has a dream she's running towards a castle and sees her brother up ahead.  He turns around and screams at her.

A detective from the victim's support unit named Fiona shows up to ask Sarah questions about her brother.  She mentions the break in and burglar.  She wants to know about Sarah's dreams and recommends medication to help Sarah sleep better.  Sarah has another nightmare she's in the woods and strange people begin to appear and walk around her.  Sarah and a female friend have coffee as Sarah reminisces about Brian.  Sarah reads into Brian's journal that he had a dream he was at a mansion.  He was at the place their mother lived before she went to the asylum.  Brian mentions that his dreams about their mother didn't feel like dreams and he wasn't in control.  ""He is"" implying another man is controlling Brian.

Sarah reads into Brian's journal with her boyfriend.  Sarah falls asleep and dreams she's entering that mansion after these mysterious people enter.  They recite something and Sarah looks at everyone in the room with concern.  She walks upstairs and sees these mysterious cult-like people drag someone away.  She then falls to the beach where Brian was killed.  He comes alive and looks at her.  Sarah wakes up, walks into her boyfriend's bedroom and tries strangling him.  Sarah mentions the journal and the dreams with the same control issues.  Sarah recommends her boyfriend see someone who was having the same dreams named Margaret.  Sarah thinks this girl might have some answers.

The detective lady Fiona drops by and asks Sarah more questions about her sleeping issues and wonders how the medication is holding up.  She strongly suggests Sarah uses the medication.  When Fiona mentions the mansion Sarah gets defensive.  ""I never mentioned any mansion!""  Fiona speaks to someone on the phone about Sarah seeking Margaret and the mansion.  Sarah tells her boyfriend it's odd the detective knows about the mansion while they visit the hospital to see Margaret.

They find out Margaret is dead when they visit her room.  Suddenly Sarah remembers something about the funeral.  As Sarah and her boyfriend head outside Fiona and another man run after them.  They run around inside the hospital looking for a way out.  They manage to escape and drive away.  Fiona calls in a homicide.  Sarah and her boyfriend determine they have to tell the police and show them Brian's journal.  Sarah's dad calls her and says since Margaret's dead, Fiona thinks Sarah killed Margaret on purpose to inherit her money.  Sarah's shocked.

Sarah's boyfriend calls a woman and asks her to pull files on Margaret.  She finds that Margaret was brought into the hospital in 1983.  She was crazy.  She had visions and was taken from her family.  Sarah has a dream she's walking upstairs and sees a dark man at the end of the hallway softly calling her name.  Sarah's boyfriend finds research on a cop named Larry on his laptop.  He also finds pictures of the mansion from Sarah's dream.  It burned down.  This cop brought down a cult taking place there.  Sarah thinks the people from her dreams are members of this cult.  She wonders if Larry killed Brian.  Sarah's boyfriend thinks that's possible, but Fiona could be the killer as well.

Sarah and her boyfriend mention Margaret's case to some guy, and he remember how weird the whole thing was.  He mentions getting into drugs during this hazy time.  Larry had a sister who joined a new religious cult and died a short time later during a suicide ritual pact.  All the cult members died.  No trace of their leader.  Larry became obsessed with justice and became a cop.  He stuck with this case for years but never came up with anything.  He was convinced the cult members were draining souls from his victims to extend their own lives.

In the 80's Larry became a detective and thinks he finally found the cult leader.  Margaret got involved in her own cult.  Larry wanted the police to help get Margaret out but they wouldn't do it.  Larry approaches Margaret's parents and they agree to hire him to get their daughter back.  Larry storms somebody's house and sees lots of dead bodies.  The place burns down after Larry rescues Margaret, but she spends the rest of her life in the asylum.  Larry retires from the police force and concludes the case was a cover up but spends his life convinced Margaret's still in the house.

The man warns Sarah and her boyfriend that evil is connected to this case.  When the man walks into his living room he sees Sarah and her boyfriend on the news since they're fugitives.  When he's about to call the cops the boyfriend yanks the phone away from him and punches him out.  They quickly leave the house and drive away.  Sarah and her friend from the coffee shop discuss what to do.  Sarah tells her she's going to find an address that proves she and her boyfriend are innocent.  Sarah makes out with her boyfriend.  When she falls asleep she dreams she's holding the side of the walls scared as cult members in the dark room behind Sarah stare at her.  Margaret is about to drink blood from the ritual cup but spits it out.

Sarah smacks her boyfriend while he's asleep across the eye.  She then disappears as the boyfriend sneaks around Fiona's property breaking into the house.  He overhears Fiona talking to her friends and dad.  Fiona's one male friend says he can't let Sarah reach that mansion and if her friend gets in the way (the boyfriend)...  yup, the boyfriend will get it too.  The boyfriend sneaks out the back window and drives away.  Fiona's dad insists on going to the mansion while Fiona stays behind.  Fiona goes after him.

Fiona's dad visits Margaret at the hospital.  She's awake now.  He apologizes for everything.  She says ""You're here to take me to him"" but Fiona's dad says he can't.  He says if he had known Margaret was pregnant all those years ago things would've been very different.  He then shoves a pillow over her face as she screams.  This moment is really sad!  At least Fiona's dad does the nice thing and places the pillow back behind Margaret's head after he's done suffocating her.

Sarah visits the mansion alone.  She's apprehensive to open the front door.  She walks around the back yard.  A caretaker named Frank asks if she wants to come in and have some tea.  She tells him she's here to have a look.  Sarah asks Frank if he sees anyone out here but he says other than his sister who sometimes visits, no. She begins to feel dizzy so Frank asks if she'd like to rest.  While taking Sarah upstairs she turns around and sees figures in the darkness of the back hallway.  Frank says ever since Sarah's mother has been taken he needs someone in the same bloodline to finish the ritual.  Sarah will help set him free.

Sarah soon wakes up feeling ritualistic!  Okay bad joke, sorry.  The boyfriend arrives and grabs a shotgun inside Frank's kitchen.  Outside he tells Fiona and her father to drop their weapons.  The man hanging around Fiona is shot during the conflict.  Fiona's father says to her ""I told you not to come here"".  The cult members walk in and surround Sarah's bed upstairs.  Inside Fiona shoots at Sarah's boyfriend but he's able to tuck inside a room.  Fiona's dad punches him senseless when he breaks in a moment later, but the boyfriend's able to retaliate by kicking him in the face then pushing his shotgun across his throat, suffocating him.

The boyfriend walks into the bedroom where Sarah is.  He shoots Frank in the back but it doesn't phase him.  Frank strangles the boyfriend by the throat and lifts him in the air against a wall before Sarah smacks him with the ritual cup.  She then passes out.  The boyfriend lifts her up and carries her outside, but not before setting the bedroom on fire.  When outside watching the mansion burn, the boyfriend dies.  Not sure why. It wasn't smoke inhalation and he wasn't attacked by any guns or knives that I know of.  Maybe he was shot earlier while fending off Fiona and her father outside.  After this, later on, we see a man and his young daughter enter the mansion where Frank's waiting.  ""Ah, this must be Michelle!""

This movie's okay but there isn't much of a story to be honest.  The pace is really slow and more of a mystery than thriller.  The movie feels like it wants to add some cheesy action moments too based on the soundtrack.  The acting's decent though.  The horror mostly comes from the scary dreams Sarah has, which are pretty scary granted but the story itself is tame in comparison.  I don't know if I'd recommend this movie or not.  I'll have to think about it.",1501718400,,9697,4.640330188679245

8504065,3,B006TNLNB2,"I thought Shackled was well done for what it was. Obviously an indy on a budget, the acting was above par for this sort of thing. The script also kept me interested although it got a little confusing at the end. It was well-directed and I was not even bothered by the CGI fire.
