1785541,5,B00006LPDR,"This marvelous movie is director Vittorio De Sica's realistic fairy tale about the poor in post-WW II Italy - and it's a magical movie indeed. A young man named Toto (played by Francesco Golisano), found in a cabbage patch as a baby by a kindly old woman (Emma Gramatica), and raised in an orphange after she dies, wants nothing more than to make others happy. He goes to a shantytown and spreads joy all around, but when oil is accidentally discovered on the property, the owners try to force the squatters out.

Then the fairy tale element kicks in: Gramatica reappears and gives Golisano a magic dove which will grant every wish. But after granting all the wishes he can, the dove is stolen back by the angels. The shantytown people are arrested, but with one last miracle allowed, they all escape and fly away on brooms!

The juxtaposition of the very real shantytown (you can still view the ruins of Milan from the war) against the fairy tale elements of goodness and magic works wonderfully. De Sica's satire is not all one sided, either: the landowners are obviously depicted as avaricious and heartless, but greedy too are the shantytown residents in their wishes of the magical dove. After making THE BICYCLE THIEF it's no surprise how well De Sica handles the realistic segments of the movie; it's the magical elements that he deals with so subtly that amazes most. It's a superb movie, definitely worth a watch.",1144972800,5,1422,4.729838709677419
1785558,5,B00006LPDR,"I bought this dvd to complete my collection of 3 De Sica's great classics. ""The Bicycle Thief"" and "" Humberto D"". Great Italian director. Excellent movies that depict the drama of man's inability to communicate, neo realism, post war environment, corruption, friendship and mostly important;  played by non-actors.
If you really want to get away from mediocre commercial movies try Vittorio De Sica's movies. And do not be surprise if tears start flowing.",1456876800,,455,5.232876712328767
1785559,5,B00006LPDR,"Shoeshine is one of the primary post-war Italian neo-realist films by Vittorio de Sica. The story of the two shoeshine boys, Giusseppe(Smordoni) and Pascale(Interlenghi) , who earn a bare living through being shoeshine boys to American troops stationed in Italy. What they earn they spend on riding a horse, which they hope to buy one day. Filmed in location in post-war Rome using non-professional actors. Inspired by the real stories of those struggling to overcome the oppressive forces of a corrupt and ineffective political system, it was based on two boys who worked to go horse-riding.

Post-war Italy is troubled and depressed, plagued by poverty and unemployment. Giusseppes and Pascales dream is to escape harsh reality through riding a horse. They are in the process of saving enough money to buy the horse. There are scenes of pure joy as the boys both ride the horse together in town or countryside, with music accompanying these emotions. Giusseppe is friends with a little girl. The boys become involved in petty crime through Giusseppes older brother. They get caught by the police, questioned and sentenced to juvenile prison. They become split up by society, placed in separate cells. One betrays the other through trying to protect him.

The scenes filmed in prison are especially good, with crowds of prisoners. There are scenes where the juveniles are shown a film, and another where they are shown having mass showers. The cell scenes show the prisoners as they distribute the food in their parcels. The system corrupts their youthful innocence and their love for each other is destroyed. The food is awful and the sickly soon die. The corrective state has brutalised the love and trust at the heart of humanity. As in King Lear there is no happy ending, pathos turns to tragedy. A poignant scene is as the boys are taken away in a prison van and Giusseppes girlfriend is left standing, watching, through the bars.

This raw emotional black and white film takes a back to basics approach to both society and film-making, erasing the polish, the studied scripts, the production design and the over-elaborate acting styles of the past, leaving a stone of reconstruction. De Sica was a master mason of the recovery of dignity, vitality overcoming adversity. Rough around the edges, but instinctive with life and truth. Brilliant performances from the two young actors.",1446508800,,2387,5.037974683544304

1785561,4,B00006LPDR,"I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. Shoeshine is considered to be a masterpiece by some critics, and although its very good and definitely worth watching, I wouldn't go that far. I would say its a classic Italian film from the 1940s, not a masterpiece. I enjoyed the movie, and it had my attention from beginning to end. The circumstances in which the kids find themselves in are depressing, but the direction, the story, the acting are all very well done.",1438300800,,454,4.481927710843373

1785565,3,B00006LPDR,"Director Vittorio De Sica could produce either comedy or poignant drama equally well.  Shoeshine is a poignant example of the heavy drama which De Sica could turn-out, and may not be for everyone.  What has come down to us, in Shoeshine, is a stunning example of the Italian Neo Realist School of filmmaking.  Shoeshine is a prison picture, essentially, portraying the entrapped situation of abandoned children trying, as best they could, to hustle a living and survive on the streets of what is probably Naples.  De Sica, himself, came from a similar environment and is able to easily empathize with the boys portrayed in the harsh life scorching adventures they share. They seek some escape from their depressing, incarcerated, struggle to survive the world of disenfranchised inmates in a tough ""correctional institution"". But when fortuitous chance affords an accidental opportunity to escape their hopeless world of incarceration, the boys ultimately learn that you can't go home again.  While one of Vittorio De Sica's earliest masterworks validates his position of one of the greatest of Italy's directors, the story spun in Shoeshine is not a cheerful one, and the viewer should not expect light entertainment.",1398038400,,1218,5.257731958762887

1785567,5,B00006LPDR,"There are several World War II - and post World War II movies.  In this DVD, the film by Vittorio De Sica, portrays the tragedy of Post - World War II Italy.  Casualties are not found just on the Battlefield, but also among the civilian populations, but also the orphans.  De Sica possessed masterful genius in revealing not only the plight of two boys locked into poverty and violence, but also, the genuine efforts  of Italian authorities who were overwhelmed by the countless demands to relieve the young from the harsh realities of the streets. American troops have the street waifs shine their shoes with generous tips, food and items.  Even the Italian Authorities can not avoid the incidents regarding miscarriages of justice when the innocent end up in a brutal state juvenile detention center.  There is no awareness that rationing of food and other items did not end for years - even decades - after World War II in some European nations.  The consequences on the civilian populations were tragic even with the benefit of the Marshall Plan.  ""Shoeshine"" is a masterpiece revealing such a state of affairs.  De Sica's production is a sobering profile of that history.",1390867200,,1176,4.869346733668341
1785587,5,B00006LPDR,"The film is dated but only when it comes to the production values.  The rest of the piece is just as timely today as it was when Vittorio de Sica made this film.  This probably one of the best examples of neo realism in Italian Cinema.  The bond between the two boys is exceptional and then tested beyond what either of them expects.  What's interesting is that de Sica never plays with this he peels the layers back and lets them resonate through the film.  This is probably the best definition of ""for every action there is a reaction"".  The performances from non professionals are short of amazing.  Sometimes they seem a little over the top but in actuality when one is considering the situation they aren't over the top at all.  This is de Sica at his best.  Brilliant piece of work and with companion pieces such as Umberto D and The Bicycle Thief one understands what it was de Sica wanted to say.

The product was as offered.  No flaws.  Packaging perfect.  Delivery right on time.  Excellent handling by Amazon.",1352678400,10,1020,4.532967032967033
1785588,5,B00006LPDR,"Heartbreaking indeed.  Masterfully constucted right at the birth of neo realism, this story can be painful to watch.  However, Signor De Sica, as with all of his films, pulls it off with tremendous power and polish.  You'll not see any American film like this.  One of a kind, Shoeshine is a grim and bitter portrayal of downtrodden youth, namely homeless boys just trying to survive.  Not for kids?  Perhaps todays youth should see it.  DVD is most ingratiating with commentary.  Experience it.",1327190400,8,495,4.951219512195122
1785589,5,B00006LPDR,"Everybody loves this film! Seven reviews and all five stars! My crash course in the Italian Neorealismo, which has me watching a classic from the 1940s or '50s every evening, has revealed plenty of disagreement among reviewers about the merits of the tougher films, those that expose the harshness and degradation of lower class life. I guess it should be no surprise that the radical Pier Paolo Pasolini would draw fire; after all, he was murdered by rightwing extremists. But Vittorio de Sica was no radical, and this film is politically innocuous. It's the story of two boys who are earning money shining shoes in American-occupied Italy near the end of World War 2. One boy, the older, is an orphan. The younger boy, his friend, has an intact family with a grown-up brother. That big brother involves the two unsuspecting boys in a robbery; the boys are no angels, of course, and they 'think' they are merely delivering stolen American army blankets to a fence. The resourceful boys have been hoarding their money to buy a horse, and the earnings of their delivery complete the selling price. But joy is brief; the boys are nabbed, questioned, and jailed. Neither of them will 'squeal' on the big brother and his associates. Most of the film is set in a boys' penitentiary that looks like half abandoned church and half Alcatraz. The scenes in the pen are pure Charles Dickens, funny, pitiful, melodramatic in turn. ""Prison makes good boys bad and bad boys worse."" That's hardly a radical revelation.... and then the ending is an effective tear-jerker, which I won't disclose.

In other words, this is ""neorealism"" with a fairly conventional face. A sentimental film about boys in a destructive environment. The police, teh wardens, the judges, and the lawyers are all despicable, sadistic martinets. Who could call that either ""new"" or radical? But it's a good piece of film-making despite its thin content. The boys, not professional actors, are amazingly convincing, both in speech and in movement, which one has to credit to the directorial craft of Vittorio de Sica. The script is tight; in fact, it was nominated for a separate Oscar for screen-writing. The black-and-white photography is crisp and elegant, and this restoration from 2001 has captured its visual beauties. So it seems that ""neorealismo"" wasn't incompatible with fairly straightforward entertainment.",1320278400,18,2376,5.0458015267175576

1785594,5,B00006LPDR,"This film is so groundbreaking, it is difficult to find a place to begin. Shoeshine is a simple film that involves two boys, Giuseppe and Pasquale in 1945 Italy, who manage to get locked up for committing a petty crime. After being imprisoned in a youth detention center, both boys become very disillusioned and bitter over their fate.

Shoeshine has the distinction of being the very first film to win an Academy Award for best foreign film in 1946, when no Academy Awards for foreign films existed! There was not an Academy Awards classification for foreign films until 1956 !! Shoeshine was also well received at the Cannes film festival. The cinematographer, Gianpiero Brunetta remarked that this was quite a statement, since the French still harbored a lot of hostility towards the Italians after the war. Regardless of this animosity, many French film makers embraced the concept of neorealism immediately.

What is a neorealist film? As an amateur, I will do my best to describe what it is, using Shoeshine as an example. A neorealist film uses a natural background as opposed to a studio one. Amateur actors are used and the topic usually involves simple stories in a simple, somewhat impoverished setting. To enhance the simple stories, the use of camera positions and the subject's relationship to the camera are also important factors. For example, Nannarella, a frail little girlfriend of Giuseppe, is filmed walking away from the camera to the other side of the street. In a way, she could represent the rebirth of Italy after having just freed herself from fascism. In another scene, this same girl is seen looking forlorned as her two friends, Giuseppe and Pasquale are being driven away to the youth detention center. Her eyes are fixed on the lens as she is filmed walking towards the camera as the camera moves away from her. It is almost as though the camera lens has become the boys' eyes. There are many other examples of the neorealist style on this film, so I will allow you to discover where they are on your own.

Enjoy this masterpiece!",1277596800,40,2062,4.835694050991502

1785596,5,B00006LPDR,"Vittorio de Sica made unforgettable films but this one, belongs to what I would denominate his golden quartet (Bicycle thief, Shoeshine and Umberto D) which mirror with genuine intensity and beloved humanism the terrible social conditions of his beloved Italy after the WW2. If Rosellini was the tragic Ambassador of this dramatis personae; De Sica always knew to find a smile bellow the pain and the misfortune.

The weird arrival of little boy in the middle of a cabbage patch (as a visible allusion to Moses) by a poor but gentle old lady will become of Toto the good , a very special human being, who will be educated in an orphanage after his adoptive mother passed away, in order to bring cheer to a dreary village of impoverished people, so he will transform their lives through the construction of a shantytown into an almost perfect community, as well as a lot of fortunate events.
