8693124,5,B00QVTG0Y4,"This movie took me away!
  It begins with old King Arthur on his deathbed in Camelot. Guinevere and her son, Galahad, must contend with Arthur's evil sorceress sister, Morgan, who with the help of three dragons intends to take over control of Camelot. Galahad and the last of the remaining knights must go out and find Lancelot, who's been in exile... and then must return to defend Camelot...
  If you're a fan of the legend of Camelot, and dreamy escapes, and AWESOME B movies, then this one is for you. It has an original script and likeable characters, and I found it very entertaining!",1429833600,,590,4.644230769230769
8693125,1,B00QVTG0Y4,"After his death, Arthur's half-sister and enchantress Morgan Le Fay (Sandra Darnell) with her French surname, decides she wants to take over the kingdom. She manages to obtain the help of a dragon by carving runes outside the dragon's cave. In a poorly choreographed mele Morgan breaks Excalibur and imprisons Merlin (Andrew Jarvis) and Guinevere (Selina Giles) for being bad actors. Galahad (James Nitti) narrowly escapes and seeks out his father ""I need a drink"" Lancelot (Mark Griffin) in a script unfortunately borrowed from ""Hercules Reborn.""

I think you know the rest, restore Excalibur,reunite the gang, kill a few dragons, etc. etc.

The acting and dialogue was horrible. They could have at least faked an accent, I could make sport of. The dragons were Asylum grade and the cast was small for ""armies"" of about a dozen people going against each other. But I really couldn't get over the bad acting and dialogue, especially at Arthur's death bed which had me laughing it was MST bad. Another comic aspect was when the dragon bit a guys head off and blood sprays out.

It could be worth watching as a bad cult film along with ""Hercules Reborn"" but not sober or serious.

No swearing or nudity. Brief implied sex.",1418342400,,1220,4.850961538461538
