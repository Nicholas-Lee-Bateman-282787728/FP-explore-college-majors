3171814,5,B0017HRJ04,One of my favorite films of all time.  The bank robbery scene in Heat is featured in GTA.  It makes me appreciate the film even more. AQ really good.,1260316800,,149,4.103448275862069
3171815,2,B0017HRJ04,"This is a great movie, but a terrible blu-ray disk, and a bad release.

The audio is fine, but the video is awful.  The focus is completely off in some scenes.  In a few places, the video visibly jumps in and out of focus.  In other places, the background noise is more animated than the foreground action.  The DVD release up-sampled to 1080p is actually better looking than this disk.

Even without that, several memorable lines have been removed from this version, with editing that makes it pretty obvious in at least one place.

Disappointing.",1260316800,21,548,4.705263157894737
3171816,3,B0017HRJ04,"*EDIT 08-Feb-2017*

A short update in order to add some new information now that the remastered version (which premiered at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn theater in Beverly Hills in Sept of last year) has finally made it out on Blu-Ray (currently in Europe, Japan & the UK, although a U.S release should certainly follow shortly). The original review is still left as-is (sans title), as several other aspects pointed out in it still apply to the new release. Please bear this in mind when reading the complete review.

The most obvious change is the new 4K remaster by Stefan Sonnenfeld (of Company 3). And right off the bat - it is quite stunning when compared to the original 2009 Blu-Ray release. Yes, there are scenes (notably the nighttime cityscapes, and a few others) which are still quite soft, so don't expect ""Collateral"" or even ""Miami Vice"" type clarity on those. But obviously those were shot digitally and can't really compare to the 35mm process used to film Mann's masterpiece.

The audio also gets a DTS HD-MA encode (as opposed to the Dolby TrueHD track which was on the 2009 release.) The audio is very similar to the original mix though (although it might sound slightly lower on some receivers which are not applying the same gain as for a Dolby track). The audio bears a strong resemblance to the Japanese DTS HD-MA version - which was basically a re-encode and had the same deficiencies as the TrueHD track during quiet scenes. Some might argue that it sounds 'better', but frankly that IMO comes down to how your receiver handles DTS vs. Dolby material.

It probably comes as no surprise therefore that it is my view that the audio mix would have benefited greatly if only a little attention was given to it in order to improve clarity in the quiter passages of the film, something which could have been accomplished without ruining the overall dynamics of the track. In lack of a more balanced audio transfer, I'd recommend a 2.5dB audio increase in order to more accurately capture the dialogue (while avoiding clipping in the shootout scenes). It is a film that really deserves a forceful impact, so keeping the audio effects slightly subdued does it somewhat of a disservice.

I had slight hopes that the original theatrical release might be provided alongside the director's approved version via seamless branching on this new version, but it appears it won't see the light of day on the format. :-/ Deducting one star for the audio track and the - IMO - superflous cuts made to it. Although certainly not on a level of, e.g, George Lucas' treatment of the Star Wars franchise, it is revisionistic and should be avoided if at all possible. Movies like all other art forms are a point-in-time snapshot and lose quite a bit of their appeal, and charm, when tinkered with long after their initial release.

2009 review follows. If you are considering purchasing this (and unless you feel as strongly about the edits Mann made to it as I do, you should). Ignore the statements relating to the video as they no longer apply.

This release truly was a gargantuan disappointment. ""Heat"" is one of my all-time favorites and Michael Mann one of my favorite directors. I actually did not have huge expectations to this first incarnation of Heat on Blu-Ray--knowing the problems that exist on both the original 1999 DVD release (which I might add was pretty ok at the time, but not by today's standards) and the subsequent 2005 ""Special Edition"" (which had some interesting extras and commentary, but no change to the feature itself.)

But I mean honestly, I am in awe that not only does this disc have basically _the same_ audio track (re-encoded into Dolby TrueHD)--complete with the same muffled audio which for the most part totally lacks any kind of force, and dialogue which in some places is so low it borders on being ridiculous.
I can honestly say that it had no improvement, whatsoever, over the Japanese DTS edition which was released a couple of years back (which also is far from perfect.)

Ok, granted. The audio is not 100%--that I might be able to live with. After all--this is close to being my favorite movie. However, it also has received a *minimal* upgrade on the video side.

No, I am not referring to the inherent film grain. This disc has many scenes which look like they are taken straight off the original DVD and upscaled to 1080p. The lack of detail is most prominent when pausing the movie at certain scenes. Background detail also varies strongly throughout. Yes, it is a Blu-Ray and obviously it will look better than the DVD but I have a quite respectable stack of older movies which completely puts this release in the dust. The bitrate is for the most part around 15-22Mbit/s, peaking at just under 30 in some cases; but seldom reaching this point.

Just to illustrate that minimal care has been given to the video aspect, note that it even has the _exact same_ color-change problem which occurs after Amy Brenneman's character (Eady) hangs up the phone with McCauley / De Niro (at 54:32)

While this is all bad enough, later on I actually notice that some of the dialogue has been *CUT OUT*. (Why haven't other reviewers noticed this?) Specifically where Diane Venora's character (Justine) is talking to Vincent Hanna / Pacino after the office party has ended. From the passage below, the first part (""you sift through the detritus"") has been omitted(!). I actually had to rewind to verify this, as this kind of thing is pretty unusual, and not something I've noticed on any of the previous DVD versions:

""You sift through the detritus, you read the terrain, you search for signs of passing, for the scent of your prey ... and then you hunt them down. That's the only thing you're committed to. The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.""

Just to make it clear--this was not some one-off problem with my disc or equipment causing it to skip ahead at that particular juncture. No drop-outs to the digital audio signal was witnessed either.

To me, cutting out dialogue (especially something as relevant and beautifully phrased) in such a fashion is completely baffling. I don't know what on earth happened to this release while it was mastered on Blu-Ray, but this just topped it all off and prompted me to eject the disc. I could not bear to see what other flaws or edits it might have been subjected to.

I might add that, never once have I not watched this movie to the end. And I have watched it probably 30 times. But this was truly an abysmal experience. Warner, are you listening? You have plenty of other awe-inspiring releases, and some which are decades older than this one which look (and some which sound) a zillion times better--Superman, North by Northwest, The Road Warrior, Bullitt, The Dirty Dozen--to name a few.

After I submit this review I will create a return request for this item. I urge all others who truly love this movie to do the same; and not put up with what is basically a repackaged & cut version of the original DVD.

What a waste of a truly great disc format.",1259020800,637,7224,4.830097087378641
3171817,5,B0017HRJ04,"HEAT became my favorite film after I first saw it on HBO. Although having it on DVD, I recently bought the Bluray version. While not the sharpest transfer in my collection, the 5.1 audio is superb (clear dialogue; the gunfight after the bank job, the helicopter flyby leading to the face-to-face between Neil and Vincent, and the whining and screaming jets at LAX). Overlooking a few flaws (such as Vincent grabbing a shotgun off a uniformed cop at the hotel without identifying himself), HEAT is true to life, and the covert police techniques equally apply to the intelligence game. It is hard to understand why HEAT didn't make a bigger impact when in theater release.",1258329600,7,670,4.834782608695652
3171818,5,B0017HRJ04,"I firmly believe Heat is the best movie ever made. The relatable and genuine characters drive the compelling and well-paced plot. The action is fresh and breathless, and the heralded shootout at the bank heist is amazing in its violence and complexity.

As a writer myself, what I appreciate most in this movie is the sincerity of the characters and the generally understated way they go about their lives. Conversations are stripped of all excess dialogue, but they are so much richer for it. I credit the ensemble nature of the cast for most of this commendable attribute to the movie. Good supporting actors with only a few minutes of screen time, like John Voight and William Fichtner, are engaging and entirely believable. What I think makes their performances effective is that the actors understand they do not support the movie themselves. Therefore, they can pour themselves into a two-minute scene without having to worry about sustaining that kind of effort over the course of a two-hour movie.

There are many more examples of this, but I will provide three.

When the pursued crew meets up to decide whether to rob a bank, Sizemore's character Cheritto is counseled to drop out of the heist because for someone in his situation it's an unnecessary risk. Sizemore's acting in this scene alone merits an Oscar nomination, even though he only delivers three lines. The emotion on his face, though, speaks paragraphs.

In another scene, Dennis Haysbert's character Donald is propositioned to participate in the bank heist at the last minute. He's on parole and is working a crummy job at a diner, and the temptation to return to the action, the money, and the world of crime that he is familiar with is so clear in his expression. What's also clear is the expression he gives to his internal conflict: He knows what he is doing is wrong, but he acts against it on impulse. By and large, these characters have already made their moral choices and are living with the consequences with a calm resignation.

Finally, Val Kilmer's character Chris goes to his wife after the botched heist. But with a simple gesture of her hand, she waves him off, as she is being surveiled by the police. He recognizes the signal and leaves, presumably never seeing her or his son again. In a gesture, his life is completely changed. What's better, it's done entirely without dialogue.",1258070400,8,2373,4.834975369458128
3171819,5,B0017HRJ04,"Was just checking up on the Blu to verify one of my favorite films was given a decent transfer.

The picture quality was solid, grainy in a few of the night interior shots (Ashley Judd's scenes with the trap house & cops shows some actual pores but when out of focus looks very grainy). The famous shoot out sequence looks valid, but the TrueHD seemed a little muted. The best sound test was when Studi's character shotguns the hotel door - that rocked. Overall, the Blu only shows the shortcomings of original filming but the upgrade is worth it (for the first time I noticed all of the cameramen/crew in the window shot when Deniro kills Fichtner's character).

The supplements are all identical to the special edition release. They show 10 subtitled languages and no region coding listed. I am happy with the cut, and it will play nicely for sharing just not the best for sound. 5 for film, clarity and supplements.",1257552000,11,918,4.625766871165644
3171820,5,B0017HRJ04,"There are precious few movies I even have interest in watching more than once...very few. This is definitely one of them! What a brilliant opus of cinematic work by Mr. Mann! I feel also this is his greatest work, and having the greatest actors of our time in Mr. Pacino and DeNiro has a large part in this. They are in their finest form in this brilliant movie and it truely shows. No greater ""grandstander"" of an actor in Mr. Pacino, and he does deliver indeed in this one as detective Vince Hanna. Mr. DeNiro portraying the crime mastermind is a landmark role of such caliber that is so brilliant it will never be forgotten. VERY few actors could have stood up well against DeNiro in this movie, and Pacino is most assuredly one of the very very few. Own the Blu Ray when it comes out...I am sure it will sell in huge numbers as this gem of a movie has developed an enormous cult following.",1248998400,,893,4.3532934131736525
3171821,5,B0017HRJ04,"Comments made by all the reviewers are right on point! The plot, the characters, the all-star cast, and the acting all warrant viewing this film. Realistically, no one carrys that much ammunition. However, the much talked about shoot-out scene is unparalleled in any action scene.  With added Blu-ray technology, this sequence should be enhanced for further enjoyment. Just keep a set of earplugs handy! I have mine ready for that release date.",1233014400,,444,5.166666666666667
3171822,5,B0017HRJ04,"After watching DeNiro & Pacino in their most recent outing, ""Righteous Kill"", I came to appreciate this film even more although they had more screen time in this one than in ""Heat"", ""Heat"" is still a crime classic in the Warner Bros tradition.  Each character is clearly delinerated and all the situations we see them in are compelling particularly DeNiro's and Pacino's characters--there is never a dull moment in this actioner. The supporting cast of Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Tom Sizemore, and a very young Natalie Portman is excellent and of course Mann's visual style really put us in that mood of doom.  Rather than give away any details of the plot, if you're in the mood for a crime saga--check it out!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray to appear someday. Well to update this review, I purchased the Blu-ray edition on 12/13/09 and it's definitely an improvement over the Standard Def version.  As far as the dialogue being deleted from Diane Venora's monologue--it's just a few word but noticeable.  I don't why Warners did this on the Blu-ray perhaps there should be an explanation of this.  Regardless I'm keeping my disc.",1224028800,3,1143,4.835897435897436

3171866,5,B0017HRJ04,"HEAT [1995 / 2017] [Directors Definitive Edition] [2 Blu-ray Discs] Michael Mann Made His Coolest Film Ever! Michael Mann Shows Two Hollywood Heavyweights Burns As Brightly As Ever!

Oscar winners Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both drive one of the most powerful and complex crime dramas of all time and four-time Oscar nominees Michael Mann's classic HEAT [1995], and arriving in an all-new Director's Definitive Edition from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

In the wake of a precision heist of an armoured van, the crew of a fierce, professional thief [Robert De Niro] and an obsessively driven LAPD detective [Al Pacino] are locked in deadly opposition as they vector towards each other in Mann's dazzling, twilight vision of Los Angeles. As the stakes escalate and their lives begin to unravel, the crew initiates its most dangerous and complex heist.

Taking inspiration from the late Chicago police detective Chuck Adamson, who killed the actual Neil McCauley in a shootout in 1963. HEAT was the culmination of years of research by Michael Mann, resulting in its depth and range of characters and choreography of action. With its epic scale and stunning performances from Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman and Jon Voight. HEAT is as incendiary as it was 20 years ago. HEAT sizzles with hard-hitting action and gripping suspense! The Blu-ray release has been sourced from a NEW 4K Re-mastered negative of the film, supervised by director Michael Mann.

FILM FACT: To make the long shootout more realistic they hired British ex-Special Air Service Special Forces sergeant Andy McNab as a technical weapons trainer and adviser. Andy McNab designed a weapons training curriculum to train the actors for three months using live ammunition before shooting with blanks for the actual take and worked with training them for the bank robbery. Principal photography for HEAT lasted 107 days. All of the shooting was done on location, Michael Mann deciding not to use a soundstage.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: HEAT [1995] is perhaps the ultimate guy bonding type film. Directed by Michael Mann, the film tells the story of two not-so-very-different men. One, an LAPD homicide detective named Lt. Vincent Hanna [Al Pacino], is so consumed by his work that he is failing his third marriage and prowls the streets of Los Angeles like a wolf, stalking those who would do wrong, while his personal life falls into ruin. The other, a professional criminal named Neil McCauley [Robert De Niro] who is simply doing what he knows best, armed robbery and he also lives a lonely existence, making no personal connections that he couldn't walk out on at a moments notice. Neil McCauley and his crew are after one last score a bank heist that could land them more than $12 million. As these two hardened pros go about their business, they gradually become aware of one another predator and prey and each begins to gain a certain respect for the other. But both also know that they're on a collision course: In the end, only one will be left standing.

There are the questions posed by Heat, which uses the predator-versus-prey narrative of expert thief Neil McCauley [Robert De Niro] outrunning dogged Lt. Vincent Hanna [Al Pacino] to explore these remarkably similar archetypes of lone wolf masculinity. Neil McCauley is introspective, self-contained in his alone but not lonely universe, a career criminal with a talent for big money scores. He has an allegiance and understanding with his crew, but no room in his life for any lasting connection. As he says repeatedly, he refuses attachment to anything hes unwilling to walk out on if he feels the heat around the corner.

Vincent Hanna, on the other hand, is explosive and spontaneous. His interrogation of a suspect involves him bursting into song, then musing whether the suspect fell in love last night, then shrieking, Gimme all you got! Gimme all you got! Hes hungry for the chase and working all hours of day and night while his third wife Justine [Diane Venora] passes him on the downward slope of a marriage. Robert De Niro may have the better role, a tragic protagonist whose moral values get pushed to their limit, whereas Al Pacino gets all the best dialogue. But these characters don't know how to do anything else, and don't much want to either. Its a sentiment that lies in the tradition of American individualists. Theres something comforting about applying knowledge to the point where it becomes instinct, and if these guys weren't cops or robbers we could admire them the way we admire the mechanic who fixes our car when its broken down. As Lt. Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley prove time and again, unless you happen to be working with them and speaking their language.

Michael Mann's masterpiece is a 170 minutes crime epic, a love/hate  letter the city of Los Angeles, a scathing Balzacian and literary adjective view of a society corrupt from top to bottom, and a vision of the universe as a space contested over by the fractious armies of crime and the law. Opening with a spectacular armoured-car robbery that degenerates into mass murder, and the film HEAT follows the consequences of the raid, the plans for its successor, the response of the police, led by detective Vincent Hanna and the consequences of it all for wives, families, girlfriends and innocent bystanders.

The cops and the crooks are both constituted like armies, with generals, ranks and special skills assigned and doppelgangers in the opposing team. Michael Mann is less interested in moral questions than in professionalism as a code worth adhering to, no matter which side of the law one finds oneself on. Michael Mann's equal sympathies for both sides are always evident and say he also loves Los Angeles at night, and rarely has it been evoked as beautifully as it is here, as does the film respect the same genre scenario to great effect.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Foxs new Blu-ray disc gives us the ultimate and brilliant 1080p image presentation and especially combined with a spectacular 2.39:1 aspect ratio, and has been remastered from a brand new 4K scan and restoration supervised by Michael Mann himself, and definitely improves over the upon Warner Bros. 2009 Blu-ray image in virtually every bit as good. Something that is obvious right from the start is that the colour timing is much improved and is much more richly saturated now and much more natural also, yet still have that just slightly desaturated look that is true to this films image quality. The night sky and shadows are more truly black in some scenes now. Overall image detail exhibits greater refinement, crisp yet clean looking even given the occasional optical softness and the film was shot with anamorphic lenses, and the grain texture is more subtle and refined. This is a very film-like image, with not a hint of digital filtering. Id love to see how an actual 4K Ultra HD release could improve upon this and its too bad there isn't one. Nevertheless, this is a significant step up visual upgrade.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Foxs new Blu-ray disc, previously offered us a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD mix, but this new edition has instead presented us with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentations. The new mix retains the smooth and natural staging of the previous mix, which turns very lively and dramatic in the action and atmospheric scenes, and adds a bit more oomph and sounds much fuller and even more engrossing, which gives the dramatic staging a bit more ambience sound experience. But when it comes to the dialogue scenes when they talk face to face, slightly annoyed me as they talked so quiet I had to crank the sound up a great deal. But when it comes to the surround sound activity it is very satisfying, with a nice mix, and very good all round speaker activity, especially near the end of the film when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have the cat and mouse shoot out at the airport was totally awesome when the planes come into land, all the speakers are in full swing and you feel the planes are landing in your lounge, it is that realistic and the result is a highly immersive audio presentation and definitely gets a five star rating.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by director Michael Mann: Here Michael man goes straight into talking about the film, and informs us about the first scene we view, which was the Blue line of the Los Angeles MTA [Los Angeles Metro Rail system] and was not open to the public when they shot that scene, and what we witness is actually the end of the line and it was shot two weeks before the official opening of the line. Michael Mann also says that when we start to see the main characters, we get to see an interacting of each character as the film builds up and of course how eventually we see how it all comes together by the end of the film. When we start to see all the criminals coming together at the start of the film, Michael explains that it is all based on real life criminals and their activities. When we first see Jon Voight, Michael mentions why he is called Nate, which relates to a character in the film THIEF who was called Nate Grossman and the character of Sam Grossman was based on Nathan Grossman, the grandfather of a friend of Michael Mann, and is homage to someone who passed away a very long time ago. Michael Mann goes into great detail about all the main characters we get to view as the film progresses and also mentions that his daughter got to interview all the real wives of the criminals that have been portrayed in this film and again Michael Mann slowly reveals a much more in-depth histrionics towards all the main characters in the film to make them sound more realistic, even though they are portraying the real people who the film is based on. Michael also goes into great detail about the scene with local police informer and Michael says they never in real life tell the truth, and the scene with Al Pacino being very intimidating, does it to throw the police informer off balance, so it keeps them in check and hopefully will not have the police come back to interrogate them again, to take the heat off. When you see Al Pacino in the helicopter flying over nigh time in Los Angeles seeking out Robert De Niro on the highway, well Michael Mann states that shots of all the lights looks beautiful, well with one shot of inside the helicopter you see a small TV screen Al Pacino is looking at, well Michael informs us that this technology was perfected for the Vietnam War and is called a FLIR and means Forward Looking Infrared cameras for night time viewing and is typically used on military and civilian aircraft, use a thermographic camera that senses infrared radiation. I personally found Michael Manns audio commentary slightly monotonous and boring, especially half way through the film and near the end of the film with the final shootout with Al Pacino and Robert Di Nero where Michael Mann just states the obvious what we are viewing, in thinking we cannot work out for ourselves what is going on in certain scenes we are viewing. I just wish Michael Mann would stop talking for a while and gather his thoughts and speak again when something more interesting appears in the film that he can divulge some more interesting information about the film and the reason he shot a particular scene or the concept of what his audiences wanted to view. Personally I would have to only give a two star rating for this Michael Mann audio commentary.

Special Feature: Filmmaker Panels: Here we get to view two very interesting individual special features and they are as follows:

01. 2016 Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences Panel [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [63:00] The Academys Samuel Goldwyn Theater was rocked with the sounds of applause and high-octane action on 7th September, 2016 when the cast and crew of the epic crime film HEAT were reunited for a look at the making of this Los Angeles film milestone and they had just all viewed the film HEAT and thirteen people are welcomed onto the stage who were all involved with the film and is moderated by Christopher Nolan [Director] who was greeted by a very enthusiastic sold-out crowd. I have no idea why they invited Robert De Niro, as he is the most boring person in the world and most the time he just sits there looking like he wished he had not been invited as he is useless. Unfortunately Val Kilmer had an infected swollen tongue and he had a terrible job trying to speak or to be understood and he sounded like the cartoon character Donald Duck. All in all this was a fascinating watch and very informative, especially from the guests on the stage, but sadly out of the twelve guests on the stage, sadly there were one or two of them did not get asked any questions, which is a shame. But despite this, it was a really interesting and fascinating session. Contributors include: Al Pacino [Actor], Robert De Niro [Actor], Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Amy Brenneman [Actress], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], William Goldenberg [Editor], Val Kilmer [Actor], Art Linson [Producer], Andy Nelson [Re-recording Mixer], Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer], Diane Venora [Actress] and Mykelti Williamson [Actor].

02. 2015 Toronto International Film Festival [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [30:27]. One of the most ground-breaking crime dramas of its time, the film HEAT celebrated its 20th anniversary at the Toronto International Film Festival with a screening of the film in a new 35mm print followed by a Q&A session with the director Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], and was moderated by Jesse Wente. Michael Mann talks about how the film came about, which related to a real life crime incident in 1963 via one of Michael Manns friend Chuck Adamson [Former Chicago Police Officer] about the story of the notorious Neil McCauley criminal. In 1963, detective Chuck Adamson sat down in a Chicago coffee shop with a convicted bank robber. Rail thin and with careworn features, career criminal Neil McCauley had spent some 25 of his 49 years in and out of prison for a string of crimes ranging from theft to murder. But in spite of his repeated brushes with the law, Neil McCauley had no intention of going straight and with meeting with Michael Mann and Chuck Adamson, started the ball rolling that helped to bring us the awesome film HEAT. Although this special feature is just over 30 minutes, it sure packs a lot fascinating information about the making of the film and interesting anecdotes from Michael Mann and is well worth viewing.

Special Feature: The Making of HEAT [2005] [1080i] [1.37:1] [59:12] Here we have the original documentary which is from the original inferior DVD, and it is split into three separate small documentaries on their own merit and they are TRUE CRIME; CRIME STORIES and INTO THE FIRE. A lot of ground is covered in this thorough and fascinating documentary about the making of the film HEAT. The origin and fruition of the story and film is explained in great detail, as well as the overall love shared for this project by everyone involved through the many interviews with cast and crew members and we also get to view a plethora of film clips from the film HEAT. I really enjoy these kinds of making-of features, so this was right up my alley. Contributors include: Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Chuck Adamson [Former Chicago Police Officer], Richard Lindberg [Author/Chicago Historian], Dennis Farina [Actor/Former Chicago Police Officer], Al Pacino [Actor/Vincent Hanna], Tom Elfmont [Technical Advisor/L.A.P.D.], Rey Verdugo [Technical Advisor/L.A. Sheriffs Dept.], Jon Voight [Actor/Nate], Robert De Niro [Actor/Neil McCauley] (archive footage), Val Kilmer [Actor/Chris Shiherlis], Edward Bunker [Author: No Beast So Fierce], Dennis Haysbert [Actor/Breedan], Tom Sizemore [Actor/Michael Cheritto], Michael Waxman [First Assistant Director], Art Linson [Producer], Amy Brenneman [Actress/Eady], Mykelti Williamson [Actor/Drucker], Ami Canaan Mann [Second Unit Director], Bonnie Timmermann [Casting Director], Tom Noonan [Actor/Kelso], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer], Ashley Judd [Actress/Charlene Shiherlis], Diane Venora [Actress/Justine Hanna], Tom Elfmont [Technical Advisor/L.A.P.D.], Andy McNab [Technical Weapons Trainer], Danny Trejo [Actor/Trejo], Michael ""Mick"" Gould [Technical Weapons Trainer], Neil Spisak [Film Production Designer], Chris Jenkins [Sound Mixer Engineer], Elliot Goldenthal [American Composer] and Moby [American Musician].

Special Feature: Pacino and De Niro: The Conversation [2005] [1080i] [1.37:1] [9:59] Here we take a closer look at the diner scene that features the two leading male actors. The ghastly pan-and-scan released version of the film HEAT that was originally released on VHS back in the 1990s led some people to think the actors were filmed separately and did not appear together onscreen in this restaurant scene, but thankfully those days of visually butchered films are long gone and this time Michael Mann explains how they filmed that very intense scene and both actors their performance without a rehearsal, as they felt it would be much more natural performance and it is definitely a tour de force performance. Contributors include: Jon Voight [Actor/Nate], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Robert De Niro [Actor/Neil McCauley] (archive footage), Art Linson [Producer], James Wolcott [American Film Critic/Journalist], Al Pacino [Actor/Vincent Hanna], Ashley Judd [Actress/Charlene Shiherlis], Tom Sizemore [Actor/Michael Cheritto] and Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer].

Special Feature: HEAT: Return to the Scene of the Crime [2005] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:05] Here we take a visit to the Los Angeles locations used in the film HEAT. Location manager Janice Polley and associate producer Gusmano Cesaretti helm this absorbing feature in which they discuss the photography and locales that Michael Mann utilised in the film. The pair gushes over Michael Mann's talent, but they also touch on plenty of topics that aren't explored elsewhere on this Blu-ray disc. What was interesting is that they go back to certain locations that were pivotal to the film and why they were used, which got the green light from Michael Mann and with each location we get clips from the film that relates to the modern day locations, but of course a lot of the locations in Los Angeles have changed dramatically since 1995. One aspect of a certain location that I found interesting, where they filmed the final showdown shoot out at the airport, which had to be filmed at midnight and they say what they did could not be filmed today, as there are too many safety issues, especially where Robert De Niro had to run in front of a Jumbo jet that had just landed. Contributors include: Janice Polley [Location Manager/Scout], Gusmano Cesaretti [Associate Producer], Jayne Mazzochi [Resident] and Lisa Glucksmann [Restaurant Worker].

Special Feature: Additional Footage: Deleted Scenes [2005] [480p] [1.37:1] [9:44] Here we get to view a total of 11 deleted scenes, and they are as follows: SCENE 5: SEASONS STARTING EARLY; SCENE 42: NICEST GUY ON THE BLOCK; SCENE 55: ALBERT AND HANNA [ALTERNATE TAKE]; SCENE 62: SHAKEDOWN; SCENE 76: MURDER IN C-BLOCK; SCENE 96A: LETS DAMCE; SCENE 125: LATE ARIVAL; SCENE 148/147: WHERES ANNA; SCENE 177B: DOUBLE THE WORST TROUBLE; SCENE 191: NATE DELIVERS and SCENE 204A: NO RESPONSE. When viewed in the context of the finished product, they offer a nice lesson into how editing shapes a film of this calibre and how little things can have a big impact. Note that the temporary music was used, so they don't reflect the final score for those scenes, had they been included. As usual, you can either watch each one individually or Play All.

Theatrical Trailers [2005 [1080i] [1.37:1] [6:48] Here you get to view three excellent and dramatic Original Theatrical Trailers, that were entitled as follows: SURPRISE OF A LIFETIME; TWO ACTORS COLLIDE and CLOSING IN. As usual, you can either watch each trailer separately or Play All.

Finally, if you haven't picked up HEAT before, or you feel you want to upgrade your inferior DVD, this is a totally worthwhile purchase, especially since you can find it very cheap now in lots of outlets. Ive said it before and it bears repeating: Heat is just a great film that I cant speak of more highly. I wish this new edition was available in 4K Ultra HD, but even so the restoration is impressive and the hour of added bonus content is a nice treat. If youve never seen Heat before, this is absolutely the version you want to buy on Blu-ray. If you're already a fan and you have the previous edition, my advice is to sell it and upgrade immediately, as it is even more worthwhile upgrading this brilliant action packed film, even for those who have the earlier Blu-ray release. Very Highly Recommended!

3171889,5,B0017HRJ04,"Billed as ""A Los Angeles Crime Saga,"" ""Heat"" is one of the finest crime dramas ever to come out of Hollywood. Now newly reissued in a Directors Cut edition on Blu-ray, this the story of Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), two charismatic men on opposite sides of the law. With its two superstar co-lead actors (Pacino and De Niro), and an equally outstanding supporting cast that includes Diane Venora, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, and Val Kilmer, this movie provides nearly three hours of spine-tingling suspense and superb action.

""Heat"" abounds with fantastic action scenes, culminating in a bank heist and shootout between Neil McCauley's gang of bank robbers and Vincent Hanna's squad of police detectives. In the immediate aftermath of the heist are found the best action sequences in the entire film. I think they rank among the best action scenes in any movie of recent years. The battle between McCauleys automatic weapons-wielding crew and dozens of Hannas equally well-armed police officers, fought over several city blocks, takes on the grim, fiery reality of urban combat. This scene is grand in its scope, perfectly executed, and positively gripping to watch.

The acting in ""Heat"" is uniformly superb. as one might expect with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro leading the cast. Each of these actors plays his part to perfection  Pacino, angst-ridden, hard-as-nails, slightly burned out, yet totally dedicated to stopping and apprehending Neil McCauley and his gang; and De Niro, coldly calculating, soft spoken, betraying no outward hint of his violent nature, a man alone in the world

Perhaps the most interesting scene in ""Heat"" occurs when Vince Hanna and Neil McCauley sit down in a caf for a cup of coffee. This scene, rated by ""TV Guide"" as one of the 50 best movie scenes of all time, was the first time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro had ever acted together in the same scene. It is simply a marvelous display of acting by two of the best actors of their generation...

""Heat"" is one of my all-time favorite movies of any genre. Most highly recommended.",1505347200,5,2101,4.923728813559322

- Action
- Suspense
- Character development
- Visually excellent (maybe Michael Mann went a little overboard with the night-light scenes of LA, but the scenes are striking)
- Fantastic acting. Especially the tension between the DeNiro & Pacino characters as they try to outwit each other. The ""cuppa' coffee meeting"" is one of the best scenes ever between two actors.

Almost 3 hours long - but it doesn't feel like it at all!",1501977600,,444,4.6923076923076925

A few story lines and then BAM they all collide towards the end of the movie.  Lots of action and Michael Mann is still the best on night scenes.  He just knows how to shoot them.

The way Mann conveys the mood and feeling just grabs me. The lighting, locations, and most important the cast. If De Niro had played next to anyone else than Pacino he would have smothered him and same goes for Pacino. The soundtrack of this movie is amazing, it really helps bring you in and assists the conveyance of mood. The character development makes you feel for each side, and makes me feel that I've known McCauley and Hanna for some time. I think most of us have feelings from both sides of this movie. I think that's why I'm so drawn to this movie. Its like I'm on the dividing line of good and evil, and this movie shows that people, real people reside on both sides.",1484179200,7,745,4.283687943262412

3172082,5,B0017HRJ04,"Heat is probably the last role Al Pacino took before his mind collapsed. You see flashes of the incipient lunatic emerge in one or two scenes (""She has a GREAT ASS!!!!"") but he's still capable of a subtlety that he would abandon shortly thereafter. Similarly with Deniro, he hasn't yet descended into the ""I'll take any role for a paycheck"" mindset that would come upon him soon afterwards. Heat is among my favorite movies because it doesn't overreach. An odd thing to say about a movie with a nearly 3 hour runtime, but Michael Mann knows what he's doing and the story has little enough fat. There are elements, indeed some whole storylines, that aren't strictly necessary to tell the cops-and-robbers tale that is the movie's kernel, but these flesh out the film in a way that feels organic. For a movie that's better than 2 decades old, Heat still feels rather fresh because it is essentially a character study in the framework of a shoot 'em up.",1459209600,2,950,4.660714285714286

3172110,5,B0017HRJ04,"This film is exceptional. Almost all crime films are biased in their portrayal of cops vs robbers. If the cop is the main character, the criminals are snatching babies or just generally being evil and *incompetent*. If the bad guys are the main characters, it's a horror movie. Finally, this is a movie where both sides are experts and they're both like-able. As such, I never knew which way the film was going to end.

Both sides have just as much likelihood to win in the end and I could realistically get behind either side. This film kept me on the edge and seemed so much more realistic about the criminals. They weren't just bad guys for the sake of it. They didn't have the clichs of having ""henchmen"" and having a taste for fine art.

A masterpiece in noir and intricate storytelling, Michael Mann and his crew prove why the vibe they conveyed in Miami Vice still holds a lot of sway over American culture to this day.

Oh, did I mention Pacino and DeNiro deliver? Need you any other reason besides the presence of two masters in method acting in opposing roles? LA never looked so foreboding and the cinematography of the night shots is more reminiscent of a rock and roll video from the old days than it is of reality. Incredibly well done.

3172203,3,B0017HRJ04,"Shocked..... Just shocked.... I couldn't believe how mediocre of a film this was. With such an A list cast this movie easily underperforms and was, frankly, a pretty dull and mildly painful watching experience.

So this was Al Pacino vs. Robert De Niro in a nutshell. And thanks to some lackluster writing and, honestly, some lackluster acting this movie just didn't work for me. Yes, I am seeing this 20 years after the fact and times have most certainly changed, but this film was quite average. The gun fight scenes were near ridiculous with implausible escapes and middling tension. Although the tension issue was due mostly to the poor foreshadowing. It was almost like they were telling you what was going to happen. If someone was trying to start a new life, dead. Told to get out of the business, dead! It was really rather upsetting as I've heard so many great things about this movie.

OK, so the acting... I've got to start out by saying that Scarface was and still is one of my favorite movies, but Pacino just showed up for a paycheck in this one. I can't be sure whether it was the writing or he just didn't care, but man, the lines were bad. He had some gems in this one, ""Show me what ya got"", ""when I see a woman's ass, something comes out of me""! And these are real lines and he's screaming each and every one of them.... De Niro was better, but he couldn't Atlas this movie on his shoulders.

I've heard that the script was actually held on a shelf for around 10 years before this movie was made. I'm thinking it should have stayed a little longer. Some random scenes helped fill out the extra hour (yes it's a 3 hour movie). Pacino is dealing with woman trouble due to his work dedication and struggles to synch with his rebellious teen stepdaughter. De Niro is the criminal looking for love, but doesn't want to roll the dice because of his crook ways. Blah, blah, blah... Seriously though, here are some scenes. Because they are both super intelligent in there respective areas, they literally jump between cutscenes almost finishing each others sentences. De Niro decides he needs to get a new passport because the heat is on, next scene, Pacino says to look for De Niro to get a new passport. Pacino figures out he's been ""made"" the second before De Niro snaps a picture of him. It truly goes on and on with those equally smart shots....

*Sigh*, just upsetting.... I really wanted to enjoy this one. I might be a little harsh here, but I don't think I am. It's worth a watch, but this one has been overhyped and doesn't deserve the high 4 1/2 star rating it currently has. If people went back and rewatched this one, I would hope they'd come to the same conclusion I have. This movie is middle of the road.",1425686400,,2731,4.466933867735471
3172204,5,B0017HRJ04,"I don't know why this movie doesn't get brought up more often when people talk about the great roles from Pacino and De Niro, but maybe that speaks more to the level of films they've been involved with in the past than this particular film.

The plot was complex enough that you can't write this off as just another mindless action movie, but simple enough that you don't have pay attention to the smallest detail. Basically, you get out of this film what you put into it. Loved it, and would definitely watch again.",1425600000,,516,4.48936170212766

3172243,5,B0017HRJ04,"A great Robert De Niro and Al Pacino collaboration!!!!This is what the film,Heat,a written and directed by Michael Mann,is all about.

De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional thief, while Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, veteran LAPD homicide detective tracking down McCauley's crew. The central conflict was based on the experiences of former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson and his pursuit in the 1960s of a criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. Aside from De Niro and Pacino,the film also has an all-star ensemble that includes Val Kilmer, Jon Voight,Tom Sizemore,Diane Venora,Amy Brenneman,Ashley Judd and a young Natalie Portman - that makes the performances of this film first class.

It is more than just a story of a police and criminal playing the cat- and-mouse game. The tension and conflict provided by the story definitely is far from contrived as it is honest and totally realistic. Aside from the good performances,credit also should be given to Mann.

Heat is just more than an action film. It is simply one of the best crime thrillers ever made in Hollywood. It is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's if not the best.",1418774400,2,1179,4.974619289340102

I've learned to appreciate Michael Mann. I've become less critical at this point. I don't need to see shootings and gun play all the time in a crime movie. Character development and small character moments are excellent.

Upon re-watching this movie, I do find that I appreciate the moments that I appreciated the first time. Michael Mann loves Los Angeles and loves filming Los Angeles in the night when it's particularly spooky. The scene between DeNiro and Al Pacino is a landmark in film history (and cannot be exceeded by the movie where they were together in almost every scene). There are even some genuinely fascinating moments like Hank Azaria doing a Quentin Tarantino impression and cameos by Henry Rollins and Dany Trejo.

But overall, this movie is way too long. It seems to be leading up to a bank heist but then that's over and there's still an hour left to go. By that point, it just seems like everyone stops dead in their tracks in order to drag out the narrative even longer.

I know people love this movie and I can see some of the appeal, but there's a lot of moodiness without much payoff over all.",1408838400,,1264,4.584070796460177

3172294,2,B0017HRJ04,"Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) is a clear example of style over substance. While visually appealing and atmospheric (it's Mann we're talking about!), I feel that this film lacks true depth and goes nowhere. ""Heat"" is an epic crime drama that stars acting legends Al Pacino (as good guy cop Lt. Vincent Hanna) and Robert DeNiro (as bad guy expert thief Neil McCauley), but I feel that much of this film's acclaim is simply based on the weight of their resumes and not on the actual content that both actors contribute to the film. Pacino plays his role WAY over the top, while DeNiro UNDERPLAYS his role too much. 2 performances at opposite (and monotonous) ends of the acting spectrum. After the 2 main stars, there is a varying degree of poor to good performances scattered about.

Examples of The GOOD? The actors playing Vincent's subordinates: Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi , and Ted Levine were very good. These actors really seemed like cops and watching them operate looked very realistic. But, sadly, they were overshadowed by Pacino's histrionics. Additionally, a teen-aged Natalie Portman is a scene-stealer as Hanna's troubled stepdaughter, as is Kevin Gage as Waingro, a psychopathic member of Neil's team. And of course the film is beautiful to look at it, with the typical Mann cinematic flourishes of bright colors and scenic views of Los Angeles.

Examples of the POOR? The members of Neil's team, played by Val Kilmer (Shiherlis), Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo, were all interchangeable characters. The cops being straight-laced make total sense, but the criminals' were much too methodical to be believed as bad guys, especially given some of the horrific crimes they were committing. Also poorly characterized were most of the main female characters! Diane Venora (as Vincent's wife), Amy Brenneman (as Neil's girlfriend), and Ashley Judd (as Shiherlis' wife) were very one-note and hard to gauge. They all seemed like the same character. In reality, Mann populated this film with a bunch of actors just to add to it's epic appeal without giving most of them any real depth. And the ones I just mentioned aren't even HALF of the cast given significant screen time! There are literally about a dozen or so more actors thrown in the mix, all incredibly one-dimensional and non-descript. I also have a major nitpick with the final music used at the ending credits, because it is a complete ripoff of the score to the movie ""Starman"" from 1984. Not an original score!

The plot of ""Heat"" is very by-the-numbers with McCauley's gang getting away with crime after crime, while the LAPD trudges through the entire film with their tails between their legs, basically waiting for a BIG crime to be committed, while innocent people get caught in the crossfire along the way. The movie has too many preachy, speechifying moments where ALL characters have cathartic moments, when in reality, it would be more likely that perhaps 1 or 2 would have such moments. The big Pacino-DeNiro scene at the midway point is absolutely nothing to write home about! They've both done MUCH better work, even in some of their lesser-known efforts in their careers. Clocking in at almost THREE hours, ""Heat"" is a very depressing tale despite the vividness of it's appearance. The ending, in my opinion, is far from satisfying, with some very questionable moments.

I believe that Mann did a much greater job with films in the crime genre like ""Collateral"" (my personal favorite film of his, and in my opinion, his best film) and ""Manhunter"" (another classic) where the films were visually stunning, stylish, BUT ALSO superbly scripted and acted. Those films leave a lasting impression. ""Heat"" not so much!",1405468800,2,3691,4.987012987012987

The film's director, Michael Mann, clearly took his time filming this movie to get the best performances from his actors, which resulted in one of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best ever. In my mind Heat is the best heist movie ever made, but moreover it is one of the best crime dramas ever made. It is an incredibly deep film that was profoundly thorough in it's character development.

For each of the major characters in the film we were introduced to their personal lives, learning more about them. This made us care that much more about these characters and eventually what would happen to them. The current blu-ray needs an update, this was a pretty generic release with mediocre HD quality, maybe in 2015 they will release a 20th anniversary edition with a remastered print.",1403308800,12,877,4.585987261146497

3172299,3,B0017HRJ04,"Heat is not above criticism. I've put off reviewing this film for a long time as I know any negative comments will provoke an angry response from people who are blind to any faults. It's a good film, but it is far from perfect.

Pacino and DeNiro are cop and crook who go head-to-head over a major heist. They have many similarities, and could otherwise have been friends, only they are on opposite sides of the same coin - both cerebral, cunning, and crafty. Attempts at juxtaposing their lives come across as a little indulgent, but it's a crime epic, with lots of characters and cameos, so the running time has to be filled-up with something.

I just wish the dialogue wasn't so clipped and the editing so inconsistent. The movie has a naturalistic feel, meaning a lot words sound mumbled, and characters seems to come and go with no orientation given to the viewer. I am not saying that Michael Mann should pander to all audiences and dumb down the material, but a middle ground could have been found.

Mann shoots LA with wide-open empty spaces and stays high above the city for the most part, giving it a cold, alienating feel. Dante Spinotti's photography is raw and filter-free, and all locations are real with not a single soundstage used (although there are a couple of obvious green screen shots). It gives you a view of LA not typically seen in movies.

For a 170-minute it doesn't pay-off much considering the talent. There is a great 125-minute movie desperate to get out of Heat. The movie as it is has a lot of fat and you'll have to endure it if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

The Blu-ray is very underwhelming in 2.40:1 1080p with lots of weak blacks and a general DVD feel to it. For such a lauded and successful film Warner's effort here is very poor. The sound fares better in Dolby TrueHD (remember that?) and there are ZERO extras.",1402790400,,1868,4.498525073746313

3172315,5,B0017HRJ04,"One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",1396915200,9,923,4.566265060240964

Not certain why the language is what it is, but I suppose screenwriters feel actors aren't real unless they curse often.  I loved the coffee shop scene and the last scene at the airport is classic.  I'm still wondering how many cops would hold the hand of a man responsible for killing several of his fellow cops.

-It's just a blue screen with a jumble of tiny text. On the plus side, there weren't a bevy of annoying FBI warnings or un-skippable trailers.

Poor Extras
-Just a few interviews and commentaries. They seem to have been recorded right after the film's original release, and are poorly scanned 4:3 480p SD. For instance, they'll have an interview boxed to fit 4:3, then cut to a letter-boxed scene from the film, leaving two-thirds of the screen black.

Lazy Transfer
-Heat's visuals have a high dynamic range, and it (generally) looks great on a properly adjusted TV. But there are a few problems with the transfer to HD. Most notably, I could see a flickering between the flesh-tones of Pacino and Di Niro's faces during their famous cup of coffee. Distracting, but not a show-stopper.

3172362,5,B0017HRJ04,"10 years after the release of Michael Mann's epic crime tour de force, Heat is still an absolute masterpiece. Originally a screenplay which sat on the shelf for almost twenty years before being greenlit, Heat is the perfect character driven crime drama. Mann pits Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a dueling cop and crook whose lives bear stunning resemblances to themselves. Vincent (Pacino) becomes obsessed in his case to help escape the reality of his failing marriage, while Neil (De Niro) is a cool, calm, collected and disciplined master thief who, with his skilled team (including Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) are planning a heist which will change everyone involved forever. This portrait of these people and their failing personal lives sacrificed for their obsessive careers makes Heat the best film to come from Mann, and undoubtadly the best big budget crime drama to come out of the 90's. The face off between Pacino and De Niro is a film buff's dream, and the climactic LA shootout is possibly one of the best action sequences in cinematic history. The rest of the cast, which includes Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Kevin Gage, Denis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, Tom Noonan, and Hank Azaria, does brilliant work. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. This new 2-disc Special Edition from Warner Bros. contains a great commentary from Mann and a few nice featurettes, but the deleted scenes are hardly worth watching and add nothing to the film.",1376956800,33,1561,5.054263565891473
3172363,5,B0017HRJ04,"This is a fine action film.  The robbery scenes are taut, and the gun fighting is entirely unlike Hollywood's usual fare--in other words, realistic.  We also are treated to the first time that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear together on screen.  The two of them, portraying intense characters facing off over coffee while realizing that they also are more alike than someone who isn't a skillful thief or a dedicated police officer would want to admit.

But more than that, Heat is a tragedy.  Since that word is often misused, I'll explain that a tragedy is a drama in which the tragic hero comes to a bad end due to a flaw in his character.  Heat is Elizabethan tragedy.  If you know Shakespeare, you'll realize how many bodies that means.  In Hollywood, there are few genuine examples of this art form.  The weaving together of these characters' lives into one tight fall will provide the catharsis that powerful tragedy promises.

3172375,3,B0017HRJ04,"Again, here I am only reviewing the Blu Ray DVD treatment of Michael Mann's epic crime masterpiece, Heat.  This is one of my favorite films, and I am disappointed and confounded by the quality of the transfer.  The video is decent at best; the film is, in its original nature, very desaturated with a decent amount of natural film grain.  But what is the deal with the sound?  The audio is so unbelievably quiet, especially during dialogue!  While watching, I had the sound coming out of the TV's crappy default speakers, and a decent virtual surround sound speaker unit w/subwoofer.  During a scene with just dialogue and no music, I tried listening to how it sounded on just the TV's sound, and kept on increasing the volume to its absolute max - and it was still relatively quiet!  Then, only when I unmuted the surround and jacked its volume to the max did it sound only just competent!  This is absurd; I have watched other Blu Rays with the volume at a minimum and the audio's fidelity was crisp, dynamic and loud, just as it should be.  But not on this one.  It pisses me off because I wanted to experience this one as if I was in the theatre (especially for that brilliant shootout scene!) but I just couldn't get enough out of the audio.  Such an inexplicable fault; it should not be like this; it sounds exactly like its first lame DVD transfer from like back in '98, which is inexcusable.",1375142400,9,1399,4.490118577075099

As the Crew exits the Bank, is where one should turn up the volume. Very powerful. It lasts about 10 minutes. Excellently done, by Director Ed Mann. He was meticulous with the shootout scene. He spent about 9 days getting it perfectly done. Also, the background music adds to the build-up of excitement. The entire movie was very well done.

3172384,5,B0017HRJ04,"Wow! De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer... this was a movie I resisted seeing and don't ask me why. I was very surprised with the actors, who are all great, and the story line. De Niro was at his best at being the bad/good guy who is only doing a job when they find a place to hit. He insists on his crew being methodical with as little interaction with people as possible, not wanting to get the police overly excited about just another robbery. This all goes horribly wrong with the admission of a psychotic ex con into their group that throws a wrench into their plans.  Enter Pacino, a dedicated at times overly excited detective(and no one plays excited like Pacino)that is determined to follow every lead that comes his way to stop the crew. De Niro is great as the head of the Crew and sad in may ways because of the life he leads and at one point realizes it. Although Jon Voight has a small part in the movie, it is essential to the plot and he is wonderful in his interaction with DeNiro. Val Kilmer is great as a member of the Crew that is very much in love with his wife and child although he has done the family life more harm than good but wants to do better. The entire plot appears to be a bit convoluted because of the many side plots involving the family of both the Crew and Pacino but somehow all fits together. Pacino and DeNiro do have a face to face after they discover each other and they learn they are not that different in their way of thinking if not their way of life. It is probably the best scene in the entire movie. This is one movie that deserved far more attention than it got and made me wonder why I waited so long to see it.",1373587200,,1651,4.159375

3172389,5,B0017HRJ04,"Michael Mann is probably the most stylish director on the planet. He's an expert at building hypnotic tension into a movie. His sense of technical style is strong and it reflects in his films. heat especially. His movies are always gritty and realistic. Mann is to the action and thriller genre what Oliver Stone is to the political drama. Mann directs his films like they are serious business. Like he's an FBI agent out to solve a murder case. Serious, determined & dangerous. Heat is a perfect example of all of these Mann qualities rolled into one. The action sequences are powerful and breathtaking. The pace is slick and heartstopping during these sequences and the music during these moments keep the tension pounding at nail biting glory. Music is an important element in any Mann movie, and here Michael Mann expertly places each composition right up till the end credits when he uses a track by Moby to run into the credits. Music is so important for the flow of many Mann movies, and here it is so central that it might as well be one of the characters in the movie. As usual Pacino and De Niro turn in perfect performances. Note worthy and interesting also are Ted Levine, who played the killer in Silence of the lambs as one of investigating cops here, and the small cameo by Tom Noonan, who played the killer in Mann's film Manhunter. Both films were versions of the Thomas Harris novel Silence of the lambs. And the actors who played the killers in both films are featured in this movie. Though Heat does at times feel a bit long and slow, it can be forgiven because there is plenty of style and action to keep you interested. The plot and characters are all pretty interesting as well.

3172412,5,B0017HRJ04,"After more than 15 years, Heat still stands head and shoulders above the rest as one of the premier films in the genre. De Niro and Pacino are perfectly matched as driven professionals and polar opposites. The compelling irony of the movie is the intimation that the two would, in a different world, be friends and compatriots, as illustrated in their coffee shop scene.
Heat is a non-stop, action packed foray into a sort of spectator Stockholm syndrome that draws the viewer sympathetically into the lives of antagonist De Niro and his crew. There is so much focus on the bad guys that the line between Pacino's side and De Niro's is blurred all the way until the end.
Heat relies on fairly straightforward plot and action with no major surprise twists. Yet there is enough going on in the story to require the viewer to pay attention to events; it's easy to lose track of the sequence that progresses from start to finish.
Moby's presence throughout the soundtrack sharply enhances the film's gripping dramatic appeal. Heat's only downside for me is the inclusion of the the ever-smarmy and self-righteous Ashley Judd in the cast. But the rest of the actors and the characters they play are enough to pull attention away from her typically smug performance.
Heat is a must-have in your DVD or Blu-ray collection.",1365033600,,1315,4.797356828193832

They've taken a couple robberies, probably from old TV shows, and stretched them into three hours with a lot of irrelevant scenes like people sitting in bars or pulling up in cars. The stellar cast is totally wasted; Voight & Kilmer only have a few lines, Pacino's crude arrogant belligerence is a total turn-off. There are too many characters to get interested in any of them.  No thought was put into any of the robberies, they were pulled off with brute force.

The film delves into the thoughts and lifestyles of both a dedicated officer and a career criminal.  Heat is a brilliant and epic crime drama.

The story in Heat places characters and story before action; therefore, don't expect 2 hours and 45 minutes of action-packed shootouts and chases. The characters, however, are deep and the dialogue is immersive. It all builds up to a monumental and benchmark heist scene that will keep you at your edge of your seat; this scene plays out so well thanks to the great choreography and editing. The ending of the film was also intense. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were magnificent, and so was the amazing supporting cast. I also enjoyed the music, particularly the credits song.

Overall, Heat is an amazing crime film, with a great cast, a superb story, and a brilliant, must-watch heist. I highly recommend a purchase.

3172428,5,B0017HRJ04,"The earliest memory I have for this movie was when I saw the famous shootout scene playing on a bunch of TVs in a Radio Shack in a shopping mall. The first time I saw the movie in its entirety was when I bought the double-disk DVD after watching the famous shootout clip again on youtube about six years ago or so. And it was worth every penny. It is a novel of a movie full of deep and interesting characters. The story is about about a cop and a thief. The cop is Lt. Vincent Hannah played by Al Pacino. An LAPD detective in the prestigious Robbery-Homicide Unit. He is in-charge of the detectives who investigate career criminal Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro and his crew of ex-cons doing all that they know how. Taking down scores and pulling heists. But when they rob an armored car and take bearer bonds belonging to a sleazy businessman named Van Zandt, they find themselves involved in a world of cheats and liars and backstabbers. Mr. Pacino and Mr. De Niro are the main focus of the film, as the movie is mostly about their duality. They see the other as the opposite side of the same coin. The minor characters are anything but minor. Waingro is a sociopath who loves to kill. He plays a very important part to the film's plot, especially for Neil's part of story. Other actors/actresses include Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Dennis Haysbert, Danny Trejo, Jon Voight, Amy Brennaman, Natalie Portman, Willam Fitchner, Wes Studi and more if I had left any out.
In conclusion, Heat is an elaborate tale of Cops & Robbers told from the point of view of the police, the criminals, their families, their friends and even their enemies. It is a story of people living their lives in the grand city of Los Angeles and dealing with everyday struggles of money, marriage/relationships, loyalty, trust and work. And it is about two people who carry guns for living. Except one of them wears a badge and the other wears a ski-mask.",1358640000,,1935,4.531428571428571

Now on to the video portion, it looks fantastic, I didn't see any grain what so ever, one scene that I always noticed the grain on with the DVD was when Hannah was having Neil followed by the chopper on the freeway, it looked quite bad, but on this blu ray, I saw NONE of that, so I was pleased with that, and the picture has nice detail to it, especially the shots of Los Angeles, especially during the shootout scene, I can see why Christopher Nolan was influenced by this movie when filming 'The Dark Knight'.

So thats my review, I didn't want to review the movie because fans of the movie already know this is a classic crime-drama, NOT ACTION, although it has quite a bit of action as well, it is a crime-drama, and a classic one at that, my focus was on the transfer itself, and like I said, yeah the audio could use some work, but as long as you don't mind turning it up, this is definetly worth purchasing, big advantage over the DVD, although the DVD does have a louder audio track, but the video on this one is so much better.

And all I had was the single disc edition DVD, so I was delighted to see that this blu ray comes with all the features that were featured on the 2 disc DVD, since I always wanted that version but never could find it around here, so that sweetened the pot for me.

Excellent movie to see on blu ray, if you are a fan, this should be purchased!",1354147200,,1941,4.060052219321149

He did a super job with this part, and if it had been better written he may have been nominated for an acting award. There is a hint of a subplot that goes no where. The way in which Waingro kills a hooker is poorly thought out and unrealistic.  It is a theme that runs through this film.

Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek.

It's difficult to hold the interest of an audience for almost three hours, especially in an age where people can't go five minutes without checking their text messages or tweeting about what's happening in a movie. Heat was made in 1995 when it was much easier to forget the outside world for three hours, and that's part of its strength.

The most obvious thing to mention is that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear on screen together for the first time, and it's the first time they two have appeared in the same film since The Godfather: Part II. Both actors are close to their best and their two meetings are memorable.

Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) works for the LAPD. His job is his passion and he places it above personal relationships. He's on his third marriage and that is failing because he only gives his wife a fraction of his attention if he's home at all. Neil McCauley (De Niro) also has a passion, but he's on the wrong side of the law. He heads a group of thieves who are professional and extremely effective. Unlike Hanna, McCauley doesn't want any personal ties preventing him from being the best he can be.

McCauley has a favorite quote:

""Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner.""

The movie shows us how effective McCauley's crew is when they rob an armored truck early in the movie. One of the crew, Waingro (Kevin Gage), is a loose cannon. His behavior leads to three unnecessary deaths so McCauley decides to kill him. Unfortunately, a passing patrol car distracts McCauley and allows Waingro to escape. He's a constant source of trouble for the remainder of the story.

McCauley's life changes when he meets Eady (Amy Brenneman). Instead of being a free agent, he's in danger of becoming tied down to a relationship. Will he abandon the idea that he can walk away from any situation in 30 seconds, or will she complicate things?

What sets Heat apart is the strong characterization. Mann takes his time establishing all of the characters, even if they have minor roles. As a result, we feel as if we know these people. McCauley's strengths and efficiency are obvious and we learn the roles and abilities of the other crew members. Mann doesn't stop there. We see one crew member, Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer), interacting with his wife (Ashley Judd). Chris has a gambling problem and it's affecting his marriage. His wife questions whether they should even be together. This type of depth is present throughout the movie.

Because we know the characters, it matters when something happens to them. Hanna's life is his job and he's essentially a hunter. McCauley is his current prey and we see Hanna using every available tool to find out what McCauley's crew is planning. As he learns more about McCauley, Hanna finds that he respects the man. They are similar in many ways and both are intelligent.

The most notable scene in the movie happens after Hanna pulls over McCauley in his car. He's not there to arrest him, but simply asks if they can have coffee together. The scene shows the personalities of both men and it's brilliantly written. Hanna mentions that it's his job to stop McCauley and that it's nothing personal. McCauley replies with a warning that he would have to take Hanna out if he got in his way. These are not threats, but calmly-stated facts. The scene is based on a real exchange between McCauley and Chicago cop, Chuck Adamson. If you think the scene is unrealistic, it really happened.

Heat is a drama more than anything else, but the brief action scenes are intense. The actors received training to make their shootouts appear authentic. Mann's focus on such details makes the whole story feel real. When we see people working at a crime scene, many are real forensic experts.

I can't promise 170 minutes of thrills, but the final scenes are among the most intense I've seen portrayed within the genre. All of the acting is good, but Pacino and De Niro understandably dominate things. If you enjoy character-driven stories, Heat is well worth your time.",1334707200,,4128,4.710124826629681

* In depth heists.  Nothing is held back.
* Robert De Niro was born for this role.",1329523200,,405,3.9875

3172464,5,B0017HRJ04,"I might of made a bold statement with my title but I fully stand by it and will defends it's position.
I have revisited this film multiple times and in different age brackets as well. As I get older though, I can't help but to extol this film more and more. It is not so often that a film can offer a stellar cast, a satisfying plot, powerful acting, realistic character interactions, and excellent cinematography.

Michael Mann's Heat which went unnoticed somewhat in 1995 has finally garnered enough attention to warrant an anniversary edition (15th) which will be heading into it's 20th year shortly. (hard to believe) At any rate, this film is proving time and time again why it's receieving the attention it finally deserves.

Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the homocide division of the LAPD and confronts the work of a highly skilled and methodical antagonist, Neil McCauley, (Robert De Niro) after a armored truck heist. Like Neil, Vincent is a master of his craft; dedicated, committed, passionate and just downright professional. It borderlines the point of obsession, or as wife succinctly puts it, ""It is the only thing he is committed to doing."" The only problem for Vincent is managing this demanding career and at the sametime reconciling the needs of his father/husband role at home. His emotionally disturbed step daughter, Lauren, (Natalie Portman) is quite the handful. Her emotional outbursts and not to mention a half way successful attempt at suicide is troubling indeed. Vincent's 3rd wife, Justine (Diane Venora) painstakingly and miserably fails to have her husband, and previous husband participate in Lauren's life.

Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a lone wolf; introverted, organized and very professional. He is a dedicated criminal and trusts his fellow crew members: Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) Nate (Jon Voight) Michael Cherrito (Tom Seizmore) Trejo (Danny Trejo) Waingro (Kevin Gage). During an armored heist, Waingro (a new crew member) is informed by Neil not to kill any of the guards in the truck as this is already established with the other crew members. Unfortunately, Waingro cannot handle the heat (No pun intended) during the operation and intentionally kills one of the guards before leaving the scene. Although the robbery is a success, an unnceccesary dead man is left behind for Vincent to start analyzing and fitting in the pieces of evidence.

At a local diner, Neil and the crew know what must be done in terms of punishment for Waingro's misconduct during the heist. During their departure from the diner, Neil attempts to kill Waingro in the parking lot but is abruptly delayed from a local police officer patrolling nearby. As a result, Waingro escapes undetected but not entirely unscathed either. This sets up the 2nd chase between these two men. Waingro is not only a killer on the loose but a rapist too as we see later in the film.

The chases between these characters are so well choreographed that the three hour run time seems like a 25 minute sit com episode. Michael Mann is successful at making the characters so real in their world. Moreover, he makes their interactions real and invokes such a genuine sense of familiarity with them. He invites you into their crime life, their family life, and their social life. No character in this film is belittled or made to seem less important when acting side by side with the main characters. Michael Mann treats every character with such equality; and, in effect, their emotional impact is significant and powerfully lasting.

For example, Donald Breedan who plays a small role in this film (Dennis Haysbert) is a friend of Neils that just served time and is on parole working as a grill man in a local diner. Although his onscreen time is probably less than five minutes his interactions are so carefully crafted that his subsequent death as Neil's personal driver during a bank heist is quite sad, especially when we see his girlfriend's reaction to his death when shown on the television nightly news. In retrospect, Michael Mann creates realism to his environments. He familiarizes his audience with the characters, the landscape (Streets of LA) and everything in between. Nothing is left unscathed, Michael Mann is professional just like Neil and Vincent are.

Some may not agree with me, but I would be more than happy to defend my statement above because I really haven't seen a film with Al Pacino or Robert De Niro that fulfills these aspects. But enlighten me, I am open to hearing differing opionions.",1327622400,,4528,4.957839262187088

3172474,1,B0017HRJ04,"First, the conclusion:  Don't buy this ersatz ""Blu-Ray"" disc from Warner Bros.  According to almost every technical standard, it stinks.  I should have learned by now that the combination of ""Blu-Ray"" and ""Warner Bros."" means that the video transfer is ""Blu-Ray"" only according to the box label.  That said, this transfer is bad even by Warner Bros pathetic standards.  To make sure my growing prejudice was not interfering with my judgment, I screened the Blu-Ray edition  side by side with the standard DVD version without comment to nine friends and neighbors.  Of nine viewers, five couldn't spot in difference in video quality, two liked the Blu-Ray marginally better, and two liked the regular DVD version better. Though less important than the video quality, the menu options and functionally are awful--cheap, clunky, and almost unbelievably limited.  I've seen better interactive menus on Hong Kong bootleg discs.  Rumors abound that Warner Bros is going to be redoing many of the lousy Blu-Ray selections they've issued in the last few years, but so far there is nothing except rumor.  Market dynamics are supposed to weed out inferior products, but my guess is that many consumers simply don't realize just how inferior some brand offerings are.  So, here's to the informed consumer:  Again, don't waste your money on this low-quality product and show Warner Bros. that we are all a bit smarter than they obviously  think we are.",1321142400,19,1440,5.102564102564102

So pay no attention to negative reviews here- they may have received faulty discs or their equipment is not up to date but I sure don't know what they talking about. THE FILM LOOKS AND SOUNDS BRAND NEW COMPARED TO ALL DVD VERSIONS.

Now, there have been complaints about the cuts in the dialogue between Al Pacino (Vincent) and Diane Venora ( Justine)
 Well, first of all any and all content changes were made by Michael Mann himself and here for once the  creator of the film could go back and improve on the original. And rightly so, for in my view the scenes between Vincent and his annoying wife (including their gratuitous love making) are the weakest part of the movie. Has not it become the cliche-the dedicated cop and his nagging wife/ girlfriend who wants him to stay at home instead of chasing bad guys?  She knew who he was when she married him yet she's acting all surprised when he doesn't show up for dinner on time because of his work!

Maybe the studios think we're daft in the head, that they can churn out Blu-Ray titles that lack true HD picture and we won't notice the difference until they can then issue a remastered version for yet another unit sale.

The rating is for the movie...the dvd gets 3 and the blu-ray 2, if just for also including a good hourlong doc, Mann's commentary, 10 minutes of ok deleted scenes, and a picture that is mildly but not much better than the dvd. If you already love this film and are wondering about the blu-ray, wait for the double dip that you just know is on the way.

That said, this really is a special film. Though not perfect---it's a little too long and has a few too many lingering shots of emotionally wraught faces caught in lovers' quarrels for my taste---those are quibbles, and the strengths far outweigh any flaws.

The acting is the real highlight; both DeNiro and Pacino are at the top of their games here, and their scene together is truly one of the great tete-a-tetes of modern actors that I know of. They're both completely inside their roles in every scene, and Al's over the top moments work every time for me, not easy considering how far over some of them are. Bob's slow burn couldn't be more exact, and those two performances alone make this well worth watching.

But then add in very nice turns from almost everyone else; Voight and Kilmer and Sizemore and Judd are all perfect, and in fact I can't think of one performance here that is less than good to very good. And there's a lot of acting from many folks, so Mann did what he's been able to do in almost no other picture: get solid, natural work from all of his actors.

Mann himself is at his peak here; his best writing by far and also his most convincing direction. Less of the Mann trademark shimmering-lights-at-night vibe (but still plenty, he can't help it and why should he, it works) and more simple shots of good actors doing what they do best. He gets far better performances than usual from everyone here, no doubt due to Al and Bob being on set and making everyone step their games up to their limit; you don't want to suck with these two around you!

The opening and late action/heist scenes are two of the best of the past 20 years for my money, and they contrast so well with the personal, emotional moments throughout the film. I could have taken a few less of those and more of Voight, for instance (who is excellent here), but all in all Heat delivers the goods and is likely to be seen as Mann's peak once all is said and done, followed perhaps by Thief.

But just rent this one for now...a much much better transfer is due to show up soon, and a movie this good deserves no less.",1280016000,2,2475,4.3673913043478265

Purchased the blue ray with high hopes. I saw some improvement in the picture, ok not bad, But what the heck happend to the sound track? Its like watching a Japanese Godzilla movie. Very obvious delay in sound track the mouth moves and a second later the word is heard. The shoot outs are worse, you hear a bang and count to 1 and theres the flash.

And like some people have noticed, there are problems with this.

First I did notice that a few scenes were deleted for some reason.  Can't understand why though.

Also, there is an audio flaw problem, where you have to turn it up the volume on the TV to hear them talk, then turn it down right away when you hear anything else (like a gunshot, explosion, etc.).  This is something similar to the new Star Trek The Original Series release on Blu Ray where the audio has the same problem on a few episodes.

I have a brand new PS3 Slim by the way and yes it does work fine.  I also have ""Blade Runner"" on Blu Ray and it is flawless!  I highly recommend that by the way.  It's perfect.

But this version of heat also had a few scenes that weren't high def.  Very disappointing about that.

3406313,3,B0017HRJ04,"*EDIT 08-Feb-2017*

A short update in order to add some new information now that the remastered version (which premiered at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn theater in Beverly Hills in Sept of last year) has finally made it out on Blu-Ray (currently in Europe, Japan & the UK, although a U.S release should certainly follow shortly). The original review is still left as-is (sans title), as several other aspects pointed out in it still apply to the new release. Please bear this in mind when reading the complete review.

The most obvious change is the new 4K remaster by Stefan Sonnenfeld (of Company 3). And right off the bat - it is quite stunning when compared to the original 2009 Blu-Ray release. Yes, there are scenes (notably the nighttime cityscapes, and a few others) which are still quite soft, so don't expect ""Collateral"" or even ""Miami Vice"" type clarity on those. But obviously those were shot digitally and can't really compare to the 35mm process used to film Mann's masterpiece.

The audio also gets a DTS HD-MA encode (as opposed to the Dolby TrueHD track which was on the 2009 release.) The audio is very similar to the original mix though (although it might sound slightly lower on some receivers which are not applying the same gain as for a Dolby track). The audio bears a strong resemblance to the Japanese DTS HD-MA version - which was basically a re-encode and had the same deficiencies as the TrueHD track during quiet scenes. Some might argue that it sounds 'better', but frankly that IMO comes down to how your receiver handles DTS vs. Dolby material.

It probably comes as no surprise therefore that it is my view that the audio mix would have benefited greatly if only a little attention was given to it in order to improve clarity in the quiter passages of the film, something which could have been accomplished without ruining the overall dynamics of the track. In lack of a more balanced audio transfer, I'd recommend a 2.5dB audio increase in order to more accurately capture the dialogue (while avoiding clipping in the shootout scenes). It is a film that really deserves a forceful impact, so keeping the audio effects slightly subdued does it somewhat of a disservice.

I had slight hopes that the original theatrical release might be provided alongside the director's approved version via seamless branching on this new version, but it appears it won't see the light of day on the format. :-/ Deducting one star for the audio track and the - IMO - superflous cuts made to it. Although certainly not on a level of, e.g, George Lucas' treatment of the Star Wars franchise, it is revisionistic and should be avoided if at all possible. Movies like all other art forms are a point-in-time snapshot and lose quite a bit of their appeal, and charm, when tinkered with long after their initial release.

2009 review follows. If you are considering purchasing this (and unless you feel as strongly about the edits Mann made to it as I do, you should). Ignore the statements relating to the video as they no longer apply.

This release truly was a gargantuan disappointment. ""Heat"" is one of my all-time favorites and Michael Mann one of my favorite directors. I actually did not have huge expectations to this first incarnation of Heat on Blu-Ray--knowing the problems that exist on both the original 1999 DVD release (which I might add was pretty ok at the time, but not by today's standards) and the subsequent 2005 ""Special Edition"" (which had some interesting extras and commentary, but no change to the feature itself.)

But I mean honestly, I am in awe that not only does this disc have basically _the same_ audio track (re-encoded into Dolby TrueHD)--complete with the same muffled audio which for the most part totally lacks any kind of force, and dialogue which in some places is so low it borders on being ridiculous.
I can honestly say that it had no improvement, whatsoever, over the Japanese DTS edition which was released a couple of years back (which also is far from perfect.)

Ok, granted. The audio is not 100%--that I might be able to live with. After all--this is close to being my favorite movie. However, it also has received a *minimal* upgrade on the video side.

No, I am not referring to the inherent film grain. This disc has many scenes which look like they are taken straight off the original DVD and upscaled to 1080p. The lack of detail is most prominent when pausing the movie at certain scenes. Background detail also varies strongly throughout. Yes, it is a Blu-Ray and obviously it will look better than the DVD but I have a quite respectable stack of older movies which completely puts this release in the dust. The bitrate is for the most part around 15-22Mbit/s, peaking at just under 30 in some cases; but seldom reaching this point.

Just to illustrate that minimal care has been given to the video aspect, note that it even has the _exact same_ color-change problem which occurs after Amy Brenneman's character (Eady) hangs up the phone with McCauley / De Niro (at 54:32)

While this is all bad enough, later on I actually notice that some of the dialogue has been *CUT OUT*. (Why haven't other reviewers noticed this?) Specifically where Diane Venora's character (Justine) is talking to Vincent Hanna / Pacino after the office party has ended. From the passage below, the first part (""you sift through the detritus"") has been omitted(!). I actually had to rewind to verify this, as this kind of thing is pretty unusual, and not something I've noticed on any of the previous DVD versions:

""You sift through the detritus, you read the terrain, you search for signs of passing, for the scent of your prey ... and then you hunt them down. That's the only thing you're committed to. The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.""

Just to make it clear--this was not some one-off problem with my disc or equipment causing it to skip ahead at that particular juncture. No drop-outs to the digital audio signal was witnessed either.

To me, cutting out dialogue (especially something as relevant and beautifully phrased) in such a fashion is completely baffling. I don't know what on earth happened to this release while it was mastered on Blu-Ray, but this just topped it all off and prompted me to eject the disc. I could not bear to see what other flaws or edits it might have been subjected to.

I might add that, never once have I not watched this movie to the end. And I have watched it probably 30 times. But this was truly an abysmal experience. Warner, are you listening? You have plenty of other awe-inspiring releases, and some which are decades older than this one which look (and some which sound) a zillion times better--Superman, North by Northwest, The Road Warrior, Bullitt, The Dirty Dozen--to name a few.

After I submit this review I will create a return request for this item. I urge all others who truly love this movie to do the same; and not put up with what is basically a repackaged & cut version of the original DVD.

What a waste of a truly great disc format.",1259020800,637,7224,4.830097087378641
3406314,5,B0017HRJ04,"HEAT became my favorite film after I first saw it on HBO. Although having it on DVD, I recently bought the Bluray version. While not the sharpest transfer in my collection, the 5.1 audio is superb (clear dialogue; the gunfight after the bank job, the helicopter flyby leading to the face-to-face between Neil and Vincent, and the whining and screaming jets at LAX). Overlooking a few flaws (such as Vincent grabbing a shotgun off a uniformed cop at the hotel without identifying himself), HEAT is true to life, and the covert police techniques equally apply to the intelligence game. It is hard to understand why HEAT didn't make a bigger impact when in theater release.",1258329600,7,670,4.834782608695652
3406315,5,B0017HRJ04,"I firmly believe Heat is the best movie ever made. The relatable and genuine characters drive the compelling and well-paced plot. The action is fresh and breathless, and the heralded shootout at the bank heist is amazing in its violence and complexity.

As a writer myself, what I appreciate most in this movie is the sincerity of the characters and the generally understated way they go about their lives. Conversations are stripped of all excess dialogue, but they are so much richer for it. I credit the ensemble nature of the cast for most of this commendable attribute to the movie. Good supporting actors with only a few minutes of screen time, like John Voight and William Fichtner, are engaging and entirely believable. What I think makes their performances effective is that the actors understand they do not support the movie themselves. Therefore, they can pour themselves into a two-minute scene without having to worry about sustaining that kind of effort over the course of a two-hour movie.

There are many more examples of this, but I will provide three.

When the pursued crew meets up to decide whether to rob a bank, Sizemore's character Cheritto is counseled to drop out of the heist because for someone in his situation it's an unnecessary risk. Sizemore's acting in this scene alone merits an Oscar nomination, even though he only delivers three lines. The emotion on his face, though, speaks paragraphs.

In another scene, Dennis Haysbert's character Donald is propositioned to participate in the bank heist at the last minute. He's on parole and is working a crummy job at a diner, and the temptation to return to the action, the money, and the world of crime that he is familiar with is so clear in his expression. What's also clear is the expression he gives to his internal conflict: He knows what he is doing is wrong, but he acts against it on impulse. By and large, these characters have already made their moral choices and are living with the consequences with a calm resignation.

Finally, Val Kilmer's character Chris goes to his wife after the botched heist. But with a simple gesture of her hand, she waves him off, as she is being surveiled by the police. He recognizes the signal and leaves, presumably never seeing her or his son again. In a gesture, his life is completely changed. What's better, it's done entirely without dialogue.",1258070400,8,2373,4.834975369458128
3406316,5,B0017HRJ04,"Was just checking up on the Blu to verify one of my favorite films was given a decent transfer.

The picture quality was solid, grainy in a few of the night interior shots (Ashley Judd's scenes with the trap house & cops shows some actual pores but when out of focus looks very grainy). The famous shoot out sequence looks valid, but the TrueHD seemed a little muted. The best sound test was when Studi's character shotguns the hotel door - that rocked. Overall, the Blu only shows the shortcomings of original filming but the upgrade is worth it (for the first time I noticed all of the cameramen/crew in the window shot when Deniro kills Fichtner's character).

The supplements are all identical to the special edition release. They show 10 subtitled languages and no region coding listed. I am happy with the cut, and it will play nicely for sharing just not the best for sound. 5 for film, clarity and supplements.",1257552000,11,918,4.625766871165644

I love the intelligence factors: the planning, the attention to every possible detail, and near flawless execution by the high stake criminals led by a ruthless, super sophisticated mastermind (who's never going back to prison), vs the experienced, catch-the-bad-guys-at-all-cost, hardcore, smart cop Pacino who knows every chess move (and never sleeps). It's like a Titan against a Titan. The bank robbery scene is by far the best shoot-out ever filmed imo. Plus an all-star cast featuring Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Val Kilmer (fantastic rifle skills-one of his best movies), Danny Trejo (who played himself oddly enough :), John Voight (shifty-eyed bag man), and Kevin Gage (the creep who played Waingro) ""Look at me!!!""

3406363,5,B0017HRJ04,"HEAT [1995 / 2017] [Directors Definitive Edition] [2 Blu-ray Discs] Michael Mann Made His Coolest Film Ever! Michael Mann Shows Two Hollywood Heavyweights Burns As Brightly As Ever!

Oscar winners Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both drive one of the most powerful and complex crime dramas of all time and four-time Oscar nominees Michael Mann's classic HEAT [1995], and arriving in an all-new Director's Definitive Edition from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

In the wake of a precision heist of an armoured van, the crew of a fierce, professional thief [Robert De Niro] and an obsessively driven LAPD detective [Al Pacino] are locked in deadly opposition as they vector towards each other in Mann's dazzling, twilight vision of Los Angeles. As the stakes escalate and their lives begin to unravel, the crew initiates its most dangerous and complex heist.

Taking inspiration from the late Chicago police detective Chuck Adamson, who killed the actual Neil McCauley in a shootout in 1963. HEAT was the culmination of years of research by Michael Mann, resulting in its depth and range of characters and choreography of action. With its epic scale and stunning performances from Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman and Jon Voight. HEAT is as incendiary as it was 20 years ago. HEAT sizzles with hard-hitting action and gripping suspense! The Blu-ray release has been sourced from a NEW 4K Re-mastered negative of the film, supervised by director Michael Mann.

FILM FACT: To make the long shootout more realistic they hired British ex-Special Air Service Special Forces sergeant Andy McNab as a technical weapons trainer and adviser. Andy McNab designed a weapons training curriculum to train the actors for three months using live ammunition before shooting with blanks for the actual take and worked with training them for the bank robbery. Principal photography for HEAT lasted 107 days. All of the shooting was done on location, Michael Mann deciding not to use a soundstage.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: HEAT [1995] is perhaps the ultimate guy bonding type film. Directed by Michael Mann, the film tells the story of two not-so-very-different men. One, an LAPD homicide detective named Lt. Vincent Hanna [Al Pacino], is so consumed by his work that he is failing his third marriage and prowls the streets of Los Angeles like a wolf, stalking those who would do wrong, while his personal life falls into ruin. The other, a professional criminal named Neil McCauley [Robert De Niro] who is simply doing what he knows best, armed robbery and he also lives a lonely existence, making no personal connections that he couldn't walk out on at a moments notice. Neil McCauley and his crew are after one last score a bank heist that could land them more than $12 million. As these two hardened pros go about their business, they gradually become aware of one another predator and prey and each begins to gain a certain respect for the other. But both also know that they're on a collision course: In the end, only one will be left standing.

There are the questions posed by Heat, which uses the predator-versus-prey narrative of expert thief Neil McCauley [Robert De Niro] outrunning dogged Lt. Vincent Hanna [Al Pacino] to explore these remarkably similar archetypes of lone wolf masculinity. Neil McCauley is introspective, self-contained in his alone but not lonely universe, a career criminal with a talent for big money scores. He has an allegiance and understanding with his crew, but no room in his life for any lasting connection. As he says repeatedly, he refuses attachment to anything hes unwilling to walk out on if he feels the heat around the corner.

Vincent Hanna, on the other hand, is explosive and spontaneous. His interrogation of a suspect involves him bursting into song, then musing whether the suspect fell in love last night, then shrieking, Gimme all you got! Gimme all you got! Hes hungry for the chase and working all hours of day and night while his third wife Justine [Diane Venora] passes him on the downward slope of a marriage. Robert De Niro may have the better role, a tragic protagonist whose moral values get pushed to their limit, whereas Al Pacino gets all the best dialogue. But these characters don't know how to do anything else, and don't much want to either. Its a sentiment that lies in the tradition of American individualists. Theres something comforting about applying knowledge to the point where it becomes instinct, and if these guys weren't cops or robbers we could admire them the way we admire the mechanic who fixes our car when its broken down. As Lt. Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley prove time and again, unless you happen to be working with them and speaking their language.

Michael Mann's masterpiece is a 170 minutes crime epic, a love/hate  letter the city of Los Angeles, a scathing Balzacian and literary adjective view of a society corrupt from top to bottom, and a vision of the universe as a space contested over by the fractious armies of crime and the law. Opening with a spectacular armoured-car robbery that degenerates into mass murder, and the film HEAT follows the consequences of the raid, the plans for its successor, the response of the police, led by detective Vincent Hanna and the consequences of it all for wives, families, girlfriends and innocent bystanders.

The cops and the crooks are both constituted like armies, with generals, ranks and special skills assigned and doppelgangers in the opposing team. Michael Mann is less interested in moral questions than in professionalism as a code worth adhering to, no matter which side of the law one finds oneself on. Michael Mann's equal sympathies for both sides are always evident and say he also loves Los Angeles at night, and rarely has it been evoked as beautifully as it is here, as does the film respect the same genre scenario to great effect.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Foxs new Blu-ray disc gives us the ultimate and brilliant 1080p image presentation and especially combined with a spectacular 2.39:1 aspect ratio, and has been remastered from a brand new 4K scan and restoration supervised by Michael Mann himself, and definitely improves over the upon Warner Bros. 2009 Blu-ray image in virtually every bit as good. Something that is obvious right from the start is that the colour timing is much improved and is much more richly saturated now and much more natural also, yet still have that just slightly desaturated look that is true to this films image quality. The night sky and shadows are more truly black in some scenes now. Overall image detail exhibits greater refinement, crisp yet clean looking even given the occasional optical softness and the film was shot with anamorphic lenses, and the grain texture is more subtle and refined. This is a very film-like image, with not a hint of digital filtering. Id love to see how an actual 4K Ultra HD release could improve upon this and its too bad there isn't one. Nevertheless, this is a significant step up visual upgrade.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Foxs new Blu-ray disc, previously offered us a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD mix, but this new edition has instead presented us with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentations. The new mix retains the smooth and natural staging of the previous mix, which turns very lively and dramatic in the action and atmospheric scenes, and adds a bit more oomph and sounds much fuller and even more engrossing, which gives the dramatic staging a bit more ambience sound experience. But when it comes to the dialogue scenes when they talk face to face, slightly annoyed me as they talked so quiet I had to crank the sound up a great deal. But when it comes to the surround sound activity it is very satisfying, with a nice mix, and very good all round speaker activity, especially near the end of the film when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have the cat and mouse shoot out at the airport was totally awesome when the planes come into land, all the speakers are in full swing and you feel the planes are landing in your lounge, it is that realistic and the result is a highly immersive audio presentation and definitely gets a five star rating.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by director Michael Mann: Here Michael man goes straight into talking about the film, and informs us about the first scene we view, which was the Blue line of the Los Angeles MTA [Los Angeles Metro Rail system] and was not open to the public when they shot that scene, and what we witness is actually the end of the line and it was shot two weeks before the official opening of the line. Michael Mann also says that when we start to see the main characters, we get to see an interacting of each character as the film builds up and of course how eventually we see how it all comes together by the end of the film. When we start to see all the criminals coming together at the start of the film, Michael explains that it is all based on real life criminals and their activities. When we first see Jon Voight, Michael mentions why he is called Nate, which relates to a character in the film THIEF who was called Nate Grossman and the character of Sam Grossman was based on Nathan Grossman, the grandfather of a friend of Michael Mann, and is homage to someone who passed away a very long time ago. Michael Mann goes into great detail about all the main characters we get to view as the film progresses and also mentions that his daughter got to interview all the real wives of the criminals that have been portrayed in this film and again Michael Mann slowly reveals a much more in-depth histrionics towards all the main characters in the film to make them sound more realistic, even though they are portraying the real people who the film is based on. Michael also goes into great detail about the scene with local police informer and Michael says they never in real life tell the truth, and the scene with Al Pacino being very intimidating, does it to throw the police informer off balance, so it keeps them in check and hopefully will not have the police come back to interrogate them again, to take the heat off. When you see Al Pacino in the helicopter flying over nigh time in Los Angeles seeking out Robert De Niro on the highway, well Michael Mann states that shots of all the lights looks beautiful, well with one shot of inside the helicopter you see a small TV screen Al Pacino is looking at, well Michael informs us that this technology was perfected for the Vietnam War and is called a FLIR and means Forward Looking Infrared cameras for night time viewing and is typically used on military and civilian aircraft, use a thermographic camera that senses infrared radiation. I personally found Michael Manns audio commentary slightly monotonous and boring, especially half way through the film and near the end of the film with the final shootout with Al Pacino and Robert Di Nero where Michael Mann just states the obvious what we are viewing, in thinking we cannot work out for ourselves what is going on in certain scenes we are viewing. I just wish Michael Mann would stop talking for a while and gather his thoughts and speak again when something more interesting appears in the film that he can divulge some more interesting information about the film and the reason he shot a particular scene or the concept of what his audiences wanted to view. Personally I would have to only give a two star rating for this Michael Mann audio commentary.

Special Feature: Filmmaker Panels: Here we get to view two very interesting individual special features and they are as follows:

01. 2016 Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences Panel [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [63:00] The Academys Samuel Goldwyn Theater was rocked with the sounds of applause and high-octane action on 7th September, 2016 when the cast and crew of the epic crime film HEAT were reunited for a look at the making of this Los Angeles film milestone and they had just all viewed the film HEAT and thirteen people are welcomed onto the stage who were all involved with the film and is moderated by Christopher Nolan [Director] who was greeted by a very enthusiastic sold-out crowd. I have no idea why they invited Robert De Niro, as he is the most boring person in the world and most the time he just sits there looking like he wished he had not been invited as he is useless. Unfortunately Val Kilmer had an infected swollen tongue and he had a terrible job trying to speak or to be understood and he sounded like the cartoon character Donald Duck. All in all this was a fascinating watch and very informative, especially from the guests on the stage, but sadly out of the twelve guests on the stage, sadly there were one or two of them did not get asked any questions, which is a shame. But despite this, it was a really interesting and fascinating session. Contributors include: Al Pacino [Actor], Robert De Niro [Actor], Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Amy Brenneman [Actress], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], William Goldenberg [Editor], Val Kilmer [Actor], Art Linson [Producer], Andy Nelson [Re-recording Mixer], Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer], Diane Venora [Actress] and Mykelti Williamson [Actor].

02. 2015 Toronto International Film Festival [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [30:27]. One of the most ground-breaking crime dramas of its time, the film HEAT celebrated its 20th anniversary at the Toronto International Film Festival with a screening of the film in a new 35mm print followed by a Q&A session with the director Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], and was moderated by Jesse Wente. Michael Mann talks about how the film came about, which related to a real life crime incident in 1963 via one of Michael Manns friend Chuck Adamson [Former Chicago Police Officer] about the story of the notorious Neil McCauley criminal. In 1963, detective Chuck Adamson sat down in a Chicago coffee shop with a convicted bank robber. Rail thin and with careworn features, career criminal Neil McCauley had spent some 25 of his 49 years in and out of prison for a string of crimes ranging from theft to murder. But in spite of his repeated brushes with the law, Neil McCauley had no intention of going straight and with meeting with Michael Mann and Chuck Adamson, started the ball rolling that helped to bring us the awesome film HEAT. Although this special feature is just over 30 minutes, it sure packs a lot fascinating information about the making of the film and interesting anecdotes from Michael Mann and is well worth viewing.

Special Feature: The Making of HEAT [2005] [1080i] [1.37:1] [59:12] Here we have the original documentary which is from the original inferior DVD, and it is split into three separate small documentaries on their own merit and they are TRUE CRIME; CRIME STORIES and INTO THE FIRE. A lot of ground is covered in this thorough and fascinating documentary about the making of the film HEAT. The origin and fruition of the story and film is explained in great detail, as well as the overall love shared for this project by everyone involved through the many interviews with cast and crew members and we also get to view a plethora of film clips from the film HEAT. I really enjoy these kinds of making-of features, so this was right up my alley. Contributors include: Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Chuck Adamson [Former Chicago Police Officer], Richard Lindberg [Author/Chicago Historian], Dennis Farina [Actor/Former Chicago Police Officer], Al Pacino [Actor/Vincent Hanna], Tom Elfmont [Technical Advisor/L.A.P.D.], Rey Verdugo [Technical Advisor/L.A. Sheriffs Dept.], Jon Voight [Actor/Nate], Robert De Niro [Actor/Neil McCauley] (archive footage), Val Kilmer [Actor/Chris Shiherlis], Edward Bunker [Author: No Beast So Fierce], Dennis Haysbert [Actor/Breedan], Tom Sizemore [Actor/Michael Cheritto], Michael Waxman [First Assistant Director], Art Linson [Producer], Amy Brenneman [Actress/Eady], Mykelti Williamson [Actor/Drucker], Ami Canaan Mann [Second Unit Director], Bonnie Timmermann [Casting Director], Tom Noonan [Actor/Kelso], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer], Ashley Judd [Actress/Charlene Shiherlis], Diane Venora [Actress/Justine Hanna], Tom Elfmont [Technical Advisor/L.A.P.D.], Andy McNab [Technical Weapons Trainer], Danny Trejo [Actor/Trejo], Michael ""Mick"" Gould [Technical Weapons Trainer], Neil Spisak [Film Production Designer], Chris Jenkins [Sound Mixer Engineer], Elliot Goldenthal [American Composer] and Moby [American Musician].

Special Feature: Pacino and De Niro: The Conversation [2005] [1080i] [1.37:1] [9:59] Here we take a closer look at the diner scene that features the two leading male actors. The ghastly pan-and-scan released version of the film HEAT that was originally released on VHS back in the 1990s led some people to think the actors were filmed separately and did not appear together onscreen in this restaurant scene, but thankfully those days of visually butchered films are long gone and this time Michael Mann explains how they filmed that very intense scene and both actors their performance without a rehearsal, as they felt it would be much more natural performance and it is definitely a tour de force performance. Contributors include: Jon Voight [Actor/Nate], Pieter Jan Brugge [Dutch Film Producer], Michael Mann [Writer/Director/Producer], Robert De Niro [Actor/Neil McCauley] (archive footage), Art Linson [Producer], James Wolcott [American Film Critic/Journalist], Al Pacino [Actor/Vincent Hanna], Ashley Judd [Actress/Charlene Shiherlis], Tom Sizemore [Actor/Michael Cheritto] and Dante Spinotti, A.I.C. [Italian Cinematographer].

Special Feature: HEAT: Return to the Scene of the Crime [2005] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:05] Here we take a visit to the Los Angeles locations used in the film HEAT. Location manager Janice Polley and associate producer Gusmano Cesaretti helm this absorbing feature in which they discuss the photography and locales that Michael Mann utilised in the film. The pair gushes over Michael Mann's talent, but they also touch on plenty of topics that aren't explored elsewhere on this Blu-ray disc. What was interesting is that they go back to certain locations that were pivotal to the film and why they were used, which got the green light from Michael Mann and with each location we get clips from the film that relates to the modern day locations, but of course a lot of the locations in Los Angeles have changed dramatically since 1995. One aspect of a certain location that I found interesting, where they filmed the final showdown shoot out at the airport, which had to be filmed at midnight and they say what they did could not be filmed today, as there are too many safety issues, especially where Robert De Niro had to run in front of a Jumbo jet that had just landed. Contributors include: Janice Polley [Location Manager/Scout], Gusmano Cesaretti [Associate Producer], Jayne Mazzochi [Resident] and Lisa Glucksmann [Restaurant Worker].

Special Feature: Additional Footage: Deleted Scenes [2005] [480p] [1.37:1] [9:44] Here we get to view a total of 11 deleted scenes, and they are as follows: SCENE 5: SEASONS STARTING EARLY; SCENE 42: NICEST GUY ON THE BLOCK; SCENE 55: ALBERT AND HANNA [ALTERNATE TAKE]; SCENE 62: SHAKEDOWN; SCENE 76: MURDER IN C-BLOCK; SCENE 96A: LETS DAMCE; SCENE 125: LATE ARIVAL; SCENE 148/147: WHERES ANNA; SCENE 177B: DOUBLE THE WORST TROUBLE; SCENE 191: NATE DELIVERS and SCENE 204A: NO RESPONSE. When viewed in the context of the finished product, they offer a nice lesson into how editing shapes a film of this calibre and how little things can have a big impact. Note that the temporary music was used, so they don't reflect the final score for those scenes, had they been included. As usual, you can either watch each one individually or Play All.

Theatrical Trailers [2005 [1080i] [1.37:1] [6:48] Here you get to view three excellent and dramatic Original Theatrical Trailers, that were entitled as follows: SURPRISE OF A LIFETIME; TWO ACTORS COLLIDE and CLOSING IN. As usual, you can either watch each trailer separately or Play All.

Finally, if you haven't picked up HEAT before, or you feel you want to upgrade your inferior DVD, this is a totally worthwhile purchase, especially since you can find it very cheap now in lots of outlets. Ive said it before and it bears repeating: Heat is just a great film that I cant speak of more highly. I wish this new edition was available in 4K Ultra HD, but even so the restoration is impressive and the hour of added bonus content is a nice treat. If youve never seen Heat before, this is absolutely the version you want to buy on Blu-ray. If you're already a fan and you have the previous edition, my advice is to sell it and upgrade immediately, as it is even more worthwhile upgrading this brilliant action packed film, even for those who have the earlier Blu-ray release. Very Highly Recommended!

3406386,5,B0017HRJ04,"Billed as ""A Los Angeles Crime Saga,"" ""Heat"" is one of the finest crime dramas ever to come out of Hollywood. Now newly reissued in a Directors Cut edition on Blu-ray, this the story of Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), two charismatic men on opposite sides of the law. With its two superstar co-lead actors (Pacino and De Niro), and an equally outstanding supporting cast that includes Diane Venora, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, and Val Kilmer, this movie provides nearly three hours of spine-tingling suspense and superb action.

""Heat"" abounds with fantastic action scenes, culminating in a bank heist and shootout between Neil McCauley's gang of bank robbers and Vincent Hanna's squad of police detectives. In the immediate aftermath of the heist are found the best action sequences in the entire film. I think they rank among the best action scenes in any movie of recent years. The battle between McCauleys automatic weapons-wielding crew and dozens of Hannas equally well-armed police officers, fought over several city blocks, takes on the grim, fiery reality of urban combat. This scene is grand in its scope, perfectly executed, and positively gripping to watch.

The acting in ""Heat"" is uniformly superb. as one might expect with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro leading the cast. Each of these actors plays his part to perfection  Pacino, angst-ridden, hard-as-nails, slightly burned out, yet totally dedicated to stopping and apprehending Neil McCauley and his gang; and De Niro, coldly calculating, soft spoken, betraying no outward hint of his violent nature, a man alone in the world

Perhaps the most interesting scene in ""Heat"" occurs when Vince Hanna and Neil McCauley sit down in a caf for a cup of coffee. This scene, rated by ""TV Guide"" as one of the 50 best movie scenes of all time, was the first time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro had ever acted together in the same scene. It is simply a marvelous display of acting by two of the best actors of their generation...

""Heat"" is one of my all-time favorite movies of any genre. Most highly recommended.",1505347200,5,2101,4.923728813559322

A few story lines and then BAM they all collide towards the end of the movie.  Lots of action and Michael Mann is still the best on night scenes.  He just knows how to shoot them.

Great soundtrack. Great acting by everyone. DeNiro and Pacino at their macho best. Kilmer's best.  Sizemore back when he cared. Mann is all about atmosphere and pacing, and here he has a fantastic script as well, so it all just clicks. Why this didn't win more awards is beyond me. Sometimes movies beat out the Oscar winners by becoming classics in their own right. This is one of them.

But to see it again on the big screen with a packed, I mean PACKED, theater was worth the two hour wait in line. I will definitely scoop this blu ray up.

  this movie, although it may be old, is one of the best made movies, ever.  the characters were outstanding with definite quirks and history.  but, it is so amazing that these actors were so young compared to now. aren't we all...after 22 years.  but, it is fun to watch corded phones in cars, wall phones and clothes that are quirky to say the least.  the actors? what great portrayal of the good, bad and awful.  this movie made everyone think about truth, honesty, and loyalty to the nth degree.  the top two actors were excellent as usual and the supporting cast made this movie wonderful.  one wonders if this movie was the precursor to the north hollywood shoot out back in the late 90's.  a great movie and can be watched many times over... also almost a 3 hour movie...whew! but, an excellent one at that...",1492214400,5,823,4.537414965986395

The way Mann conveys the mood and feeling just grabs me. The lighting, locations, and most important the cast. If De Niro had played next to anyone else than Pacino he would have smothered him and same goes for Pacino. The soundtrack of this movie is amazing, it really helps bring you in and assists the conveyance of mood. The character development makes you feel for each side, and makes me feel that I've known McCauley and Hanna for some time. I think most of us have feelings from both sides of this movie. I think that's why I'm so drawn to this movie.

You see flashes of the incipient lunatic emerge in one or two scenes (""She has a GREAT ASS!!!!"") but he's still capable of a subtlety that he would abandon shortly thereafter. Similarly with Deniro, he hasn't yet descended into the ""I'll take any role for a paycheck"" mindset that would come upon him soon afterwards. Heat is among my favorite movies because it doesn't overreach. An odd thing to say about a movie with a nearly 3 hour runtime, but Michael Mann knows what he's doing and the story has little enough fat. There are elements, indeed some whole storylines, that aren't strictly necessary to tell the cops-and-robbers tale that is the movie's kernel, but these flesh out the film in a way that feels organic. For a movie that's better than 2 decades old, Heat still feels rather fresh because it is essentially a character study in the framework of a shoot 'em up.",1459209600,2,950,4.660714285714286

3406607,5,B0017HRJ04,"This film is exceptional. Almost all crime films are biased in their portrayal of cops vs robbers. If the cop is the main character, the criminals are snatching babies or just generally being evil and *incompetent*. If the bad guys are the main characters, it's a horror movie. Finally, this is a movie where both sides are experts and they're both like-able. As such, I never knew which way the film was going to end.

Both sides have just as much likelihood to win in the end and I could realistically get behind either side. This film kept me on the edge and seemed so much more realistic about the criminals. They weren't just bad guys for the sake of it. They didn't have the clichs of having ""henchmen"" and having a taste for fine art. This movie is absolutely compelling; it still gives me goosebumps just seeing the trailer.",1447459200,,832,4.546666666666667

A masterpiece in noir and intricate storytelling, Michael Mann and his crew prove why the vibe they conveyed in Miami Vice still holds a lot of sway over American culture to this day.

Oh, did I mention Pacino and DeNiro deliver? Need you any other reason besides the presence of two masters in method acting in opposing roles? LA never looked so foreboding and the cinematography of the night shots is more reminiscent of a rock and roll video from the old days than it is of reality. Incredibly well done.

3406700,3,B0017HRJ04,"Shocked..... Just shocked.... I couldn't believe how mediocre of a film this was. With such an A list cast this movie easily underperforms and was, frankly, a pretty dull and mildly painful watching experience.

So this was Al Pacino vs. Robert De Niro in a nutshell. And thanks to some lackluster writing and, honestly, some lackluster acting this movie just didn't work for me. Yes, I am seeing this 20 years after the fact and times have most certainly changed, but this film was quite average. The gun fight scenes were near ridiculous with implausible escapes and middling tension. Although the tension issue was due mostly to the poor foreshadowing. It was almost like they were telling you what was going to happen. If someone was trying to start a new life, dead. Told to get out of the business, dead! It was really rather upsetting as I've heard so many great things about this movie.

OK, so the acting... I've got to start out by saying that Scarface was and still is one of my favorite movies, but Pacino just showed up for a paycheck in this one. I can't be sure whether it was the writing or he just didn't care, but man, the lines were bad. He had some gems in this one, ""Show me what ya got"", ""when I see a woman's ass, something comes out of me""! And these are real lines and he's screaming each and every one of them.... De Niro was better, but he couldn't Atlas this movie on his shoulders.

I've heard that the script was actually held on a shelf for around 10 years before this movie was made. I'm thinking it should have stayed a little longer. Some random scenes helped fill out the extra hour (yes it's a 3 hour movie). Pacino is dealing with woman trouble due to his work dedication and struggles to synch with his rebellious teen stepdaughter. De Niro is the criminal looking for love, but doesn't want to roll the dice because of his crook ways. Blah, blah, blah... Seriously though, here are some scenes. Because they are both super intelligent in there respective areas, they literally jump between cutscenes almost finishing each others sentences. De Niro decides he needs to get a new passport because the heat is on, next scene, Pacino says to look for De Niro to get a new passport. Pacino figures out he's been ""made"" the second before De Niro snaps a picture of him. It truly goes on and on with those equally smart shots....

*Sigh*, just upsetting.... I really wanted to enjoy this one. I might be a little harsh here, but I don't think I am. It's worth a watch, but this one has been overhyped and doesn't deserve the high 4 1/2 star rating it currently has. If people went back and rewatched this one, I would hope they'd come to the same conclusion I have. This movie is middle of the road.",1425686400,,2731,4.466933867735471
3406701,5,B0017HRJ04,"I don't know why this movie doesn't get brought up more often when people talk about the great roles from Pacino and De Niro, but maybe that speaks more to the level of films they've been involved with in the past than this particular film.

The plot was complex enough that you can't write this off as just another mindless action movie, but simple enough that you don't have pay attention to the smallest detail. Basically, you get out of this film what you put into it. Loved it, and would definitely watch again.",1425600000,,516,4.48936170212766

3406740,5,B0017HRJ04,"A great Robert De Niro and Al Pacino collaboration!!!!This is what the film,Heat,a written and directed by Michael Mann,is all about.

De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional thief, while Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, veteran LAPD homicide detective tracking down McCauley's crew. The central conflict was based on the experiences of former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson and his pursuit in the 1960s of a criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. Aside from De Niro and Pacino,the film also has an all-star ensemble that includes Val Kilmer, Jon Voight,Tom Sizemore,Diane Venora,Amy Brenneman,Ashley Judd and a young Natalie Portman - that makes the performances of this film first class.

It is more than just a story of a police and criminal playing the cat- and-mouse game. The tension and conflict provided by the story definitely is far from contrived as it is honest and totally realistic. Aside from the good performances,credit also should be given to Mann.

Heat is just more than an action film. It is simply one of the best crime thrillers ever made in Hollywood. It is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's if not the best.",1418774400,2,1179,4.974619289340102

I've learned to appreciate Michael Mann. I've become less critical at this point. I don't need to see shootings and gun play all the time in a crime movie. Character development and small character moments are excellent.

Upon re-watching this movie, I do find that I appreciate the moments that I appreciated the first time. Michael Mann loves Los Angeles and loves filming Los Angeles in the night when it's particularly spooky. The scene between DeNiro and Al Pacino is a landmark in film history (and cannot be exceeded by the movie where they were together in almost every scene). There are even some genuinely fascinating moments like Hank Azaria doing a Quentin Tarantino impression and cameos by Henry Rollins and Dany Trejo.

But overall, this movie is way too long. It seems to be leading up to a bank heist but then that's over and there's still an hour left to go. By that point, it just seems like everyone stops dead in their tracks in order to drag out the narrative even longer.

I know people love this movie and I can see some of the appeal, but there's a lot of moodiness without much payoff over all.",1408838400,,1264,4.584070796460177

No stene-stealing or other disappointing conduct. Supporting actors Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore craft characters you think about long after you've forgotten the movie's storyline.

3406791,2,B0017HRJ04,"Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) is a clear example of style over substance. While visually appealing and atmospheric (it's Mann we're talking about!), I feel that this film lacks true depth and goes nowhere. ""Heat"" is an epic crime drama that stars acting legends Al Pacino (as good guy cop Lt. Vincent Hanna) and Robert DeNiro (as bad guy expert thief Neil McCauley), but I feel that much of this film's acclaim is simply based on the weight of their resumes and not on the actual content that both actors contribute to the film. Pacino plays his role WAY over the top, while DeNiro UNDERPLAYS his role too much. 2 performances at opposite (and monotonous) ends of the acting spectrum. After the 2 main stars, there is a varying degree of poor to good performances scattered about.

Examples of The GOOD? The actors playing Vincent's subordinates: Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi , and Ted Levine were very good. These actors really seemed like cops and watching them operate looked very realistic. But, sadly, they were overshadowed by Pacino's histrionics. Additionally, a teen-aged Natalie Portman is a scene-stealer as Hanna's troubled stepdaughter, as is Kevin Gage as Waingro, a psychopathic member of Neil's team. And of course the film is beautiful to look at it, with the typical Mann cinematic flourishes of bright colors and scenic views of Los Angeles.

Examples of the POOR? The members of Neil's team, played by Val Kilmer (Shiherlis), Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo, were all interchangeable characters. The cops being straight-laced make total sense, but the criminals' were much too methodical to be believed as bad guys, especially given some of the horrific crimes they were committing. Also poorly characterized were most of the main female characters! Diane Venora (as Vincent's wife), Amy Brenneman (as Neil's girlfriend), and Ashley Judd (as Shiherlis' wife) were very one-note and hard to gauge. They all seemed like the same character. In reality, Mann populated this film with a bunch of actors just to add to it's epic appeal without giving most of them any real depth. And the ones I just mentioned aren't even HALF of the cast given significant screen time! There are literally about a dozen or so more actors thrown in the mix, all incredibly one-dimensional and non-descript. I also have a major nitpick with the final music used at the ending credits, because it is a complete ripoff of the score to the movie ""Starman"" from 1984. Not an original score!

The plot of ""Heat"" is very by-the-numbers with McCauley's gang getting away with crime after crime, while the LAPD trudges through the entire film with their tails between their legs, basically waiting for a BIG crime to be committed, while innocent people get caught in the crossfire along the way. The movie has too many preachy, speechifying moments where ALL characters have cathartic moments, when in reality, it would be more likely that perhaps 1 or 2 would have such moments. The big Pacino-DeNiro scene at the midway point is absolutely nothing to write home about! They've both done MUCH better work, even in some of their lesser-known efforts in their careers. Clocking in at almost THREE hours, ""Heat"" is a very depressing tale despite the vividness of it's appearance. The ending, in my opinion, is far from satisfying, with some very questionable moments.

I believe that Mann did a much greater job with films in the crime genre like ""Collateral"" (my personal favorite film of his, and in my opinion, his best film) and ""Manhunter"" (another classic) where the films were visually stunning, stylish, BUT ALSO superbly scripted and acted. Those films leave a lasting impression. ""Heat"" not so much!",1405468800,2,3691,4.987012987012987

3406794,5,B0017HRJ04,"There is so much depth to Heat, which is part of the reason the movie is almost 3 hours long. The film's director, Michael Mann, clearly took his time filming this movie to get the best performances from his actors, which resulted in one of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best ever. In my mind Heat is the best heist movie ever made, but moreover it is one of the best crime dramas ever made. It is an incredibly deep film that was profoundly thorough in it's character development.

For each of the major characters in the film we were introduced to their personal lives, learning more about them. This made us care that much more about these characters and eventually what would happen to them.

3406796,3,B0017HRJ04,"Heat is not above criticism. I've put off reviewing this film for a long time as I know any negative comments will provoke an angry response from people who are blind to any faults. It's a good film, but it is far from perfect.

Pacino and DeNiro are cop and crook who go head-to-head over a major heist. They have many similarities, and could otherwise have been friends, only they are on opposite sides of the same coin - both cerebral, cunning, and crafty. Attempts at juxtaposing their lives come across as a little indulgent, but it's a crime epic, with lots of characters and cameos, so the running time has to be filled-up with something.

I just wish the dialogue wasn't so clipped and the editing so inconsistent. The movie has a naturalistic feel, meaning a lot words sound mumbled, and characters seems to come and go with no orientation given to the viewer. I am not saying that Michael Mann should pander to all audiences and dumb down the material, but a middle ground could have been found.

Mann shoots LA with wide-open empty spaces and stays high above the city for the most part, giving it a cold, alienating feel. Dante Spinotti's photography is raw and filter-free, and all locations are real with not a single soundstage used (although there are a couple of obvious green screen shots). It gives you a view of LA not typically seen in movies.

For a 170-minute it doesn't pay-off much considering the talent. There is a great 125-minute movie desperate to get out of Heat. The movie as it is has a lot of fat and you'll have to endure it if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

The Blu-ray is very underwhelming in 2.40:1 1080p with lots of weak blacks and a general DVD feel to it. For such a lauded and successful film Warner's effort here is very poor. The sound fares better in Dolby TrueHD (remember that?) and there are ZERO extras.",1402790400,,1868,4.498525073746313

3406812,5,B0017HRJ04,"One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",1396915200,9,923,4.566265060240964

Not certain why the language is what it is, but I suppose screenwriters feel actors aren't real unless they curse often.  I loved the coffee shop scene and the last scene at the airport is classic.  I'm still wondering how many cops would hold the hand of a man responsible for killing several of his fellow cops.

Poor Extras
-Just a few interviews and commentaries. They seem to have been recorded right after the film's original release, and are poorly scanned 4:3 480p SD. For instance, they'll have an interview boxed to fit 4:3, then cut to a letter-boxed scene from the film, leaving two-thirds of the screen black.

Lazy Transfer
-Heat's visuals have a high dynamic range, and it (generally) looks great on a properly adjusted TV. But there are a few problems with the transfer to HD.

3406859,5,B0017HRJ04,"10 years after the release of Michael Mann's epic crime tour de force, Heat is still an absolute masterpiece. Originally a screenplay which sat on the shelf for almost twenty years before being greenlit, Heat is the perfect character driven crime drama. Mann pits Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a dueling cop and crook whose lives bear stunning resemblances to themselves. Vincent (Pacino) becomes obsessed in his case to help escape the reality of his failing marriage, while Neil (De Niro) is a cool, calm, collected and disciplined master thief who, with his skilled team (including Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) are planning a heist which will change everyone involved forever. This portrait of these people and their failing personal lives sacrificed for their obsessive careers makes Heat the best film to come from Mann, and undoubtadly the best big budget crime drama to come out of the 90's. The face off between Pacino and De Niro is a film buff's dream, and the climactic LA shootout is possibly one of the best action sequences in cinematic history. The rest of the cast, which includes Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Kevin Gage, Denis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, Tom Noonan, and Hank Azaria, does brilliant work. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. This new 2-disc Special Edition from Warner Bros. contains a great commentary from Mann and a few nice featurettes, but the deleted scenes are hardly worth watching and add nothing to the film.",1376956800,33,1561,5.054263565891473
3406860,5,B0017HRJ04,"This is a fine action film.  The robbery scenes are taut, and the gun fighting is entirely unlike Hollywood's usual fare--in other words, realistic.  We also are treated to the first time that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear together on screen.  The two of them, portraying intense characters facing off over coffee while realizing that they also are more alike than someone who isn't a skillful thief or a dedicated police officer would want to admit.

But more than that, Heat is a tragedy.  Since that word is often misused, I'll explain that a tragedy is a drama in which the tragic hero comes to a bad end due to a flaw in his character.  Heat is Elizabethan tragedy.  If you know Shakespeare, you'll realize how many bodies that means.  In Hollywood, there are few genuine examples of this art form.  The weaving together of these characters' lives into one tight fall will provide the catharsis that powerful tragedy promises.

3406862,5,B0017HRJ04,"If you're into watching what happens when some people decide they're going to do it all in the length of a feature film, which I like, then this is worth watching for sure. Al Pacino is great and decides that this movie is going to be a film worthy of applause. Loved it.",1376784000,,271,4.132075471698113
3406863,5,B0017HRJ04,The perfect heist flick that we all wish we could do. Danny Ocean ain't got $#!& on this gang. Always recommend to anyone to watch.,1376784000,,131,4.28

3406866,4,B0017HRJ04,Pretty good.  For an '80s/'90s era movie that could have ended up being something like Point Break.  Because I watched Point Break after and OMG.,1376438400,,145,4.76
3406867,5,B0017HRJ04,Great theme with fabulous actors and plenty of drama and adventure.  Just the kind of movie I really like...  Wish there were more like this one.,1376352000,,145,4.538461538461538
3406868,5,B0017HRJ04,"Heat remains for me one of the great caper/crime films of all time, yet I never see it on any of the all-time great lists. Every single performance is excellent. The story line is totally engaging. The soundtrack is one of the best ever.  The ending of the film is absolutely iconic.  This film introduced me to the director, Michael Mann. This is his magnum opus.",1376092800,2,364,4.5
3406869,3,B0017HRJ04,"The solid performances and story are overshadowed by what I can only describe as an audio malfunction of the worst kind.  I viewed this movie with my volume level set at 100 (max) and still had difficulty hearing it.  Most blu-ray dvd's I watch around 40.  Great packaging.  Worst audio in my collection.  Hopefully, no one else has experienced this problem.  Would gladly return for a refund.",1376092800,3,393,4.791044776119403

3406871,3,B0017HRJ04,"blu-ray screen size was compressed but hd was noticeable.  Sound quality was horrible, I attribute that to the sound system in my lg 55"" tv.  Should have bought the regular version dvd. However the tv bluray that I watched was not compressed screen was full screen filled.",1375574400,,272,4.76595744680851
3406872,3,B0017HRJ04,"Again, here I am only reviewing the Blu Ray DVD treatment of Michael Mann's epic crime masterpiece, Heat.  This is one of my favorite films, and I am disappointed and confounded by the quality of the transfer.  The video is decent at best; the film is, in its original nature, very desaturated with a decent amount of natural film grain.  But what is the deal with the sound?  The audio is so unbelievably quiet, especially during dialogue!  While watching, I had the sound coming out of the TV's crappy default speakers, and a decent virtual surround sound speaker unit w/subwoofer.  During a scene with just dialogue and no music, I tried listening to how it sounded on just the TV's sound, and kept on increasing the volume to its absolute max - and it was still relatively quiet!  Then, only when I unmuted the surround and jacked its volume to the max did it sound only just competent!  This is absurd; I have watched other Blu Rays with the volume at a minimum and the audio's fidelity was crisp, dynamic and loud, just as it should be.  But not on this one.  It pisses me off because I wanted to experience this one as if I was in the theatre (especially for that brilliant shootout scene!) but I just couldn't get enough out of the audio.  Such an inexplicable fault; it should not be like this; it sounds exactly like its first lame DVD transfer from like back in '98, which is inexcusable.",1375142400,9,1399,4.490118577075099
3406873,5,B0017HRJ04,"Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore are so convincing in this classic cope & robbers movie. It don't get any better than this one! Get it. See it. Own it and watch it over and over again.",1374624000,,215,4.142857142857143

3406876,5,B0017HRJ04,"This movie was awesome. Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore what an excellent cast! Definitely had me sitting on the edge of my seat. If you like action, Heat definitely is worh watching.",1374364800,,218,4.7631578947368425

3406879,5,B0017HRJ04,"The Story builds on great acting and content, that eventually leads up to a big score Bank Robbery. The shootout that ensues, is the best I've ever seen. The Bad Guys, including Robert Deniro, all have large caliber semi-automatic weapons, that prevent the many Police and Detectives, including Al Pacino as Lead Detective, from making a clean Bust. As the Crew exits the Bank, is where one should turn up the volume. Very powerful. It lasts about 10 minutes. Excellently done, by Director Ed Mann. He was meticulous with the shootout scene. He spent about 9 days getting it perfectly done. Also, the background music adds to the build-up of excitement. The entire movie was very well done.
 For anyone who loves Cops and Robbers films, this is the movie to see, period.",1373673600,,770,4.7894736842105265
3406880,4,B0017HRJ04,"DeNiro was a better criminal than Pacino was a cop -- but they had to have a storybook ending where the bad guy gets killed even though DeNiro was standing in plain sight. If you leave your women behind script-writers, and movie audiences, require you to die.

Besides that it was a very gripping movie. Fantastic suspense.",1373673600,,323,4.666666666666667
3406881,5,B0017HRJ04,"Wow! De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer... this was a movie I resisted seeing and don't ask me why. I was very surprised with the actors, who are all great, and the story line. De Niro was at his best at being the bad/good guy who is only doing a job when they find a place to hit. He insists on his crew being methodical with as little interaction with people as possible, not wanting to get the police overly excited about just another robbery. This all goes horribly wrong with the admission of a psychotic ex con into their group that throws a wrench into their plans.  Enter Pacino, a dedicated at times overly excited detective(and no one plays excited like Pacino)that is determined to follow every lead that comes his way to stop the crew. De Niro is great as the head of the Crew and sad in may ways because of the life he leads and at one point realizes it. Although Jon Voight has a small part in the movie, it is essential to the plot and he is wonderful in his interaction with DeNiro. Val Kilmer is great as a member of the Crew that is very much in love with his wife and child although he has done the family life more harm than good but wants to do better. The entire plot appears to be a bit convoluted because of the many side plots involving the family of both the Crew and Pacino but somehow all fits together. Pacino and DeNiro do have a face to face after they discover each other and they learn they are not that different in their way of thinking if not their way of life. It is probably the best scene in the entire movie. This is one movie that deserved far more attention than it got and made me wonder why I waited so long to see it.",1373587200,,1651,4.159375
3406882,4,B0017HRJ04,The DVD has an inconsistent low level soundtrack and there are a few visual artifacts as well but I purchased this version for the additional information and interviews with the actors and Michael Mann which were well worth the price of admission. One of Hollywood's best character studies and a real lesson in psychology and human nature.,1373241600,,339,4.964912280701754
3406883,3,B0017HRJ04,"Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.  The video quality is decent, although some scenes are grainy.  Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the audio track is very low.  Once I cranked up the volume it was fine.",1373068800,2,222,4.5
3406884,3,B0017HRJ04,"Fantastic movie and the picture is incredible, but the sound mix is far too low.  I don't have a great sound-system, but I shouldn't have to turn the volume up as far as it will go to hear the dialog.  If you have good speakers/mixers, then give it a try.  But for me, the blu ray is almost unwatchable.",1372464000,,303,4.101694915254237
3406885,5,B0017HRJ04,"Pacino and DeNiro put forth a depiction of good vs bad by pitting cop (Pacino) against criminal (DeNiro) in a very believable plot.

The acting, emotion and realistic plot of a criminal's ultimate downfall due to the relentless pursuit of an obsessive cop leaves the viewer knowing they have seen a truly rare example of life on the street being portayed on the silver screen.",1371859200,,376,4.7846153846153845
3406886,5,B0017HRJ04,"Michael Mann is probably the most stylish director on the planet. He's an expert at building hypnotic tension into a movie. His sense of technical style is strong and it reflects in his films. heat especially. His movies are always gritty and realistic. Mann is to the action and thriller genre what Oliver Stone is to the political drama. Mann directs his films like they are serious business. Like he's an FBI agent out to solve a murder case. Serious, determined & dangerous. Heat is a perfect example of all of these Mann qualities rolled into one. The action sequences are powerful and breathtaking. The pace is slick and heartstopping during these sequences and the music during these moments keep the tension pounding at nail biting glory. Music is an important element in any Mann movie, and here Michael Mann expertly places each composition right up till the end credits when he uses a track by Moby to run into the credits. Music is so important for the flow of many Mann movies, and here it is so central that it might as well be one of the characters in the movie. As usual Pacino and De Niro turn in perfect performances. Note worthy and interesting also are Ted Levine, who played the killer in Silence of the lambs as one of investigating cops here, and the small cameo by Tom Noonan, who played the killer in Mann's film Manhunter. Both films were versions of the Thomas Harris novel Silence of the lambs. And the actors who played the killers in both films are featured in this movie. Though Heat does at times feel a bit long and slow, it can be forgiven because there is plenty of style and action to keep you interested. The plot and characters are all pretty interesting as well. Heat is a perfect film to use when you think of words like ""Blockbuster"" and ""Powerful"".",1371427200,2,1790,4.579439252336448

3406909,5,B0017HRJ04,"After more than 15 years, Heat still stands head and shoulders above the rest as one of the premier films in the genre. De Niro and Pacino are perfectly matched as driven professionals and polar opposites. The compelling irony of the movie is the intimation that the two would, in a different world, be friends and compatriots, as illustrated in their coffee shop scene.
Heat is a non-stop, action packed foray into a sort of spectator Stockholm syndrome that draws the viewer sympathetically into the lives of antagonist De Niro and his crew. There is so much focus on the bad guys that the line between Pacino's side and De Niro's is blurred all the way until the end.
Heat relies on fairly straightforward plot and action with no major surprise twists. Yet there is enough going on in the story to require the viewer to pay attention to events; it's easy to lose track of the sequence that progresses from start to finish.
Moby's presence throughout the soundtrack sharply enhances the film's gripping dramatic appeal. Heat's only downside for me is the inclusion of the the ever-smarmy and self-righteous Ashley Judd in the cast. But the rest of the actors and the characters they play are enough to pull attention away from her typically smug performance.
Heat is a must-have in your DVD or Blu-ray collection.",1365033600,,1315,4.797356828193832

They've taken a couple robberies, probably from old TV shows, and stretched them into three hours with a lot of irrelevant scenes like people sitting in bars or pulling up in cars. The stellar cast is totally wasted; Voight & Kilmer only have a few lines, Pacino's crude arrogant belligerence is a total turn-off. There are too many characters to get interested in any of them.  No thought was put into any of the robberies, they were pulled off with brute force.  If you like straightforward action movies you might like this, but it isn't what it says it is, don't be fooled by false advertising; can I get my $2 back?

At the end, when DeNiro has a choice, he chooses revenge rather than love. Look what happens to him. Val Kilmer, haha, he chooses otherwise. And...the dialogs!!! Awesone throughout the movie.

The film delves into the thoughts and lifestyles of both a dedicated officer and a career criminal.  Heat is a brilliant and epic crime drama.

The story in Heat places characters and story before action; therefore, don't expect 2 hours and 45 minutes of action-packed shootouts and chases. The characters, however, are deep and the dialogue is immersive. It all builds up to a monumental and benchmark heist scene that will keep you at your edge of your seat; this scene plays out so well thanks to the great choreography and editing. The ending of the film was also intense. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were magnificent, and so was the amazing supporting cast. I also enjoyed the music, particularly the credits song.

Overall, Heat is an amazing crime film, with a great cast, a superb story, and a brilliant, must-watch heist. I highly recommend a purchase.

3406925,5,B0017HRJ04,"The earliest memory I have for this movie was when I saw the famous shootout scene playing on a bunch of TVs in a Radio Shack in a shopping mall. The first time I saw the movie in its entirety was when I bought the double-disk DVD after watching the famous shootout clip again on youtube about six years ago or so. And it was worth every penny. It is a novel of a movie full of deep and interesting characters. The story is about about a cop and a thief. The cop is Lt. Vincent Hannah played by Al Pacino. An LAPD detective in the prestigious Robbery-Homicide Unit. He is in-charge of the detectives who investigate career criminal Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro and his crew of ex-cons doing all that they know how. Taking down scores and pulling heists. But when they rob an armored car and take bearer bonds belonging to a sleazy businessman named Van Zandt, they find themselves involved in a world of cheats and liars and backstabbers. Mr. Pacino and Mr. De Niro are the main focus of the film, as the movie is mostly about their duality. They see the other as the opposite side of the same coin. The minor characters are anything but minor. Waingro is a sociopath who loves to kill. He plays a very important part to the film's plot, especially for Neil's part of story. Other actors/actresses include Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Dennis Haysbert, Danny Trejo, Jon Voight, Amy Brennaman, Natalie Portman, Willam Fitchner, Wes Studi and more if I had left any out.
In conclusion, Heat is an elaborate tale of Cops & Robbers told from the point of view of the police, the criminals, their families, their friends and even their enemies. It is a story of people living their lives in the grand city of Los Angeles and dealing with everyday struggles of money, marriage/relationships, loyalty, trust and work. And it is about two people who carry guns for living. Except one of them wears a badge and the other wears a ski-mask.",1358640000,,1935,4.531428571428571

Now on to the video portion, it looks fantastic, I didn't see any grain what so ever, one scene that I always noticed the grain on with the DVD was when Hannah was having Neil followed by the chopper on the freeway, it looked quite bad, but on this blu ray, I saw NONE of that, so I was pleased with that, and the picture has nice detail to it, especially the shots of Los Angeles, especially during the shootout scene, I can see why Christopher Nolan was influenced by this movie when filming 'The Dark Knight'.

So thats my review, I didn't want to review the movie because fans of the movie already know this is a classic crime-drama, NOT ACTION, although it has quite a bit of action as well, it is a crime-drama, and a classic one at that, my focus was on the transfer itself, and like I said, yeah the audio could use some work, but as long as you don't mind turning it up, this is definetly worth purchasing, big advantage over the DVD, although the DVD does have a louder audio track, but the video on this one is so much better.

And all I had was the single disc edition DVD, so I was delighted to see that this blu ray comes with all the features that were featured on the 2 disc DVD, since I always wanted that version but never could find it around here, so that sweetened the pot for me.

He did a super job with this part, and if it had been better written he may have been nominated for an acting award. There is a hint of a subplot that goes no where. The way in which Waingro kills a hooker is poorly thought out and unrealistic.  It is a theme that runs through this film.

Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek. That persistent devotion to delaying the shrapnel in favor of more character-building does result in a tremendous ensemble of players, and ultimately we care about the fate of every one of them.

It's difficult to hold the interest of an audience for almost three hours, especially in an age where people can't go five minutes without checking their text messages or tweeting about what's happening in a movie. Heat was made in 1995 when it was much easier to forget the outside world for three hours, and that's part of its strength.

The most obvious thing to mention is that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear on screen together for the first time, and it's the first time they two have appeared in the same film since The Godfather: Part II. Both actors are close to their best and their two meetings are memorable.

Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) works for the LAPD. His job is his passion and he places it above personal relationships. He's on his third marriage and that is failing because he only gives his wife a fraction of his attention if he's home at all. Neil McCauley (De Niro) also has a passion, but he's on the wrong side of the law. He heads a group of thieves who are professional and extremely effective. Unlike Hanna, McCauley doesn't want any personal ties preventing him from being the best he can be.

McCauley has a favorite quote:

""Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner.""

The movie shows us how effective McCauley's crew is when they rob an armored truck early in the movie. One of the crew, Waingro (Kevin Gage), is a loose cannon. His behavior leads to three unnecessary deaths so McCauley decides to kill him. Unfortunately, a passing patrol car distracts McCauley and allows Waingro to escape. He's a constant source of trouble for the remainder of the story.

McCauley's life changes when he meets Eady (Amy Brenneman). Instead of being a free agent, he's in danger of becoming tied down to a relationship. Will he abandon the idea that he can walk away from any situation in 30 seconds, or will she complicate things?

What sets Heat apart is the strong characterization. Mann takes his time establishing all of the characters, even if they have minor roles. As a result, we feel as if we know these people. McCauley's strengths and efficiency are obvious and we learn the roles and abilities of the other crew members. Mann doesn't stop there. We see one crew member, Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer), interacting with his wife (Ashley Judd). Chris has a gambling problem and it's affecting his marriage. His wife questions whether they should even be together. This type of depth is present throughout the movie.

Because we know the characters, it matters when something happens to them. Hanna's life is his job and he's essentially a hunter. McCauley is his current prey and we see Hanna using every available tool to find out what McCauley's crew is planning. As he learns more about McCauley, Hanna finds that he respects the man. They are similar in many ways and both are intelligent.

The most notable scene in the movie happens after Hanna pulls over McCauley in his car. He's not there to arrest him, but simply asks if they can have coffee together. The scene shows the personalities of both men and it's brilliantly written. Hanna mentions that it's his job to stop McCauley and that it's nothing personal. McCauley replies with a warning that he would have to take Hanna out if he got in his way. These are not threats, but calmly-stated facts. The scene is based on a real exchange between McCauley and Chicago cop, Chuck Adamson. If you think the scene is unrealistic, it really happened.

Heat is a drama more than anything else, but the brief action scenes are intense. The actors received training to make their shootouts appear authentic. Mann's focus on such details makes the whole story feel real. When we see people working at a crime scene, many are real forensic experts.

I can't promise 170 minutes of thrills, but the final scenes are among the most intense I've seen portrayed within the genre. All of the acting is good, but Pacino and De Niro understandably dominate things. If you enjoy character-driven stories, Heat is well worth your time.",1334707200,,4128,4.710124826629681

3406961,5,B0017HRJ04,"I might of made a bold statement with my title but I fully stand by it and will defends it's position.
I have revisited this film multiple times and in different age brackets as well. As I get older though, I can't help but to extol this film more and more. It is not so often that a film can offer a stellar cast, a satisfying plot, powerful acting, realistic character interactions, and excellent cinematography.

Michael Mann's Heat which went unnoticed somewhat in 1995 has finally garnered enough attention to warrant an anniversary edition (15th) which will be heading into it's 20th year shortly. (hard to believe) At any rate, this film is proving time and time again why it's receieving the attention it finally deserves.

Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the homocide division of the LAPD and confronts the work of a highly skilled and methodical antagonist, Neil McCauley, (Robert De Niro) after a armored truck heist. Like Neil, Vincent is a master of his craft; dedicated, committed, passionate and just downright professional. It borderlines the point of obsession, or as wife succinctly puts it, ""It is the only thing he is committed to doing."" The only problem for Vincent is managing this demanding career and at the sametime reconciling the needs of his father/husband role at home. His emotionally disturbed step daughter, Lauren, (Natalie Portman) is quite the handful. Her emotional outbursts and not to mention a half way successful attempt at suicide is troubling indeed. Vincent's 3rd wife, Justine (Diane Venora) painstakingly and miserably fails to have her husband, and previous husband participate in Lauren's life.

Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a lone wolf; introverted, organized and very professional. He is a dedicated criminal and trusts his fellow crew members: Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) Nate (Jon Voight) Michael Cherrito (Tom Seizmore) Trejo (Danny Trejo) Waingro (Kevin Gage). During an armored heist, Waingro (a new crew member) is informed by Neil not to kill any of the guards in the truck as this is already established with the other crew members. Unfortunately, Waingro cannot handle the heat (No pun intended) during the operation and intentionally kills one of the guards before leaving the scene. Although the robbery is a success, an unnceccesary dead man is left behind for Vincent to start analyzing and fitting in the pieces of evidence.

At a local diner, Neil and the crew know what must be done in terms of punishment for Waingro's misconduct during the heist. During their departure from the diner, Neil attempts to kill Waingro in the parking lot but is abruptly delayed from a local police officer patrolling nearby. As a result, Waingro escapes undetected but not entirely unscathed either. This sets up the 2nd chase between these two men. Waingro is not only a killer on the loose but a rapist too as we see later in the film.

The chases between these characters are so well choreographed that the three hour run time seems like a 25 minute sit com episode. Michael Mann is successful at making the characters so real in their world. Moreover, he makes their interactions real and invokes such a genuine sense of familiarity with them. He invites you into their crime life, their family life, and their social life. No character in this film is belittled or made to seem less important when acting side by side with the main characters. Michael Mann treats every character with such equality; and, in effect, their emotional impact is significant and powerfully lasting.

For example, Donald Breedan who plays a small role in this film (Dennis Haysbert) is a friend of Neils that just served time and is on parole working as a grill man in a local diner. Although his onscreen time is probably less than five minutes his interactions are so carefully crafted that his subsequent death as Neil's personal driver during a bank heist is quite sad, especially when we see his girlfriend's reaction to his death when shown on the television nightly news. In retrospect, Michael Mann creates realism to his environments. He familiarizes his audience with the characters, the landscape (Streets of LA) and everything in between. Nothing is left unscathed, Michael Mann is professional just like Neil and Vincent are.

Some may not agree with me, but I would be more than happy to defend my statement above because I really haven't seen a film with Al Pacino or Robert De Niro that fulfills these aspects. But enlighten me, I am open to hearing differing opionions.",1327622400,,4528,4.957839262187088

3406969,1,B0017HRJ04,"I was so excited to get this Blu Ray. I LOVE this movie but was extremely disappointed. The video transfer is great, but the audio just flushes it down the toilet. There is no consistency between the sound effects and the voices. The dialog seems muffled and drowned out. It's very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. The sound effects such as explosions and gunshots are very loud and I was constantly adjusting the volume to my AV receiver. I agree with other reviewers on this terrible Blu Ray transfer that ruins a Fantastic movie. Hopefully a new release down the road will fix the audio issues.",1323043200,15,620,4.697247706422019

Very suspenseful with lots of action and keeps your attention well from beginning to the end.  There is a lot of violence as well and would not call it a family movie.  Even though it is 15 years old, it might still be one of the best combined action/suspense movies I have seen.  If you like mystery/crime films with a ton of action, then be sure to watch it if you have not already.

3406971,1,B0017HRJ04,"First, the conclusion:  Don't buy this ersatz ""Blu-Ray"" disc from Warner Bros.  According to almost every technical standard, it stinks.  I should have learned by now that the combination of ""Blu-Ray"" and ""Warner Bros."" means that the video transfer is ""Blu-Ray"" only according to the box label.  That said, this transfer is bad even by Warner Bros pathetic standards.  To make sure my growing prejudice was not interfering with my judgment, I screened the Blu-Ray edition  side by side with the standard DVD version without comment to nine friends and neighbors.  Of nine viewers, five couldn't spot in difference in video quality, two liked the Blu-Ray marginally better, and two liked the regular DVD version better. Though less important than the video quality, the menu options and functionally are awful--cheap, clunky, and almost unbelievably limited.  I've seen better interactive menus on Hong Kong bootleg discs.  Rumors abound that Warner Bros is going to be redoing many of the lousy Blu-Ray selections they've issued in the last few years, but so far there is nothing except rumor.  Market dynamics are supposed to weed out inferior products, but my guess is that many consumers simply don't realize just how inferior some brand offerings are.  So, here's to the informed consumer:  Again, don't waste your money on this low-quality product and show Warner Bros. that we are all a bit smarter than they obviously  think we are.",1321142400,19,1440,5.102564102564102

3406976,5,B0017HRJ04,"Just finished viewing my new Blu-Ray version of Michael Mann's masterpiece and I must tell you that it never looked and sounded better at the home theater. I have all previous DVD versions  including Japanese one with DTS sound  and they all pale in comparison. So pay no attention to negative reviews here- they may have received faulty discs or their equipment is not up to date but I sure don't know what they talking about. THE FILM LOOKS AND SOUNDS BRAND NEW COMPARED TO ALL DVD VERSIONS.

Now, there have been complaints about the cuts in the dialogue between Al Pacino (Vincent) and Diane Venora ( Justine)
 Well, first of all any and all content changes were made by Michael Mann himself and here for once the  creator of the film could go back and improve on the original. And rightly so, for in my view the scenes between Vincent and his annoying wife (including their gratuitous love making) are the weakest part of the movie. Has not it become the cliche-the dedicated cop and his nagging wife/ girlfriend who wants him to stay at home instead of chasing bad guys?  She knew who he was when she married him yet she's acting all surprised when he doesn't show up for dinner on time because of his work!
But I am digressing!
Here's the bottom line:for those who know and love the film like I do-just get the blu-ray! For those who don't know this film-shame on you!",1300320000,2,1375,4.502008032128514
3406977,1,B0017HRJ04,"As other reviewers have noted here, this Blu-Ray (unfortunately like Miami Vice, also from director Michael Mann) lacks the crisp HD picture detail that the Blu-Ray format should have on every title. Once you've seen a good Blu-Ray (think Public Enemies, Fight Club or 2001), then watching a sub-par one is that much more disappointing.

Maybe the studios think we're daft in the head, that they can churn out Blu-Ray titles that lack true HD picture and we won't notice the difference until they can then issue a remastered version for yet another unit sale. Since the DVD format is going away, there's a lot of this going around it seems. Skip this version unless you really don't care what it looks like. This is a great film. It deserves better than this.",1286582400,19,759,4.706766917293233
3406978,5,B0017HRJ04,"4.5 stars

The rating is for the movie...the dvd gets 3 and the blu-ray 2, if just for also including a good hourlong doc, Mann's commentary, 10 minutes of ok deleted scenes, and a picture that is mildly but not much better than the dvd. If you already love this film and are wondering about the blu-ray, wait for the double dip that you just know is on the way.

That said, this really is a special film. Though not perfect---it's a little too long and has a few too many lingering shots of emotionally wraught faces caught in lovers' quarrels for my taste---those are quibbles, and the strengths far outweigh any flaws.

The acting is the real highlight; both DeNiro and Pacino are at the top of their games here, and their scene together is truly one of the great tete-a-tetes of modern actors that I know of. They're both completely inside their roles in every scene, and Al's over the top moments work every time for me, not easy considering how far over some of them are. Bob's slow burn couldn't be more exact, and those two performances alone make this well worth watching.

But then add in very nice turns from almost everyone else; Voight and Kilmer and Sizemore and Judd are all perfect, and in fact I can't think of one performance here that is less than good to very good. And there's a lot of acting from many folks, so Mann did what he's been able to do in almost no other picture: get solid, natural work from all of his actors.

Mann himself is at his peak here; his best writing by far and also his most convincing direction. Less of the Mann trademark shimmering-lights-at-night vibe (but still plenty, he can't help it and why should he, it works) and more simple shots of good actors doing what they do best. He gets far better performances than usual from everyone here, no doubt due to Al and Bob being on set and making everyone step their games up to their limit; you don't want to suck with these two around you!

The opening and late action/heist scenes are two of the best of the past 20 years for my money, and they contrast so well with the personal, emotional moments throughout the film. I could have taken a few less of those and more of Voight, for instance (who is excellent here), but all in all Heat delivers the goods and is likely to be seen as Mann's peak once all is said and done, followed perhaps by Thief.

But just rent this one for now...a much much better transfer is due to show up soon, and a movie this good deserves no less.",1280016000,2,2475,4.3673913043478265
3406979,2,B0017HRJ04,"Ok gang I purchased Heat years ago when It first came out on dvd. This was my all time favorite movie. Michael Manns camera angles and night shots are great the original sound track was great especially the gun fights, helicopter passes and planes at Lax landing. Purchased the blue ray with high hopes. I saw some improvement in the picture, ok not bad, But what the heck happend to the sound track? Its like watching a Japanese Godzilla movie. Very obvious delay in sound track the mouth moves and a second later the word is heard. The shoot outs are worse, you hear a bang and count to 1 and theres the flash.

3406981,1,B0017HRJ04,"Well like some other people, I purchased this great movie on Blu Ray and so excited to do so.

And like some people have noticed, there are problems with this.

First I did notice that a few scenes were deleted for some reason.  Can't understand why though.

Also, there is an audio flaw problem, where you have to turn it up the volume on the TV to hear them talk, then turn it down right away when you hear anything else (like a gunshot, explosion, etc.).  This is something similar to the new Star Trek The Original Series release on Blu Ray where the audio has the same problem on a few episodes.

I have a brand new PS3 Slim by the way and yes it does work fine.  I also have ""Blade Runner"" on Blu Ray and it is flawless!  I highly recommend that by the way.  It's perfect.

But this version of heat also had a few scenes that weren't high def.  Very disappointing about that.

Well, I picked it up for $9, but I won't be keeping it.  I will look for the older DVD release instead.

Supported by Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, and many more great neighbors, this is truly a DVD you must have, if you collect any movies at all. There is a brief scene in a diner between the leads that is worth the whole purchase, and that's just one scene. If you don't watch that one over and over, why do you watch movies at all ?
Every actor spot on, a good story about professional good and evil, romance, and how it can make your life a struggle, all filmed, directed, and edited with brilliance, make this movie superb for folks who like this sort of thing.

Unfortunately I have still never gotten he chance to really enjoy this movie. They screwed up the audio on this Blu ray disk something terrible. I mean, for a large portion of this film, I could barely hear what the characters were saying. Let me just say that i have a pioneer elite receiver with def tech mythos speakers, so i have a system that can rock the room. At times I had it turned up all the way to try to understand and then i would get killed by the music or an action scene of course. I read all of the review sites and they are all rating the audio as near perfect and I cant believe they are watching the same disc. I even went to blockbuster and rented it, and I had the same problem. I also Put it into a different blu ray player and no luck. They just did an awful job with the audio on this blu ray. Also, I am 22 years old and have passed every hearing check with flying colors, just in case you thought I was an old fart with terrible hearing.
