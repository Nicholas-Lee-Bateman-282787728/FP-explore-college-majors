1209446,5,B00000FAQR,"There have been numerous movies entitled ""The Ring"".  This review concerns the 1952 version of The Ring.  (The 1955 in the Amazon caption is a mistake)  This version stars Lalo Rios, Rita Moreno, Gerald Mohr, Jack Elam and the great Mexican American Boxer, Art Aragon.
From the box cover, ""Recognition is  an essential ingredient in being human and The Ring is an unforgiving caldron in which to learn of your self.  The dream of life, to become all you are capable of being, is pounded into you daily by your family, friends, strangers and prejudice, yet we all cling to the dream.  The dream: the way life could and should be.  Tomas Cantanos (Lalo Rios), having been molded by the streets, sees the glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel and goes for it.  Along the way he meets himmslef, along the way he meets life.""
Tomas Cantanos is a young Mexican American growing up in the segregated Los Angeles of the early 1950's.  He is frustrated and poor and has access only to limited opportunities. One evening Tommy is observed in a bar room brawl by a boxing manager. He is impressed with Tommy's prowess with his fists and convinces him to go to the gym and persue a career in the ring.  The movie follows Tommy's rise and fall in the ring and his subsequent growth as a human being.
The Ring is your basic Hollywood immigrant drama where the new American must overcome racism and adversity to find himself and his place in American society.  The story and acting are solid but nothing spectacular.
What made this a great movie for me was seeing Mexican American life in 1950's Los Angeles.  There are great scenes of Tommy hanging out with his Pachuco friends at their club house.  When I heard the Mambos and saw the cool suits, I could only think of my father's youth.  I also loved the boxing scenes set in the great fight auditoriums of the 1950's.  I had read of the great champion, Art Aragon, the Oscar de la Hoya of his day. It was great to see him in the ring.  Finally, I had heard stories of the racism that Mexicans faced in the 1950's and it was powerful for me to see this racism portrayed on the screen.
On the screen, Mexican Americans have been all but ignored.  This movie is more than 50 years old and still is as relevent and interesting as it was on the day it was released.  The Ring is a wonderful mirror into 1950's Los Angeles.",1074902400,10,2360,4.4110854503464205

1209448,5,B00000FAQR,"The Ring
This is one of the last movies, where many people can enjoy, with fear, scare, yelling, because you can not close your eyes.
Even though I watched ""The Ring"" I could feel the mystery inside it.
The movie is about a magic that you have to discover. Some staff happened inside and outside of an old house. Where lives a strange family. One of them is a girl. She asked for another child who has life, a soul, and a body. Her mother had a sister, who died, and she wants to know why did she die. She went to exact place where her sister was before she died.
The place was terrible, but she wanted to choose ""The ring""
The movie was awful, because she watched some darks places, trees, mirrors, windy. There was a ring at the end of the movie. That means that it caught you. This is the worst part.
As soon as you watch ""The Ring,"" you will know that Satan wants you. You just have seven days for to be alive.
While the days have passed, she found something important, and she felt like to help another people like her son.
But is pretty difficult to find the exit when you play that game, or someone watched this movie, you'll never be back. You'll feel like between two fires: the death and ""The Ring"" behind the scenes.
To sum up, you are bound to enjoy this horror movie because we don't expect the end. Everyone will take pleasure in ""The Ring"".
If you want to have fun, go to the cinema or rent it. It doesn't matter if you don't enjoy watching this kind of movie because this has a different casting, and I had the big time.
I enjoy watching any kind of movies, so go ahead!",1038268800,3,1586,4.186274509803922
1209449,2,B00000FAQR,"The film has some scary moments, but there are all too many loose ends.  One walks away with many questions; poor overall plot with lots of unexplained happenings.  I've seen much better.",1038182400,,187,4.8125
7907987,5,B00000FAQR,"This gutsy little boxing drama -- refreshingly set in 1952 LA's burgeoning Mexican American community -- defies the usual
cliches of race, class and goons running the fight game to deliver a heartfelt drama about  how  ""the Sweet Science"" both
helped and thwarted attempts by working class kids to join the American mainstream. All great films rely on great casts
and superior scripts. The quality of The Ring emerges in a first act locker room meeting between two kid boxers.
  Tommy Kansas (the ring name adopted by young actor Laolo Rios) and Billy Smith (the sublimely boyish  mid-20's
gay film actor Robert Arthur)  nervously exchange small talk and a hand shake before their scheduled 4 round preliminary
bout. Despite knowing that one of them will suffer a possiably career ending beating, the boys wish each other luck
and proceed to have a scrappy  two round fight. It's the only time in the film that Tommy will meet another kid pugilist as
a fellow human being and foreshadows the film's big lesson about sportsmanship and real meaning of swinners and
losers. The camera work is acutely on target allowing us to feel the punches and wonder about the futures of these
two golden boys.
  In the same league with the genre's best Raging Bull, Golden Boy, The Champion, The Ring deserves a revival
and showings on Turner Movie Classics as an example that kids with good hearts can reach across society's
barriers to express something approaching love.
  Also for LGBTQ viewers The Ring provides a rare chance to see a talanted queer performer before it was
fashionable to be out and visible. Robert Arthur can also be seen as Kirk Douglas' plucky boy-sidekick in the
New Mexico set man trapped in a cave drama Ace in the Hole. Arthur as the idealistic young cub reporter HerbiCook is arguably one of the most decent and most inspiring characters to ever appear",1459296000,,1867,4.821316614420063

7907989,1,B00000FAQR,"Amazon Instant Video. The Ring from 1952 is incomplete. An edited version as are many Amazon Prime films. You want to see a complete film ... It costs. Amazon throws a Prime tag on all the edited, grainy, noisy junk and calls it a benefit. It's obviously missing parts. The true running time is 1h20m. Netflix ain't perfect but I've not caught them misrepresenting edited films. Some of the missing time is used to paint an even worse portrait of bad Caucasian treatment of Mexican Americans than the film intended. The film deals with the social issues of the times in Los Angeles but the edit makes it heavy handed, or more so. As far as Rita Moreno, she's pretty here but she wasn't done yet. In 10 years she'd reach beautiful. The leading character makes the film hard to watch. He carries himself as a stranger in a strange land. Going where he pleases, where he's obviously unwelcome to everyone but him. Yet he's from LA. Just dumb. The almost absent boxing sequences are great.",1410739200,,985,4.6022727272727275

Amazon is not to be trusted when it comes to an Amazon Prime movie. I've seen this practice too many times. If you want a complete movie... It costs extra.

7907991,4,B00000FAQR,Story of a Mexican American boxer in Los Angeles during the 1950's.  Lots of great period location scenes around L.A.  Good story and an excellent print.  Not a splice nor blemish throughout.  This is one of VCI's hits(out of their history of hits and misses).,1379894400,2,260,4.711111111111111
7907992,5,B00000FAQR,This was great movie in great shape as well it came on time.  I hadn't seen this movie in lets see i was 12 when i first saw it i am 60 now. It was great to see it again,1361318400,,169,3.225
7907993,4,B00000FAQR,"The Ring exudes period L.A. cultural context. Lalo Rios is natural and raw in this early work of his. Too bad his career was cut short by the black/gray lists. This movie is a must for those who want a glimpse of the not-too-distant past in Los Angeles and especially, East LA's cast off status.",1311379200,4,295,4.381818181818182
7907994,5,B00000FAQR,"I bought this movie because my Chicano Studies 101 professor offered extra credit if we watched it. My dad and I had a good time watching it and we both loved it. It has a good story to it and you learn of how Mexican-Americans faced discrimanation. I also did a little research on it and found out it was either one of the first OR the first movie that actually featured Mexican actors playing Mexicans (before, ""tanned"" or darker-skinned white men would often play Mexicans or Hispanics). I would recommend this for someone who is into black and white films and enjoys learning about history.",1264032000,3,594,4.613207547169812
7907995,5,B00000FAQR,"Set in Los Angeles the early 1950's, Tommy a troubled Mexican American resolves his problems with fast fists.  A boxing trainer sees him brawl and offers him an opportunity to enter the fight game.  It appears that boxing will be Tommy's ticket out of the barrio.  It is a cruel world and Tommy will learn if he has what it takes to make it.

This film will appeal primarily to two audiences.  First, this film will deeply resonate with Mexican Americans.  There is not a lot of existing popular culture that shows what Mexican American life in East Los Angeles was like in the 1950's.  For me it was a real pleasure to see the Pachucos and their Mambos caputured in a Hollywood film.  Change a few of the elements and this is a film that could be remade today and it would still be powerful.

This film will also appeal to those who love boxing from the Golden Age of the 1950's. There are beautiful shots of the Olympic Auditorium that are rich in the atmosphere of the time.  As an added bonus, Art Aragon, the Oscar de la Hoya of the time also makes a cameo appearence. If you love the period, ""The Ring"" is a classic of the genre.

Finally, there is another boxing film of the period titled, ""Right Cross"" which stars a young Ricardo Montalban.  He is a young Mexican American boxer who falls in love with an American girl.  Hopefully, this film will one day be reissued.",1231286400,2,1376,4.391304347826087
7907996,5,B00000FAQR,"If you like old movies and were ever involved in the ""movimiento"" you will most certainly like this movie. For those Latinos who think the struggle is new you may be surprised. It's a simple movie with deep overtones. It will make you angry and also make you laugh. This movie is a gem I accidently came across. I bought it because the price was right and I'm glad I did. I'm an older dude from the old school so It was easy for me to relate to this movie. Considering the time it was filmed I'm surprised it was ever released. It is a politically charged movie designed to make you think.",1197936000,2,589,4.221238938053097
