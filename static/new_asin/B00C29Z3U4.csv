5687805,3,B00C29Z3U4,"If you cannot kneel comfortably then this workout is not for you.  I cannot get comfortable with my weight on my knees and I cannot ""sit in a comfortable cross legged position"" so this workout is not my favorite.  I have all of her Studio and Live workouts and really enjoy them all.  I will probably keep this one in the rotation but I'm still trying to figure out how to modify to accomodate my Baker's cyst and sore ankes.  It's not all lying down!",1381968000,2,451,4.270588235294118

5687807,5,B00C29Z3U4,"While I do know that I've enjoyed Ellen Barrett's workouts, I didn't know what to expect from a floor-based workout. Wow! This workout isn't the easy breeze I thought it might be. It's definitely a good challenge. I frequently suffer with foot problems, and this is a great option for me when those problems are flaring up. However, I don't limit this to just those times when I want to be off my feet. Great video!",1377302400,7,415,4.473684210526316
5687808,3,B00C29Z3U4,"This is an unusual workout.  It does stretch and relax you.  It has a few really challenging moves - but most are pretty easy.  I just don't feel all that ""worked out"".  I don't know if I'll keep this one....most likely not.  Too easy overall and too relaxing.",1375920000,5,260,4.333333333333333
5687809,3,B00C29Z3U4,"This workout is definitely different to Ellen's other DVDs - there's no standing ... at all.  I admit I was a bit sceptical about the ability to get a good work out when there is no standing required. But this is definitely not a lazy girl's work out and you will feel sore the next day. Heck, I didn't realise how hard it would be to keep one leg raised (parallel to the floor) to do leg circles while balanced on the knee of my other leg and hand. Curse you gravity!

It's not a cardio workout - but your heart will be pounding as you fight gravity. A towel or similiar to cushion your knees is a must - I am 36 and do not have knee issues but bone (with the added weight of your body) plus a hard surface is never a good combination - especially in the long run!",1375574400,24,765,3.9934640522875817
5687810,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I have been a fan of Ellen for many years, with Slim Sculpt a longtime foundation of my fitness regimen. I also like Fusion Flow a lot, so I was anxious to try this new version of The Fusion Method. This floor workout is very enjoyable, not too tough but tough enough, a relaxing and energizing flow class. The reverse planks are a revelation! The plank work is challenging but very excellent work.  I have struggled with shoulder placement after a bad injury (broken shoulder and arm) and this workout really helps open the chest, drop the scapula back onto the ribs and open the collarbones, comfortably and with a soothing flow! This workout is wonderful for balance and opening the front of the body, I really enjoy the side plank stretch series and the back lifts. Ellen is pitch perfect on cuing as usual, and still her perky self too. As with most of Ellen's workouts, this can be done easy or hard, depending on your mood and how much you push yourself.  I love it. On easy days I like to use the Fusion Flow warmup and then the entire Fusion Floor class. She makes a small mistake of doubling the reps of the hip to toe leg circles, doing 8 each way on one side but 16 each way on the other side, not cool but once you're aware you can roll with it. The spine work is very excellent in this class, a real posture fixer.  I am very very grateful to Ellen for being great and for her personal accessibility too. I appreciate that she leaves in small mistakes like a counting error and a few others, it makes her very real and likeable. I love this class.",1375488000,4,1561,4.320819112627986

I've been looking for a workout where I don't stand on my feet and this one is perfect!!!  I've list inches and toned my body just by sitting ,kneeling ,or on my back. I love this workout and I've worked up to doing it everyday. It's amazing how much better I feel and the energy is returning.",1455753600,,381,4.366197183098592

5687867,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I just love Ellen Barrett's Fusion Floor Workout!!!  Ellen combines effective a workout routine which targets the belly area. The entire 46 minutes are performed on the floor, from warm-up to cool down.",1424044800,,202,5.121212121212121
5687868,2,B00C29Z3U4,"I'd say I have 11 of Ellen's workouts, being following her for six years and love every single one of her DVDs....but this one.  While I was definitely excited to try an entire workout on the floor (and who wouldn't be), I just don't like it from the side leg lifts pretty much all the way to the end (although I love that she does pigeon pose on this DVD).

For one, it may be me, but she seems to do wayyyyyy too many side leg lifts on the left side. That just seemed to aggravate me.  And from then on out, I just really didn't enjoy the exercises, not like I enjoy the ones on her other DVDs. For instance, during one exercise she seems to want you to do them as fast as you can and that didn't seem very ""Ellen Barrett""-like to me at all.  It seemed like you used momentum rather than control.  The music isn't very soothing or calming either, one song almost reminded me of something you'd hear during a funeral march. I was really hoping for this to be more like the exercises during the floor portion on her other DVDs.  Her instruction was excellent though, as it always is. While I LOVE her other workouts, and have just been doing all Ellen DVDs exclusively for the past couple months, this one actually leaves me irritated and underwhelmed at the end, and I really don't feel like I did much when I'm finished, when compared to her other workouts. I've done it several times, trying to give it a chance.  But I've concluded I just don't like this one.  Others seem to like it well enough, but it won't be one I do often, if at all.",1422489600,4,1543,4.224489795918367

5687871,3,B00C29Z3U4,"I usually enjoy Ellen's workouts and would chose to do them on days I lacked the energy for an intense cardio or strength workout....now that I'm older and don't work out as consistently as I use to, I do her workouts more often than others. I chose this one to add to my collection and the first time I did it I could not make it through it bc of boredom. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the mornings I feel lazier than lazy. I have appreciated it more the more I have done it however, I would not say this is a good one for massive calorie burn. The first twenty minutes is more like a cool down than a warm up or real exercise. On the positive side, it is very relaxing and still invigorating. There are a few moves that are new so that's good and I do find the routine helpful for my anxiety. So if you want an easy day or forty min of relaxing in a healthy way than I recommend it. If you want to break a sweat...not so much.",1409616000,3,946,3.9581151832460733

5687884,4,B00C29Z3U4,"don't let the fact that it's an entire workout on the floor make you think it will be easy ~ Ellen is the best when it comes to ""deceptively challenging"" workouts. this routine starts out, like all of her workouts, gentle and pleasant. it continues in the same manner, but because of her fabulous encouragement and positive attitude, progresses in intensity; you'll work hard, but it's so enjoyable. i have to also add that i've had such great results incorporating  Ellen's workouts into my lifestyle and am always happy after completing them! highly recommend!",1402358400,,562,4.9787234042553195
5687885,4,B00C29Z3U4,"I love Ellen Barrett. I have done almost every single workout she has come out with. I especially love Ellen's pilates matwork. Her early Crunch ""Pick Your Spot Pilates,"" introduced me to her pilates and I was hooked! She has so many great pilates moves sprinkled throughout all of her workouts. If you are familiar with Ellen's workouts, you know that she almost always has a 15 minute matwork segment at the end of her workouts. I love these segments and I am always wishing for more matwork! I wanted a full Ellen workout that was all on the mat, when I saw Fusion Floor Workout, I thought this would be just what I was looking for! I love Ellen's fusion method, and I love matwork, so this DVD should be perfect.

Maybe my expectations were high, and I think I was expecting the wrong thing. This is not like Ellen's other matwork! If that's what you're are looking for, this is not it. Instead, this is completely different from anything Ellen has ever done in my opinion. It is a very relaxing workout. I think this is a good workout for those light days, and days where you really want to get a workout in and relax yourself at the same time. Its definitely unique and there are some great moves in this DVD! I agree with a previous reviewer that fighting gravity is the biggest challenge here. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser and I was more relaxed than challenged; however, there are challenging moves.

Yes, the entire workout takes place on the floor, yes it is different, but for me, it is still Ellen! I am one of those people that think you cannot go wrong with an Ellen workout. Her cueing is always perfect, her attitude and demeanor is so pleasant, and her moves are always unique and effective. I was expecting something different, but I enjoyed what I got. If you really like a relaxing workout with a lot of stretching, this is a great workout for you. If you like high intensity toning, sculpting, and cardio - this is NOT for you! And obviously, if you prefer standing workouts, do not buy this DVD.",1402185600,8,2033,4.491891891891892
5687886,5,B00C29Z3U4,I like Ellen Barrett's workouts.  This one is tough.  If you want an upper body workout this one is for you.  She will challenge you.,1399248000,3,133,4.24

5687888,5,B00C29Z3U4,"Just received this 45minute DVD, one word: AWESOME! This a cardio sculpt with NO mental gymnastics. There's something about her workout style ballet+pilates+yoga [cardio+strength+stretch] that kinda makes you feel sexy when you're working out....45mins flies by...I prefer the 30min workouts but I had to take one for the team and try the 45min since the 30min were so energizing and fun! I've been working out with Ellen Barrett for 13yrs now [I'm 48] and she has the best workouts I've ever done especially this new barefoot fusion fitness series. I also have the 30min Super Fast body blast and the 30min sleek & sculpt which are equally awesome.",1397088000,7,649,5.018518518518518
5687889,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I love Ellen Barrett's workouts.  She makes keeping up simple and her exercises are not too strenuous, yet you come away sweating and feeling like you've worked hard.  It's almost a relaxing way to workout.  I always feel great after I'm done.  Ellen is very inspirational.  Other 'instructors' come off annoying, but she kind of just gives you a little push to keep you going.  I have Superfast  Bodyblast too, and love it.",1396828800,,424,4.726027397260274
5687890,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I ordered this dvd because I wanted a low-key workout that relaxed me and provided stress relief, and yet had toning and stretching benefits...And that's exactly what I got! Once again, Ellen Barrett doesn't disappoint...I love this workout on days when I come home from a stressful day at work and want to wind down, yet still get in a productive workout. It's also good for days when I know I'm going for a walk or doing some other cardio, but still want to work my muscles.

As with all of Ellen's workouts that I've tried, this one has strengthening and stretching moves that complement each other, and every move works multiple body parts. Because it makes the most of my time, I feel like I'm getting a lot out of it...and I'm always 'feeling it' the next day!",1396224000,2,766,4.510791366906475
5687891,5,B00C29Z3U4,My wife and I use it at least twice a week and alternate it with Weight Loss Pilates.  Ellen Barrett does a good job of explaining the moves and breathing and the routines themselves are fun and moderately difficult.  The added bonus is that one of the demonstrators does alternates for folks who aren't up to the full moves.,1395532800,,325,4.491525423728813
5687902,5,B00C29Z3U4,"Don't be fooled that this is an easy workout.  You will know that you exercised after 45 minutes of down dog and push ups.  I hurt the next day, but felt stronger.  My husband and I both do this workout.",1394841600,,203,4.025
5687903,5,B00C29Z3U4,"This is the 4th Ellen Barrett dvd that I've bought, and I like this one the best.  It sounds like it would be easier because the workout is done entirely on the floor, and it is definitely not a cardio workout, but it is the best of hers so far at strengthening and toning all over the body.  It is just what I was looking for in a workout.",1391817600,10,340,3.9130434782608696
5687904,2,B00C29Z3U4,"I love Ellen, her approach is wholistic and very healthy. I was really hoping that this video would incorporate all her interesting mat work that you find sprinkled throughout her previous videos. It really doesn't. It really should not be advertised as a workout, it is more of a relaxation and strech video; which is what Ellen keeps saying through out the video. I think it was marketed incorrectly. If you are even remotely fit this will be a waste of time and money, it does pain me to say that. But, if I'm taking the time to work out, I want an actual work out. Ellen is of course lovely as usual.
Ellen please do a real mat work out next time  with those great moves like the windsheild wiper and the pelvic tilt with the in and out thigh squeezes and more leg beats please.
I would only use this if I was sick, injured of hung over.",1391385600,5,841,4.25625
5687905,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I am always wondering if Ellen's workouts challenge me enough.

This is a perfect combination of stretching, strengthening, and working.  To quote Ellen, ""I was sweating.""  quite a lot.

A little bit on me, moderately fit, workout at the gym 2x a week in their super hardcore classes, and supplement at home.

This dvd is genius.  I would love to see more of this intensity and style of video please Ellen!!  Bring it on.

For those with knee/wrist problems.  This video may exacerbate some problems, but do not despair.  She teaches you how to cope, encouraging you to make modifications all the way.  Sometimes I have to make my fist into a ball and rest on my knuckles.  Sometimes, I have to use a pillow under my knees.

The end result is that I am worked out, stretched, lengthened, and feel really, really good.

Love it.",1390521600,18,827,4.575342465753424

5687909,5,B00C29Z3U4,"Being a owner of Ellen's others fusion workouts, I snapped at the chance to purchase this floor workout.

5687910,5,B00C29Z3U4,"I have a few of Ellen Barrett's workouts and they are all I use anymore.  She is easy to follow, her voice is pleasant and she keeps me going.  At first it seems like it's an easy workout, but before you know it,  you're sweating and breathing hard!  And by the next evening, I'm feeling it - so it's working all the spots I want to work on.  What could be better?  I alternate between Fusion Floor, The original Fusion workout and the Sculpt express workout - sorry I don't know the exact names right now - but after years of being unhappy with my legs -, I'm finally sticking with a workout and noticing how my jiggly thighs are becoming a thing of the past.  I'm 52 and feel better than I have in years.  I highly recommend this workout and any of Ellen's dvds.  She's the best as far as I'm concerned",1385337600,37,804,4.1688311688311686
5687911,4,B00C29Z3U4,"This is a really nice, end-of-the-day workout. I like being able to sit down and do lots of stretching, toning and lengthening. I don't think people realize how important flexibility and muscle toning is as you age. The yoga fusion poses are super deep muscle stretches and strengthening all at the same time. The abs/Pilates section is a great tummy toner and there are quite a bit of back, arms, and legs in there too.

The only reason I took off one star is because a couple of the poses are uncomfortable, even using a yoga mat. You may want extra cushioning under your knee during the leg lifts and circles. Putting all of your weight on one knee for such a long time does begin to hurt. Easy to modify though.

Love Ellen, all her videos are fantastic!",1383004800,6,758,4.446043165467626

I like doing Ellen's workouts for many reasons . . . music, something different, the balance challenges, the integrative approach, the wonderfully calming and healing effects . . .

So the Fusion Floor Workout I especially love because it's all on the floor.  For me, I love, love the stretching, the integrative effects and the balance challenges.
