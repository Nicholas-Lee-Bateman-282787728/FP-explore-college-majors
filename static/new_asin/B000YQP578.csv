3035107,5,B000YQP578,"Before going into the merits of the film itself, I must say something about the technical aspects, something I usually do not care about much. But in this case you must be aware, that the quality of both image and sound is rather POOR. This is a rather BAD TRANSFER from a clearly badly used copy - and therefore if quality of image and sound are very important to you, I would advise against buying it, as viewing it can be a frustrating experience.

That being said, I personally have spend a very good moment re-watching this old B-movie, which I watched only once before, AGES ago, on a black and white TV in communist Poland, when I was still a little boy. And I am very happy that I bought ""Fury of Achilles"" because, believe it or not, this is still the BEST film on Trojan war to be made yet. It is better than the old ""Helen of Troy"" and definitely better than the pathetic Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt.

The reasons why I consider this old B-movie as the best cinematographic adaptation of ""Iliad"" yet, are the following:

- ""Fury of Achilles"" respects greatly the original text of ""Iliad""; it begins in the 10th year of war and it ends with the scene in which Hector's body is ransomed; even the title is very well chosen, as indeed the ""Iliad"" begins with the mention of the wrath of Achilles

- as in ""Iliad"", in this film Trojan War is waged not only by mortals but also by gods; the immortals send omens and messages to their champions; they send them sometimes gifts to help them; they can hide them from the sight of their enemies; and they can even show their own terrifying wrath if they are gravely offended

- Achilles is presented here much better than in other films; he is not a snotty primadonna as in ""Helen of Troy"" and definitely not an emo/bipolar jerk as Brad Pitt portrayed him in ""Troy""; here he is a powerful warlord, respected, loved and feared by his Myrmidon troops; he certainly has a temper and pride as great as his physical strength - but he is definitely not a brainless brute, much to the contrary

- Gordon Mitchell, who plays Achilles, made an excellent job in this film and I think chosing him for this role was a very good decision; born as Charles A. Pendleton, as a young man he served in US Army in WWII and saw real combat up close and personal (he was wounded and taken prisoner in the Battle of Bulge); he later re-enlisted and served again with distinction during the Korean War; between the wars he went to college and became a high school teacher; because of his size (he was 6 feet 5 inches and build like a tank, even BEFORE going into body-building) and his quite threatening face he teached mostly the particularly difficult classes, composed of young delinquents; after the Korean War he became an adept of body-building and a stuntsman in Hollywood, before going to Italy where under the name Gordon Mitchell he played in more than one hundred of sword and sandal films and spaghetti westerns; ""Fury of Achilles"" was amongst his first films and it was definitely his greatest role ever; when he died at age of 80 in 2003, amongst those who came to his funeral was a certain Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time fan...

- also most of other main characters are present and described very faithfully to the original; Agamemnon, Odysseus, Priam, Chryzes and Andromache are good; Bryzeis, Patroclus and Hector are VERY good; there are only few clearly visible changes compared to ""Iliad"": Sarpedon watches the fight between Achilles and Hector from the walls of Troy instead of being earlier killed by Patroclus; Patroclus falls head over hills in love with a voluptous slave girl he captured and took to his bed earlier during war; Apollo punishes the Greeks by lightnings rather than plague, etc. But those are only minor changes - this film mostly sticks very faithfully to the ""Iliad""

- dialogs are suprisingly good! In most of those old Italian B-movies dialogs are very silly, sometimes borderline idiotic - but not here! Especially good is the scene when Achilles tames Brizeis, who initially is (understandingly) very much against having sex with a man who just one day before burned her city and brought her to his tent by force - it is definitely better than the ridiculous scene between Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne in ""Troy"". Relations between Agamemnon and Achilles are also an occasion to some pretty good scenes, as is the taunting of Hector by Achilles, to make him come out and fight...

- the climactic fight between Achilles and Hector is a very, VERY good (and long) scene - and I was really moved by it...

- last but not least, the overhelming weight of ""ananke"", the unescapable destiny, is omnipresent in this film, as it was in the original text; both Achilles and Hector know their fate in advance - but neither of them will run from it; one will boldly challenge the gods and try to change his destiny, the other one will walk towards his fate with his head up, laughing silently in gods faces...

So bottom line, even if five stars can seem a lot for an old, mostly forgotten Italian B-movie with a body-builder in the main role, I can not help it - I liked this film a lot, I spend a really good moment watching it and therefore I must give it the highest note (even if the quality of the image and sound really sucked). A recommended viewing. Enjoy!",1363824000,6,5344,4.55625
3035108,3,B000YQP578,The Movie itself is very good. The acting is not bad.

3035109,4,B000YQP578,"I do enjoy an epic, and as far as I am concerned, if it is ridiculous, with wooden acting and absurd stereotypical speeches, I like it the more. That is how I felt about this one from the moment I saw that dreadful picture on the front cover - a sort of line drawing, with a snarling Achilles and a depiction of Hector's corpse dragged behind the chariot - while, rather improbably for a corpse, he bends his arms and clenches his hands.

  It is intriguing; the script could be a far better, the acting is often absurd (the scene where the Greek warriors are stricken down by plague had me laughing outright) the soundtrack is dreadful, the dubbing botched, the colours peculiar, yet somehow, this film works as a depiction of 'The Iliad' far, far better than the lavish and pretentious, but ultimately empty 'Troy'.

  Also, while I found the 'Stockholm Syndrome' relationship between Achilles and Briseis as depicted in 'Troy' offensive - after all, that film was made in post-feminist times - ironically, I found the handling of Briseis' change of heart towards her captor in this film touching.

  I think this is because the film was made during a era when the attitude towards rape (and taking women captive as prospective sexual partners can only be rape) was different, being rather on the lines of: - 'All men will do it, it's their nature'.

  Achilles and Patrocles, as they leer at the women captives, aren't brutal or malicous, just insensitive; they really believe that all women will enjoy their inevitable surrender.

  Therefore, it is all the more shocking for Achilles when Briseis takes a knife to him.

  The fact that a prize warrior doesn't sense a coming attack is possibly accounted for by the fact that he cannot imagine a woman would have the nerve to make such an attempt on him, the greatest warrior of them all.

  There are some delightful tacky special effects in this scene, for the skin of Achilles' back cannot be penetrated, and the knife bends with a flash of sparks. Wonderful stuff!

 The following scene was one that could have gone badly wrong, particularly in an epic where wooden acting is the norm, but at this point,the acting, the script, and direction all come together in a flash of brilliance other than that caused by the sparks from the damaged knife.

 Achilles raves out threats: - 'Shall I have you tamed like a wild mare?...' But then, he goes on to reveal his lonliness and despair,and gradaully, Briseis melts. Somehow the actors are able to pull off a scene that could have seemed really distasteful if done wrongly, and impart real feeling to it.

  This is all the more intriguing, as Achilles in this is not, as he was in 'Troy' a arrogant mortal, but is half god, and this ironically serves to make him far more sympathetic, out of place as he is in this world, cut off from his peers by his peculiar abilities.

  In an early scene where he pursues Hector, there is something truly horrific about his inexorable hunt, and he says himself that in battle he becomes a 'killing mahine'.

  He is amiable when happy - as during a scene of games where he throws Patrocles' spear - and overall I think ex-body builder Gordon Mitchell succeeded in making a very believable Achilles for whom we feel real pity.

  For sure, he has muscles on his muscles which can only be the real thing (the photography was not sophisticated enough to deceive the eye much back in those days) and he somehow manages to be impressive even in an absurd, micro-mini red toga thing.

  It was a shame that the scriptwriter didn't utilise those wonderful words from 'The Iliad' in King Priam's plea to Achilles, 'I have endured what no man has before; I kiss the hands of the man who killed my son...' (spoken so well later by Peter O'Toole). Still, the meeting between Priam and his son's killer is moving.

 Overall, I was quite impressed with this version desite the technical drawbacks.",1308787200,5,3925,4.645348837209302
3035110,4,B000YQP578,"THE FURY OF ACHILLES  - the film for CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY
Opening: FADE IN:

The image of a bust Homer calls the muses to give him inspiration to tell the story. The nine muses are the daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, ruler of the gods.  ""O heavenly goddess, tell me of the many woes brought upon the Greeks by the wrath (anger) of Achilles.""

CUE ANNOUNCER: A narrator tells us that THE ILIAD of Homer begins outside the walls of Troy. ""For ten long years, the Greek army has vainly besieged the city, and if the Trojans have suffered under this relentless assault, the Greeks too feel the hardships of war.  Exhausted by many battles and short of supplies, the Greeks are camped on the coast where they live by ravaging the countryside. All the towns along the coast have been sacked, and now the Greeks are forced to look farther afield for plunder [A map shows that we are inland, away from the coast]. The expedition is marching against the city of Lynessos. It is led by Agamemnon, son of Atreus, King of Mycenaean Corinth, commander of all the Greek armies. With him is Ulysses [Odysseus] of Ithaka, wisest and most cunning of all Greek warriors.

""But stronger than all others is Achilles, King of Phthia, son of Peleus and Thetis [a minor goddess]. This famous hero has been made invulnerable by divine will. With Achilles is Patroclus, his best friend; they have fought together in a hundred battles. Before such an array of force [sic], the city of Lynessos is doomed.""

Thus begins a film that is surprisingly faithful to Homer's original THE ILIAD, much more so than bigger-budgeted films such as TROY and the 1956 HELEN OF TROY, directed by Robert Wise and featuring a stellar British cast.

Writing negative reviews of these low-budget, sword-and-sandal, Italian- made pec-taculars is like shooting fish in a barrel. Unfortunately, there is much to criticize: poorly dubbed dialogue, scratchy prints, washed out colors, ludicrous battle scenes, and plots that little to do with anything historical or mythological. These films still have their fans, and I don't mean only teachers of mythology and world literature like myself, but there are not enough of them to make something like a Trekkie fan convention profitable. They merely exist as remnants of a time -- late 1950s and early 1960s -- when these imports were flooding the drive-in and second-feature market.

Then along comes a little film like THE FURY OF ACHILLES which remains true to Homer's epic poem -- including attempts at reproducing the inflated poetic language, stilted though it is as presented by wooden actors. Only the much-longer, made-for-TV version of HELEN OF TROY tries to be as faithful to Homer, but this latter effort -- made cartoonish by the heavy handed use of CGI -- crashes like a computer.

The army gathers, waiting until Agamemnon gives the order to attack. The battle cry of Achilles is ""Phthia,"" echoed by his troops. But this Achilles is not a pretty boy like Brad Pitt; he is an ugly but muscular actor named Gordon Mitchell who looks as though he could bench press Volkswagens. Despite his horrible acting, or the inept dubbing of his voice, he has the presence to suggest an Olympian-type hero. He looks as though he could knock down a hoard of men, unlike Brad Pitt at the beginning of TROY who leaps into the air in slow-motion and plunges his sword down through the body of a giant pillar of a warrior who obliges him by standing still long enough to be slain.

After the capture of Lynessos the next morning, Patroclus and Achilles are oogling the women, particularly Zania [a blonde with the heavy eye make-up] and Briseis. Achilles says: ""That pretty little girl in the yellow dress [Briseis] already knows I'm thinking of her. When my turn comes, I'll choose her.""

When Patroclus says he wants her companion, Achilles says: ""Unfortunately, Agamemon has first choice. But we don't
have to worry about Ulysses. Who do you think that gold brazier will go to, for example?""

Patroclus: ""His wife needn't worry as long as there's gold. He'll be faithful to her."" What gold has to do with his being faithful to his wife, Penelope, is not made clear to me, nor is Achilles' next statement: ""And to Hermes, the god of thieves. But his greed does not displease me."" Patroclus says he sees what he means, but I don't.

The dialogue is like this throughout the film, particularly when Agamemnon starts spouting his lines, or when Hector, sometimes accompanied by soulful music, is speaking to the Trojans. ""Agamemnon, Ulysses, Achilles and Patroclus are away on an expedition. What are we waiting for? Without these leaders, the Greeks on the coast are completely lacking in authority, cunning, and strength.""

Hector knows that he ""shall die by the hand of Achilles. . . according to the oracle."" Paris, whose abduction of Helen caused the entire mess,  tries to say something but is cut off by the king. ""If I fear the king of Phthia, the invulnerable, it is only because my services are useful to my country. On the day of victory, Achilles can drive his lance through my body and throw me to the dogs, as he promised.""

This is what I mean by the poetic language. Unfortunately, we don't see Cassandra or Hecuba in this film, but neither did they appear in the mega-hit TROY.

Priam: ""At last, you all know what the oracle said. [Apollo's Oracle of Delphi, which, of course, predicts the future.] It's true, and it is terrible for me as a father."" And not too cheerful for Hector either.

Later Briseis discovers that Achilles' hide is magical when she tries to stab him with a dagger. She approaches him from the back as the music swells to indicate suspense. She stabs him in the back, but the dagger blade melts when it contacts his body. Sparks fly out. He is invulnerable except for one spot, but even he does not know where it is.

Achilles is enraged: ""Hector flees me. And a female from Lynessos dares so much?? What do you want me to do with you, break you in like a wild mare? Throw you into the arms of my warriors?""

The melting dagger is a good touch, as is a later scene when Minera materializes to stop him from killing the arrogant and rude Agamemnon. These scenes keep us in touch with the gods that are a necessary and important aspect of Homer's epic poem. Achilles tells Briseis that he is not invulnerable or immortal.

In one of the longer speeches in the film, he tells her: ""Even you could have killed me. The vagrant gods protect all of me . . . except one spot.  A fighting machine. . .created to destroy. . . and that also can be destroyed. . . when and where they [the gods] wish. As I said, you could have killed me. It is not necessary to be a hero. A child could have killed me. . . providing he struck me in the right spot.  I do not know where they fatal point is, but I know that I will not return alive from Troy. This the Oracle said before I left Greece - that Troy will only fall after the death of Hector - that Hector must be killed by Achilles, but that I Achilles will die after the death of Hector. Immediately after. Thus spoke the Oracle, Briseis. The other warriors have hopes of defending themselves against death. . . and surviving. . . to return home. But not I. Thus I ask of the wine as I ask of your beauty: the illusion of being a man like all the others. But when I drink too much wine, I behave like an animal. And you repulsed me, denying me the gift that out of pity you would give to the least of my warriors.""

Apollo, unlike Achilles' mother and Minerva, is never seen, but we do hear his echoing voice and see his powerful touch. Chryses is given his chance to deliver a powerful speech. With science-fiction music (a theramin) on the soundtrack to indicate that supernatural events are taking place. He says: ""Divine, Apollo, god of the Silver Bow, your priest has nothing more to ask of you. It is right that you abandon one not able to defend your sacred altar. But Apollo, as a father, I implore your assistance, father who must lament the unjust fate of his daughter, she who also, 0 god, offered you her many prayers and sacrifices and spirit of purest love.  [Thunder on the soundtrack] Apollo. Apollo. Chryseis is at the mercy of a pitiless enemy. Her youthful gentleness and her beauty - her very honor - is consecrated to you, has now become the pleasing of the Greeks as fate desires. Apollo, protect my daughter.  I beg you to hear the words of Chryses, your priest, and save my poor child.""

Apollo's voice echoes as if in an empty room to suggest his divine nature.  He tells him to go to the camp of the Greeks and lay wealth before King Agamemnon. When Chryses asks what wealth can he offer him, a lightning bolt splits open the altar stone. A vast treasure is revealed within it. Chryses examines the abundant wealth. Then, with the theramin music again in the background, a white chariot drawn by white horses materializes in the temple - a divine gift.

Throughout this film we find these minor gems of moments that one rarely finds in this genre. It a compact version of Homer, yes, but it delivers the basics of the story. For students stufying mythology and world literature, it is a good introduction. It is not overly graphic like TROY and is suitable for younger aged students. Even the inevitable, climactic man-to-man duel between Achilles and Hector is shown with its tragic as well as heroic aspects.

Despite the flaws in this DVD version -- and maybe a clearer one doesn't exist because no good negative remains -- I highly recommend it as an introduction to Greek mythology. The director wisely decided not to rewrite the ending of the story with Agamemnon and Menelaus being killed and Paris surviving to escape with Helen.

If I had the time in class, I would show this film and the 1956 version of HELEN OF TROY or THE TROJAN HORSE. Given only one choice, however, I would be tempted to lean toward this THE FURY OF ACHILLES. Check it out yourselves, mythology scholars and teachers, and see what you think.

The Italian film THE TROJAN HORSE with Steve Reeves as Aeneas and John Drew Barrymore chewing up the scenery as Ulysses begins almost where this one ends. THE FURY OF ACHILLES, like Homer's THE ILIAD, ends before the Trojan horse appears. It might not be as well-made as HELEN OF TROY, but it might make an interesting follow-up. Expose your students to the original story, which is, in itself, a Greek tragedy. And this is what the Greeks liked.",1203033600,19,10462,4.589496248660236
3035111,3,B000YQP578,"Peplum movies do not enjoy a great reputation in the world of movies today and unlike their sister genre the spaghetti western have not been the subject of major critical re-evaluation. Understandably ,as most are simply not very good being fun at best and painful at worst .The genre did give a start to luminaries like Mario Bava and Sergio Leone however and simply for this reason should be given a degree of respect
This movie-also known simply as Achilles -is a slightly above average example of the peplum .It follows The Iliad of Homer quite closely and starts as the Trojan war is nearing its end and before its most famous episode The Trojan Horse .Like Homer it raises the issue of divine intervention in the affairs of man

Gordon Mitchell -an actor in the Steve Reeves vein-plays Achilles and the French actor  Jacques Bergerac is his mortal enemy Hector .Mitchell looks ideal for the part-well muscled ,with a strong rather than conventionally handsome face, he is a considerable physical presence .Bergerac alas is a waste of space resembling several pounds of condemned veal in a skirt .

The movie has some decent battle scenes and limpid location photography ensures it  always looks good. The dubbing -into an ersatz American English-is execrable

It pales beside the lavishness of the recent Troy or the mid fifties Helen of Troy but Achilles/The Fury of Achilles is still a watchable sword and sandal mini-epic that is quite a soilid introduction to its subject",1195344000,12,1481,4.884462151394422

  This is all the more intriguing, as Achilles in this is not, as he was in 'Troy' a arrogant mortal, but is half god, and this ironically serves to make him far more sympathetic, out of place as he is in this world, cut off from his peers by his peculiar abilities.

  In an early scene where he pursues Hector, there is something truly horrific about his inexorable hunt, and he says himself that in battle he becomes a 'killing mahine'.

  He is amiable when happy - as during a scene of games where he throws Patrocles' spear - and overall I think ex-body builder Gordon Mitchell succeeded in making a very believable Achilles for whom we feel real pity.

  For sure, he has muscles on his muscles which can only be the real thing (the photography was not sophisticated enough to deceive the eye much back in those days) and he somehow manages to be impressive even in an absurd, micro-mini red toga thing.

  It was a shame that the scriptwriter didn't utilise those wonderful words from 'The Iliad' in King Priam's plea to Achilles, 'I have endured what no man has before; I kiss the hands of the man who killed my son...' (spoken so well later by Peter O'Toole). Still, the meeting between Priam and his son's killer is moving.

 Overall, I was quite impressed with this version desite the technical drawbacks.",1308787200,5,3925,4.645348837209302
3269607,4,B000YQP578,"THE FURY OF ACHILLES  - the film for CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY
Opening: FADE IN:

The image of a bust Homer calls the muses to give him inspiration to tell the story. The nine muses are the daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, ruler of the gods.  ""O heavenly goddess, tell me of the many woes brought upon the Greeks by the wrath (anger) of Achilles.""

CUE ANNOUNCER: A narrator tells us that THE ILIAD of Homer begins outside the walls of Troy. ""For ten long years, the Greek army has vainly besieged the city, and if the Trojans have suffered under this relentless assault, the Greeks too feel the hardships of war.  Exhausted by many battles and short of supplies, the Greeks are camped on the coast where they live by ravaging the countryside. All the towns along the coast have been sacked, and now the Greeks are forced to look farther afield for plunder [A map shows that we are inland, away from the coast]. The expedition is marching against the city of Lynessos. It is led by Agamemnon, son of Atreus, King of Mycenaean Corinth, commander of all the Greek armies. With him is Ulysses [Odysseus] of Ithaka, wisest and most cunning of all Greek warriors.

""But stronger than all others is Achilles, King of Phthia, son of Peleus and Thetis [a minor goddess]. This famous hero has been made invulnerable by divine will. With Achilles is Patroclus, his best friend; they have fought together in a hundred battles. Before such an array of force [sic], the city of Lynessos is doomed.""

Thus begins a film that is surprisingly faithful to Homer's original THE ILIAD, much more so than bigger-budgeted films such as TROY and the 1956 HELEN OF TROY, directed by Robert Wise and featuring a stellar British cast.

Writing negative reviews of these low-budget, sword-and-sandal, Italian- made pec-taculars is like shooting fish in a barrel. Unfortunately, there is much to criticize: poorly dubbed dialogue, scratchy prints, washed out colors, ludicrous battle scenes, and plots that little to do with anything historical or mythological. These films still have their fans, and I don't mean only teachers of mythology and world literature like myself, but there are not enough of them to make something like a Trekkie fan convention profitable. They merely exist as remnants of a time -- late 1950s and early 1960s -- when these imports were flooding the drive-in and second-feature market.

Then along comes a little film like THE FURY OF ACHILLES which remains true to Homer's epic poem -- including attempts at reproducing the inflated poetic language, stilted though it is as presented by wooden actors. Only the much-longer, made-for-TV version of HELEN OF TROY tries to be as faithful to Homer, but this latter effort -- made cartoonish by the heavy handed use of CGI -- crashes like a computer.

The army gathers, waiting until Agamemnon gives the order to attack. The battle cry of Achilles is ""Phthia,"" echoed by his troops. But this Achilles is not a pretty boy like Brad Pitt; he is an ugly but muscular actor named Gordon Mitchell who looks as though he could bench press Volkswagens. Despite his horrible acting, or the inept dubbing of his voice, he has the presence to suggest an Olympian-type hero. He looks as though he could knock down a hoard of men, unlike Brad Pitt at the beginning of TROY who leaps into the air in slow-motion and plunges his sword down through the body of a giant pillar of a warrior who obliges him by standing still long enough to be slain.

After the capture of Lynessos the next morning, Patroclus and Achilles are oogling the women, particularly Zania [a blonde with the heavy eye make-up] and Briseis. Achilles says: ""That pretty little girl in the yellow dress [Briseis] already knows I'm thinking of her. When my turn comes, I'll choose her.""

When Patroclus says he wants her companion, Achilles says: ""Unfortunately, Agamemon has first choice. But we don't
have to worry about Ulysses. Who do you think that gold brazier will go to, for example?""

Patroclus: ""His wife needn't worry as long as there's gold. He'll be faithful to her."" What gold has to do with his being faithful to his wife, Penelope, is not made clear to me, nor is Achilles' next statement: ""And to Hermes, the god of thieves. But his greed does not displease me."" Patroclus says he sees what he means, but I don't.

The dialogue is like this throughout the film, particularly when Agamemnon starts spouting his lines, or when Hector, sometimes accompanied by soulful music, is speaking to the Trojans. ""Agamemnon, Ulysses, Achilles and Patroclus are away on an expedition. What are we waiting for? Without these leaders, the Greeks on the coast are completely lacking in authority, cunning, and strength.""

Hector knows that he ""shall die by the hand of Achilles. . . according to the oracle."" Paris, whose abduction of Helen caused the entire mess,  tries to say something but is cut off by the king. ""If I fear the king of Phthia, the invulnerable, it is only because my services are useful to my country. On the day of victory, Achilles can drive his lance through my body and throw me to the dogs, as he promised.""

This is what I mean by the poetic language. Unfortunately, we don't see Cassandra or Hecuba in this film, but neither did they appear in the mega-hit TROY.

Priam: ""At last, you all know what the oracle said. [Apollo's Oracle of Delphi, which, of course, predicts the future.] It's true, and it is terrible for me as a father."" And not too cheerful for Hector either.

Later Briseis discovers that Achilles' hide is magical when she tries to stab him with a dagger. She approaches him from the back as the music swells to indicate suspense. She stabs him in the back, but the dagger blade melts when it contacts his body. Sparks fly out. He is invulnerable except for one spot, but even he does not know where it is.

Achilles is enraged: ""Hector flees me. And a female from Lynessos dares so much?? What do you want me to do with you, break you in like a wild mare? Throw you into the arms of my warriors?""

The melting dagger is a good touch, as is a later scene when Minera materializes to stop him from killing the arrogant and rude Agamemnon. These scenes keep us in touch with the gods that are a necessary and important aspect of Homer's epic poem. Achilles tells Briseis that he is not invulnerable or immortal.

In one of the longer speeches in the film, he tells her: ""Even you could have killed me. The vagrant gods protect all of me . . . except one spot.  A fighting machine. . .created to destroy. . . and that also can be destroyed. . . when and where they [the gods] wish. As I said, you could have killed me. It is not necessary to be a hero. A child could have killed me. . . providing he struck me in the right spot.  I do not know where they fatal point is, but I know that I will not return alive from Troy. This the Oracle said before I left Greece - that Troy will only fall after the death of Hector - that Hector must be killed by Achilles, but that I Achilles will die after the death of Hector. Immediately after. Thus spoke the Oracle, Briseis. The other warriors have hopes of defending themselves against death. . . and surviving. . . to return home. But not I. Thus I ask of the wine as I ask of your beauty: the illusion of being a man like all the others. But when I drink too much wine, I behave like an animal. And you repulsed me, denying me the gift that out of pity you would give to the least of my warriors.""

Apollo, unlike Achilles' mother and Minerva, is never seen, but we do hear his echoing voice and see his powerful touch. Chryses is given his chance to deliver a powerful speech. With science-fiction music (a theramin) on the soundtrack to indicate that supernatural events are taking place. He says: ""Divine, Apollo, god of the Silver Bow, your priest has nothing more to ask of you. It is right that you abandon one not able to defend your sacred altar. But Apollo, as a father, I implore your assistance, father who must lament the unjust fate of his daughter, she who also, 0 god, offered you her many prayers and sacrifices and spirit of purest love.  [Thunder on the soundtrack] Apollo. Apollo. Chryseis is at the mercy of a pitiless enemy. Her youthful gentleness and her beauty - her very honor - is consecrated to you, has now become the pleasing of the Greeks as fate desires. Apollo, protect my daughter.  I beg you to hear the words of Chryses, your priest, and save my poor child.""

Apollo's voice echoes as if in an empty room to suggest his divine nature.  He tells him to go to the camp of the Greeks and lay wealth before King Agamemnon. When Chryses asks what wealth can he offer him, a lightning bolt splits open the altar stone. A vast treasure is revealed within it. Chryses examines the abundant wealth. Then, with the theramin music again in the background, a white chariot drawn by white horses materializes in the temple - a divine gift.

Throughout this film we find these minor gems of moments that one rarely finds in this genre. It a compact version of Homer, yes, but it delivers the basics of the story. For students stufying mythology and world literature, it is a good introduction. It is not overly graphic like TROY and is suitable for younger aged students. Even the inevitable, climactic man-to-man duel between Achilles and Hector is shown with its tragic as well as heroic aspects.

Despite the flaws in this DVD version -- and maybe a clearer one doesn't exist because no good negative remains -- I highly recommend it as an introduction to Greek mythology. The director wisely decided not to rewrite the ending of the story with Agamemnon and Menelaus being killed and Paris surviving to escape with Helen.

If I had the time in class, I would show this film and the 1956 version of HELEN OF TROY or THE TROJAN HORSE. Given only one choice, however, I would be tempted to lean toward this THE FURY OF ACHILLES. Check it out yourselves, mythology scholars and teachers, and see what you think.

The Italian film THE TROJAN HORSE with Steve Reeves as Aeneas and John Drew Barrymore chewing up the scenery as Ulysses begins almost where this one ends. THE FURY OF ACHILLES, like Homer's THE ILIAD, ends before the Trojan horse appears. It might not be as well-made as HELEN OF TROY, but it might make an interesting follow-up. Expose your students to the original story, which is, in itself, a Greek tragedy. And this is what the Greeks liked.",1203033600,19,10462,4.589496248660236
3269608,3,B000YQP578,"Peplum movies do not enjoy a great reputation in the world of movies today and unlike their sister genre the spaghetti western have not been the subject of major critical re-evaluation. Understandably ,as most are simply not very good being fun at best and painful at worst .The genre did give a start to luminaries like Mario Bava and Sergio Leone however and simply for this reason should be given a degree of respect
This movie-also known simply as Achilles -is a slightly above average example of the peplum .It follows The Iliad of Homer quite closely and starts as the Trojan war is nearing its end and before its most famous episode The Trojan Horse .Like Homer it raises the issue of divine intervention in the affairs of man

Gordon Mitchell -an actor in the Steve Reeves vein-plays Achilles and the French actor  Jacques Bergerac is his mortal enemy Hector .Mitchell looks ideal for the part-well muscled ,with a strong rather than conventionally handsome face, he is a considerable physical presence .Bergerac alas is a waste of space resembling several pounds of condemned veal in a skirt .

The movie has some decent battle scenes and limpid location photography ensures it  always looks good. The dubbing -into an ersatz American English-is execrable

It pales beside the lavishness of the recent Troy or the mid fifties Helen of Troy but Achilles/The Fury of Achilles is still a watchable sword and sandal mini-epic that is quite a soilid introduction to its subject",1195344000,12,1481,4.884462151394422
