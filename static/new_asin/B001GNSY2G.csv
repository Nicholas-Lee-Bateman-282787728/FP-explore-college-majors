8306331,5,B001GNSY2G,I bought this for my great great great niece (who is just turning one) This child loves this show and of course she cannot tell me what it is about it that she loves but I just look at her face and watch her actions when it comes on. I have caught glimpses of it and it looks like fun. I believe it is directed toward an older child but the younger ones like it too. I think the new ones (if you can find them) are priced pretty high. I was lucky to find a used copy and it is just fine.,1379980800,,487,3.737864077669903
8306332,4,B001GNSY2G,"Loved this show (on behalf of my kids) when I would see it on Noggin/NickJR.  Slow paced, gentle, great for first thing in the morning or as a bedtime break.  Educational, life lessons, morality - but with humor and humility.

Unlike how it was shown on Noggin/NickJR, this DVD unfortunately (and unnecessarily) has Lucy's voice dubbed from the very mild english accent voice in the original into an american accent.  Broke the spell for me, and so it's ended up on the shelf unwatched.  Docking it one star for that (could have been spelled out in product description), but for someone who never saw the original I suppose it would make little difference.",1314316800,,656,4.769911504424779
8306333,5,B001GNSY2G,"This series is incredibly sweet and well written.  The stories are well told enough that an adult can sit through them multiple times without wanting to rip out their hair.  There is no stupid, pointless dialog between the characters or jokes that involve body humor, hitting, etc.  The pace of the shows are a normal speed, with no disjointed filming, jerky framing or action that seems to be on fast forward like so many children's shows today.  And the theme song is very catchy and actually good music.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this series and I don't mind letting her watch it.",1253923200,3,591,4.59047619047619
8306334,5,B001GNSY2G,"This is a great product, my son loves it. I was also please with the shipping, it arrived very fast.",1250553600,,100,4.05
8306335,5,B001GNSY2G,"My four year old son loves the first 64 Zoo Lane DVD so we got this one too.  He likes it just as much!  This is all he wants to watch right now. They are very good episodes and teach values in a fun way.
Episodes:
- Georgina the Giraffe
- The Juicy Fruit Tree
- The Elephant Bird
- Ronald and the Tic Tic Bird
- Molly and Nathalie
- The Jungle Clearing
- Beverly the Beaver
- Esmerelda the Snake

The show is on Noggin so you can check it out to make sure your child likes it first if you want.  It is a very cute show and we highly recommend this DVD.

The books are wonderful too.  We got four (4-for-3) and will get the other ones soon.",1232841600,6,640,3.8106060606060606
