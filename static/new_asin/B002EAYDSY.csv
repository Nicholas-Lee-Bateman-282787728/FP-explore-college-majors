8367380,5,B002EAYDSY,Convicts Four was released in 1962. It starred Ben Gazzara in a role as a guy who murders and goes to prison. Much plot is involved as he becomes accustomed to prison life. Fans of men in prison films will like this the most.,1484092800,,225,4.136363636363637

8367382,2,B002EAYDSY,"I just watched a block of prison movies on TCM & they were either OK or straight up sucked so when I got to Convicts 4, I really wasn't expecting all that much. Convicts 4 was the last movie on the block so I guess TCM saved the best for last. It was a pretty decent movie & I didn't know it was based on an autobiography until I read it on another site but I think that's what made it better then the others. It was based on an actual person & not just a prison movie",1432080000,,468,3.7857142857142856

8367385,5,B002EAYDSY,"Clsssic black & white film, with outstanding, well known actors. Filmed at Folsom Prison with Correctional Officer's, including myself, playing the role of convicts. Very nostalgic for me.",1366588800,,188,5.75
8367386,3,B002EAYDSY,"Convicts 4 should be a Frank Sinatra comedy with Dean, Sammy, and Joey along for the ride. Instead it is a serious film about prison life, and while it does have Sammy Davis Jr., the star is Ben Gazzara., and the film is really Convicts 1 since the main focus is Gazzara. The film was written by Academy award nominee Millard Kaufman (""Bad Day at Black Rock"" and ""Take the High Ground"") and this is the first and only one of his films he directed.  It is based on the true life story of John Resko who helped write the screenplay.

In addition to Gazzara and Davis, the film features a strong cast with Stuart Whitman, Ray Walston, and Timothy Carey, with brief cameos from Rod Steiger, Broderick Crawford, and Vincent Price.

Gazzara was nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (""Hysterical Blindess"") and received 3 Golden Globe nominations and 3 nominations for a Tony. He appeared in dozens of films and TV movies, and is perhaps best remembered for his TV series ""Run for Your Life"" (1965-8). I remember him best for his work with John Cassavetes in films like ""Husbands"" (1970) and ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" (1976).  Gazzara plays a man sentenced to life in prison.

Stuart Whitman gives one of his best performances in this film as a reform minded prison guard. Whitman made more than 100 films and was nominated for his role as a child molester in ""The Mark"" (1961), losing to Max Schell in ""Judgment at Nuremberg"". Whitman was often seen in westerns (e.g., ""The Comancheros"", ""Rio Conchos"", ""The White Buffalo"") or war films (e.g., ""Darby's Rangers"", ""The Longest Day""), but my favorite performance was in ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (1956) where he played a survivor of a plane crash who becomes the leader of a band of aggressive killer chimps.

Ray Walston is everyone's ""Favorite Martian"" (1963 - 6) and is best remembered for his comic roles in films such as ""Fast Times at Ridgmont Times"" (1982) and the TV series ""Picket Fences"" (for which he won 2 Emmys). He appeared in more than 100 films and TV shows between 1954 and 2001.

The 6'4"" Timothy Carey plays a childhood friend of Gazzara, and in fact, the two men were good friends and part of Cassavetes' group. Carey also appeared in ""Husbands"" and ""Killing of a Chinese Bookie"". Carey was often cast as a heavy, usually with psychotic overtones, and he often spoke while keeping his teeth clenched, which he does in this film. Carey's brief appearance is almost worth the price of admission alone.

Rod Steiger appears as a sadistic guard in only one brief scene. Steiger was nominated for 3 Oscars (""On the Waterfront"", ""The Pawnbroker"" and ""In the Heat of the Night"") and won once. Between 1950 and 2002 he made over 100 films and was active in TV as well.

Broderick Crawford also makes only a brief appearance, as a warden. Crawford is best remembered for his Oscar winning performance as Huey Long in ""All the King's Men"" (1949) and for his TV series ""Highway Patrol"" (1955-9).

While the film is interesting, Kaufman's direction is pedestrian, as one might expect from a first time director. Moreover, Gazzara is in almost every scene, and as good an actor as Gazzara was, that's a lot to carry in a 105 minute film. Joe Biroc is the cinematographer and he does his usual good job, although the camerawork is traditional. Biroc was an award winning cinematographer, responsible for films such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), ""Attack"" (1956), ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" (1964), ""Brian's Song"" (1971), and ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974).

As a prison life film, where the focus is on a character study,  I'm more inclined to ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962), and ""Shawshank Redemption"" (1994).",1280620800,5,3697,4.741433021806854
8367387,5,B002EAYDSY,This movie is a masterpiece of cinema. I used to watch it anytime it came on TV back in the 60's. Channel 9 in NY had a movie of the week where they would show a movie every day at 8:00 for a week.  My family and I Watched it every night. It's worth it.,1266537600,2,253,3.6
8367388,4,B002EAYDSY,"A very pleasant suprise from the Warner Archive Collection. The film is clean with no debris and age releated defects, however, there is one momentary glitch somewhere in the middle portion, but no big problem. Overall, all those who have waited for Convicts 4 to be released in DVD format should be satisfied. Assembly line packaging with no bonus material.",1254441600,,358,4.983333333333333
