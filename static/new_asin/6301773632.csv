356971,4,6301773632,I had heard the name of this string quartet for some years.  This was an interesting insight into the workings of the group.  It caused me to look further on the internet to learn even a bit more about them.  Good music.,1411430400,,220,4.190476190476191
356972,2,6301773632,"Not very good. They're great musicians for sure, but also prima donnas  and seemed snobbish also, not only with their fans, but also among themselves. They don't have much to do with each other even in other countries on tour. They split up and won't allow the others to get in touch with them by phone or telling them what hotel they stay at. You'd think that people that get paid enormous money to do what they LOVE to do, and live out your dream would be happy with life and each other....... but it seems not.
Didn't play any pieces I really liked so....not very good on any level in my book. Not very much happened or interesting things to talk about either, so It was a waste of time for me and couldn't finish it, though I did watch 80% of it until I had to just turn it off. Not very good in my book I'm sorry to say.",1406764800,,825,4.092592592592593
356973,5,6301773632,I bought this for my daughter prior to a chamber music festival that she was going to attend.  She enjoys it and has indicated that what she gleaned from it was useful for the music festival.,1402876800,2,191,4.305555555555555
356974,5,6301773632,"We hear the Guarneri String Quartet playing compositions by many classical composers in various cities, and even  hear comments from the four musicians about the experience of playing in one of the world's greatest string quartets.",1386028800,3,231,5.416666666666667
356975,4,6301773632,"This film documents a truly great colaboration of musicisans. Luckily most are still around and their students still speak glowingly of then, particularly from their Marlboro years.",1361145600,2,181,5.7407407407407405
356976,5,6301773632,"This is a really great documentary. It incorporates a good blend of playing, interviews and other footage and finishes with a knockout performance of the fourth movement of Beethoven's Op 59 No 3.",1317427200,5,196,4.96969696969697
356977,4,6301773632,"This documentary, from the 1980s, is a peek into the world of chamber music and, specifically, the great Guarneri Quartet, whose sound one critic likened to ""date nut bread and cream cheese.""  There's a lot of music here but also the process of four individuals who regularly left their families to play music all over the world for three decades.  Fascinating.",1292198400,5,361,4.901639344262295
356978,5,6301773632,"This film is fascinating on several levels. First, the viewer gets an inside look at a highly creative, extremely disciplined, classical music string quartet in rehearsal, in performance, traveling together, and at home with their families.

Second, we learn a great deal about the internal dynamics of a `team' with a mission - quality performance of a very demanding musical genre that requires cooperation, dedication, discipline, and the total love of what one is doing.

Third, we learn something about the nature of personal relationships, writ large, times four minimally, and more if one includes, as one must, the families of the musicians. We learn what relationships of High Fidelity require, their rewards, and their sometimes all too painful costs. In one particularly moving scene, for example, we see the pain in the face and body language, and hear it in the words, of violist Michael Tree  discussing his desire to play, sometimes, the violin rather than the viola in concert. He is speaking with fellow members Arnold Steinhardt and David Soyer. They do not seem to understand Tree's desire. And at least in the film, his desire goes unrealized. In another case, we hear the pleading of violinist Arnold Steinhardt that the quartet perform a piece of music he loves. His feelings are not shared, to say the least, by the other members of the quartet.

Finally, and unexpectedly for me at least, we learn something about democracy, that it is built solidly, unequivocally, and constitutionally on compromise. We learn that in a democracy one is required to speak his or her mind, to give his or her opinion, to argue his or her case, and be unconditionally prepared to lose, and not leave.

This story is not about a lonely artist in a garret. It is about  four men who have an overwhelming desire to do something that requires they cooperate with each other - even when it hurts, as it often does. And it is not all about pain. The music, oh the music! What exquisite music these men make together!",1123632000,15,2016,4.84593023255814
356979,4,6301773632,"Fans of the Guarneri Quartet will enjoy this chance to go behind the scenes for a glimpse into the world of this fine musical group.  However, anyone who loves classical music and has even an inkling of the time, commitment and struggle involved in playing it well will appreciate this film as well.  Rather than try to paint a cohesive and tidy picture of the Guarneri, director Allan Miller has wisely chosen to let them emerge as they are - four strong, highly opinionated individuals who are still in the process of evolving with the music they play.
The overriding question of the film, of course, is how has the Guarneri managed to stay together for so long?  Even the members themselves have no good answer to that one, but as the film follows each of them from home to rehearsals to airports and music halls, some recurring themes emerge.  There is humor and passion, and the satisfaction standing before a wildly clapping audience.  There is also something vibrant and challenging in the interactions between the four, even when they disagree.  Clearly part of what keeps the Guarneri together is the opportunity to discuss, interpret, and ultimately come to terms with superb music in the company of like minded, if occasionally cantankerous, colleagues.
If there is anything this film lacks, it's time.  The 85-minute running time simply isn't enough to do justice to these complex and enigmatic musicians.  You will arrive at the end wishing for more.  But in my book, that's a good thing. Encore!",1015113600,29,1509,4.86328125
356980,3,6301773632,"The Guarneri's cellist has now retired - the quartet is in a new phase and I'm sure they'll continue to evolve, in spite of a recent savage review in Strad.  They're one of our great quartets, and I recommend any of their recordings.
It's a very interesting video and I recommend it, but if its really representative of their lives together, I pity these guys.  They were together for 35+ years, and it appears to have been one long argument, due to communication mistakes that they just kept making over and over without ever trying something different, judging by the film.  Without commenting on David Solley's musicianship, I think the other three might have been happier with another cellist, one closer to them in age, experience, and communication style.",1014249600,4,761,4.883720930232558
357247,5,6301773632,"I particularly liked the way truly gifted musicians, though they may not completely agree during practice, come together as an harmonious ensemble in public.  What a treat to have had these guys in our midst for so many years!",1434412800,,226,4.794871794871795
357248,5,6301773632,"A wonderful, albeit historical look into one of the great string quartets, certainly with the longest single membership in the history of the string quartet (40 years before David Soyer retired).  The film documents them in only their 23rd year--it would have been great to see an update before the group finally retired a few years ago.
My only disappointment in the film is the video and audio quality, as it was made in a pre-hi-def era. But the group does live on in some very fine audio recordings",1433894400,2,502,4.640449438202247
357249,5,6301773632,Great and honest representation of married life in one of the most amazing string quartets of all time!,1432944000,,103,4.777777777777778
357250,2,6301773632,As an actor and writer I recognize the importance of rehearsal and working out the nuances of performance.  This quartet is a messy democracy.  No supreme leader. They work it out.  If I was acting I would do the required rehearsing.  I would submit to the necessity of a director (unless it was real-time improv).  I would not otherwise voluntarily attend a rehearsal to be entertained.  The music in this is in fragments throughout.  At least the closing piece could have been an intact scintillating performance of music without interruptions and voice-overs.,1430956800,3,562,5.043478260869565

357256,5,6301773632,"Despite the misleading name (""High Fidelity""??  As in vinyl lps?), this little gem of a film is a must-see for anybody in the classical music industry, and anybody who loves classical music.  As a classical musician myself, this film resonated with me on every level. Even people who do not work in the music industry, yet work closely with a small team, can relate to this documentary of a quartet of musicians who rehearse, travel, and perform together--for 23 years!  They were the longest-lived quartet in existence!  I am grateful someone out there appreciated the work of these fine musicians enough to document their work.  Too, the video of their rehearsals and performances is uber satisfying.",1419897600,2,702,5.017241379310345

7815072,4,6301773632,"From a musician's standpoint, the movie is a fascinating glimpse into the personas and discipline required to work in a professional string quartet.  However, the movie rather drags on and on.",1457222400,,192,5.193548387096774
7815073,2,6301773632,"An intimate view of what it is like to be part of a top notch professional string quartet. Good perspectives on the stress, thrill, and potential pitfalls (like interpersonal conflicts) that are an integral part. I especially enjoyed seeing how they resolved the issue when some members of the quartet wanted to play a piece while others did not. Quartet members everywhere should sympathize!

I was disappointed by the pervasive use of inappropriate language everywhere throughout. I was hoping it would be family friendly entertainment (children under 13 were watching it as well). Unfortunately this aspect ruined the whole documentary for me. I doubt I would ever watch it again.",1456531200,2,683,5.209090909090909
7815074,4,6301773632,"Since there is a paucity of any kind of classical music videos, this one is very interesting to anyone who treasures chamber music and string quartets.  The Juilliard Quartet was always one of the world's greatest and this movie/video gives an inside view into the complicated workings of a group of four superb musicians and how they come to conclusions about the finished product.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the quality is not what we are used to, but quite good.",1455580800,,478,4.6117647058823525
