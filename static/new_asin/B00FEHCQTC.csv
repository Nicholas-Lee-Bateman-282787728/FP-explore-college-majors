8614793,5,B00FEHCQTC,"In my quest to see every last Roberta Findlay movie before I die, I was delighted to nail this viewing of 'Lurkers' down at last. Not a moment of disappointment was had, and I even liked the 'Die Sister, Die!' (2nd feature) film, though nothing is gonna come close to anything Lady Findlay put her finger to, you know that.

Roberta knew how to work a New York city street (NO! Not like that, I mean with a camera...) for all it was worth, every squalid angle seemed to jump into the capturing range of her lens, and for that I will continue to search out as many of her unique approaches to the cinema canon that I can find.

Someday in the not so distant future I envision a Roberta Findlay exhibit in a fine arts gallery, where former disbelievers will be treated to a steaming dish of roasted crow with a side of prunes and horseradish.

Amazon provides it, and it was presented by Scorpion Releasing who do not skimp on the production when they put together a DVD package. My gratitude is at your beck and call, folks!",1506384000,,1023,4.345549738219895

8614795,2,B00FEHCQTC,"Die Sister Die is just an ok 70's murder mystery with a made for tv feel aka NO GORE , and you will see the ""twist"" coming from a mile away. Lurkers is total crap. So save your money.",1469404800,,183,3.717948717948718

8614797,2,B00FEHCQTC,"Die Sister, Die is more of a plodding drama that's going to put you to sleep.  Lurkers is interesting only because it's total nonsense.  Parts of it are funny, parts of it are boring/WTF, but ultimately it's an exercise in bad filmmaking.  It's not quite so bad it's good territory.  By the same director of Blood Sisters and on the same sub-par level.  But it has its moments, though they are few.  It's hard to justify spending more than 12 bucks for it, though.",1395619200,5,464,4.464285714285714
8614798,2,B00FEHCQTC,"Definitely lower-tier horror from the 70's & 80's. Nothing special about either film, but I've seen a lot worse. But don't take that as an endorsement.",1390867200,2,151,4.846153846153846
8614799,1,B00FEHCQTC,"Lurkers is a typical horror movie that does not make alot of sense. I was expecting a better movie. Its got some good special effects. It did not capture my full attention.
Die sister die should not be in this movie combo because its more of a murder mystery not horror. The movie is good better than Lurkers but its not what I am interested in watching.",1390694400,,354,4.298507462686567
