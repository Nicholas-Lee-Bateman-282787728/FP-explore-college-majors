4295359,5,B0049Y6I7C,"The French make some amazing movies. Some of my favorites have been Brotherhood of the Wolf, High Tension, Inside and Martyrs (the last one is not for the timid). The Horde lives up to my expectation of over-the-top French Zombie violence. It is what Zombie Land should have been if American filmmakers had any guts. The Horde is a bit slow in parts, but the Zombie mayhem is pure poetry to watch.",1293753600,,397,4.527777777777778
4295360,4,B0049Y6I7C,"Zombie movies are popping up these days more rapidly then their shambling undead subjects and with the success of AMC's 'THE WALKING DEAD', titles from other countries are beginning to filter in the mix.  This one from France, Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher's 'THE HORDE' has the frenetic energy of their slasher film genre mixed with the kinetic energy of Zach Snyder's remake of George Romero's classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'.  Nothing is explained as the newly deceased are rising and creating havoc but before this all happens , we are introduced to a sub plot of vengeance between underground police and Nigerian thugs.  Trapped in a rundown high rise building, both parties must pool their resources and struggle to survive while our gut munchers relentlessly attack in some excellently, gory set pieces.  African actor Eriq Ebouaney as the head of the thugs and french actress Aurelien Recoing steal the film with brilliant acting for this type of movie and the gore is piled on high and steady.  I had some problems midway through the films running time but things pick up as our heroes(?) make their way out of the building complex.  Fans of the undead should check this one out just for its sheer audacity alone. IFC has a beautiful 2.35 transfer in French with English subtitles and extras include a short film by the filmmakers, an alternate opening sequence and deleted scenes both of which should have been included in the final cut. Along with another french Zombie variation released this year from IFC ,'MUTANTS', France is quickly becoming the new source to check out for great Horror entertainment.",1293321600,9,1616,4.922794117647059
4295361,4,B0049Y6I7C,"Europe has spent the past decade on one hell of a horror film tear.  It's quite the pity so few people have noticed.  France's latest entry to the genre is an adrenaline rush that brings to mind testosterone-fests like Dog Soldiers and the video game Left 4 Dead.  Bet you didn't know France kicked this much rear.  In ""The Horde"", a group of police officers mourning the violent death of a comrade suit up for a little off-the-clock justice aimed in the direction of the copkiller at large.  The vigilantes storm the gang's hideout in a dilapidated high rise and let's just say that nobody is getting quite what they bargained for tonight.

Zombie apocalypse in 3.... 2.... 1....

Time to kick some undead rear.  A nightmarish reject from Silent Hill storms into the room and after taking an NYPD-worthy barrage of lead without dropping, flanked by the cries of his infected brethren making their way to the buffet, all parties are sufficiently convinced it's going to be a long night.  Their business unfinished, cops and robbers must join forces to try and hold off the sudden surge on the zombie meter.  What follows is a visceral action film that pushes all the right macho buttons and hits all the right dramatic spots.

Without adding anything new to the genre at all, The Horde outdoes about every zombie film you can name in sheer a$zkickery.  Like I said, the best comparisons are to Dog Soldiers and Left 4 Dead;  the film that made werewolves awesome again, and the video game that made zombies terrifying again.  And these are possibly the scariest zombies you've see for some time, resembling the infected of ""28 Days Later"" on PCP.  Perhaps even scarier than the ravening undead cannibals are the ""heroes"" of this piece.  The hand-to-hand combat in this film is BRUTAL.  You will almost certainly flinch and even feel bad for some of the zombies.  These folks do not mess around.  Except to shoot the legs out from under a female zombie and tease her by commanding her to french kiss a severed head they're holding in front of her.  Yeah, these guys are pretty effed up.  But in a good way.  Sort of.

The visuals in this flick are very nice, the characters are easy to cheer for in spite of how twisted they are, the violence is delightful, and the action seldom lets up.  Why are zombies invading, again?  Who knows?  Who cares?  This is all about the characters' struggle to make it out of a single building into a larger world where God knows what is waiting for them?  I'm betting more zombies, but I love the notion that the point of the entire film is to accomplish what would normally be the most simple and mundane of objectives.  Magnifique.

Surprisingly, this bit of low budget awesome brought to us by our friends at IFC comes packed with special features.  Trailers, deleted scenes, a making-of, an alternate opening,  and even an action-packed short film prequel to the feature presentation are on the DVD in addition to other odds and ends.  The Horde is a film worthy of cult classic status in spite of it's lack of narrative creativity, and it would have revered status like Dog Soldiers if it weren't being released in the middle of our current glut of zombie-mania.  Nonetheless, this is a low budget action-horror flick that plays like a bloody big-budget extravaganza and if subtitles don't offend thine eyes, then you've got to check this puppy out.",1292976000,4,3387,4.675126903553299
4295362,4,B0049Y6I7C,Always on the lookout for a quality zombie flick with good production values and this french flick was a positive surprise.,1292889600,,123,4.904761904761905
4295363,3,B0049Y6I7C,"This item is misleading. It states that it is the ""Uncut International Version"" but it's actually the same version you can get anywhere else. This version is just under 93 minutes long and is missing the scenes (cemetery scenes and Jimenez beating up a guy in an alley) in the beginning of the movie which are part of the real uncut version.

EDIT: Though my comments above are true (This is not the 101 minute UNCUT version) I would like to comment on the item besides this point. As far as picture quality, packaging, and features this DVD is great. My one and only problem was I thought I was getting the longer version.",1291161600,2,623,4.464912280701754
4295364,3,B0049Y6I7C,"A group of police detectives enter a housing complex located in the north of Paris. Their target is a Nigerian drug dealer and his brother, who they know are responsible for the death of their colleague. Their off-the-record raid goes terribly wrong when the gangsters and their henchmen fight back. Not only that; believe me nor not, the attack of a horde of flesh hungry zombies begin at the same time!

The film mostly keeps a good pace, with generally fine acting from the cast and clever use of the run-down facilities as the film's location. The storyline about the two conflicting groups trapped in one place, which reminds us of ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" is unique, but it could have been more interesting with a tighter, more focused narrative

For, though the film is entertaining with lots of gore and all, it sometimes - just sometimes - lacks suspense, not knowing what to emphasize. Certain part of the film clearly reflects some of the social and political issues today, most notably immigrants and gender, but perhaps the director team Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher should have put more emphasis on the survival story or the battles with the zombies.

4295367,4,B0049Y6I7C,"The Horde (2009)
 This French Zombie flick is one of the most brutal, blood drenched and intense Zombie movies made to date.  The movie is professionally done in a true horror style that is both compelling and off putting.  I was mesmerized.  There are long, complex and very effective sequences of combat with Zombies that often end in hand to hand combat with any handy weapon or even bare hands.  These Zombies bleed when you smash them with something or blow their head off.
 A band of French police head to a part of Paris that civilization has abandoned in order to find and murder a crime lord that had previously slain one of their number.  No arrests contemplated.  They are in any case ambushed by the more vicious than thou criminals just as the Zombie apocalypse begins.  Surviving cops and crooks combine in the interests of safety and begin a long deadly fight and flight from the nearly abandoned high rise slum where the crooks have their lair.
 The Horde is not for the squeamish.  The characterizations of the humans are vivid, realistic and true to form for a certain murderous slice of society.  This non rated (R would be a good choice for violence and gore, lots of swearing, one brief shot of Zombie tits) flick lasts one hour and 36 minutes.  I give it a strong three and a half brains for realism, action, good Zombie makeup (lots of blood) and manic intensity.  Whew.

4295375,1,B0049Y6I7C,"*Warning, may contain minor spoilers* Holy cow...where to start? Ok, we'll start with this one: The 'action' scenes in this movie make your typical 'Rambo' movie look realistic. As in, the movie 'Platoon' realistic. These guys have guns with magazines that hold roughly 113,000 rounds apiece...and if you think I'm exaggerating, just watch it. Just...watch it. And our heroes aren't the brightest bulbs in the package, either. Throughout the entire movie, the ENTIRE movie, they never, ever EVER catch on that a simple head shot will put a zombie down for good. But hey, it will work on a live person! No, instead, they'll get into a fist fight with one (I wish I was making this up), punch it about 5000 times, then, when that doesn't work, will grab their guns and shoot it in the chest about 5000 times, and then, FINALLY, they....whatever, it's not even worth the effort to type. And this one scene near the end of the movie, seriously, this guy was literally surrounded by, like, 500 zombies, out in the OPEN, and managed to fight them off for 10 or 15 minutes (I wish I was making that up, too), even after finally running out of ammo. You know, after he had fired all 113,000 rounds. And all the things I've pointed out, are just the tip of the iceberg. Complete TRASH, avoid at all costs.",1381276800,,1296,4.5905172413793105
4295376,4,B0049Y6I7C,"The Horde is a zombie film taking place entirely in a tenement complex, featuring a team of cops who enter on a revenge movie against a crime boss and end up on the same side against a zombie outbreak. So, yes, think The Raid or Dredd with zombies, only this one came out first.

The Horde gets off to a pretty average start. I was putting it at just around average as a zombie film for most of the movie. The story and pacing are what you've come to expect from zombie films if you've seen just a handful, and there was some DISASTROUS quick-cut editing and shaky camerawork done to the action scenes that pretty much totally robs them of any terror or adrenaline.

The effects for wounds and injuries were good, but the zombie makeup wasn't as hot as it could have been. Fortunately, this is a dark movie both thematically and literally -- most of the lights in the tenement are out and create a very shadowy atmosphere. It hides some lackluster makeup and, if the editing had been better when the zombies showed up, could have made for some seriously creepy moments with the undead.

The characters, all but one of whom are unhappy people, were written very well though, and the forced truce they find themselves under didn't strain believability -- whatever else was going on, these were people ready to kill each other when they didn't need each other to kill zombies anymore. While the overall story wasn't stellar, the acting and dialogue were done extremely well, which is one of the biggest things to getting a zombie movie right. So, I began to move just slightly above average for this as the movie went on.

It began to move even higher when they introduced the fact that the undead in this movie like to relocate corpses and body parts. I wish they would have played with this some more, but what's here is still enough to be unnerving and to separate The Horde from a sea of sameness of zombie films.

But what brought it from a solid 3 stars into 4 stars for me was the last thirty minutes. The movie goes out on a high note with quite literally all guns blazing. I won't ruin anything but there is one INCREDIBLE shootout against the undead in a parking garage and another great moment with a chaingun. And, in the end, the underlying conflict between the two groups is given good closure.

It's not going to go down as an all time classic, but The Horde is solid zombie material for fans of the genre. It also has a few things to make it all its own and make it more than just another face in the crowd of character driven zombie flicks.",1379980800,,2554,4.411889596602973

Cops that were way less than effective in planning and executing a plan of their own and then finding in the end the very terrorist they were bent on taking out didn't have any sense either gave me a good laugh. I had some hope the old codger was going to teach them some survival tricks but in the end he failed to pull the pin/s when he needed to and just bought the farm with the rest. my guess is the crazy chick had more nutz than all the rest. you go girl. pretty decent Zombie Flick; I enjoyed it more than most.,1379116800,,765,4.175675675675675

4295382,4,B0049Y6I7C,"This movie was one hell of a scary ride. Its brutal, very dark, grim, bloody as hell and filled with some of the nastiest and most unsetlling zombies ever put on film. The cast were all superb, creating performances that are so good that at times they surpass those of any performance to date in a zombie movie. The characters are all brutal human beings. Most of them are just plain mean and nasty as possible, and so when they meet their demise we don't feel all that sorry for them. Truly there arr no real heroes in this movie. The cops are brutal. The gangsters are even more inhuman. But there are moments when some of them show that they do have some sense of humanity. The production values are superb. The blood, gore and all other special effects are stellar. And there are some truly astonising and classic moments in this movie. If you are looking for a zombie movie that is simply hateful, mean and downright nasty, then this is the one for you. If you want zombies that are as scary as they can get then you will be satisfied. These zombies are simply creepy as I have ever seen zombies get.

4295384,1,B0049Y6I7C,"This zombie flick came quite highly recommended. However, I found it to be one of the more annoying zombie flicks in recent years. All in all, it just tried too hard. To start with, it took a good half of the film for the characters to work out that headshots are the only way to go. NONE of the characters were particularly likable because they ALL did something stupid/antagonistic/downright contrary to LOGIC! Not to mention the completely stupid persistence of PoliceVSGang tension. FFS! You are LITERALLY fighting for your lives. GET  OVER  YOURSELF! Totally frustrating zombie flick.

Directors Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher send us on a relentless roller coaster ride of non-stop action and bloody horror in THE HORDE! While the film brings nothing new to the table, the comic book characters play strongly into their respective archetypes, and the endless barrage of bullets keeps things moving at an electric pace. Eriq Ebouaney and Jean-Pierre Martins face off as the two high-powered rivals, along with a highly-entertaining performance by Yves Pignot as the crazed old Ren. The special effects are handled very well, with terrifying zombie designs and explosive splatter abound. There is also a tinge of dark humor that propels the characters and lightens the mood. Action/Horror fans of films like HOUSE OF THE DEAD and RESIDENT EVIL are sure to enjoy THE HORDE.

There is a english audio version on this one and a french one too.  This is a gory film and a tribute to the over the top shoot em ups of the past. That's why there's alot of zombie versus human fighting in this one! And one character never seems to be able to shoot the heads of the zombies much. These are running zombies and they look nasty.

4295396,4,B0049Y6I7C,"This isn't the first time we've reviewed the import zombie gangster film known as The Horde (La Horde pre-import) by directors Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher. I have a feeling it's not going to be the last either as I have this sneaking suspicion that every reviewer on the site will want a shot at it when they watch it just to stress how great this film is. The screenplay itself was split up on writing between 5 writers (Arnaud Bordas, Yannick Dahan, Stphane Mossakis, Benjamin Rocher, and Nicolas Peufaillit) who all did an amazing job putting the piece together. What we get is a solid film about love, revenge, gangsters, and zombies.

We see the film starting with one man who has been brutally murdered. His friends and lover vow they are going to have revenge on the gangster who was responsible for killing him as there doesn't appear to be another way to currently bring him the justice he properly deserves. Yes murder by cop, the only way to deal with gangsters in France apparently. The plan though goes terribly wrong and the cops are caught and in the case of a couple of them killed right off the bat. Right before the rest are executed for bothering this gangster's night though someone they had killed previously turned out to not be quite dead after all.

It takes the entire group of gangsters to take him down and they lose a couple in the process. The new plan, once they realize that there are more, is to combine forces with the cops as these aren't a stupid set of crooks - at least their leader isn't.

What happens following this is an all out use of guns, axes, and whatever they can get their hands on to rip through the zombie horde that is in the building to try to get to safety. Mix in an insane ex-soldier who happens to have some spare weapons from his days in 'the war' and you've got a great mix of people who can't trust each other past surviving the undead outbreak. While some of the introduction may start off slow don't let this fool you as zombies are constantly thrown into the mix and the characters get little to no downtime to try and recover. Action is intense and ongoing which is a perfect mix of what should happen when you mix running zombies (sorry slow loving zombies) and the enclosed area of a giant apartment building.

You really get sucked in and I don't know if it was the great acting (the subbed version was better but I skimmed the dubbed version and it's pretty spot on), the pace, or the special effects but the film came together perfectly and was 110% fun to watch!",1349049600,,2537,4.437768240343348

When they storm the building to take him down, the group ends up being captured. Thing is, both sides end up being confronted by an even deadlier enemy as a zombie apocolypse happens. So, both sides have to work together to make it out of the horror alive.

Have to agree with the editorial reviewer here at Amazon. Fans of Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days/Weeks Later ain't seen it all til they see The Horde. While it pretty much has everything you'd see in a zombie movie, it adds in plenty of action and alot of character. I know you're probably saying to yourself that you can get that in any Resident Evil movie. Yeah....but not like this. You have to hand it to Director Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher. Their visual style for this zombie movie is what makes this movie so great. Personally, I loved the movie. I never cared too much for the ending, though.

My biggest gripe with the movie is the fact that it is so great a zombie movie yet, even so, it feels as though I've been through this before. Sure, it does a thing or two new but I still felt that way coming away from the movie and that bothered me.

I do recommend The Horde to all you zombie fanatics out there. It may not be the greatest zombie flick ever made nor it may not rank amongst the all-time greatest zombie flicks ever but it does deserve to be seen by all zombie movie fans. At least, once.",1344556800,,1595,4.240131578947368
4295401,3,B0049Y6I7C,"""The Horde"" is a French zombie movie with English subtitles, which didn't take too much away from the movie since it really didn't seem to be relying on the dialog too much. I am a fan of all things zombie related so likely rated this higher than it should be, but it did have it's fair share of zombies, action, and even some really creepy moments. Where the movie was a bit of a let down was in the choice and development of the characters since there wasn't a single one that I cared about or was hopeful that they would survive.

No plot spoilers from me: This is a an escape movie set in a dilapidated apartment building that is home to a group of criminals and being raided by the police. The Zombie Apocalypses breaks out right at that exact time, but the cause is not given or even hinted at. The two sides have to work together to survive, but obviously neither side likes the idea very much. There is a claustrophobic setting, a lot of gore, a little nudity, and some shaky camera work to set the mood. This could have been a very good zombie movie but, as noted above, the characters were all so unlikeable that at some point I started hopping they would all die off quickly.

This can now be checked off my list of zombie movies to watch and doubt I will want to see it again.

4295402,4,B0049Y6I7C,"The zombies in this movie are, in a word, bad ass.

I love zombie movies, so I tend to be pretty forgiving with bad scripts and plot holes you can drive an 18 wheeler through.  And, while I didn't mind that the origin of the zeds is never explained, meh, who cares, this wasn't really about that anyway.  What I do care about is that we are given a group of people thrown into a situation where they have to work together to survive or die trying.  I really want a reason to care about those people, and what I need in order for that to happen, is a little teeny, tiny bit of what we call character development... back story, if you will.  Any little bit of story telling will do.  For example, we have a group of cops going into a semi- abandoned building to take revenge on one of their own, part of their family.  A pretty inept, seemingly untrained bunch of cops, making really stupid mistakes.  I mean, seriously, no wonder the very first idiot got himself killed (offscreen, prior to the beginning of the movie).  Story element part two, we have savage, nasty thugs, that right away are shown to be conscienceless killers, willing to kill for kicks.  Mix these two elements together, add zombies, shake, add a couple of zany random characters and throw in LOADS of gore, buckets of blood, a tiny pinch of angst (not too much, don't want to confuse the audience), throw in a bunch of raw meat, some silly heroics, some perverted weirdness just to make it seem surreal, a touch of thrilling heroics, and a very Gallic ending, and POOF!  Flat souffle.  It should have worked, it should have been awesome!  But, I just didn't care about the characters.  They were flat and 2D.  I didn't have enough information about them to really care about them.  A bunch of people go into a building.  They fight.  Then, they find zombies.  They fight zombies.  Some of them don't make it.  Some of them do.  The end.  (More or less).

This bit may contain a few minor spoilers.  We don't really find out much about our characters beyond some random facts about them being ""family"".  What, are they mob cops?  That is never really made clear.  So, it's kind of hard to really work up much of an ""I give a crap"" about any of the main characters, except for maybe Quess, and even he is at best a sympathetic character, but not really a very likeable character, at first.  They are going after our ""bad guys"" for revenge, for killing one of their brothers in arms.  That's kind of all we know.  Except, after encountering their first bungle, we assume that their fellow officer is a (sorry, *was* a complete dumb ass and probably deserved to get himself killed for not going up against the bad guys without backup).  Oh, and that they are going into a semi-condemned building with only a few tenants.  And, that the bad guys are really bad ass.  The thug brothers are Nigerian and have some issues.  And, when I say issues, I mean, ""ISSUES""  as in deep, meaningful, family fubar, years of therapy ""issues"".  We never really find out anything about their issues, besides that they have them.  They hang out with some creepy Eastern European circus guy.  Oh, and a couple of red shirts.  Rene was actually one of the most endearing characters in the movie (because you find out more about him and his back story than any other of the characters in the film), even tho he's a pervert.",1342483200,,3367,4.464696223316913

4295404,2,B0049Y6I7C,"I rented The Horde on Amazon Instant Video because I always do that with foreign material that has not seen wide or limited release here in the US. My review is based on the merits of the movie itself, not the dvd package and what it contains.

THE GOOD: There are the seeds of what could have been a truly great horror film. There is also lots of action and some humor that should entertain on various levels.

THE BAD:  A deeply flawed and underdeveloped script. Confusing direction. Terribly weak characters. To me, those three - script, direction, characters - are the key elements that can make or break any film.

Watching the trailer and reading all the reviews and high ratings here got me excited about this film. I love zombies. I love slow shambling zombies. I love fast hyper agressive zombies. I love all types of zombies. But what I especially love, are well developed zombie stories. This however, is not one. All these reviews are so misleading as to the merits of the film. Below I will explain my problems with the film. I'll include some spoilers.

A group of truly dumb cops, who act more like Mafiosi wannabes, decide to get revenge on a low level criminal hiding in an abandoned high-rise building who killed one of their own in some unseen episode prior to the beginning of the film. These dummies show no police training or discipline whatsoever and instead bicker constantly about family issues. These are supposed to be the good guys by the way. These are the ones we the audience are supposed to root for. I'm all for revenge stories, but the people taking revenge should at least be smart. These people are not. I didn't root for them. And you probably won't either.

Now, the criminals. There are a bunch of them. Just as dumb as the cops and pretty much faceless and nameless, except for three main ones. Two Nigerian brothers with deep emotional issues. I could see a good indie drama film in there, but of course this is a zombie movie so who cares about exploring their emotional issues. And some creepy looking dude from somewhere in Europe. There are also two people who live in the building, the super/caretaker who is another dummy, and this old crazy perverted veteran of some Southeast Asian war.

All these dummies start shooting at each other right away because it seems they have a need for bloodshed. One of the cops says they came for a bloodbath. The blood starts gushing right away from even the tiniest scratch. They should have replaced zombies with vampires and the story would have made more sense. In fact, the zombies seem more like vampires. They are so hyper agressive and difficult to kill that they make the zombies from Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead remake seem slow by comparison. They also have the ability to reason to some extent because they don't just eat the people they attack. They take the bodies and stash them away for later meals.

This is all sort of funny because without any heroes to identify with and root for, you are left with little to do but laugh at how dumb these people are. They are armed to the teeth, but they waste their bullets shooting in every direction expect the zombies' heads. Even if they have never seen zombie movies, everyone knows that if you shoot someone, anyone, living or undead, in the head they will go down. These ""hardcore"" criminals and vengeful cops are the only ones who don't know that apparently. On top of that they waste precious escape time using martial arts on the hyper agressive vampire zombies.

Then, comes a scene that is so deeply disturbing that you wonder about the mindset of the writers/directors of the film. A woman zombie shows up and runs to attack them. They shoot her legs to keep from coming at them. Then, the younger Nigerian brother, the creepy looking dude and the old perverted veteran taunt her with sexual insults and threaten to rape her. This goes on for quite a while. After the older Nigerian brother shoots her in the head to stop the show, the old perv undresses her to show what a nice body she has. What was the point of this? Why was there a need for this? It's really unsettling that the writers felt the need to insert a scene where the survivors try to sexually humiliate a zombie. I'm not opposed to scenes of such difficult nature, but they should make sense within the context of the story. Like the sexual brutality that takes place in The Divide. It makes sense in that story. It this story it just seems disturbing on the part of the writers.

Overall, with its premise of a group of survivors trapped inside a high-rise fighting off a zombie horde, the film had the potential to be good, but bad script and direction didn't help. And even though the actors are decent, their characters are so weakly written that the film just doesn't have much to offer. Unless your thing is dummy characters who can't shoot zombies in the head and try to molest them. I didn't hate it, but I cannot give it more than 2 stars. Hopefully, someone can remake this properly. I doubt it, but it could be a truly classic horror film if done right.",1338768000,4,5086,4.548633879781421

There is a good deal of suspense. Some REALLY hard to kill Zombies, the movie makers even included a half mad old French Indochina war veteran in the movie who performed ADMIRABLY. Everyone in the cast did quite well. In addition to the suspense there was indeed a good deal of ""horror"" to be found as well as a body count that is way too high to put a number on.
The Zombies are the ""new"" hyperactive type and not the stumblers of old.....and there certainly are a tremendous,even endless number of them.

Another example of the ""the less press a French horror flick gets in America, the better it is likely to be"" syndrome, <em>La Horde</em> has all the hallmarks of a classic zombie flick, doesn't try to do anything too terribly stupid, and actually has halway-decent production values. While on the other hand, there's not a bit of originality to be found here, it's still a watchable little flick that may well have passed under your radar.

Plot: Rivoallan (Laurent Segall in his only screen appearance to date), an undercover cop, has been found out by the gang he runs with, and his friends have to go into one of France's most decrepit project buildings to get revenge for him--Aurore (<em>Amelie</em>'s Claude Perron), Ouessem (<em>La Vie en Rose</em>'s Jean-Pierre Martins), Jimenez (<em>13 Tzameti</em>'s Aurelien Recogin), and Tony (<em>Le Chambre de Morts</em>' Antoine Oppenheim), all cops, most of them with something to hide, up against gang leader Adewale (<em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>'s Eriq Ebouaney) and his younger, impetuous brother Bola (<em>Micmacs</em>' Doudou Masta). Everything seems to be going according to plan. Well, at least according to Murphy's plan, as the gangsters gain the upper hand. But things can always get worse, and they do, quickly. First, the Paris skyline, easily seen from the penthouse apartment where all this is taking place, starts lighting up with explosions, and columns of smoke rise. Then the inhabitants of the apartment realize what's happening--the dead are rising. Since they have presumably eaten everyone in the rest of Paris, they're starting to descend on the projects. (Even the dead, it seems, are snobbish foodies.) But worse, there is no shortage of bodies in the complex itself...

I didn't even get a chance in that short synopsis to mention my favorite character in the film, Rene (<em>Le Professionel</em>'s Yves Pignot), another survivor who lives in the building. He's nuts, and he's easily the best thing about the otherwise generic script (if you squint right, you can see traces of Judge Reinhold's character from <em>Beverly Hills Cop 2</em>, but these days that's an obscure enough reference most people probably didn't catch it). Now, ""generic"" is not necessarily a pejorative term here; if all you're looking for is some good old-fashioned fast-zombie action, <em>La Horde</em>, with its stable of solid actors and competent-if-not-inspired direction, will suffice very well as a turn your brain off and have a good time action film that brings the gore. I watched it in precisely that mode, and it satisfied me, in terms of wanting a generic zombie flick. If you want something that transcends, this is not the place to look, however. ***",1329264000,,2782,5.233183856502242
4295417,3,B0049Y6I7C,"""The Horde"" is a French zombie film, which makes it something different right there.  A group of French police officers, who may or may not be acting on their own, break into a derelict housing project to rescue one of their compatriots from organized criminals.  For no apparent reason, after some shooting goes down, the corpses turn into fast zombies.  I don't mind fast zombies, and I don't mind that we never get an explanation of the zombieism.  It would just be a silly explanation anywhere.  However, even with the introduction of the old man who fought in Vietnam (the pre-US French version of the Vietnam War), ""The Horde"" ends up as a paint-by-numbers zombie film that doesn't really do much of anything with its setting.  Is it supposed to be allegorical, with the underclass and the criminals who live in the tenement playing the part of ""the other"", and for whom the zombies are later a stand-in?  Is it a meditation on the nature of motherhood and relationships?  Is is a nod to old French crime movies?  Or is it just an excuse to kill some zombies?

The set piece alluded to on the cover of the movie is exciting, but it also isn't consistent with the behavior of the zombies; well, the behavior of the zombies isn't consistent.  I could sit here and pick apart the details.  However, if you're looking for a standard zombie actioner, you can do a lot worse than ""The Horde.""  It's much more of a rental than a purchase.",1327968000,,1437,4.56640625
4295418,2,B0049Y6I7C,"The Horde is a film about the imminent zombie apocalypse as seen through the eyes of the stupidest people on the planet.  Not to be confused with Rammbock: Berlin Undead, which is a film about the imminent zombie apocalypse as seen through the eyes of the world's biggest loser on the planet.
The premise is an interesting one, a group of cops want to avenge a fallen comrade by  going after the group responsible for his death.  But the cops are too stupid to get this right so they get caught but fortunately the world is suddenly overrun by zombies and now the two factions must work together if they are to survive through the night.
Now, do you like your zombie films to have an intricate explanation for the arrival of the undead?  The kind of movie that delivers its epidemic in a way that might leave you wondering ""wow, that can really happen.""?  Well too bad.  You won't find any of that right here.  Instead, bad guy gets shot, minutes later, he's up and about, trying to eat everyone's face along with all the other zombies loose in the streets of Paris.
Next, I can't believe people still need to be told to ""SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD!""
The characters in this film are so stupid that they don't even come to this conclusion.  I am so sick of watching movies where a walking corpse inches closer towards someone holding a gun while that person INSISTS that this obviously dangerous creature STOP. In this film you will see countless ammo wasted on body shots, leg shots, and worst of all, one of the gangsters actually DOES shoot one in the head and it goes down, yet everyone else still keeps shooting them in the chest.  The worst part is when one of the mob guys or whatever they are starts fighting them hand to hand.  Actually, I take that back, the worst part is when two of the mobsters start talking about raping one of the zombies.  Really? Rape a zombie? The only time that ever worked was in Dead Girl.
Overall, it's just another zombie movie that brings absolutely nothing new to the table filled with brainless characters you'll wonder what brains the zombies are trying to get at.  If you can't get enough zombie in your daily life by all means go ahead and watch this movie.  I'd say don't watch this movie if...but chances are, if you read this far then you'll probably watch it.  Just watch it for free if you can.

Some Spoilers - Not Many

The plot in a nutshell:  A cop is killed by gangsters in France.  His partners and friends get together to hunt down and kill the gang in their lair in a nearly abandoned high rise apartment building on the seedy edge of Paris.

The night they show up at the apartment building to get revenge on the gang, it goes wrong almost from the get-go.  The cops are captured by the gang, and things look grim.  Things get a lot grimmer when a dead body gets up and goes on a rampage. Worse, the dead are rampaging not only in the gang's hideout, but all over Paris ... and the world.  So, the cops and the gangsters must join forces to survive.  They must work together to reach ground level, wending their way through a rotting, zombie-infested building, if they hope to survive.

The character who is nominally the hero is Ouessem.  Before the cops go on their revenge hunt, the dead policeman's widow makes him promise to keep the others safe.  Fat chance of that, eh? Another important character is the female policewoman, Aurore.  Aurore has a secret  -- oh, does she have a secret.  The other police officers know her secret, but they have no idea of how it is going to drive her survival instincts.

There are two gangsters in ""The Horde"" - brothers from Nigeria - who have their own secret. It's something about what they suffered in Nigeria, and it's never fully explained, but it causes one of the brothers to act impulsively.  Another character is the bigoted French veteran of Vietnam.  He's psychologically twisted as well. You won't think so when the group first meets him, but just you wait.  On the other hand, the Vet knows his way around a machine gun, and that comes in handy when the group finds an improbable stash of weapons in the building.

The machine gun is important because the zombies in ""The Horde"" are fast zombies.

Why I Like Slow Zombies

Zombie fans generally fall into two groups - those who like fast zombies, and those who prefer the""classic"" slow zombies.

 Fast Zombies were popularized in Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead.""[...]  That's not their first appearance - that would be in 1985's hilarious ""Return of the Living Dead."" [...]  But ""Return of the Living Dead"" was a spoof.  Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was kick-ass horrifyingly serious.

I'm a fan of slow zombies.  To me, that's the beautiful thing about zombies.  See, if zombies are slow, you can potentially survive a zombie uprising.  You just have to keep your head, keep moving, and don't let the zombies corner you.  If it comes to a choice of apocalypses, and slow zombies are one of the options, I know which box I'm checking.  Sign me up!

Fast zombies now - they really only worked for me in the movies ""28 Days Later"" [...], ""Zombie Land"" [...] and the drop-dead funny ""Doghouse""[...].  And that's because the zombies in those movies weren't actually dead but living plague victims.  For me, fast zombies imply a fast metabolism, and that only works if the ""zombies"" are alive.

 A FAST zombie that is DEAD is more of a demon. In which case, your chances of survival drop to zero.  That kind of ruins it for me ... EXCEPT ""The Horde"" is the exception.

Maybe the fast zombies work in ""The Horde"" because it's French.  The French have serious style when it comes to fantasy/sci-fi movies. Another French movie I can recommend is the steam-punk detective thriller, ""Dark Portals: The Chronicles of Vidocq.""[...]  It's excellent.

So maybe it's the French style that makes the fast zombies of ""The Horde"" work for me.  Maybe it's the multi-layered characters, so rare for a horror movie.  Maybe it's because of the unflinching bleakness of the plot and the wry humor peeking around the edges.

Make no mistake - ""the Horde"" is horrifying. I dreamed about zombies after I watched ""The Horde."" And they were fast, and in my dream, I was doomed.  Just like in ""The Horde."" So watch it.

You won't be sorry. Unless .. that is ... the zombies catch you.",1305244800,2,4309,4.575916230366492
4295432,5,B0049Y6I7C,"The movie is very different but in a good way. This french made movie for zombies i was very satisfied with its turn out,except for the storyline, other then that its a great zombie flick!",1302912000,4,188,4.4
4295433,5,B0049Y6I7C,"It's nothing new for the living to be the real villains of a zombie movie; but it is an interesting take on the genre to have the greatest violence occur at the start of the picture - and occur among the living rather than between the living and the undead.  The living do not become inhuman because of their battle for survival; they're already that way, because of their continuing battle among themselves.  And given how monstrous the living characters are, it's no wonder the undead are also monstrous; the zombies are merely products of their environment.  Another unique twist is that the ""good guys"" - the cops - are every bit as violent and treacherous as the ""bad guys"" - the drug dealers the cops have come to kill.  And the ending, too, is unique in that it more or less continues the beginning.  No one really grows from the ordeal.  There's a moment near the end when you wonder if escape from the zombie horde might have changed the characters.  But it didn't.  Old hatreds rose above even the most harrowing experience.  Zombies, as we all know, will be zombies; and so too will the living be who they are.",1302220800,,1121,4.50990099009901
4295434,3,B0049Y6I7C,"The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and torn out by the teeming undead. THE HORDE, touted as the first French zombie movie, isn't bad for an inaugural effort. Really, in the zombie apocalypse genre, I don't know that there are that many fresh, new swerves the filmmakers can introduce. So, instead, first time directors Benjamin Rocher and Yannick Dahan go for the old tried and true premise: strangers at odds trapped in a building and forced to work together for mutual survival. THE HORDE tries to go for a mix of undead horror and gritty gangsta crime thriller, and it sort of succeeds.

I like that the film doesn't waste time trying to explain away the zombie virus. The writers, I think, figured that their story can simply piggy back off the previous virus origin plots from all those other zombie flicks that've already gone down the pike. And that's fine. THE HORDE gives us the bare minimum in terms of set-up. Essentially, as night time drops, four revenge-minded cops infiltrate the condemned highrise headquarters of them villains what murdered a fellow police officer. But, then, an unexpected zombie attack - and possibly the end of the world - upstage the taut crime thriller elements.

I don't know how much money went into shooting this film, but every cent shows up onscreen. For a modest undertaking, the make-up and stunts and special effects look very good. These walking cadavers are inspired by those in 28 DAYS LATER, in the sense that they don't shuffle or shamble but tear along like a rotting (but still incredibly fast) Carl Lewis. It's a given that ghouls out to munch on your flesh, when they also happen to be fleet of feet, are even more daunting than their plodding brethren. There are kinetic sequences to savor, such as when one of the goons enthusiastically takes on two of the zombies in the hallway or whenever the intense female cop, Aurore (Claude Perron), springs into action. This female cop, by the way, ends up owning the bulk of the film's moments of badasssery. Keep an eye out for her catfight with a woman zombie. The actors deliver strong character work, but because this is French cinema, they also find room to indulge in farce, as in that scene in which the crazy, old (and kinda racist) coot means to chop off a goon's infected leg and that goon has an issue with that.

Interestingly, post-teaming up, there's a gradual shift in group dynamics - a shaping of several cliques within the clique - as the cop and gangsta survivors don't necessarily stick to their own kind. One cop and one gangster form an unspoken alliance as they realize they are the two most clever and level-headed in the group.

And, again probably because they're French, the directors can't stay away from their artsyfartsy roots. And so we get a disturbing sequence in which you sympathize with a woman zombie and you condemn the inhumanity of the survivors as they torment that zombie, and I guess the film should be applauded for eliciting that sort of reaction from the viewer. I know that, by the end of this film, I didn't give a merde if anyone of these unlikable characters make it thru in one piece. Even the most likable guy - Ouessem the level-headed cop - ends up being too passive-aggressive.

One scene really bugged me, and, clearly, the directors chose to sacrifice internal logic in favor of what they obviously hoped would be a cool and iconic moment. It's that one sequence in which one of our characters, on top of a car, is able to hold off a legion of zombies for three straight minutes (note that these zombies are neither midgets nor armless). And when you factor in that these aren't the classic slow, shuffling zombies coming for you, this scene is really hard to buy into. Thing is, if they'd only made it more plausible, this really would've been a great sequence. And maybe even as iconic as they'd hoped.

For the gorehound, there's good payoff. Plenty of gore and viscera and body parts being devoured and just plain, good old-fashioned splattery splattery. We see the sort of outrageous violence that only a judicious application of heavy artillery, hand grenades, and machetes can deliver. Zombies meet gruesome ends. Not a lot of the survivors survive. Cops. Robbers. Crazy old coots. For the ravenous undead, everyone with a pulse is on the menu.

4295436,5,B0049Y6I7C,"I love the use of sound in this film, from the opening buzzing of flies to that horrific roar/growl/shriek the zombies make.  I also thought that the camera work was well done, especially the way they composed each shot.  Boisterous, frenetic, speedy zombies you don't dare turn your back on; I loved this movie and was more than happy to add it to my collection.  It's a movie I'd like to see again and again.
That said, it wasn't perfect by any means, I'm certain it won't appeal to every zombie devotee.  It all depends on what you're looking for in a zombie flick, what satisfies you on an entertainment level.  This film was French and I decided to watched the dubbed version rather than read the subtitles.  I have no idea if that makes any difference...other than the difficulty of trying to read and watch at the same time.  The film did start out like a standard cop thriller before abruptly turning into a zombie snack-down.  That was a little off-putting.  And, as usual, the merry band of survivors were equally repugnant, at times it was a tossup as to who was scarier, them or the zombies!  Personally, I would have ditched the lot and struck out on my own.  There was so much infighting that I began to wonder if they had forgotten about the zombies.  That, and taking time to use drugs (human nature or a writer's device?).  I suppose they were trying to make up for the lack of a new premise.  Trapped inside a building with zombies on the outside and the inside has been done before.  It's simplistic but it works, they had a lot of room to run; up and down!  Many of the scenes were incredible set pieces, my favorite being the use of a refrigerator.  For me it was less about the actors/characters and all about the action.  And for once the DVD cover was indicative of what the movie was about.

Raw, ragged, and raucous; again, I say I LOVED IT!  This is what I look for in a zombie movie: mayhem.

4295439,4,B0049Y6I7C,"The French film industry has really changed from the days of Goddard and Truffaut. Over the past few years they've headed, big time, into the area of gory and over-violent horror/thrillers such as 'Irreversible,' 'Them' and 'Martyrs.' These movies are disturbing beyond the meaning of the word. 'The Horde' is their entry into the field of the undead.

Here's the scoop. In this film you have a group of people trapped in a dilapidated, high-rise tenement with seemingly no way to escape being eaten by untold numbers of the undead who are both in and outside the building. The twist here is that the group trying to escape is made up of violent criminals and some cops who went to said tenement to kill them as revenge for killing one of their ""brothers.""

That part of the set-up harkens back to Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' but this is a quicker, bloodier and much more violent outing. There are as many bullets spent here as in any John Woo movie and the blood gushes by the gallon. And though the 'kill or be eaten' aspect of this film is no different than other un-dead movies, the thing driving this are the characters. Most of these characters aren't just ghoul chow. You get to know them to the point where you want to see what happens to them. You DO pretty much get to figure out which will die in what order but you will wonder up to the end who finally makes it out alive.

The characters and performances are very good. Claude Perron, who plays the one female in the group, is one tough cop. In one scene she dukes it out with one of the un-dead and beats the crap out of him. I'd love to have her next to me in a fight. She isn't what you call pretty but she has a great face you can't take your eyes off of. The one old guy, a tenant who spent time in Indochina is a real hoot. He helps things from getting too over-wrought.

This is a top shelf entry into the genre. The production values are good. The direction and special effects are good and it moves like a freight train. One complaint I have is that plague which causes the rise of the monsters happens way too quickly. Everything is fine when the cops enter the tenement. But when they reach the apartment where the bad guys are is way under an hour and the city is already under major siege with un-dead and fires everywhere. I could have used a better set-up there but, that aside, if you're into these kinds of movies, this is about as good as it gets.",1299024000,2,2437,4.326039387308534

And even then, will anyone really make it out alive in the end? I won't spoil the ending...

Suffice it to say this is a very competent zombie movie. It's got a bit of what everyone wants. Blood, guts, gore, bad-ass humans kicking the crap out of zombies, a machete, machine guns, a chain gun, etc. Performances are pretty solid. Atmosphere and lighting are all good.

I like that in a way, too, because the zombie crisis that has come from mass production does leave out some things that are nice to watch. This is especially true hen it comes to overseas pictures, with seiries like Dead Set mixing with amines like High School of the Dead and so on. In this set-up you have people trying to survive as the dead take over everything, making it an easy-understood outing. you do not have a reason behind the outbreak - sometimes a good thing - knowing what the people know. and they only know a few things, including that they need to stay alive.

As far as this goes, I was happy. i liked the effect work and I liked the people cast and i thought the atmosphere was nice. I personally didn't think that the movie was hurt in too many ways and it didn't ask me to believe too much garbage that my head hurt.

""A Well-Produced, Smart Zombie Thriller"" as noted by one reviewer sums things up. This French, sub-titled Zombie entry is indeed well produced and features a solid and competent cast who battle a horde of Zombies in a vacant apartment complex. Most of the SFX are decent, though the humans don't seem to learn that head shots are required to terminate the animated dead. That was frustrating, though there are enough well placed ""squibs"" to hold your attention. There was also no explanation to account for the plague, & the plot consisted of the usual ""fight for survival"". Although the Zombies are stage one Snyder runners, they are credible and extremely vicious. As the undead featured in THE HORDE are apparently all fresh kills, I suppose their degree of rot would be minimal, (darn). The effects crew however, certainly got the color of human blood ""splat"" on! Memorable scenes included the use of a machine gun in a narrow hallway to dispatch many of the undead. A last stand made by one of our ""heroes"" on the roof of a car was also noteworthy. Had there been less competition among our motley cast (none of whom you will cheer for), and more carnage, we may have had a new Zombie classic on our hands.

We get no explanation about the zombie epidemic other than what characters are watching on garbled TV newscasts. The group of besieged humans is assorted conveniently and demographically by race, sex, and criminal background. It would make more sense for the splintered group to cooperate, but their petty differences continue to plague them throughout the movie. They at point capture and torture a zombie so much that you wonder who's more lacking in humanity--the virus-plagued zombie or the humans who don't have an excuse for their behavior. All of this adds up to a bracing dose of intelligence that will satisfy the zombie purist.

What's different here is that the directors have jazzed up their material that might remind you of Reservoir Dogs and other low-rent American crime movies. The whiplash editing in the movie's first 20 minutes and its cranked up sound design took me a few minutes to adjust to. The lead black actor has an intended similarity to Samuel Jackson. He's the movie's super-cool no-nonsense conscience.

So the movie has lots going for it--slam-bang action with social commentary at the core. The movie features fast-moving zombies--which is perhaps its main divergence from the Romero tradition.

I can't give it 5 stars only because it doesn't really break new ground. Its borrowings from American crime cinema are more of a gimmick than a meaningful contribution to zombie flicks. And all of that bang-bang rapid editing is too jarring--it's all just camouflage to disguise the lack of true innovation or (like 28 Days Later) true visual elegance.

The false bravado just becomes old real fast.  The cops weren't much better.  Both groups are constantly putting members of their own groups as well as the opposition.  The zombie killing action wasn't anything special, there is a scene like on the cover where just one character does just that, stands and fires down on a heap of zombies.  Got pretty boring after a while.  The zombies themselves didn't look that great, but you've got to take into account they must have been freshly turned for this plot to be plausible.",1483142400,,1279,4.385593220338983
8419498,4,B0049Y6I7C,"A group of Parisian cops are reeling from the loss of one of their own at the hands of a drug dealer and his cronies. Some of them decide to get revenge by storming their enemies' hideout when zombies suddenly attack. The criminals and cops are forced to work together in a tenuous truce in order to survive.

I have been meaning to watch this film for literally years. The Horde has a different premise than a lot of films. The cops are in huge trouble after trying to infiltrate criminal headquarters when zombies actually save them from certain death. The criminals and cops have to put aside their differences, but they still snipe at each other. Both groups have experience fighting for their lives and with different types of weapons. Keeping a cool head is paramount and some people on either side won't let go of their feud. Arguments and near fights happen a lot. It's understandable since both sides of killed their members of the opposing faction, but the leaders see they have to bury the hatchet permanently to have a small chance of success. This situation seems more realistic than everyone being best friends during an apocalypse situations.

I was bothered by the way female characters were treated and portrayed in the film. The only human female character is Aurore, who is currently pregnant with another policeman's baby. When the apocalypse hits, she automatically goes all ""my baby is the most important thing ever."" This does drive her to fight back harder, but it also allows her emotions to cloud her judgment. She pretty much sabotages the entire group as a result after others throw her pregnant state in her face and dismiss her judgments. I didn't find her likeable at all, but I respected her at the beginning of the film. By the end, I felt she acted very out of character. She also did other nonsensical things like abandoning her bulletbroof vest and leather jacket that could actually protect her from zombie attacks to sport a tank top with no bra. Seems like the male audience was more important than practicality.

The men in the film treat a female zombie in a most disturbing way. Both men are criminals and not the most moral, but I had grown to like them throughout the film. This scene completely destroyed that. A female zombie couldn't walk anymore and the men start to taunt her. Then they make horrible sexual comments about her and threaten to rape her. This is a nonsentient rotting corpse, but it's clear these men have made comments like this before. They see this rotting thing the same way they see living women, as a subhuman thing for them to do whatever they want with. This with the disdainful treatment of Aurore and her out of character behavior left a bad taste in my mouth.

The film as a whole is enjoyable. The action scenes are exciting. I didn't think there could be so many zombies in one building. The sheer numbers of the horde are shocking and incredibly dangerous. Although I had some problems with the treatment of women, The Horde had some unforgettable scenes and a unique situation.",1478736000,,3056,4.69589552238806
