5157477,4,B008F0QBB4,"This documentary is a superbly executed expose of British Bomber Command in World War II where 59,000 young volunteers sacrificed their lives bringing the battle to Nazi's while the rest of the world reeled or dawdled. Everything about this production is flawless except the unfortunate second-guessing of Bomber Command's area bombing of civilian population centers in Germany. Viewers of this documentary need to keep in mind that left wing politics suffered a monumental blow on a world stage when Hitler betrayed England by attacking Poland (and touching off world war). This betrayal brought conservative Winston Churchill to prominence on the world stage, and so leftist were interested then, and remain interested today, in finding fault with Churchill's prosecution of the war in any way they could and can. England and all the free world owe unending, unqualified gratitude to Bomber Command.",1356739200,10,901,5.397163120567376
5157478,5,B008F0QBB4,"This 89 minute DVD is strictly about the Lancaster bombers in the RAF Bomber command in WWII. The presentation is excellent. It uses period films and interviews from those who were flying in the Lancaster. Actor Ewan McGregor and his brother Colin, a former RAF pilot explore the Lancaster during the war years. Colin, the former RAF pilot goes through a recreation of how the Lancaster pilots would have been trained. We really get the feel of how hard it was to fly these planes, even for an experienced pilot, much less a new one.

The film starts in 1940, some mention is made of the Americans entering the war, but this is strictly a RAF show. A lady who helped rivet, what was called 10,000 rivets flying in close formation, even has them try their hand at riveting. They put on full gear and show how hard it was for a tail gunner to squeeze into his position. This is also a departure from many other films in that the enlisted men of the crew are interviewed about how their jobs were carried out. Too often these men are forgotten, it is commendable that they were included.
German pilots are interviewed, even one showing his record of the Lancasters he shot down. A pub that was frequented by the airman is visited. They go to Hamburg to talk to survivors of the firestorm raid. This is a complete look at the bomber boys. One can only wish there was as complete of a record like this of their American counterparts with each of the American bombers.

The film ends with the unbelievable fact that the bomber command and their men were almost shunned by any memorial, one only being dedicated recently; mainly because of the Dresden firebombing.
This is a wonderful account. However it has no subtitles; and for a film that many of an older generation might want to see and listen to, one would think subtitles would have been included. There are no extras on the disc.",1353024000,77,1881,4.529411764705882
5157479,4,B008F0QBB4,"If you've seen Ewan and Colin McGregor in their Battle of Britain documentary and enjoyed it, then you'll also enjoy this film about Bomber Command. It's informative, interesting, and entertaining. There is wonderful color footage of the Avro Lancaster.  Only 2 Lancaster Bombers are flying in the world today. One is flying in England and one in Canada. So it's a real treat to watch this historic aircraft.",1349222400,27,408,5.0

5157495,5,B008F0QBB4,Quite a good dvd.  From the description I had thought that this was a feature film.  This is a documemtary about the Lancaster bomber - and a very good documentary at that.  This is a good addition to an avistion buff's collection.,1425427200,,231,4.4523809523809526

5157497,3,B008F0QBB4,"This DVD gives some useful information about the experience of serving in a bomber flying night missions over Germany in WWII.  It is, however mostly just fluff.  It could have explained where the different crew members were stationed, and explained their duties.  It did show some of the tail gunners problems, but that was about it.",1420761600,,334,4.928571428571429

5157507,1,B008F0QBB4,"One star for 'Bomber Boys' production because it lets you see very little of the Lancaster and the in-flight Lancaster scene is disappointingly brief. Five stars, however, go to the interviews with the veterans of Bomber Command.",1401062400,2,229,5.216216216216216
5157508,4,B008F0QBB4,"I really enjoyed the scenes of one of the last two Lancaster bombers in flying condition.  It was very dramatic and well contrasted with the scenes of dozens of Lancasters flying in another movie, ""The Dam Busters"" which I received shortly thereafter. I was very moved by the lack of recognition in Britain of the men who flew their bombers for five long years.",1400889600,,361,4.640625
5157509,5,B008F0QBB4,Lots of information from this DVD.  Enjoyed the balance between learning to fly the current Lancaster and what it took in the 1940's.  Bomber Harris is discussed.  If you have an interest in WW2 aviation this DVD won't disappoint you.,1400544000,,234,4.8

5157511,4,B008F0QBB4,Fascinating documentary about the Brits who flew bombers during World War II. So young; so many didn't come back. I like MacGregor's brother as much as I like him.,1396396800,2,163,4.655172413793103

5157513,5,B008F0QBB4,"This was a really an enlightening documentary.  I have seen so many documentaries about American day bombings, but this is the first specifically about British nighttime bombings.  I knew about the German night fighters, but it was interesting to hear the tail gunners view point.  Most importantly, I knew that the British public was not crazy about the Harriss bombing campaign, but I felt horrible about how the population ignored their accomplishments.  Shame on them to not recognize how important the British bombing campaign was to winning the war.",1392595200,,555,5.202247191011236
5157514,5,B008F0QBB4,Ewan McGregor and his brother have a wonderful bond which showed out through the whole story.  Their compasion and wit was very good to see as well as the wonderful Lancaster bomber.,1391644800,,182,4.6875
5157515,3,B008F0QBB4,Not what we expected. Interesting story of the Lancaster in WW11. Expected  a war movie not a documentary but otherwise a good presentation of the bomber.,1389657600,,154,4.923076923076923

5157517,5,B008F0QBB4,"Two very likable brothers delve into the largely neglected history of Bomber Command and its  heroes .  Instead of another collection of grainy actual combat footage, we get gentlemanly interviews,  we go along as one of the film makers flys the only remaining flying Lancaster and we get an even-handed examination of the ethical questions about area bombing of cities .
  I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't find fault with anything in it .",1387497600,,443,4.776315789473684
5157518,4,B008F0QBB4,I like WWII war stories especially about the wonderful Lancaster bomber especially since I am a Brit who grew up as a child during the war.,1385078400,,139,4.384615384615385
5157519,2,B008F0QBB4,"I expected a realistic WW2 Bomber film, more on the lines of "" A Piece of Cake"".which is the best series covering those years.",1380844800,,126,4.291666666666667
5157520,5,B008F0QBB4,"The RAF bomber crews were much maligned after the war because of the bombing raid on Dresden. The war was almost over and many felt that the raid on Dresden was overkill. However, you have to be there, to have endured and suffered the devastation of your homeland, the deaths of your loved ones and the desire to give it back to the enemy. The sons of a RAF Crewman go through this docu-drama to learn what it was like for their father and the rest of the bomber crews. There is much information that was kept secret in the British archives that were released to make this film. The statistics they revealed was startling but I'll save that for the film.",1377561600,8,654,4.368852459016393
5157521,5,B008F0QBB4,"As good as the brothers video on fighter command.
Very well done and heartfelt.
If they do more, I will get them.",1366761600,,113,4.181818181818182
5157522,5,B008F0QBB4,"This is a well done follow on to the ""Battle of Britain"" documentary the McGreggor brothers did a year earlier.  There was quite a bit of discussion about area bombing and particular emphasis on the Hamburg and Dreden bombings.  At one point Ewan mentions the killing of 42000 civilians in the same breath as the killing of 6 million Jews.  Personally I don't think it is a fair comparison but total war is a very ugly thing to ponder.  Altogether I think it was a compationate treatment of both sides of the area bombing campaign.",1366761600,,531,4.557894736842106
5157523,5,B008F0QBB4,"Along with the Battle of Britain documentary done by the brothers McGregor this is an excellent, though sobering, film.
The losses taken by the bomber crews of the British bomber force and the American 8th Air Force is truly staggering.  It is also not well-known except among history buffs.",1363737600,,291,4.938775510204081
5157524,5,B008F0QBB4,"One of the best ever documentaries of the WW11 Bomber Boys from the RAF. Highly recommended. The actor Ewan McGregor and his pilot brother do extroardinary interviews, and land up being allowed to actually fly the only remain Lancaster bomber in the UK.",1361059200,12,253,4.906976744186046
5157525,5,B008F0QBB4,I wasn't sure what to expect but this documentary is interesting and informative.  We thoroughly enjoyed.  If you like WWII history or even if you don't like history at all you will surely enjoy this DVD.,1359936000,,204,4.638888888888889
5157526,5,B008F0QBB4,I gave this to my nephew for Christmas. He is a WWII enthusiast and loved it. My father fought in the RAF and flew Lancasters in WWII so this is a memory of him and his service.,1358640000,,177,3.810810810810811
5157527,3,B008F0QBB4,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is strictly for history buff's.  I misread the information, and thought it was another action movie, which it was not.  Merchandise is quality and certainly there is nothing wrong with the actor Ewan and his brother.  I was just not interested in the history dialogue.",1358035200,,317,4.833333333333333

8527221,5,B008F0QBB4,"having been one of them, it was exceptionally well done.  Would have liked a bit more war footage, although hard to get.  The interviews were spot on.  Lost a lot of my mates on bombers.  I flew in Halifaxes which never got the same PR as the Lancaster, rather like the Hurricane/Spitfire debate as to which was the best.",1506124800,2,321,4.389830508474576

8527223,5,B008F0QBB4,"What a brilliant job these two brothers have done!  I saw their Battle of Britain documentary a year ago, and even after a rather vast amount of reading on the topic (my distant cousin was apparently a Battle of Britain RAF Spitfire pilot, killed a year later, in 1941), I still found quite a bit in that documentary that I hadn't known!  Regarding this one, I just finished it w/in the hour past, and I'm still thrilled by the intelligent scope and sensitive moral treatment that they gave!  Hats off to these two!  Brilliant!",1480636800,4,527,4.574468085106383
8527224,5,B008F0QBB4,"Not a grand documentary, but a good one about the British Lancaster bombers and their crews in WWII.  Was surprised Ewan and brother pulled it off as more than a side bit.
