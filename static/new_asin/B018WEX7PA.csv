7559026,5,B018WEX7PA,"This wonderful documentary follows drag queen Jerick Hoffer/Jinkx Monsoon from before they were on RuPaul's Drag Race to after achieving international success. It provides the audience with a glimpse into the life of an incredibly gifted individual and tells their backstory with interviews from family and friends as well as showing Jerick Hoffers warm and quirky personality.
Personally this is the one release I've been waiting for all year, I can thoroughly recommend it.",1449100800,8,475,5.4324324324324325
7559027,5,B018WEX7PA,Genius! A beautiful glimpse into the life of a beautiful soul! The cinematography  and attention to detail are gorgeous and each scene feels like you are having an intimate conversation with Jinkx and friends/family. I could watch it over and over again!,1449100800,6,254,5.0476190476190474
7559028,4,B018WEX7PA,"I loved this doc. I love Jinkx, I love Drag Race, I love the art of performance. I feel this is the real side of Jerrick we don't get to see. Jerrick isn't always flashy and witty with just enough camp. They are a person. I especially loved watching all the home videos of when he was still a kid doing drag shows early on. Their genius is clear from the beginning. I give it four stars because it could have been shorter. The material definitely dragged (no pun intended) in the middle, but maybe that was the point. Either way, I would definitely recommend this for the casual performer or drag fan.",1506297600,,601,4.327433628318584

7559031,3,B018WEX7PA,"Jinkx was very impressive on Drag Race, but this doc didn't showcase her unique sparkle as much as I expected. It felt quite cheap at times--the bathroom scene, the bedroom scene, the sunbathing scene, zooming in so much the image blurred when she undressed, the lengthy smoking montage.

Her family seemed to divulge certain info and then soften it. On Drag Race, it sounded like Jinkx was the de facto adult as her mom was very irresponsible as a parent for many years. In the doc, her mom simply says she drank and thought everyone was having a good time along with her.

The absentee dad seemed like he was trying really hard to say the right things to maintain their tenuous relationship. The family didn't have to air their dirty laundry or reopen old wounds, but it was uncomfortable watching them give accounts that didn't quite mesh with previous details.

It started out strong and ""The Death Becomes Her""story was so perfectly Jinkx. I would've loved to have seen more of that kind of revelation instead of all the lingering body shots.",1505347200,,1047,4.7103825136612025
7559032,5,B018WEX7PA,Loved seeing more of Jinx and her family. What a hard-working talented person they are. Thank you Amazon for making this available so more people can be liberated by the unstoppable force of the Monsoon,1505347200,,202,4.8

7559036,5,B018WEX7PA,"I didn't watch Drag Race until the season after Jinx was on. So I wasn't clued into the Monsoon Season phenomenon.

I went back after and caught it but still saw the clown more than the person. Reality TV isn't a good way to get to know someone? Who knew?

This film is like the subject, multi-layered, complex, and at times conflicted.

Did I learn a lot about him and his family? Yes.

Were there times it was hard to watch? Absolutely. Were those moments made all the more heartbreaking because this movie is as much a story of his biological family as it is about the performer.

His friends honestly come off as cyphers and stereotypes.

There is a lot of leering at every inch of supple male flesh on display.

The bathroom scene was funny, but felt gratuitous.

So why the 5 stars?

Because this document is a tour-de-force when it comes to taking a deep dive into the psyche of a talented performer who pulled himself up by his garter belts and made something amazing.

Warts and all, sad asides with his Dad; hopeful ones with his other family.

This is a film that I believe will move you.

I know it moved me.",1505001600,2,1120,4.357487922705314

7559043,5,B018WEX7PA,"Such a fascinating look into the world of Jinkx Monsoon. I especially loved how it gave insight into the process of filming the RPDR finale episode. It's where I learned that they film all 3 queens winning and that the winner doesn't find out who wins until we (the public) do. That was a mind blower to me. So basically all of the 3 possible winners are filmed ""winning"" and then RuPaul edits out the others and shows the real winner live. I thought that was cool.

If you're already a fan of Jinkx, you'll really enjoy this film!!",1497916800,2,532,4.373737373737374

7559054,5,B018WEX7PA,"Really enjoyed this. A great perspective from a drag entertainer and winner of RuPaul's Drag Race. Shows a lot of old videos from before Jinx's fame, explores the backstory and family environment then and now. Shot in a creative and sensitive way. One of the best docs about the art of drag I've seen. Highly recommended if you are a fan of Jinx Monsoon or enjoy watching drag shows and RuPaul's Drag Race.",1490227200,,406,4.575342465753424
7559055,5,B018WEX7PA,"From the moment I learned who Jinkx was, I wanted to know everything about her. That's the kind of character she is; bright, unapologetic, intelligent, and kind, and she leaves you spellbound. All of those traits are also authentic to Jerick themself, and it was wonderful being able to learn more about them and the journey they've been on to get to where they are. If you're a fan of Jinkx, or drag queens, or LGBT stories, I think you'll get a lot out of this film. I highly recommend it.",1487116800,,491,4.406593406593407

7559068,5,B018WEX7PA,"Absolutely amazing. I do agree that I'm judging on a bias here because Jinkx is just amazing to me, but getting to see the day to day life of these performers and artists doing their best and performing at the peak for their craft is just inspiring. Jerick plunges you into his life and his past unapologetically, exposing himself to the world in a way that we don't normally see. People who are fans of Drag Queens and RuPaul's Drag Race in general, I feel, have a warped perception of how these queens live and the life they have already lived. It's great to see that not everything is glitter and extravaganza all the time.",1478217600,,626,4.452173913043478

7559070,5,B018WEX7PA,"Great flick. As a Drag Race fan, it was a fantastic behind the scenes look at the person within the persona. To see the deep appreciation Jinkx for the art form itself and the foundation that was laid at such and early age to be a fully formed multifaceted entertainer. It was perfectly paced and very well shot. Some LGBT docs can look and feel very low budget...not the case here.",1476403200,,382,4.394366197183099

7559076,5,B018WEX7PA,"What this documentary does better than anything else is that it takes Jerick/Jinkx and humanizes her and the persona of Jinkx Monsoon, which I believe was something that the reality television platform of Drag Race could never even hoped to have achieved.  Since her appearance on Drag Race I have found myself continually enamored by the charm of Jinkx Monsoon and for the first time while looking at a drag queen I had thought to myself, ""Here is a person that I truly would enjoy getting to know better in person.""  It seemed though I just had to settle for seeing her appear on tour.  This documentary strips Jinkx of her makeup and shows her life filled with love, friends, and a few family/growing up struggles that many lgbt youth can find easy to relate to.

Jinkx Monsoon is funny, quirky, smart, loving, independent, and one hell of a performer.  I highly recommend this to any fan of Jinkx, as well as anyone who is curious about the life of a drag queen.  Jinkx is admirable in that she does her best to be a good brother, son, grandson, and friend to many.  She spreads love, joy, and laughter to her audiences everywhere through her comedy or rather her charisma, uniqueness, nerve AND talent.  Jinkx is a queen who exemplifies believing in yourself.  She rolled with the punches and well the rest to her; it was all just water off a duck's back.",1474243200,,1360,4.563786008230453

7559086,5,B018WEX7PA,"Wow! What a soul! I love how honest and reflective he is about how the experience on Drag Race affected his relationships. Some of the unknowns that people have when they think about being ""famous"" and how it will change a person, Jerick addresses very openly. I really appreciate how aware he is of personhood. My personal opinion is that it wasn't Drag Race that helped his family have it's second wave, it was him always being himself (compassionate, understanding, trying to meet people where they are at and build them up) that was highlighted on a show like Drag Race to show everyone and the world a heart and the humanity in people doing Drag and has elevated Drag and the LBGTQIQ community even further in mainstream! We all need to see more examples of love, of humor, of REALNESS in every facet of life, but definitely in Drag, Jinkx makes it beautiful and sexy too. :)",1472169600,3,880,4.575949367088608

Crazy though, I know I watched the season of RuPaul's Drag Race (which is too damn expensive to watch this season btw) that Jerick/Jinx was on and I'm not sure how I never connected it, but I had seen The Vlaudevillians years and years ago when they performed with my friend Daniel Blackmoor's act and LOVE LOVE LOVED the show!!!  It's really neat to watch this and remember that night!  I'm not really into documentaries usually, but this was seriously an awesome find!!  Keep it up J... You're amazing!!",1464048000,,617,4.5225225225225225
7559115,5,B018WEX7PA,"Jinkx is a treasure trove of brilliance and talent.  An old soul, she--like RuPaul--is a timeless queen who sustains and preserves drag's immortality by her fluency in historical references, milieus and traditions.  She understands iconic glamour and humor as easily as she does modern day.  When she debuted on RuPaul's Drag Race, I was instantly enamored by Jinkx's aura:  a true artist.  She comes across as a very real, open person.  Talent oozes out of her, yet she is not arrogant or catty.  She is simply Jinkx.  She doesn't fall prey to the competition and insecurities of other queens.  She is so damned good at what she does.  Jinkx doesn't need to waste time playing games or scheming to get ahead.  In the movie, she says something that really sums her spirit up:  she competes *with* people, not *against* people.  I enjoyed learning about her growing up, the family and friends who encouraged and cared about her long before fame. Very enjoyable and visually beautiful film.",1461974400,7,988,4.879518072289157

It goes into emotion, the drag life, personal life, his childhood, family, and more I'm sure I'm forgetting. It doesn't shy away from touchy subjects, or what some may consider touchy subjects.

Silly Queen, there are VERY few ""DQs"" that rise to the astonishing ""Artistry"" of Jinx Monsoon.
This brilliant personal video of what makes Jinx Monsoon one of Ru Paul' s most successful and
endearing Drag Queens leaves you both wistful and wishing for more and more of her performances.
She is a genius at creating a fantasy of female realism that she then mixes with incredible vocal
talent and showmanship. What an artist of amazing abilities.....far more than a simple ""Drag Queen"", Jinx
expresses a set of enduring talents and an awareness of all the elements of the  human spirit. Best
of all, she lives to share it with those who come to see her.  She is my absolute ""FAVE"" of all ten
