3445767,5,B001A5ES9S,"Two of the most loved Scooby-Doo movies on one DVD. What more could you ask for? My daughter absolutely LOVES this!! Scooby-Doo Ghoul School is one that can be watched over and over. It is where Shaggy agrees to sign on as a teacher at the Ghoul School not realizing it's ""scary"". Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo tag along with Shaggy for his boarding school job. What they don't realize is that the students are the daughters of: Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Phantom of the Opera and The Werewolf. The House Mother/Principal is a Witch and they have a dragon who runs around named Matches. There's a (normal) boys' military school next door that yearly has a volleyball match against the girls' school.
Scooby-Doo Legend of the Vampire This one includes the entire gang excluding Scrappy-Doo. In Legend of the Vampire they are in Australia. While in Australia, the gang sees a poster about a band contest/concert. They go to check it out and see some old friends from the United States, their old friends, the band, The Hex Girls. Daniel, one of the producers of the concert, wonders why the girls have stopped playing. They said ""We just are talking some of our old friends here from the US."" Then they introduced them all. Then Daniels said, ""Oh, Good, I was just afraid you....."" you'll find out the rest in the movie. I don't want to ruin the rest for you. BUT, I promise it's good. You'll love this double set.",1417478400,,1420,4.661354581673307
