8126817,3,B000FUIUFM,"OK, I bought this back in 1995....maybe 1996 when I joined the Lisa Cook Fan Club out of Fangoria Magazine. Yep the movie is pretty much the lowest form on independent cinema along with ""Plan 9"".  But I take my hat off to Todd and Lisa Cook, they made this and marketed this on their own and some of their friends.  Effects are cheesy....cigarrete smoke backwards for instance....but with almost no budget and no frills you shouldn't expect James Cameron material.  It's a good movie to rent and see on a lark, maybe watch once with some friends and play Mystery Science Theater with it. (enough plugs?)",1352073600,,603,4.616822429906542
8126818,3,B000FUIUFM,"this film is total cheeze and targeted to a ""anything with the words death metal in the title"" audience. i own a few titles like this ""faces of schlock"",""attitude for destruction"" and this film ""death metal zombies"" takes the cake! all the songs featured in this film are the ""background noise"", the acting is bargin basement
and the killings are superficial, you can tell they are fake.

the ""making of"" documentary is only 30 seconds! maybe i am wrong here,but, i was expecting better from a movie call death metal zombies.

the time on the box says 93 minutes but the film actually runs at 1hr. 22minutes
and some seconds.

i wonder,was this ""horror"" film financed by relapse records? whomever commissoned
this film to be made (horrroscope films) i strongly suggest writer/producer/director
Mr. Todd Jason Cook and actress Lisa Cook, go to school/college and get some film
production training and some acting training. this film does look like it cost less than 10,000 to make.
my only reason for 3 stars is 1. i love the music used in the film, 2. the film title works and 3. the story line is original. the special affects and character potrayals need work.",1302307200,,1162,4.7711442786069655

ok I love movies that look like the were made on a sunday afternoon by a group of friend with no money but alot of left over zombie props from random personal collections and this is pretty much just that... if you like laughing at bad acting and seeing zombies get messed up then this one is on the maybe list for you... kinda slow but if your a collecter like me then well just get it and find out for yourself... otherwise just pass this one up cause this is for a ""target audiance""",1294963200,,529,4.196078431372549
8126820,1,B000FUIUFM,"I love B movies,but this was horrible. It look like a bunch of kids with a camcorder on a drunken weekend. The story made no sense,I couldn't even get through the whole movie(first time ever for me).The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't give it 0.",1202601600,2,266,4.235294117647059
8126821,4,B000FUIUFM,"If you invest in this movie, buy the 10th Anniversary edition. Much better quality product. The story line is still the same and the qualities that have made it be around for 10 years are still there. Editing and quality of the film is 110% better. Not sure what they used the first time, but definitely a nice upgrade. This movie is a cult classic. A must have in your horror collection regardless of what you read about it - whether they like it or not - people will always end up telling you it's a must have for a million reasons. You will watch it often with friends while sharing beers and laugh. Probably even come up with some drinking games while watching it. It's a brainless story line, but fun. Relapse Records did a good job of picking out songs for this. Even if you aren't a lover of death metal, the songs don't blow your ears out and distract from the movie.",1155340800,2,875,4.3090909090909095
