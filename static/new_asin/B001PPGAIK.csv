3755250,5,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann spent five years down-under and now comes up for air with a thrilling, epic love story; it could have been a Warner Bros. Errol Flynn movie. But Flynn is gone. Doesn't matter. Here is Hugh Jackman(sexiest man in the world).  Nicole Kidman stars as a prissy Englishwoman who finds her husband engulfed in dire financial problems at his cattle ranch in Australia. Being self-willed, our young lady travels all the way to the ranch, to settle the problems, and sell the whole property. Arriving in Australia, our missy finds her husband murdered by a local native known as King George(or did he do it?), and her cattle ranch in an uproar. She fires the leering foreman, and considers hiring the dark, husky young Drover to help her get her cattle to market. But she doesn't like him. He's so pushy. He's so arrogant.... then again...Sound familiar? Well, there's no particularly new ground here, but there is a sprawling, colorful, sweeping saga filmed on location in Queensland, Wales, and Australia, surrounded by loving, masterful cinema strokes from one of our finest directors. CGI and rotoscope effects anchor beautiful, majestic shots of the baking desert and high country. It's hot, and things heat up as Kidman starts to melt, starting from the first night on the trail, when Jackman takes his shirt off to shower.  At almost three hours, ""Australia"" is too long, but boredom is not an option. Baz Luhrmann's 2001 musical classic ""Moulin Rouge"" was held captive in a Parisian dance-hall. Luhrmann's new ""Australia""  explodes with the same quick-cut, self-confident magical movie-making style. Here is an honest, touching, magical journey. Here is a young boy and a native king, both born of the desert, and bound not to live without it. Here  is a story not bound to a wooden Parisian stage(""Moulin Rouge""). Here is a story not bound at all. Here is a story 'bout all of ""Australia"".",1227744000,7,1902,4.91588785046729
3755251,4,B001PPGAIK,"""Australia"" may in fact be Baz Luhrmann's most ambitious film, a love story about as epic in scope as the country itself. It's in some ways a departure from his first three films--""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" and ""Moulin Rouge""--all of which were told in the language of theatrical opulence; ""Moulin Rouge,"" for example, was a delightful sight and sound frenzy, with an operatic tragedy set against the backdrop of flashy sets and creative special effects. Even though it took place in 1899 Paris, it's about a time and place that could only exist in the imagination. Now we have ""Australia,"" which doesn't go for all-out fantasy but instead pays homage to the period melodramas of yesteryear. It presents us with a fabled but not wholly unrealistic setting, and despite a number of cumbersome details, the plot follows one of the most basic love-story formulas ever conceived of, namely two people from very different worlds falling in love.

Some may criticize this film for its lack of originality. But keep in mind that we're talking about a fable, which is to say that Luhrmann never needed to reinvent the wheel. Every character is a tried and true archetype, and they're part of a story that's essentially a sweeping romance, the likes of which haven't been seen since ""Gone With the Wind."" The sentiment is reflected in the film's cinematography, which is striking to say the least; many shots are majestic bird's-eye views of distant landscapes, all obviously meant to fill every square inch of the broad Cinemascope format. And then there's David Herschfelder's grandiose score, which is clearly evocative of a love that will carry on no matter what. Such a love blooms between an English aristocrat named Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) and a rugged Australian stockman known only as the Drover (Hugh Jackman); they have virtually nothing in common, yet on a cattle drive across the Outback, they discover that they have feelings for one another.

All this is completely expected and very well done. The only real flaw is that, at 165 minutes, the film is too long. Beginning in 1939 at the height of World War II, ""Australia"" interweaves a few too many themes and subplots, meaning there always seemed to be a lack of focus. Prim and proper Lady Ashley arrives in Australia to retrieve her husband, who owned a cattle station called Faraway Downs just southwest of a town called Darwin. She inherits the station when she discovers that her husband has been killed. She then learns that a rival group of English cattle barons, led by the wealthy King Carney (Bryan Brown), are plotting to steal her property; Carney relies on a ruthless Australian station manager named Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), a villain in every sense. Faced with the prospect of driving an entire herd of cattle through the Outback, Lady Ashley enlists the help of the Drover, who makes it clear that he only works for commission--no one hires him, and no one fires him.

Tagging along is a half-blooded Aborigine boy named Nullah (Brandon Walters), who doubles as the film's narrator. His inclusion represents Luhrmann's personal disapproval of Australia's former racial policies, specifically the forced enslavement and brainwashing of Aboriginal children (which, appallingly, wasn't stopped until 1973). It's quite possible he made this film partially in response to the fact that his government formally apologized to indigenous peoples this year. A well-rounded social commentary to be sure, although I can't help but wonder how relevant it is given the fact that the film is, above all, a classic period drama. Still, Nullah takes part in some of the film's best moments, not the least of which is a beautiful scene featuring Lady Ashley telling him the story of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Watching their feelings for one another grow was certainly satisfying; for all intents and purposes, she becomes his mother by the end of the film.

Nullah also was a nice counterpart to his grandfather (David Gulpilil), a wise and mysterious Aborigine who is both a spiritual guide and a physical protector. It may seem he has the ability to appear and disappear at will, although it's more likely that such moments represent Nullah's state of mind. Because he often yearns for his grandfather, it's almost as if he's right there with him.

As with ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet,"" ""Australia"" begins in the spirit of good fun, only to grow more and more serious. By the time we reach the final forty-five minutes or so, the Japanese have begun bombing the country, which puts Lady Ashley, the Drover, and Nullah in an entirely new dramatic situation. It becomes less of a western and more of a war drama. As with the rest of the film, the climactic last act was visually splendid and wonderfully structured. There was, however, a creeping sense that it belonged in a different film, which is worrisome considering the skill employed by the filmmakers. But in no way does it ruin the entire experience. Despite some length, focus, and pacing issues, ""Australia"" is a stirring film, at times fun, at times touching, always adhering to the traditions that defined some of our more famous Hollywood romance stories. For characters that are deliberately broad, the actors give very enjoyable performances. It was especially nice to watch Jackman, who has so rarely been allowed to use his natural accent. And as for Kidman, well, the fact that she's such a talented actress should tell you everything.",1227657600,2,5510,4.971800433839479
3755252,5,B001PPGAIK,"Australia is the movie that all movies wish they were. Nicole Kidman gives an Oscar worthy performance, easily one of the best of the year. Hugh Jackman and Brandon Walters are also great, and so are the supporting players. The film is STUNNING.",1227657600,4,245,4.72093023255814
3755253,3,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann's latest effort manages an epic feel and an extreme runtime, though sadly the former is oftentimes a result of the latter.  Vibrant colors and gorgeous cinematography can't quite balance out the confusion caused from the rotation of genres as the film progresses in and out of action, romance, drama, musical, comedy, and more.  And while not every successful epic need be tragic, the tragedy befalling the protagonists of Australia never quite becomes emotional enough to warrant a very deep audience attachment.

When English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to Australia to deal with the selling of an inherited cattle ranch, she discovers a plot to monopolize the beef trade with the military by ruthless cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown).  Determined to fight the hostile takeover of her land, Lady Sarah hires the roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman) to help lead 2,000 head of cattle across the unforgiving Australian terrain to the city of Darwin.  But the cattle drive is just the beginning of their adventures as a begrudged stock-man conspires against them and the threat of the war looms imminently over the horizon.

In Australia's epic scope, the first half of the film is disgracefully dull. The cinematography is the only thing that stands out amongst the uninspired storyline that borrows heavily from the tones, the characters, and the settings of memorable films like City Slickers, Crocodile Dundee, The Cowboys, and Quigley Down Under.  Drover rescues the unprepared Lady Ashley from all sorts of humor-injected mayhem in the playful mood of Crocodile Dundee and Matthew Quigley, and his own personality is little more than a blend of John Wayne's Wil Andersen with Billy Crystal's Mitch Robbins. The idea of droving cattle with a mismatched, novice crew is ripped straight from the plot of both The Cowboys and City Slickers. The jarring separation between part one and part two of Australia would have made for an appropriate intermission, or two completely disassociated films.

While visual brilliance is clearly the film's strong point, its bizarre transitioning between a wide variety of genres creates an oddly style-confused epic.  The film starts almost like a screwball comedy, with fast-talking arguments between the leads and a light-hearted bar-fight introduction for the Drover.  Once the cattle drive begins, we're immersed in exciting action with stampeding herds and a race to the proverbial finish line.  Shortly after, the film heads into the territory of romance as the mismatched duo fall for each other, and then a brief stint in a public service announcement for the mistreatment and segregation of mixed-race children segues into a war film of the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese.

Australia does manage a gorgeous look, but underneath that deceptive layer of beauty lies a film not too original and not too compelling.  A more precise approach and a steadier tone might have made a finer movie - after all an epic is not defined by length alone.

3755288,1,B001PPGAIK,"It's disappointing that all the one-star reviews seem to be about DVD formats and quality.
This movie deserves to be panned for its sheer corniness.
That said, I could possibly go two stars, for the visual beauty of many of the scenes, especially the Outback, and because the acting is decent  in general, and Kidman is great in some scenes, especially early on.  I found it entertaining for  a while, but it goes on much  too long, getting cornier and cornier as it goes.
Also, in the early part of the film, Lady Ashley just comes way too far too fast.  Probably not the fault of the actress or the director; that's what it says in the script, and there is just too much other stuff in this interminable film to give that subplot the time it needs.

Still, it's just incredibly corny and unrealistic, and racist as hell in some ways.  I'm talking about the Japanese being portrayed as monsters who strafe a crowd of kids and clergy.  The Japanese, and for that matter the English, Americans, and probably the Australians and everyone else, did a lot of evil stuff in WWII, but strafing kids, for no reason?  Probably not, and certainly this incident is made up.
I'm also talking about the Aboriginal medicine man standing on one leg with a spear like a Masai warrior.  Give me a break.
There are an awful lot of unrealistic things in the movie, and OK, the portrayal of aboriginals is favorable, the evils of the Australian assimilation policies are given their due, but come on.

And it needs editing, goes on way too long.  ""Self-indulgent"", it's called in a lot of reviews.
Some people like it, I guess, and that's fine.  I liked it a litte bit, mostly the first hour or so.
On the whole, though, i think it richly deserves one star.",1511913600,,1738,4.514376996805112

I have absolutely no idea of where Baz Luhrmann gained a reputation as a director. This movie doesn't just stink, it reeks of 1920 B grade western claptrap. I am stunned that he did not ask Hugh Jackman to kiss his horse, maybe that would have improved the movie.
The little boy does a fine job at acting given the poor script and low grade director.
Dark Aboriginal magic, horse dung, never would have stopped a thousand head of cattle stomping the kid into mush before becoming a horn and hoof Niagara Falls in the Outback.
If you do have a desire to watch good Aussie outback movies, then look out for work by Chips Rafferty or see if you can find Jedda. The trouble with the last named movie is that it was filmed with a very low budget and part of the film had to re-shot in a location that does not match the rest of the film.",1507939200,,878,4.25748502994012

3755596,3,B001PPGAIK,"My girlfriend really loves Pearl Harbor, which I think is a pretty awful movie that tries to set a romantic love story within a historical setting of World War II.  I described to her that there is a similar film that does everything better and is more enjoyable, and that film is called Australia.  This film has a better story and better acting which nonetheless holds the criticisms of which you would see in a typical Baz Lurhmann directed film.  Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and the rest of the supporting cast do a great job in their roles, and the acting is enjoyable to watch and there is a lot of character they bring to the screen.  The story is great, and has several distinct breaks between each act which all have translating themes.  When you think you've reached a happy conclusion in the middle of the film, the story builds further on and adds more complications between the love interests and the main villain of the film.

I have two criticisms: one being the script takes some liberties behind the history of the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese, which happened BUT there was much unwarranted tension made in the film which could have been written and directed in a different way to have the same effect on viewers.  Also, keep in mind this is a Baz Lurhmann film, which means the first 15 minutes has manic editing and cinemetography which will make you a little bewildered - all because Lurhmann does this during exposition scenes and it feels irritating.  Outside of that, the director does a good job when the scenes settle down and also when there's a lot of action that goes on.  The best scene is definitely when the team of drovers attempt to stop a stampede.  Baz also has developed a good soundtrack for the film and there's a lot of great musical themes that transition through the film - if that's something you enjoy a lot.",1425081600,5,1857,4.566265060240964

3755729,3,B001PPGAIK,"Black memories

""My mother would sit and cry and tell me this; they buried our babies in the ground with only their heads above the ground. All in a row they were. Then they had tests to see who could kick the babies' head off the furthest. One man clubbed a baby's head off from horseback.

They then spent the rest of the day raping the women, most of whom were then tortured to death by sticking sharp things like spears up their vaginas till they died.

They tied the men's hands behind their backs, then cut off their penis and testicles and watched them run around screaming until they died. They killed in other bad ways too."" [4]

The main reasons why Aboriginal people were killed by white settlers were [1]:

  a struggle for land where stockmen often led cattle to graze well beyond the limits of the station
  as reprisals for attacks on white men, cattle or horses
  lack of communication because of linguistic barriers
  for being cheeky (e.g. for being ""found standing in the moonlight in the doorway of [a squatter's] hut"")
  fear of attacks by Aboriginal people (settlers thought Aboriginal people painted for important ceremonies were performing war dances),
  to remove all male Aboriginal people so that white settlers could sexually abuse women and girls.

White settlers found no reason to spare Aboriginal men, boys and children. Aboriginal girls and women, however, were often kept for sexual pleasure. Research uncovered ""stories of girls as young as eight who were kidnapped and raped and infected with syphilis. Teenage girls were kept for sex and chained up at night to stop them running away. One group of girls was held in a chicken wire enclosure."" [1]

  Jack Watson, head stockman at Lawn Hill station in the Gulf country, in 1885 had 40 pairs of human ears nailed to the walls of his hut.--The Age [1]

Some other massacre sites include Appin, Bluff Rock, Slaughterhouse Creek, Waterloo Creek, Pinjarra and Woodford Bay.
Myall Creek Massacre memorial

Location map of the Myall Creek Massacre site The Myall Creek Massacre memorial site is approx. 20 kms out of Bingara and 600km north of Sydney.

Initiatives to erect a memorial on the Myall Creek Massacre site date from as early as 1965. But it wasn't until 1998 that a conference on reconciliation decided to erect a permanent memorial because the participants felt that the `bad history' had to be acknowledged along with the good. The Myall Creek Memorial Committee was formed to carry out the proposal.

  There is a code of silence surrounding the massacres.--Paulette Smith, Myall Creek Memorial Committee [7]

On 10 June 2000 the Myall Creek Memorial Committee officially opened the Myall Creek Memorial.

Ever since the 1980s, annual commemorations recalled the events and remembered both the murderers and the victims of the massacre at Myall Creek.

In 1998 Sue Blacklock, a descendant of an Aboriginal survivor, approached the Rev. John Brown to offer Myall Creek as a reconciliation project. [3]

Coincidentally Beulah Adams, a woman descended from one of those hanged, and Des Blake, descendant of another murderer, also came forward.

Sue acknowledged the courage of Beulah and Des and all felt a strong connection between them. Des told his story in schools--any Australian with ancestors of the `pioneering days' could have similar links to atrocities in the past.

By their coming together these people make Myall Creek an outstanding example of history used to reconcile and restore relationships. Sue, Beulah and Des still meet during the annual commemorations at the Myall Creek memorial site.

  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s I used to think, 'If they could do [the killings] then, they still might'. Deep down I sometimes still think that way... It's sometimes hard to lose the young girl inside.--Sue Blacklock",1408752000,,3821,4.981042654028436

Amazing movie that will touch your heart and brings out the not-so-well-known story of what happened to the Natives of Australia. The only downfall to this movie is the length...just when you think the movie is going to end, it keeps going!!

One, a little too lovey-dovey for my two teenage boys, and the romantic undertone bored them and one even just left the room and said he wasn't interested in the movie, when usually he's more polite/subtle than that. One scene with them in a bed (well, I think two scenes technically in bed, but one scene doing the hankey pankey).

3755782,4,B001PPGAIK,"Hugh Jackman has risen to fame and popularity as the tormented Marvel superhero, Wolverine. One would think that his legions of followers are there to gaze upon his handsome face and see his powerful form in action, but the Wolverine is the product of Hugh's acting talent--always multi-faceted and a blending of the character's positive and negative qualities. This transformative talent makes him totally believable in this very satisfying tale featuring the extreme beauty of Australia. The story is a tribute to the country's much loved cultural icons, and parts of the story loom large as if in fond admiration of them. Jackman portrays Drover, an image of the iconic master horseman and livestock herder of the Outback. He brings this image out of local legend and makes him honest and real--someone you would recognize from your youth as that guy who never started fights but always finished them, yet was a kind, thoughtful and true friend. Nichole Kidman plays Lady Sara Ashleigh, the wealthy, high-born Englishwoman who comes to Australia to bring her husband home, but stays to avenge his death. She is met at the ship dock at Darwin by Drover, who has been hired to drive her to her husband's station, Faraway Downs. This has been arranged by her husband's foreman specifically to scare her off--a delicate society lady who will be disgusted by the Drover's rough manner, high-handed attitude and easy sexuality with the local natives, and it seems to work; she hates the dust, the lack of morality and the apparent brutality of the landscape and the people. We learn that the foreman has been rustling Lord Ashleigh's steers for ""King"" Carney, who owns just about every place but Faraway Downs. The plan is to drive Lord Ashleigh out of business after which the foreman can have the station, which he has coveted since he was a boy and his father was foreman. The foreman will then partner with Carney. The foreman has murdered Lord Ashleigh to hurry the plan along, a fact unknown to Carney. But the evil foreman has judged Sara very poorly. She learns of the plot from the genteel, alcoholic bookkeeper, and when she sees the foreman cruelly beating a very young bi-racial boy for a tiny offense, she angrily orders him off the property. He laughs, and leaves with all the workmen except the Drover, who is his own boss. Sara is determined to stand up to the barbaric injustice she has encountered; she hires the Drover to move the herd to the shipping docks to honor a contract with the English Army, to feed the soldiers fighting in World War II. He thinks she's crazy. Who will he get for herdsmen? Lady Sara says she will ride (we have seen earlier in the film that she is an excellent horsewoman), and she will learn to herd the cattle. We now are introduced to another Australian icon--the brave, smart woman who can work side by side with the men and be their equal. The Drover has always wanted a thoroughbred to breed with the Australian brumbies and she promises him her horse. The two native women who work in the house are experienced herders and they too will ride, plus the alcoholic bookkeeper who admires and respects Sara enough to give up the bottle and help out. They need one more rider and after some thought, choose the little bi-racial boy. It is through this boy that we encounter the mysticism that the Australians revere in their native peoples. The boy, Nullah, is the grandson of a great leader and shaman. We meet the grandfather, called King George by the white people, while he is teaching Nullah the ways and songs of his people. Native songs are magic and history all in one, and the boy learns well. On the trail we learn that Sara's delicate beauty and genteel ways mask her inner strength and sense of justice, and these are revealed as they travel the starkly majestic plains of the wilderness. There is much danger and excitement on the drive, and a clash of wills with King Carney in the town of Darwin. There are brawls, snotty society people and much heroism in the old style of the 1940's and '50's films of Hollywood. This film feels very much like an old John Ford western, where courage and honor were still values to strive for; the people of this 1940's Australia are much like that. Baz Lurman takes what could easily be a simple melodrama and makes it a film of endearing simplicity about the sacrifices people really do make for love.",1402963200,,4399,4.692108667529108

This is the sort of movie (and story) where one should simply sit back, put up their feet, and enjoy the ride. And quite a ride it will be! This is not a movie that will lead to deep, penetrating, philosophical debate. Nor should it. This film is more in the tradition of a Saturday Afternoon Matinee.

The cinematography was outstanding and disk mastering, first rate.  The movie was shot with deliberate dominance of color hues rather than primary colors, and on bluray, these colors are most distinct and vibrant, and the DTS sound give superb separation and wide dynamic range.  Most TV or cable broadcasts the colors are dull and washed out.  Bluray is 1080p while the best HDTV can muster remains 1080i.  Even streaming Netflix falls short as video remains heavily compressed, leading to more muted colors and less sharp outlines.  The finest details of the wooden homes, the water pump, texture of the actor's clothing etc., are all far more distinct.",1392163200,2,710,4.97457627118644

3755832,3,B001PPGAIK,"""Australia"" (2008) presents an interesting study in cinema. It's a wannabe epic Western that takes place in Australia around the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. It's got a good plot, a solid cast (headed by Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), excellent Northern Australia locations, great CGI, loads of drama and a number of thrilling scenes, including those revolving around a massive cattle drive and a Jap attack. The film cost $130 million and runs 2 hours and 45 minutes. But something about it doesn't click; it fails to come together into a cohesive whole. The story's simply not very compelling and the characters aren't that interesting. The best character is a ""creamy"" (half black/half white) boy, but when the Japs attack at the end -- and the aftermath -- I didn't really care what happened.

What went wrong? You can trace it to the fact that I failed to get hooked into the story in the first hour and so I sat there half-attentive and mildly bored throughout the rest. So I guess the problem lies with the writing. The filmmakers have the responsibility of making the characters, their world and their challenges come alive, but they failed. I don't fault the actors, as they did the best they could with what they had and Jackman's always a superlative protagonist.

Lesser problems include an odd tone that's quirky and sometimes semi-goofy, as well as the decision to grace the Aborigines with mystical powers. (Isn't it ironic how, after a couple hundred years of being treated as subhuman savages, Native peoples in the Americas and Australia/New Zealand are now adorned with god-like powers and sage-like stature in cinema?) Although ""Australia"" is essentially an adventure-drama Western, these two factors take away from the believability. So don't expect the realism of historical adventure-dramas like 1992's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" or ""Pearl Harbor,"" rather expect an adventure-drama with a good helping of Indiana Jones. This might sound great on paper (I love Indiana Jones), but it somewhat fails in execution.

Still, it's not bad and there are numerous highlights, like the scenic locations and all-around quality movie-making. I just wish they would've fit an interesting story and characters into the mix.

3755834,5,B001PPGAIK,"A lot of reviews discuss the director, historical correctness, chemistry between the leading roles, however, I'm not a movie critic. Not looking to pick this movie to pieces. I watched it with an open mind. I was looking for pure entertainment, and this is exactly what I got. Hugh Jackman is HOT. Nicole Kidman is funny. Both play fiercely driven, passionate roles, and they play it well. The most refreshing character was that of the bi-racial child, Nullah. He stole the show. He made the movie. I know of no lady who disliked this movie. It's definitely a chic flick. It has everything we enjoy in a movie. Adventure, tragedy, comedy, drama, romance, good versus evil. But this is a little more than a ""romantic"" love story. The spoiled aristocrat follows her husband to his Australian ranch only to find he's been murdered. She inherits more than the ranch. She inherits a staff of mostly indigenous people. She soon falls hopelessly in love with the people, the land, her late husband's cattle drover, and most importantly, this beautiful motherless child. She leaves her aristocratic life behind, struggles through hardship, heartbreak, and racial division, and comes out victorious in the end. I loved it!",1390780800,12,1213,4.980295566502463

Hugh Jackman was spectacular, as he always is, as the ""man's man"" and still charming, caring, charismatic and fully believable as the loner who comes to fall in love. Honestly, I've never been a huge Nicole Kidman fan, the whole ice queen bit being done a bit too well to my taste in a few films but here she is endearing, loving and as caring a mother as one could see. And, I must say, I became a ""Nicole fan"" after seeing this film.

Of course, there are some thieves and swindlers amidst the good guys, and the government's plot to take the Aborigine out of the children. (Why can't we let children alone?

Unfortunately it also has continuity errors as long as your arm, history errors, poor match move and CGI and mistakes that wouldn't be made in film school such as using the black and white 1955 version of Wizard of Oz instead of the sepia tone of the original 1939 movie.  Apparently it was never story boarded so you don't have a story arc, you have a story kangaroo of Donovan's Reef meets The Man From Snowy River while riding past The Rabbit Proof Fence.  It is a tribute to this great cast and the sheer power of the story that even Luhrman's sloppy direction can't ruin a basically enjoyable film well worth re-watching.  You can only be disappointed by what might have been.",1373760000,2,874,4.493670886075949
3755900,3,B001PPGAIK,"Walking into `Australia', I was expecting a disaster.  Despite being a fan of Luhrmann's, I was extremely skeptical of how this film was going to pan out since it was universally panned by nearly all critics and even by fans of the director.  It was seen as a misstep.  I was never really interested in the storyline or the feel of the film.  It just didn't have that same Luhrmann flare that I had grown to admire.

I'm glad I finally saw this.

`Australia' is far from a perfect film.  In fact, it is far from a great film, but it is good and one that, while messy, makes for a satisfying film experience.  The plot follows a woman named Sarah Ashley who travels to Australia to fetch her husband (whom she expects is chasing tail) and sell her land.  She is greeted by the Drover, a rugged and somewhat detached soul who is put off by the dainty Ashley.  When Sarah finally gets to her land she uncovers a dark plot involving a rival cattle baron who is stealing her cattle in an attempt to win over a huge account.  At the end of her rope, Sarah teams up with the Drover and a haphazard crew of drunks and Aboriginal's to drive her cattle through the outback and to victory.

But the film doesn't end there.

My main issue with `Australia' is that it's two halves don't quite gel as fluidly as they needed to.  It is clear that Baz Luhrmann was shooting for an ode to `Gone With the Wind'.  This is clear from some of the film's opening shots and the use of reds in the sky at dusk.  Baz also made mention of that in interviews at the time of the film's release.  The fact that the film takes place in 1939 (although `The Wizard of Oz' is the primary cinematic reference) is another giveaway.  Luhrmann was trying to make a socially important film regarding his homeland, and he manages to create some stirring visuals and connect some important dots, but this plays out like two separate films being squished together in a way that just doesn't work.  Sadly, the film comes off as a tad forced in some areas, as well as a tad repetitive.

The look and feel of the film feels very much like a film Bogart and Hepburn could have made in the 40's, and that is nostalgic and endearing, but the corny dialog and plot points don't always work in a modern world.  I think that may have been a major reason why this is regarded so low by so many.  I don't think many moviegoers were expecting such a vintage feel to a film by Baz Luhrmann.  This is sad, because Luhrmann actually creates a beautiful homage to the classics and it is that aspect of the film that drew me closer and closer to it.

When the film ended I was torn.  It was far better than I expected it to be, and yet again it was extremely flawed.  Flawed, yet exciting and entertaining and, at the end of the day, well worth your time.",1373587200,2,2797,4.269961977186312

3755908,5,B001PPGAIK,"""Australia"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In Australia, on the brink of World War II, an English aristocrat travels to the faraway continent, where she meets a rough-hewn local and reluctantly agrees to join forces with him to save the land she inherited. Together, they embark upon a transforming journey across hundreds of miles of the world's most beautiful yet unforgiving terrain, only to still face the bombing of the city of Darwin by the Japanese forces that attacked Pearl Harbor.

The cast led by Nicole Kidman (as Lady Sarah Ashley) & Hugh Jackman (as Drover) is excellent!

(2001, also wrote the story and screenplay and produced) is excellent! The story by Luhrmann and the screenplay by Luhrmann, Stuart Beattie (who also wrote the screen story to ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"" (2003), also wrote the story and screenplay to ""Collateral"" (2004), & the screenplays to ""30 Days Of Night"" (2007) & the upcoming ""G.I. Joe: Rise Of Cobra"" (2009), Ronald Harwood (who won the Oscar for his screenplay on ""The Pianist"" (2002) and was nominated again, recently, for his work, on ""The Diving Bell And The Butterfly"" (2007), & Richard Flanagan is excellent!

The music by David Hirschfelder (who also did the music to ""Strictly Ballroom"") is excellent! The cinematography by Mandy Walker is excellent!

The casting by Ronna Kress (who also did the casting to ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor"" (2008) & the upcoming ""G.I. Joe: Rise Of Cobra"") & Nikki Barrett is excellent! The production & costume design by Catherine Martin (who also co-produced) (who won Oscars for her costume & production design work on ""Moulin Rouge!""

The art direction by Ian Gracie (supervising art director) (who was an supervising art director on ""Moulin Rouge!"") & Karen Murphy (who was a buyer & set dresser on ""Moulin Rouge!"") is excellent!

3755936,3,B001PPGAIK,"I finally caught up with ""Australia"" on DVD, after deliberately not making much of an effort to see it in theaters a few years back.

It's not all that bad, actually, especially when you watch it at home and can take breaks (to get another glass of wine) several times during the 2 hour and 45 minute (!) running time.  Baz Luhrmann's manic directing style, which worked pretty well for ""Moulin Rouge!"", is pretty distracting during the first half hour, but he eventually settles down and applies his crazy cuts and camera work more sparingly so we can get into the story.

Anyway, it's all big sweeping stuff about cattle and romance and endless vistas and (finally) World War II, and there are actually three or four moments when your emotions will swell when it all comes together.  And the rest of the movie is tolerably watchable, if you take those breaks I mentioned.

It's funny, though.  There's some solemn verbiage at the beginning of the movie about the issue of Aboriginal relocation (sort of Australia's version of how we treated our American Indian population, I think) and a little more verbiage about it at the end, as if the movie wants to convince us that it's really about this dark issue from Australia's past.  It's funny because the very long movie that appears between those two moments of onscreen verbiage is 95% concerned with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman and whether they'll get together, with maybe six minutes (tops!) of the running time devoted to the Aboriginal relocation issue.  I had to laugh.

I will say that the standard DVD I watched had spectacular picture and sound, so this sucker must look and sound really great on Blu-Ray.  Hey, good presentation always helps with those types of long movies (like this one) that never quite make you forget you're watching a long movie.

In the end, let's just call ""Australia"" a tolerable, pretty good movie, no more and no less.  Of course, that assessment might be a tad generous, because if someone told me I was never permitted to see this movie ever again, I have to honestly say that I wouldn't lose any sleep.",1359331200,2,2097,4.699453551912568

3755939,3,B001PPGAIK,"This 2 hour and forty minute epic is a fairly entertaining adventure but filled with spots so cheesy that it's almost painful. The CGI is extremely poor is some spots which took away some glamour because it wasn't even necessary during some scenes to have it.

Hugh Jackman is amazing and is the main reason I'd recommend this film to anyone. His work is as top notch as ever and brilliantly acted throughout this entire saga. Nicole Kidman performs nicely as well but Hugh Jackman just rose above everyone else.

It's hard to say who the target audience was when you go from one scene of over the top happy giddy family moments to fairly intense murders that would be deemed too much for younger viewers but other than a very small handful of scene it almost feels like a family adventure movie more than a sprawling romantic piece.

* It's LONG. It's over 2 hours and feels like it. The first time I tried watching it, I couldn't sit through it. I got up and started doing other things and kept looking over at it thinking, ""Is this thing still going?""
* It's more than one story. There are a few times the story could have ended, but it's covers her story, a bit of his story, and the kid's story, so it keeps going until all three are wrapped up.
* The romance isn't very believable. I can't see these two falling for each other in any sort of real way.

The Good:
* the cinematography is insanely good
* Hugh Jackman. He's scruffy, half naked, and doing manly horse things. Yum.
* The kid, Nullah, is cute and used with wonderful effectiveness.
* The lost generation story. As an American, I know nothing about aboriginal culture. Yes, it's one sided, but it's interesting.
* The grandfather. He says and does so little, but it's hauntingly powerful and lovingly beautiful.

The story follows a British aristocrat wife, who is forced to go down to Australia to see to her interests in cattle ranch.
I found the story lacking in the following areas: failure to have good characters with depth and intrigue that made us feel empathy for them, failure to hook the audience (i.e. me) into the story within the first 10 minutes, and a story that lacked depth in taking the audience on a compelling journey.  And for me, that means certain death for a movie, based on the rules and business of storytelling.
It could have been a very powerful story (I have no doubts that Australia has the history for such stories), hooked the audience, and really taken us on an amazing journey of Australia and made us emotionally invested in the story.
I point to poor writing in character and story development.

3755965,5,B001PPGAIK,"This is a brilliantly executed story about true happenings in Australia including the `missionary work' ~ you know the lies told justifying one's cruelty, racism, horrible acts by saying one is doing God's work which among other things was until 1973 the forcible abduction and removal of Aborigine Children from their families and homes by the ignorant ruling class of Australia; life in Australia for all in pre World War II; language, traditions and growing up as an Aborigine after whites displaced the natives.

The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but it does pull through at the end, though without giving away spoilers, it does uncourageously still make the religious look `good, heroic' like their willing participation and possibly instigation of `saving the heathens souls' by stealing as many native children from their families and homes and imprisoning them in mission schools could in ANY lifetime be considered good work, or the choice of an `intelligent, benevolent, all-knowing being.'

Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman seemed a bit stiff in their roles for the first half of the movie, but did great the second half.

Hats off to David Wenham who did a brilliant job as a hateful, cruel character, I still want to beat the #!%# out of him.

All the aborigine actors did a beautiful job of telling a story from that character's point of view: the woman raped by any white man who felt inclined; the young boy, Nullah who's father was a white ignoramous; the tracker enslaved to the whites; the shaman; and the brother and friend of Hugh Jackman's character.

I haven't read all previous years of previews, nor do I imagine myself as the first to point this odd 3-ending oddity out...however, I found this approach truly unique & well, ""rare"", in the general current movie making mindset. My hat is off to whoever was the final call on this movie's ending.
Viewing it today, I am truly surprised there wasn't more favorable ""critical"" response from the ""critics"" (I.E. bloviated malcontents with no true direction, without the true viewer's perceived pulse nor their affection to current cinema in today's moviemaking wonderland. I.E., hapless idiots living in their own cocoon).
Anyway...
Not a shocker, honestly. I'm sure they're content to sticking with perpetuating the tried-n-tue bile they receive daily from their publishers/reps/managers & other handlers in their line of ""work"". What the hell, they still collect a check in the end.
So yeah, anyway, ignoring the stupid hollywood political garbage, I'd bet that the ""average movie-goer"" will find this movie appealing on multiple levels. There's the ""chick flick"" parts with romance, with the ""guy to the rescue & impending doom"", parts with dust, dirt & danger, plus the ""saving the kid"" parts with well, the happily ever after part...what's not to like??
Jackman, Kidman, the boy & many others performed commanding roles in this movie. You all did an excellent job! You all have my heartfelt gratitude for a job well done! Geez, I'm still blowing dust-boogers from my nose after watching this one. LOL!!",1340409600,,1718,5.074204946996466
3755967,5,B001PPGAIK,"What a marvelous movie! If Australia really is as fascinating as this movie suggests, I really do want to visit. Not Darwin, though, I think. I understand the temperatures there in the summer are pretty outrageous. And I'm not sure I could celebrate the first big storm of the rainy season by running around in the downpour laughing and dancing.

Still this is a great story. As far as I'm concerned, the real star of it is the little kid who is the narrator as well as central character. His name is Nullah, and as he explains right at the start, he's not a black fella, he's not a white fella, he doesn't belong anywhere.

Well, that turns out not to be entirely true. But the government was certainly trying to enforce that concept. They set up ""mission schools"" where the half-caste children were basically taught to act white, and probably to aspire to jobs as servants. Nullah does not want to go. He's happy living on the cattle station where his mother works, in spite of being afraid of the manager who is probably his father and also apparently the murderer of the owner, Lord Ashley. Lady Ashley (Nicole Kidman) arrived from London just in time to find her husband laid out for burial. The murder was assumed to be the work of King George, Nullah's grandfather and a powerful native wizard. Indeed, he has taught Nullah much magic.

One of the things that interests me about Australian movies and books is that they almost always act as if the aborigines' magic is real. Well, perhaps it is.

This is a long movie, 2 3/4 hours long, but you'll never get bored. There are so many threads to the story that it weaves a complicated tapestry before you know what hit you. You can't help loving the main characters, Nulla, Lady Ashley, and Drover. And there are real villains to hiss, as well. Some of them work for the landowner right next to (and virtually surrounding) Lady Ashley's station, and the boss is determined to buy her out for a fraction of what the place is worth. He's trying to get a monopoly on supplying beef for the Army, and a ship is waiting in Darwin's port for the cattle he wants to sell for way too much money. So Lady Ashley, Drover, Nulla, and a minimum small band of assistance drive the cattle to Darwin despite all the odds. They face remarkable perils and have remarkable help, including some of that aborigine magic.

The other significant thread is, quite obviously, the growing romance between Lady Ashley and Drover. All I have to say about that is I totally understand why Lady A found Drover (Hugh Jackman) appealing, and I suppose the gentlemen readers will understand why he found Nicole Kidman desirable. They make a very sweet couple when they get the chance.

But don't forget the government's attempts to kidnap Nullah and try to make a good little Christian peasant out of him. That turns out to have bigger ramifications than it appeared early in the story, even though his mother died to protect him from the ""coppers.""

3755982,4,B001PPGAIK,"I just recently did my first submission of a review and when I came to buy a DVD copy of Australia (I already have the BluRay) I decided to look at some of the reviews and was inspired to write my own.

It's too bad some people didn't 'get' this movie. It's really a throwback & and homage to old time epics like Gone With The Wind, How The West Was Won and the original From Here To Eternity to name a few. There are 3 simultaneous stories going on so that apparently throws people who are used to a quick, blow stuff up and get on with it typical modern movie.

There is the 1. love story of the 2 main character as they meet, get to know each other and help each other transform into a better version of themselves while trying to save her ranch, falling in love and being caught up in the other 2 parts of the story over the course of about 4 years. Next, 2. is the back story of the horrendous treatment of the aboriginals and the story of what came to be known as the ""lost gererations"" where children were taken from their families and raised to be white servants. Then there is 3. the story of Australia's surprising entry into WWII. So when I see people complain that it seems to have too many 'endings', what they don't seem to understand it that there has to be resolution to all three of the story lines. Although the 'lost generations' didn't really get resolved in total until many, many years later, the story of the one boy was resolved, the love story did the usual resolution...boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and they both become better people. And, of course the war story goes from early rumblings and local war talk in the newspapers, rallying the people in support of Great Britain and on to the surprise that most people didn't even know about so I won't spoil it here.

Anyway I feel sorry for people who  don't appreciate the epic aspects of this film. Is it perfect? No! The editing definitely could have been better and there are some continuity issues. My biggest issue, and the reason for less than 5 stars, was the way it was edited, especially the ending.. This doesn't take away from the story, acting or cinematography so wasn't bad enough to spoil my love of the movie. Most of the other negative comments by other people just don't fly for me. I thought the cinematography was spectacular, the music was beautiful & appropriate. The costumes were very good and very much fitting to the period & the people and the story was well done.

3755984,4,B001PPGAIK,"If you like action and adventure on an epic scale, with an opposites attract love story with beautiful people, set against a huge canvas that includes the outbreak of global war, Australia (2008) may just be the ideal movie for you.  The film is massive in scope, with beautiful cinematography, and action that is capable of exploding with earth shaking consequences.  This is big time filmmaking at grand proportions that captures your attention, featuring Nicole Kidman as Lady Sarah Ashley, a widow in a strange new land, battling to save what is left of her fortune.  Spanning 165 minutes, there may be even a little too much story, as the adventure extends to include the Japanese attack on the continent in December 1941.  A tale of tragedy and triumph, Australia certainly delivers a big bang for your buck.

The film opens with intrigue as, Lord Maitland Ashley the owner of the cattle ranch Faraway Downs is killed with a native spear while out on the range.  Lady Sarah has only just arrived from England, and after burying her husband, she finds that she has a ranch about to go under on her hands.  Ranch manager Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) has been stealing cattle, and trying to drive Faraway Downs into the ground, so that King Carney (Bryan Brown) a neighboring rancher can eventually take over.  Fletcher is fired after Nullah (Brandon Walters) an aboriginal boy informs Lady Sarah of the true situation, setting in motion the conflict that will propel much of the film.  With little choice, Lady Sarah turns to Drover (Hugh Jackman), to help drive her cattle across the countryside, so they can be sold at Darwin.

The setup is familiar, as the cultured ""Mrs. Boss"" finds herself in a man's world dealing with situations requiring determination and physical strength.  Refusing to quit, she has no options but to depend on her staff, and an apparently crude individual of questionable character.  With her pale completion, native Australian Nicole Kidman looks the part of an Englishwoman completely out of her element.  With the physique of a Greek god, fellow Australian Hugh Jackman makes for one of the most dashing of outback cowboys.  As Lady Sarah learns the ways of the drove and braves the rigors of the outback, her romance with Drover is predictable, but probably sure to satisfy most romantics.

What may be less familiar, are elements of Australian culture that play significant roles in the drama.  This includes prejudice against indigenous people, and the relationship between Nullah and his grandfather King George (David Gulpilil), who is suspected of killing Lord Ashley.  Also important are the spiritual elements related to aboriginal life.  King George is a ""gulapa"", a magic man, who helps the group cross the ""Never-Never"" desert.  Lady Ashley develops a special relationship with Nullah after he loses his mother.  Fletcher, Nullah's biological father, is the cause of much tragedy and hardship.

A tale of struggle, sacrifice, survival, and love, Australia is a throwback to classic American Westerns, with some feel good Disney-like touches, and a uniquely Australian supernatural element.  The voice of Nullah narrates at points, providing some perspective as the story unfolds.  The special effects and CG green screen tricks more commonly a part of action films, are featured quite prominently here.  The cattle stampede sequence is one of the most impressive examples, as is the attack scene by the Japanese.

The acting is quite good, given that the film is something of a romantic fairy tale.  Nicole Kidman shows great range in a strong performance.  Drover isn't given a lot of depth, but Hugh Jackman's performance is exactly what is called for.  The huge diverse supporting cast, apparently features a large number of native Australians, which along with the period costumes, helps give the film a realistic look.  Young Brandon Walters, makes and impressive acting debut, where somehow despite his youth, he manages to convey in his eyes, wisdom beyond his years.  David Gulpilil, perhaps most known for his iconic role in Walkabout (1971), doesn't say much, but as in that previous film, communicates much by his actions and presence.

Writer/director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) does perhaps overreach by including the war story, and the film gets too melodramatic in the final act.  Still, Australia mostly holds your interest, taking on some surreal aspects in the aftermath of the attack.  This tour de force adventure/drama, is one should touch your heartstrings.  The only real disappointment is that lack of significant extras on the DVD release.  At this time, an upgraded full featured version would seem to be overdue.",1301097600,,4686,5.0890052356020945

Major factors shaping this continent nation have been the outback with its huge sheep and cattle stations, and WW2 when a Japanese invation was a serious threat.

3755988,3,B001PPGAIK,"`Australia' is a film that is not quite sure of what it is. Starting off as a comedy with lots of typical Baz Luhrmann style direction, it then changes tack to become a more serious story of life travelling through the outback, with a hint of romance thrown in for good measure. The first half of the film follows Nicole Kidman, as Lady Ashley, who inherits her husbands cattle ranch and sets off to take the cattle to Darwin with the assistance of Hugh Jackman as the cattle drover. They are harassed and persecuted the whole journey by an unscrupulous rival and his henchman. The second half looks at their life afterward during the war. That is the story in a nutshell and it manages to keep you relatively interested for the duration, despite it's length and overblown direction. In fact it would have been better if it was shorter and focused just on the first aspect, with a few of the later loose ends tied up, instead of adding the extra hour of unnecessary storyline. This is quite corny in places (which is becoming a trademark of Luhrmann) and whilst the sweeping landscapes and overhead shots may look impressive, you get the feeling by the time you are half way through that this is a glorified promotional film from the Australian tourist board. There is a distinct lack of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman and both of their accents (plummy English lady and salt of the earth Aussie bushman) start to grate by the end. In fact the best actor has to be the aboriginal boy who travels with them on the cattle drive and he carries off an impressive performance. Saying all that, this is a watchable film and despite it's flaws it still enjoyable, although at this length it really is a film you'd only watch once.

3756006,3,B001PPGAIK,"Australia is the story of a well-bred but meddlesome English woman Lady Ashley (Nicole Kidman) who decides to go to Australia to check up on her husband's affairs there. When she arrives, she is met by a rough bachelor called Drover (Hugh Jackman) who takes her to her husband's property, only to discover that he has been killed. The murder is blamed on the natives, but Lady Ashley quickly finds that something is afoot with the cattle boss (David Wenham) and she promptly fires him.

Without someone to drive her cattle, Lady Ashley is forced to care for the land herself, and she must make a quick go of it. She becomes ""Miss Boss"" to the natives, and her forceful nature and womanly touch makes her a better candidate for the job than one might have first expected.

The story is long and very predictable. It is obvious that most of the auxiliary characters will die, and the storyline doesn't make these deaths very surprising. The author wanted us to feel sad, but not in such a way that would affect the story too much.

The scenery is beautiful, but that doesn't make a film great. Aside from that, the best part of the film is Brandon Walters who plays the makeshift son of Lady Ashley and Drover. The old adage about kids in film seems true here. Although Kidman and Jackman are well known for their acting skills, this boy steals every scene from them. He is charming, intelligent, and his lingo is very entertaining. He is an Aboriginal boy, and an incredibly talented one at that.

3756007,5,B001PPGAIK,"""Australia"" could almost have been released as a duology: not only is it almost three hours long, but it has two genuine climactic moments (I'll get to that presently).  It begins in 1939, just as World War II is getting underway and Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to Australia to bring home the husband she hasn't seen in an unspecified length of time.  Lord Ashley has been developing a stock ranch, Faraway Downs, which is encircled on three sides by the holdings of local beef baron ""King"" Carney (Bryan Brown), and he turns up dead--supposedly murdered by an aboriginal shaman known as King George--on the very day Sarah arrives.  When she realizes that her husband's station manager Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) isn't quite what he claims to be, she fires him, then finds herself crewless and teams up with rough-and-ready Great War veteran Drover (Hugh Jackman) and his two aboriginal riders, Ivan and Magarri (the latter in fact the brother of Drover's late wife) plus a ragtag trail crew--her Chinese cook, an aboriginal woman, a hard-drinking accountant, and King George's 10-year-old half-caste grandson Nalla (Brandon Walters)--to get 1500 head of cattle to the port of Darwin.  If she can succeed, she'll nail down a hefty Government beef contract--but Fletcher first stampedes her cattle, then poisons the waterholes on her route.  Now the only chance Sarah & Co. have is to drive across the Never-Never desert, guided by King George.  Of course they succeed, and thereby hangs the first climactic scene.  Then the story shifts from Western/romance to war story/drama as Sarah and Drover struggle to reconcile with each other's very different personalities and priorities, keep Nalla out of the hands of the government assimilation program, and survive the Japanese air attack that follows the Pearl Harbor tragedy--and hence the second.

Many critics seem to consider the movie high camp, but I found it entirely enjoyable (despite a slightly ambiguous and unsatisfying ending) as a serious tale of adventure, jealousy, greed, love (not just the romantic kind: Nalla clearly develops a deep attachment to ""Mrs. Boss,"" as he christens Sarah, and to Drover), and determination, with elements of several major film genres.  (It's a great pity no one seems to have done a novelization; I'd have liked to have seen what a good adapter could do with the characters' backgrounds.)  It's the kind of movie that makes you realize (much as did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quigley-Down-Under/dp/B00005LOL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quigley Down Under</a>) that the U.S. wasn't the only country that ever had a Frontier Experience--and that Australia's was in many ways similar.",1282608000,3,2740,5.395784543325527

3756009,3,B001PPGAIK,"Despite all the poor reviews by critics, I wanted to give ""Australia"" a try. Overall I enjoyed the movie but it definitely has flaws and I don't feel it has much replay value for me. The visual presentation was well done; however, the writing - and at times the acting - was a little over-the-top.

The movie has three main parts - it starts out as a Western, switches to a romance, then finally becomes a war film. For the most part the transitioning works and the variety makes for an interesting movie. This also helps it not feel like a long movie despite being over 2.5 hours. My favorite part was the Western. Sarah (Kidman) arrives in Australia to see what her husband is up to, only to find him murdered. With the help of the Drover (Jackman) and other outcasts from society, Sarah has to drive the cattle from her husband's estate to the coast for sale. There are dangers along the way, mostly set by Fletcher (David Wenham), who used to work for her husband but really works for ""King"" Carney, the rancher out to monopolize the cattle industry.

The romance part centers on Sarah's relationship with Drover and Nullah, a half-Aboriginal child whom they adopt as their own. Nullah's grandfather is ""King George"", the local magic man. Nullah tended to get annoying at times, saying the same things over and over again. Kidman and Jackman do make a nice couple though. Since Nullah is half-Aboriginal and half-Caucasian, he is an outcast and is soon taken from them; Sarah does everything to get him back.

Finally in the third part, World War II comes to Australia in the form of Japanese planes which attack the port where Sarah has stayed to get Nullah back. Drover is off on a long cattle drive related to the war effort when the attack occurs, so his help is late in coming, if at all.

The acting is just okay, nothing outstanding. I think part of this is from the writing, which came across as rather melodramatic and forced at times. The Australian landscape was very picturesque, especially during the cattle drive. It was the proper backdrop for the epic which the movie wanted to be, and sometimes succeeded at. In essence, if you are looking for a beautiful melodrama, this movie is for you.",1278979200,2,2210,4.601522842639594

I love how the main characters had love, affection and care for each other.  I loved that they strived to make a bad situation work.  Nolah was such a brave boy and he was ever looking forward to what needed to be done next while dealing with the problems at hand.  Nolah was the kind of son I would want if I had one because he was brave, engaged, hopeful, etc. in the movie.  Being single and having assets that you are responsible for is like Nicole had a homestead that she had to take care of and needed a good man's help.  All the pieces came together and she pulled off what her significant other had wanted to have done - drive the big bloody cattle into the big bloody metal ship.  Racial issues played a factor and class separation had an influence.  Lies were told, deceit was hidden yet revealed before it was all said and done.  Many of todays issues existed back then.

3756013,4,B001PPGAIK,"I had low expectations for this film, but I must say I enjoyed it in spite of myself. Part Western and part War in the Pacific, there is something for everyone: romance, sweeping landscapes, cattle drives, stampedes, bush fires, a slice of history with Zeros attacking the port-city of Darwin [These war sequences were especially effective.], and a strong dose of magical realism. Hugh Jackman is the perfect handsome brooding hero, and, as the movie progressed, Nicole Kidman became a splendidly intrepid, if predictable, heroine. The young indigenous Australian boy, always under threat of being relocated, was engaging enough to gain one's empathy. I also found the wide range of ethnic ""cowboys"" to be particularly interesting.

If the film had a weakness, I would say that it fell into two categories, characterisation and moral message: The villain was unrelentingly villainous (to the point of cliche, gnashing his teeth and glaring at the heroine). Furthermore, the respectable citizens of seemed a bit too obviously snooty to be credible.  Finally, the moral was laid on with a rather heavy trowel (The ""No Place Like Home"" scenes from the Wizard of Oz, and the playing of Elgar's ""Nimrod"" when the boy regains his heritage as he goes on walkabout at the end of the film seemed engineered to set the tears spilling down one's cheeks).

Nevertheless, with the Blu-Ray technique, which enhances the spectacular cinematography, this Australian ""Western""-cum-World War II film presents a worthwhile several hours of viewing. Definitely worth watching!",1276128000,,1556,5.266129032258065

His hero (Hugh Jackman) and heroine (Nicole Kidman) have an undeniable chemistry and it is fun to see their characters predictably come together. Hugh Jackman portrays his character with effortless vulnerability that is a joy to watch.  The child star, Brandon Walters, is enchanting.  His eyes are so soulful.

I've gotta give it two stars because it looks so good and because Kidman and Jackman do their best with the cliches they are required to recite from the vapid script.  This film is inordinantly long and you will find that after two hours you are very much ready for it to end.  Unfortunately it has almost another hour to go.  It lurches drunkenly between bad comedy and tearjerker melodrama in the space of 5 minutes leaving the viewer wondering just what sort of film he is watching.  Actually this is two films, with the first 90 minutes being devoted to a very dull but attractively photographed cattle drive and then switching gears to become an examination of racism in 1940's Australia.  And did I mention that the first half hour of the film is a comedy?  You may not remember the comedy so much after the Japanese Air Force attacks Australia and bombs a childrens home though. You may also wonder at all the magical mystical powers on display from the indiginous folks in the film. There is also a weird little kid who plays harmonica, has an obsession with the WIZARD OF OZ and (from the sound of his voice and pronuciation) will apparently grow up to be JarJar Binks.  There is simply too much going on in AUSTRALIA for one film to handle and too many different shifts in tone.  The story is simply a series of cliches and stereotypes and ""movie"" situations.  In short, the film is awful from start to finish. Beautiful photography and costumes, along with Hugh Jackmans insanely buff bare chest are not enough to make AUSTRALIA entertaining.

3756030,2,B001PPGAIK,"Then watch this movie.

I saw trailers for it, and it looked pretty good, so I decided to rent it. And wow. Just... wow.

I generally like Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman movies, but this one was a screw up, and I don't say that a lot about movies. It begins in a confusing swirl, with a cliche, overly-done beginning and the strange story of the mixed boy narrating it. The movies looks like a romance slash thriller, but it feels like the director was so ambitious to mix everything together, it just came out as a garbled mess. There's too many characters, and too many storylines, weaving in and out of it.

The story feels confusing, and unrealistic from the start. The ""bad guys"" are weird, petty little men who just get caught up in this sad excuse for a movie; the lead roles are boring and their accents made me crazy. Everything feels as brittle and cheap as its CGI. Let me say, the stabs the director and writers made at drama (such as the cow-stampede scene, and the part where the fat man gets trampled... wow, that made me laugh my butt off), romance (Nicole and Hugh's characters are drunk when they first kiss... true romance? NOT), humor (What beautiful creatures... CRACK... dead kangaroo), and suspense (when all the mixed children survived the Jap shooting, I was like, REALLY?) ... well, let's just say it came off badly. Not to mention to bizarre story including the mixed boy's grandpa, who pops up and follows everyone like a little creepy stalker... he never really talks, and he kinda reminded me of Rafiki from the Lion King, you know?

And it goes on for way too long, with what feels like multiple endings. Each character flits in and out of the story without much presence, and I found myself willing at least one character to be killed off so the movie would end. It literally feels endless, like the director had so many ideas he got carried away.

I could go on and on, but you get the idea. It's so full of cliche, cheesy, sickeningly flimsy, stupid parts that... honestly, if this was to be a good movie, you'd have to trim it down so that only fifteen minutes were left. I am dead serious, it was a waste of my time. My eyes still kinda hurt from watching it for so long.

So if you're bored and really are wondering what this movie is about? Watch it. But don't even dream of spending twenty bucks on this movie, it's quite a failure. A big disappointment, by my standards, because it had so much potential, and I wanted to like it... but my feelings are mixed, and really, I just can't say I enjoyed spitting away nearly three hours on this movie.",1265241600,2,2585,4.443037974683544

I loved Moulin Rouge (infact I've probably watched it more than any movie I've ever seen), so to the review, the love epic that is 'Australia' has it all, a great opening, spectacular scenery, fantastic actors, an enjoyable story line, engaging chemistry between the two leads, and a whole lot more.
The critics were very unkind to this movie, disgraceful infact that it was so pilloried by so many. Why should relationships between people be depicted as perfect in any movie, afterall the notion of a perfect relationship is ridiculous, some gentle escapism, entertainment on a grand scale, love, pathos, action and some emotional spikes
are all aspects of another Baz Luhrmann movie success. I hope he continues to create movies in his style, he doesnt need any tall poppy criticism, just support and love for his craft.",1263340800,,1388,4.716049382716049
3756035,5,B001PPGAIK,"I'm a sucker for sweeping epic, romantic, drama-ridden, war movies. This makes me easy prey for the seduction of ""Australia"". Set amid the dramatic backdrop of the world's largest island, the movie centers around Lady Sarah Ashley (played by Nicole Kidman whom I have a special attatchment to for thanks to her husband) and her cattle herder known as ""The Drover"" (played by the masculine Hugh Jackman). As Sarah tries to take over her dead husband's ranch in the outback, she is met with numerous obstacles including a corrupt cattle king who is seeking to monopolize the cattle industry, and her ranch manager who is secretly working for her opponent. I must say that David Wenham, who plays her traitor manager, does very poorly at his role. He's just too apparantely evil and sniveling. He was much better in 300. But anyways, Sarah must enlist the help of the Drover if her ranch is ever to survive and soon an improbable romance is ignited. But the gem that really sparkles in this film is the little aboriginal boy that Sarah decides to adopt in order to keep him safe from the government who exports the ""half cast"" children. But when the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor stage an air raid on Darwin, their worlds are all torn apart. I won't say any more because I don't want to ruin it for you. The ending is a little cliche but overall it was a good story. The two leads do a fantastic job together. I was especially impressed with Kidman who lended both humour and pathos to her role. The score was very good, using Over the Rainbow as one of its themes. The cinematography was stunning and effective. Even though it runs almost three hours long, I would encourage you to see it to form an opinion for yourself. You may not be blown away like I was.

I really wanted to like Hugh Jackman but he was just there for scenery and didn't contribute much to the film.  There was absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Jackman.

Of course, there are villains--no good story is complete without them--and they are a driving force behind the plot and storyline. But the life of the movie are the unlikely trio who find a family and sense of belonging with each other. However, I cannot quite make up my mind about this film. It really seemed like it was done by two different directors. The first half of the film was light, quirky and relied much too heavily on computer enhancements to naturally breathtaking landscapes. Through the entire first half of the film, I could not believe that this was the grand, dramatic epic that was raved about. But, over an hour into it, the picture finally hits its stride and becomes a sweeping epic--the characters gain depth, the story has heart and Australia comes to life.

3756049,5,B001PPGAIK,"OK, it's long, and filled with pretty people in a desolate setting. Baz Luhrmann's loving tribute to his homeland isn't as bad as the critics would have you think. Aside from the pretty people (Kidman, Jackman), there's an amazing performance from young Brandon Walters, who not only narrates the film but gives a very complete performance of discovery, angst and renewal, and ultimate discovery. Yeah, there's a love story, but the loving care regarding the kid sort of supercedes a lot. This was smart. Mr. Luhrmann is prone to visuals, and the sets and costumes, as well as the lovely cinematogrphy of Mandy Walker, are all excellent. Indeed, attention to period detail is perfect, as one like I could only imagine. Kidman and Jackson are good, but David Wenham was especially evil, a fine performance. I hated him very much. A film with Baz' name wouldn't be  proper without the magical use of music, most properly adapted by David Hirschfelder. I thought this film was better than the critics thought. Aside from the usual expected from Luhrmann, the performance of young Brandon Walters is reason enough to give this film credibility.  The one thing I don't understand is why, when they knew Darwin would be attacked, nobody did ANYTHING to protect themselves or fight back. That made no sense to me. Especially sending the children to the island, which they knew would be the first to be bombed. Racism and Christians. They go together...at least back then...

3756052,5,B001PPGAIK,"I did not see this in theatres on release as the trailers made it look like a big, overly wrought romance... a la Gone with the Wind meets Cimarron and not my cup of tea. Nor am I a fan of Nicole Kidman, so no appeal there. And when I finally saw it, I found it nothing like I expected nor was it much like many of the other reviewers have portrayed. Yes, it used broad, almost stereo-typed characters to carry the ""Anglo"" story line, and yes, there were actions in the movie that required the ""willing suspension of disbelief""; that hardly seems unusual.

However, the thing that made the movie unusual in a most positive way was the telling of the story from the point of view of the racially-mixed ""outcast"" little boy, Nullah.  This introduced an entirely different point of view, signficantly, at least for Americans, of the characters and the story line.  While I do not pretend to know much about aboriginal culture, the concepts and importance of ""singing"" and ""stories"" were presented sufficiently well to open up the ideas to the large portion of the American audience which likely is unfamiliar with this.  A number of strong and appealing cultural ideas were referenced or illustrated either in the dialog / actions of the aboriginal characters or occasionally the brief comments of ""The Drover"": the geographical mapping of the aborigines through ""singing"" (music); the importance of one's story and how one connects to the ""tribe"" / ancestors / universe through ""singing"" (stories).  In fact, the word ""sing"" as used by Nullah and The Drover in the movie clearly has a richer meaning in this aboriginal context, one which cannot easily be translated directly into American English and which is worth exploring.

I thought Jackman did well in a role that called for a man's man--in American movies cowboys are not too chatty, either...men of action, mostly defined by showing up and doing, so I remain puzzled that other reviewers thought Jackman was too silent. However, the actors that stole the show were the aboriginal actors.  Uncle George was marvelous and mystical throughout--totally elegant, grounded, and convincing as the shaman ""singing"" (guiding with knowledge) his charges through the desert.  The Drover's brother-in-law was excellent, playing his role with a quiet dignity.

But this movie was Nullah's story, from beginning to end, and the beautiful Brandon Walters is a revelation as to what a pure talent can produce when given the right chance; for that we can thank Mr. Luhrmann's effort to get that key role right. I do not know who actually did the singing (humming, chanting) which seemed to eminate from Nullah--if it was dubbed or done by Brandon Walters.  But this movie has indelibly burned in my mind the earnest, trusting face with huge brown eyes in  and the pure, musical tones of the child-mystic when Nullah utters this simple line (and variations on it): ""I sing you to me.""  For this line alone, whether taken as a simple plot facilitator or as a greater metaphor, I would see this movie again and again.",1257120000,103,3053,4.872586872586872

On the other hand, the movie was a combination of predictable and unbelievable.  A child and an English lady...almost miraculously...turn out to be great drovers and, working alongside the leading man, bring 1,500 head of cattle to market despite pursuit by baddies who stampede the herd and even poison water wells.  The film is also totally Hollywood and politically-correct.  Australia, it seems, is eaten up by racism...except, that is, for our leading man and leading lady.  The racism theme is used time and again in the movie.  Our hero, heroine and the aborigenes are noble.  Predictably, almost everyone else, isn't.

In case anyone misses the point, the heroine's [Kidman's] husband or father [I missed the first few minutes] has been murdered by an aborigene spear...but, as we learn to our politically-correct relief, the weapon was really a decoration wielded by a white bad guy.

3756055,2,B001PPGAIK,"What can I possibly add besides what has already been written?  I imagine only my perspective but here it is:

I thought this movie felt like a poorly written overblown knock off of many films, including Far and Away.  It seemed to me that Nicole Kidman was trying to recapture some aspects of her character in Far and Away.  She failed miserably, in my opinion.  In fact, I believe that despite her natural talent, she missed the mark entirely in this movie.

Hugh Jackman IS an excellent actor but he was sadly too silent in this film.  In my opinion, this hurt the movie as well as his credibility as an actor to allow Nicole Kidman or even the Half Caste boy to overshadow him.  While Nicole Kidman seems to be scrambling to recapture her lost past or better days, Hugh Jackman seemed to be gagged.  I have to wonder if this was written into his character because he was starring opposite Nicole Kidman or if the writers just didn't know what to do with such a versatile actor?

The story?  I felt as though I was being preached at.  As though I were a half caste boy being dragged away to the ""lock lock,"" I was being sermonized for almost three hours about how evil certain ethnic groups are.  If the mission's job was to ""breed the black out of them"" as the minister said to Nicole Kidman, then this movie seemed to have a very political agenda to breed any free thought out of its viewers.

Before you say, ""Racist!!!"" and cover your eyes and ears, I would say that one of the best (and most underspoken and underwritten) characters was Hugh Jackman's brother-in-law.  The actor playing him had one really great dialogue on the island ""lock lock"" that stuck with me long after the tripe Nicole Kidman has since past from my system (thankfully).

If the goal of this movie was to let people know how bad things were for the aboriginal people of Darwin, Australia, then they failed for the most part.  It was too sedate and too unconvincing.  Ivan saying, ""No Boongs!"" but then letting the brother-in-law in (I wish I could remember his name; sorry) to have a drink actually came off flat.  If Ivan had remained adamant that no aborigine could come in, even in the midst of their impending deaths, THAT would have really said something to us all about how straight-jacket-like were the caste restrictions and ethnic bigotry.

In all, the movie was so overblown that one rightfully expected ""the wet"" to come.  But it never did.  This movie was flat and failed to do anything but show that even with top notch actors, a big budget and all the trimmings including a plethora of good material,  it can fail to deliver anything but sub-standard dreck.

3756062,3,B001PPGAIK,"**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

Germaine Greer, writing in the UK Guardian, lambasted 'Australia' for sanitizing the true history of the 'Stolen Generations', the forced removal policy of 'half-caste' Aboriginal children by the Australian government. Greer mainly objects to the depiction of how the Aboriginal workers would have really been treated at a place like Faraway Downs, the 10,000+ acre ranch run by Lady Ashley. She finds it absurd that ""a staff of no more than eight: a disloyal manager, a drunken accountant, three Aboriginal cattle hands, two Aboriginal women and a Chinese cook,"" could run such a vast enterprise as Faraway Downs. But even worse, the Aboriginal workers should have been shown to be basically indentured servants, living in ""humpies', filthy shelters ""with no clean water, no sanitation and no electricity."" Greer is equally incensed about the idea that Lady Ashley and Hugh Jackman's 'Drover' are sympathetic characters who do not represent the way the typical Australian treated the Aboriginal population. ""If white Australians had shown parental feeling towards mixed-race children, generations of them would not have had to be removed from Aboriginal communities by successive governments."" Greer misses the point about what director Baz Luhrmann was trying to do with characters such as Lady Ashley and The Drover. They represent a grafting of a modern sensibility on to the historical period in which the film takes place--a sort of projection of the way things could have been. The characters are not meant to be realistic but Luhrmann's way of atoning for the sins of the past. We see the same strategy in recent German cinema and literature (Atonement and Downfall are two examples) where there is always a set of 'good' characters to balance out the legacy of a genocidal past. Quite the contrary, Luhrmann is constantly reminding us throughout 'Australia' of the past poor treatment of the Aboriginal population. He's much more successful in low-key scenes such as when Nullah is being taunted by a Caucasian boy as he's shipped off to the Mission Island than the depiction of the stereotyped upper-crust Darwin socialites (are they all bigots?).

Australia's 'First Act' needs a thorough fix-up. A good 20 to 30 minutes should have been cut from the beginning of the film. In addition to its length, the films' scenarists couldn't decide how to depict their Lady Ashley character. I think what they were going for was obvious: a straight-laced aristocratic type along the lines of Katherine Hepburn's determined missionary in 'The African Queen'. Instead we're offered up a childish and ditsy gal without a back story. Why should we care for Lady Ashley when we first we meet her? She's made out to be ridiculous for the first half hour (Ashley's utter goofiness reaches its apotheosis in the scene where The Drover flings her luggage all about during the fight with the bar patrons and she has a meltdown after her undergarments are spread around all over the muddy street). Luhrmann could do well to come out with a new 'Director's Cut' by shortening the opening act, making Lady Ashley less foolish, inserting a better musical score and generally making Act I less comic in tone.

Kidman redeems herself with the break into Act 2. That's where she strikes the evil Fletcher with a whip and orders him off the ranch. From then on it's smooth sailing for Kidman who suddenly has morphed into the brave heroine she's supposed to be. Hugh Jackman does a fine job as the Drover, the outsider who aids Ashley in her quest to save her late husband's ranch. There's a nice buildup to the midpoint where Fletcher and his confederates attempt to thwart the cattle drive by setting multiple fires in the 'never never' leading up to Nullah almost being forced over the side of a cliff. Greer feels that Nullah and his grandfather, King George, especially in the scene where the cattle magically stop moving forward, are invested with 'superhuman' powers and hence that's demeaning to Aboriginal culture. Greer wants more 'developed' characters and perhaps she should see 'Rabbit Proof Fence', a more historically accurate account of the 'Stolen Generations'. Perhaps Luhrmann is putting his Aborginal characters on a bit of pedestal but he never demeans them--quite the contrary he admires the core of that culture which emphasizes a bond with nature as opposed to the other forces which seek to destroy it (there's a great shot of King George walking impassively, searching for the lost Nullah, as the Japanese zeros bomb Darwin from overhead).

While Luhrmann has created stock characters of Hollywood epics, the strength of 'Australia' is in the plot. In the second half of Act 2, the action builds to a dark ""all is lost"" moment. Luhrmann makes clever use of the year the story begins, 1939, by alluding to two famous pictures from that year--The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. 'Over the Rainbow' figures prominently in the story as Nullah seeks some way to reach his true 'home' and the Drover feels much like an updated Clark Gable especially when he appears at the ball clean shaven and then sweeps Lady Ashley off her feet. I was not completely convinced how easily Fletcher went from being a lowly ranch hand to taking over King Carney's position (handled rather quickly in a fleeting montage) but it makes sense for him to kidnap Nullah and his grandfather after Lady Ashley rejects his demands to sell Faraway Downs.

'Australia' has several 'all is lost' moments with the Drover believing Lady Ashley has died in the Japanese bombing along with Nullah and the kids seemingly lost on Mission Island. Luhrman ties things up nicely by having King George save Nullah from a deranged Fletcher who blames Lady Ashley for the death of his wife. Australia is a true epic which could use some judicious cutting. Purists will bemoan the anachronisms but this is still a film with its heart in the right place.",1254096000,7,5958,4.977911646586345

Australia makes an appealingly quirky 85 minute movie, as Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman team up to drive their cows to Darwin, but then unfortunately there's still 80 more minutes before the movie ends; it samples various subplots (The Japanese attack! Well-meaning but out-of-place criticism of Australia's treatment of its native peoples!) without ever finding a narrative thrust to match its first half, and all the well-shot scenes of carnage and destruction can't change the fact that this is one big jumbled mess of a film.

What drew me to the film in the first place was the gorgeous cinematography I noticed in previews--the storyline looked interesting as well, but I was mainly attracted to the breathtaking landscapes and vivid colors. After my first viewing of the film I fell in love with it: the music is simple yet beautifully and creatively woven into the film; the acting I thought was superb; there are at least three storylines to follow through appropriate tension and resolution; and the cinematography was exactly what I'd hoped it would be after seeing the preview. Since first viewing it a few months ago I've watched Australia four times.

3756083,1,B001PPGAIK,"I love Baz Luhrmann. His vision of Romeo and Juliet was different, yet very refreshing. It translated well to a modern setting, and I've watched it countless times. And Moulin Rouge was not great but it was entertaining.

This, my friend is not.

Yes I love long movies, but on principle- as long as they:

1. Don't Drag
2. Stay entertaining the whole way through
3. Manage to tell the story in a sense in which a shorter runtime would have been a rush job

I enjoyed Watchmen, The Godfather, Dances With Wolves, King Kong 05, and others on that Principle. ESPECIALLY Dances With Wolves. That movie was 3 hours long yet it only felt like 2 hours. When a movie that's over 140 minutes drags, gets boring in some bits, and rely on just being long (The Horse Whisperer, Inland Empire, and the recent Funny People), not a good sign. Australia is one of those movies.

I was so looking forward to this movie- Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman who are two of the best actors, and Luhrmann. I rented it om Blu-Ray the day it came out. ANd then I watched it.

About 96 minutes into the movie I was already checking my wristwatch. THen 140 minute mark, I think it's over. Turns out it's not. 150 minute mark, it's over. 152 minute mark, it's not. 159 minute mark, the credits are finally rolling. Wow, a story so thin and weightless lasted THAT LONG?

The movie is a complete joke, and for several reasons.

First off, this film is basically an extended remake of The Notebook. And while I wasn't crazy about The Notebook either, at least it had good acting and a good plot. This has good acting, but that's where it stops. The plot is confusing and hard to follow.

Second, the length- 3 hours. The same story could easily have been told in two hours or less. But no, Luhrmann had to insert 5 minute shots so he could flesh it out.

Third, the best thing about the movie, Nicole Kidman, was SEVERELY underused. She is a beautiful and undeniable actress, she has the abitlity to pull off any role. But she wasn't used enough.

Oh, and the CGI overdose. This movie is the Die Another Day of Romance films. 60% of all the settings, props, etc. is CG. It's completely distracting.

In short, this is one giant, long, boring, and confusing mess of a movie. Luhrmann should seriously retire before he's ever allowed near a camera again.",1251072000,4,2316,4.462085308056872

Nicole Kidman looks as if she's about to drop from malnutrition (just eat already!) but Hugh Jackman (my favorite actor) does a great acting job AND is major eye candy!  There are tons of handsome actors, but how many of them can really act?  Hugh proves that he's not just a pretty face, but a darn good actor as well.

3756089,4,B001PPGAIK,"Despite the flair for the overdramatic moments, an overly earnest approach, and guilty sappiness, Australia is spirited, has charm and has plenty of heart. There is solid chemistry between Kidman and Jackman as a pair of opposites who have to take a herd of cattle through difficult Australian terrain and ultimately become familiar with the Aboriginal oppression.  I guess I have a bit of a biased view since I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Moulin Rouge and his modern take on Romeo and Juliet, and thought that those films had such a ""larger than life"" feel about them. Luhrmann can take a very simple story and build it up to a grandiose scale, and he does that with Australia, with lush scenery, wonderfully crafted landscapes, and classy storytelling and cinematography. Anyone who enjoys Luhrmann will also love his use of music and songs amid the story, and he does so also in this one, employing a kind of Wizard of Oz theme to it. The song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" comes to be associated with the plight of young Aboriginal boy Nullah, and although it may seem a tad over the top to some, it comes to be the ""song"" that that Nullah sings to Lady Ashley to keep their spirits up. The director seemed to be paying homage to the big epic films of the past, and there is a nostalgic feel while Australia that made it ""work"", at least to me.

If there is one knock against the film, it was its length. At two hours and forty minutes, there are some scenes that just tend to drag on a little too long for effect. For this reason, and while I still liked this film, I would rank it lower than other Luhrmann films. Still, I thought it was a solid rendition of past epics, and overall was a solid production.",1249430400,,1724,4.435331230283912
3756090,4,B001PPGAIK,"Better than the reviews it got, Australia is a charming if quirky portrayal of love and rebellion in World War II northern Australia. Nicole Kidman plays a British widow who takes over her husband's cattle ranch, the only surviving competitor to the nasty monopolist King Carney. Jackman's The Drover is the rugged individualist and friend of Aborigines who helps her fight. David Wenham is the embodiment of pure evil that's the result of capitalist oppression, and the narrator (a ""half-caste"" Aboriginal boy who is learning his grandfather's shamanism) is beautiful both to watch and listen to.

Luhrmann exhibits his quirky directing style in eliciting an almost melodramatic acting style that works under the circumstances. Less successful is his penchant for randomly injecting anachronistic popular music into the action). But he persuasively illustrates the evil of the lust for profit, Marxist class struggles, racism and colonialism that remain part of the Australian heritage.",1248998400,,987,5.493421052631579

Second third of a movie takes a little more serious approach addressing the issue of treatment of bi-racial children and creation of a special class of mixed race population with their role in society clearly defined by the racist notion of ""where they belong"".

3756103,4,B001PPGAIK,"This movie got very diverse reviews, I'm one that really liked it. I felt most of the problems with it were due to the editing and not the actors. Should have been more tightly edited and that would have made the story flow better. Luhrmann set out to film an epic of Australia, but fails in that he covers too much. There were several themes to the movie and following one or two of them would have tightened the movie and made it more watchable.
Kidman and Jackman have chemistry and both of them shine in their roles. I loved their love story. I felt there was a lot of unfair criticism about Kidman's ""stilted"" acting. She was acting the part of a repressed English woman and as the movie went on Lady Sarah loosened up. She was fabulous. Jackman was fabulous as the drover.

3756106,2,B001PPGAIK,"The first half of this monster of a movie was quite enjoyable. It depicts a desperate cattle drive through the desert to the port of Darwin. I thought I was watching an Aussie version of ""Red River."" Nicole Kidman playing the terribly proper English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley winds up on a cattle ranch in the middle of the outback to sort out her dissolute husband -- but finds him dead. She teams up with High Jackman's character, known pretentiously only as ""Drover"" which happens to be his profession. Kidman performs with restraint but Jackson imbues his character with all the realism of a bed knob.
Also involved is an Aboriginal mixed-race child called ""Nullah"" who is likably played by Brandon Walters. Meanwhile the child's father, the evil ""Fletcher"" is working to sabotage the cattle drive so he can take over the land.
The photography of the desert scenary is spectacular and this first half of the movie has a narrative thrust and power that kept me quite enthralled. The cattle drive ends successfully -- and that's where the movie should have ended too. Unfortunately, director Baz Luhrmann is intent on making a major statement about Australian history, racism, the Japanese air raid on Darwin, the nature of love and desire and heaven knows what else. Now we're in another movie -- an Aussie version of ""Pearl Harbor"" mixed with ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" On and on the movie grinds -- the music swells as Luuhrmann presses every emotional button that's available. The central incident in this part of the movie is a Japanese attack on an island where Nullah has been taken to attend a mission school. Japanse troops land on the island determined to kill everyone there. This is entirely fictitious. The Japanese never landed on the island. Drover and his sidekicks mount a daring rescue mission. Everyone is joyouysly reunited and the movie finally takes mercy on its viewers and ends.

3756107,4,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann is a brilliant expositor of his own cinematic vision, and Australia's Blu-Ray release is packed with mini-documentaries, introduced and annotated by Luhrmann, on every aspect of production - from location scouting through set design, cinematography (AND still photography), editing, music direction - indeed, everything EXCEPT casting but with a nice little historical documentary that validates the broad historical elements of the picture. Thus do Luhrmann, the abundantly talented Catherine Martin (co-producer, set and costume designer, and Luhrmann's wife), and other cast and crew have the time and space, courtesy of 20th Century Fox Blu-Ray, to amplify in words and (also High-Def) images  Luhrmann's capacious attempt to capture his country and its experience in film.

I think that, for the most part, he succeeds.

The movie itself divided critics into two camps: the merciless dismissives - who derided Luhrmann as, among other things, a purveyor of kitsch - and the swept-up romantics, who were pulled into the David Lean-esque epic scale and David O. Selznick-style old-fashioned narrative. I number myself among the swept-up. The first obligation of a director, or any one of a film's three or four auteurs - director, producer, writer, cinematographer - is to present moving images that actually grip our eyes and hold them to the screen. At this Luhrmann succeeds wildly - the picture, given its locations, lavish set design, historically accurate costumery, and luminosity of its stars is visually never less than stunning. The action sequences and visual effects fill the screen imaginatively - these Australian cowboys even RIDE differently than John Wayne, Ward Bond, and the whole John Ford gang - and make the 2 hours and 45 minutes literally zip by.

And then there's Brandon Walters, the 13-year-old Aboriginal lad who looks 10 and literally carries away every scene he's in, a rousing, energetic, wholly convincing performance by a stunningly talented (not to mention absurdly photogenic, with eyes as large and expressive as...okay, Bambi's) young man. And credit Luhrmann with eliciting so compelling a performance from a first-time acting novice.

And yes, of course, there's Nicole Kidman and Wolverine, who are just fine, and the welcome return of Bryan Brown to American screens and a nicely evil turn by David Wenham. But this is to me all icing on cake. The film's main, and most riveting, character is Australia itself - the sights, sounds, geological diversity, flora, and fauna. And for most American audiences, this is will be a (welcome) introduction to a spectacular continent and country and a national narrative that, at many points, parallels our own American story.

In particular, Australia will introduce most non-Australian audiences to Australia's national tragedy of The Stolen Generation (for which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized last year). But don't expect perfect historical accuracy - this is a ""Hollywoodized"" past, especially in its idealization of the ""good guys"" a-historical views on race relations  - or profundity. Australia is a historical romance that intends to tug at your heartstrings. In the English-speaking world, the tradition of knuckle-headed stories that pack genuine emotional wallop goes back at least to Shakespeare, who late in his authorial career wrote romances - The Tempest, Pericles, Prince of Tyre, The Winter's Tale - that were deliriously implausible and but deeply emotionally honest. Thus it is with Australia. And only a stony heart will fail to be moved by a wholly predictable, yet emotionally credible, conclusion.

So, yeah, I thought this was a pretty neat picture that, in the context of all those condescendingly dismissive reviews, easily surpassed my low expectations. And placed before me images that I'll scarcely be able to forget.",1245456000,2,3850,5.383720930232558

3756115,3,B001PPGAIK,"Imagine Baz Luhrmann sitting around the Thanksgiving dinner table at the home of one of his Hollywood studio friends.  Stuffed full of turkey, they retire to the media room to watch what has become a Thanksgiving tradition, the classic film Wizard of Oz.  You can almost see the gears spinning in his mind as he reminds his companions that Aussies often refer to their mother country as ""Oz"".  Get it?  Well, if the point appears invisible as a glass-tipped spear, I suggest you witness his latest exercise in cinematic bombast.  Believe me, you'll get it.  Unfortunately, you'll get a whole lot more of it than what you really need.  Oh well, blame it on the Thanksgiving turkey.

Turkey - get it?

The correlation is not half as bad as being constantly reminded of it.  Glass tipped spear, get it?  You know, the set arranged like a rainbow on the mantlepiece, get it?  One spear is missing, get it?  Luhrmann constantly treats his audience like school children who need to be spoon fed the punch line.  Which brings up another irritation of this movie.  What type of audience is this movie geared toward?  Australia is certainly not a family film, there is way too much graphic imagery for any child under age twelve.  The graphic nature contradicts the Disneyesque feel of this movie.  From the very beginning of the boy's narration to the juvenile pop songs that resonate throughout the closing credits, we are led to believe that ""this is the way movies used to be made, when you could take the whole family to the theater and be treated to something larger than life.""

No you cannot - not with this movie.  Unless you are a child sadist.  Or, considering the three hour duration, a masochist.

The plot centers around a boy coming of age; early on in the film, he witnesses first hand an incredible tragedy.  This brings to mind yet another pet peeve found in many films and TV episodes - how can a child (or any character for that matter, not least of which a widow examining her dead husband with a spear through his chest) be traumatized so badly, yet spend the rest of the film behaving like nothing ever happened.  How can people dance and sing across a battleground riddled with corpses?  This is just not realistic.

Not that Australia could ever be considered a realistic portrayal of anything anyway.  The only thing realistic about this movie is the quality of the acting.  Given the absurd context, every actor (to their credit) provides a splendidly memorable performance. Nicole Kidman has never been better - her close-ups are breathtaking. (Although she is one stiff breeze from having her Michael Jackson nose blow right off her face!) Hugh Jackman is rough but irresistably sensitive, his jeans painted on like a ballet dancer.  Brandon Walters gives one of the finest child acting performances in recent memory.

This movie has so much going for it, what a shame to be left in the hands of a Dino DeLaurentis wannabe hell bent on outdoing himself with every scene.  Nothing illustrates this vicious cycle of excess more than the constant barrage of engineered images littered across the stark yet beautiful landscapes.  The cinematographer must have shed many tears over the mauling of his artwork.

""Can't we squeeze another battleship into that harbor. . . let's double the size of that herd. . .  How about another round of Japanese carpet bombing. . .""

Like overindulgence at a Thanksgiving meal, the viewer is left wondering if half as much would have been twice as good.

Baz Lurhmann's previous films were often ""over the top"" (to say the least), yet ""Australia"" feels more serious and more important somehow. There are elements of Luhrmann's humor and sense of wild spectacle, yet overall the film adheres to a more conventional storytelling model, and presents the audience with an intimate look at a vast, often mysterious continent.

Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman are the big names, while a host of aboriginal actors bring to life a culture that has never before been portrayed with such honesty and sensitivity (at least in a U.S. film).

3756119,5,B001PPGAIK,"It's a Baz Luhrman movie, and I honestly don't like everything he's done. I loved ""Romeo and Juliet"", but I completely detest ""Moulin Rouge"". I tried to watch it several times, but I didn't survive the first thirty minutes without desperately wishing he wouldn't waste my time with that crap. (Sorry, fans.)

Okay... I watched ""Australia"" because the trailers made me incredibly curious, and I must say that I stubbornly and shamelessly heart it. To pieces.

Which has a lot to do with my unending love for classical movies, of course. If you try to see Luhrman's movie only as a singular plot and a huge panorama, you might think that the whole thing is sadly overdone. But if you are a fan of movies like ""Red River"", or like ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"", you'll recognize ""Australia"" as what it is: a loving reverence to film makers and directors like Howard Hawks and Mark Robson and Burt Kennedy. Sometimes with a very visible twinkle in the eye (like in the camp scene, when we see Hugh Jackman as the male hero, water running in slow motion over his bare upper body while the heroine - Nicole Kidman - watches him from her tent, with a mixture of fascination and anger. And then the camera takes a very short dip down from Jackman's dripping chest to the spot more than one woman in the audience doubtlessly would die to see. It's only a second, it's a slightly rude joke, and you can see Luhrman giggle in front of your inner eye).

I watched ""Red River"" countless times when I was a child, and when all the good, classical movies were aired on those sleepy Sunday afternoons you best spent in front of the TV. I watched ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" even more often, and I finally bought the DVD a few years ago. I laughed my a... off about ""Support your local Sheriff"" (with James Garner), and all of that doubtlessly makes me an ideal candidate for ""Australia"".

The story is told by the Aborigine boy Nullah (wonderful: Brendan Walters in his very first role ever), and it begins with a mysterious murder. The child spends some time with his grandfather who just shows him how to fish when suddenly white men are coming, and Nullah is told to hide in the water. A white man practically collapses dead on top of him, and when the boy returns to the farm Faraway Downs (where he lives), he first meets the victim's wife, Lady Sarah Ashley (great performance: Nicole Kidman). She has just arrived from England, to persuade her husband to sell the farm, and she's brought to Faraway Downs by the Drover (Jackman, whose wholehearted embodiment of the rugged Aussie is simply the performance of his life).

Now there are 1500 pieces of cattle that have to be brought to Darwin, and there is the inevitable Cattle Baron (very good: Australian veteran actor Bryan Brown) who tries to get his hand on Ashley's farm. His minion, the headman of the farm (and murderer of Ashley's husband), is played by David Wenham - and he does an incredible job, giving the audience a true (but still charming) rattle snake of a villain. He's Nullah's father (after having taken advantage of the fact that Nullah's mother is a handmaid on Faraway Downs), and he's even more dangerous than the Cattle Baron (who at least owns a working conscience while he possesses nothing of that sort).

So we have the cattle drive (which is a deep bow to movies like ""Red River""), complete with a fire attack and a stampede. Of course the prissy, touchy Lady develops a sense for adventure, masters the whole task with strength and humor and finally falls for the country, the delightful Nullah and - of course - for the Drover. How could she not? All that might be terribly cheesy and might ring hollow, if not for Luhrman's sure hand with this classical plot line and the wonderful actors. (One of my favorite - earlier - scenes of the movie is the moment when Drover and Lady Sarah first meet. It's pure slapstick - including a classical Saloon brawl, bursting luggage and lacy ""unspeakables"", sailing through the air - and it made me laugh out loud. And it made me think of ""Support your local Sheriff"", of course. Heh.).

Then the cattle is in Darwin and even aboard of the ship (which means that Lady Ashley actually gets the money to save the farm), and this is where the love story begins. There are very few really ""explicit"" scenes in the movie (though you get a satisfying amount of hugging and kissing), and that - again - gives the movie a beautifully old-fashioned touch. Lady Sarah returns to Faraway Downs together with Nullah and the Drover, and at this point we would have seen enough to have our ""Happily Ever After"" - but Luhrman wants more.

People have said that ""Australia"" wants too much and is entirely too long. Bah Humbug, I say. After regularly watching the three Special Extended Editions of ""Lord of the Rings"", a movie of 164 minutes won't shock me at all. And of course I want to see more.

Drover's and Sarah's happiness is only an interlude, as it had to be expected. Neil Fletcher (Wenham's role) kills the Cattle Baron, marries his daughter and renews his efforts to snatch the farm away from Lady Ashley. He kidnaps his own son and gets him dragged to Mission Island (which was a place to herd the mixed race Aborigine children and ""to drive the black out of them""). This is historical truth, by the way, and a really sad one. In the end credits Luhrman points out that those abducted children - and there were not only mixed race kids but countless others as well - had to wait until 2008 for the Autralian Prime Minister to actually ask the ""Lost Generation"" for their forgiveness. About time, I'd say.

The Drover has left the farm for an army cattle drive - against the will and wish of Sarah - and now she has to try and rescue the child herself. Fletcher offers her to bring Nullah back from the island if she sells Faraway Downs to him, and she agrees. Meanwhile the Drover heads for Darwin, to reconcile with the woman he loves, and he arrives just in time to watch the damage done by the first air strike against Australia ever (by the Japanese air force, on February 19, 1942). He's told that Sarah is on duty in the Army Headquarters (working as a telephone operator), but when he hurries there, the building is roaring with flames. (From this moment on you can see this truly gifted actor outshine the whole cast, and you should have a huge pile of hankies ready).

Thinking that Sarah is lost, the Drover finally finds out that Nullah never went on his personal ""Walkabout"", but is imprisoned on Mission Island, and he starts a rescue mission, abducting a boat and desperately trying to save as many children as possible. Those whole 20 minutes of ""Australia"" are an enthusiastic reverence to ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" (a movie that still makes me bawl my eyes out after more than 30 years of watching it again and again). There be the singing voices of children, a harmonica, playing ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" (which is Nullah's favorite song), a brilliant Nicole Kidman in one of the most emotional moments of the movie, and a Hugh Jackman who is just... gah.

""Australia"" - The Big Screen Version
By Tommy Garrett, Editor, Canyon News

When genius, but very independent, film director Baz Luhrmann goes to work, you know that you will be seeing an epic. ""Moulin Rouge"" comes to mind. But like ""Moulin Rouge,"" his latest epic, ""Australia,"" is saddled with debt for FOX Studios and the shooting of three endings, one of which was reportedly so hard for the test audiences that they had to change the ending. This is rarely done in Hollywood anymore. But after spending nearly $150 million on this film, FOX and Luhrmann both are desperate for a hit. It comes out at a time that is beneficial for movie audiences. Of course it'll be a hit in Australia itself. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, both Aussie natives, have been down under promoting and praising the great film and also the Australians are anxious to see a film that paints their history on the world stage for a change. Aussies have an incredible history just as America. Like America, they get lost in many epic film stories in Europe and Asia. There are countless stories of The Holy Wars of Europe, the Persian Empire and even Alexander the Great. But this is Australia's first time leading the pack in the storytelling of their own history, independent of Great Britain and any other nation.

Kidman is good in her role, but Hugh Jackman is the heart and soul of the film. It almost seemed as though it was not expected or planned, but Jackman brilliantly downplays many scenes and comes off the victor in the film when it comes to showcasing talent. This may be the film that revives Kidman's career, but it is the film that reminds movie goers that Jackman is not only the sexiest man alive, says People Magazine, but one of the most underrated actors of his generation. It's hard to get a headline when you have giants like Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise. But Hugh Jackman proves an old adage that Spencer Tracy once remarked. ""You should not play a role, you should live it."" Jackman may not have been trained by the greats like Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy and Laurence Olivier, but he surely channels them in his acting ability.

FOX Studios official release states, ""In northern Australia prior to World War II, an English aristocrat inherits a cattle station the size of the U.S. State of Maryland. When English cattle barons plot to take her land, she reluctantly joins forces with a rough-hewn stock-man to drive 2,000 head of cattle across hundreds of miles of the country's most unforgiving land, only to still face the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by the Japanese forces that had attacked Pearl Harbor only months earlier.""

Nicole Kidman's Lady Sarah Ashley is much like the actress, strikingly beautiful, with very soft features but a steely strength from within. Kidman, however, seems to play many roles the same way. Her range is only eclipsed by her beauty. Unlike Jackman, who in this role performs as no character I've ever seen him portray before. In addition, being handsome is almost an afterthought to the audience, because he lives this role.

""Australia"" is going to have to compete over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with the mega hit, ""Twilight."" But for those who are history buffs, those who are fans of Hugh Jackman and want to see a movie that is reminiscent of John Wayne's great epic ""Red River,"" I suggest you spend your hard earned money seeing this film. We won't know if Baz Luhrmann is vindicated until the numbers come in from the weekend Box Office tally. But as a genius who knows how to write and direct a film, he gets it. He achieved his goal.

""Australia"" gets Four and a half of Five Stars. The deficit is very minor and Jackman's acting makes up for any lack that any of his costars may share with us. Go see this film, it's really a blockbuster.",1243641600,,3955,4.683453237410072

It also has a good dose of big name stars.  Sadly ""Australia"" lacks the power of synergism, and the parts come across as only a portion of what it could have been.

After watching this film a few times I was struck by the fact that there is a wealth of possibilities in this story, but none of them was developed compeltely enough to be the central carrying force of the entire show.  It seemed like once a central theme was about to emerge the storyline would shift, and we were off in a different direction.  That was the case with the potential comedic element at the beginning of the show (watch for the scene with the kangaroos...you'll see), the budding romance between two of the main characters, the plight of half-white and half-aboriginal children in 1930s Australia, and the who-dun-it that seemely appeared out of nowhere.

Am I glad I watched the show?  Yes, but I don't think that I will be giving it strong recommendations to friends and family.  It's not bad, it's just pretty weak.

I think I've got it!  The writers and producers could have developed at least 4 movies from the material included in this one.  For example, the element of the woman of English nobility coming to oversee the the Australian cattle station could be one such story, another could be the who-dun-it (without giving away any spoilers), another could be the bombing of Darwin, northern Australia, another could be the story of the competition for the government army contract for cattle, etc.

There are so many very, very horrid things about it. Someone mentioned Nicole Kidman's screeching at the kangaroos... unbearable. The leads have almost no chemistry, except with themselves. Baz Luhrmann's camera loves Hugh Jackman's body so much I wanted to be a five year-old and ask him to marry it. He doesn't appear to love Nicole Kidman enough to send her the 1000-calorie cookies Tom Cruise used to send her on set so she didn't become an icy stick. Hugh Jackman MUST regain his neck. No one, after dating a person for three years, still calls them ""Drover,"" especially when reuniting with them after a near-death experience. Seriously, the man must have a name! What does she call him in bed? And nobody, even Hugh Jackman's watery eyes, can convince me that hearing Nicole Kidman say ""Crikey"" is sexy. Oh, and enough with the magic natives, everyone. ENOUGH.

But all that said, I loved it. It was ridiculous and silly and entertaining to the last second. The sight of the DVD makes me crave popcorn like Pavlov's dog. It's unabashedly romantic and sweeping and stupid and fun. The Aboriginal child was amazing, the cattle drive had me on the edge of my couch, and despite myself, I've watched it twice in as many days. So yeah, it's dumb, but I love it.

2. Learning that aborigines were (are?) treated just as distastefully and condescendingly in Australia as African-Americans once were in this country. Mixed race children fared worse than full-blooded whites or blacks because they didn't belong to one group and weren't accepted by the other.
3. The story is set at the time of World War II when walk-abouts were practiced by aborigines. I wonder if the custom is still followed.
4. I didn't know that Australia was attacked by Japan during WWII or that there was a ""lost generation.""

Reasons why I didn't care for this movie:
1. I never forgot it was a movie. To be successful, a movie must take the viewer ""away"" for awhile. I was constantly aware that a movie was ""rolling"" as I watched it.
2. Nicole Kidman once won an Academy Award for Best Actress? Wow, her acting was awful in this movie! What was with the knitted eyebrows all the time? And her hair? What has happened to her hair? It looks like a wig in movies or out of them.
3. Hugh Jackman looks great without a shirt, but he simply lacks the right sex appeal in this role, or was it being paired with Kidman that makes him so blah? What that role needed was Gerard Butler or someone like Clark Gable.
4. What was with Kidman and Jackman in their kissing scenes? What dead kisses! Their lack of chemistry made me think their real life spouses were on the set watching. Un-un-uhhh! No sexy kissing!
5. Horrors! What was David Wenham doing in such a nefarious role? That handsome actor with such a breathy voice used so outstandingly in ""300"" as narrator/poet now playing--and looking like-- a dirty rotten scoundrel! WHO is responsible for this outrage!
6. The bombed harbor scene: All I could ""see"" was a tiny set that could be broken and reset into a bombed harbor scene. I've seen too many behind-the-scenes production segments and recognized this kind of illusion at once. It shouldn't be so obvious!

Now, would someone make a better epic about Australia? I would like to see more of its story. Maybe an aboriginal dreaming story. Make Nulla the star!",1241913600,,2377,4.695443645083933

3756148,2,B001PPGAIK,"There she stands against a wide horizon shielding her eyes against a glaring sun, a woman out of her element in a strange and savage new land. There behind her stands the big house of a western ranch, or tea or rubber plantation. A stoic strong man challenges her and their mutual attraction grows against a sweeping Technicolor canvas as the stereophonic lush romantic score swells to overwhelm our senses and pluck the quivering strings of our hearts. Sounds good doesn't it? This is the stuff of the silver age of Hollywood; the 1950's epics abound in these kinds of films. And now it is back in a BIG way.

  Yes, we have seen this before, and unfortunately done with more conviction and brilliance. And when it is done right it is pure movie magic. For instance the incomparable George Steven's ""Giant"", or the lesser ""Elephant Walk"", or even the soapy yet very exciting ""Naked Jungle"" these are the fathers of inspiration for Baz Lurhman's ""Australia"".

  This film is an ambitious effort that falls on its face under the weight of its director's choices to go way over the top too many times. Now don't get me wrong. I love over the top in my sweeping epics but in good and timely measures. Not from start to finish. It is just too much and becomes self-conscious and takes one out of the film experience.

  The most indulgent of these choices is the casting of Nicole Kidman in the lead. She is too old and her face has changed by some sort of strange process over the last few years as to become hard and well, a little scary. But that aside her performance is not an honest one, she plays the comedy at the begining of the film straight for laughs and that rings false. Comedy in this kind of film and with this kind of character should be played dead serious to make it work. You just don't believe her and her acting is showing all over the place.

  But there were some good things about the film. The boy who the story is really about is just a natural wonder, a pure old acting soul in a child that the camera loves. Hugh Jackman delivers all that is required in the male lead and in the process is natural and believable in the ""Rock Hudson - Charlton Heston"" mode.  The images of Australia are indeed stunning to behold and the cinematography is at times thrilling. But then she pops up in the shot with those puff lips and gives you a start.

  There are those things to recommend ""Australia"" and on a purely visual level you might give it a try. Perhaps if you go in not excepting to love it, the film might work better for you than it did for me. On the other hand, I recommend seeing ""Giant"" instead to see how this genre of film can sing, zing and fly on the wings of lan.",1241568000,,2695,4.349301397205589

The tie-in with Wizard of Oz was very creative and an interesting juxtoposition as well as a play on words.
I really enjoyed most of the film. I do not feel that it is a family film, there are some gruesome scenes, implied sex scenes, and intense action.
It has seemed to have lost a little of the granduer on my little television with regular sound. But I still find it awesome in execution. Well worth a look, especially for people who enjoy epics, Hugh Jackman, or the marvelous land of Oz.",1241308800,,944,4.279329608938547
3756152,3,B001PPGAIK,"It is a bit amazing that after Michael Bay's Hollywood blockbuster ""Pearl Harbor"" there are still ambitious filmmakers out there who are willing to make a grand-scale love romance/action film. Actually Baz Luhrmann's 165-minute epic ""Australia"" looks like two movies in one: an ""Out of Africa""-style melodramatic romance between a man and a woman, and a coming-of-age tale of a young boy, all living in the turbulent pre-WWII era in Australia.

In ""Australia,"" instead of Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman play the lead roles. Despite her initial disliking for his (apparent) rough manners, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), who has inherited her late husband's cattle station in northern Australia, falls for roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman). Because of the contrived narrative device, the unlikely pair joins forces to accomplish one impossible thing - a long journey to get the 1,500 cattle to the port. And this is only the beginning of the long story.

The epic story is told against the background of the country's history. Japanese military forces are poised to attack the country. Not only that. A young boy Nullah, a mixed-blood Aboriginal boy, has to hide from the authorities trying to separate him from his mother and place him in the government's facilities to ""civilize"" him, a topic that Philip Noyce has already taken up in his superb ""Rabbit-Proof Fence.""

As you see, so many things are going on and the film doesn't exactly know where to direct its rambling story or when to stop it. When we think the film ends now, it restarts and goes on telling another story, as if teasing us with fake endings. The characters are one-dimensional, but much to his credit, Baz Luhrmann as director seldom bores us with actions, romance and beautiful landscapes. Jackman and Kidman are attractive (as always) and there are lots of talented supports including David Wenham, Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown, plus my favorite actors Barry Otto and Bruce Spence.

I don't say ""Australia"" is a bad film. With Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman it cannot be, well, at least as a romance that is eye-pleasing. It tries to be something more - plenty of action, comedy (intentional or not) and even historical document. It's a pity that Baz Luhrmann didn't settle on one of them.",1241308800,2,2297,4.973958333333333

Watching Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman at their first meeting I am cracking my sides with laughter. I barely do that when I watch television comedies. Watching them grow to love each other and start to care about others it was wonderful to see their characters develop.

The movie is a romantic comedy, no it is a mystery, no it is an action adventure, no it is a drama. The movie even has a villan who I did despise. And the villan looses everything! And I did feel vindicated! Yes this movie has it all. I loved the little aboriginal boy. He is cute, smart and adorable.

3756155,3,B001PPGAIK,"Well, I'm sorry that I didn't find the movie THAT entertaining.  I have a ""movie test"" - if my husband will watch it in one sitting.  Otherwise, we watch movies in segments - maybe half one night before going to sleep and half the next night.  Really long ones may be watched over three evenings.  A really GOOD movie is one that he is willing to stay up and watch to the end.

My husband got bored with Australia pretty quick.  So, we turned it off and went to sleep.  The next night, we managed to watch it through to where Kidman and what's-'is-face got together and were on the ranch and the bad guy visits her and she says that ""Drover mustn't know...""  So, right there, neither of us wanted to watch anymore.  That was it. That is such a cheap plot trick we couldn't bear being dragged over the coals with that one again.

Kidman's acting was pedestrian at best - I just couldn't warm up to her.  The kid was cute but not THAT cute and everything else was cliche or smarmy.  I doubt that the representation of aboriginal life (and characters) was accurate.  I guess the best part of the movie was the cinematography - but that was more like a David Attenborough ""Living Planet"" thing than anything else.  In fact, I half expected him to leap into the scene wearing his bush outfit and a pith helmet and tell us all about what kinds of creatures Kidman and company really are and what they were doing there.

I would give it two stars for the plot and acting, but it makes it to three for the photography.

3756163,3,B001PPGAIK,"More bothersome than anything about AUSTRALIA is that it is both mislabeled as a romantic epic and that it seems to try and lead the audience in too many artistic directions. While viewing the trailers for it, I assumed it was another Baz Luhrmann visual-fest (if you've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moulin-Rouge/dp/B000077VR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moulin Rouge</a>&nbsp;you know exactly what I'm talking about).

But from the get-go, I got the sense that Luhrmann was trying more to get across a sense of Australia's forgotten history than to entertain us. But then, as the film progressed, the gears of this behemoth began spinning in all different directions at different times. Clocking in at 165 minutes and costing over $130 million, Australia seemed (on the outside) to be headed toward the epic category.

The good is that the film (just barely) holds together. Much of that is thanks to Luhrmann who, although he had a tenuous grip on it, delivered an entertaining mesh. The over-the-top acting, line-deliveries, and color schemes are all what we've come to expect from this dynamic director, too.

Beginning with the life of an aboriginal half-breed named Nullah (relative unknown Brandon Walters), we initially seem to be headed toward the historical drama fold. Similar in tone to another excellent film you might want to check out entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbit-Proof-Fence/dp/B00005JLD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a>, we are given some background on ""the lost generation"" of aborigines who were stolen from their parents and put in ""white homes"". But then the story switches to that of Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139XZF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>), an English woman of noble right who comes looking for her supposedly cheating husband in the back-country of Australia at their ranch known as Faraway Downs. When she arrives, she quickly meets up with the ruggedly handsome and ruggedly tough Drover (Hugh Jackman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountain/dp/B000O7667K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountain</a>) who guides her to Faraway Downs only to discover that her husband has been murdered, the ranch on the verge of collapse, and a group of aborigines hiding in fear of the local constabulary (among them is Nullah). The ""I-despise-you-but-eventually-fall-in-love-with-you"" story will not surprise anyone. And seeing Jackman and Kidman together is pretty easy on the eyes. But then a new wheel finds a cog and we're thrust into the middle of WW II. Oh. And did I mention that Nullah's grandfather is a medicine man and wants Nullah to follow in his footsteps? And that the main antagonist in the film is Nullah's white father? And that a businessman in the area wants to steal Faraway Downs from Lady Ashley? And all of this happens during a cattle drive? Whoa!

To be even more brutally honest, there are a host of other things going on, too, which further muddies the waters. The astonishing thing, though, is that the film remains entertaining despite all of these threads. Kidman and Jackman's chemistry is very believable. And young Brandon Walters delivers an endearing role as the lost half-breed. The scenery, too, is astounding, with rich color sequences that follow sepia tones.

It could've been better by settling on a few less plot threads. But it is what it is. And I'm glad I watched it.

Unfortunately, it ends up more like the kitchen sink, with the director trying to do too much at once, with a who's who of Australian cinema that also does the same.

Jackman is great, Kidman does well but overwrought, she always seems buttoned up anyway. We don't get to see much of the 'happy 2 years' til the war comes, so her whole 'you can't let the kid go walkabout' and scene where he goes to mission island lacks context.

The motiveless malevolence of David Wenham, especially towards his own son, just seemed over the top. As does letting him get away with 2 murders-were they really that backward in the 1940s, even in the outback?

Just like the movie, much of the above could have been edited out.  Overall, however, Hugh Jackman was stellar.  He stole the show, but a great supporting role was turned in by Brandon Walters, who played an interracial child in the middle of every single story arc (except, of course, the romance).  Kidman was average and unconvincing.  Expectations remain unmet, and only the scenery truly impresses.

Some Holly wood executive who has never stepped foot in Australia has taken 30 seconds to scribble this movie idea on a piece of toilet paper and has tried to make a cross between the corniest parts of The Wizard of OZ and an attempt at the humor of Batman (the old TV series), and has failed.",1240358400,9,782,4.185430463576159
3756176,2,B001PPGAIK,"The good: It has a fair score and the cinematography is excellent. There are a lot of spectacular scenes of Australia. The story is touching and good-natured. However I did not like this movie at all. Why? The Bad: It was long - too long. I thought two or three times that the movie would finally be over and I would be out of my misery, but it kept going. The movie is overly predictable. While I did not know the end at the beginning, I always knew what was coming next. The entire thing was filled with cliches and cheesy scenes. There was a lot of overplayed drama, and I thought that it was overly romantic/unrealistic. The narration from the boy was cute at first, but I felt like I knew when and what he was going to say, and was left waiting for him to finally conclude so that movie would end. Finally, I felt that the aboriginal sense of nature, while interesting at first, was overplayed - like much of the movie.
Overall, I thought that the movie was beautiful, but would have actually preferred to watch a nature film like Planet Earth instead of this. It was too long, the story was cheesy, and it was way way too predictable.",1240185600,2,1140,4.331775700934579

3756178,4,B001PPGAIK,"First, no, this should never have been compared to ""Gone with the Wind."" The location is different, the war is different, and the circumstances are different! Perhaps the only similarity in characters is between the overseers, specifically Fletcher of Australia's Faraway Downs and the overseer of Tara plantation in Gone with the Wind. Nicole Kidman's ""English Rose"" who toughens up fast does not compare with Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the ruthless Scarlett O'Hara. Thankfully, the Drover does not compare to ""Gone with the Wind's"" decadent Rhett Butler either!
Naturally, the Australian aborigines are completely different from the black southern American slaves (who probably really ran the plantations). Nullah, the winsome lad from whose viewpoint the tale is mostly told, is the character that really makes the story work. If anyone gives a performance worthy of an Oscar in this film, it's this promising young actor, Brandon Walters, whom I dearly hope to see more of!
Otherwise, yes, if you are a Hugh Jackman fan, you will find the movie worth seeing for his competent portrayal of the gorgeously rugged, diamond-in-the-rough Drover. Will mention that a friend of mine thought that the portion when the Drover appeared at the ball resplendent in his tuxedo was ""Disneyesque,"" and, yes, my friend's viewpoint is valid. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann thought to show that the ""diamond-in-the-rough"" could successfully take on polish.
Since this is a review rather than a social commentary, I won't get trapped into going on at length about the disgraceful way Australian aborigines were treated. Being American, that would be like the pot calling the kettle black (pun - if anyone sees it - is intentional). As someone who's bi-racial (possibility tri-racial), I can say that it's important to be aware that damage has been done and then get on with it - ""it"" being working at being fair, starting with oneself.
In any event, see and enjoy Australia. No, it may not be ""realistic,"" but one goes to movies to escape, not to be further confronted with grim reality. We get enough of that in our dreary, day-to-day lives!",1240099200,,2118,5.089080459770115

Australia is a movie that would not necessarily get good critical reviews, however as an Australian myself I found it to be very entertaining, quite funny in parts and even I learned a lot about my country's history.  There is no doubt that the film covers it's own Cultural landscape very well, and the characters show the futility of the stolen generation plan with dignity and compassion.  The actors are wonderful although the role played by Nicole Kidman seemed a little over the top with her English accent, but Hugh Jackman was supurb as ""Drover'.

3756184,4,B001PPGAIK,"In his epic love letter to his native continent, Baz Luhrmann has crafted a sweeping three hour fairytale, filled to overflowing with beautiful people, scurrilous villains, music and dancing, danger and romance, music and magic. ""Australia"" is an old fashioned romance, and your fondness for it will depend on how you feel about grandiose pictures that were made with the intent to shamelessly grab your heartstrings while visually zapping you right between the eyes.

While not perfect by any means, the scope and sheer WOW factor of ""Australia"" will give deep satisfaction to those movie watchers frustrated by cinema that seems pre-destined to small screen viewing or just load CGI-effects in ever increasing mania while forgetting about the magic that can be made by simply letting the backdrop tell the story. And for the first two-thirds of ""Australia,"" Luhrmann does just that. The impossibly good looking Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) finds herself a widowed ranch-owner forced to fend off the leering advances of Cattle Baron King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy henchman Fletcher (David Wenham). Only the rugged ""Drover"" (Hugh Jackman) can help ""Miss Boss"" save ""Faraway Downs"" from the wicked ranchers. There is a wild west kind of scenario as the Faraway Downs race against time to herd 2000 head of cattle to the docks at Dover.

That is the first part of ""Australia."" After that, it suddenly lurches into a WWII drama. The Japanese are poised to attack while Lady Sarah must undo what Fletcher has done to split her, Drover and Nulluh (the half-breed Aboriginal who spends the movie as its Greek Chorus). Somehow, Luhrmann ties all of this together (along with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and a social comment about aboriginal assimilation) while making it pretty entertaining. If this sounds like a good way to treat yourself to a movie night, by all means go ""Australia.""",1239840000,,1885,5.038461538461538

3756186,1,B001PPGAIK,"Okay. Granted.
 Part of the reason this review is so barbed,  is that I am actually embarrassed that I sat all the way through this movie and wasted that portion of my precious human lifetime.
That being said ...

Forget the advertising hype.

This is one of the worst examples in movie -making of commercial hype and profit- mongering tripe.

I am usually reserved in my criticism of artistic efforts.
Since my opinion is that this does not really qualify as an artistic effort, here goes....
Do not waste even a moment of your lifetime on this mess.
No fooling.
It is really that bad.
A ridiculous and an obnoxious waste of film and talent.

There are elements of history portrayed here that are worth noting, but
not in this manner.
The  script, directing, and therefore the acting, are TERRIBLE.
 Most of the human interactions are insultingly stupid, and  much of the scenery is thinly contrived fakery.

It is exploitive of an appropriate historic interest and the affection one may feel for the country itself and ALL of its people.

If the originators had spent their huge advertising budget on even a fair story/script, perhaps this costly waste could have been avoided.
It is an expensive sick joke on a trusting public.

At the peril of your faith in movies, Do not watch it.
To save regret , do not buy it!
I am not exaggerating .
My gullible wife and I were aghast with disbelieving laughter, nearly retching through it , trying to believe it could somehow redeem itself.
Nope.

We still like Australia and its people though.

THe storyline was plausible and reminscent of an old American Western.  The story within a story of the lost generation of mixed blood Aboroginal children was handled skillfully and not overstated.  I was impressed with Hugh Jacman's performance and felt that Nicole Kidman has grown and matured as an actress.  The movie themes were interwoven in a masterful way and well balanced so as to give each storyline equal coverage. I was pleased to find that there were none of the typical cliches or sterotype charactizations of Australia or the people that make up Australia.

3756188,5,B001PPGAIK,"I'm a Baz Luhrmann fan, but this one is my favorite of them all. He really only uses his frantic film making at the very beginning to establish the characters, and I think it works. It's funny and gets you straight into the story much faster and more effectively than if he had dragged you through it--I think some of the reviewers here didn't know Luhrmann's style or they wouldn't have been surprised. This is the same guy who made Moulin Rouge! I think Luhrmann can bring in some new fans with this one, but he is who he is and some people just won't like it.

The rest of the film is touching, engaging, fun, and romantic. I thought there was strong chemistry between the two leads, but there was also a wonderful chemistry between the rest of the characters that is just as important (I don't want to give away why).

It was more about the child Nala than anything else. So I felt it was entirely mismarketed.  The child should have been included on the features cover. He was the real star. Scenes with him were the only time Nicole Kidman shines.  Her romantic scenes were a flop. Hugh Jackman was amazing, absolutely fantastic! And Drover was the one I was rooting for. Kidman's character never quite overcomes the hoity-toity princess-ness.  Her love for the child is what this movie was about, and honestly I felt betrayed into expecting something different.

This is a story of a point in Australia's history, and Baz Luhrmann has woven a masterful tale bringing together cutthroat cattle barons, the disgraceful treatment of the Aboriginal people and the mysteries of their culture, the Japanese attack on Darwin, a sly play on ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and the delicious romance of two gorgeous people.

The fact that the ""story"" of this unabashedly epic film is narrated by a young Aboriginal boy (played most engagingly by Brandon Walters )is absolutely crucial to its understanding.  It is HIS story: his voice carries the epic, introduces the main characters, and draws the audience into a time of massive social upheaval evidenced by the many differing forms of interaction between non-indigenous (European and Japanese)and indigenous people. On one level Nicole Kidman's uptight Englishwoman (""Missus Boss"") is a cultural caricature,and Hugh Jackman's drover is unbelievably tough, handsome, competent and  moral.  But, to the diminutive narrator they are heroes, and David Wenham and Bryan Brown are the bad guys.  Bound together by his voice with its sometimes comic turns of phrase, the film moves along as a sequence of episodes, with many memorable moments beautifully realised and deeply moving. It is very much classic Luhrman : his luxurious direction clothes his narrator's compelling story in just gorgeous images of Australia.

I thought I was watching some epic film of the past: sweeping vistas, corny-but-nice tugs on our emotions, a real romance and good people doing the right things.  Add to that spectacular photography, colors and direction and you have a very entertaining and rewarding film.

It never overstays its welcome, even at 165 minutes, with just the right mix of adventure, romance, drama and mystery.

Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fit like a glover for a romantic although, as usual in films, they fall for each other a little quicker than normal.  This story is equally a romance and a racial one. The latter comes into play with a ""creamy,"" a child whose parents were black and white and so the kid has no identity (although he leads toward his Aborginal grandpa)

Brandon Walters plays the boy, the center of attention in the film and every bit a star as Kidman and Jackman in here.  He is ""Nullah,"" who also narrates the film.  He is a charmer; no question about that!

It's nice to see Bryan Brown again. For those who had forgotton, he was was ""Rollie Tyler,"" the star of the very successful ""F/X"" movies, about 20 years.  The last I had seen Brown was in a neat little film called ""The Last Hit,"" a made-for-TV film in 1983.  In `Australian,"" Brown's character in another fascinating guy:  ""King Carney.""

3756217,3,B001PPGAIK,"I was excited to get this video and somewhat disappointed in the first half of the movie. I blame it on poor direction as it seemed as if the director did not know if he wanted a campy comedy or a drama as evidenced by the odd over-acting done by Nicole Kidman in the first half of the film. Hugh Jackman was steady throughout and made the film more believeable. And the photography will make you want to travel to Australia! Despite the shaky beginning, I recommend that you persevere to the second half as that is where the film takes on the courage and beauty of the story as well as of the acting. If only it had been that good throughout!",1239062400,,643,4.235772357723577
3756218,3,B001PPGAIK,"OK, it's not too painful to spend two and a half hours looking at Hugh Jackman and the little boy who played Nullah.  I got teary at the points where the director was clearly trying to jerk tears, and it is a gorgeous travelogue for Australia.  Yet the plot has holes you could drive one of those Army trucks through and the characters were pretty superficial.  In 2.5 hours you'd think a little time could be devoted to character development, but instead it was spent on special effects for a cattle stampede near a cliff.  How is it that Lady Sarah is trilling in that really annoying high-pitched squeal over kangaroos one minute (god was that irritating) yet herding cattle shortly thereafter?  Nor is there any reason for her to get so attached to Nullah except that he's so darn cute.  Just not very believeable.

When I asked my friends/ family / acquaintances if they were going to see ""Australia"" they said, ""No, the reviews were really bad!""  So I told them the reviews were wrong and to do themselves a favor and go see it.  They did and they loved it too!  It's a wonderful history lesson about the Australian cattle industry, about the Aborigines, about the attack by the Japanese  on the harbor of Darwin.  It has everything: action; comedy; goodness vs. inexplicable evil; the mysticism of the Aborigines; the tragic fate of the Aborigines children; two unfolding love stories; magnificent scenery; gorgeous music; wonderful acting.  It's about determination, courage, race, magic, loss, triumph. The cast is fabulous!  I knew it was quite a long film before I went to see it, but it was so engrossing the time just flew by!  ""Australia"" is coined as an ""old-fashioned, they-don't-make-'em-like-that-anymore"" epic film.  Thank you, Mr. Luhrmann, for this inspiring and uplifting film!  I wish it had been more successful for you at the box office, but I do believe that ""Australia"" is one of those ""sleepers"" that one day will be considered among the best.  Critics be damned!!!

This despite having a decent cast, astonishing scenery and most importantly telling the tale of the generally overlooked unjustices done by the english immigrants to the native people of Australia.

It seems the director believes it is necessary to make use of the same (in todays eyes) corny punchlines and cliches of the epic movies of the 50s and 60s to develop an epic today. Even the music and sound sends you back in time, with dramatic 'manly' music accompagnying Hugh Jackman as he enters the scene on his horse... outrageous unless it is meant as a parody which somehow does not seem to be the case.

First the good points. The little boy is charming and a good actor. Some of the scenery is beautiful, and Hugh Jackman's character is pleasant to look at.
The bad points are numerous. The story is ridiculously melodramatic at numerous points, and since this is a long movie that gets old fast. Nicole Kidman's acting is, well, what we are coming to expect of her recently, fake lips and all. The scenes in Darwin are cartoonishly fake, with skylines that look like those painted on ceilings they have in some of the casinos in Vegas. Not believable AT ALL. The story is confusing during the Darwin section as well. All in all I would only recommend this to someone who wants to have their heartstrings  unskillfully yanked for a very long time, all the while suspending disbelief.

Ms. Kidman seemed a bit thin, physically and acting wise but was adequate to the task.  I could probably see another actress in that role.  Not sure who though.  After we saw it each time we were thinkin', 'Man, I'll betcha there's a DVD release with a director's commentary and maybe outtakes.'  Yea, it was a long film but we were happy with the length and it seemed like the kinda film where there was probably a lotta scenes that the director just couldn't squeeze in.  Really, we wanted even more.  I loved the character of the drunk, very noble, the pathos of the aborigines.  I wondered how the bad guy was gonna get his.  The grandfather aborigine was magnificent, splendid in his knowledge of the land, woven through his spiritual ability to be part of Australia.  My favorite film is Walkabout, by Nicolas Reog, 1971.  There were some similarities, mainly is how well aboriginies were portrayed.  Makes sense that there'd be a half breed generation stolen from their mom's.  Note it wasn't a buncha white women with aborigine men.  Apparently, there were many Native Americans and, of course, Vietnamese, who were children of white American males and native women.  A nation is judged by history over how they handle those children.  This director did a great job weaving in a zing of almost fantasy, portraying the non Western aspects of aborigine culture in a cool way.  Their search for the right boy to play the role really paid off.  We loved how the new release of the Wizard of Oz played into the storyline.

3756251,3,B001PPGAIK,"To 20the Century Fox, ""Australia"" is a bomb as big as the ones the Japanese dropped in Darwin during the Second World War. To Australia, ""Australia"" is still the second highest grossing movie in Australian film industry. To the audience, mixed reviews are the norm for this $190 million epic that burns a hole nearly in every part of the world.

Australia is not half bad. Seriously. It's Baz Luhrmann, the entertaining director who gave us ""Strictly Ballroom"", ""Romeo+Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge"". However, it is because of that that makes ""Australia"" failed to please anyone who likes the above films. The thing is, Baz has his own directing style, which worked perfectly with his previous films, but trying to keep his own style while trying to tell a real, serious epic story that involved one of the biggest wars in human history just didn't make it right for him. The product was a mix of style and scenes that actually failed to deliver the required chemistry that the audience was expecting.

""Australia"" started off dealing with the topic of the Stolen Generation, but then apart from having an aboriginal boy (who was excellent) and his family to represent the stolen generation and what impact it is having on them, there was virtually nothing really that could touch the audience's heart. It lacks the raw impact of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" (See my review on this) and ""The Tracker"" when dealing with the Stolen Generation. Although one thing I must say was that I was impressed about the blatant dialogue about ""Breeding out the blacks"" which I don't think we see a lot in international cinemas.

The opening of the film looked very Baz and ""Moulin Rogue"" and ""Romeo+Juliet"", you certainly know that it is a Baz movie. But does that kind of entertaining and funny shots actually fit right into the serious notion of ""We are telling the world about Australia's Stolen Generation"" is something else. This inevitably weakened the opening of the film. To be honest, the first half an hour, which was supposed to be used for capturing audience's attention, was so weak that several times I thought switching the terminal (I saw it on a flight) to another channel. It's only my persistent to finish the movie to give it a fair review that I finish this 3 hour ordeal. After the first hour, the movie seems to get its act together again and then it becomes more interesting. However, how many people could be graceful enough to give a 3 hour sit an hour of credit without judging it immediately?

A lot of people were complaining Nicole Kidman as the ice queen and the wooden actress but I must say she is not half bad. The thing is Baz unique direction of trying to make her look too much alike to Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"" to distinguish the character's growth into a serious business woman later just really didn't work. Satine gave Nic her first Oscar nomination, but it was such an impressive character that anything trying to play homage or imitate that character will completely destroy it. And that's the main problem with Nic's performance in ""Australia"". Hugh Jackman's character lacks depth until after half way through, and David Wenham's villain is just they need a villain for the movie and there he went. It is surprising that a 3 hour movie could be failing so badly in character development and at the end of the day, you don't seem to understand most of them except for the drastic change of Sarah (Nic) from a aristocrat to a ranch station owner. Nullah was great but suffers a similar fate. However I really enjoyed his relationship with his grandfather King George - and this is the most interesting aspect of the movie. There are other characters throughout but surprisingly some of them are quite memorable - Essie Davis and Jack Thompson, they are both brief characters but very memorable. Yuen Wah as the ranch cook just feels very out of place and one thing I can't understand is why Chinese actors always have to be the one to deliver comic moments in western movies? It is because of the forced comic moments that he has to deliver that I found him very irritating throughout.

At the end of the day, ""Australia"" is not that bad. But Baz should know by now that piecing a montage of his previous successful styles won't work on serious movie with a serious topic (if that's what he wants to deliver). Also, naming a movie after Australia itself will not help to promote Australia either, and may in fact have a backlash of killing potential audience's interests. Lastly, avoid hyping a movie too much cause as we all know, the greater the hype the bigger the fall. ""Australia"" was killed by a number of unsuccessful elements embedded in the production itself, but if I want to be honest about it, it is not as bad as the media said. It certainly did not live up to Baz's standards (I mean the one we, the audience set for him) but the bad press is more about the media going in for a kill instead of looking at the movie objectively. I would still recommend it when you have 3 hours to kill (such as on a flight) but don't bring too much expectation to it and you will enjoy it.",1238112000,,5105,4.624035281146638

The movie 3 hours is fantastic.  So well made and so interesting and probably realistic for when it was to happen around beginning of WWII.  Had no idea Australia was hit harder than Pearl Harbor probably because closer to Japan.  Both Nicole and Hugh were excellent.

White people bad aborigines good.  It feels like the producers took parts from several movies such as Dancing with Wolves and Far and Away combined them and set it in Australia. The scenery maybe beautiful but it looks like most of it was constructed on a computer.  Nicole Kidman is wooden and boring and the other characters are just that, other characters.  Don't worry, you have seen them before over and over and over again.  Even the soundtrack is an uninspiring rip-off.

3756263,4,B001PPGAIK,"I didn't know what to expect from this film from the mixed bag of reviews I'd seen and heard. Before the film's release, I'd heard about this really BIG, old-fashioned movie about Australia coming out, but once it did all I heard was silence. I don't know one person who went to see it at the theater. So my husband and I rented it and we rather enjoyed it. It's VERY long, almost 3 hours, but the time passed quickly as the story held our interest. It does kind of bounce around from plotline to plotline, but we were interested the whole time and felt we wanted to watch it again when it was over. I was a little disappointed with Nichole Kidman. She's usually so incredibly wonderful, but she seems to have had some ""work"" done on her face so that her facial movements looked awkward and her expressiveness was hindered. She just didn't look natural at all, and I found myself distracted by looking at her odd lips and cheeks. Also, as with many modern movies, the CG effects are so heavy handed that they don't look real at all and (to me) take away from the sense of reality in the film. Hugh Jackman is divine, though. Hunky, muscular, and rough in all the right places, his Drover is the perfect Australian souvenir. I wonder if real Australians found this character stereotypical, because it seemed the director was using the Drover to symbolize Australia to the the viewer. He was a rough-and-tumble bloke who never shied away from a fight, had liberated views about the Aboriginal people, and turned into a dashing hero when the moment called for it. So overall, I will recommend the movie as a good choice for movie night at your house. I think kids might even enjoy it though mine weren't home when we watched it. There is a good bit of violence and a lot of deaths (SPOILER WARNING: a mother dies trying to save her child and a man is trampled by cows and looks pretty gross after) that may disturb the little ones or the squeamish, and there is one sex scene but no ""naughty parts"" are visible.

Ask a bushman he'll tell you all about the flies. It must have been Nicole's perfume ?? Jackman-Brown-Wenham & Thompson (Especially Magic) and the rest of the Dinkie Die actors made this film very watchable. There are parts of the Australian outback culture that were far to fairy taleish for me to believe ! The final harmonica scene on the front of the boat was a bit Titanic like too. I was pondering at times how a frail pomme aristocratic sheila could manage to run a rugged outback cattle station for 6 months without her beloved Drover ?? (Too much) There was also the scene where the church kidnapped the little boy and the soppy scene of him waving on the back of the boat like he was going on a cruise !! with Kidman sobbing on the Wharfe why didn't he jump !! beyond me a little. All in all Nilcole your still a star. The cattle heard were amazing too ! after the long Drove they still looked fat and healthy ! remarkable eh ! Not one Bluey (Aussie working dog) a cattleman's best friend to be seen anywhere ?? Also Kangaroo's running like a flying fleet FJ's and the lack of Dingo's around the herd mmm ! questionable. I did enjoy the bar punch up though !! That was Aussie ! Our young footy player's in season all over Australia still perform this ritual contest (nothing like an Aussie Bloo)I just hope people around the world don't come to Aussie and go wandering around the scrub relating to this movie They'll perish real quick for sure.

3756269,4,B001PPGAIK,"""Australia"" is an epic film, reminiscent of ""Gone With The Wind,"" and ""Hawaii,"" with perhaps, a touch of the fabulous non-epic ""African Queen."" The combination of director and screenwriter Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman is a winning one. Although ""Australia"" is far different from their collaborative effort in ""Moulin Rouge,"" (2001), I enjoyed this unconventional Aussie flick every bit as much. And what could be bad: with rousing action, sweeping landscapes, (kudos to cinematographer Mandy Walker), fabulous costumes, a hero's hero, a heroine worthy of the title, tear-jerking, dramatic kitsch, love, hate, loss, racism, war, a really nasty villain, Australian and Aboriginal history and culture, and so much more?  I say ""BOO"" to the professional critics who panned the film, Most people I know really liked it - men as well as women - so I won't bother to call this a chick flick. I never listen to these critics anyway. This is fun movie!

Nullah, a young boy of mixed race - part aborigine, part Caucasian - is our narrator. He is nothing but wonderful in this role. Nullah is the grandson of King George, (David Gulpilil), an aboriginal shaman who teaches him the magical culture of their people. Nullah and his indigenous family are always on guard against the white ""cops,"" who want to take the countries ""creamies,"" (half breeds, usually illigimate), away from their native people and transport them to Mission Island to be educated in Western culture and religion.

Just before the beginning of WWII, Lady Sarah Ashley, (Kidman), leaves the luxury of her English home to search for her estranged husband, who runs a remote cattle ranch, ""Far Away Downs,"" located in Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah is determined to sell the ranch/station and drag hubby back to civilization. She arrives and storms into a local saloon looking for a man called ""Drover,"" (Hugh Jackman), who is supposed to meet her and drive her to ""Far Away Downs."" And Drover is so not what she expected.

After a 3 day drive through the outback, which really ruffles the aristocratic lady's sensibilities, not to mention her elegant clothes and make-up, she reaches her destination only to find her husband dead, murdered. King George is accused of the crime. Lord Ashley had been attempting to break the monopoly on providing the military with beef held by King Carney, (Bryan Brown), a local bigwig. Carney, who seems to run everything in the area, is looking to have Lady Sarah sell him the ranch at a fraction of its worth, and doesn't care what he or his lackeys have to do to force the sale. After checking-out how things are being run at the ranch, and meeting young Nullah, Lady Sarah, uncharacteristically, decides to stay and make some serious changes.

This film is obviously a labor of love by the director, cast and crew, who are mostly Australian and proud of it! I am always a fan of art, film and otherwise, created with lots of heart. Probably the best moments, for me, are those which deal with the aboriginal culture and the story of ""the stolen generations,"" children of mixed race, who during the 19th century and part of the 20th, were forcibly separated from their cultures by white Australians to ""civilize"" them.

Again, I really like ""Australia."" I was very entertained and recommend it.

Of course, this type of film hasn't been done in a while, so it's no surprise that the acting is awkward at times.  Modern actors acting old-fashioned is probably not a very easy task.  Also, any movie from Baz requires a commitment.  You're entering his world, so he shakes you up at the start, tries to free your mind up a bit, tries to make you laugh, introduces you to his world.  Once you're settled, he continues on his way, and it's a great ride...

It is just a ridiculous movie. It's like a live action cartoon. It should be sold as such.

The storyline was very choppy, and I had to go back & watch the movie again to understand how everything fit together.  This movie is becoming one of my favorites, Nicole Kidman did a great job as the uptight Lady Sarah, who becomes human as the movie progresses.

3756275,4,B001PPGAIK,"Director (and co-writer) Baz Luhrmann's AUSTRALIA is an epic historical romantic drama, sort of a ""Down Under"" GONE WITH THE WIND.

Set prior to and during World War II, the visually stunning film is long (165 minutes), but extremely entertaining.  Nicole Kidman stars as an English aristocrat who travels to the primitive, faraway continent to take over a a cattle ranch after her husband is killed.  Hugh Jackman is the rough-hewn cattle driver, who helps Nicole get her herd to market and, ultimately, wins her heart.  They make a handsome on-screen couple.

Of course, there are villains (David Wenham, Bryon Brown) who try to prevent their cattle drive from succeeding, then there are also the Japanese who bomb the city of Darwin in a very impressive sequence.

Luhrmann paints his story on a broad canvas and, in general, he succeeds.  However, I think that he should have rearranged the structure of the last 15-20 minutes of his film, because, as it now stands, the final confrontation with the story's lead heavy comes off as anti-climatic.

This movie apparently didn't do all that well at the box-office and the reviews were certainly mixed.  I suppose I can see why.  It's maybe a bit longer than it absolutely needs to be and the story is a bit far-fetched.  But, hell, it's a MOVIE.  And I believe that 'a movie' is exactly what it set out to be: a great big, old-fashioned epic with lovely photography, good-looking leading players, a cute kid and a whole lot of running around all over the place.

So if you're in the mood for 'a movie' and want to spend some time looking at pretty moving  pictures of pretty people doing all manner of movie-star stuff, 'Australia' should be right up your alley.

I almost walked out of ""Moulin Rouge"" the first time I saw it in the theatre, it was a good 10-15 minutes before the film settled down from wacky cuts and got down to business.

Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are great together, and you can't help but really like the kid who plays ""Nala"". If you like movies that are different (specifically, if you like foreign films - they are paced differently) you will love ""Australia"". If you loved ""Moulin Rouge"" - you will love Australia.

Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book ""Poor Fellow My Country"" (and his earlier ""Capricornia""), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of ""Poor Fellow My Country"" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.

b) the directing which is just beautiful

d) the homages to movies gone by like Casablanca and other movies of the 30s through 60s
e) the vastness of the story... from formal life in almost Victorian England to Western style cattle rustling in the outback to the grand tapestry of World War II.
f) the peace offering to the Aboriginal people of Australia (finally)
g) the great acting by Hugh and Nicole
h) strong figures (both Nicole and Hugh play complex strong roles) - a boon for women's rights (finally, two lovers on equal footing for different reasons)

The Good:  The cinematography is excellent, treating you to some tremendous vistas of the Australian outback.

All in all the movie rolls right along despite it's three hour girth (though I confess I did watch over the course of two nights).

The Bad:  Kidman's performance is stiff and her chemistry with Jackman is marginal at best.  This isn't helped by those ridiculous new lips Kidman is sporting that look like a couple of greasy Kielbasas.  The storyline is contrived in places and and you can't help but wonder if the director was trying to write two stories.  The result is a jolting transition after the cattle drive that dumps you unceremoniously into part two of the story.

Bottom Line: Australia isn't as good as Oprah would have you think or as bad as some critics make it out to be.  It's not exactly epic but the benefits outweigh the flaws.",1236902400,,1457,4.589147286821706

3756300,3,B001PPGAIK,"This is one of the type of films that people are going to either absolutely love or pretty much hate on.  That said, if you are reading this review, you'll have found that I rated the film a middle of the road 3 (out of 5) stars.  Why did I wind up there? Because the first 20 minutes just about completely lost my interest in seeing the rest of the film (along with my wife, who was also of the opinion we should just shut the Blu-ray off or toss in a definite comedy instead).

It took two nights to get through the complete film.  After watching approximately half of the film, I was left wondering what the people that liked the movie were watching that seems so different than what I've found in watching that first half of the film.  Somewhere in that 90 minutes was what could be a decent film, if the director had decided whether he wanted a comedy, or a drama, or a mystery/thriller.

Instead, it seems that in trying not to be too predictable, and also perhaps in trying to make an epic, the result is, at least throughout that first half of the film, and in several places in the second half too, an overly long film that takes too long getting to the point and telling the story.

Just in that first 90 minutes there was at least 15 - 20 minutes that could have just been left on the cutting room floor and/or never been filmed at all. If it had to be filmed and kept in the story, then certainly much of the material could have been conveyed more efficiently without really changing the meat of the story.

Not being quick to give up, my wife and I watched the second half of the film a night after watching the first half.  The second 90 minutes seems to stay more focused than the first and as a result seems to be less disjointed.  Perhaps it's more predictable, but it just seems better and less comical (and no, I don't mean comical as in it was trying to be humorous and came off that way, I mean comical as in nearly laughable and barely tolerable).

For anyone considering purchase, I really recommend saving your money and going the rental route instead.  Go with Un-box and save your purchase money for something else.  Australia (the film) may look very nice (the picture quality on the Blu-ray disc is very nice), but it may just about lost you (as it nearly did with me) within the first 10 - 15 minutes on seeming to be just plain stupid. Minus that material, it's not as bad, but still takes a long time to get there and then leaves you thinking that the movie is too long and trying too hard when it didn't need to.

Having finally seen the complete film, it doesn't surprise me at all that the movie didn't get much love in theatres and was raked over the coals somewhat by many reviewers.",1236470400,6,2719,4.28515625

  This is a story about a british woman, who goes to Australia, to try to get her husband to sell all his lands, and holdings in Australia! But before she arrives, her husband is killed, and she is now a widow, with a big cattle ranch, that needs alot of money, and then she finds out that there are powerful men after her land, and some are willing to kill for it.

3756308,4,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann needed to re-think his overly long epic of life in Australia during WW II: The first hour of this  165 minute film comes across as caricature with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman being introduced as rather overblown, preposterous characters about whom the audience could care less.  But then suddenly the mood changes, the film becomes tender and real and issues of importance are treated well and presto! - an entirely different film is on the screen.  It would be interesting to see this film edited by a major editor who could comb away the extraneous silliness of the beginning and make this film far more dramatic and solid.

Though the film begins in 1939 and continues into 1941, it feels like an old American Western flick with cattle drives, and rancher disputes and the development of a classy Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman)  from England traveling to her husband's ranch in Australia to face the failing of her inheritance, becoming involved with the politics of her competitor, finding support from her household of Aborigines who manage her ranch with the able assistance of a rowdy Drover (Hugh Jackman).  One important key element in the film is the emphasis on half breed children (half Aborigine, half Caucasian) who are called creamies and who are shunned by both sides of their inherited genes.  One lad Nullah (Brandon Walter) feels he has no one who cares for him outside of a kindly spirit grandfather King George (David Gulpilil) who gives him support from the shadows of the hills of the Aboriginal land.  The interesting part of the film is the manner in which this young boy pulls the other characters together, even during the Japanese invasion in 1941.  At this point the film becomes an epic worth watching and one accompanied by warmth and tenderness as evil is destroyed and the milk of human kindness rises.

Once out of their caricature beginnings, Kidman and Jackman (and Walter) give fine performances.  They are aided by some fine effects from cinematographer Mandy Walker and by a musical score by David Hirschfelder that mixes excerpts from 'Somewhere over the rainbow' with Bach's Hunt cantata BWV 208 ('Sheep may safely graze') and of course the wondrously emotional Nimrod from Elgar's 'Enigma Variations'.  There are elements of information about racism and greed that are treated well.  And by the time this lengthy film is over the audience is left satisfied.  So 5 stars for the second part of this movie and 2 - 3 stars for the first hour  gives if a 4 star overall rating.  Grady Harp, March 09",1236384000,,2556,4.854838709677419

3756311,4,B001PPGAIK,"I missed this one when it was in the theatres, it didn't seem like it was there very long.  I had heard split reviews about the film.  Some hated it, some thought it was mediocre, nobody thought it was brilliant...and it certainly isn't, but it is definitely worth checking out.

I don't do plost synopsis, so scroll up for that....

This movie is so similar to Gone With The Wind in tone it's amazing.  It is truly old-fashioned filmmaking on a grand scale.  This film tried to tackle so many things, that only a few of them pay off in a major way.  The romance between Jackman and Kidman is simplistic and archetypical of any old western.  They have good chemistry and their performances are winning.  There are many big and elaborate set-pieces in this film, but only one really stands out, the stampede scene.  This one has the visual splendor and excitement we go to the movies for and even has a climax that is fun and plays into one of the film's themes.  Don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, so I won't say what. But there are other scenes like the Japanese bombing that is quite underwhelming and doesn't quite have the punch it should.  It feels like that this tale has so much ground it wants to cover as far as Australian history goes and so much old-fashioned cinema conventions it wants to incorporate that it doesn't seem to be able to punch up many set-pieces, with the exception of the cattle stampede.

The only other real flaw of this film comes from the racial issues presented.  It rightfully portrays the racist natures of many of Australia's inahbitants and the British looking to 'reform' some of the natives and 'creamy's' or half white and half blacks.  Native peoples of this region were treated as subhuman and their tribal rituals treated as satanic and primitive.  As if what they believed was any less silly than Christianity.  This is where the film gets hazy.  It seems to take the native's mysticisim literally.  Which means that Nullah(a child in the story that becomes very important to many events) is omniprescent, and seems to be able to appear and disappear at will, along with his on-the-run uncle(who hides in the mountains due to the mis-accusation of murder) King George.  The movie doesn't out-right say that they are superantura, but then it doesn't reallys ay that they're not.  King George seems to be able to appear at will, and at the right times.  Plus, he can easily catch up with men on horses and running cattle on foot, in the mountain tops.  The problem is that it takes some of the drama away from the events.  If they are mystical then why would the boy need so much help, and why would he be so afraid of danger and need so much saving?  Also, and this may be just my take, but doesn't take a little away from their struggle?  Their stuggles in Australia took a lot of human will to uprise, survive and take back the humanity they were denied.  All the mystical elements seem to make their struggle simplified and take some of the importance out of it...at least for me.

So, is the film worth checking out?  Definitely!  It's visually stunning and absolutely beautifully filmed.  The director Baz Luherman(Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet) was obviously very passionate about this film and it's subject and old-fashioned style.  His usual hyperactive, choppy editing style is mostly abscent in this film.  You can feel his presence, especially in the first act(light moments and broad comedy mixed with blunt camera moves) but once the second act rolls he settles down into the traditional Gone With The Wind template.  The acting is all on the money, the script is spritely and unabashedly epic in the old-school Hollywood tradition.  The romance is thin and not especially deep(blowing in the wind cowboy falls for stuck up proper English women, both change after meeting each other) but it works thanks to the movie star casting, and infectious on-screen persona's Jackman and Kidman present.

The dvd editon of the film is waaaaay too sparse.  All we get are two deleted scenes.  This is a 20th Century Fox dvd, so past experience has taught me to expect another extended edition with a second disc of special features.  This is one film I wouldn't mind double dipping on and seeing a meatier version of, especially if we get more depth of character, more beautiful vistas and the basic traditional Hollywood grandiosity.",1236297600,,4398,4.691906005221932

With his latest film, Australia, he decided to take national pride to a whole new level by creating a sweeping romantic epic about his home country that takes place between the World Wars and was made by and starring Australians. With a budget in the neighborhood of $130 million, the pressure was on Luhrmann now more than ever before to deliver at the box office and, while underperforming in North America, it has gone on to gross $200 million worldwide despite a lukewarm critical response.

As he proved with is previous films, Luhrmann has an uncanny knack for casting. Who can forget the undeniable chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in Romeo + Juliet and the sparks that flew between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge!? He's at it again with this new film with the casting of Hugh Jackman and Kidman as the romantic leads.

Jackman finally fulfills those early comparisons to Clint Eastwood as he plays the Drover as a tough, dependable hero who's not afraid to show his vulnerable side. He's never been more charismatic as he proves to be equally adept at the physical demands and the emotional range that the role requires. No one knows how to photograph Kidman quite like Luhrmann. She looks stunning, even covered in a layer of dirt and dust from a cattle drive. At first, her stuffy English aristocrat comes off as a cartoonish stereotype but as her character becomes acclimatized to the country and she develops a bond with Nullah, she becomes warmer and more empathetic.

Beginning in 1939 and climaxing with the Japanese bombing of Darwin in 1942, Luhrmann's Australia mixes the larger-than-life melodrama of Gone with the Wind (1939) with the exciting cattle drive in Red River (1948) and with a dash of The Wizard of Oz (1939). His film clearly harkens back to the kind of cinema that they just don't make anymore with very little CGI used and everything built from scratch and on location. Australia is the kind of ambitious Technicolor epic that might have been made by John Ford or George Stevens. It is a marvel of absolutely stunning cinematography - only Luhrmann could make the desolate outback look vibrant and alive. He alternates between sun-drenched day scenes and night scenes that appear to be impossibly illuminated by the stars.

One should not go into Australia expecting realism. Luhrmann presents a mythologized take on his country. Love him or hate him, you have to respect Luhrmann for not being afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve. He's arguably the most romantic filmmaker working today with the possible exception of Wong Kar-Wai. And with Australia, he has made an unabashed love letter to his homeland on a grand scale.

Not much in the Special Features department - just two deleted scenes. One features the Drover convincing Ashley to stay after her husband dies and another featuring an angry staff serving Ashley dinner. Luhrmann has said in interviews that he's planning a special edition DVD later this year making this version strictly a rental.",1236124800,6,3797,5.749110320284697
3756321,2,B001PPGAIK,"Mother got this at the store. Thought it might be interesting since Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman and the others in this thing have great talent. This thing doesn't.

Great scenery. Wonderful costuming. Great sets. Some of the gags in the scenes are comical and amusing. But every character in this thing is one form of badly played and most pathetic stereotype or another who barely gets two dimensional. Indeed one almost wants to scream Racism at how whites are portrayed. Love scenes completely impotent. Diologue or what passes  for it STINKS. What passes for 'action' can best be described as unimaginative, dragging, forced  or deliberate flop work. Acting clearly lacking. About as exciting as watching paint.

If one wants to do a movie, this one should be studied over for how not to do one. If one wants to do a flop this is the Model to follow.

Nicole Kidman plays a pompous full of herself money grubbing english auristocrat about as sexy and exciting as drab paint work and in need of a good thrashing which she never gets. She is so bad and so spoiled that she must be suspected to be the cause for her husband to move so far away to Australia to get away from her rather than 'the cows not of the animal variety' she attributes to him.

Hugh Jackman for want of a better description plays some sort of ever brawling outback cowboy though he acts like a total outhouse cowclod.

And then there are the big villeins, crock bait and crock shoes, who bring new meaning to Pathetic.

Everybody else is so pathetic, the only reason the villeins do not their own hiss boo theme music or tie some lady to the train tracks for a train to cross  must be simply for want of any brains among the screne writers.

One almost wishes for more action from the Japanese if for no reason than to put this thing out of our missery.

3756324,2,B001PPGAIK,"Once we get past the lengthy travelogue and setup, the remainder of the movie is a snap to predict.  In fact, it is a wide screen, color version of a 1930s western.

A hoity toity English lady (Nicole Kidman) goes to Australia in 1938 to dispose of a cattle station (ranch) that is not profitable.  She meets a scruffy cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) and discovers that her husband has just died at the rundown station. And, oh, there's a cute, ragged, intelligent Aborigine boy who loses his mother.  Soon they all set out with a herd of cattle to sell at the port to save the station from an unscrupulous rival rancher.  I suspect that most anyone can write the rest of what happens.

Kidman looks aristocratic, then sweaty.  Jackman looks sweaty, then shaven and presentable.  They recite their lines without much interest, but that's OK, because the lines aren't very interesting.  The only thing worthwhile is the scenery of a barren outback that doesn't look as if it could support one cow, much less a herd.

She becomes the reason for being in Australia, and like S. O""Hara in GWTW, she epitomizes the strength and purpose of the land, and her love of it in terms of her committments to a child and her Drover lover.

The sweep of Australia is like Stevens' Giant or the better parts of Cimmaron. It has bulk and color, e.g. the rich costumes for this fabulous ball, the fires, the explosions, the cattle drives to the edges of nowhere, reminiscent of Red River, Raintree County, How the West Was Won (the better sections), and those huge Samuel Bronston films, and many more, that give you breadth, dimensions beyond three, and a beautiful musical score to match it all.

3756331,4,B001PPGAIK,"What is this? An action/adventure/romance/war story? Why yes . .Yes it is . .And I love every bit of it . . . While watching this rather long movie, it occured to me that it was as if I was watching a double feature for it seemed like it was going to end at least once if not twice before it actually did though I liked the movie enough that I can't really complain (though it did through my bladder for a loop at the theaters... haha). The first story is a western-esque love story involving English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley (played by Nicole Kidman) and ""the Drover"" played by Hugh Jackman. Lady Ashley originally went to Australia because her husband's (who was recently murdered)ranch was in trouble due to connving greedy English cattle barons trying to take it over. The two, along with a few friends, are forced to attempt to heard 2000 cattle across treachrous Australian outback in order to supply beef to the army (I can't remember if it's the american army or British or whatever . . .)before the greed cattle barons can get there force. Who gets there first you may ask? Well . . .You'll have to watch to find out! And even after all that action and romance, there's even more - a war story! The crew witnesses the attack on Darwin (just months after Pearl Harbour) and we get to see how it affects all their lives (the good and bad).

Good Points about the movie:
*The acting especially extraordinary if you ask me . .Nothing can ruin a movie like poor acting and there was certainly none of that in this stellar movie
*It was educational - I learned a lot about Australian and Aborigional history - the good and bad (I feel real bad for the Aborigionies (sp?) . . .they were abused so much . . .)
*The special effects were pretty nice~

I would list bad points but I don't want to influence anyone to dislike it (which I don't think I have to power to do anyways, but still . . .)

3756333,3,B001PPGAIK,"I know what Baz Luhrmann was attemting to accomplish with Australia. He even hinted at it himself with regards to Gone With The Wind. He wanted a glorious epic of mass proportions but what he really created was a long, beautiful, but sometimes dull film. He strived for perfection but clearly didn't quite make it.

I am a HUGE fan of Moulin Rouge. I love everything about it-the music, the acting, the costumes and the story. I can see some of that shining through in Australia as well. The beautiful array of colors, just splendid choreography and direction, there is no question about that. The problem lies with the script and the plot.

This movie did not need to be over 3 hours long. I do not mind sitting through a film that long- I have done plenty of times before. But there were obvious parts that just dragged and some that were not necessary at all. The parts with the cattle drive were especially tedious, and that was most of the film...

The 'magic' aspect didn't really fit into this. It worked in Moulin Rouge but for obvious reasons. This to me, is more of a serious film with serious issues. Stealing aborigines children and removing them from their home is something that should have been the main aspect of the plot. But it was muddled along with the other, less important subplots. Of course there is a bad guy-nicely played by David Wenham, and a hero-Hugh Jackman.

Jackman is the true gem in this film. He carries basically the entire film and at least makes it more interesting to watch.  Nicole Kidman, usually a huge favorite of mine, seemed somewhat lost in this. She appeared to overdo most of her lines and while she looked lovely in her part, it just didn't suit her all that well. I was a bit surprised at that. The little aborigine boy, played by Brandon Walters was a heartwarming surprise. His acting,  I thought, was extroadinary.

The climax of the film was more anticlimatic than anything. Just a tad predictable. I am indifferent with how it played out, though the very end gave me a slight lump in my throat...

All in all, a worthy and well-made film. Clearly it took a lot of time and effort on everybody's part and should be commended. It's just not the sweeping epic Baz of the rest of us were hoping for.",1234915200,54,2251,4.513513513513513
3756334,5,B001PPGAIK,"I first saw AUSTRALIA last November on my birthday. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie, but I absolutely loved it and it made my list of top ten films of 2008.

Directed by Baz Luhrmann, the movie begins with a written introduction explaining the ""Lost Generation"" of Australians, children who were half-Aborigine and half-white that were taken away from their parents and raised by the government or private organizations. This is important because even though the film takes pieces from a variety of different genres: adventure, Western, comedy, action, war film, and romance, the movie revolves around one particular child of the Lost Generation, Nullah (Brandon Walters), and his search for identity.

Nullah's mother is a servant on the cattle ranch of Lord Ashley and his father is one of Lord Ashley's most trusted ranch hands, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham). Lady Sarah Ashley believes that her husband is sleeping with an Australian mistress and travels to the cattle ranch to confront her husband. Instead of confronting her husband with his infidelity, she instead is greeted by recent murder. She soon learns that her husband had been honest and was giving the ranching life a chance. The Ashley ranch was the only cattle operation on the continent that was keeping the tyrannical King Carney (Bryan Brown) from having a complete cattle monopoly on the continent. With the death of Lord Ashley it is assumed that the Carney will now win a prize government contract and squeeze the life out of any competition left. However, Lady Ashley isn't as frail as she seems and with the help of the nomadic Drover (Hugh Jackman) sets out to win the contract, save the ranch, and keep competition in the cattle trade alive and well on the continent down under. Of course, along the way she and Drover fall in love. And all through the journey Nullah is present as Lady Ashley becomes a mother to the orphaned boy and Drover becomes a father figure. But, that's not all either because in the background is the threat of war as Japan's empire grows and becomes hungry for world conquest.

AUSTRALIA is a beautiful film with some of the most gorgeous and spectacular cinematography seen in a film in 2008. The film brings Australia to life and despite the hardships that living there can bring, it's easy to see how people can fall in love with the place. There are a few cheesy moments (e.g. Hugh Jackman showering or Hugh Jackman's entrance into a party), but overall the acting is exceptional, especially Brandon Walters as Nullah and many of the secondary performers. Lady Ashley and Drover are leads next to Nullah, but it is Nullah and the cast of non-lead characters that dominate the film and make the movie from just being an overblown love story into a film about a national epic about the people of Australia.

AUSTRALIA was panned by the critics and though it did reasonable at the box office, it was in incredibly expensive film to make (it took about nine months of filming). However, everyone I've talked to that has seen the movie have really enjoyed it. It's a great movie that has just the right mix of everything, including an homage to THE WIZARD OF OZ. I'm sure that with the DVD release AUSTRALIA will become a hit and one of those movies that people will wonder why they never got to see it in theatres.",1234828800,,3334,4.733218588640275

1. Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) heads off Down Under to find out what her hubby is really doing when he says he's mustering cattle.
2. Kidman's performance is her best since Far and Away, and the cattle ranch Down Under is named Faraway Downs - coincidence or lingering sentiment?
3. Super hot Aussie all-rounder and hoofer Hugh Jackman heats up the screen as Drover, the Crocodile Dundee-type chappy who rounds up the cattle on the hoof.
4. Turns out that Lady Sarah ends up in the middle of a cattle war with the reigning King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy sidekick Neil Fletcher (David Wenham)
5. Some of the story is narrated by Nullah (Brandon Walters) a young half-caste boy who sends Lady Sarah's heart over the rainbow
6. No prizes for guessing who else sets her heart aflutter
7. When droving cattle towards a billabong, never say Never Never
8. Still about two hours to go for this epic romance/adventure/drama that highlights the fate of half-Aboriginal children known as the Stolen Generations with the backdrop of the Japanese bombing of Darwin during WWII
9. You won't notice how long you've been sitting there

After watching this movie you'll want to know why it hasn't been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. (It's up for Costume Design) You'll find that it's both a heart-breaking and heart-warming memorable epic movie with big sets, gorgeous scenery, award-worthy costumes, magic and mysticism, humor, and yes, great acting.

Caution: Watching this movie may give one the urge to:

1. Load up a tucker-bag and head off on a walkabout
2. Throw another shrimp on the barbie
3. Tie a kangaroo down, Sport
4. Watch Judy Garland movies

I don't know if this story really happened, but it is a great story.  If it didn't happen, I'm glad somebody wrote it, and it happens on the screen.  Apparently the mistreatment of Australian natives and the arrogance of the Australian Government to rip half-breed children away from their aborigine parents really happened.  According to the movie, the Australian Government apologized for the mistreatment of its aborigines many years after it occurred.

I cried the first time I saw this movie.  I love it when a movie is so good that it can make me cry.  This movie made me cry several times.  So I went to see it again, to see if the first time I saw it it was really so good.  It was really so good.

So I went to see it again a third time, and a fourth time, and I think a fifth time, too.  And I cry each time. And I can't get over it, I cry each time I see the movie.

I love Nicole Kidman.  I wish I could kiss her, she is so great.  She steals the show.  And Hugh Jackman... he is also so great he steals the show.  And the little boy is fantastic... he is magic... he steals the show too.  And King George... he steals the show, just standing there... A show where 4 actors steal the show, that's a show!

I am going to place my order now for the Blu-Ray of this movie.  It won't be released until next month, but I want to order it now.  I don't have many movies in Blu-Ray, but I have a small collection of Blu-Rays of the very special movies I love, like Big Fish, Phantom of the Opera, Finding Neverland, Across the Universe... and now without any doubt, Australia.

Director, Baz Luhman, has served up a slab of nostalgia ala Australian style with all those beautiful elements we love from films of the 40's and 50's, breathtaking, sweeping landscapes, gorgeous costumes and two fine actors in Kidman and Jackman who get the essence of the film. It nostalgia in every sense of the word, in every frame. The acting style reminds us of Bogart, Grant, Bacall and Dunne. The story is epic in every way and just lovely. I loved the salute to ""The Wizard of Oz""a really nice touch!

Of course we all know how it's going to end. Watching Australia was like eating a box of Quality Street chocolates. Sure I know what I'm getting, but I still love it.

3756340,5,B001PPGAIK,"Having seen the movie more than once has given me a more nuanced appreciation of this epic movie. Its storyline tackles the relationship between two people coming from different cultures who eventually found themselves together -- initially at odds, in love, and part of a family unit -- all amidst the backdrop of the sprawling Australian outback, the divide of races and social strata, the age-old clash between good and evil, and the onset of the second world war in the Pacific! The movie experience is like curling up with an extraordinary epic novel - and at the end feeling what a well-spent afternoon it has been!

The movie's length does justice to this tale of love and adventure in a faraway culture and of unusual natural beauty. The cinematography provides all the lush scenes of the Australian landscape, the rush of blood in some of the most awesome action scenes, and the loving closeups of the story of the relationship between Lady Sarah Ashley, The Drover, and their defacto son, Nullah! The musical score gives the movie the perfect complement to the excellent cinematography. The story unwinds from an initial meeting full of comedic winks ( including the now famous shower scene - featuring the leading man!) and clashing cultures. It then dawns on the central role played by the child Nullah and his aboriginal culture. Plus what would an epic movie be without the quintessential villains? As the movie progresses and we witness the triumph of the independent cattle company versus the monopoly, it also gives us a slice of Australian history and its development in its early frontiers. When the second world war breaks out and it marches down to Darwin, we are caught in another story between good and evil, so cinematically well-portrayed. And they lived happily ever after, with a twist --the expected end of a truly epic movie!

Who are the main characters and how are they portrayed?

Lady Sarah Ashley is the English rose who became an adopted daughter of the Australian frontier. She is transformed into a loving nurturer of a child and the harsh land because the relationship which came into her life also changed her outlook. Nicole Kidman very ably portrays this complicated woman who changes from a non-sympathetic character to a caring heroine. This transformation is so well portrayed in the changing face of Lady Ashley - from the very beautiful and well-turned out woman to the woman whose inner beauty shines through her bedgraggled locks and almost plain face, through her pained expression as she undergoes tragedy and is touched by sorrow, and finally to the look of someone who has come to terms with what is important in life. This is one of Nicole's best movie portrayals!

The Drover has a mysterious past and a rough image as we are first introduced to him. He is a man who is iconic in the history of the outback but it was his reaching out to the shunned aboriginal community in the past which showed that he was an extraordinary man. In the song by Elton John, played second in the movie credits, called The Drover's Ballad, his story turns out to be rich in tragedy and a life full of love for the outback, which gives us more of a complete picture of this man with a heart of gold. The tragic life seems to follow him even much later in the movie - and this is where he shows his heart on his sleeve! Hugh Jackman is magnificent in the role and it is hard to imagine anybody else giving a more masterful performance. The magnificence is not just in how he looked ( Baz Luhrmann did show Hugh Jackman as the representation of physical perfection...surprisingly, because the other choice was Nicole Kidman) but also in his acting chops. There are several scenes where Hugh displays his acting range at the highest emotional level - when he realizes that the people he loved may have become victims of the tragedy of war...and then the realization that fate had actually been kinder. Who can't help but be mesmerized by his face and his voice in the scene by the burning war HQ and at the ruined bar, in the Mission Island rescue, and at the wharf in Darwin? Had the past of the drover been more meaningfully played out on the screen, the role could have garnered Hugh an award recognition!

The third important role is the child Nullah, as charmingly portrayed by a new child actor named Brandon Walters. He charms everyone except the villain. He is in a sense at the heart of the story and Brandon makes us follow Nullah's journey with almost a maternal/paternal eye for his welfare in the story. At the end, he is conflicted about his real family and culture, but I am sure that when Nullah grows up, it will both cultures and both families that he will truly call his own!

Kudos likewise to the actors who portrayed the main villain, the iconic aboriginal character, the Drover's friend and main man, even the hotel keeper and his gruff ways...as well as to the other Australian actors who gave life to this epic story.

The creatives have done well to transform such a tale magnificently on screen! Baz Luhrmann provides the vision and the direction of the story-telling with such interesting and charismatic characters and amidst a magnificent background of natural beauty, culture, and slices of history!

While the movie could only be given full justice in a cinema with its impressive big screen and excellent sound, I would still love to get a DVD/blu-ray version to allow me to see it again and again - much like wanting to read and re-read a very good epic novel!",1233705600,4,5525,4.700413223140496

Its storyline tackles the relationship between two people coming from different cultures who eventually found themselves together -- initially at odds, in love, and part of a family unit -- all amidst the backdrop of the sprawling Australian outback, the divide of races and social strata, the age-old clash between good and evil, and the onset of the second world war in the Pacific!  The movie experience is like curling up with an extraordinary epic novel - and at the end feeling what a well-spent afternoon it has been!

The movie's length does justice to this tale of love and adventure in a faraway culture and of unusual natural beauty.  The cinematography provides all the lush scenes of the Australian landscape, the rush of blood in some of the most awesome action scenes, and the loving closeups of the story of the relationship between Lady Sarah Ashley, The Drover, and their defacto son, Nullah! The musical score gives the movie the perfect complement to the excellent cinematography. The story unwinds from an initial meeting full of comedic winks ( including the now famous shower scene - featuring the leading man!) and clashing cultures. It then dawns on the central role played by the child Nullah and his aboriginal culture. Plus what would an epic movie be without the quintessential villains?  As the movie progresses and we witness the triumph of the independent cattle company versus the monopoly, it also gives us a slice of Australian history and its development in its early frontiers.  When the second world war breaks out and it marches down to Darwin, we are caught in another story between good and evil, so cinematically well-portrayed.  And they lived happily ever after, with a twist --the expected end of a truly epic movie!

Who are the  main characters and how are they portrayed?

Lady Sarah Ashley is the English rose who became an adopted daughter of the Australian frontier. She is transformed into a loving nurturer of a child and the harsh land because the relationship which came into her life also changed her outlook.  Nicole Kidman very ably portrays this complicated woman who changes from a non-sympathetic character to a caring heroine. This transformation is so well portrayed in the changing face of Lady Ashley - from the very beautiful and well-turned out woman to the woman whose inner beauty shines through her bedgraggled locks and almost plain face and through  her pained expression as she undergoes tragedy and is touched by sorrow, and finally to the look of someone who has come to terms with what is important in life.  This is one of Nicole's best movie portrayals!

The Drover has a mysterious past and a rough image as we are first introduced to him.  He is a man who is iconic in the history of the outback but it was his reaching out to the shunned aboriginal community in the past which showed that he was an extraordinary man. In the song by Elton John, played second in the movie credits, called The Drover's Ballad, his story turns out to be rich in tragedy and a life full of love for the outback, which gives us more of a complete picture of this man with a heart of gold. The tragic life seems to follow him even much later in the movie - and this is where he shows his heart on his sleeve!  Hugh Jackman is magnificent in the role and it is hard to imagine anybody else giving a more masterful performance.  The magnificence is not just in how he looked ( Baz Luhrmann did show Hugh Jackman as the representation of physical perfection...surprisingly, because the other choice was Nicole Kidman) but also in his acting chops.  There are several scenes where Hugh displays his acting range at the highest emotional level - when he realizes that the people he loved may have become victims of the tragedy of war...and then the realization that fate had actually been kinder.  Who can't help but be mesmerized by his face and his voice in the scene by the burning war HQ and at the ruined bar, in the Mission Island rescue, and at the wharf in Darwin?  Had the past of the drover been more meaningfully played out on the screen, the role could have garnered Hugh an award recognition!

The third important role is the child Nullah, as charmingly portrayed by a new child actor named Brandon Walters. He charms everyone except the villain.  He is in a sense at the heart of the story and Brandon makes us follow Nullah's journey with almost a maternal/paternal eye for his welfare in the story. At the end, he is conflicted about his real family and culture, but I am sure that when Nullah grows up, it will both cultures and both families that he will truly call his own!

Kudos likewise to the actors who portrayed the main villain, the iconic aboriginal character, the Drover's friend and main man, even the hotel keeper and his gruff ways...as well as to the other Australian actors who gave life to this epic story.

The creatives have done well to transform such a tale magnificently on screen! Baz Luhrmann provides the vision and the direction of the story-telling with such interesting and charismatic characters and amidst a magnificent background of natural beauty, culture, and slices of history!

3756342,5,B001PPGAIK,"This movie was by far my favorite of 2008, even with such crowd-pleasers such as The Dark Knight and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's story is well formulated, honest, and believable. The acting is superb, with Hugh Jackman stealing his scenes and Nicole Kidman has the most developed character of any film she has ever done. Sprinkled intermittently with comedic moments, Australia is presented in a raw, emotional format with a hint of epic provided by the sweeping wide-angle shots of Australia's scenery. This film deserved more ratings and awards than it has won, and it's Baz's best movie yet. Yes. Better than ""Moulin Rouge!"". Best of 2008!",1233360000,70,656,4.972727272727273
3756343,3,B001PPGAIK,"THE FILM

After many months of anticipation, Baz Luhrmann's epic motion picuture ""Australia"" has opened in theaters. The director of such deliciously extravagant spectacles as ""Moulin Rouge!"" ""Romeo + Juliet,"" and the giant stage phenomenon ""La Boheme,"" Luhrmann is indeed a storyteller but, first and foremost, a showman on the grandest scale possible, and his latest offering is no exception. Visually, his films look sumptuous, with production design that is so lavish and imaginitively unusual that the films seem to be carried along with the winds of escapist fantasy.

""Australia"" is different in some ways from, say, ""Moulin Rouge!"" his previous effort. The new film, due to its setting in the rowdy, rugged desert continent ""down under"" during the Second World War, necessarily ties in with historical and social issues that are not to be taken lightly, such as the relations of the Aborigines, especially their children, with people of European descent. It's also a story about class, focusing on interclass relationships, and business and life in a harsh environment evocative of America's old wild west, and with as many social parallels.

The movie exudes Luhrmann's trademark brand of exuberance and boisterousness, which feels exciting of course, but there are several moments, especially in the first forty-five minutes or so, when such a tone is misplaced, given the dead-serious significance of what is happening onscreen at the time. Presenting the story cloaked in such a tone, along with the irreverant humor in some scenes (also something of a trademark of this director), actually marginalizes, to a degree, the very real tragedies suffered at the time: social ostracism based on race, ethnicity, class, or gender; wartime attacks on civilians by foreign countries; military camps for unwanted children; and, to a lesser extent, generational differences. ""Moulin Rouge!"" could afford to take a more playful approach, due to its telling of a story that, compared to that of ""Australia,"" seems of less consequence (though still tragic in its own way); this film shouldn't have that luxury. It is evident that the filmmakers' were well-intentioned in depicting these issues and, fortunately, this picture does not persistently remain so flippant.

The story (conceived by Luhrmann, who also wrote the screenplay with Stuart Beattie,  Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan) is narrated by one of those aforementioned ostracized kids, a young boy by the name of Nullah (charming, soulful Brandon Walters, making his movie debut) who, as the son of an Aboriginal woman and a White man (the identity of the man is not entirely clear until toward the end of the film), is derisively considered a ""cream,"" as all such children are. It is also the story of a wealthy, exquisitely well-mannered Englishwoman, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, gorgeous and first-rate, as usual, continuing her work with Luhrmann after starring in the director's ""Moulin Rouge!""; she was also the villainess in an adventure of a different sort, ""The Golden Compass""). Upon arriving in the country, en route to her late husband's mansion in the Australian outback, she seems humorously detached from any world outside her one of privilege to the point where the movie seems to ridicule her as a floozy. It's an example of the movie's style diminishing the importance of such a character, who, as the film itself later shows, was ahead of her time in her developing a lucrative and powerful business despite her sex, her relations with members outside her established class, and her acceptance, care and compassion for Aborigines and Aboriginal children at a time when the Europeans and their descendants routinely institutionalized them, supposedly for the benefit of society.

When circumstances leave Nullah a child alone, Lady Sarah welcomes him into her home, and, eventually, into her heart, despite her initial feeling that she would not be a good mother. In an effort to cheer him up, she tries to tell him the story of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" going so far -- at Nullah's gentle insistance -- as to sing a few songs from the old classic (badly, as she's out of tune and can't remember the lyrics or, for that matter, much of the story). Her surrogate child loves music and loves to sing, and does so quite beautifully, especially his favorite, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" One some levels it makes sense that it becomes a running motif through the rest of the film, given the more fantasy- and childlike aspects of the production. However, it is also rather overused and grows a bit saccharine, especially as the film becomes more serious.

Finally, the story is also about Drover (Hugh Jackman, conceived here as the very epitome of physical manliness, much more so than in ""The Prestige,"" the stage musical ""The Boy from Oz,"" or even ""X-Men: the Last Stand""), a cattle driver as tough and rugged as the land, to whom Lady Sarah becomes infatuated soon when he gives her a ride in his truck soon after her arrival in the country, as prearranged -- and soon after he wins a knock-down, drag-out brawl at a local bar. Drover is the practical answer to Lady Sarah's progressive ideology. Where she is the optimist, what would today be considered liberal, who feels society's standards must change, he is a pragmatist whose eyes are colored by tradition and Australia's status quo; he's not necessarily against change, he just can't imagine it would happen. He soon shows her the feeling is mutual, and Nullah effectively becomes their adopted son. Drover is rather like John Wayne in any number of old Hollywood westerns, though more sexed-up, with Jackman's big, hairy muscles, frequently seen with no shirt. The main drawback to their relationship is that it seems the chemistry between the two leads is sometimes lacking, especially early on.

Their shared goal is to make something more of the scrappy cattle business now run by Lady Sarah -- a.k.a., ""The Boss"" (except while herding the cattle, at which point Drover assumes that role, unquestionably) and defy the ruthless tactics of their more successful rival, King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his cruel-hearted deputy Neil Fletcher (a cold-bloodedly villainous David Wenham, who previously appeared in a different kind of role within a different kind of Australian western, ""The Proposition"")

The film, several years in the making, was clearly a labor of love for Luhrmann, his Bazmark team and, it seems, the cast. Their devotion to it shows, just like in all his previous efforts. Luhrmann and the principal cast, including Kidman and Jackman, probably had more invested in this film, emotionally, than usual, since it focuses on the country from which they hail.

At its stylistic heart, ""Australia"" is a Hollywood production of epic proportions. A widescreen presentation that is CinemaScope-esque. A meaty running time (clocking in at about two hours and forty-five minutes) that doesn't feel long. A huge country populated by people with huge personalities, ideas, and muscles. Big social issues. Lavish parties. Epic sequences of suspense and action (the bar-room brawl spills out into the dusty streets and seems to involve all the men in the town; later there's a stampede at cliff-side; a perilous no-man's-land desert crossing, and, finally, a massive air raid). ""Small"" or even ""average"" is clearly not in this film's vocabulary. It's more reminiscent of films like ""The Searchers,"" ""Giant,"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia."" In many ways its visual and tonal aesthetic seems rooted in classic films such as these and others.

But, this is also a film by Baz Luhrmann, so the images we see are not merely grand, but super-stylized, sumptuous, and over-the-top, more restrained than in ""Moulin Rouge!"" but by no means reserved. And, except where noted as inappropirate above, that's not a criticism. Shots that I'm sure were already impressive with their high-gloss sheen and glorious views are given further lift by impressive digital special effects, well-done in that they blend in with the fantasy elements of the story. Technically, the film is engrossing and superb.

When all is said and done, this movie, despite the issues it addresses, is not really a history lesson. At its heart lies the classic Hollywood spirit of pure, old-fashioned cinematic entertainment, in all its big, brash glory.",1233187200,10,8353,5.129316678912565

I can't wait for it to come out on onto dvd so I can have my copy and watch it over and over again.
I never listen to moview reviers , as I prefer to go and see a movie for myself and judge. And this movie is one for EVERYONE. Go out and watch before it comes out on DVD. You have to see the beauty of it on the big screen. The special effects are amazing. go and see AUSTRALIA.",1232841600,9,817,3.9878048780487805
3756345,4,B001PPGAIK,"I love Howard Hawks' films...Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday, Red River, and Rio Bravo are amazing pieces of entertainment.  As I was watching Australia, the new Baz Luhrmann movie with Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, I kept thinking...man, Baz must really love Hawks' movies, too.

As evidenced by the films above, the mismatched couple who fight and fight until they realize they're perfect for each other (see Much Ado About Nothing, Taming of the Shrew, and Moonlighting as other examples of the form) and the group of underestimated misfits who come together to fight evil are two big elements used again and again by Hawks.  Throw in a bit of John Ford's The Searchers and its hard look at racism leading to inhuman deeds and mix well and you have...Australia.

The problem modern audiences may have with Luhrmann's new movie is it's very, very earnest.  This is straight ahead epic storytelling with its heart on its sleeve and hat and boots with never a wink to the crowd in the theater to say ""ain't these people quaint"".  You either buy in or you don't.  If you do, like I did, you're in for a hell of a ride.

This, I feel, is the flip-side to The Dark Knight.  Good and evil are trapped in something akin to a battle and an embrace in Nolan's Gotham City.  You root for Batman, but he does stuff that is on the wrong side of freedom and civil rights.  The Joker is pure crazy, but he's the most mesmerizing character in the film.  In Australia, there are good guys and bad guys and you are either really good or twirl your mustache evil.  The main villain actually may be a bit too two-dimensional in that aspect, but it didn't hurt my overall enjoyment.

Why?  Well, epic melodrama is hard to pull off...I'm talking about the real stuff here.  The recent BBC production of Bleak House is a great example.  There are very good and very, very bad people in that story, but the acting is so fantastic you rarely if ever catch yourself rolling your eyes (like whenever I've watched Smallville...see: bad epic melodrama).  Kidman and Jackman sell their characters...the displaced Englishwoman and the rough-hewn ""Drover"".  They are thrown together just to, initially it seems, thwart a nasty cattle baron from monopolizing the beef industry in the country.  But the other big story, the main one in fact, centers around Australia's ""lost generation"".  These were Aboriginal children who were fathered by white men who didn't claim them.  They were taken by the government, the mothers had no rights,  and handed over to the church to be taught to ""act white"" and then work in the servant class.  Nullah, played by the fantastic child actor Brandon Walters, is one of these ""creamies"" who has been hidden on the ranch now owned by Lady Sarah Ashley (Kidman).  Lady Ashley discovers what is going on, is horrified by the law, and works to keep him hidden as well.  Why the Drover cares so much about Nullah becomes clear later in the film (no, it's not what you think...that would be too easy) and Jackman's experience with stage and musical work does him proud here.  He can do earnest better than almost any actor alive when he needs to and his later use of the f-word (the only curse I can remember from the entire film) hits so hard, in just the right emotional moment, that it kills.  Russell Crowe was originally cast as the Drover but backed out.  If Crowe had done the film, and I have liked him in other things...the Napoleon-era British navy film that I can't remember the name of right now, it would not have worked.  Crowe never loses that bit of edge and the Drover, at one point, really has to fully break down and become completely vulnerable.  Jackman shines at that point.

Anyway...a warning, the movie is long 2 hours and 40something minutes, but I didn't realize that until I had left the theater.  I saw it alone...I was out of town at a pediatrics meeting...and that's a good thing.  I didn't have to hide from Holly the few times the movie hit me a bit too hard and do that cough-throat clearing thing we dudes do to cover up a stray tear.",1232668800,127,4070,4.5836791147994465
3756346,5,B001PPGAIK,"I was dragged to the movies over the holidays a feat I never normally enjoy, the usual run of the mill drama, action and romance, blah, blah, blah without the bang.
However when I saw this film I was amazed...

This is a powerful tale, however conceived. With a rock solid story line of love and romance but intermingled is the story of grit, determination and true human reality, Some either missed the facts, The presence of racism and discrimination and the power of the mind, body and soul or they just overlooked it enblock may be the reason it did not get its just ratings in the media.

A movie of Hope, A movie that says you can get it if you really want, Brandon Walters ""Nullah"" in his ""young"" role brings across masterfully these goals for life brilliantly.... Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman usual skills aside; David Gulpilil ""King George"" was sleek in his role. He made clear the section of life we most often forget... in people who have been here before us they have a lot to teach us if only we want to learn.

The acting of Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman was wonderful, there was definitely chemistry between them, and the boy who plays Nullah pulls you in with that bright smile and those big brown eyes-and for never acting before, he did a great job. After watching Hugh Jackman on youtube, I think he is one of the most versatile, talented actors there is. And yes, he is certainly dreamy to look at. You would have to be dead not to notice.

It has several favorite American movie genres. It's a western, a war movie & love story between people from different social classes. The first part has cowboys, a cattle drive, treachery & a budding romance between boss Lady Sarah & her hired hand, Drover. That neatly transitions into the start of World War II & the Japanese sneak attack on Darwin, a port in northern Australia. This happened 10 weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While not as devastating it was in many ways similair. Another subject touched on is the genocidal racism praticed by the white imperialist on the original native inhaibitants. The vistas of Australia's outback are breath-takingly beautiful & the production of the war scenes was well done. Then you have the acting leads. Nicole Kidman & Hugh Jackman are likeable bone-fide movie stars. Not much to complain about as an entertainment vehicle.

Whereas the grandiose and somehat kitschified movie 'Titanic' succeeded in getting my heart racing when I saw it on the big screen for the first time, I was practically flatlining for most of this one, even during the more audacious scenes like the bombing of Darwin, I had so little interest in the cartoonish characters, and dare I say cartoonish landscape that I was almost wishing for the film to end 30 mins before it did.
When I think of all the amazing stories, past and present, that are part of Australia's fabric, for this one to be told and for it to claim the full title of 'Australia', wow.",1231113600,2,807,4.422818791946309
3756351,1,B001PPGAIK,"Watching Hugh Jackman single-handedly embarrass himself and ruin his so-far mediocre career is the best reason to watch this monumental disaster. Nicole Kidman is past 40 but still insists on playing these babe-out-of-the-woods roles that should go to women 15 years younger than her.

I don't know what was worse - watching the absolutely irritating Aborigine boy do his `magic' (I was wishing he'd be trampled to death by cattle during these disgusting scenes), or his equally boring grandfather practice his desert-dancing (a hideous spectacle no matter how drunk you are). Add to this the semi-interesting storylines about the racial tension and `half-breeds' (which could have been addressed instead of this line-toeing), and ""Australia"" is just too ugly and ridiculous to take seriously.

While watching this, it was evident that Baz has lost all spark. The CGI is especially weak, and the directors' obsession with cattle is disturbing (at least 30 minutes of this film focus lovingly on cattle running, cattle grazing, cattle standing and thinking, etc). And watching Nicole Kidman serve people tea out of bone china is mind-numbingly boring, no matter which way you cut it. So, I guess to add to the `sparks', we have Hugh Jackman take his shirt off every now and then, and there is this one scene where he shaves off his beard and emerges looking like a 1930s drag queen, complete with violet eye-shadow (I kid you not). Just plain queasy.

In the middle of this nonsense, we've got Nicole and Hugh falling in love (or `lust', though obviously they have zero chemistry), and their scenes together are more time-consuming that idly watching paint dry. The one-liners are unintentionally funny, as both lead actors are given some senseless monologues every now and then just to break the tepid goings-on. My personal favorite is when Hugh says ""Just because something should be, doesn't mean that it IS"", or something like that. Or was it ""Just because something IS, doesn't mean that it should be"". Either way, the line doesn't work at ALL. What it does do however, is to make you intensely dislike both lead actors (not that the idiotic child actor was any better), but the sad news is that all the characters live and no one dies.

At the end of the film, we have a shoot-out, with the boring kid trapped in the middle. Instead of giving us a useful ending and finishing him off, they let him live, and this means a happy threesome at the end with a `tear-jerking' shot of Nicole, Hugh and the boy clasping each other to their bosoms like nobodys' business. If this sort of revolting idiocy is your bag, then by all means, indulge!

""Australia"" is the perfect example of a film that should never have been made. A bad storyline, horrible acting, sick script, and poor effects, but more than that, it has absolutely NO soul whatsoever. Which of course, doesn't work. I would recommend that the director retire, alongwith his two tired leads. This was one movie that had one bad shot after the other, and certainly one of the worst films I have ever watched in my life.

Zero Stars. A monstrous abomination. I really wish Nicole Kidman would just go away and live her life alone somewhere and not bother us anymore.",1231113600,5,3224,4.8209764918625675
3756352,5,B001PPGAIK,"This film is long, slightly too long maybe, but the intention is clear : to give the feeling of time an Aborigine may have since he is in direct connection with the cosmos. And the whole film is about that cosmic call. You have to let yourself be led into that contemplative story telling in these slower moments. But the film is a lot more interesting on several other issues that concern the West directly. First our world wars and their absurdity, in fact the absurdity of all wars. The beginning of the second world war in Australia is shown as having no reason, no motivation, no sense of organization or humanity. Even in the evacuation of Darwin the Aborigines are not taken into account. They do not exist in a way, and what's more the mixed blood, particularly the young mixed blood who are taken away from the world into some kind of Christian mission to be assimilated, though that is impossible in a segregative system, are literally locked up on an island on the direct way of the Japanese, abandoned in the hand of God that can do little in front of Japanese bombers. It is obvious that this is a reflection of the wars we are waging and wasting and losing in the world, waging for sure, wasting because there are more economical ways to reach some political objectives than a war, losing because a war is always lost by those who start them, in the short run or in the long run. I have even the tendency to believe that winning a war is a defeat in a way because it glues to your skin that you are what you are only because you used violence to achieve it. Today the use of violence is becoming if it has not yet become, an unacceptable course of action. Bush did not understand that. We can see today where we are. And we have to get out of these quagmires, Afghanistan being the second. Then maybe we will be able to run after Osama Ben Laden who is not an Iraqi, not an Afghani, nor anything really, except somewhere a Saudi, and finitely a criminal terrorist. That film could not be more powerful on this subject. The second subject is of course the racism of the Australian policy concerning the Aborigines and the mixed blood. It shows how this segregation, this racism, this assimilation policy, and all that goes along with this official policy that considered some human beings as inferior to the whites, is absurd because it takes a white to assassinate the other white who is on his way to stealing what is not his, and it takes an Aborigine to be the screen that will save twenty or twenty-five children. The point is this film shows both the absurdity of the Australian policy and the potential of these Aborigines and mixed blood when they were given free rein on their courage and initiative. At the same time it shows how even white people can change. This leads to another question n that is fundamental: who or what makes history? There is no answer here except that history is made in a way or another and there seems to be the belief that with some time distance history is getting better all the time, even if at times it goes back slightly due to the vanity of those who believe they can make history, like here the Japanese, the monopolistic capitalists, and a few others. One thing is sure in this film though: God does not make history. It takes three men and a boat to save the children who were in the hand of God and could have been killed by the Japanese. There is maybe one more thing behind this film: the world will not change if we do not integrate in our thinking the equal existence of those who are different from us, no matter how little or how much. And there the final scene is essential: accept that child to be what he is called to be, an Aborigine, because his initiation trip to the country of his ancestors is going to give him the identity he needs just to be one human person.

Nicole Kidman kept losing her English accent. Hugh Jackman totally overdid his Australia accent but looked amazing without a shirt so that was a bonus. I think it came down to Baz Luhrmann. He might not have made some good choices. With such famous/experienced people in the cast, the film should have been better. I liked Bryan Brown because he did not over do it. Brandon Walters and David Gulpilil Ridjimiraril Dalaithngu were amazing!!! I hope they both see my review. They improved the movie tons. The Wizard of Oz parts were fun to see too.

3756355,5,B001PPGAIK,"War's imminent, but Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) is tired of waiting for her husband Maitland to sell his Australian property and return home to her.  Despite her husband's admonitions, she flies to Darwin on a mission to convince Lord Ashley to sell Faraway Downs and come home to England.

She lands in the middle of a cattle war.  King Carney (Bryan Brown) owns all the cattle ranches in the territory save for Faraway Downs, which he's trying to put into enough straits to make the owner sell with the help of Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) who ostensibly is the manager of Faraway Downs, but has been helping Carney siphon off cattle across the Billabong River for quite some time.

Lady Ashley's husband Maitland is dead, supposedly the victim of a Aborigene spear.  But, she's seen the other set of books that Fletcher's beeng keeping for Lord Carney.  Lady Ashley fires Fletcher.

Now the race is on.  In order to survive, Lady Ashley's got to drive 1500 head of cattle to Darwin to sell them for the Army contract ahead of King Carney.

And war has broken out and it's coming to Australia.  The police want to take Nullah (Brandon Walters) away from Faraway Downs, because the boy is a 'creamy' or a half-cast (half Aborigene and half white).  While Lady Sarah is not a drop maternal, she's fallen for the boy and for Drover (Hugh Jackman) who's contracted to help her get the cattle to Darwin.

The story's much more than this.  ""Australia"" has all the ingredients of a good Western, an excellent war film and a fine romance all tied up into a fairly elegant package.  Add to that, one of the most compelling performances by young Brandon Walters I've seen.

Warning:  take your tissue with you and don't get a large drink.  The movie's long and you're not going to want to leave, either to wipe your eyes or go to the restroom. This one, I am going to want to own in Blu Ray.

AUSTRALIA takes you on a journey with a young member of the stolen generation, played charmingly by 12-year-old Brandon Walters.  It's about changing hearts, sacrifice, and finding love in the Northern Australia territory during World War II.  There's a cattle stampede, murder, and the Japanese bombing of Darwin two months after Pearl Harbor.  Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Brandon Walters are excellent. The audience has applauded at the end of every showing I've attended.  Comments I've heard from other audience members have all been positive.",1229731200,7,699,5.243243243243243

I counted at least thirty lines of dialogue in this movie that were stolen from other films (""Just because I am a woman doesn't mean I'm not as capable as a man."" ""Without love, you have nothing."" etc.). When the film isn't spitting out one visual or verbal cliche after another, it's inflicting one of the most annoyingly precocious child actors in the history of film on the audience. At one point, it appears that the aborigine boy (who serves as the voice over narrator!) has been shot. I yelled out, ""Thank god he's dead finally!""
Nicole Kidman does her usual ice princess routine here - is she acting or was it all of those scientological counseling sessions? Hugh Jackman takes off his shirt and shows us he is a hunk. Of course, they hate each other at first but this is the movies and - SURPRISE! - they end up falling in love. There's just one problem, though. Outside of being the only two attractive people in that area of the outback (the aborigine women look like  - well, primates), there's absolutely no reason for these two to be together. Must have been desperate lust.
You won't give a darn about Kidman getting her cattle to market in time to save her ranch. You just won't care. You won't care if the annoying child actor becomes a servant of the elite or is allowed to run off with his grandfather. You won't give a darn about that either. At the end of this bloated and sophomoric attempt at an epic movie, you will only care that you have wasted three hours of your life.
Added note: the movie tries to make us believe that the aborigines can do magic. I find the suggestion that native peoples have supernatural powers or knowledge that ""white"" people have lost because they are ""civilized"" to be absurd. If you want to see magic, go to Florida and watch the space shuttle take off. Forget about the wackos who think that aborigines can stop cattle from stampeding with ESP. I wish those ""white"" people who pine away for native shamanic knowledge would strip off their clothes and run off with these savages and see just what kind of harsh lives these people live. Since the average life span of these people is usually 30 or so (I guess all of that supposed magic isn't helping them too much with life extension.), we could cull humanity of these New Age nutjobs pretty quickly.",1229299200,2,2509,4.478165938864628
3756358,4,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann has done with Australia what David O. Selznick managed to do with DUEL IN THE SUN--he's created a sprawling epic of a canvas for a narrow storyline about a woman who needs a man to keep the villains from double-crossing her in a land deal. It's the kind of story every B-western had in the old days, usually with someone like Roy Rogers or Gene Autry playing the cowboy who helps a girl keep her ranch from the outlaws who want it. Here the tale has been expanded to include racial overtones (which DUEL also had) and some good cattle drive scenes that teeter into cliff hanging territory.

Of course, he's added bits of Australian history to the background of the story--such as the treatment of Aborigines whom the villain of the piece calls ""creamies"" and a World War II sequence of Japanese bombing an island off Australia and heading for Darwin. No expense has been spared to make these scenes look very realistic. For production values alone, it deserves a 7.

A sensitive looking boy named BRANDON WALTERS is effective as the boy Nullah whom Kidman comes to love as her own son. Unfortunately, the scenes between Kidman and Walters are clumsily handled by the actress who seems to be forcing herself on the characterization of a woman uncertain of herself when relating to children. Her ""Over the Rainbow"" moment seems unauthentic.

HUGH JACKMAN is great as the cowboy called Drover who is assigned to escort the British born Lady Ashley (NICOLE KIDMAN) on a cattle drive where she intends to get a handsome sum for her cattle. DAVID WENHAM makes an excellent villain as the man who opposes Kidman and Jackman all through the story, getting his comeuppance as all good villains eventually do.

The sheer predictability of the tale is what hurts it most. We all know that Jackman and Kidman will be locking lips long before the fadeout and that Wenham will make a nasty exit. What we can't foresee is that the story will drift in all sorts of directions about racial inequalities and weird rituals with a bit of World War II bombings thrown in.

The casting of the leads hurts the story. Jackman is fine and has obviously buffed up for the role but Kidman is the wrong actress for the part, unable to summon the sort of temperamental display that someone like Kate Winslet was able to do with the role of Rose in TITANIC. A stronger actress would have been a better choice.

However, having said all this, there are plenty of gripping moments in ""Australia"" that make you wonder why the film isn't doing as well as it should at the box-office. For all of its faults, it's still more engrossing than many films that bring in larger crowds",1229212800,,2656,4.628450106157112
3756359,3,B001PPGAIK,"Yes, the scenery is grand and the scale of the production likewise, but overall, ""Australia"" simply failed to deliver.  I guess you could describe it as an epic.  At nearly three hours, it delivers on this front!  But still....it failed to deliver any sort of knockout punch.

The film is set during the early years of the Second World War in both Darwin and the outback reaches of Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to a huge cattle station called Faraway Downs which is being managed by her husband.  She arrives to find her husband murdered and she thence becomes involved with some very shady businessmen.  They want her property and hope to see her on the next plane back to England.  The male love interest is High Jackman who plays ""Drover"" which is a description of his job but also, for the film, the only name that he is given.  The pair seems to bond well on screen.

The rest of the film is the basic love story set against a stunning scenic back drop.  There is also a back story of the ""stolen generation"" where the young aboriginal boy, Nullah, steals the show.  It is he rather than Kidman or Jackman who is the real star of the show.

Overall, I found this film disappointing.  It was clich&eacute;d and predictable.  However, I suspect that overseas audiences will warm to it.  Horses for courses.",1229212800,,1354,4.630252100840337
3756360,3,B001PPGAIK,"No other movie this year satisfied my mushy, overripe, dramatic, romantic core like Australia. It satisfied all my expectations of sexy stares, double entendres, mean scoundrels, naked kissing, pretty clothes, and a sweaty, dirty, muscular Hugh Jackman.

As of all movies of late, Australia was at least 15 minutes too long although I didn't get the feeling of it dragging in any part. The orchestral scores were too loud and dictatorial. The admiration of the Aboriginals mysticism was raised to almost a near-condescending level of being praised too much. The critics were right with their middle-of-the-road reviews. Cinematically, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either.

With all that said, I wasn't disappointed by Australia. It wasn't as frenetic or eye-straining as Moulin Rouge or William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Nicole Kidman's acting was pleasant as the Lady Sarah Ashley playing her both straight and with tongue firmly in cheek. Hugh Jackman yet again proved that he can be both a guy's guy and a girl's guy playing the rough-hewn Drover--a man who can control females of both the horse and human variety while drinking cheap rum from the bottle and with a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from his lip. The entire cast was a delight especially the young Brandon Walters who played the mystical bi-racial Aborigine boy at the center of most of the movie's non-romantic action.

The big scenes of the movie, a cattle stampede and the bombing of Darwin, was worth the price of admission. It made my heart race and me gasp with anticipation even when I knew the outcomes. There was one scene I really did enjoy, but only because of the audience's reaction. The Drover, who is an outcast, sets high society's tongues a wagging when he arrives at a ball to claim his lady. As the camera pans up to reveal the lean, well-dressed, clean shaven handsomeness of Hugh Jackman, there is an audible contented sigh from the ladies in the theater followed by a group groan from the men in the theater. But the sighs were louder, and that pretty much sums up Australia.",1229126400,,2077,4.894886363636363

3756362,4,B001PPGAIK,"Baz Luhrmann's (""Romeo + Juliet"", ""Moulin Rouge"") new film ""Australia"" pretty much defines the term 'sweeping epic'. And Luhrmann has created a film that is three things.

Very sweeping. Very epic. And very long.

Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, ""Moulin Rouge"", ""The Others""), an uptight English woman, arrives in Australia to convince her husband to sell their ranch and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Upon her arrival, she finds Drover (Hugh Jackman, ""X-Men"", ""The Prestige"") and takes an immediate dislike to the crude hired hand. But he is her transportation through the Outback and they set off on the arduous journey. Upon their arrival at the ranch, she finds her husband has been killed and she stands to lose everything unless she can drive her cattle to port, to fulfill an Army contract, before the evil cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown, ""FX"") can use his considerable resources to fulfill the contract. Her only choice is to ask Drover to help her out. They enlist the aid of the Aboriginal people who work the ranch, including Nullah (Brandon Walters), a half white Aboriginal boy. When Nullah's mother dies, Sarah cares for the boy and tries to protect him from the government forces intent on taking him away from his mother and Sarah. The trek is treacherous and made all the more difficult by Carney's right hand man, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham, ""300""). But the cattle make it to port and Sarah is able to fix up the ranch. Then World War II threatens their Eden and everyone must help out in the war effort.

Baz Luhrmann's films are, if nothing else, visual. And ""Australia"" doesn't disappoint in that regard. Luhrmann seems to have a fascination with picture books or pop-up books, because this influence continually reappears in his last few films. In ""Moulin Rouge"", he framed practically every image in deep reds and created 2-D frames for give the film a very stylized look, never allowing us to forget we were being transported into the director's inner mind, a journey many disliked. In ""Australia"", a fictionalized epic, he can't do this type of thing as much, but he certainly gets away with it more often than you might expect. The film begins with Nullah narrating the arrival of Lady Ashley and the beginning of the story, much like a parent might tell a bedtime story. But Nullah is relating a legend. He is Aboriginal and his people learn about their history and their way of life through recounting their legends. After a few minutes, he stops himself and we go backwards, to before her arrival, to get more of the details.

Luhrmann's style is very graphic and he seems less concerned with getting meaningful or authentic performances from his actors. Occasionally, he achieves this, but it almost seems to be an accident. In ""Moulin Rouge"", every performer appears to be trying to achieve the live action equivalent of a comic book character. Shouting, mugging, laughing too hard, every emotion is too broad and too big. But it works. And ""Moulin Rouge"" is one of my favorite films of all time. In ""Australia"", Luhrmann is going for something a bit more natural, and this works less well. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman topiline the cast, and they are both good, but unremarkable. They almost get lost in the epic and sweeping nature of the story.

As much as Luhrmann wants to present a slice (a very large slice) of the history of his birthplace, these theatrical flourishes tend to depreciate the actor's performances. At one point, the camera sweeps in on Bryan Brown who plays the villainous cattle baron King Carney, as he laughs maniacally and the gold filling in his tooth sparkles on cue. If Luhrmann were really interested in presenting a slice of history, or dare I say, an Oscar contender, he would have held these artistic flourishes (excesses?) in check.

Nicole Kidman plays Lady Sarah Ashley, a very uptight English woman who reluctantly travels to Australia to encourage her husband to sell the ranch they own and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Kidman's character is the typical uptight noble woman it almost seems every English woman is required to be. Why? Because she must transform before the end of the film. She will transform from the frigid, proper, uptight English woman and become less rigid, more romantic, and more open and all of this will be caused by ""Australia"". She will become a WOMAN in this strange, unusual land.

Story events lead her to become the de-facto mother for Nullah. Initially, she is very cool and aloof to him. When he experiences a personal tragedy, she approaches and crouches down and says ""There. There"" in the most impersonal way someone could. While this moment is necessary, I never really felt like Ashley and Nullah ever have a true bond. Yes, they cry when they are separated, they cry when they are reunited. They cry. And cry. But it doesn't always feel real.

Naturally, because Lady Ashley is so uptight, she will take to the Australian outback as naturally as a cat to water. Everything about the Outback will be a test for her. Can she open up and adapt? Or will she run back to England never to return? And if she dislikes the Outback, she will dislike Drover (Jackman) IMMENSELY. At least at first. Drover is the pure embodiment of everything the Out back is. Laid back. Rugged. Determined. Strong willed. And, of course, Jackman is very handsome, so Kidman's Ashley has to be drawn to him as well. But there will be, at first, clashes and fireworks.

And this is another problem with ""Australia"". It's so damn predictable. If you've ever seen a movie like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Out of Africa"", you will recognize most of ""Australia"". Apparently, Luhrmann shot a few alternative endings and let some test audiences determine which one was included in the film. What he chose, based on their reactions, was the most acceptable, most recognizable, more predictable ending offering no surprises or to help set the film apart.

Hugh Jackman is good as Drover, the rugged man of the Earth who becomes a reluctant ally to Lady Ashley. Initially, they unite to join forces against King Carney. Then, they unite to... well, unite.

Drover is a good old boy who 'works for no man' and feels very comfortable sleeping on the range, maybe more comfortable than in a bed. He gets in drunken brawls, he drives horses and cattle, and he rarely shaves and looks great riding a horse. And Lady Ashley doesn't know what to think of him.

At one point early on, Lady Ashley sits next to the fire on their initial trip to her ranch. Luhrmann then begins panning the camera across Jackman's broad, defined back as he soaps himself down. Soon, he reaches down for a bucket of water and douses it over himself. As the camera lingers over his torso, many women and gay men should thank Luhrmann for this piece of soft-core porn. Really, the camera moves in much the same way a Playboy video would capture a bunny washing a car. Oh, did I get that wet?

And naturally, Ashley does a double take and realizes she is staring wantonly at her hired hand. She quickly composes herself.

Throughout the film, Drover and Ashley struggle with the idea of a relationship and what that means to each of them, providing a little of the conflict in their relationship. But this isn't really the part of the story Luhrmann cares about telling, so it remains in the background.

If Luhrmann had confined his story to the tale of the cattle drive, the resulting film would be better. Just as predictable, but better. But it isn't enough for Luhrmann to simply tell the story of the love of these two disparate individuals. He has to tell an 'important' story, an 'epic' story. So, he sets it against both the backdrop of World War II and includes the story of the Lost Ones. Both of these stories are interesting, but seem to have been tacked on as after thoughts.

The better addition is the story of Nullah and what the Australian government did to all half-caste Aboriginals they could get their hands on. They uprooted these children, the product or sexual intercourse between a white man and an Aboriginal woman, and sent them to isolated areas, to be educated, to live together, to be held captive. Removed from their parents, the government was doing two things; trying to hide the evidence of affairs involving powerful white men and trying to make the children more acceptable to the community. And this happened for a shockingly long period of time.

Luhrmann thrusts us into the middle of this dramatic piece of Australia's history allowing us to experience it through Lady Ashley's eyes, through Nicole Kidman's performance.

Despite a few references throughout to the impending war, the last hour of ""Australia"" seems tacked on. There is a very clear division between two of the stories; when the cattle drive ends, we then pick up the threat of war. And because of this, the war sequence only serves to make the film seem longer than it already is.

And it's long.

Many people are making references to ""Gone With The Wind"" when they discuss ""Australia"" and I see the connection. They are very similar in scope, story, two strong leads, etc. And if you have seen ""GWTW"" or ""Out of Africa"", which I think is a better comparison, you will recognize most of ""Australia"" as you sit and watch it. And because Luhrmann is much more restrained with his over the top visual style, we are left watching a fairly predictable film.

The question for you is can you sit through two hours and forty-five minutes of a predictable film?",1228953600,,9568,4.741431148526759
3756363,4,B001PPGAIK,"The story opens in 1939, in northern Australia, as Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) arrives from England to sell her huge cattle ranch.  The neighboring cattle baron has killed her husband and scared off all of her workers except for one drover (Hugh Jackman) with whom she locks horns immediately.  Sarah also meets Nullah, a half-white/half-aborigine orphan who is afraid of being captured by the police.

The movie tries hard to be an ""epic"" and certainly is sprawling in scope, especially in the big cattle-driving scenes.  (Unfortunately, the CGI cattle were obvious and made it feel somewhat like a cartoon.)  I really couldn't understand the Aussie accents, so I was a bit hampered on the fine points of the story.  And the movie couldn't decide if it was a western, a love story, a fish-out-of-water comedy, a war story, or a protest movie about the treatment of aboriginal people.  It covered all these plots, was way too long, and felt a bit choppy, but still I sobbed through the last half hour.

Kidman starts out as a silly nitwit but develops some personality and depth in the second half of the movie.  Jackman is well-cast as the rugged and nameless drover, but the real star of the show is Brandon Walters who plays the half-caste Nullah.  He's a natural actor, always believable, and very charismatic.

Overall, it's an OK movie; it tries to do too much but is well-made.  3.5 stars.",1228780800,,1402,4.771784232365145
3756364,4,B001PPGAIK,"First, no, this should never have been compared to Gone with the Wind.  The location is different, the war is different, and the circumstances are different!  Perhaps the only similarity in characters is between the overseers, specifically Fletcher of Australia's Faraway Downs and the overseer of Tara plantation in Gone with the Wind.  Nicole Kidman's ""English Rose"" who toughens up fast does not compare with Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.  Thankfully, the Drover does not compare to Gone with the Wind's decadent Rhett Butler either!
Naturally, the Australian aborigines are completely different from the black southern American slaves (who probably really ran the plantations).  Nullah, the winsome lad from whose viewpoint the tale is mostly told, is the character that really makes the story work.  If anyone gives a performance worthy of an Oscar in this film, it's this promising young actor, Brandon Walters, whom I dearly hope to see more of!
Otherwise, yes, if you are a Hugh Jackman fan, you will find the movie worth seeing for his competent portrayal of the gorgeously rugged, diamond-in-the-rough Drover.  Will mention that a friend of mine thought that the portion when the Drover appeared at the ball resplendent in his tuxedo was ""Disneyesque,"" and, yes, my friend's viewpoint is valid.  Perhaps Baz Luhrmann thought to show that the ""diamond-in-the-rough"" could successfully take on polish.
Since this is a review rather than a social commentary, I won't get trapped into going on at length about the disgraceful way Australian aborigines were treated.  Being American, that would be like the pot calling the kettle black (pun - if anyone sees it - is intentional).  As someone who's bi-racial (possibility tri-racial), I can say that it's important to be aware that damage has been done and then get on with it - ""it"" being working at being fair, starting with oneself.
In any event, see and enjoy Australia.  No, it may not be ""realistic,"" but one goes to movies to escape, not to be further confronted with grim reality.  We get enough of that in our dreary, day-to-day lives!",1228780800,3,2126,5.077586206896552

3756366,3,B001PPGAIK,"A movie easier to admire than it is to embrace, ""Australia"" is Baz Luhrmann's epic salute to the land of his birth.  As with all of Luhrmann's films, ""Australia"" is an eclectic mixture of various and sundry elements and styles, ranging from sweeping vistas a la David Lean to cattle stampedes to barroom brawls to larger-than-life romance to wartime melodrama to social commentary to Aboriginal mysticism to lowbrow comic hijinks.  It doesn't all come together in the final analysis, but Luhrman earns himself some points for at least  making the effort.

Set in 1939, ""Australia"" stars Nicole Kidman as Lady Sarah Ashley, a British noble woman who travels to the land Down Under to join her husband on the cattle ranch he owns and operates there, unaware that he has already been murdered under mysterious circumstances.  Hugh Jackman is the rugged ""drover"" assigned to transport her from the coast to the isolated property deep in the outback.  Thus begins a tumultuous relationship that will take them across the continent and straight into the eye of World War II.

Kidman and Jackman have charm and charisma to spare as the initially sparring couple who eventually become an item, and Brandon Walters captivates us completely as the mixed-race boy who becomes an integral part of the lovers' lives (the absurd caste system which allowed half-white children to be torn away from their aborigine parents becomes the major target of the movie's social criticism).

Yet, while Lurhmann keeps things moving at a fairly brisk clip, he hasn't provided a focused enough narrative to pull us through a movie as long and grand in scale as this one is.  Say what you will about Lean's work, his storylines and characters always seemed commensurate in depth and gravity with the scope of his projects.  For significant stretches of time, ""Australia"" seems far too piddling, far too frivolous for the kind of movie it wants to be, while at other times, particularly towards the end, it threatens to wash away the audience in a tidal wave of manufactured sentimentality.

Still, for all its weaknesses, ""Australia"" provides us with enough virtues of performance and filmmaking (the landscapes are literally stunning) to warrant at least a mild recommendation.  As a special added bonus for movie lovers, the film pays homage to such classics as ""The Wizard of Oz, "" ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Giant,"" the first one overtly, the latter two more subtly, through imagery intended to invoke our memories of them.

Thus, though the movie itself may be far less than the sum of its parts, the parts alone make it worth seeing.",1228608000,3,2610,4.945080091533181
3756367,1,B001PPGAIK,"What a disappointment. Unfortunately, Australia is more akin to watching a three-hour episode of Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman filmed in the style of Bonanza than an epic film set in the wilds of Australia. The characters are flat, and the film is predictable from beginning to end.

I am not sure what was worse, the slow motion Mr. Olympia pose that Hugh Jackman (Drover) assumes at the beginning of the film to establish himself as the ""love interest"" or Nicole Kidman's (Lady Sarah Ashley) semi-reprisal of her character from Far and Away; at least Shannon Christie was believable.

Even the cinematography was marginal. Either the character's reaction shots were filmed against a matte or the backdrops and the lighting were so poorly chosen that it looked as though a grainy image was set behind the actors in postproduction, either way it looked bad.

The one redeeming quality of the film is that the character Nullah allows audiences to have a cursory glimpse into the culture of Aboriginal Australia. Moviegoers would be better served however, by watching the film's three-minute preview and reading about the subject.

It is set in World War II, in the Northern Territory of Australia - alternating between the city of Darwin, Faraway Downs (the working ranch at the heart of the movie), and the rolling landscapes of the Kimberly region.

Directed, produced and co-written by Baz Luhrmann (of ""Moulin Rouge"" fame), the movie features many of his tell-tale trademarks, including a movie that truly focuses - and evokes - the great emotions of the characters and the audience as we are all swept up into the tale of Nullah, the half-Aboriginal child (Brandon Walters), Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), and ""The Rover"" (Hugh Jackman).

Australia is a classic tale of romance: an arrogant upperclass woman (Sarah Ashley) journeys to Australia intent on selling her land, and meets a rugged man of the Outback (The Rover), whom she immediately despises.  Once she sees firsthand what is really going on here in ""the frontier,"" she determines to save her land - and to do so, she needs to drive her station's cattle herd thousands of miles to Darwin.  She teams up with The Rover, as well as a few other unlikely characters from her station - including the Aboriginal boy, Nullah - and together they begin an epic journey, which will take them not only through the rugged - and yet, extremely beautiful - Kimberly Outback, but on a journey of romance, discovery, and falling in love: with each other and with the land.

There are of course other themes at work here in the movie.  The struggle against the cattle baron, King Carney, who seeks to rule all of the Northern Territory.  The plight of the Aboriginal people, discrimination of both race and class, and the Lost Generation, those Aboriginal children taken from their parents to be raised in churches and missions in an effort to make them ""acceptable"" to society.

What did I love about this movie?  For one, the sweeping landscapes.  Australia can be harsh, but it is also a majestically beautiful land that not only takes your breath away, but makes you fall in love with it.  I feel the movie did a good job of portraying that, and helping the audience come to appreciate the vast beauty of this region.

It was also a great tear-jerker, for those who love classic movies and classic romance, full of many tender, romantic, redeeming, and heart-breaking moments.

And while Hugh Jackmand and Nicole Kidman did a fantastic job, and their romantic story really was the highlight of the film, I feel Nullah's story - the little Aboriginal boy played by Brandon Walters in his debut - truly stole the show.  In his big, soulful eyes, the true story of Australia and its people were captured, and you quickly find yourself cheering and praying and smiling with him every step of the way.  His performance was simply amazing, and if all else had been a disaster (which it wasn't!), it would have been worth seeing the movie just for him.

Personally, I also found the side story of Sergeant Callahan (played by Tony Barry) equally intriguing... a man clearly in love with the good Lady Ashley.  He was always there looking out for her, offering advice, and trying to save her, but always seemed to know he wasn't the man for her, and quietly stayed on the sidelines.  But, then, I've always been a sap for a good unrequited love story, so that might be why I enjoyed this side character so much.

What did I dislike?  While there was nothing about this movie I hated - I did rather enjoy it thoroughly - there was some room for improvement.  The length was just a little too long.  Some movies can get away with nearly three hours of screen time, but sadly Australia isn't one of them.  I understand the need and desire for all that occurs after the cattle drive, especially as the story if only half-told at that point, but I think the story could have been better served by being brought in a little bit.  I do realize that it was intended to be reminiscent of movies like Gone With The Wind, so the length is no doubt a conscious choice.

The movie also tries to tackle just a little too much, and so the central story gets a little lost in all of the side tales and themes.  I personally would have loved a little more focus on demonstrating how and why Sarah Ashley came to fall in love with the land - as an American who has visited Australia numerous times and fallen in love with the country, I felt that was an important theme!  But I confess, that could just be my personal opinion.

Regardless, though, Australia is a fabulous, sweeping epic worth seeing.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman bring to life a classic romance, and Brandon Walters steals the show as the soulful, loving Nullah.  Take the time this holiday season to go out and see Australia... and then, of course, plan your own journey down under to fall in love with this beautiful land.",1228521600,,5055,4.769230769230769
3756369,3,B001PPGAIK,"AUSTRALIA is a big, old-fashioned kind of epic that manages to entertain mildly on a very broad scale.  It's the kind of movie that made me think upon its conclusion, ""I liked it okay...but it's also a little weird and pointless that so much time and effort was put into such a ho-hum movie.""

I think part of the problem is that much of the film is trying to illuminate Australia's recent history of very ill treatment of ""mixed race"" aborigines.  Apparently, as World War II was nearing the country, there was a policy in place to round up these ""half breed"" children and separate them from their tribal roots...I guess to keep white genes out of the aboriginal gene pool.  Naturally, this is an outrageous policy that had terrible consequences.  It's the kind of thing that probably still leaves Australians today with bad feelings.  But in the movie AUSTRALIA, no true sense of outrage is achieved.  We feel bad for the characters who endure this racism, but it all feels kind of quaint, too.  We can ""tut-tut"" to ourselves about how bad things used to be...but the film is not exactly a call to action.

Frankly, the unsurpassed epic GONE WITH THE WIND stirs more outrage about the plight of enslaved African-Americans simply by NOT making an issue of their treatment.  To watch that film today, and to see the casual treatment of blacks as inferior is far more chilling (even though it wasn't deliberate).

Anyway, AUSTRALIA primarily concerns the rich English lady played by Nicole Kidman, who travels to Australia more or less in a fit of pique to check up on her errant husband and his cattle business.  She arrives to find that her husband has just died (perhaps in suspicious circumstances) and she is suddenly somewhat responsible for the ranch, the cattle and her husband's employees.  As all women in epics of this kind do, she decides she can learn this business and drive her cattle to town, just through sheer spunk.  She enlists Hugh Jackman (a cattle drover whose name also appears to be Mr. Drover) to lead the way.  And this earthy, ill-mannered man who has little use for women with spunk eventually gives in, and wouldn't you know it, the two even manage to fall passionately in love.

If I sound a little cynical in my tone, it's because virtually  nothing in the film comes as a surprise.  Will Kidman decide she has the right to be a rancher?  Will their cattle drive succeed in getting the cows into town ahead of  the mean, underhanded cattle tycoon (Bryan Brown) and HIS herd?  Will Kidman and Jackman fall in love?  Will they have many misadventures?  Will they both take a liking to the irrepressibly cute ""half breed"" child whose mother works on their staff?  Will they ""adopt"" him when his mother dies?

What makes the film work to any extent at all is that some of these dramatic archetypes (i.e. clich&eacute;s) still work.  The ""cattle-drive against the odds"" is as old as movies themselves...yet there is still something amazingly effective about them.  The stampedes, the chance to get to see the noble side of all your main characters.  The chance to see some magnificent countryside.  It just flat out works.  There are some quite powerful scenes during this segment, which is easily the best chunk of the film.

Later, WWII does strike the coastal town of Darwin, and Kidman, Jackman and the young boy are all imperiled and separated.  Daring rescues are needed.  The bad guys make things needlessly difficult, etc.  The town of Darwin is largely computer generated and the battle scenes are short and feel very, very uninspired.  These should be some of the climactic moments of the film...but they never really generate any significant suspense.

The film also plays around a bit with the ""magic"" of an aboriginal elder, the boy's grandfather.  He wants to boy to go with him on a walkabout...taking the first steps to manhood.  The boy is torn between his desire to follow his seemingly all-knowing grandfather...but he also wants to live with Kidman and Jackman and enjoy the ""easy"" lifestyle of these civilized folks.  This dilemma, I think, is supposed to help illuminate the greater themes of the film as a discussion of Australia's systematic racism.  In reality, though, I would say that it simply suggests that a harmony could be reached for these ""half breeds""...one that values both backgrounds, and thus should be an OPPORTUNITY for succeeding in both worlds, rather be an outcast from both.

The film is directed by Baz Luhrman, and I want to say right here and how that I am not a Luhrman fan.  I found MOULIN ROUGE to be almost unbearable to watch.  The endlessly droning, badly sung love songs.  The total lack of real chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Kidman.  The fantastical scenery that felt more and more like a Disneyland knockoff.

AUSTRALIA is certainly better...but it suffers from some similar problems.  Kidman and Jackman do a great job of playing as though they are in love and have the hots for each other.  They stare into each other's eyes a lot.  Jackman frequently crushes Kidman to his chest, just like on the cover of a bodice ripper.  They kiss with great fervor.  And yet I never once felt connected to their relationship.  I always like Jackman's easy demeanor...he seems like an amiable kind of fellow, and it's nice to see him working in his ""native"" Australian.  Kidman is a cold actress (and greatly over-rated)...but she does manage to evoke some laughs and some convincing spunkiness.  Yet as so often happens with her, she is unconvincing as a woman in love.  And to me, her two most unconvincing romantic efforts to date have been 1) MOULIN ROUGE & 2) AUSTRALIA.  She may love working with Baz Luhrman...but doing so isn't helping her.

If you see AUSTRALIA, chances are that you'll be entertained for its nearly 3 hour length.  But its impact on you will be brief and modest.",1228435200,,5867,4.752475247524752
3756370,4,B001PPGAIK,"saw australia over thanksgiving weekend.  liked it but not quite raving over it.

australia is sort of self-conscious and manipulative, with formulaic plot -- civilized woman adjusts to wild land and tames wild man and he tames her and together they battle the bad guys and keep the farm.  it milks sympathy for little smiling aboriginal kid (who is a good actor and scene stealer, btw) and brings home the history of the racial issues that australia faced.  it tries to sweep audience off its feet with big love story and nature scenes.  a modern aussie western and war flick all rolled into one.

movie shamelessly draws on GWTW and the wizard of oz (ironic given australia's nickname), both out in 1939, when movie starts, it takes place from 1939 until december of 1941.  shows sweeping vistas of australian outback, cliffs, waterfalls, and dusty cattle stations. and big final scene, japanese air attack
on darwin, which followed pearl harbor, is a spectacular and loud finish.

hugh jackman's main function in flick is to take off his shirt and bare his pecs and abs.  unfortunately, that is not nicole kidman's.  she plays ""lady ashley"" a ""fiercely independent"" spunky brit with beaucoup baggage full of unmentionables far from home, come to mind her late husband's cattle station.  hugh plays ""the drover,"" whom ""nobody hires and nobody fires"" until he meets you know who and helps her realize she doesn't need all those unmentionables down under (sorry for that one...).

they had pretty good, not great, chemistry; have commented on hugh's buffness, and nicole is as tall and thin as olive oyl, though, and seems to want to be known as a serious actress, even when the scene calls for her to be funny.  jane seymour is more my idea of what lady ashley ought to be, but she ain't an aussie, so nicole it is.

i recommend australia and give it four stars.  it is worth seeing even though it probably won't go down in history as another GWTW  see it in a theatre rather than renting it and watching it on a smaller tv if you can.",1228262400,,2036,4.676966292134831
3756371,5,B001PPGAIK,"Australia is the followup to Moulin Rouge but bigger antecedecents lie behind it, Gone with the Wind, Titanic, Doctor Zhivago, Reds, big pictures told on a national scale.  In fact I wonder what Australians make of Australia, which seems to involve just one patch of the continent (the Northern Territory), when you would think it would be possible to involve all the Australian states?  Anyhow the story is pretty vast as is, and basically it's held together by a pretty tough racialized storyline involving the ""stolen generations,"" aboriginal children claimed by the state and brought up in orphanages away from their families.

The story is told largely from the point of view of Nullah, son of an Aboriginal mother and a white dad, and therefore left feeling that he belongs nowhere.  Watched over from afar by his grandfather, little Nullah has a vague, pagan sense of cause and effect; for an American speaker his imagery of singing and fate and a violent liberty seems intoxicatingly difficult and offkilter, and maybe this soupcon of the unknown (even the ""exotic"" if you will) gives the otherwise stock romantic plot between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman a new dimension.  After all, one can no longer believe that the romantic trials of a drover and an aristocratic Mrs. Boss should take central stage when so much else is going on in the world--so much injustice and so much bigoted cruelty.

Kidman's character arc as Lady Sarah Ashley is like something out of an 80s'Goldie Hawn movie--pampered princess learns about life as it's lived in the dirt--but I suppose it was Scarlett O'Hara's too, tearing into the earth for a single turnip and swearing never to go hungry again.  Meanwhile a parade of Australia's top actors, including Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, David Wenham, and even David Gulpilil (from Walkabout, The Last Wave, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Crocodile Dundee) take minor and major roles, so the movie also has some of the fun factor of George Stevens' Greatest Story Ever Told, with John Wayne as the Centurion.  There isn't one thing about Australia I didn't love--except for the horrid Elton John song that plays over the final credits.  Why, Baz, why, was this some secret gay tradeoff?  Outside of that gaffe, I spent the last hour and a half of the movie in tears, it was like the heavens opened and rained on my face, and I can barely remember a time when I did not live in Darwin and squadrons of highly trained Japanese pilots were not pouring down colorful bombs and destroying every evil person in town and breaking the prisons wide open.

There weren't too many people in the theater when I saw Australia and I hope this isn't a sign of the movie not doing well.  It has had some totally unfair reviews.  Then I recall that the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth times I saw Moulin Rouge the theater wasn't all that packed either.

Those reviews made me think, going in, that I wouldn't be enjoying the film, and I can report that this was not the case.  It was fantastic and beautiful and wonderfully done.  OK, it's not for everyone.  But for me, it was the movie of the year and I only wish that Elton had just said, no thanks Baz Luhrmann.",1228176000,2,3186,4.732368896925859

I felt like I was experiencing something I had never experienced before. This was a beautifu story filled with lots of humor, adventure, romance, drama, and even some education on things I never knew anything about. The young actor who play Nullah was just amazing. His character added so much to the story. I might as well add how marvelous Hugh Jackman is in this film. This performance should really put him on the map. He is such a wonderful actor and I am glad he finally got such a great role (along with playing Wolverine). He is also perfect for this role and it sure aint bad to look at either. This was even better than I expected it would be. The cinematography was gorgeous and the story was so rich and beautiful. I was totally taken in from the get-go.

3756375,3,B001PPGAIK,"I'll admit being hard on this film due to initial high hopes.  After hearing about the Australian government's apologies for the Stolen Generation, I started thinking Luhrmann's project may have helped lead to that.  For a film claiming to have been initially inspired by the story of aborigine discrimination and mistreatment, it's surprisingly secondary to the film itself, comprising the minority of the performances and story...no pun intended.  I'd have much rather seen a film about a white man, a black woman, and their offspring than an attempt to water it down and use as a gimmick.  How appalling we should think that ""unmarketable"" in this day in age.

While I generally have no problem with the lightness, humor, or overt Hollywoodness Luhrmann was going for, it just didn't quite mesh with the overall mood or tone of the film.  I also don't think it helped make Nicole Kidman's character as likeable as it could have.  This tends to make the romantic chemistry even more lacking.  Ordinarily we should feel much more sympathy for a woman who's just lost her husband, and thus be more empathetic and taken-in by the events surrounding her later.  I think instead we get something closer to Scarlet O'Hara, who frankly none of the audience was supposed to really give a damn about.  It's not that bad here, but this early choice has detrimental effects.

The heavy use of CGI was further disappointing.  It had that extreme washed-out bright highlights quality to much of it, with that artificial foggy, dusty, blurry background from post-production tampering.  The closest look is that of the films Pearl Harbor and Indiana Jones & the Crystal Skulls...and not the non-CGI cave scenes from the latter, some of which were simply printed optically.  Combined with Luhrmann's need to cram everything within a single frame all the time that he inherited from his work on the stage, not to mention some of the stage-like lighting (strong backlights upon the hair at night, uniform color tints to background, etc) it just often looked rather synthetic.

Structurally there is a serious flaw regarding timeline here.  Jackman's character is based on a real person.  The aborigine history is accurate.  The attack on the town of Darwin did happen.  However, the choice to put a two year gap between the cattle driving event and what is (which I will explain next) a fourth act, is baffling.  The child hasn't aged and there's an unnecessarily poor segue using newspaper clippings and newsreels to bring us up to date.  All this just as our bottoms are beginning to ache or the need to use the toilet (as Hitchcock put it) chimes in.

Thus the solution would have been to shave off about 20 minutes to a half hour removing the written introduction, shortening the kisses (they all last a few beats too long), no thanking of the bartender at the end, making all slow-motions normal speed (a nauseating number of them), losing many extraneous shots & scenes, and tightening up every take's edit.  By putting the cattle driving section in 1941, you can also drop the aforementioned segue and more naturally lead into a proper third act without having ""blown the cinematic load"", to use a crude but efficient phrase, in an overly long first two-thirds.  The triumphant cattle drive would end act two, sufficiently joyful but not so cathartically exhausting that the Japanese attack is akin to Frodo leaving with the fairies after the audience is getting up to leave.  Out of Africa needed to be long.  Australia did not.

A final word on plastic surgery:
Please, women of Hollywood,
Think twice about cosmetic surgery & ""procedures""...at least before you need it.  When things are really going south, no one's going to complain.  But this collagen in the lips thing has gotten out of hand.  Uma Thurman had a little work done recently with unexpectedly outstanding & admittedly rare results, but revealingly, very little of it had to do with her lips.  The results were also one in a thousand.  I'm not going to deride a little conservative augmentation here or tuck there, but some of this alteration of the face is just baffling.  I like full lips as much as the next guy, but overtly swollen, bee-sting lips are not sexy.  To quote the Princess Bride, ""There's a shortage of perfect (fill-in-the-blank) in this world.  It would be a pity to damage yours.""",1228003200,2,4358,4.867028493894166
3756376,4,B001PPGAIK,"In an epic turn for Baz Luhrmann, he doesn't disappoint his audience, but he is no longer able to knock his viewers off their feet either. The movie is spectacular and must be watched on the big screen and, yet, I have reservations recommending it outright. It's a longer film, clocking in at over 2 and 3/4 hours. The beginning of the film is intense and captivating and the movie could've easily been about the first part of the film. However, Baz isn't the one to give in to traditional formula and standard filmmaking, and goes on to expand the story and layer it with more magnificence and historical backdrop. The movie is visually stunning in its cinematography and costume design (as is to be expected from a Luhrmann production) and the cast is good to look at it too. Casting is particularity well chosen and both Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman act with grace and intelligence and ease. Kidman's performance will be recognized mightily come awards time, but it is Brandon Walters (in his debut role as Nullah, the character who represents the movie's main subplot of the Stolen Generation) who steals the show. Overall, this is atypical Lurhmann film, but it's also atypical Hollywood film and it's this unusual quality that makes it not only unique but highly watchable and immensely entertaining (and not for everyone).",1228003200,,1331,4.842105263157895

""Out of Africa"", ""The Man from Snowy River"", ""Gone with the wind"", ""Empire of the Sun"", are all copied and adapted to fit the history of Australia.  Even the majestic landscape of the epynomous title are not able to escape abuse.  CGI Kangaroos, Cattle, Airplanes, Ships, Islands, and Cities abound.

Australia lacks some trademarks of earlier Luhrmann films--there are no psychedelic trips or fast camera cuts here--but his vision is still apparent.

3756382,5,B001PPGAIK,"You often hear people lament that ""they just don't make them like they used to.""  Baz Luhrmann proves those people wrong.

In the early days of World War II, Sarah, Lady Maitland Ashley (Nichole Kidman), has flown from England to Australia to track down her husband, whom she assumes is philandering on his hobby ranch a continent away from his duties and responsibilities.  Ignoring repeated cablegrams from Lord Ashley warning her not to come; Lady Ashley arrives in Darwin expecting to be met by Lord Ashley's representative, the Drover (Hugh Jackman).  When she does not find her expected escort at the gate, Lady Ashley strides into town only to find her husband's ""trusted man"" engaged in a stupendous bar fight that has spilled into the street.  Despite this inauspicious introduction, she manages to overcome her distaste for the Drover in her determination to press on and reach the cattle station.

Lady Ashley intends to sell off the ranch and bring her husband home.  However, her plans change when she finally arrives at the station to find she has been just made a widow.  The foreman, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), offers to broker a deal for the Ashley's land and stock with the local cattle baron, King Carney, and take her back to Darwin so she can catch the next plane back to England.

Nullah (Brandon Walters), a half Aborigine child who lives at the ranch, lets her know that the best of her unbranded cattle have been driven across the river and merged into King Carney's herd.  When Sarah mentions this to Fletcher, he almost persuades her that the child is mistaken.  But when she sees him raise his hand and threaten the boy she strikes Fletcher with her riding crop and fires him on the spot.

Lady Ashley must now bring 1500 head of cattle to Darwin in order to secure a contract to supply beef to the Australian military.  If she fails she faces utter ruin.

""Australia"" has a cattle drive, complete with stampede; an innocent man falsely accused of murder; a lovely, aristocratic heroine and a rugged, handsome hero who, while they initially dislike each other, eventually fall in love; a kid who seems artlessly adorable; a magic man; and an extremely hissable villain who plots against them at every turn.  If our cast of characters hasn't endured enough already, there is the Japanese bombing of Darwin.

This is a film that will appeal to a wide range of audiences.  It has a coherent plot, solid acting, and the overall cinematography is breathtaking despite some awkward CGI moments and several shots lifted directly from ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" reused for the Darwin sequence.  Although ""Australia"" is 165 minutes long, it is never tedious.
