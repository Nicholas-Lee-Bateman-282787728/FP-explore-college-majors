8704783,2,B00U9VAQHW,Ok I really got taken. Looked like it would be a rare underground from the 80's but it was just a small group of fetish artists performing in monster make up.,1481846400,,158,4.129032258064516
8704784,4,B00U9VAQHW,"""Sexandroide"" is a French 'film' made in 1987 that attempts to mix horror and eroticism.  How successfully this blend has been achieved may ultimately be a matter of personal taste.  Por moi - I found the imagery & concepts to be 'interesting' if not particularly 'inspired'. Given the time of the film's original release some of the things depicted were pretty avante-garde.

The format presents 3 separate, unconnected, segments that all feature naked women and some 'horror' element.

The first scene is, perhaps, the most imaginative - in it: a woman at a bar is affected by a remote individual who is inexplicably tormenting her via a wax voodoo doll. The woman takes refuge in a lavatory and is compelled to rip her own clothes off and is then subjected to a series of 'tortures' as the unseen voodoo manipulator pokes and prods the wax effigy in a variety of 'intimate' areas.  Pretty creepy & bloody!

The second vignette follows a lanky brunette down into a satanic basement setting where she dances around and flagellates herself a little before she is set upon by a demonic individual whose make-up, strangely, reminded me of the look of the flying monkey creatures in the old 'Wizard of Oz'.  This segment featured a lot of cringe-worthy graphic depictions of long needles thrust through sensitive body parts on the naked woman, eyeball gouging, bowie knife carving, and even a depiction of hari-kari!  I particularly appreciated this 'act' because it had an authentic 'Grand Guignol-esque' feel to it - seemingly recreating the experience one might have had at that infamous Victorian period Parisian 'theatre of horreur & comedy'. This is emphasized as the 2 'actors' in the piece stand up and 'take a bow' at the end of their torturous sequence...  It was quite satisfying (in a sick & depraved way).

The final episode of the perverse trilogy is the most mundane in terms of 'horrific' content.  An attractive, ashen faced, widow sits by a coffin, until the vampiric 'corpse' pops out of it and rips her clothes off. The, totally nude, dancer then basically does an 80's style 'stripper' act next to a coffin for an extended period. Any guy who has ever sat thru a typical strip-bar show  will recognize all of 'the moves' and the camera does not 'shy away' from from any of the action - making this the most explicitly erotic of the scenes... somewhat reminiscent of similar sequences in director Ed Wood's: ""Orgy of the Dead"".  It should be generally noted that, although full female nudity is abundant, there is no XXX porn action (in the original French film).

Interestingly, there is no verbal dialog in any of the segments (no pesky sub-titles to detract from the viewing experience) - the sound trak consists of music and a lot of panting, screaming,  grunts and groans - as appropriate to whatever bit of weirdness is transpiring on screen at the moment.  While this, relatively brief, Franco foray into erotic-horror doesn't really have much to recommend it beyond its' hefty dose of full female nudity - in THAT department it scores admirably and could be considered as a 'fun' watch by the sort of bent individuals who gravitate to this type of (s)exploitational strangeness.

The visual quality of the DVD transfer is 'appropriately' grainy but good. The 'extras' include some (even grainier) scenes from a version of the film duped from a Japanese VHS release that featured additional XXX footage not actually related to the original French release, This, fairly lengthy, series of scenes appear to be out-takes from some European made hardcore BDSM movies - a male midget is a prominent player in several segments.  Because these clips were in a Japanese release they are 'plagued' with the annoying digital censorship that is imposed on much Japanese hardcore material and make the sex scenes difficult to watch - but it is nice that the DVD authors thought to include them!  There are also some trailers for other 'Massacre Video' oddities.  Gratuitously vacuous as it may be - I liked it!",1433203200,,4022,4.886764705882353
8704785,5,B00U9VAQHW,"I honestly am not sure what I just watched. Like the first reviewer here said, it's a series of vignettes, and that is it. Zero plot and no dialog outside of some screams, grunts, moans, and laughing. The special effects, all practical, are not that bad. There were some in the second vignette that looked to be real. My only complaint, so to speak, is that the setup for the first two scenes is slow and rather pointless.

To be honest, the one and only reason to watch this, is for the nudity. All 3 girls are nude, most of the time. They look to be all natural, and are un-shaved, which fans of 70-80's horror and adult features, like myself, will appreciate more. None of these women are shy, showing just about every inch of their body. Not sure if the first girl is in more features, but I would like to watch more of her. The other two, while ok, just are not attractive as the first, in my opinion anyway. I hate to comment on the looks of the women, but like I said before, this is the only reason to watch.

If you are up for a bit more, there are some ""missing scenes"" in the extras. Apparently they are from the Japanese VHS release of this movie. They are scenes that as far as I know, were not even shot by the director. They are porn scenes that were added, maybe to pad out the run time? These are, for the most part, hardcore scenes. Now being that the vhs was a Japanese release, there is optical blur, pixellation and item placement to obscure the actual hardcore inserts. Again, this has nothing to do with the movie itself, so I can see why it was left out of the full release.

I am really not saying anything the first reviewer hasn't already said, but I just felt compelled to write about this. I don't even know why. Maybe because it truly is an odd piece of cinema. It isn't even very good, but I really did enjoy it. I think my jaw dropped during some of the scenes because they were just so ""out there"". I had to give it 5 stars because it's so far removed from all the Hollywood garbage we are subjected to now days. I am a big fan of Massacre video, and I hadn't heard of this before they released it. I bought it blind and I am glad I did. Truly odd.",1431129600,3,2181,4.15130023640662
8704786,4,B00U9VAQHW,"What is this movie?  The answer: it's not really a movie.  Without spoiling things, the movie is three vignettes.  There isn't a single word of dialogue in all of this.  It's not a story, it's almost like a paegent of women getting naked, being naked, and being tortured/injured/and bloodied by a ghoul guy.  There it is.

If you're trying to figure out why this was made, or the thought process behind it, don't injure yourself.  It is what it is.  Gore and naked babes.  The last vignette with the cheesy rocking number and dancing nude chick says it all.  If you can wallow in disgusting gore and nudity, it's trying to be fun, and not deadly serious, though the graphic nature of mixing eroticism and gore will put off most of the universe.

So it's not a movie you watch for story.  It's not even one you watch to enjoy adult material.  It's the very definition of an oddity in the gross annals of cinema.  It's one for study, not necessarily popcorn muching fun.

And the extras involving the Japanese cut of the film adds arguement to how this movie is really an cult oddity.  Man, it doesn't get any stranger and obscure than this movie.

Normal everyday people: 0 stars
Horror fans: 2
Gutter slime: 5

And somehow I get 4 stars out of that.  Don't bother if you have no idea what you're getting into.",1430956800,,1309,4.447257383966245
