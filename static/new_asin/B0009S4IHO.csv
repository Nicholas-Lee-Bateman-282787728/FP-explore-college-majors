2317299,3,B0009S4IHO,"I was a teenager when the show was on.  I liked it. It had enough drama to hold my interest without being sex filled. For a lot of paarents, this is an important issue: just what can my kid watch that is decent.  I remember this show qualifying.",1123027200,5,245,4.083333333333333
2317300,5,B0009S4IHO,"I loved this show back in the day! I'm biased because I'm a huge Star Trek/Shatner fan. We hail from the same home town and my dad went to school with the guy. So he's always been a local hero.

So when Shatner donned a bluesuit, I was right there from the first episode. And I was pleased to see that the show was really Captain Kirk walking a beat! What a treat back then to be able to tune in and see Kirk in-between Star Trek movies! And the episode with Leonard Nimoy alone is worth the price of the set. Just to see Shatner and Nimoy together outside of Trek is a treat! And George Costanza's Yankee boss is Hooker's boss as well. How about that?

Now I know the show is campy and completely unrealistic, but that shouldn't take away from viewer's enjoyment. Shatner loves to deliver speeches about decency and honor and obeying the law. These are great moments and speak a truth people tend to roll their eyes at these days for some reason. This show is fantasy. A fantasy about how cops should be: caring, dedicated, honest, hardworking, part of the community. I know this is all but impossible in the real world, which is why it's nice to see on TV every now and then.

Time has aged the show, and this also works in its favor. The clothes, the hair, the crude action sequences. Sure they can't hold a candle to what's being done on television these days (The Shield) but they were state of the art at the time and there is a nostalgic charm to them now. It's funny to watch all of the episode previews all at once and see how many times Hooker/Romano are helping injured people away from vehicles about to blow up. This happens about every 2 or 3 episodes.

My only knock against this set is the lack of special features. The lack of these on any set always scream ""cash grab"" to me. Let's get the thing out as cheaply as possible and rake in the profits. This is a shame. Aside from the previews, there's nothing extra. The picture quality is very good, which is nice. But where are the interviews, commentaries, picture gallery, merchandise gallery, etc. This show was a hit don't forget. It got put through the promotional machine just like any other top show. I hope future seasons will have some extras.

So if you are looking for some viewing entertainment, then this is the set for you. It's a fantasy, it's charmingly dated, it attempts a Dragnet-like holiness, it's entertaining. It won't change the world but it will provide a few hours of pleasant TV viewing. Nothing wrong with that.",1119139200,3,2505,4.425162689804773
2317301,5,B0009S4IHO,"This was and is one of the best cop shows ever. William Shatner, Adrian Zmed, Heather Locklear and my favorite James Darren. The story lines were good and great acting.

But on the cover for season one and two, you see James Darren on the cover but not his name on top. They need to add his name.

He was one of the reasons I watched this show. I watch this show evernight on tv and it is on at 4am.  I cannot wait to get this DVD and hope I don't have to wait too long for season 3 & 4.

Thanks for puting this on DVD.",1118361600,10,519,3.7777777777777777

2317304,4,B0009S4IHO,"Have watched first 4 episodes , a little rough around the edges and a bit different from what I remember around 1984 or so.
Great for Shatner fans , as he does his thing : overacts , underacts , runs, fights - it looks like he does he own stunts .
Dialogue not as dated as one might think , though the stereotyping wouldn't cut it today .
The cliched plot lines in 1982 are actually  refreshing to watch today and it's nice that the actors don't whisper to each other , insult each other and mean it, like today!
Haven't gotten to heather locklears years and when Shatners character developed and matured . Still a sturdy , confidant FOUR !
Crystal clear audio and video .",1493596800,,672,4.291338582677166

2317308,5,B0009S4IHO,"Love TJ Hooker.  Sometimes when I watch my DVDs, I do think he can go over the top when he jumps onto cars or the roof of a bus.  But he's always determined to get his man and bring him to justice.  I think the minor storylines give good humor to the show.  Like the little bits of TJ's divorced wife and kids.  It make TJ Hooker more real than fiction.  My most favorite of the series is when they became four with Stacy, Jim, Romano, and Hooker.  All of them getting involved in storylines made the episode more interesting to me.  Loved the relationship all of them developed between each other.  Good cop show.  William Shatner is a wonderful actor and did this show justice.  It's worth the buy.  And, for me, I knew James Darren could definitely sing, but I didn't know what a great actor he is until I watched him in the episodes.",1490054400,2,837,4.261146496815287

Two complaints. First the cases the DvDs come in are junk and the plastic tabs that hold the CDs in the cases broke on the first use. Additionally, the episode lists on the back covers are inaccurate. They indicate certain episodes are on the CDs but they aren't. It's inconvenient, but not the end of the world. The show is worth the minor things and I highly recommend this set.",1454544000,,591,4.422018348623853

2317334,5,B0009S4IHO,"I've been revisiting shows I watched in the '80s and discovered that some have definitely failed the test of time but not T.J. Hooker.  I was pleasantly surprised that the issues covered in the first two seasons are just as relevant today as they were 30+ years ago.  While never a fan of Shatner as Capt. Kirk, the title role of this series was a perfect fit for this stage of his career.  Aside from the obvious objectification of Heather Locklear's character and excessive vehicle explosions (typical of Goldberg and Spelling), the characters and situations are well-written and relatively accurate.  I'm looking forward to watching the remaining seasons, once they become available.",1454284800,,686,5.098214285714286

2317337,4,B0009S4IHO,"I bought this show on a whim, as I was looking for something different to watch, and the price was on budget.  I've always liked William Shatner, but didn't know what to expect.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  The episodes are a bit gritty at times, but I have more respect for our Police Force after watching it.  I never really thought of the emotional weight of the job, and the struggles that officers experience when, even though they did their duty and were responsibile to do the right thing, the bad guy get off.  It made me realize how they could so easily be hardened by the 'if onlys'.  ""If only I'd killed him when I had a chance, he wouldn't be able to hurt anyone else again.""  You can't help but feel for those who choose to do the right thing.",1453161600,2,763,4.293706293706293

2317340,5,B0009S4IHO,"During these crazy times when police shootings stay in the headlines, this is a great show to watch to get an understanding from the perspective of the uniformed police officers.  It's a crazy world out there and seemingly getting crazier by the day.

The officers do an amazing job daily,  putting their lives on the line to serve and protect as they have been sworn to do. Unfortunately like in all professions there are a few bad apples; only because these bad apple have a gun do the odds go against an innocent party.  This show demonstrates how easily it can happen. As well as how vulnerable the cops can be when they show up unaware of all the circumstances in a very dangerous situation.

If you enjoy the cop/forensic shows from the 70s, like SWAT, Columbo, Quincy ME, The FBI, and Adam 12. Stories produced by Spelling  and Goldberg were quality made, still showing revelance to current times. The picture quality is excellent as well as the sound.

The only disappointment is that there were only two seasons. The first one was very short.  This is some very good TV that I will be watching again.  You get to know the reoccurring characters and want to know what is going to happen next in their lives.

Buy it, it's cheap! But don't let the price fool you it is worth several times the cost. An added bonus is you get to see TV stars in their youth (the beginning of their careers), including William Shatner.

Crank up the DVD player and get ready for some enjoyment.

2317375,3,B0009S4IHO,"I just rated and reviewed ""Aftermath,"" particularly the episode featuring Mary Kay Letourneau.  In that review, I discussed how William Shatner improved his already stellar acting chops by starring in ""T. J. Hooker,"" or this fine mess of a show.  How can his ex-intergalactic co-stars from ""Star Trek"" call him names, such as a ""blowhard"" or a ""narcissist,"" especially after watching this incredible series?  Perhaps it's just jealousy.  Jealousy that he got to hang out with one Heather Locklear.

Now, I think Ms. Locklear's one of the hottest gals ever.  Take Farrah Fawcett, make her better looking, give her a brain, get rid of the whole ""cancer of the you-know-where thing"" -- too soon? -- and you have Ms. Locklear.  In reality, Ms. Locklear's the only reason to watch this series.  You've heard of ""Fifth season of Night Court Lame"" drummed up by the creators of ""South Park"" I believe?  Well, this show is ""First Season of T. J. Hooker Lame,"" ""Second Season of T. J. Hooker Lamer,"" ""Third Season of T. J. Hooker Lamest,"" etc.  Oops!  There were two more seasons, so it only got worse, and I'm running out of ""ers"" and ""estes.""  This is probably why only the first couple of seasons are available for streaming.  Most people aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer, but they are sharp enough to know that this show cuts to the mental quick after knifing their way through the first two seasons or so.

Here is dialog that might actually occur on this show, in some very abbreviated scenes, since the writers did show some mercy:

(Begin scene.)

Hooker:  Did you get a good look at the perp?  Or do we have to call-in forensics to pull prints and draw semen out of the vic?

Romano:  No, I got a good look at him, I can guarantee you that.  And I know his MO and his signature too.  As you already know, Hook, I studied profiling under John Douglas, so I could have figured out this guy in my sleep.  His serial killing days and his leaving disgusting bio hazards at a crime scene are over.

(End scene.)

But in reality, say you're these two hotshots, and you've got Ms. Locklear tagging along in the backseat for the ride.  Would you remember anything about the criminal?  Any criminal?  Here's how it would really go down, if the script were honest:

(Begin scene.)

Hooker:  (Same as above.  Hey, I don't like typing.)

Romano:  Hell no!  Are you crazy?  I was checking out the rack on Stacy and I don't remember a damned thing!

(End scene.)

Naturally, if I were one of the writers of ""Hooker,"" this show would have been killer.  As it is, it's more, like, well, a biohazard at a disgusting crime scene.",1417564800,2,2618,4.560344827586207

People have noted the wrong way the episodes on each of the 6 DVD's is wrong on the box package which rest assured is only that and all of the episodes really are here.

...My memory of this show was very vague and it is quite interesting to see how some things in it are very politically incorrect in this post 2010 world..eg: Sergeant Thomas Jefferson ""T.J."" Hooker drinks and drives in the pilot

All the stables that were asked for filming permission said no--the horses would be totally freaked out. Finally, a Saddlebred trainer gave permission to use his barn and horses. Shatner was amazed at the sensible behavior of the Saddlebreds and their acceptance of all the whoop-de-do going on in their barn. It led to Shatner's purchase of Saddlebreds and a farm in Kentucky from where he actually showed his horses himself.

Factory has just announced Season 2 of The Rookies will be released on DVD, and I'm sure that they could license T.J. Hooker as well if Sony will be reasonable in their asking price.

RELEASE THE REST OF THE SERIES ON DVD STARTING WITH SEASON 3 THIS YEAR!  It can be done.  There is enough demand to make it a profitable release.  No, it won't sell millions of copies making it a gold mine, but it can be profitable if everyone is reasonable.

Come on Sony!  You can make this happen with no financial risk to yourselves!  License T.J. Hooker out to Shout and make the Hooker trained fans happy.

2317420,5,B0009S4IHO,"I recently got ""back into"" TJ Hooker...I was 10-14 when the show originally aired. I gave it 5 stars because of my love for the show. However, I am dissapointed to learn that this season 1,2 dvd was released in 2005 (as of this writing its 2011), and there are no future plans to release the other 3 seasons on dvd. As mentioned before, the episode listings and actual dvds do not match. I was also dissapointed to see no real bonus features...namely commentaries, behind the scenes, and bloopers.
As far as the show goes, it's basically your typical 80's television unrealistic cop show. As a police officer myself, I find it humourous at how everything works out so nicely...and how Hooker kills someone on almost every episode with no follow ups involved. No paperwork, no lawsuits, no questions or interigations by the admin, ect. I also find it...""odd"", that even though in Southern California (presumably Los Angeles, even though the patches have a fictious ""LCPD"" logo), that their department apparently has no short sleeve policy. All officers (well, all 4 of them who actually patrol) are always in Class A uniforms (long sleeves and tie).

2317421,3,B0009S4IHO,"This collection consists of the first and second seasons of the well-known 1980s police drama.  The first consisted of a mere six episodes; the second ran for a full year.  Set in Los Angeles, this show was originally developed as a vehicle for William Shatner, playing an experienced officer who mentors the younger generation.  The scriptwriting was very uneven at first, although it would improve markedly during the third and fourth seasons.  There were several problems, ranging from poorly-conceived plots to shallow, simplistic characters.  Shatner plays the proverbial tough guy with a heart of gold who spouts anti-crime rhetoric.  His new partner (Adrian Zmed) is portrayed as a frustrated entrepreneur.  The female roles (first April Clough, later Heather Locklear) were completely undeveloped.  Toward the end of the second season, the show would change for the better.  The right-wing rhetoric was abandoned, Heather Locklear's role was expanded, Adrian Zmed's role became more professional, and veteran actor James Darren came on board, creating more of an ensemble cast.  By the third season, T.J. Hooker had become one of the better crime dramas on television, but unfortunately, only the first two seasons have been released on DVD.",1294617600,5,1249,5.391752577319588
2317422,5,B0009S4IHO,"Okay, I hopped onto the TJ Hooker bandwagon later than most people (as in, a month ago) when I found a well-reviewed cop drama on iTunes. I watched one episode and was hooked (no pun intended). I love the fact it's all about the characters, not the action. You really become a part of the professional and private lives of a handful of police officers as they go about their business.

And I love William Shatner's tough-yet-human portrayal of a veteran cop on the beat. I didn't think it'd be as good as it is. He has his moments, but that's all a part of the charm. The episodes follow a formula, but the writers were never afraid to take risks with story or character.

I ordered seasons 1 & 2 so I could enjoy more episodes. The combined DVD collection had been out since 2005, and (having waited about 4 years before I could have every season of The Rockford Files) I thought at least seasons 3 and 4 would be available to the general public by now.

2317430,4,B0009S4IHO,"TJ HOOKER was an awesome police drama about a divorced Vietnam veteran & former police investigator named Sgt. Thomas Jefferson Hooker(William Shatner) who transfers back to patrol to combat more criminals on the streets who also taught cadets at the police academy barracks part-time and had often butted heads with his often skeptical superior officer Capt. Dennis Sheridan(Richard Herd)and partnered with a young hunky, often short-tempered European rookie patrolman Officer Vince Romano(Adrian Zmed) who was also Hooker's good pal on and off duty, which made them like an upgraded carbon-copy of Los Angeles police Officers Pete Malloy(Martin Milner)& Jim Reed(Kent McCord) on ADAM-12 and also made Hooker & Romano a tad similar to California Highway Patrol Officers Ponch(Erik Estrada) and Jon(Larry Wilcox)on CHiPs.

In fact, I used to watch this cop drama every Saturday night on ABC as a kid when it became an instant smash back in the Spring of 1982 when CHiPs was in its 5th Season on NBC & when ABC brought TJ HOOKER back on the air by popular demand for a 2nd Season in September of 1982 just before NBC kicked off CHiPs 6th Season in October of 1982 along with the fact that this police drama also helped make the popular hot blonde bombshell(Heather Locklear) a superstar while Locklear was becoming famous while already playing the sexy Sammy-Jo on DYNASTY at the same time which was of course before Locklear's co-starring days as the sassy bitch(Amanda Woodward)on MELROSE PLACE.

T.J. HOOKER was one of the best cop shows of the 80's and probably Bill Shatner's best show and performance since STAR TREK, but I noticed this police drama took a real nose-dive when Romano left the show since it led to a big slump in the ratings, but prior to Romano's departure from TJ HOOKER, this cop drama had gotten even better when Heather Locklear joined the case & crew of the show as Capt. Sheridan's foxy daughter & rookie officer(Stacey Sheridan) in T.J. HOOKER's 2nd Season replacing her predecessor Officer Vicki Taylor(April Clough) and then this police drama improved even more when Stacey's ornery partner Officer Jim Corrigan(James Darren)had joined the cast and crew of the show in the 3rd Season when Capt. Sheridan departed the show, but I'm sure part of what contributed to this shows cancellation in the Spring of 1986 was T.J. HOOKER had started running out of steam when Romano departed the show and when CBS tried to prolong the series in the Fall of 1985 on CBS Crime Time Late Night after ABC had cancelled TJ HOOKER previously in the Summer of 1985.

However, I would still have to say that Officer Stacey Sheridan(Heather Locklear)was the real fox of the show and still the best looking character and co-star on TJ HOOKER to this very day as well as the sexiest officer on TV at the time and was even sexier looking than California Highway Patrol Officers Bonnie Clark(Randi Oakes), Sindy Cahill(Brianne Leary), and Kathy Linahan(Tina Gayle)on CHiPs all were, which was probably due to the fact that Heather Locklear was a lot younger than they all were too.

I also think Romano and Stacey would've been a great looking couple since Stacey and Romano always seemed to have a chemistry between one another since they often teased and flirted with each other quite a bit during the 2nd thru 4th Seasons of TJ HOOKER, but I'm almost surprised that Romano and Stacey never became an item.

Unfortunately, the series tanked after it's 4-year run on ABC when Adrian Zmed left the show after the Spring of 1985 to pursue other projects leaving us mourning the loss of Romano by making TJ HOOKER go from a foursome to only a threesome which left Hooker riding solo without a partner and sometimes even had Hooker working with Sheridan and Corrigan as a 3-officer team instead of a 4-officer team when they didn't have Romano anymore which really sucked, especially in Romano's absence.

Something else I noticed about this show was Hooker always seem to run kind of funny during a foot pursuit and could never seem to quite run as well as his other co-stars on this cop drama, especially Romano.

Now that Sony has already come out with TJ HOOKER'S first 2 seasons on DVD, I don't see what's taking them so long to bring out the remaining 3 seasons out on DVD, starting with TJ Hooker's 3rd Season, since Sony hasn't even released another season of TJ HOOKER since the Summer of 2005, but I suspect that it may perhaps be due to the fact that this DVD box set didn't sell too good and/or because of today's sluggish economy.

However, I would've figured that they would've had the rest of TJ HOOKER's seasons released on DVD by now since TJ HOOKER was such a popular police drama just like CHiPs, ADAM-12, DRAGNET, HUNTER, HILL STREET BLUES, etc.; all were.

For instance Universal already has the first 4 seasons of ADAM-12 out on DVD, Warner Bros. already has the first 2 seasons of CHiPs out on DVD, and Anchor Bay already has the first 3 seasons of HUNTER out on DVD.

In addition to what baffles me about Sony not having any of the remaining seasons of T.J. HOOKER released on DVD yet, starting with TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season, TJ HOOKER was not only a top 10 show in the early 1980's, T.J. HOOKER even had higher ratings than CHiPs did during TJ HOOKER's first 2 seasons on ABC along with the fact that TJ HOOKER seemed to have stolen some of CHiPs thunder back then,especially since TJ HOOKER was in its honeymoon phase of the show when it made its debut on ABC in March of 1982 while CHiPs honeymoon phase was already long gone along with the fact that between the Fall of 1982 and the Summer of 1983 the Nielsen ratings on TJ HOOKER were still rising at an all-time high while the ratings on CHiPs were sinking to an all-time low, which eventually contributed to NBC cancelling CHiPs in July of 1983.

Therefore you could say that TJ HOOKER K.O.'d CHiPs in the ratings along with every other police drama on TV at the time too.

In addition to what made TJ HOOKER more popular than CHiPs, TJ HOOKER seemed to be more realistic & more convincing than CHiPs too since Ponch and Jon, nor even any of their fellow Chippies never used their guns or deadly force while busting or pursuing a suspect, unlike Hooker and all his fellow police officers who have sometimes had to even shoot to kill like on ADAM-12, DRAGNET, and HUNTER.

Something else that led to CHiPs cancellation while TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season was underway for its 3rd Season in the Fall of 1983 was the departure of Ponch's first partner(California Highway Patrol Officer Jon Baker)who left CHiPs in the Spring of 1982 while CHiPs 6th Season was in the works on NBC and TJ HOOKER's 2nd Season was in the works on ABC for the Fall of 1982 when Stacey replaced previous co-star(April Clough) and when Tom Reilly joined the cast & crew of CHiPs replacing Jon as Ponch's new hot-dog rookie partner(California Highway Patrol Officer Bobby Nelson) since the ratings on CHiPs took a massive nose-dive when Jon left the show & when Bobby came along since Ponch and Bobby didn't have the same kind of chemistry that Ponch and Jon had together along with the fact that Ponch didn't seem to have nearly as much in common with Bobby as he did with Jon either,despite the fact that Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada didn't get along in real life and had constant rivaly behind the set of CHiPs,which was Larry Wilcox's reason for departing the show in May of 1982, but Wilcox and Estrada were able to patch up their differences and become friends years later before they made the CHiPs reunion movie ""CHiPs 99"",which reminds me that I can't understand why they haven't made a TV reunion movie for TJ HOOKER yet.

Something else about this police drama that I never quite understood about this show was what the LCPD stood for since that was the fictional police department that Hooker, Romano, and all their fellow officers worked for since TJ HOOKER obviously took place in Los Angeles just like CHiPs, ADAM-12, DRAGNET, etc.

Something else I found baffling about this police drama was I could never understand why Hooker and his fellow officers never wore a Summer uniform, unlike Ponch & Jon on CHiPs & unlike Malloy & McCord on ADAM-12 since Ponch, Jon, McCord, and Malloy along with all their fellow officers always wore their short-sleeved uniforms in the Spring & Summertime which was their Summer uniform, but always wore their long-sleeved uniform in the Fall and Wintertime which was their Winter uniform, but since Hooker & his fellow officers always wore their long-sleeved with a tie uniform only as if the LCPD had a no short-sleeve uniform policy or something, which was kind of odd for a police drama that took place here in Southern California, especially for the L.A. Area where it never even snows either.

It was also seeing guest stars like

By the way, something else intriguing that just occured to me is as luck would have it David Hasselhoff had auditioned for the role of Sgt. T.J. Hooker and had also auditioned for the short-lived STRIKE FORCE in the Winter of 1982, but got rejected from both, but then Hasselhoff eventually got hired for the role of Michael Knight by the Summer of 1982 before KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Autumn of 1982 not that David Hasselhoff wouldn't have made a great TJ Hooker.

Additionally, these first 2 seasons of TJ HOOKER take me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president and when I was living in the Imperial Valley growing up in my hometown(El Centro,CA).

In the meantime, I can hardly wait till TJ HOOKER's 1983-84 Season gets released on DVD, but I don't see what's taking Sony so long to get Hooker's 3rd Season released, especially since Sony hasn't released any more seasons of TJ HOOKER on DVD since the Summer of 2005, plus I just got word that even CHiPs-Season 3 is already in the works to be released on DVD in June of 2012 which I hope will motivate and prompt Sony to finally get TJ HOOKER's 3rd Season released, especially since Hooker's 3rd and 4th Seasons are even better than Hooker's first 2 seasons on top of that since that's when Corrigan becomes a permanent co-star on this show.

By the way, Warner Bros. will be releasing CHiPs 3rd Season out on DVD in March of 2015.",1258243200,5,12988,4.757225433526012

The episodes were always interesting, with a lot of twists and turns that keep you guessing.  I wish there were more TV shows like this today, but unfortunately there is not.

There are a LOT of scenes like that in this series, and it's downright FUN.

The acting can sometimes be WAY over the top and the plots are simple and sometimes full of holes, but that's JUST the way we like it! We ALL have guilty pleasures, and after watching (and enjoying) ""T.J. Hooker"" you'll probably feel very GUILTY.

Shatner is fantastic. The theme song is GREAT. The Nostalgia factor is HIGH!

2317455,4,B0009S4IHO,"William Shatner has had a very long and successful acting career in movies and television. Just when you think his career is over, he always seems to make a triumphant return in one way or another. T.J. Hooker was just that for Shatner, it resurrected his career in the 1980's and he hasn't stopped since. I've always felt that William Shatner had a sense of arrogance about him in the way he presented himself on screen, but somehow he always managed to make his characters like-able in the end.

T.J. Hooker is great 80's television and it's a treat to finally have this show on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want. This set contains the original pilot and all the remaining episodes from seasons 1 & 2 spread out over 6 single sided discs with slim case packaging. The picture and sound are well done and the show is still very entertaining even if it is a little dated. I hope that the remaining seasons are on the way and the Studio doesn't pull another stunt like they did with season one of S.W.A.T. The second and final season still hasn't been released. Nothing bothers me more than a studio not releasing season sets to complete a series of a show.

2317457,5,B0009S4IHO,"every saturday night my mother and i sat down to watch this show and i loved it then and i love it still.having just done star trek II, shatner stared in this pilot that got picked up and became his second hit show(i know star trek wasn't a hit at the time it aired but by this time it was a touch stone of the t.v. world)!

  a throw back to the 70's cop shows and dirty harry,t.j.(never found out what the t. j. stood for)hooker is a cop who turns down a gold shield to work the streets. when we first meet him he is coming back after being shot and getting into a shooting with ""bad guys""(or scum as he calls them) and is training new cops. in the first ""season""(5 shows and the pilot) hooker is bitter and a little of a drunk off duty. his partner is rookie adrian zemd, and together they wipe crime away like bug guts on the windsheild! after the first season it settled down into a standerd cop show and began a long run.

  to be fair, if you like shatner then you will love this show,if you don't like him,then don't get this set. i know shatner is a grade a sugarcured ham,but he still makes you watch him and really i think that is part of his charm and if you watch you can see even he winks at how hammy he is sometimes.

  as we have seen in the last few years with ""boston legal"" shatner (with two emmy wins ) there is more than ham in his blood!

  this is a great 80's flashback and will make you very happy to sit back and watch hooker bust the ""scum"" and keep us safe,till next week!",1148947200,2,1501,4.0
2317458,2,B0009S4IHO,"The show is awkwardly charming at times, but William Shatner's greedy need to be a superhero with all the lines and all the action scenes drags the show down. I'm surprised he didn't demand the ability to fly on the show. Everytime a bad guy needs to get caught, Shatner sends his underutilized partner Adrian Zmed to do some menial chore, so he can be the hero (EVERY SHOW!). If this weren't bad enough, all the stories are basically the same; very uncreative. The show opens with the bad guys doing something bad, then Shatner and Zmed chase and lose them, then Shatner's superhero police skills slowly but surely lead him to the bad guys, then he tells Zmed to call for back up while he singlehandedly jumps on buses, grabs onto helicopters, uses sharpshooting skills, ju-jitsu skills, and his holier-than-thou speeches to get the ""scumbags"" and ""maggots."" If Adrian Zmed is lucky, he gets an action seen where he gets to tackle someone, or he gets shot in the arm by the bad guy. The show is totally ridiculous, totally repetetive, and simply a vehicle to propel William Shatner to Clint Eastwood-like status. I love the 80s, and I thought this would be good (I have good memories of it)...but it's pretty bad. Watch the pilot (it's very good), maybe the first 6 or 7 episodes (they're decent) and then move on to Airwolf or something.",1145923200,10,1339,4.654008438818566

The characters are entertaining with William Shattner as the father figure T.J. Hooker, Adrian Zmed as Vincent Romano the big brother, and Heather Locklear as Stacey Sheridan the kid sister.

When this show came out in 82/83 I was too young to see it. I watched it over summer reruns years later with my sister. We both immediately fell in love with the dramatic stories which didn't take themselves too dramatically.

And just recently I purchased this boxset and have found it one of the best series for the price. I actually enjoy watching this show again. It's fantastic and not old, dated, and boring like other shows of that time. I've even gotten my roomate hooked on this show that he has never seen before. It's that entertaining.

Aaron Spelling is a television genius and with Hooker he shows us why.

The only small complaint that I have, and it is small but has to be acknowledged is the episode listings on the cases for each disc.  I just got finished with Disc 1 & 2.  Each case holds 2 discs and list the episodes on the discs, but it is inaccurate.  Disc 1 and Disc 2 show that there are 4-5 episodes on each of the discs and the case shows only 9 episode titles, but when you go into the DVD Episode Menu it shows a total of 11 or 12 episodes.  The sad thing is that you have to look to the case holding Disc 3 & 4 to get the episode listing for the unlisted episodes on the DVD case for Discs 1 & 2.  Assumably, I think the problem will be the same with the other cases and DVDs in the set.  A minor setback, but coming from Sony I am surprised this got past quality control...

2317465,5,B0009S4IHO,"To me this is one of the best cop shows I have ever seen.  The star is William Shatner as Sergeant Thomas John Hooker (you only hear his name in one episode which guest stars Vic Tayback so watch for it, it should be in THIS set) a former detective who decided (before the series started) to turn in his gold shield and put his uniform back on to train some raw academy recruits.  At the end of the 90 minute pilot, those who remain in the class get assigned veteran officers as partners and hit the streets.  One of these rookies (ironically the best in the class) Vince Romano (Adrian Zmed) lucks out and gets partnered with Hooker, and thus begins our series.  Throughout the 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1 and all of Season 2 (the first FULL season), stories revolve around Romano learning there is more to learn on the streets than what you learn in training, Hooker spending time with his family (ex wife Fran, a nurse, younguns Chrissy and Tommy and high school age Cathy, who works part time as a candy striper at the same hospital as her mom), Romano making goo goo eyes at the girl dispatcher (Vicki Taylor played by April Clough in the VERY SHORT first season or Stacy Sheridan (Heather Locklear) who happens to be the precinct Captain Dennis Sheridan (Richard Herd)'s daughter), Hooker training more rookies (with Romano as his aide), and more.  After the contents of this set (perhaps the Season 2 finale), Stacy graduates and gets partnered with another veteran Jim Corrigan (played by James Darren).  After a rocky start (ala the Adam 12 series premiere) Stacy and Jim become a partnership, and the remainder of the series (which will hit dvd soon I hope) they run tag team with Hooker and Romano.  Although, James Darren appears on the cover of this set, he does not become a regular til Season 3 (that's why you don't see his name on the box), by then also Captain Sheridan becomes occasional.  Watch in this set for an episode directed by Leonard Nimoy and another one co-starring Nimoy as a lieutenant friend of Hooker who goes off the beam when his daughter is raped.  This was a fixture on the Saturday night ABC lineup from 1982 to 1985 when it mysteriously got cancelled.  It then surfaced on CBS late night in mostly reruns, but a handful of new episodes (minus Adrian Zmed for reasons unknown) were produced.  The show stayed on CBS late night for another year, but by then was pretty much all reruns (from the original ABC run and their (CBS)'s run as well).  Hopefully Columbia will release all the other episodes soon (considering they've stalled on the second and final season of S.W.A.T. who knows).

It's very funny to watch if you don't take it seriously.  You can see Heather Locklear before she got famous. You can watch superior acting from the regulars like James Darren; who probably could have played the lead instead of Shatner.

William Shatner's career had been the doldrums for many years, but in '82 came both the huge cinematic success of THE WRATH OF KHAN and his return to television in this Aaron Spelling-produced police melodrama. It was a big deal, and for the first few years it was on the air, it remained one, at least in my household. Watching the first two seasons again on DVD -- after an interval of about 30 years -- reminds me why. Watching T.J. HOOKER is sort of like having a marching band stomp through your living room. It's big, it's gaudy, it's noisy, it has all the subtlety of a stripper with a machine gun, and after a little while you forget how cheesy it is and just enjoy the spectacle.

HOOKER is the story of T.J. Hooker (Shatner) a decorated detective for a fictional Los Angeles County based police department called the L.C.P.D., who, after the shooting death of his partner, decides to turn in his gold shield and return to life as a uniformed street patrol officer. At the same time, he's also a senior instructor at the Police Academy, and dealing with the aftermath of a divorce. He is assigned a cocky, happy-go-lucky young trainee named Vince Romano (Adrian Zmed) as a partner, and tries to educate ""Junior"" in the ways of the streets while fighting the department's bureaucracy, epitomized by oafish stickler Captain Dennis Sheridan (Richard Herd). Hooker is tough, fearless and a big believer that the best sort of police work is conducted with gun in one hand and nightstick in the other, and his throwback attitude -- very much part and parcel of the Reagan Era and its ""war on drugs"" -- is really the entire spirit of the show. Now, it should be noted that the first season of HOOKER is only five episodes, and that this basically constituted a gelling period tried to decide exactly what sort of series they wanted it to be. The pilot is called The Protectors, and that was originally to be the name of the series, whose focus was supposed to be on the embittered, hard-drinking Hooker and the group of young trainee cops under his command. It was quickly realized that Shatner was the real draw, and the show was renamed and retooled to focus on him, with only Zmed and Herd continuing in their roles. By the debut of the second season the formula was firmly in place, with the lovely Heather Locklear joining the cast as Stacey Sheridan, another trainee cop, and, at the end of the season, James Darren showing up as her future (from S3 onward) training officer and partner, Jim Corrigan.

HOOKER was an extremely formulaic show, and one quite at odds with its own concept. The whole raison d'etre of the character was that he'd willingly given up his detective's badge to return to street policing, yet in almost every episode, he acts as a detective, either because the detective are spread too thin right now, or because the case was personal to Hooker. In one scene, later parodied by THE SIMPSONS, Captain Sheridan tells Hooker he's off the case; Hooker barks, Wrong  I'm ON the case! and storms off. Even as a kid this insulted my intelligence, but you can't apply logic to a show like T.J. HOOKER. You just buckle up and enjoy the ride.

Most episodes followed a strict pattern. A crime would be committed, Hooker would be assigned (or assign himself) to the case, and following a predictable series of car chases, foot pursuits, fist fights and shootouts, culminating, of course, in the final shoot-out, where the criminal or criminals would either be captured (as was the case early in the series) or killed off (as was the case later). Because the formula was so repetitious, the real pleasure in the show rested entirely in watching Shatner growl insults at hapless hoodlums  maggot, scum and dirtbag were his favorites  and say things like, Resist arrest...resist arrest, PLEASE! as some drug dealer or hit man trembled in his sights. Also in the boyish hijinks of Vince Romano. Actually, the first two seasons of HOOKER more or lest hinge on the chemistry between the old veteran cop and the naive newcomer, and that's a good thing, because Shatner and Zmed have it in spades. Indeed, seasons one and two are probably the best of the series, because they focus so heavily on the two leads and their partnership. They also include many guest appearances, including Vic Tayback, Leonard Nimoy, Jim Brown and The Beach Boys, as well as a raft of character actors whose faces were as familiar to me as any stars', simply because they were on every damn TV program of the 70s and 80s.

Some of the more memorable episodes are ""The Protectors,"" ""God Bless the Child,"" ""The Witness,"" ""The Empty Gun,"" ""Terror at the Academy,"" ""The Survival Syndrome,"" ""A Cry For Help,"" ""Too Late For Love,""  ""The Decoy,"" and ""Vengeance is Mine,"" ""Raw Deal"" and ""Lady in Blue."" Also of note is the pulse-pounding, crash-bang score, composed and performed by Mark Snow, who went on to score THE X-FILES a decade later. But basically, this show is about watching cops put the blocks to cartoon bad guys with fists, batons and .357 Magnums. It has no subtlety, little realism and if I had a nickel for every time Hooker was hurled off a moving car and then got up and dusted himself off as if it were nothing, I'd be rich. And you know what? Who cares? This is 27 episodes of pure, mindless fun.",1517616000,,5480,4.619096509240246
