6447712,5,B00KU3Y4EK,Loved this series I found on Netflix and wanted to be able to watch it even if Netflix discontinues having it.  Thanks amazon so much for making it available!,1410998400,4,158,4.448275862068965
6447733,5,B00KU3Y4EK,Good series,1427673600,,11,5.0
6447734,3,B00KU3Y4EK,I didn't find season 2 as exciting as season 1 it became extremely comic book and lost character appeal still I'd give  a 3 star.,1426377600,2,129,4.16
6447735,2,B00KU3Y4EK,Season 2 missed the mark for me.  Really wish they had done better and kept Jones.,1426118400,3,82,4.125
6447736,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"I have to concur with the previous reviewer in that the 2nd season deteriorated rapidly after the first episode or two -- it began to feel more and more as if they were making it up as they went along.  I know, I know, it's based on a 'graphic novel', so I shouldn't expect too much -- but seriously?  The plot twists seemed as if they were tossed in just to be there.  The acting in season 2 wasn't up to the first season, either.  I can't recommend this at all.  One thing that put me off as well was the over-indulgence in martial arts sequences.  Oh well -- they gave me an opportunity to take a break.  Yawn.",1424736000,3,613,4.100840336134453
6447737,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"After watching first season all I can say, is what happen!?!? I can see why the second season was the death of this show! To bad!",1424736000,4,129,4.0
6447738,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"the 1st show was great,the 2nd show was really bad...lousy story line and the acting really really not up to the first year...seems the writers and producers are just not into keeping up the quality..sorry to say it was a bad investment",1423180800,6,236,4.642857142857143
6447739,5,B00KU3Y4EK,Very good series... one I hadn't saw before... reminds you of the 'Bourne' series... recommended watching....,1420588800,2,109,5.875
6447740,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"Too cartoonish improbable conspiracy backdoor. I just lost all interest. Harp and Tesla as a gambit and secret for MIC, seriously?",1419379200,3,130,5.238095238095238

6447742,3,B00KU3Y4EK,The story becomes too improbable and this season is a drop off from the first,1416700800,,77,4.2

8661598,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"Enjoyed the first season. The second season is horrible. The plots and characters are ridiculous.""Bagging"" an eagle does not get you elected President, it gets you thrown in prison.",1454371200,,181,5.275862068965517
8661599,4,B00KU3Y4EK,none,1440633600,,4,4.0
8661600,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"They changed characters from season 1 and the characters that stayed had different rolls and there was no bridge to let you know how they got there. Lastly the main character changed, he has a different personality, and different set of ethics - he is just a completely different roll then that of the main character in the first season.

I would recommend season one but that all.",1435968000,,381,4.602941176470588

8661603,1,B00KU3Y4EK,Loved the first Season. Second Season... I want my money back!!!! You won't watch past the first episode!!,1431388800,2,106,4.944444444444445
8661604,1,B00KU3Y4EK,"I rated this series in Netflix and I gave it a 3 star (originally), but then, I watched season 2, common, I rate it again, 1 star. The first season was OK, is no Jason Bourne, but ..., youll want more, at least I did. Some of the episodes were like what da anyway, season 1 will be a good thing to watch on a Sunday if you have nothing else to do.

Now, season 2, please, why did these guys make it? Its horrible, is like there was some budget left, and they say ""we need to use it, how?, a what the hell, lets do season 2, but wait, some things will not add up, the story, etc, ahhh what the hell, do it anyway, people won't notice.""

Well, I did, and believe me, after watching  2 or 3 episodes from season 2, youll regret loosing 3 or hours watching this crap.",1428192000,2,763,3.9415584415584415
8661605,3,B00KU3Y4EK,Season 1 of XIII was outstanding.  Season 2 was very disappointing.  Bizarre plots and strange characters in Season 2.,1428019200,3,118,5.157894736842105
