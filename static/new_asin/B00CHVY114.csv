8581894,4,B00CHVY114,"This anomalous Republic Pictures spectacular (resplendent in Trucolor) was made at the same time, and in parallel venues, as Max Ophuls' final film LOLA MONTES. That lyrical masterpiece shares with this lesser but interesting MAGIC FIRE a Bavarian studio and location background and several historical characters in common: Franz Liszt (a big role here for Carlos Thompson), Kings Ludwig I and II of Bavaria, and (by inference) Ludwig I's mistress the t&auml;nzerin Lola Montez, a role previously played (BLACK BART, 1948) by this picture's star Yvonne De Carlo. The grandson Ludwig II erected the fairytale Schloss Neuschwanstein and, no less importantly, became Richard Wagner's patron.

Here Yvonne plays Minna, a thankless role as Wagner's legal wife, and his mistresses/muses are Valentina Cortese (Mathilde) and Rita Gam (Cosima). Thus the original billing runs De Carlo, Thompson, Gam, Cortese and the marvelous Alan Badel fifth, as Wagner himself. In Austria and Germany the film was released more honestly as FRAUEN UM RICHARD WAGNER, since the thematic focus stays as much with the comely hoopskirted women as with the music or Badel/Wagner, the composer appearing doggedly in every scene.

General audiences in 1955 were not overwhelmed by the unknown (but really incisive) Badel, who resembles Basil Rathbone and, in the famous Rembrandt cap derided by Liszt, Wagner himself, nor did the glamour of De Carlo, Gam and Cortese make the film financially successful for the doomed yet ambitious Republic studio. Besides the pricey Continental shoot, Republic splurged in a big way with Dieterle as director, the legendary E.A. Dupont as a script collaborator and Erich Wolfgang Korngold as the music coordinator and soundtrack pianist. Korngold's virtuoso pianism (poorly mimed by both Thompson and Badel) is historically important and impressive, and it's fun to see him onscreen impersonating dirigent Hans Richter. The Korngold takes on Wagner's biggest hits were recorded with a Munich orchestra conducted by Alois Melichar, and the operatic voices include Leonie Rysanek, Hans Hopf and Otto Edelmann.

Casual viewers should check this out for Badel's performance as an alternative to the ponderous Richard Burton miniseries, and specialist collectors--while wishing for more music sequences and more Korngold--will find much to admire in Dieterle's direction, the fine location work (Ernest Haller was DP) and the soundstage glitz of De Carlo, Gam and Cortese. As a Republic biopic MAGIC FIRE is worth only three stars, but the project's creators and contributors are so distinguished and varied--and the inferential LOLA MONTES parallels so evident--that four stars seem well earned.",1467590400,,2697,5.509661835748792
8581895,5,B00CHVY114,The acting and costumes were fine.  The music was magnificent of course.  The actors playing Wagner and Liszt looked like men they portrayed.,1464739200,,141,5.086956521739131
8581896,5,B00CHVY114,"This is a biopic on the life of Richard Wagner, played admirably well by Alan Badel. It was made in 1955 by Republic Pictures. Herbert Yates was the studio chief then. It was directed by William Deieterle. For all Wagner enthusiasts, this is a fine film that makes good use of Wagner's music. The actual film music was arranged by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The film was processed in Trucolor as the other collaboration of Dieterle and Korngold, a Midsummer Night's Dream. Many details and accounts of the life of Richard Wagner were portrayed accurately and some of the accounts were stretched out for dramatic purposes. One of the highest points of this film is the accurate presentation of the riot among the elite at the Opera House in Paris during the Second Act of Tannhauser in its revised version with the Bacchanale and inclusion of ballet. Wagner did not heed to the advice of introducing the ballet in the second act as per the demands of the rich patrons; he kept it instead in the very beginning of the First Act, right after the fabulous overture. The film also correctly brings out the patronage of King Ludwig II in Wagner's life, without going too much into the intricate details of the controversial personality of that king. You will come across lavish sets, brilliant costumes and a large cast that includes the beautiful Yvonne De Carlo as Minna Planer, Wagner's First wife. Rita Gam plays Cosima, Liszt's daughter and Wagner's second wife while Carlos Thompson supports well as Franz Liszt. Valentina Cortese plays Mathilde Wesendonck. There are few scenes inducted in the film showing Weimar, where Liszt had settled down and composed much of his music. This is a prestigious film and serves as a great biographical document for Richard Wagner.",1435622400,,1765,4.886666666666667
