8320070,5,B001LX4BZU,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588
