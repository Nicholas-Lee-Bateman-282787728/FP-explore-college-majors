8388022,5,0793927595,"I really enjoyed watching this video. It is a great look back at who was considered to be the up and coming stars of the NBA at the time. Even though my favorite player on the video was Allen Iverson, my favorite Clip on the video was the beginning clip about Anfernee Penny Hardaway. I really liked the highlights they showed of him and his story (I actually have game 4 of the 1997 playoffs they talked about from the Miami Heat vs. Orlando Magic series where he scored 40). Penny was quite the player. And probably my second favorite part was on Juwan Howard and Chris Webber's journey from the Fab Five to the Pros. Buy this throwback video and watch it. I think you'll like it.",1303862400,,682,4.3359375
