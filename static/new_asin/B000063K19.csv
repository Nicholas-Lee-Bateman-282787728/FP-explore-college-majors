1690922,4,B000063K19,This DVD replaced a VHS of this movie in our library which finally wore out. The film depicts a real life message of ethnic tolerance that should be a lesson for everyone. We watch it about three or four times a year and never tire of it.,1334793600,2,238,4.085106382978723

1690925,4,B000063K19,"This is a heartwarming (albeit slow-paced) movie about an aging and crabby Jewish deli owner, Abel Shaddick (Peter Falk), who lives in Fairview, N.Y. It is 1969, and Abel's delicatessen is slowly being run into the ground. Abel just can't summon much enthusiasm for life - he's a long-time widower, and his only son was killed in WW II at 19. Broken-hearted and lonely Abel spends his days berating his (very few) customers, and nagging his good-for-nothing Lothario nephew Stanley (Andrew McCarthy in a small role). Things change when Stanley on a spontaneous whim, sponsors a young African-American boy from Harlem to come down and stay with him for two weeks. Predictably enough, he doesn't live up to his commitment, and abandons the young boy. Herman (played by Aaron Meeks) makes his way to Abel's deli, and initially the two can't abide each other, but soon enough a unique bond forms between the two, forged in part through their mutual loneliness and shared pain.

The story moves at a very leisurely pace, but it really is a heartfelt drama. Natassja Kinski plays a young woman of means who runs the program Herman is in, and though her role is minor, she does bring grace and beauty to her role. The highlight here is Peter Falk's portrayal of the lonely old Jewish man, and his brand of sarcasm and Jewish humor is fun to watch, as is his interactions with Herman. Worth watching for Peter Falk's performance, who delivers some funny lines, such as "" Herman, our enemies are multiplying. In the nighttime it is the Hell's Angels, and in the daytime, it's society matrons!""",1264377600,3,1584,4.781021897810219
1690926,4,B000063K19,"By a fool-play of a fate, in the USA-1969 seventy year old Jew-shop-owner is accidentally made hosting a nine-year old Afro-American boy visiting this place as a summer exchange charity program participant.

Their relations and bond present a significant picture of then American civic affairs and testify to a long way an American society made since Vietnam era to nowadays.

Very nice performing and generally funny stuff.",1232582400,,424,5.313432835820896

1690966,5,B000063K19,"I found this to be an extremely wonderful DVD.  Peter Falk is already one of my favourite actors ... and he plays his part so well in this touching movie.
This young boy is sent from the tough life of inner-city, to spend the summer with Peter Falk's son (in the movie).  However, his son has no sense of -- responsibility, nor committment ... and he is gone before the boy even arrives.  One thing leads to the next, and Peter Falk decides to take on the challenge of looking after him and caring for him.  At first, they do NOT get along, always at complete odds with each other.  But as the story unfolds, you begin to see a bond starting up between them.  Tragedy strikes in the family of the young boy, and he is more than devastated by it.
With Peter Falk's disappointment with his own son, and trying to open up a trusting bond with this young lad visiting ... the story is sincerely felt and  appreciated.
It's a story of -- accepting people ""in spite of"" our differences; learning to trust one another; overcoming with forgiveness (knowing that none of us are perfect); realizing that a true friendship can occur between the immaturity of a beligerant youth and the maturity of a embittered senior; and, opening up to love, once again.
I was moved by this heart-warming story, and strongly recommend it.",1372118400,7,1312,4.510548523206751

1690968,3,B000063K19,"The friendship between a black kid and an elderly poor Jew makes for a good, moving story; but the story drags at times, and the segment set in the country club is very heavy-handed and preachy. I give it credit for taking up a demanding theme but the magnetism is not quite there as far as i am concerned, not quite.",1335830400,,317,4.213114754098361
