5629053,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I bought this DVD because I enjoyed Jenni Rawlings' previous video so much. This is a very challenging, beautifully choreographed vinyasa workout with the best cueing I've ever found on a yoga video. The tutorials for the advanced moves are a wonderful addition. I hope Jenni continues to put out more yoga videos, since I live way to far from her studio to take a class in person!",1376438400,4,381,4.617647058823529
5629054,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I'm writing this from my viewpoint of being a yoga teacher myself, and from having taken class with Jenni in person. I love her class so much that I decided to keep this DVD at home for times when I can't make it to sweat and rock out at the studio with her and her stalwart group of regular students. A happy, happy bunch, they are. Her classes have built my strength and overall energy more than that of any other teacher I've studied with - and that's a lot of teachers, over 15+ years of practicing yoga.

This video is a must-have for anyone interested in deepening and stretching their flow practice. As the back cover says: be prepared to sweat! Jenni has a strong background in Ashtanga, and really GETS the nuts and bolts of the postures. The tutorials on the difficult poses are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.

Jenni is a genius at sequencing. I love how creative she is with the sequences, and with five routines of varying lengths (so that you can find one to fit whatever time slot you have available), this DVD never gets old. I like that Jenni is depicted doing the sequences with a voiceover in the background. Her voice is calming and steady and the explanation/leadership is clear as a bell throughout. The variations in setting are nice too: beach, forest, and a beautiful ochre-walled studio.

This one's a must-have. Did I mention that? Namaste, y'all, and THANKS, Jenni!",1374537600,64,1403,4.559523809523809
5629055,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I really like this DVD! As someone who's been doing vinyasa yoga for a couple of years, I find the sequences challenging but manageable. I also think that someone who's been doing yoga for less time but is generally fit would be able to do the routines on this with no problems and really enjoy them. The instructor has a great, calm voice and a very genuine presence, which I appreciated--you never feel like she's showing off or being intrusive or insincere. While the practices are strong and challenging, with a high level of flow, they have interesting, creative sequencing that feels very natural. There's an interesting mix of powerful practice/soothing tone, so you get an intense workout but while listening to gentle music and looking at a serene background. Also (and this is very important for me), I never feel unsafe when I do one of these routines--I have sometimes found with other yoga DVDs that the instructors say to do things that, for me, at least, feel risky to the back and neck.

A couple of the workouts have longer and shorter versions of the same workout. I've only done the longer versions, but like that the shorter ones exist for people who are pressed for time. Also, when the instructor introduces a variation, the screen shows a shot of that variation in the upper corner, so you can see both possibilities at once.",1370476800,45,1348,4.711864406779661
5629115,5,B00BJ3AR78,"This is exactly what I've been looking for! A fast-paced, challenging vinyasa flow that makes you sweat, but still focused and steady enough that it gives you that ""yoga high"" feeling afterwards. Jenni's instructions are very clear and easy to follow. She gives you tips and modifications. She also says each pose name in both English and Sanskrit. Very cool. I love that it gives you multiple options for different practices, and different lengths (30 min, 40 min, 45 min, 1 hour) so there's an option for you no matter how much time you have. This has helped me take my practice to the next level. Love it. The only negative thing I could say is that the background music is kind of weird, but it doesn't take away from all of the positives previously mentioned. This is quickly becoming my favorite yoga DVD in my collection.",1496880000,2,828,4.639455782312925
5629116,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I really appreciate the pace (although too fast for some people), I love how the more difficult poses are broken down is a separate segment of the DVD, this dvd is just fantastic. You'll achieve a great & sweaty practice.",1496016000,,221,4.55
5629117,5,B00BJ3AR78,"This yoga is not for beginners, it is for intermediate and advance practitioners. I liked very much it has totally 5 workout videos, two 1 hours, one 45 minutes, one 40 minutes and one 30 minutes workout. Also have one 30 minutes pose guide. I feel good product for the money. The yoga is medium speed which is good  and I liked it, but challenging.",1492992000,,349,4.369230769230769
5629118,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Great way to start branching out into more ""advanced"" yoga from the beginner stage. Jenni is very clear and easy to follow in the videos and very encouraging. Definitely worth trying if you want to learn new poses and challenge yourself, but still be in the realm of possibility for a newer yogi.",1492646400,,296,4.60377358490566
5629119,5,B00BJ3AR78,"At first I was intimidated by some of the difficult poses, but it turns out I was able to do most of the poses/vinyasas. I am intermediate level, doing at home  workouts. What she can do is amazing, but her teaching style is calm, instructive and non-judgmental. I do this workout 2x weekly in addition to barre, Pilates and ballet workouts. I recommend this workout.",1490313600,2,367,4.6461538461538465
5629120,5,B00BJ3AR78,GREAT VIDEO.  GOOD WORKOUT.,1488067200,,27,5.75
5629121,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Great video. She talks just enough to explain what's happening and says the next pose or flow just before it happens so you can keep up. Not an easy video, definitely for those with a knowledge of flow yoga.",1484438400,,207,4.333333333333333
5629122,4,B00BJ3AR78,"This video is not simply advanced: it is gratuitiously advanced. One moment you're working through an ordinary Vinyasa, the next you're balanced on one hand with your other three limbs contorted into a pretzel. The pace is also quite hard to follow and gets confusing at times.

Edit: I'm raising this review from 3 to 4 stars, after a few more sessions. The video has three different sections, beach, forest and studio, the first two have two versions, long and short. If I stick to the short version and just hold a simple pose when she decides to perform acrobatics, I find this is a good workout, great for core building and a little sweaty too.",1481500800,8,649,4.594827586206897
5629123,1,B00BJ3AR78,Suppose to have a pose guide  with the DVD.  But there was  none.  Not to happy.  Tks.  Would like to return!,1480723200,2,109,3.9523809523809526
5629124,5,B00BJ3AR78,Good yoga DVD I'm not at a level where I can really keep up this is def for more advanced yogis but I can't wait until I get further along in my practice and able to use this dvd,1480636800,,178,3.58974358974359

5629136,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Absolutely great workout! It's a little tough, so you should have adequate yoga experience. Even broke a pretty good sweat. Love the scenery and vinyasas!",1471564800,3,154,5.2
5629137,5,B00BJ3AR78,It is definitely intermediate/advanced yoga workou DVD. I still cannot do most of the handstands so I modify them. It has 5 routines with different lengths. A keeper for anyone in yoga who wants to move to next step.,1470614400,,216,4.564102564102564
5629138,4,B00BJ3AR78,"This is a good quality yoga video, but I should have purchased a beginner video first.  I have been a yoga class at my gym for about 6 months and decided I was ready for a home video for when I can't make class. This was too advanced for me.  I will eventually graduate to these yoga sequences...I hope.",1469318400,2,303,4.11864406779661
5629139,5,B00BJ3AR78,This is the third yoga tape I've tried and it's the best one! Highly recommend!,1468022400,,79,4.333333333333333
5629140,5,B00BJ3AR78,This is my second video by jenni Rawlings.  I love how her workouts are so intense!  This is definitely a video for those who have been practicing yoga for awhile.  There is a 30 minute segment that goes through the poses if you need a quick review.  I think the 30 minute studio workout is the most challenging one on this disc!  It is very fast paced!  Most of the moves from the two 60 minute workouts are squeezed into this shorter one-but she moves through the poses very quickly and I was sweating within minutes!,1467072000,,519,4.354166666666667
5629141,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I did Rondey Yee's Power Yoga series for the last year and it was getting too easy (plus the line/personal joke where he says, ""bend you knees, grab your ankles..."" then me laughing and saying, ""and kiss your ass goodbye"" was wearing thin). I needed to step it up. Jenni Rawlings is awesome! I've been following along with this dvd and found I am able to keep up with the beach routine (just when my body wants to stop in the hour long routine, we start floor stretches - perfect timing!). I tried the woods routine but am not quite ready for it yet, which is really nice - I know this dvd will last me a while! The posing guide is wonderful too. It's like I'm in a private class with Jenni. Jenni has a voice and speaking rhythm that's calm, easy to follow and down to earth. I love that she's not a cable tv, overly buff, barbie doll that speaks like she's trying to sell you the idea of doing yoga. Jenni is more like your laid back yoga friend with a wealth of wisdom to share that furthers a person's yoga in body and mind.",1466985600,5,1028,4.1708542713567835
5629142,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I love this DVD! There are 5 practices and a yoga pose guide (which I have not used). There are two 1 hour practices and shorter versions of each of those (40 and 45 minutes) as well as a 30 minute practice that is really tough. I mainly do the 40 and 45 practices, which are both very challenging. There are many sun salutations in each and the pace is brisk. Also, while many practices end with seated poses, the shorter practices on this DVD really don't -- you are standing most of the time. There is a bit more sitting in the beach practice, but I work up a sweat each time I use this DVD. It is a great addition to my yoga DVD collection.",1465257600,4,644,4.078740157480315
5629143,5,B00BJ3AR78,Perfect!,1464048000,,8,8.0
5629144,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Wow! This is an excellent set of practices by an excellent teacher. I have 10-15 yoga DVDs; if you name the teacher, I likely have at least one of his/her yoga DVDs. This one, however, is my absolute favorite. I love the challenge of these practices, and Jenni is a great teacher, guiding you through the flows. I find her style very relatable, unlike some other yoga teachers who themselves a bit too seriously.

I would classify these practices as advanced intermediate. That is, you don't have to do head/handstands to roll through these flows, but you do have to know and master proper alignment of basic and intermediate balance poses (and some more advanced poses, such as crow). For a more approachable vinyasa flow practice, try Colleen Saidman's Yoga for Weight Loss or Calorie Killer DVDs, as well as Kathryn Budig's Aim True DVD.",1460073600,7,840,4.793103448275862
5629155,5,B00BJ3AR78,I am in transition from beginner to intermediate and this DVD will take me to advance. Plenty to do for an intermediate level and lots to advance to. This woman is STRONG.,1457913600,,171,4.375
5629156,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Wow-what a great find.  Numerous workouts, Challenging for sure!!!  But the instructions are so clear and concise, the next thing you are doing a
pose you didn't think you could.  I especially am thankful for the individual pose instructions at the end.  I pick one and work specifically on that one (with Jenni's instructions), until I get it.  So Happy to have this DVD.  Highly recommended.",1457827200,8,393,4.878787878787879
5629157,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Definitely an advanced workout.

The setting is nice.  But most of all, it's a thorough, challenging, packed yoga practice that will advance your skills and leave you feeling energized, strong, and stretched.  Yes, a home yoga practice that includes arm balances and hand stands!  If I could only own one yoga DVD, it would be this one.  I've been recommending it to everyone.",1454976000,10,511,4.9411764705882355
5629161,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I love yoga and done it for years and I absolutely love Jenni Rawlings DVDs.  I bought this after having another DVD of hers for a few months.  Sometimes I don't have time to do a full yoga workout.  She offers a variety of different length workouts while keeping the quality of the shorter ones.  She offers two one hour long work outs, a 45 minute work out and a 30 minute one.  Her shorter ones pack a lot of punch and I always feel like I got a lot out of it, so I don't feel gypped from having to shorten my work out.  Probably going to stick with her for awhile.",1454371200,5,568,3.982300884955752
5629162,4,B00BJ3AR78,"I really am liking this DVD but it is definitely not going to be easy for someone that is new to yoga. The pace can be fast at times and if you aren't familiar with moving through the poses it would be hard. You really need to know what each pose is by name since it is sometimes difficult to see what she is doing and move into the pose at the same time. I think this would be the case with any yoga video since yoga is different than other work out videos.

I have been practicing yoga in a studio consistently for the last year and find it a good work out when I can't get to the studio. I like the option for 30, 40, 45, and 60 minute sessions. I also appreciate the variations to make each pose more difficult or easier.",1453852800,6,725,3.9657534246575343

Even though the work out is challenging her style and demeanor is laid back, she does not make you feel incompetent if you are not quite ready to perform the difficult poses.

5629252,5,B00BJ3AR78,"The part of the Jenni Rawlings yoga sets that I think says the most about her as an instructor.
Is one of the Shivasana where she gives brief physical instructions on relaxing the arms and legs, and then says in her calm, easy-going way.
""It's Your Shivasana."" and then the music starts and she says nothing else.

Jenni Rawlings practice is challenging. But I have been able to do THREE moves that I never thought I'd be able to do.
Today, I successfully and easily did a move I have been working at for FIVE years. WOW, that was fun !

There are some challenging moves but for someone who has been doing yoga for awhile the modification or easy to find.
Jenni has an easy-going, non-intrusive style that lets the students have their own practice.

Her voice is soothing and clear, which is really important to me.  I started doing Vinyasa/Power at my gym a few months ago, and with winter approaching, I wanted a video to do at home.  Generally, I am a tough critic because I really do not like doing a DVD yoga practice - I love my instructor and being with others when I practice.  I was nervous that this DVD would be too difficult, but I have progressed enough in my practice to feel challenged but not overwhelmed - and I love that Jenni gives you choices to advance your practice to the next level if you feel ready (I cannot do any arm balances yet.)

Every day I work harder towards achieving each pose. Just make sure to learn the poses before starting--and maybe modify some of the stretches at first to avoid pulled muscles. Get a yoga towel for the wrap around poses, or you'll be pulling the muscles between your ribs if you're a beginner!",1422403200,,424,4.743243243243243

5629281,5,B00BJ3AR78,"So far so good!  I have been practicing yoga on and off for about 15 years.  I do not consider myself advanced when it comes to inversions or certain arm balances, but my endurance for prolonged holds and many sun saluations/vinyasas is pretty good.  With that said, while some 'power yoga' dvds tend to be less of a workout for me than I'd like, other Ashtanga dvds can sometimes be too fast paced.  I completed the 1 hour forest practice yesterday and found it to be absolutely perfect. Just the right mix of poses and pace I am used to, along with a few challenging poses which I need to work on in order to become comfortable.  In addition to the practice I did, there is one other 1 hour practice along with a 40 and 30 minute, all of which I am excited to try. The flow was fast enough to be challenging, and modifications were always offered for headstands, etc. There is also a WONDERFUL 30 minute tutorial which covers 7 of the more difficult poses from start to finish, offering a couple different camera angles for reference.  Overall,  I am happy to find a dvd that is challenging for me, yet offers some room for modification and/or improvement depending on how I feel that day.",1421193600,4,1191,4.435779816513762

It's natural and challenges you, but there are no pretensions and it's easy to find a modifier.  This is one of the first yoga videos I've ever tried and I can't find another that I like as much.",1419206400,5,283,4.017857142857143
5629298,5,B00BJ3AR78,"Great for yogi's with an established practice. I would consider myself at an ""intermediate"" level - at least as far as it comes to yoga asanas and it's hard to find a DVD that I feel is challenging enough but not overwhelming. There's lots of opportunity for practicing hand stands and other arm balances in this video, which is good. I personally prefer the forest practice to the beach and I think it's a little more challenging. I got a great work out in the 1 hour practices. When I was strapped for time, I did the 30 minute practice and still got a good work out. I like that this video gives you options like that and there's enough variety to not get bored too quickly. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone from advancing beginner to early advanced. For the more advanced you can always modify throughout the practice. For instance, I go into revolved bird of paradise when she offers up either a twisting bind or side crow. And there's lots of opportunity to ""up level"" throughout the video.  So I think even an advanced practitioner would find value in this DVD.",1418860800,13,1083,4.525510204081633

I was so proud that the last time I did it I was able to do it for a second....literally.  You definitely need to know the poses as she is flying but you also need to have endurance and strength.  I tried it when I first got it and there was no way I could do it.

Jenni, is an excellent instructor and the flow of each move is perfectly paced. It's nice to finally find an advanced yoga workout, that truly is advanced.

I mainly use this as either a morning workout, or during my recovery period from other workouts/programs (e.g. Ruthless, S90, Insanity).",1410825600,2,398,4.838235294117647
5629359,5,B00BJ3AR78,"This is a great workout. It is difficult at times(arm balances, inversions) but overall a very good , pretty fast paced workout. Lots of vinyasses ,which I happen to like. What I really liked about it is that there are many workouts and they are not all the same . There is variety so if you choose to do a 45 min. version of an hour workout, it is different enough to not be repetitive. Jenni's voice is soothing . Her half hour on how to get into the difficult balances and inversions is great for when I feel confident enough to try them. I think she put a lot of thought into these workouts and it is a great addition to my yoga collection!",1410048000,5,644,4.16

This is an intermediate to advanced DVD routine but beginners will enjoy the challenge and goal to strive for in yoga practice. Love the 3 scenes.

5629385,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I don't have any other dvd's with Jenni Rawlings so wasn't sure what to expect.  When you 1st start watching it, you see she's not your typical DVD yoga instructor.  She looks like the girl next door.  There are several options with different backgrounds - beach or forest.  Don't be fooled by the easy, gentle warm-ups.  This girl is good!  Her handstands & floor balances look easy when she does them, but I'm definitely a work-in-progress!!!  I thought I was a fairly decent yogi & I'm sure I'd be considered ""intermediate"".  There is no pressure to do these tough poses, but it's now a goal of mine.  Love this DVD!!!!",1395619200,4,622,4.581818181818182
5629386,5,B00BJ3AR78,I am an intermediate yogini and absolutely love this dvd.  Jenni rawlings is clear and explains everything well.  They are all great workouts and I sweat every time.  I highly recommend.,1394928000,3,186,4.935483870967742
5629387,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I liked the sound of this one from reviews and the clips of Jenni that I viewed online. The routines are short and long versions ""by the ocean"" and ""in the forest"" of 40 mins and 1 hr (so 4 routines) and then a 30 min studio practice. Like others have said, Jenni has come up with some great transitions, so that even in places where you move quickly it's not that difficult.

If you are intermediate and up you should enjoy this one, and she does offer some options if you're not advanced. Both the pose guide and the practices allow you to progress more quickly I feel than with other routines I've tried. The transition from one legged down dog to ""wild thing"" seemed quite simple the way she cues it for e.g.

I can't as yet do arm balances apart from crow so it's something to work towards (side crow and that scissor thing) and I like the challenge of that, but she doesn't make you feel like you should do anything other than what your body is ready for. In fact she stresses in various places that you should see how something feels first. Some days are easier than others!

Really good cuing, and for me, a nice relaxed approach. The routines themselves are challenging but done in a relaxed manner which sounds counter-intuitive, but somehow she pulls it off.

I expected the studio practice to be a bit easier than the others with less focus, but I was quite wrong. It is the most fast-paced of the routines (and may be a little fast for some) and she packs a lot in, but she slows down after a bit and allows little rests here and there to cleverly keep you going without stopping. Really loved the sequencing of that one. Lots of vinyasas and forward bend transitions to chair which my spine benefits from. So great to have a shorter but power-packed routine for busy days.

Overall, this one is going to get used a lot as it's my favourite style of well-cued, progressive, relaxed but challenging vinyasa yoga with the bonus of being filmed outdoors. If you like Eoin Finn's routines as I do, you may well like this too.....

Great job Jenni, and I hope you do more DVDs like this one...!!",1391126400,28,2103,4.39331619537275
5629388,5,B00BJ3AR78,"I love this DVD. There is no showmanship or fanciness, just a good, complete vinyasa workout (actually 5 of them of varying lengths). Jenni has a pleasing voice and there is no ego involved in her practices. Highly recommended for intermediate+ yogis.",1390435200,5,251,5.0
5629389,4,B00BJ3AR78,"I have a daily/regular practice in vinyasa and rocket yoga. I needed a DVD to use while traveling that could help keep me from regressing in my practice. I really like Jenni's style; she is far more similar to the yoga teachers I practice with in DC than DVDs like Rodney Yee or Shiva Ray. The only thing preventing me from giving five stars was that I was hoping for a bit more rigor from a DVD labeled as ""advanced"", but this is the case with every single yoga DVD I've found so far. It was a solid practice and I definitely enjoyed it!",1388707200,2,538,4.1826923076923075

I held off getting this DVD because I was scared off by the word ""advanced"", and was pleasantly surprised about how easy it was to modify just about any pose I couldn't get into.  Jenni's approach is very low-pressure, and to do what feels right.  The outdoors settings are beautiful.  My only suggestion would be to make it where there isn't a time where the person at home is set up to be facing away from the screen when a new pose is being shown.

I've been doing this workout for 3 months and my strength has improved dramatically. I am a finance career and business development coach and I encourage my clients to be healthy, workout, and eat well, which is why I recommend this yoga dvd. Besides these factors, here are 5 more reasons I love this video.
1. Great music - the music is perfect to get in the frame of mind and have a serene, yet powerful workout.
2. Naming the poses - I love knowing the names of the poses in Hindi. This adds a quality of authenticity to the practice.
3. Excellent narration - Jenni keeps you moving with excellent narration. For the first month I had to hear and watch. Now I can just listen.
4. Spirituality - I feel calm and centered even after completing a challenging workout.
5. 5 different workouts - there are a variety of workouts depending upon the time you have available and the setting you would like to see. There's a 30 minute for when I am rushed and just want to get in a video in a fast-paced day. There are 40 minute and a 45 minute videos when you are short of time but need more.
