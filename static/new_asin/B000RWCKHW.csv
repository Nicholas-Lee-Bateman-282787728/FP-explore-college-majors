2875847,5,B000RWCKHW,"Kent Brown rightfully wears the mantel of Civil War historian William Townsend. Just as Townsend helped redefine our knowledge base of Abraham Lincoln (""Lincoln and his Wife's Hometown""), Brown details a mostly overlooked and fascinating episode in the early Rebel struggle: To control the strategically important state of Kentucky. The side that controls Kentucky controls the Ohio and upper Mississippi rivers. Long story short, the narrative includes the longest military movement by rail in world history. The failure of the Confederacy to control Kentucky (even though it won a tactical victory at Perryville) was the first domino to fall in the inevitable collapse of the Southern Cause in the Western Theatre. And Kent brings it alive with detailed maps, description of the military leaders on both sides, and intricately interwoven live action from contemporary reenactments. Make this a part of your Sesquicentennial experience -- and look for Kent's books that unveil other less-known topics, such as ""Retreat from Gettysburg.""",1373587200,6,1037,5.528301886792453
2875848,5,B000RWCKHW,"Get out the note pad! A heap of information comes at you fast and furious!
High end production values, great graphics and detailed explanations make this video one of the best in my library.

A must have!",1255046400,5,204,4.513513513513513
2875849,5,B000RWCKHW,"Very interesting and well done film about the Civil War in Kentucky............lots of detail to the point that you cannot absorb all of it.  but even with that said, this is just extremely good description of the pivotal role played by Kentucky in the Civil War and the terrific effort made by both sides to claim it as their own.  President Lincoln is famously quoted as saying it would be nice to achieve some marvelous thing  but ""I must  have Kentucky.""  And he got it..........Plan to watch it again!!",1447891200,,507,4.651685393258427

2875863,5,B000RWCKHW,"Detailed, precise, and well-organized.  This is an enlightening study of a complex and little known aspect of the Civil War which nonetheless had great impact on its outcome.  Well-supported with illustrations and maps, it is well worth attention by Civil War and other history buffs.",1425945600,,284,5.288888888888889
2875864,5,B000RWCKHW,"This is an overlooked theater of the Civil War.  It has clear historic import, and this presentation if unique in its viewpoint, educational yet entertaining.",1420156800,,158,5.32

2875872,3,B000RWCKHW,So little is written about the civil war battles fought in Kentucky.  This film was both welcome and enlightening.  I hope someday to visit the sites of these battlefields.,1402444800,,172,4.896551724137931
2875873,3,B000RWCKHW,"In 1862 two Confederate armies, one under Generals Braxton Bragg and another under Kirby Smith, launched an invasion of Kentucky, a slave-holding state but one that had been kept in the Union by timely federal action. This invasion would ultimately fail to rally the population to the Confederate cause (even though a Confederate governor was sworn in at the occupied capital of Frankfort) and the rebels would withdraw after losing the Battle of Perryville.

My own Civil War ancestor enlisted in the 14th Kentucky Cavalry at this time. Not only did the rebels fail to enlist new Kentucky regiments for the Confederate Army but many Kentuckians saw the invasion for what it was and wanted to get rid of the invaders.

This video was done with good narration, using some computer animation, footage of re-enactors doing their thing and period photos. However, the footage of re-enactors marching with snow digitally added couldn't possibly fool anyone. Also, at least one photo used to illustrate the fight at Perryville was actually shot at Gettysburg. Still, a good effort regarding a little-remembered chapter of the Civil War.",1400889600,,1130,5.135869565217392
2875874,5,B000RWCKHW,"A very well done depiction with still inserts, maps, and cartography of the notable field commanders on both sides with good narratives explaining each campaign and troop movements accompanying each action.  For a novice it cleared up a plethora of questions about the little known episode in determining Kentucky's neutrality during the Civil War.  All through High School in OH this important era and battles fought in KY were not detailed in any of my history or geography courses.  I doubt that many people other than those who attend the various War Colleges, Military Institutes or Training Academies are familiar with this history and really have to thank the people who assembled it for our edification.",1394668800,2,711,5.112068965517241
2875875,4,B000RWCKHW,"If you are interested in the invasion by Confederate Troops of Kentucky in 1862 and the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky (Oct. 8, 1862) the DVD is very informative and well done.",1393545600,,176,4.709677419354839
2875876,3,B000RWCKHW,This production was historically correct but exceedingly tedious to watch.  I would not recommend viewing this movie unless you are a history buff.,1393545600,,147,5.391304347826087
2875877,5,B000RWCKHW,"90 years after these events, I was born in one of the towns mentioned in this piece, very near a ""Buckner"" Lane (watch the video and you'll see the reference). I grew up on stories of the Civil War and this documentary is a gold-mine of information not found elsewhere. It's separately interesting for its tying-in the strategy and links with the battles for the river forts, and Shiloh, Nashville, Chattanooga etc. The depth of info, the graphics, the on-site video all make this much more interesting than the ""usual"" gloss-over by Smithsonian etc.  A must-see by anyone who loves history.",1389571200,,591,4.851485148514851
2875878,3,B000RWCKHW,"Pretty good presentation of a small part of the war.  The lecturer was a little bit long winded, in my opinion.",1386201600,,111,4.285714285714286
