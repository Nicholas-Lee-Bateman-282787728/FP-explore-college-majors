8108631,5,B000EDWLWI,"This 1987 drama crime thriller is forgotten gem. It's not perfect but it has a good story and directed for well like a classic film noir from the 40's.
Joe Don Baker who was passed his leading man status makes a middle age Sheriff of this sleep small east coast town who's about to retire
come to life with a murder case involving his deputy played by the son of Lloyd Bridges Beau Bridges who I never found a very good actor
like his father. He's just bland and boring seems to walk thru every role including this one. Kiefer Sutherland son of Donald is also here in
probably one of his earlier roles and plays a psycho killer who takes the identity of a deputy after killing him. I won't give away the ending.
He's actually good in his role even though not a big fan of him. The movie's best role is Wayne Rogers who plays the big Trump type who
wants to build a big development in the area against the town's wishes. His murder becomes Baker's reason to stay in the town. The ending
is somewhat disappointing but overall it's one of the better 80's crime dramas from that era which there were many. Killing Time Good Time.",1471132800,,1125,4.311320754716981

8108633,3,B000EDWLWI,"I bought this for Kiefer Sutherland. I was a little disappointed that he was only in half the movie. But his character def was interesting. And the other scenes weren't bad, either. I'd recommend you watch at-least once. Not a favorite of mine but it was still good for what it was.",1423267200,,282,4.4423076923076925

8108636,1,B000EDWLWI,"I read the reviews, I saw the warnings, even the plot summary was a pretty good indicator that this movie would be nothing but bad but I still watched it. My biggest problem with watching a bad movie, is watching a bad movie that could have been good but the writing and/or casting ruined it. This is one of them. I only watched this movie cause Kiefer Sutherland is in it but he is just a terrible fit for the character. I think he was to young to grasp a character like that, or maybe he missed the mark on purpose... Either way this movie missed the mark. There are so many things that didn't make sence or choices that could have been changed that would have made the movie worth watching.

I do not recomend this movie unless you are a Kiefer completist, and even then i'd say don't waste your time.",1272931200,2,804,4.254901960784314

8108638,3,B000EDWLWI,"Made in 1987, The Killing Time is the kind of unambitious, low-budget crime thriller that Roger Corman would have produced in the 50s. It stars B-movie veterans Beau Bridges and Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall), plus then newcomers Kiefer Sutherland and Michael Madsen (Resevoir Dogs). The story is basically a Double Indemnity retread set in sleepytown California. The story has some implausible parts and they could have thought the story out a bit better, but I enjoyed seeing a lot of good actors work together in this one, and I liked that the movie ended with a fistfight over a pistol on a rural California beach. Also, I liked that the Kiefer Sutherland's character has no name and his past and his motives remain unexplained at the end of the film.

I realize this film was not well received by critics when it came out, but I think fans of these actors and fans of The Fast and the Furious (1954) will enjoy it. The DVD has no extras.",1209945600,4,940,4.562130177514793
8108639,1,B000EDWLWI,"Without a doubt  Kiefer Sutherland's  worst role of all time  was in 1987's The Killing Time.  The movie itself almost derailed Sutherland's career.

Kiefer Sutherland stars as a hitchhiker who kills Brian Mars who has just been hired as a deputy sheriff in a coastal county in Louisiana. Sutherland assumes the identity of his victim and arrives in the county seat to become a new deputy sheriff and nobody suspects otherwise. And this despite the fact that Mars was supposed to be a very good friend of the chief deputy sheriff (Beau Bridges) and also despite Sutherland's tendency to make psycho-type statements such as saying that he likes being a deputy sheriff because he can carry a gun and shove people around.

Perhaps part of the reason why nobody catches on to Sutherland's deception is that in this particular county, incompetence in law enforcement is rampant. The county sheriff, played by Joe Don Baker, is a a good old boy to a comical degree.  Even by the low standards of Hollywood, Baker's  exaggerated Southern fried sheriff behavior is absurd. If The Killing Time was a comedy, then it might work. However, in an alleged straight action drama, Baker's act is screwy.

The chief deputy sheriff is not much better. Despite the fact that his ex-girlfriend is now married to a wealthy San Francisco real estate developer who has a nice estate down in the Louisiana county, he keeps on messing around with her to the point of going to San Francisco to attend parties that both she and her husband attend. This on a salary that Bridges's character says is a bit short of $20,000. The husband (Wayne Rogers, formerly Trapper John on M*A*S*H*) is understandably concerned about the fact that this Louisiana lawman keeps on hanging around his wife, especially since the wife clearly likes Bridges's attention.

As it happens, the husband has every reason to be concerned. His wife wants to murder him and marry Bridges and the chief deputy sheriff kind of waffles on the idea. One night, the wife puts a knockout drug in the husband's drink and invites her boyfriend over to finish him off. Bridges freaks out, telling his galpal that murder is wrong and should never, ever be done. They put the husband in bed and he wakes up the next morning complaining of a hangover.

It is at this point that the movie lurches beyond the limits of believability. Bridges calls his gal and arranges for her to meet him at the abandoned lighthouse. There, he tells her that he's decided for reasons too sensitive to share with the audience that he's decided that she's right, that hubby must die so that they can get married and live happily everyafter. Not only that, but he's also come up with the neat idea of doing it in such a way that he can use his position to frame Sutherland for the murder. In other words, the chief deputy sheriff has decided in about 24 hours or so that not only is murder ok, its quite acceptable to frame an innocent man for a capital offense in Louisiana, where they take the death penalty very seriously.

Even more unbelievable is the fact that Bridges and his girl make their plans in Very Loud Voices so that Sutherland, who by the stroke of fate is also in the abandoned lighthouse, hears everything. Being a psycho, he plans on killing the husband himself, framing Bridges for the crime, and then blackmailing the girlfriend into marrying him. Of course he talks all this to himself so that the audience will both know his plans and that he is indeed a psycho.

From this point on, the movie becomes a mess of cliches, even messier than the swamps in the Louisiana county. You can predict every subsequent development all the way to the surprisingly dull climax. The movie ends with Bridges and his soon to be wife walking hand in hand down the road to their country estate in the sunset. Evil triumphs over evil and life continues on in the Louisiana county just as it always has.

The Killing Time is a movie that is an insult to the intelligence of the audience.",1176163200,4,4001,4.648725212464589
