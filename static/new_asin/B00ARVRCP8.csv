5495031,3,B00ARVRCP8,"Vampires who look like Radu generally aren't very interested in romance, because... well, how many Lestat/Edward fangirls are interested in a guy with a rubber mask face?

But the third Subspecies movie tries pretty hard to whip up a tragic love story subplot for the heretofore-uninterested-in-romance Radu. ""Bloodlust"" does suffer from a rather slow middle section, where nobody seems to be doing much except hanging around spinning their wheels, but it does try to flesh out the characters of Michelle and Radu.

Immediately after the end of the last movie, ""Mummy"" (Pamela Gordon) proves that Michelle (Denise Duff) CAN be useful. Specifically, her blood can resurrect Radu (Anders Hove), bringing him back to life for the second time. Immediately the trio magically flees back to Radu's castle in Transylvania, where Michelle promises to be loyal to Radu if he teaches her the ways of the vampire.

Meanwhile, Becky (Melanie Shatner) freaks out upon discovering that her sister has vanished yet again, and along with the chiseled love interest whose name I have completely forgotten, she begins searching for Michelle's whereabouts. But Michelle is slowly falling into the sway of evil, even as Radu seems to be falling in love with his ""pretty one.""

""Bloodlust"" is mostly composed of Becky and Designated Love Interest sniffing around for Radu, and Radu showing Michelle how to hunt pedestrians, turn into shadows and look longingly at the sunrise. That's it. Not much actually happens in this movie except that, except for brief periods at the beginning and end when things are much, much more more interesting.

Remember how most of Michelle's time in ""Subspecies II: Bloodstone"" was composed of running, crying and standing at clubs? It's sort of like that.

But the slowness is forgivable. Director Ted Nicolaou seems to be focusing more on character development than action. We still have some moments of hilarious B-movie gore (Mummy throws a knife that IMPALES A GUY'S HEAD), but Nicolaou is clearly much more interested in the slow moral slide of the ever-weepy Michelle (""Kill me, Radu"") and Radu's romantic interest in her.

Well, there are some flaws with that. Denise Duff's perpetually weepy acting really doesn't illustrate how Michelle is being tempted to the dark side. And Radu's sudden love for Michelle seems kind of... sudden. However, Anders Hove does an excellent job depicting a monstrous, evil creature who maybe, just maybe, is starting to regret his past actions and feel sad about the emptiness of his life (""Now I have it all... don't I, pretty one?""

""Bloodlust"" is a more character-driven piece than the previous two movies, trying to inject a little depth into Radu's character. Sadly, such cannot be said about ""Subspecies IV""...",1362096000,,2768,5.135555555555555

5495035,5,B00ARVRCP8,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I sometimes wonder if certain directors can read my mind.  These directors seem to have a direct link to my brain because they know exactly what I want in terms of movies.  Director Ted Nicolaou is one of these fabled few.  He is responsible for one of my favorite corn-ball, horror gore-flicks from the 80s, TERRORVISION.  But hes also the mastermind behind the SUBSPECIES series, a gothic vampire tale that is actually shot in Transylvania.  And if you have lost faith in vampires, give Nicolaou a try.  I doubt youll be disappointed.

SUBSPECIES 3: BLOODLUST is the most recent Blu-ray release in the series, and the fine folks at Full Moon Direct have done a marvelous job of bringing it to life in HD.

I am again impressed with how this film picks up literally just minutes after SUBSPECIES 2 ends.  The continuity is superb, although they probably shot these two films back-to-back to preserve that aspect.  Still, it makes for a great film experience.

SUBSPECIES 3: BLOODLUST is shot well and the HD transfer looks great onscreen.  Great care seems to have been taken in the restoration of the film; I saw a DVD version of this a while back, and the picture quality was nowhere near as good as this.  I tip my hat to Full Moon for their efforts.

The acting, again, is great with Anders Hove and Denice Duff reprising their roles.  Hove continues to shine as Radu.  The man has an amazing ability to act and sound the way I imagine a centuries-old bloodsucker would.

The special effects are very good as well, and we get more gore than the previous film.  I have to brag about the stop motion effects used for the little demon-imps.  For being a lower budget picture, the effects look awesome, and you can hardly tell it is stop motion.

SUBSPECIES 3: BLOODLUST is another big win for Full Moon, and I recommend it.",1452729600,2,1898,4.556213017751479

5495038,5,B00ARVRCP8,"Picking up the moment Bloodstone left off, Michelle (Denice Duff) is in the vile clutches of Mummy (Pamela Gordon). Using her blood, Mummy resurrects Radu (Anders Hove). Outside the crypt, Rebecca has called Lieutenant Marin (Ion Haiduc) and Mel Thompson (Kevin Blair) who have surrounded the place with police. Fearing capture  or worse  Radu invokes a spell that transports the trio back to Castle Vladislas. Its here that Michelle seems to accept her fate as Radus fledgling and urges him to teach her the ways of the vampire. However, Mummy fears that Michelle will be their downfall and orders Radu to destroy her. Now conflicted Radu must decide whether to keep the one he loves or destroy her to keep his own life.

Of the three films this one has the thinnest plot consisting mostly of Radu and Michelle exchanging dialogue with Mummy warning Radu that Michelle needs to be destroyed before she destroys both of them. This one also features the most comedy, making it an uneven film, though one moment featuring Radu with a gun to his head is played to comic perfection.

Like the previous film, this one looks nothing short of spectacular. Most films that are mostly dark tend to look washed out, but this one looks great. The blacks are deep, dark and consistent throughout with the occasional daytime scene providing colors that really pop.

The special features here are a bit of a mixed bag. First up is the commentary track from writer/director Ted Nicoleau, Denice Duff and Anders Hove. Its a little livelier than the previous films track, but is still a bit frustrating as most of the time is devoted to describing the action on screen, though a few anecdotes make their way in saving this from being too dull. Once again, Anders Hove is rather quiet, though not as much as the previous film. His interjections are more frequent and a very welcome relief from the previous films lackluster track.

Next up is where things get frustrating. We have the Recollections segment from the previous film. I mean its exactly the same. Every word, frame and cut identical. It would have been nice to have a second talk devoted solely to this film, but sadly no. The only features unique to this disc is the commentary and the original Video Zone from when this was released back in 1993.

Like the film itself, the features feel like they never truly come out of the shadow of the previous installment, which is sad because this franchise had some real potential. Still, though, if you're a fan of this series youll still want to pick this bad boy up simply for the look and sound. That alone is worth the price.",1405123200,2,2618,4.703056768558952
5495039,3,B00ARVRCP8,"Overall a fun watch for fans of the franchise, but it's lost a good bit of the joie de vive that fueled part 2 and made part 1 a breakthrough DTV film.

SIDEBAR:  This was filmed back to back with Subspecies II, which follows in the spirit of the franchise by picking up exactly where this movie ends.

Michelle's sister Becky narrates as this sequel picks up immediately where Subspecies II left off:  After defeating Radu (Anders Hove; Subspecies I-IV, Critters 4), Becky must wait until dark to escape with her vampire sister Michelle (Denice Duff; Subspecies II-IV), who is abducted in the final moments by Radu's ""Mummy"" (Pamela Gordon; Weird Science, Poltergeist II, Subspecies II), a crone-like ghoul akin to an unwrapped mummy.

While not holding a candle to the AMAZING opening scene of Subspecies II, Bloodlust opens with a brief, concerted effort at delivering some gore, wincing wrist slicing and face stabs to get us excited in this sequel's opening.  During this scene, Mummy resurrects Radu and the two of them steal Michelle away because, evidently, Michelle and Radu are to be bound together forever.  That's Radu's idea anyway.

With little contribution from Lt. Marin, Becky and embassy representative Mel continue to try to save Michelle for the entire second act of the movie.  This portion of the story is slow, unexciting, and hardly informative--it just drags.  Meanwhile Mummy whispers poison in Radu's ear in hopes that he'll destroy Michelle instead of weaning her away from her ties to mortality.  Ignoring the classic adage that ""evil witch vampire Mummy knows best,"" Radu teaches Michelle to focus her heightened senses, move through the shadows and hunt human prey.

Normally these vampire tutoring/self-realization scenes are great (e.g., Interview with a Vampire ). But they are just okay and mostly serve to convey Michelle's eventual disgust for this kind of life.

Mummy gets a of screen time and action in this movie--plus a lot of bickering with her son Radu.  Not that I'm not entertained by this, but it made the movie feel less serious and more bonkers, much as the undead Toulon did for Puppet Master II (1991).  To that end, the finale didn't really offer much in the way of action except for Radu's final moments (which was a cool, but brief death).  I find this to be a shame since Subspecies and the first 10 minutes of Subspecies II (in combination) make for a damn fine piece of work making a B+ movie from a B-budget.

As for the story This entire film was about Radu's imaginary romance with Michelle, which was never reciprocated, and Michelle's acclimation to vampirism.  While I understood what the writer/director (Ted Nicolaou) was trying to do, it wasn't done very effectively.  Moreover the subspecies demons, for which this franchise was named, do not even appear until the final few minutes of this film and the bloodstone, for which part 2 was named, played no bigger role in part 2 than in parts 1 or 3.

Part 3 is still overall a fun watch, but it's lost a good bit of the joie de vive that fueled part 2 and made part 1 a breakthrough DTV film.  I'm sorry to say that director Ted Nicolaou (Subspecies I-II, Terror Vision, Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys) lost the inertia that started this franchise so powerfully.",1385856000,,3276,4.824686940966011

8557037,5,B00ARVRCP8,This 1 was another great movie in the Radu series. He's an awesome & scary vampire. We love the Full Moon series & it's a sick addition to the collection!,1529798400,,154,4.166666666666667
8557038,4,B00ARVRCP8,"Just edges out S2 as my favorite in this hugely entertaining vampire series, mostly on the strength of Anders Hove and Denise Duff's performances. Same basic plot: Rebecca and her Fearless Vampire Stalkers continue where they left off, in pursuit of her sister Michelle, Radu, and the Bloodstone; while Radu tries futilely to gain the love and loyalty of his adamantly defiant ""fledgling"", Michelle.

Hove has completely sounded the depths of Radu's character and his portrayal of this tragic monster is poignant and heartfelt. Unable to command his headstrong protg's fealty to the master she refuses to acknowledge, unable to win her heart with gifts or intimate displays of trust, Radu's despair is utterly human, yet he never turns on her. Despite his constant praise of pain and suffering, his deathly face conceals a heart capable of loyal and true love.

As for Denise Duff as Michelle, she is probably the coolest vampiress EVER, and if it not for Radu would no-doubt be the star of this series. The Subspecies movies deserve acclaim for their strong female characters, and Michelle is the toughest, a determinedly human woman who resists becoming a vampire with every fiber of her strength and will. At the same time, we see her grow in undead power and skill, and realize that if she keeps control of the Bloodstone - with which she can resist the need to kill - she'll become an immortal to reckon with. Her scenes with Radu are really something to see, as the two vampires match wills eye-to-eye again and again, and she forces Radu to blink every time.

Their story is truly ""Beauty and the Beast"" without the happy ending, and indeed it's hard not to think of that classic story in the sequence where Michelle begs to see her sister just one last time. Like the Beast, Radu is unwilling to let his ""pretty one"" go, but gives his permission, hoping to prove his love by a gesture of faith in her; and just as in the fairy tale, his hopeful gesture has sad consequences. The look on his face as she sweeps past him while he pleads for her devotion could bring a tougher fan than me to tears. --These are some of the best characterizations in modern vampire film, and among the very few that I really care about.",1524355200,,2223,4.665816326530612

8557045,5,B00ARVRCP8,"Lest we forget where the last film left off, this one begins with an unhelpful reminder of it.  And then pushing forward, we see the police mosey about, above the crypt, doubtful as to what just happened.  They do, however, have a souvenir to ponder, the late lamented professor Popescu.  Meanwhile, deep below the hubbub, Mummy is tending to her precious son Radu and, reluctantly, his desire Michelle.  She cackles, sets a spell, and POOF, they're transported to the castle where Mummy will keep insisting on occupying the throne thats not hers.  And what a pretty pickle they have now, with live Becky reluctant to give up on her decidedly dead sister Michelle.  Fortunately, Mel the US Embassy lackey has connections!  Okay, only the one, CIA Bob, his climbing buddy.  Hes great at scaling walls, but severely lacking in skills requiring one to duck at the opportune moment.

At this point Im beginning to feel sorry for poor Radu.  His Mummy is a nag (Destroy her!).  Michelle is fickle.  Poor Radu, who only moments before chortles at the idea of vampires loving anyone not their food, suddenly reduced to pledging his undying devotion to the miserable faithless Michelle.  He even lets her bite him!  He gives her jewelry (all right, he borrowed the trinket from Mummy.  She was not pleased, You are forbidden my spoils!).
