3775,5,076700941X,"I am new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs, but this (the fourth) season is the best season I've watched so far. For those of you who are new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs,  this series is a character driven drama which focuses on the disparate (but yet entwined) lives of the rich Bellamy's and their servants.
Character growth, loss, tragedy and triumph are the themes of this season, as the characters are greatly affected by the trials of world war I.  I highly recommend this for fans of this time period, or fans of BBC drama. I particularly liked the character arc involving Edward the footman, and the arc involving Hazel Bellamy. This is truly an excellent series, I am sorry that it was ended after the fifth season.",1052265600,7,734,4.595419847328245
3776,5,076700941X,"This series is my favorite in the Upstairs Downstairs canon.  The residents of 165 Eaton Place face the loss and hardships of World War I bravely.  Several important themes, such as duty, honor, love and loss are explored through the lives of several characters.  War comes home, literally, when a Zeppelin drops a bomb on Eaton Place.  James, Edward, Georgina, and most tragically Rose and Hazel are all victims of the war's bloodlust.  There are some extremely fine moments, such as when Georgina sees some wounded soldiers and realizes her playgirl life has to stop, and some extremely funny ones, as in the episode when the Bellamy's drawingroom is commandeered for a dreary charity event.  With this series the writers and artists reached their height!",1032652800,15,757,5.016
3777,2,076700941X,"This is a wonderful classic.  I have purchased each season as it has become available on DVD.  I am usually very happy with A&E's DVD's, but I am not sure what went wrong with, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"".  Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it.  Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD.  I know I will continue to purchase each season, because I really enjoyed the series when it was on television, but I wish the quality was better.",1029715200,9,517,4.457446808510638
3778,5,076700941X,"When television was reaching for the stars this series which lasted 5 years was like a rocketship in the anals of entertainment. Thirty years later it is still totally absorbing, sophisticated, and fun to watch. It is a classic that my husband and I re-visited recently over a period of several months. If you missed Upstairs Downstairs in the '70's don't miss it now if you can help it. A combination of a British soap opera, classical drama and comedy, we got totally involved in the family upstairs, and the second family of servants, downstairs. It's a hoot.",1014336000,9,562,4.744897959183674

3815,5,076700941X,I enjoyed all episodes and it's good to see how the English lived through WWI.  They had a much harder time of it since the war came to their homeland.  Hazel is my favorite character.,1408838400,,184,4.228571428571429

3817,5,076700941X,"The only disappointment was when Meg Wynn Owen Left the series. Although married to somewhat disagreeable James, Hazel could hold her own, and had more compassion for the servants Downstairs. Lord Bellamy needed a wife, so Virginia was added to replace Hazel. Edward and Daisy were a cute couple. Rose was just as loyal as ever. Mrs. Bridges was always proud of her kitchen art. Hudson was a snob, and Ruby was a likeable dimwit.",1407974400,,429,4.733333333333333

3819,5,076700941X,"Superb to return to: still, I think, the best of the many television serials. Season 4 is a moving commemoration of the World War I Centennial as the war decimated all classes. This long but tightly-organized serial never loses focus: the 1929 crash that ends it returns, darkly, to the comic Edwardian beginning.",1406332800,,313,4.9245283018867925
3820,4,076700941X,Very well done. I had heard people talking allot about this during it'd time but did not get to watch it till now. The characters were wonderful. I became so involved that there were times I cried. A really top drawer series.,1406073600,,225,4.380952380952381

3823,4,076700941X,Plots are better than in season 3.  Main complaint is lack of closed captions.  I need that with British shows.,1402790400,,111,4.5
3824,5,076700941X,Loved this series.  Watched all the seasons and must say had a wonderful journey through time.  A lot of the story I had missed when originally saw it on PBS.  Such a fantastic cast and presentation of the Victorian Era.,1402704000,,220,4.45
3825,5,076700941X,"With waiting for the new season of Downton Abbey, I decided to get my Edwardian fix from Upstairs Downstairs. To say the least I see that Downton was greatly ""inspired"" by this series. I recognize some of the plot lines and characters, with different names of course. I highly recommend the entire series, must start at the beginning, with the first episodes being somewhat less sophisticated than the later. A good watch for those waiting for Downton.",1402531200,,452,4.883116883116883
3826,5,076700941X,"I missed this when it was originally broadcast and have often expressed my regrets to others over the years. Imagine my delight when it was offered to prime members. I've not been disappointed. I find the story lines entertaining and more racey than I expected, given the time it was originally produced.

3827,3,076700941X,"I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child. I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey. I really liked the first season of the series. I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2, #3 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch. I watched it to finish out the series. It is not as good as the previous seasons.",1400371200,,647,4.225806451612903
3828,5,076700941X,"I loved all of Upstairs, Downstairs when it came out decades ago, and I still do. But it is after all a high class soap opera, and if that is not your thing you may not care for it. I find it to be excellently crafted, cast and acted. Very rich visually and it seems to give an excellent feel for the time and a different culture and value system than today's. Not sure which is best.",1399248000,,384,4.0
3829,5,076700941X,"After the very first episode, I was unable to stop and continued to watch all the Seasons every chance I got. Superb story lines, excellent acting. Love watching movies in that era and seeing how they cooked every meal from scratch and by hand without any modern conveniences. The cooks spent their entire day in the kitchen making meals.  Interesting to realize how many cooking products we have today to lessen our time in the kitchen!",1399248000,,437,4.75

The fourth season of, Downton Abbey failed in my opinion, especially in connecting the last few minutes of Season 3  with the first few minutes of the first episode of Season 4.",1398470400,,371,4.676923076923077

3838,4,076700941X,"The characters in Upstairs/downstairs improve each season, both in depth and complexity as well as being easier to identify with.

Yes, I have thoroughly enjoyed Downtown Abbey, but this is certainly comparable. The Abbey  is far more imposing and family members and servants more numerous, but you can binge watch several seasons of Upstairs Downstairs and enjoy the Bellamys and Hudson and his crew.",1396224000,,375,5.216666666666667

3846,5,076700941X,In the 70's I was living mostly out of the country or away from a television.  I enjoy Brittish drama and humor so this was a good way for me to catch up on an old classic.

 Much interweaving of personalities, situations and difficulties.  I truly enjoyed each episode and could hardly wait to finish the series.  Acting and costuming were good.  Only one thing I would say was disappointing--that last suicide!
Three suicides in one series is a bit much.  Otherwise, I loved it.",1392249600,,368,5.169491525423729

I liked that one, not as much as DA, but it did start growing on me.  Then when that ended, I found the original Upstairs Downstairs.  Different feel, and film quality, but I fell in love with it.  Some of the episodes with Elizabeth grated on me...  Overall, it was just a very well done series.

I watched every episode of all five seasons, and was so sorry to see it end!!  But the ending of the series was done so well.

The class structure, the changes that came with the 1914-18 war, the entrenched attitudes that resisted the changes and the frustration felt by those bringing in the new ideas.  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is also there and made me so sad that it was not recognised for what it was.  But the most beautiful thing about all these episodes is of course, the relationship between upstairs and downstairs.  It makes one aware that the boundaries of what we consider family can stretch and stretch.  The actors are superb and I wonder where they are now.  It is just a perfect slice of England and the English with all our prejudices and funny ways of doing things - stiff upper lip, public school - but everyone just muddles along and makes their way through all the turmoil.  A really fine series that I will enjoy watching again and again.",1365465600,,937,4.541666666666667

3918,5,076700941X,"This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.

The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).

I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Four is as interesting as the previous three seasons - the writing is always great, and the ensemble cast continues to amaze with their wonderful acting talents.

This fourth season of the show sees WW I in full swing - James Bellamy returns from the front for a break and finds himself consigned to a desk job (even though he still travels), something which sits very badly with a man who yearns to join his regiment in the thick of battle; Hazel and James' marriage is not altogether happy, a recurring theme from the later part of Season Three, but the war has sort of masked their marital difficulties; footman Edward marries his sweetheart, parlour maid Daisy, and also goes off to war; many from below stairs contribute what they can to the war effort - kitchen maid Ruby goes off to work in a munitions factory, Rose works part-time as a tram conductor, and butler Hudson works part-time in the constabulary. Mr. Bellamy, Sr. gets offered a key government post and ward Georgina tries her hand at nursing.

As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices. This is one of the best British period dramas I've ever watched, and that's saying a lot given the vast number of BBC period dramas I've amassed over the years. I plan to get the 40th Anniversary DVD of all five seasons of this show to add to my collection. Upstairs Downstairs is truly a timeless classic",1332374400,,3282,4.841354723707665

After watching the first season of Upstairs, Downstairs via Amazon Instant Download (free for Prime members), I was so captivated by this well-written and credibly acted series that I purchased the rest of the series (via instant download) and have been enjoying the show since (except for Season 5 which is sadly not available via streaming).

This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.

The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).

I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Four is as interesting as the previous three seasons - the writing is always great, and the ensemble cast continues to amaze with their wonderful acting talents.

This fourth season of the show sees WW I in full swing - James Bellamy returns from the front for a break and finds himself consigned to a desk job (even though he still travels), something which sits very badly with a man who yearns to join his regiment in the thick of battle; Hazel and James' marriage is not altogether happy, a recurring theme from the later part of Season Three, but the war has sort of masked their marital difficulties; footman Edward marries his sweetheart, parlour maid Daisy, and also goes off to war; many from below stairs contribute what they can to the war effort - kitchen maid Ruby goes off to work in a munitions factory, Rose works part-time as a tram conductor, and butler Hudson works part-time in the constabulary. Mr. Bellamy, Sr. gets offered a key government post and ward Georgina tries her hand at nursing.

As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices. This is one of the best British period dramas I've ever watched, and that's saying a lot given the vast number of BBC period dramas I've amassed over the years. I plan to get the 40th Anniversary DVD of all five seasons of this show to add to my collection. Upstairs Downstairs is truly a timeless classic!",1330905600,2,3874,4.7976011994003
3921,1,076700941X,"This review is about Amazon's hosting of the fourth season, not about the season itself.  The fourth season is a great one, but the way Amazon has bungled this makes it hard to enjoy it.

It is really annoying that they have messed up the episodes by putting them in the wrong order and mislabeling them.  Half the tension in the episode they list as first is confusing if you haven't watched the THREE episodes that predate it.  The occasional mislabeled episode in the previous seasons was easy to overlook, but in this case, its flat out unprofessional.

Also, I bought the season, and yet still had to purchase two of the episodes separately.

If Amazon really wants to make their video streaming the place to go, they'll have to avoid these things in future.",1328745600,9,763,4.614814814814815
3922,5,076700941X,"The whole series is wonderful.  My only disappointment with the versions I have ordered so far is that there is are no subtitles, and the spoken English dialect is sometimes very hard to follow.  Would really be nice to have the captions.  Other than that, this was in excellent condition and received very promptly.",1327795200,,316,4.814814814814815
3923,5,076700941X,"The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic nostalgic time-travel covering 1912-1914, pre-World War One.
Richard Bellamy (David Langton) and house heir James (Simon Williams) need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Also stars Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do'). Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy.

A TV gem period series. This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. Series 4 alone won ""Outstanding Limited Series"" plus a second Emmy. Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. It is available in a complete collection, highly recommended if you do not own any of the sets individually.

SERIES 4: 13 wartime episodes averaging 51 minutes each cover years 1914-18. The Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but also historical look at WWI, on the London home front. You get romance mingled in with the troubles of wartime.

3925,5,076700941X,"This series is so amazingly captivating, I'm glad I never had the time to see it before.  For one thing, I'd never have been able to get through nursing school taking time to watch TV, and for another I'd never have lived through waiting for the next episode.  I'm way too much of an immediate needs gratification sort of person!!

The setting is a period to which I have become more and more attracted, the two decades between World War I and World War II.  Times are changing, but not necessarily for the better, or at least not for everyone.  The old guard is losing its hold over society, but those newly rising to power are not necessarily better than those who wielded it before.  If anything the old guard, based as it was on a landed aristocracy with a vested interest in England as a property, had reasons to keep things from falling totally apart for the middle and lower classes.  Their pride of place came as much from their perceived obligations as from their assets.  The rising nouveaux riche are vested in money alone, a portable commodity that can be invested wherever there is profit to be had.  Their focus is on who has the most of it; without ties to anything, they take no responsibility for the society that makes their fortunes.  Theirs were the ideals upon which our present world and its predicaments are based.

The characters of the series are reflections of the changing times.  The Upstairs family sees the pater familias, an aristocratic man of conservative principles, losing ground to the younger members of the family who are going through the emotional ravages of World War I.  They question everything and challenge many of the basic principles of social behavior, including the roles of women, political power and who should wield it, and the behavior of society during war.  Below stairs, too, there is disruption.  The younger generation questions the reasons for the demand for ""gratitude"" for their position of servitude and see the efforts of the butler to prevent their adopting new ideals as repressive and patronizing.  They question the need to ask the family they serve for permission to marry, to hold a war job, to question their additional work load without commensurate compensation.

Upstairs Downstairs is a world in flux, much like our own, and the efforts of the extended family to adjust to it are absolutely mesmerizing.",1282003200,,2377,4.800982800982801

Season 4 was not one of my favorite years for the show, although the cast almost stayed the same, with the exeption of a few new one's, it built up to Season 5, the last year for the series. It is still a good show to watch, and a splendid period piece as well.",1274659200,,370,3.8181818181818183
