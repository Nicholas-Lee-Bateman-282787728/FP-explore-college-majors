8521238,4,B000RJEIT8,There have been a multitude of TV treatments of Maigret.  This one can be regarded as one of the best.  Michael Gambon personifies the character  created by Georges Simenon.  The only flaw in production is the substitution of Budapest for Paris but at least the postwar grim is vividly depicted.  Collectors seeking a sampling of Simenon's output should for for this one with confidence.,1423353600,,387,4.984375
