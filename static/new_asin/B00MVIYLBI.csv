6602654,4,B00MVIYLBI,"If a horror flick has a clown in it, you can guarantee it will be on my Must Watch List.  Many people are afraid of or creeped out by clowns, which is part of what makes these painted mysteries so delicious when they are served up in horror films.  But the other half is simply what we do not know about them:  who are they behind the mask?  The same could be said for slasher fiends like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers.  GINGERCLOWN is a fun and horrific romp into clown-horror territory, but its not what you think.  This isn't Stephen Kings IT redone or anything like that.  Oh, nothis is so much better!

This movie is not excellent, but it is certainly entertaining and definitely a lot of fun.  It boasts an all-star cast (or rather the voices of these all-stars) and some zany special effects.  At times, it feels like an old Peter Jackson horror filmbut it also reminds me of a Joe Bob Briggs Drive-in trash title.

GINGERCLOWN is shot well, and I wish I could have watched it in 3D, which is how it was originally released overseas.  The cinematic style seems to rely heavily on the 3D aspect, and I think many of the frights would have been more effective that way.

The acting quality is a mix.  The voice actors are excellent, with headliners Tim Curry, Sean Young, Lance Henriksen, and Brad Dourif doling out quips and one-liners as their monstrous characters terrorize the youngsters.  The physical actors, however, are only slightly above par.  This could be due in part to a stiff script.  Or, it could be a result of these foreign actors trying to speak without an accent.  Im not sure of the reason, but their performances come across as lacking.

The special effects in GINGERCLOWN are great, with some exotic monstrosities that will make you cringe and yet smile.  Several of the creatures have a sort of Full Moon Features feel, while others are just downright terrifying.  But they are all effective and, well, fun.

My sole complaint about the film is the lack of explanation for most of what is happening.  Sure, we get to see why the kids go into the amusement parkbut we never learn who the monsters are (technically) or why they are there.  The average viewer might overlook this (I did), but some folks will want to know more info.

GINGERCLOWN will not win any awards, but its a quirky horror flick that fans of the genre will enjoy.  Chocked full of bizarre monsters and surrealistic settings, this is one film you certainly have to see to appreciate.  It hits store shelves tomorrow (Tuesday), so make a note.",1415577600,3,2542,4.566371681415929

6602656,4,B00MVIYLBI,"If  you're looking for some good laughs and a bad script this is it. It resembles those corny, cheap 1970's horror flicks, and it's so bad, I had to laugh. That said, I can't help it. I loved this movie. The monsters are ugly and sticky looking, and a nerd kid takes a dare seriously and enters a closed fun park. So worried is another girl, that she ends up following him, despite her nasty boyfriend's insults. There is a lot of the eff word, but who cares?",1420243200,,459,4.215909090909091

6602659,1,B00MVIYLBI,"How can you go wrong in a horror film that stars Tim Curry (I.T/Rock Horror), Brad Dourif (Chucky), Lance Hendrickson (Pumpkin Head), Michael Winslow (Police Academy/Spaceballs) and Sean Young (Blade Runner/AceVentura)? Well, I guess we blame it on Balzs Hatvani who wrote and directed this garbage.

So the done to death plot is about a bunch of jocks who dare the geeky kid to go into the abandoned amusement park that hasn't been opened in years. Of coarse it was once tried to be re-opened, but more deaths occurred. I guess you could say it's trying to pay homage to classic horrors who have used that idea to death, such as Friday The 13th and what not... but, meh, what drills this film into the ground is the horrible, and I mean, horrible acting. I'm not exactly sure what year this was supposed to be set in, but it felt very 50's with the jocks dress sense and hair styles, however there was some mention of the 60's, so I dunno when it's supposed to be, but as confusing as that was, it just doesn't matter enough to care about after seeing how the rest of this god awful thing plays out.

So the dweeb goes into the park, and then the hot chick follows, and before you know it more have ventured into this place that just happens to still be there... abandoned or not, it seems to be in pretty good shape and no one around notices the place is lighting up and working at night. sigh, whatever... so a bunch of creatures come out at night, stupid demonic teapots and goofy puppet looking things from The Dark Crystal as well as anything else that wouldn't even fool a child was supposed to be scary. It's like the film doesn't take itself seriously, and is aware of it, yet fails to be funny. The heroine of the film is annoying and does the typical non stop screaming with a god awful accent, and her jock ex-boyfriend should be banned from ever attempting to act ever again. But what's even worse is the utter lack of use of the actual stars talent in this. Even tho I suspect most of it is just voice work, and not them actually in the suits or operating puppts, it's a no wonder none of them have mentioned this film in interviews.

I remember this being up on IMDB a few years ago and it just kept saying it's release date was TBA, and even when it said it was released last year, I have had trouble finding it up until recently. I guess when a film is shelved for so long, and you can't even find it to download, you should just give up and forget about it instead of keeping an eye out now and then for it to surface. After seeing it now, I know why. It wouldn't surprise me if Balzs Hatvani had to pay out Lionsgate to distribute this thing for him. How someone can bring together a cast like this and just FUBAR it is beyond me. I don't wanna waste another moment reviewing this, just avoid it if you can.",1419033600,4,2826,4.288389513108614
6602660,2,B00MVIYLBI,"This one was a tough call for me.  Although the premise of the movie is not new (think ""Funhouse"" or ""Dark Ride""), the movie did have some originality to it.  Nerd-on-a-dare goes to an abandoned amusement park to prove his manhood to a hot chick and her jock boyfriend.  That's pretty run-of-the-mill stuff; it's what he/she encounters while inside that is pretty mind-blowing:  foul-mouthed dishes, a talking t*rd, a spider who deals in riddles, and basically creatures you could never imagine (unless you had a little help from some mushrooms).  What I didn't understand was there were no clowns.  The name is what drew me to this movie, so I feel rather cheated.

Other reviewers have commented on the ""great special effects"" this movie has.  I hate to disagree...but I'm going to disagree.  These were some of the cheapest, lamest, and awful effects I've ever seen.  I understand (from reading another review) that this movie was originally filmed in 3-D, and I, too, wish I could have seen it in that format.  Perhaps that would have helped the believability of what was on screen.  Unfortunately, what you see is, well, what you get--and that ain't much.  One of the worst was the talking spider, which I honestly believe I could have made a better one.  (NOTE to production staff:  A spider's legs go OUT from its body; they all don't ""hang"" behind its head).

Rated R for language and violence, ""Gingerclown"" was neither funny nor scary.  I won't completely pan it because there was some originality to it.  You decide for yourself.",1418947200,2,1540,4.812977099236641
6602661,3,B00MVIYLBI,"No real scares, but shot in a novel way in that it purposefully reimagines the classic horror movie feel in an artistically interesting way. This is not your usual fare, in that regard. The filmmakers did a noteworthy job in their homage to 70s horror films that include what amounts to parody of the cliched overacting and dialogue from that era. Again, I didn't get any scares or thrills from this one, but if you check out the trailer, it will give you a very solid idea of what to expect. That Lionsgate was involved tells you up front that it's going to be well-financed with good production values, and it is definitely not your microbudget, weekend-shoot horror so prevalent today. I'd say it's worth a rental and would recommend it for horror fans (I don't think non-horror fans would really ""get"" the many inside jokes and the homage-style it presents).",1418428800,,862,4.71523178807947

Tim Curry , Sean Young, Michael Winslow, Lance Hendricksen, and Brad Dourif are all weird, swearing puppets in this MST3K demanding masterpiece. A lot of the scenery and design remind me of Tim Burton's Ed Wood's spook ride. The creatures could definitely inhabit the Monkeybone, Cabin Boy, Pee Wee's Big Adventure universe. And outside of 50's teens (set in 1983) get lost in a haunted amusement park there isn't much of a movie but it's fun to watch. 4 Donuts out of 5.
