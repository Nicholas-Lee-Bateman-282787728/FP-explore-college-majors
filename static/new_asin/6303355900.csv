8156247,5,6303355900,"""The Adventures of Rusty"" made in 1945 was the beginning of a series of 8
Rusty movies about a boy and his dog which commenced in 1945 and
finished in 1949, all of which starred Ted Donaldson as a boy named
Danny Mitchell.

The complete series which was made by Columbia Pictures has to date
never been released on DVD.  However, there are 3 titles currently available
on VHS and ""The Adventures of Rusty"" which was the first title is one
of them.  The picture quality and sound of the tape is outstanding and
whilst I am not a lover of dogs, I must admit that Rusty is a fine looking
animal and the movie contains many interesting ideas to assist a boy to
train his dog to be obedient, faithful and basically the type of dog that he
wants it to be.

The movie is good entertainment in the old tradition where the entire family
could gather and be entertained and to-day's animation which clutters up the
airways, thankfully was confined to the Disney domain.

The main stars of the movie are:
Ted Donaldson as Danny Mitchell (the young son)
Margaret Lindsay as Ann Mitchell (the new step-mother)
Conrad Nagel as Hugh Mitchell (the father).

The story centres on young Danny who fearing that his recently acquired
step-mother is competing with him for his father's affections and saddened
by the death of his dog, he seeks consolation in his new found friendship with a
ferocious Nazi-trained Police dog named Rusty, brought to the US by a
returned World War II veteran.

Rusty is both savage and disobedient and seems to be set on causing as much
trouble as possible.  Training the dog to amend his bad ways and settling
down to a normal life would be a tremendous job for Danny but a job that he
tackles with enthusiasm.

This is a good, solid story and its success was no doubt an inspiration for more
to come.  Ted Donaldson is a competent and charming young actor capable
of delivering a wide range of emotions.  In fact he is my favourite young actor
having appeared in many early successful movies such as ""A Tree Grows in
Brooklyn"" and ""The Red Stallion"".

Highly recommended.
