8113883,3,B000ERVKGM,I wish they'd put the original series on DVD SOOOO bad!  I mean they have all this other stuff...  why not the best?!  Makes no sense to me.,1374451200,,140,3.9285714285714284
8113884,4,B000ERVKGM,"Good show when it was on TV, especially liked the theme played throughout.  Mike Hammer is the epitome of a PI.  Enjoyable.",1368748800,,123,4.545454545454546
8113885,5,B000ERVKGM,"If you have never read Mickey Spillane, then you might just be at somewhat of a loss with the Mike Hammer movies and the series, but if you are a Stacy Keach fan,
then it probably won't matter.  Mike is an old style, hard-boiled private eye, and Songbird is just another fine example of the genre.  Shannon Whirry plays Velda, Mike's
right-hand lady and the one who runs his office with style and grace and more than a bit of good looks.  If you happen to be a fan of Sam Spade, then you will be
right at home with Songbird.

The blues/jazz music in this episode sets the mood and the voice over projects the viewer right smack in the middle of the action.
Stacy Keach has always been my favorite as Mike Hammer, he has a smooth easy going style that grows on you before the first viewing is over.
You will either be hooked by Hammer or vow to never watch another one, but I bet it is the first

Like a jigsaw puzzle, Mike slowly puts the pieces in place, so that in the end, we all know what the big picture really looks like.

There is enough intrigue to keep one interested, but not so much as to muddy the waters when it comes to the plot.

There are no outstanding special effects or super-hero feats here, just good old fashioned, private eye, running down the clues, and catching the bad guys type of action.",1356393600,,1315,4.236

8113887,3,B000ERVKGM,"There are so many versions of Mike Hammer available on DVD, except for the classic 80's show that had a short but great run.  Unfortunately it has never seen the light of day on DVD and a lot of people are looking for it.

One way to get the ball rolling to get this classic show released onto DVD is to go straight to the source and let them know you want it. Go to

Scroll to the bottom of the page and under ""About Us"" click on ""product suggestions"" and let them know you want to have the 80's Mike Hammer show on DVD. Consider all the crap that gets released on DVD. This was a great show and Stacy Keach at his best with the character.  If they don't know there are people who want it, it won't get released.",1326672000,,720,4.006993006993007
8113888,3,B000ERVKGM,"I dig Mike Hammer. And actor Stacey Keach is P.I. Mike Hammer as I imagine him. That's why I believe author M. Spillane's fictional tough-guy character as best played by Keach is the definitive private eye (other fine work by Keach includes his portrayal of writer Ernest Hemingway in a now rare 1980s mini series). While the very best Keach-Hammer series is the one first broadcast on CBS-TV during the 1980s, this later feature-length offering is from the low-budget, 1990s independent revival series; but don't be fooled; it is still top-notch entertainment with some very sexy ladies along for fun and cocktails.",1304553600,,616,5.049019607843137
8113889,5,B000ERVKGM,"Writer Mickey Spillane brought forth an ex-military, private detective who is tough,
charming, morally upright, yet possessed with an insatiable desire to throttle thugs,
capture crooks, and aid ladies in distress.
What new can one write about Stacy Keach's perfectly-portrayed Mike Hammer?
Do you enjoy listening to blues music and enjoy Mike's tough tactics with two-bit thugs?
Then 'Songbird' is for you.",1234224000,,407,5.580645161290323
8113890,4,B000ERVKGM,"For fans of the old Mickey Spillane books, here is Mike Hammer personified by the unflappable Stacy Keach.  Back in the days when men were real men and women were all good looking and ready to jump Mike's bones, Hammer moves through the city like drain-o through a clogged pipe, clearing out the gunky bad guys.  Yeah, I know, this applies to all of the Mike Hammer TV series and made for TV movies, but what can I say?  I love the guy.  For those of you tired of the My Special Effects Are Better Than Your Special Effects one-upmanship of todays senselessly violent mindless entertainment, check out the Good Old Days of a series that aged well.  Thumbs up.",1206576000,,659,4.458333333333333
