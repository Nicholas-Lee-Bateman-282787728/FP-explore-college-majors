2941451,5,B000VFIDT4,Great video for anyone looking to get into shape or learn some new bhangra dance moves.  The video has an introductory section teaching all the individual moves step by step so you can follow along at your own pace- great for beginners.  The high energy dance workout section has a great upbeat tempo making it seem like you're having fun rather than working out.  I also like that the moves are repeated so you have time to learn the moves as you go.  I would definitely recommend this video.,1193529600,4,493,4.50561797752809
2941452,5,B000VFIDT4,"This Bhangra workout DVD is a must buy!!!  It's a full body workout, and Bhangra dance class all in one.  It's totally fun and for all ages.  Whether you're looking to get in shape or learn some of the latest Bhangra dance moves, Bhangra Beats:Round 1 is the way to go!!!",1192406400,,271,4.2745098039215685
2941453,5,B000VFIDT4,"I have had this workout dvd for the past two months and I cannot say enough positive things about it!  The step by step directions are good enough to have you readily participating in the entire workout and will move you from the sidelines to the middle of the dance floor at your next party.  Even my parents and siblings got in on the action, which led to some quality family time!

Definitely a good buy!",1192406400,2,407,4.328947368421052
8218567,2,B000VFIDT4,"The music was bad, the instructor was boring, it seem like it was done in his living room (nothing wrong) but it was horrible, the music was bad, I had to throw it away. One of the worst purchases I made in a very long time.",1361750400,,224,3.891304347826087
8218568,1,B000VFIDT4,"This video is fine for people who know nothing about bhangra and don't care to learn true bhangra.  But if you want to learn real bhangra and the correct names for each step, this is the wrong video for you. It is obvious this guy does not know anything about real bhangra. Having been the captain of a competitive bhangra team, I am embarrassed that this video exists. The names for each step are a real mockery to a true bhangra dancer/lover.",1349568000,,444,4.414634146341464
8218569,5,B000VFIDT4,"Absolutely loved it.  I sweat just doing the intro break downs!  A lot of great moves.  Although at times Jay seemed a little humbled and had trouble looking into the camera, flash cards?  I'm sure Round 2 will be better.  When can we expect it?",1272844800,,245,4.355555555555555
8218570,2,B000VFIDT4,I like the instructor and his moves. He made a good job BUT the problem for me is that the music is off-sync with the moves 50% of the session. It makes it difficult to enjoy. But I do like the choreography and I think it's a shame the music production is off beat.,1269734400,2,265,3.925925925925926
8218571,5,B000VFIDT4,"I love this DVD!  I have been a belly dancer for many years, and wanted to learn some other forms of dance that could be blended with belly dance - this DVD was a great introduction to bhangra, the basics of the foot and leg work, arm positions, etc.  It's really helpful for demonstrating some of the core moves in a clearly-described and patient manner!

This is a very physically demanding form of dance!  It gives you a workout, whether you are looking for one or not!

Two things that stand out in this DVD: it is very reminiscent of old school aerobics - similar foot work in some cases - and, not surprisingly, since the instructor is a man, the moves are very masculine.  There are other materials out there that demonstrate more feminine bhangra dance moves - but regardless of that, I still love this DVD!",1264809600,3,815,4.472972972972973
8218572,5,B000VFIDT4,"Bhangra Beats is so much fun!  My 12 year old daughter likes it, too.  We can't keep up with Jay quite yet, but we have fun trying.",1254355200,,131,3.814814814814815
8218573,4,B000VFIDT4,"You have to get this DVD if you seriously want to learn the Bhangra moves accurately.  Not for beginners though, very intense workout, you WILL be sore if you don't do the warm ups AND cool-down (I speak from experience :D).  Also, you are better prepared for this DVD if you've been already dancing with other DVDs (or other form of long workouts) and you got your stamina up.

I personally started this workout after having done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quickfix-Cardio-Hip-Hop-Workout/dp/B00028G6EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quickfix - Cardio Hip-Hop Workout</a>&nbsp;for about a year.  This was good preparation for me.  Bhagra Beats is much more intense.  If initially the workout seem too much, you can lower the intensity or just do the default move and pick back up when you are rested. Just don't give up.  With time, as with me, you will build up some serious stamina!

I took one star off because of production.  I got spoiled with the glamorous, full-lighted studio recording with multiple cameras of the QuickFix video I mentioned.  Compared to that production, this seems a bit lacking.  Still, this contains solid, practical dance instruction material with awesome breakdown.  The DVD itself is very professionally laid out with sensible menus.

At a recent dance party with non-Indians, I had the opportunity to introduce some of these moves with Bhangra music.  There was a lot of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" as others danced along with me.  ""It was one of the best party I've ever been to"", one friend said.  That speaks a lot about this video and Bhangra dancing in general!

I have heard that Jay Patel is working on another video that will be out soon in this series.  Bring it on! Can't wait!! Ehhh...HA!  Haribba!",1250640000,3,1777,5.193661971830986
8218574,5,B000VFIDT4,awesome!  so glad I got this DVD.  this video covers the authentic bhangra you might see in competitions (check youtube).  lots of moves.  great price.  highly recommended.,1216684800,,172,5.222222222222222
8218575,5,B000VFIDT4,"Bhangra Beats is an amazing new workout that became and instant favorite in my household! My wife and I both do the workout individually and together and we're even beginning to get our 14 and 16 year old daughters into it. The host of the workout does an excellent job of teaching the user all the moves used throughout the workout and keeps the user very engaged throughout the workout with his high energy and clear instructions. The music that accompanies the workout is also very enjoyable!

I've tried other aerobic DVDs, but this one is my hands-down favorite! I couldn't say enough great things about this DVD and recommend it to anyone of all ages, sizes and experience levels!

Also, be sure to check out BhangraBeats.org for previews of the workout. Can't wait for Bhangra Beats: Round 2!",1216339200,7,799,4.741007194244604
8218576,3,B000VFIDT4,"I found bhangra music/dancing on a visit to India and was very excited to see it put into the form of a workout. The DVD is broken down into move training and two workouts.  I STRONGLY recommend taking the time to go through learning the moves before you start the workouts proper.  These are helpful and if you are not the type to quickly pick up on moves, you'd be lost very fast if you simply started the workouts.

My only complaint is that the camera often doesn't show the dancers' whole bodies, but just thighs and above. I would have rather had a total body view all the time, since footwork is the primary action in bhangra.",1207526400,12,633,4.3474576271186445
