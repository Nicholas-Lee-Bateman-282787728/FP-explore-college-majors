8688055,1,B00PHSOT7U,"I read a the description where it was stated that this was another character in the making that could be  as good as Tyler Perry's Madea. Please stop false advertising because anyone that is a Madea fan would know that this don't even come close. In fact don't try to compare this to any stage play. Yes, it was the worst I've seen yet. This was a horrible play (my opinion). Nothing but screaming and hollering and actors trying way too hard. I was embarrassed to share this dvd for the first time while going on a bus road trip. People weren't even interested. Please save your money for something else. It's too late to return and I can try to give it away or just trash it. Took way too long to even get to a good meaningful part.",1443571200,,734,4.242857142857143
