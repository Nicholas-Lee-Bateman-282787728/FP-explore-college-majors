Michael Jai White is just not a good actor -- I could have done better!!",1018396800,,214,4.195121951219512
1096358,5,6305954216,"I heard the description of this movie and I wasn't interested.  But this movie surprised me.  I certainly wasn't expecting a dark comedy that kept me laughing.  The cast did a wonderful job.  I especially loved the performances of Alec Baldwin and Michael Jai White.  (The two of them are so gorgeous, they are reason enough why any woman would love this film.)  I highly recommend this film.",1009497600,4,392,4.6911764705882355
1096359,4,6305954216,"This film has a good story, but you have to have a certain appreciation for warped humor to enjoy it.  The characters range from mildly unusual to downright peculiar.  Pointy (Michael Jai White) is a black crime boss who is trying desperately to be a yuppie, playing golf at the country club, owning a French restaurant and lecturing on culture to anyone who will listen.  All this is highly incongruous with the drug dealing, cap-busting realities of his crime syndicate, which makes him a droll and entertaining character.  Mackin (Alec Baldwin) is a meticulous thief, who does occasional heists for the Mafia.  He is an obsessive collector of vinyl jazz albums and takes his dog on capers because he wants to spend quality time with him.
When Mackin does a food stamp heist for Pointy, Pointy double-crosses him.  This sets up Mackin's revenge, which encompasses most of the film.  The vendetta keeps escalating and the Mafia starts losing patience with both antagonists, introducing a third element into the conflict.  The plot has a number of interesting twists and the climax is quite unexpected.
First time director Scott Sanders' direction was solid but nothing special.  The music, especially the jazz, was excellent.  His work with the cast was nicely done, adding a sardonic tone to the entire movie, although I thought at times he got carried away with the disjointed humor.
The acting was generally very good.  Alec Baldwin's quirky portrayal of this painstaking thief was delightful.  Rebecca De Mornay played a very different character than we are used to seeing from her.  She was terrific as the tough and impassive cop with an understated and sarcastic wit.  However, the best performances were given by Michael Jai White and Andre Braugher.  White stole the show with his oh-so-refined mob boss impression.  Braugher was great as his cool and calculating lieutenant, with nerves of steel and a brilliant criminal mind.
Overall, this was a good crime story that meandered a bit too much from the main plot.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you like wry incongruous humor because this film has plenty.",970185600,10,2121,4.943502824858757
1096360,2,6305954216,"Alec Baldwin is a dynamic actor who for reasons inexplicable to me cannot seem to land a popular role, and, lately, *is* managing to land an increasing number of dogs.  ""Thick as Thieves"" is one of them.
Baldwin plays a career criminal with a dog named Wally.  For some  reason, the story begins ""Sometime in the 1980's"" with his  showing up in town after a 2-month absense, tricking his erstwhile  girlfriend into leaving the house, and taking some money he had stashed  there...and the woman's dog.  Of course, we expect this maneuver--the  trickery, the money--to have something to do with what happens in  ""Chicago, 14 Years Later..."", but it doesn't.  This introductory  material is there only to show us how he got the dog, whom he loves dearly,  and which relationship is played up throughout the movie in an overly  cutsie manner that becomes really annoying.  This is a problem throughout  the movie...we are repeatedly diverted by these ""cute""  moments.
This is the sort of movie that tries to make its characters  lively by forcing upon them improbable dialogue and cleverness that ill-fit  the kind of hoods we're dealing with.  Sometimes it's amusing.  Mostly,  it's just mannered. It draws attention to itself in a way that makes for  overall uneveness...in the 1970's, a reviewer might have said that the  humor wasn't ""organic,"" and the datedness of the remark  notwithstanding, he'd have been right.
The actors are fine.  For me, Alec  Baldwin is always a pleasure to watch.  I'm looking forward to his getting  more roles like ""Junior"" in *Miami Blues*, or the salesman in  Glengarry Glen Ross.
This movie does have some good moments, some  believable moments. And the detours...really, they're very brief.  But  there are simply too many.  The sum of this movie is less than the parts.",964742400,,1804,4.926421404682274

1096547,4,6305954216,"Well acted, written and directed little film.  Alec Baldwin is excellent as a professional thief, double-crossed and set up by a gang leader after pulling a heist.  An important subplot deals with Baldwin's character's love for his dying dog that he cannot let go and the role it plays in the larger events of the story.  Well worth looking at!",1402272000,,344,4.7

1096690,4,6305954216,"As usual, Alec Baldwin was perfect in his role. This is a good mystery and will keep you watching till the very end. Alec Baldwin does play a different role that what he usually plays but since he is a very versatile actor he really gets into his role. I would recommend this to anyone that loves a mystery.

A great supporting cast Baldwin at the top of his game, I just loved it!",1342828800,,373,4.054054054054054
1096695,5,6305954216,"A favorite.

Tells the story of professional thief Mackin, played by Alec Baldwin with his usual simmering volcanic brilliance. An associate of one of the crime families, he's been asked to do a fairly simple boost: Help a Detroit thug snatch several million dollars worth of negotiable food stamps. If he doesn't like the set-up he can walk away. If he does the job - he scores a nice payday and the continuing friendship of the mob.

Problem is that the Motor City connection is a devilish funny moron by the name of 'Pointy' Williams, a ghetto thug who has a hilariously warped desire to recast himself as a high society gentleman. But just like many from the upper crust - he doesn't like paying for services rendered. To avoid a $25K payout to the thief, the plan calls for Mackin's death upon completion of the heist, and simultaneously making a much needed payoff to a pair of dirty cops he's using as hitmen.

Not a good idea.

As the hit goes awry, a bloodied and seriously pissed off Mackin decides on retribution plus heavy duty interest. Notoriously, street hoods only rarely accept their mistakes with grace and maturity, and the knuckleheaded versions never walk away. So a war is unleashed; the destruction and blood begins to flow as each side ups the ante until it threatens to engulf everyone and everything.

Despite my description - this is an amusing and entertaining comedy. Admittedly, a very dark comedy, but one that I find particularly ticklish to the funny bone.

Personal Notes:

- Long an underrated actor. Alec is probably one of the best artists around that hasn't accrued nearly the acclaim equal to his talent. Admittedly, he's one of his own worst enemies; the infamous Irish temper often getting the better of him. A reflection that, like the many conflicted characters he portrays, exposes the person underneath isn't too far removed from the roles which he undertakes.

- Generally enjoy Michael Jai White's performances, but in this hilarious role I take particular joy. It takes real skill and genuine talent to play stupid. Not a joke. Almost every single actor has ""diminished capacity"" in their repertoire; it's really not that difficult to play disabled. But very few have 'moron' as a skill, not unless they actually are - like Paris Hilton.

- Probably one of the best, most complete characters, Rebecca De Mornay has done since her breakout role in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Risky-Business/dp/B0018QPPXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Risky Business</a>'. Extraordinarily talented, but unfortunately I think she missed her chance at the brass ring. Still, that's what I thought of Melissa Leo, and she eventually won an Oscar. So...

- As a huge fan of jazz, and to a lesser extent bossa nova, loved the soundtrack to this stylish flick.",1338681600,,2824,5.053763440860215

I myself always rue running across it on cable (for awhile, HBO was running it constantly as late-night filler) as I will end up watching at least 20 minutes. Every single role is cast to perfection, especially the smaller ones. But it's the dialogue that truly makes the film. It's a shame there aren't any other Patrick Quinn novels out there to adapt as well as Scott Sanders did with this film.",1250985600,3,644,4.551724137931035

1096780,5,6305954216,"I've never seen a movie with dialog so tight it seems like the loss of even one word could ruin the entire film.  The plot, though simple, feels almost as carefully shaved as the dialog. (One scene always bugs me though: the size of Mackin's pre-eBay jazz LP collection makes it impossible to believe he never met this record store owner before now.) Other than my stupidity over that one scene, I love every other second of this movie.

If you enjoy Dave Barry, Hunter Thompson, Barry Sonnenfeld, Get Shorty, Snatch, Big Trouble, Dave Attell, Lewis Black, Donnie Darko, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Last Supper, then you are sick! And will probably enjoy this warped movie.",1145923200,12,681,4.714285714285714

1096784,4,6305954216,"This independent film is a delightful dark comedy. The film stars Alec Baldwin as a professional theif with a subtle tough-guy demeanor and a love of vinyl jazz. Baldwin combines his dry wit, his myriad of facial expressions, and his trademark .45 auto into a thoroughly interesting character. Michael Jai White comes in as a reniassance hoodlum and Rebecca DeMornay is way out of type as a not particularly attractive cop. All of these actors plus a great performance by talented character actor Andre Braugher will keep you chuckling through the whole film. Keep in mind this film is a showcase of acting ability and not a testament to big pecs or explosions, but as smaller budget independent films go this one is on the A-list.",1044230400,32,731,4.809523809523809
