2354835,5,B000A345EO,"I bought this for my 18-mo-old son prior to a long road trip & he was mesmerized by all of the DVDs. They are a good mix of past & present Sesame Street, with appearances from Mr. Hooper & other characters from the early years in one of them.

I especially like how one of the DVDs gives a synopsis of how different people celebrate the holidays, including stories of Christmas, Hannukah & Kwanza. It's a great way to teach your children about diversity & the unique ways people celebrate within their own cultures.",1133308800,14,515,4.4787234042553195

2354868,4,B000A345EO,"My son really enjoyed two of the three dvds. The Christmas Eve episode is a little slow and dated. He really enjoys the newer episodes where there is a lot of music involved. We ordered a separate dvd, Elmo's Christmas Countdown, and my son liked it better than all three of these ones.",1397606400,,286,4.415094339622642
2354869,5,B000A345EO,"This is a great dvd collection for Sesame Street lovers. All throughout the holiday season, my son (age 1) watched these DVDs over and over. The oldest Sesame special ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"" is the best--wonderful music! However, my son also enjoyed ""Elmo Saves Christmas."" He didn't watch the other one as much. I strongly recommend this for 1-2 years old. So cute! The ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"" was even nostalgic for me and my husband. You can't go wrong with this set.",1391385600,2,488,4.752941176470588

2354891,5,B000A345EO,Sesame Street is an all time favorite with every child. This movie has couple different Christmas episodes on it. Our favorite is with Oscar the Grouch.,1375920000,,152,4.884615384615385
2354892,4,B000A345EO,"I have not seen it myself, but I can only assume it's awesome. I loved Christmas Eve on Sesame Street when I was a kid, and our daycare provider seemed very happy to receive this set for the holidays.",1360540800,,200,4.153846153846154
2354893,5,B000A345EO,What a great collection of DVD's.  My 2 year old watched these over and over in December.  I'm sure we will still be watching them in July too.,1359936000,,143,4.071428571428571

2354895,5,B000A345EO,"A GREAT CHRISTMAS COMBO. CHRISTMAS EVE ON SESAME IS THE MOST SUBLIME OF CHRISTMAS
MOVIES. THE SONG ""BLUE MIRACLE"" IS SO BEAUTIFUL IT SHOULD BE ON BILLBOARD 100.",1358121600,,160,4.75
2354896,5,B000A345EO,"It came in about 5 days in a nice packaging. My daughter loved this, the only one she did not like was the last disc witch has no Elmo in it due to it being from a special before Elmo. Other than that she loves it so much she is about 16 months and just loves Elmo.",1355443200,,265,3.6666666666666665
2354897,2,B000A345EO,"I am not pleased with the purchase of these Cds, two of the cds are not playable they freeze. I have cleaned them and still they freeze in the same areas. I guess the price was too good to be true. My fault on that one.",1323648000,,219,3.782608695652174
2354898,4,B000A345EO,"The shows are very good.  I hadn't seen Sesame Street Christmas Eve in decades.  I wanted to bring it into my children's lives.

What I found interesting was I paid one amount for the DVD collection and upon receipt, the DVD in the Amazon box had a price tag on it for $6 less than I paid via Amazon.  Really?",1322179200,,309,4.1
2354899,5,B000A345EO,"Happy Holidays From Sesame Street is a must have if you have small children in the house.  In fact, even my ""big kids"" who grew up watching Sesame Street still love to watch Chrismas Eve on Sesame Street every year, it has become a tradition.  Now my grandchildren love to watch all the action from Sesame Street and these Christmas CD's have been a hit at grandma's house this year.",1261180800,,383,4.457142857142857
2354900,5,B000A345EO,"I highly recommend this collection for Elmo lovers.  Both my girls love(d) Elmo and he is at his best in 2 of these DVDs.  The third ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"" is a treat for me!  Sesame Street is as I remember it.  Brings back memories of my childhood.  Naturally the DVDs fell into little hands and my favorite one was broken.  I ordered a replacement to have my full set again.  I have pulled this DVD collection out for probably 3 years in a row and I have gotten my money's worth for sure!",1260316800,,500,4.2
2354939,5,B000A345EO,"This collection is really great. We recently moved and I lost my old VHS copy of Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, so we bought this collection to replace it. I usually find Elmo a tad annoying, but he's really cute in these ""movies.""",1255305600,5,232,4.4186046511627906

2354941,5,B000A345EO,"These collection of three Sesame Street classics is a great deal, not only because all three DVD's are great, but because each is an hour long.  The DVD's include ""Elmo's World: Happy Holidays,"" which teaches about holidays around the world and exposes kids to different traditions and customs, ""Elmo Saves Christmas,"" which shows what the world would be like if Christmas was everyday, and the Sesame Street classic, ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"" with all the memorable songs such as ""Keep Christmas With You,"" ""I Hate Christmas,"" and the wonderful ""I Believe in Miracles"".

These titles will appeal not only to kids, but are also fun for grownups to watch.  It adds to the holiday spirit to have some Christmas DVD's that you only bring out that time of year.  Two thumbs up for this collection!",1228348800,8,800,4.860294117647059

2354944,3,B000A345EO,"My kids LOVE Elmo's World and Sesame Street.  The Elmo Saves Christmas was a little over my 2 & 3 year olds heads and the Christmas Eve on Sesame Street was an oldie that I remember as a kid, but my kids didn't care for it either.  They did enjoy the Elmo's World Holiday DVD though...",1198886400,,285,4.071428571428571

2354946,4,B000A345EO,"Three Sesame street movies.  No redundancy between the movies.  One is a nice old school movie and the other two involve Elmo.  One being an Elmo movie and one being a giant Holiday themed ""Elmo's world"".  They did a good job of trying to make kids aware of other cultures and how they celebrate Christmas.  For us, it was a nice alternative to our kids wanting to watch cartoons and it got them into the spirit of the holidays.",1169078400,,428,4.367088607594937
