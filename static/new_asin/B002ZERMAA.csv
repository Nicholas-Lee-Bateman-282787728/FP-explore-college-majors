8482265,3,B002ZERMAA,"AUDIO- 4/5, GOOD AUDIO JUST DIDN'T MATCH THE MOUTHS OF THAT ACTORS PERFECTLY.
VIDEO QUALITY- 4/5 SOME GREAT SHOTS WERE TAKEN, THE HD ISN'T BLUE-RAY BUT IT LOOKS DECENTLY PROFESSIONAL.
STORY- 3/5 I CANNOT TIE IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN END THIS MAY CHANGE IF SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN IT BETTER.
ACTORS-2/5 THERE ALL AMATEUR ACTORS AND DID A DECENT JOB BUT THE HOLY PRIEST WAS WAY OVER THE TOP AND UNBELIEVABLE WITH THE OVER POWERING VOICE AND CORNY DIALECT IT TOOK FROM THE REALISM.
KILLS- 3/4 SOME LOOKED COOL! TIM BUNCH'S DEATH WAS VERY CREATIVE AND HAVE A TRUE MOVIE FEEL WHICH I THOUGH WAS AWESOME! OTHERS WERE OVER THE TOP AND THE BLOOD LOOKED LIKED MAPLE SYRUP.
OVERALL- WAS A GOOD OVERALL MOVIE FOR A LOCAL FAN OF HAUNTED HOUSES! IF NOT LOCAL AND LIKED TO SEE HOME TRADEMARKS SUCH AS DOWNTOWN BUFFALO AND THE GARDEN VILLAGE PLAZA I'D LET THIS ONE GO. BUT IF YOUR IN THE MOOD FOR A LOCAL HORROR SHOW IT'S NOT TOO BAD!",1311897600,,916,4.42603550295858
8482266,5,B002ZERMAA,"A visually stunning and frightening independent film from Buffalo New York.
This movie certainly has a ""Hollywood"" look to it and the cinematography is very well done. Religious folk beware: the plot of the film revolves not only around the ""House Of Horrors"" Haunted House, but also delves into mindset of modern day Christianity in a less than favorable light. This sub plot only adds to the depth of this well thought out horror film... a must see for any and all slasher fans.",1262995200,,480,4.726190476190476
8482267,5,B002ZERMAA,This film is wonderful.  Great cinematography and special effects and the acting is great. Filmed in Buffalo and all local people in it.  You will never believe it was a low budget film after watching it.  Dan Monroe does a wonderful job of telling a story with suspense and not too much gore.  The editing was great and kept you on the edge of your seat.  His ability to change the direction of the film keeps your emotions on edge the whole time.  There are some disturbing scenes that true horror film buffs will love.  This film deserves attention!!,1259884800,,553,4.525252525252525
