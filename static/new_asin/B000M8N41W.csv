2726861,5,B000M8N41W,"I have been waiting for this set for years,  and finally my prayers have been answered.  SatAM with many extras comes to DVD at last, I know DICs partnership with Shout Factory would help this, I was hoping it would be a good thing for this and thank god it was.  And best of all for me, MY ARTWORK IS GOING TO BE ON THE PACKAGING!  I left my mark on Mario but now I leave my mark on Sonic as well, I am part of DVD history.

But to the point.  Sonic the Hedgehog is a series with more of a plot then the other series have mainly had.  It takes place on the planet Mobius with Sonic and his fellow freedom fighters Rotor, Antoine, Bunnie Rabbot, and Sally Acorn trying to stop the evil Dr. Robotnik who has taken over the planet.

This would have had another season but Power Rangers got in the way and prevented it from happening.  But I promise you, this is one Sonic series that does not disappoint.  For any Sonic fan young and old, I would buy and enjoy this DVD set, it's one of the best Sonic shows ever made.

Watching it now, it angers me more that it was cancelled.  This show is WAY above Sonic X, and the best of all DIC Sonic Series.

I have check the special features, not bad, the Jaleel convo was nice as was the prototype opener (I like the finished opener better).  There are a few things I have not checked out just yet though so I can not comment them just yet.

The best thing for me to see will be Season 2, I missed a lot of that but I saw low def versions online but they were edited, to finally have them uncut with the opener, credits and such will be is awesome.

Another cool thing about this set is that the pilot episode is airing first instead of last in Season 1 for once.

Looks like the perfect DVD set for any oldschool Sonic fan and a Must have for any Sonic fan.",1169251200,,1799,4.036723163841808
2726862,5,B000M8N41W,"A long time ago, when I was little, I saw a few episodes of this show. At the time, I felt it was too ""kiddy"", so I avoided watching it. Since then, I've seen the websites devoted entirely to it's memory, and they've definetly had an effect on me. Seeing the devotion so many people pay to this show, I must say I regret the childish attitude I had when I was a little. This show has made a lasting impression on everyone who saw it for what it was, a mature show made for everyone about a near hopeless struggle to take back paradise from a madman.

I urge you to see this show, and experience what I once missed out on.",1169078400,2,621,4.048780487804878
2726863,5,B000M8N41W,"Way way back in '93 when this cartoon came out, I remember always getting up to watch it. As a kid, I loved the heck out of Sonic, and this cartoon to me was the best story for him. I've played all the games, as well as all the recent ones, but the SatAm Sonic had the best storyline of them all.

 The character are so memorable, this this day I still remember them. I am still a collector of the comic books from way back then as well.

 The story is pretty dark compared to all other Sonic stories, and Sonic himself is pretty funny. They surely did capture his attitude and feel of how the Sonic character would have been and is. Jaleel White did an awesome job as Sonic's voice and I couldn't think of anyone else that could do better.

 If anyone out there remembers this cartoon, and is a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan this is a definite must have for you.",1168214400,5,861,4.125748502994012
2726864,5,B000M8N41W,"I grew up watching this cartoon, and it blew me away!  The storylines, the plot, everything was what made this cartoon the best Sonic cartoon out there!",1167955200,,152,4.62962962962963
2726865,5,B000M8N41W,"This the reason why I became a Sonic fan myself too. Story was very interesting and i got really hook on to it. lol 11 years man now its finally on DVD. fan or not you will like the series if its in your taste.

For the comics in my oponion was alittle off the edge but it still kept the same characters i know from SatAM and they started to add some more even the ones from the video games with there own background. Well that is all I'm going to say. I'm just happy to see its going to be on DVD and i will see all the episodes i miss on there. happy new years all",1167696000,3,566,3.7563025210084033
2726866,5,B000M8N41W,"While I can't claim to own the DVD set at this point, I have seen the entire ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" series multiple times and can say that there has never been anything quite like it before or since in children's animation.  The concept-- a show based around a commercial video game character-- is one that seemed doomed to mediocrity, yet ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" was anything but mediocre.  Like Mike Reyes below me said, this series was the first to develop the character of Sega's blue mascot and delve into the backstory of the franchise.  This is the Sonic that many children of the 80's and 90's fondly remember.  It was the basis for the American Sonic story seen in the Archie comic series and subsequent American game translations up until Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast.

The 1993-1995 series, better known as ""SatAM"" to many of its fans, was born out of a 'renaissance' period of traditional children's animation in the early 90's.  It boasted a developed storyline, all-star voice acting cast, and some of the biggest writers, artists, and producers in the industry at the time.

Many Sonic fans have waited 11 years to see this series finally make its way to DVD, and the release itself has shaped up to be quite a package.  I am the webmaster of the fan site saturdaymorningsonic.com, and can say that Shout! Factory has consulted fans of the series every step of the way in the production of this box set.  From storyboards and interviews with writer Ben Hurst and VA Jaleel White, to the inclusion of fan art and a sweet cover to boot, this box set is going to be one for the collector's shelf.  Don't pass this one up!",1167523200,7,1628,4.621527777777778
2726867,5,B000M8N41W,"Finally, the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon that aired on ABC in 1993-1994 (known as ""Sonic SatAM"" to the fans) comes to DVD in its entirety. Many of those who managed to catch the show on TV well over 10 years ago fell in love with it then, and have been fans ever since. It had just the right blend of comedy, drama, and action, with no one of those standing out too much above the others.  It was also a fairly dark show for its time.  This is a much anticipated release in the Sonic fan community, and this DVD set contains all 26 episodes, collecting the complete series in one 4-disc set!

This cartoon was made back before the SegaSonic storyline really got developed, and you won't be seeing familiar faces like Knuckles, Amy Rose, or the more recent characters from Sonic Adventure 2, Shadow and Rouge, simply because, well, none of them existed back then (Sonic 3, which was Knuckles' first game, didn't even come out until the year after it started airing). But that doesn't detract from the show at all as there are plenty of well developed characters added here that weren't from the games. This cartoon set-up the first real storyline behind the whole Sonic universe (in the U.S. anyway), and in my opinion, was one of the best American made cartoons ever. The Archie series of Sonic the Hedgehog comics was loosely based on this cartoon, but really failed to capture the quality of writing used to produce this show.  (Archie has since moved on to try to emulate the games more).

Despite the age of this show, if you're a Sonic fan, you definitely shouldn't pass this one up. Definitely the best Sonic cartoon ever produced, in my opinion, as well as one of the greatest cartoons of all time. I'd give it more than 5 stars, but well.. that's the most you can give here on Amazon.com :)",1167436800,42,1797,4.5

2726870,5,B000M8N41W,"This was one excellent series. To have it all together is just awesome. A feature that I found to be a nice touch was the fan art they used for the DVD cases, inside art and DVD art. This version of Sonic is darker than the rest, more adult but not overly so. It's something for all ages, a difficult balance to make but one they pulled off nicely.",1422835200,,348,4.057971014492754

2726872,5,B000M8N41W,"The original ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" cartoon (also known as SatAM) is a cult classic, a dark sci-fi adventure series with wonderful characters, art, and music. Its only real flaws are some plot holes in the second season, and the fact that it's radically different from the game series it supposedly is an adaptation of. I would recommend it to fans of 90s animation, fans of the Archie Sonic the Hedgehog comic, and any other Sonic fans who don't mind when adaptations depart from the game canon.

This collection has the entire series, plus a number of fascinating behind-the-scenes extras; I recommend it over the dvd collections that have only a few episodes each.",1409616000,,665,4.884955752212389

He loves the show, and I think Sonic has officially usurped Spongebob as his TV preference. Sad that there are only 26 episodes, but for a little boy that loves Sonic, it seems to be more than enough. You know how kids are. They can watch the same 2 hour movie 6 times in a row ;). I have fond memories of this show from when I was a boy, and I still enjoyed watching it with him. It has an air of quality about it that just doesn't show up in modern kids cartoons that much.",1371427200,,581,3.9322033898305087
2726882,5,B000M8N41W,"Sonic has always been my favorite videogame character, partially because he has the best life outside of videogames.  I loved the Adventures of Sonic cartoon first, because I was little & the silliness appealed to me.  But that quickly changed when I saw this show one Saturday morning.  I mean, I was confused at first because it was so different, but by the end of the opening I was into it.  When I finished watching Sonic's Nightmare, I realized this was the most awesome Sonic cartoon ever.  The new characters were a little weird to me at first, but they really grew on me.  And even back then I could have told you the animation looked better.  When I discovered the comics based on the show, I was even happier.  My first issue was the Mecha Madness special, which incidentally is when the series got really good.  Before then, the first 20 something issues were basically the serious characters in rejected plots from the funny show, which were terrible for the most part.  But around issue 25 or so, it got good & while it still had some silly main stories, there were always good back-up stories.  The comic continues to this day, & every month for the past 10 years I go to my local comic store & get the latest Sonic.  I have everything after 100, & a lot of the good issues that came before, but not all (incidentally, it's incredibly hard to find back issues for that time).  I think it says something that I had all the VHS tapes for the goofy show, but only 1 for this one (the one with Sonic Racer & Sonic Boom).  I got rid of all my AoStH tapes later, but kept the good one until my VCR chewed it up.  I got this DVD the day it came out, & have watched it over & over since then.  This show always rocks.  Even though it's darker than the other one, there's still some funny moments, thanks to good comic relief characters like Antoine & Snively.  By the way, the package design is one the best I've ever seen for a DVD set.  The use of fan art is just a wonderful touch, although the covers for the discs should have been switched.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1.  Heads or Tails:  Princess Sally sends Sonic to Robotropolis in search of materials to build a defense against an impending invasion by Robotnik.  She doesn't know that the inexperienced Tails is tagging along...  This is like a plot from the early comics, & that's not a good thing.  C

2.  Sonic Boom:  Princess Sally follows up on a lead that suggests that her father, King Maximillian, may be alive.  This is the real pilot, & it is an excellent first episode.  It's actually one of the greatest single part first episodes I've ever seen of any show.  Of the 6 episodes released on 3 VHS tapes, this one was always my favorite.  I mean this is the episode I would recommend the most to first time viewers.  A+

3.  Sonic & Sally:  When the Princess is captured, Robotnik creates a robotic duplicate of her as a means of spying on and sabotaging the Freedom Fighters.  When Tails suspects something is wrong, will Sonic believe him?  My other favorite of the episodes I watched on VHS.  It's easy to see why the writers for this one got to write all of season 2.  A+

4.  Ultra Sonic:  Sonic finds his long lost uncle, Sir Charles, after a failed mission in Robotropolis, kicking off an emotional roller coaster ride for him.  Seeing this episode on TV was one of the most vivid memories I have of any show I watched as a kid.  A+

5.  Sonic & the Secret Scrolls:  The Freedom Fighters embark on an outlandish mission: to find magical scrolls which may hold the key to unlimited power.  A very adventurous episode.  A+

6.  Super Sonic:  Robotnik searches for a computer archive of spells belonging to an ancient evil wizard. Sonic heads to Robotropolis to get the crystal before Robotnik can use it.  But soon he is stripped of his legendary speed: can he get to the crystal in time?  This is an excellent focus on Sonic.  A+

7.  Sonic Racer:  Robotnik holds a race in Robotropolis in a bid to lure Sonic into a trap. The other Freedom Fighters take advantage of Robotnik's fixation on the race in hopes of destroying the city's power generator.  Another old favorite of mine.  The plot's great, & it has some hilarious moments.  A+

8.  Harmonic Sonic:  Robotnik launches a spy satellite in an effort to locate Knothole Village, the Freedom Fighters' hidden base. Sonic and Rotor head towards the satellite using a makeshift rocket to destroy it.  Not the best, but not bad.  B+

9.  Hooked on Sonics:  Antoine goes after Robotnik himself in an insane bid to impress Sally and earn personal glory.  Will he get out alive?  An excellent focus on Antoine.  A+

10.  Sonic's Nightmare:  Sonic is paralysed by a recurring nightmare personifying his own personal fears; meanwhile, Robotnik unleashes a machine that can literally destroy the world.  The first episode I ever saw, & it's one of the best.  A+

11.  Warp Sonic:  The Freedom Fighters find themselves defending an underground city of Mobian refugees... all the while coming to terms with their own personal relationships.  A pretty good episode.  A-

12.  Sub-Sonic:  The Freedom Fighters home, the Great Forest, is dying. In search of magical water that causes plants to grow at an accelerated speed, the Freedom Fighters journey underground.  The better of the 2 episodes to focus on Rotor.  A+

13.  Sonic Past Cool:  Robotnik has set his greedy eyes on the last living herd of a dinosaur-like species.  The Freedom Fighters help the creatures navigate through the Great Jungle while fighting off the advances of Robotnik's machines.  My second least favorite episode of the season, but it's not bad.  B

14.  Game Guy:  Sonic and Sally befriend an ally who claims to be part of another Freedom Fighter group, but he is not what he seems to be.  An excellent start to the second season.  A+

15.  Sonic Conversion:  Knothole's De-roboticizer is a success! Bunnie Rabbot and Uncle Chuck are back to their normal selves! But is the Freedom Fighters' latest accomplishment too good to be true?  Another excellent episode, marred only by a breaking of the fourth wall at the end.  A

16.  No Brainer:  When Sonic loses his memory by a device Robotnik invented, Snively takes advantage and gets the hedgehog to infiltrate Knothole.  Can the Freedom Fighters return Sonic's memory to him before he betrays them?  By far the best use of the amnesia plot in an action cartoon, since it's done on purpose & makes for a very good weapon.  A

17-18.  Blast From the Past:  The war with Robotnik goes badly.  The only hope may lie in a pair of magical Time Stones: using them Sonic and Sally could travel to Mobotropolis Kingdom's past, prior to Robotnik's takeover and stop the fight before it begins!  The only 2-part story this show did is one of its best.  A+

19a.  Fed Up with Antoine: Antoine is appointed king of a biker gang, unaware of their ""cannibalistic"" tradition.  The first of the comedic half-episodes, & it's actually pretty funny.  B+

19b.  Ghost Busted:  Sonic and Tails investigate a possible ghost problem while camping out.  My least favorite of the comedic episodes, but it's not bad.  B

20.  Dulcy:  Dulcy is summoned to a dragon mating ground as Robotnik seeks to roboticize the remainder of her species.  I love Dulcy, so it was great that she got an episode to call her own.  A+

21.  The Void:  When Sally and Bunnie disappear, Sonic and Nicole rush in to rescue them, entering the Void.  But getting into the Void, is much easier than getting out.  My least favorite of the 5 Doomsday Project episodes, but it's still above average.  A-

22a.  The Odd Couple:  Antoine is forced to share his house with Sonic after a failed landing from Dulcy destroys the hedgehog's home.  My favorite of the comedy episodes.  It makes me laugh quite a lot.  A

22b.  Ro-Becca:  Antoine accidentally activates a robot Rotor was working on. The robot suddenly develops a crush on him.  My second favorite comedy episode.  I honestly do get some real laughs out of this one.  A-

23.  Cry of the Wolf:  Sonic and company finally make contact with another Royal Freedom Fighter group. They must work together when a nearly indestructible war-machine arrives to attack.  The Wolf Pack has some of the best characters in all of Sonic.  A+

24.  Drood Henge:  Sonic and Tails team up in order to thwart Robotnik's scheme to possess the magical Deep Power Stones.  Tails' best episode.  A+

25.  Spy Hog:  Uncle Chuck finds himself increasingly at risk operating as a spy in Robotropolis.  A really good penultimate episode.  A+

26.  The Doomsday Projecy:  Robotnik's Doomsday Project begins a week early than anyone had anticipated.  With all of Mobius in danger, the Freedom Fighters prepare for what may be their final battle.  The best episode of the whole series.  A+

It's a shame this show was cancelled so soon.  would have been awesome!  But, with a little editing here & there, it's not hard to imagine the story continuing in the comics.  I would still love to see a continuation with the original voice actors though (as long as they don't rename Robotnik Eggman).  I mean, the Biker Mice From Mars got a sequel series recently with the original voice actors.  That was a great show & was glad to see it return, but I would like to see Sonic & SWAT Kats return even more.  I recommend this to all Sonic Fans.",1368748800,,9406,4.570307785153893

The special features are contain all the big questions to the making of this sonic cartoon with his voice actor and the creator.

Its animation is well put together, also it has a top notching story and there is also 2 episodes containing a back story to this show which really amazed me a whole alot to show you where it all began. Most of the characters are from the archies comics but they done a really good job with adding them into the show which makes it even more cool or should i say way past cool! I can point out way this show was cancelled in a year and a few months was because it was too dark for kids but that doesn't mean this show is bad because it isn't with it's clever storyline,awesome atmosphere,great voice acting and its sonic the hedgehog.

He was my favorite character as a little boy, I constantly ran around the house in my Sonic slippers trying to run as fast as he did! Sonic even inspired me to own two hedgehogs of my own. The video games are classic, of course, and the original show was pretty good too. I've watched both series and in my opinion this particular Sonic series is my favorite. It's a little darker than other Sonic shows or games. PLUS! Jaleel White (Steve Urkel) does the voice for the super speedy blue hero, so that in itself is worth it (if you watched Family Matters that is). I would recommend this series to any Sonic the Hedgehog fan and especially to any young parents out there that want something that isn't so completely unbearable to watch WITH your children. If not, it's worth the buy simply because these kinds of shows are going to be gone in a few years and we'll be left with nothing but crap.

complaints of a paranoid remnant of Dr. Fredric Wertham's followers, whom are better
known as modern Americans. These first episodes were dedicated to telling a story
rather than entertaining children and selling food stuffs. They were no darker in tone
than fairy tales, or star wars and did not talk down to their audience, but instead
recognized that children are people as well and deserve to have their minds broadened
by what they see and hear and not stifled by our ideas of what children should be or
become. I applaud this first season and hope that more animators in both the present
and the future can be equally as strait forward about their stories.

That being said,

the second season was frankly a disaster; it became an example of censorship gone awry.
The series' creators were forced by the studios to give their creation a pastel
whitewash and eliminate anything that could potentially offend anyone in general. The
character ""Sally"", for instance, was made to wear a blue vest, for there had been a
complaint that an animated animal without clothing was far too risque to be seen by a
child. ""Robotnik"" was changed from semi-competent villain to antagonist more reminiscent
of a Walt Disney motion-picture. These changes, along with many others, were very
disheartening and I remember the day of the second season's premier as the day I learned
the saying: Only as Strong as the Weakest Link.

All in all, this is a worthwhile collection and should be both treasured and adored.",1323907200,4,1830,4.858974358974359

After seeing a review for this I had the urge to pick it up and am quite pleased with the purchase, One of the better animated shows of it's time, mixed with elements of light and dark and a fun story that's worth watching.",1309478400,,371,4.166666666666667
2726903,5,B000M8N41W,"When SatAM (because the show debuted on Saturday mornings) was first shown on television, I was a bit young to know exactly what was going on.  Today though, I've heard the story enough to know what happened.  SatAM originally competed with the power rangers, and one show won, and the other (SatAM) was canceled.

SatAM is THE Sonic show that didn't talk down to its audience.  The longtime villain of the games, Doctor Robotnik, has basically won in his bid for world conquest: he already rules the world when you start watching, and Sonic the Hedgehog with his band of freedom fighters now fight against the tyrant to take back their home world.  The story and plot is very nicely summed up in the memorable opening title sequence, complete with catchy theme song.

Unlike the more well-known Sonic cartoon (which just tries to come off as goofy) or Sonic Underground (which has Sonic moon-lighting in a family rock band), this is a much darker, action oriented show, with a serious setting.  Sonic is essentially fighting a war using guerrilla tactics while maintaining his 90's era ""way-past-cool"" attitude.  The enemy, Doctor Robotnik, literally traps any animals that inhabit Sonic's world, and turns them into his robot slaves, stripping them of their free-will and identity.  In addition, he lives in a very polluted machine city, while Sonic and friends fight from their secret hideout within a nearby forest, giving the show an ecological message)  In a way, this makes the show the closest yet to the games... but the similarities stop there.

To start, the story and characters are lifted straight out of (but not part of) the Sonic comics published by Archie, with the viewer left to familiarize themselves with a brand new cast of side characters (including Robotnik's nephew, Snively, Sonic's uncle Chuck, and the dethroned Princess Sally) as they watch... which isn't hard, but the complete lack of recognizability from the get-go may turn some off.  And while power rings make an appearance, Chaos Emeralds and Super Sonic (and Knuckles... he's in Sonic Underground) do not.

There's also the matter of the ending: thankfully, we are lucky to have some sort of a proper ending for a canceled television cartoon, but it also ends on a very obvious cliff hanger, indicating that there were many plans for the show that we never got to see to fruition.

SatAM was no doubt a great television show, but today it may take the right kind of person to see the value in it.  If you're a fan of the comics already (and have perhaps been reading the ""Sonic Archives"" series of graphic novel reprints), but haven't seen it, you'll probably find it very enjoyable.  Anyone who enjoys collecting these old cartoon shows would also probably be able to see the show for how good it really is.  But if you're just a Sonic fan, who's going to be upset or let down when when you see a lot of unfamiliar characters... you should think twice, and maybe go buy that other ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" show... you know... the goofy one.",1308441600,4,3038,4.800383877159309
2726904,5,B000M8N41W,"This is an excellent product. I grew up watching this show, and I am more than happy to have it on my shelf. Recommended for any fan of the Blue Blur.",1308096000,,150,3.870967741935484
2726905,5,B000M8N41W,"I have been a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog TV show since I was a young kid, but unfortunately, I only was able to see a few episodes here and there, and never saw any reruns. I was hooked on the show though, and always yearned to watch more of it. Growing up and using the new dang fangled world wide web on my 56K Modem (that ran less than 3KB a second maximun, ugh) I downloaded horrible bootlegs that were less than 7 megs a pop. The only real thing that kept my interest in the Sonic the Hedgehog SatAM series was the VHS tape my Mom bought me and the Archie comics. It actually kept me going for a long while.

Well, due to growing up and managing a busy life, especially in this day and age, I stumbled upon this set on Amazon. I knew of its existence for awhile, but repeatably delayed a purchase because I needed to save my funds, however small amounts I would save even from buying this. However, thanks to a significant other who loves Sonic as much as I do, she surprised me with purchasing this DVD box set for me (us, haha), and boy, was it like throwing a decade of growing up behind me and going back to my childhood. In other words, this set is amazing.

The first thing you'll notice is the exterior of the box. Drawn by one of the original artists of the show, you can't help but feel the quality of the set and a rush of nostalgia. Opening the box really shows the effort the company made with this set however. Fan artwork galore! Although not all of it is ""excellent art"", you can see how much the fans love Sonic. The DVDs even have artwork on them. Overall, the design is flawless in execution.

The DVD menus have a really nice flare to them. It's something you'll just have to see for yourself, but it was a nice surprise, and you can see the extra effort they put into the DVDs. In terms of extras, it may not be much, but it's just enough to go crazy about! There are two major interviews, one with the voice of Sonic, the other, one of the original creators who designed the story for Sonic. He talked about the direction Sonic would have taken and what he wanted to do with the series if he had or gets the chance. Unfortunately, when I went to search him online to see if any progress could have been made, I found that he had recently passed. I barely knew this person from a DVD extra, and yet I felt as if my childhood died. However, if your a fan and wanted to know the exact happenings of Season 3, his notes were released online, so just look them up and you'll see an arc of story you never knew existed.

As for the DVD quality, they're brushed up VHS Broadcast master recordings to DVD. Some of the footage can get a little grainy or blury at times, but overall it's pretty good, and EXTREMELY better than any viewing previously seen before, ever! If you're a lifelong SatAM fan, you know what I mean.

Overall, I recommend this DVD Sonic set over any other series in a heartbeat. If you're looking to own all of the Sonic series, grab this one first, The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog next, Sonic Underground, then Sonic X. You won't regret this purchase, especially at this ridiculously low price! Have fun watching.",1298764800,,3161,4.252911813643927
2726906,5,B000M8N41W,"Those familiar with the current Sonic games and characters like Knuckles or Shadow might be surprised to find this vastly different series, produced in the early '90s at the height of Sonic's popularity. Video game cartoons of the time generally had choppy animation, bad music, and stock gags (The Mario Bros. Super Show, Captain N, and Legend of Zelda, for example). However this show goes above an beyond expectations, and holds its own apart from the games.

There are hints of the games' plot in this show, with animals trapped inside robots and super-fast Sonic having to free them, but it's been greatly expanded. Sonic's nemesis Dr. Robotnik has taken over the world and turned much of the population into robotic slaves. Sonic and his friends form a ragtag resistance in the forest, aiming to sabotage Robotnik at every turn and undo his damage. It sounds heavy at first, but it's actually well-handled, never being overly-preachy and breaking up some of the moodier situations with character gags. Generally episodes stand on their own, but particularly in the second season, there are some continuing plot threads.

The newly-introduced characters are well-handled, and help to balance Sonic's more ""extreme"" personality. The main new character is Sally, the cool-headed resistance leader. She and Sonic have a mutual ""thing"", but she still can't stand the more boorish, reckless part of his personality. Also introduced are Snively, Robotnik's long-suffering assistant, and the rest of Sonic's freedom fighters. While some are a little annoying, all are generally likable, and make it easy to get into the show.

The show is wrapped up nicely in the end, but teases episodes that unfortunately were never to be made (its failure to compete with Power Rangers cut it short of a third season). Still, while it lasted, Sonic the Hedgehog ran with the shallow plot of a '90s sidescroller and really made it worth watching.

The DVD itself is also well done, including storyboards, writer interviews, and production designs typical of Shout Factory's releases, really giving the set some value.",1291248000,,2101,5.152492668621701

2726908,5,B000M8N41W,"As most of you know, this series became known as Sonic SATAM since it aired every Saturday morning on ABC. The series is produced by DIC Entertainment and partnered with Sega of America. Another Sonic show -Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog- began airing around the same time as this series. Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is more of a kid friendly-light hearted show, while this series has a more dark-complex plot. Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be based off of the video games, but I find it more to be based off of the comics. I admit, when I first watched the show (I was about 5. I'm 22 now), I thought it was a bit scary. But as I got older, I grew to love it.

Boxart/packaging: This set comes in a nice thinpak Set with 2 DVDs cases. Each DVD case has 1 disc on each side totalling 4 DVD discs. 95% of the boxart was drawn by the fans. Some of the fanart closely resembles art from the show. The only artwork that isn't fanart is on the cover and on the spins. This set truly was made for the fans.

Video Transer: From the beginning of the first episode, I could still see lots grainy spots flickering everywhere. So far, I only noticed it in the first episode. The sound quality is excellent you don't have to turn your volume up too high to hear it. Most of the video seems to be restored and remastered. The colors are bright and colorful.

Features: Every episode has its opening and closing themes. Episodes are played in the original airdate order. The show is presented in it's original full frame (1:33:1) aspect ratio. This DVD set even includes the pilot episode (Heads or Tails) that aired on September 18th 1993. Audio and subtitles are only in English.

Overall: I just got this set in the mail today and I'm very happy I purchased it. Even if you didn't watch this back in the 90's, I still recommend this to all Sonic fans. Though I would only recommend this show for kids 8 and older. If you want a more kid friendly show, go for Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (another one of my favorite Sonic shows).

2726918,4,B000M8N41W,"Sonic the Hedgehog- The Complete Series

This is a 4-Disk DVD Set is for the original Sonic the Hedgehog Cartoon. Many people loved it in 1993 and 1994 when it was playing with Fox's Saturday Morning Line-up, along with the phenomenon known as the Power Rangers. The show was not given the respect it deserved and was often taken off the air so Fox could show Saturday morning sports. So, as a viewer you would not always get to see Sonic on Saturday. The Power Rangers would always be on...but that's a juggernaut that Fox felt safe with. Sonic ran two seasons, each of them being 13 episodes. The second season ended with a huge cliffhanger that I won't spoil, but Fox still cancelled the show.

Before I go on into the content, I'd like to say that I never watched this show as a kid. I thought this was a different Sonic, and ended up picking this up by mistake. So, I am a fanboy in no way at all. So, if you are someone who's never watched this series before, my review will most likely be a good view of things for you.

This cartoon was made before characters like Knuckles, Amy, and all those other Sonic characters were even made. The only ones in this series you'll probably know are Dr. Robotnik (Dr. Eggman), Sonic, and Tails. Sonic's homeland has been taken over by the maniacal tyrant Dr. Robotnik. He has a machine called the Robotizer that turns people into his robot slaves. He has also overrun the world with pollution. All of the world except the Great Forest and it's secret hideout for the Freedom Fighters, Knothole. I don't want to spoil too much about how it happened as it does that in an episode. Sonic and the Freedom Fighters are trying to stop Dr. Robotnik whatever way they can. The cartoon is really dark considering it's a Sonic cartoon.

The first two disks contain Season 1. Season 1 doesn't really stay on a strict storyline at all. They pretty much show random events that happen during the lives of the Freedom Fighters as they fight against Dr. Robotnik. Nothing really special except a few stand out episodes that don't consist of ""Let's do this to Robotnik, one of us gets caught, Sonic saves us"".

Disks 3 and 4 are amazing though. They contain Season 2, which was a truly touching season. It followed a storyline Project Doomsday. Robotnik was preparing something really evil and Sonic was trying to figure out what to do most of the season. For part of the season he is helping his robot uncle turn back into a human. In the series of two episodes, Sonic and Sally, his almost-girlfriend, go back in time and it is revealed what happened to the world. It's truly a great story with a really great final episode. It would've been great if they would've continued on with the series.

The Bonus features consist of storyboards, concept art, and deleted sequences. I'm not one of those people who like seeing the drawings, but luckily there were also two interviews that were really intriguing. There is one with Jaleel White (Family Matters), who did the voice of Sonic. Another is with Ben Hurst, who was a writer on the series. Both are really interesting and pretty long.

I can't give this 5 stars, mainly due to the first Season not being as interesting. I still suggest that any fan or non-fan pick this up and watch it. Also, whoever says the box art is bad is out of their mind. It's created out of Fan Art. It's not all the best, but the way it is put together like a collage is very cool looking.",1212364800,2,3448,4.472178060413355

2726920,4,B000M8N41W,"It took me a long time to really figure out what I thought about the popularly-dubbed SatAM. I've arrived at one conclusion; I love it. I think it's a wonderful cartoon. It does have its shortcomings, but all in all I am very fond of it. This dark yet eternally shining, all-too-short cartoon remains one of my favourites to this day - even if I missed it the first time around.

The disturbing plot sees the evil Dr Robotnik having taken over Mobius, particularly the capital city Mobotropolis, which he has turned into the robotic city Mobotropolis. Along with his assistant Snivelly, he has captured many citizens and - chillingly - turned them into robotic slaves (a process known as 'robotisizing'). Sonic and his motely fathering of friends have lost family members to this process, and unite under the name of the ""Freedom Fighters"". Operating from their secret base in Knothole Village, they work to overthrow Robotnik one step at a time, often with the help of other groups of Freedom Fighters around Mobius. This premise inspired the long-running Sonic comics, but contrary to popular belief it was SatAM who came first. The adventures of the FF span two series, distinctly different in plot and atmosphere, a planned third one infamously cancelled by people at ABC who didn't like the show. The second season was almost solely written by Pat Allee and Ben Hurst, and as such that season is the more consistent one.

The characters are definitely one of the series's biggest strengths. Sonic, Tails and Robotnik are the only staple characters - Robotnik now very much uncanny, completely different from his video-game renders even today - but the rest are a likeable, colourful bunch. They are; Sally, a tenacious squirrel and Sonic's secret crush; Bunny Rabbot, a partly-roboticised rabbit with a delightful southern-U.S. accent; Antoine, a coyote who was once a member of the palace guard, his cowardice only outdone by his French-muddled English; and then my favourite, Rotor the walrus, an inventor who supplies the FF with all their gadgets (even if they are of varying use). Each character has a personality; Sally is the unofficial 'leader' (her super-computer Nicole an endless help to the FF), Rotor's awkward but always ready to help out his friends if just with a spot of advice, Antoine is desperate to prove his worth but his cowardice often renders this difficult, and then Bunny keeps them all together with her good nature.

The animation itself is very good generally, and shows that the people making it did their homework. The voice acting is very good, too. Rotor's voice actor catches his personality very well, even though his voice took me some time to get used to, as I hear him speak in my head with a deeper voice than he does on the show. Bunny Rabbot's south-U.S. drawl is really heartwarming, and Antoine's arrogant but cowardly personality is perfectly captured by his voice actor (as well as his French accent). I have a love-hate relationship with Robotnik's voice, though, whose manner of speech consists mostly of evil whispers (which are chilling enough).

As said, the show saw two seasons. The first season, sadly, doesn't take the plot forward an inch. Its plots have little to do with the subject at hand; they range everything from races against robots to underground reservoirs that Robotnik has polluted. There are a few when the plot is vital, however, such as when Sonic and company try to rescue his robotisized uncle Chuck. But even though Robotnik is present for the majority of the season, the plot doesn't progress an inch. The second season is definitely the more concrete one; the Freedom Fighters' fight with Robotnik begins to make some progress, Sonic and co. meet with other groups of Freedom Fighters, e.g. the ram Ari and the wolf Lupe; the events that led to Robotnik's takeover are touched upon, and a final battle with Robotnik ensues.

There is one main flaw with the series, however, particularly during the second season; it tends to forget the significance of its supporting cast - we rarely see Bunny and especially Rotor in Season 2. Sally takes up way too much spotlight; one might almost go as far as dub the show 'The Sally Show'; meanwhile Rotor's gadget genius and Bunny Rabbot's martial arts skills are all but overlooked for the majority of the second season, which is a real shame. To make matters worse, ABC just couldn't lay off the show's crew, ordering them to introduce a new character for season 2 for the female audience to identify with... I ask you, in what way are Sally and Bunny NOT characters for the female audience to identify with?! The result is Dulcy the dragon, another character we see take far too much spotlight (and her ongoing crash jokes lose their zeal very quickly). To cap it off, I don't like Tails in this cartoon AT ALL - rather than Sonic's tenacious sidekick, he's a helpless little kid who has to be taught everything and sometimes even tucked in at night.

Yet in spite of this, the series does come out glowing. The story works out in a very nice way and retains its charm. The series could've been stronger had it been more faithful to its supporting cast - I have a hard time forgiving how Rotor's even left out of the final roar of celebration! And I who like him even more in the second season. On the whole, however, that's only enough to knock out one star. This is a cartoon deserving of its reputation, and this beautiful and informative set is a must have for all those who, like me, have been touched by the adventures of Sonic, Rotor and co.",1206835200,2,5572,4.768911917098445
2726921,5,B000M8N41W,"After all these years and many more great shows about Sonic the Hedgehog, this one is still the best.  Why is that?  Maybe it's because of the great cast of characters, including Jaleel White from ""Family Matters"" in the role of Sonic, and the wonderfully versatile Jim Cummings as the villain, Doctor Robotnik (known today as Dr. Eggman).  Maybe it's because the show relies on the original characters from the comic books, and not some of the more recent characters from the newer games.  It could be because of the dry wit and numerous puns that add humor to it.

This show came before at a time when Sonic had a feared villain. (I'm sorry but I am not going to fear a man named after a chicken fetus shell.(in other words, an egg.))

But anyways, this show was great as it brought a hard hitting tail of a worlds struggle for freedom, to our youth. Although after watching it as an adult I found it not as hard hitting as I originally thought. I just don't see why a world fighting for freedom would not use fire arms. I Guess it beats Pirates of Dark Water's sword fights. (block with sword then kick.)

None the less this show is 7 kinds of awesome. This show was so awesome that Archie comics continue to ride it's coat tails to this day with there mostly lame comics, which are surprisingly less hard hitting than as the show in question, but more hard hitting than the games.

So why should you get this? Because quit frankly, this is the best (and probably will stay the best) thing the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise has to offer. As long as Sega keeps Doctor Eggman in the roster, anyways.",1185408000,2,1189,4.3954545454545455

2726932,5,B000M8N41W,"What we have with this incarnation of Sonic the Hedgehog is arguably the most popular of the 3 American series by DiC and and Sonic X dubbed by 4kids.

With this story of Sonic it is the maturest out of all of them, has a much darker tone to it and dealt with real and adult issues.

SPOILER ALERT:

The episodes are written with a cinematic feel to them in that every episode felt big, dramatic and well worth watching.  Season Two is where every episode links up with each other leading up to the season finale that was the Doomsday project.

There was never a dull moment in this series entire run.  Particularly with the Antoine double episodes; I think this was done to add some comic relief to the series and the things that Sonic would put Antoine through was hilarious when you see him going nuts.

The voices matched the characters perfectly.  Jaleel White is always great as Sonic and Kathie Soucie made Princess Sally Acorn her own character by using her own naturalistic soothing, soft voice.  And Jim Cummings in my mind was the perfect voice over for Robotnik with the slow and sinister tone that he used in his voice.

What makes Sat-Am so appealable is that because it was produced in the early 90's it did not suffer the fate of most animated shows of the modern day and age where the dialogue is kiddified.  I don't think the dialogue in this show was terribly adult, and by that I don't mean profain material, there was no technical language that kids wouldn't understand.  But, the writers of the series wrote a dialogue that was cool with all ages.

What is disappointing was where the series was cancelled just as the writers/producers were getting ready to write and draw for Season 3.  Having said that, it didn't help matters that at the time, Power Rangers were extremely popular all over the world.  Ben Hurst talks about the plans that they would have done for the third Season and they are good.

I think it would be good for the series to be renewed because the writing and the characters had such depth and richness to them that made the show so enjoyable.

But until then, you can enjoy what is arguably the best Sonic animated series ever produced.

Sonic fans probably already know the premise behind these shows: Sonic and the Freedom Fighters are in a continuous guerrilla war with Julian Ivo Kintobor, or ""Robotnik,"" and his myriad robotic minions. Robotnik is able to augment his armies by ""roboticizing"" innocent Mobians (the anthropomorphic animals, like Sonic and his friends, that are the chief citizens of planet Mobius). Overall, the story is a dark saga of resistance that may seem somewhat trite (due to the similarities with ""The Matrix"" and the untold dozens of fictional worlds based upon similar premises), but it's still a good story. Fans of the Archie Sonic comics will easily find themselves at home with these cartoons, as they're essentially the same story and characters.

If you were a fan of the shows to begin with, don't hesitate--get these as soon as you can. Other Sonic fans may have a hard time reconciling the ordinarily bright, cheery Sonic universe with these serious shows, but they're pure gold, and I say go for it.",1179273600,18,1269,4.84331797235023

There are times where the show will make you laugh with how silly it is, and make you want to cry with how emotional and tragic the storyline can get.

The entire series is on a four disk set, and what I've seen so far has been great. The casing is covered in fan art which is fun. It shows that the true fans have been waiting a long time for this release. There aren't a lot of extras, but what I've seen so far are good.

This series is based on a world already conquered by Robotnik and the freedom fighters continuing struggle to defeat him and restore the planet to its former beauty. This is something that, to my knowledge has never been replicated in any other cartoon or game.

Overall this is a very good purchase and the quality is much better than those 14 or so year old Vhs tapes with episodes recorded from the TV. Plus there are some nice extras too, which is amazing considering the age of the cartoon. Kudos to whoever found out the deleted scenes and stuff.

I hadn't watched a single episode in well over 12 years and to my amazement, I still love this cartoon. I'm a huge Sonic fan. He was the first character I learned to draw, and now I'm a character designer.

If you were a fan of the series back in the day, stop reading and just get it.

What made this series so great was its incredibly deep and dark storyline (for a kids cartoon). The Sonic games (which I also love) were never big on storyline and still aren't to this day. The other Sonic series which ran during the weekdays was more closely based on the game's slapstick sort of corny story. The SatAM series is much different, portraying Dr. Robotnik as a very sinister villan. The whole freedom fighter concept has strong paralles with the Star Wars rebel forces theme.

The DVD contains all 26 episodes, including some commentaries from Jaleel White and Ben Hurst. Jaleel, most recognized for his work in Family Matters as Steve Urkel, does a great job of voicing Sonic.

2726944,5,B000M8N41W,"Sonic the Hedgehog or SatAM as it's referred by fans, was a show that really stands the test of time for various, justifiable reasons.  Quality storytelling, beautiful animation, and a score similar to John Williams.  The wonderful character development is what really got me immersed in the world of Sonic and its something that's unfortunately lacking in his current state.  With the recent cancellation of Sonic X and SEGA's realization of their next gen games, it's no surprise that they've acknowledged the brilliant, yet obscure universe that conveyed everything Sonic the Hedgehog should be.  Ironically characters such as Princess Sally, Bunnie Rabbot, and Rotor are still apparent in today's Archie Comics, but have never seen the light in a Sonic game (Sonic Spinball doesn't count, sorry).  For you youngsters out there that are fans of Shadow, Rouge, Amy, and Cream prepare to be amazed at the epic adventure that awaits you involving The Knothole Freedom Fighters!  Intended for a tween-teenager audience just be aware that it contains a darker atmosphere, a continuing plot, and emotional drama.  It really rides out as a classic sci-fi serial since each episode advances the story.  For those who don't know what a serial is, then just think Flash Gordon or Star Wars and you'll understand.  It's depressing that it took 12 years for this great masterpiece to be released to the public, but I'm glad I finally own it.

This is definitely a series that shouldnt be passed up by fans of science fiction or Sonic the Hedgehog.  The bonus features are nothing less than awesome.  Concept art, storyboards, fanart, and commentary from show writer Ben Hurst and Sonic himself aka Jaleel White.  I maybe 25, but after watching this set it still remains fresh and original.  The only haunting element is the fact that it ended on a cliffhanger when an intended third season was supposed to air.  In summation, I would give this collection higher than 5 stars.  The overall packaging and video/audio restoration is (as Sonic would put it) Way Past Cool!  In closing, Id like to say this.

Then of course, I also felt the need to entertain my classic craves because newer cartoons like Spongebob annoy me EVER so greatly. But they've done an excellent job of preserving the show just the way I remember it, and (although some of it is rather poorly drawn) I enjoyed the fact that SatAM fans were actually allowed to design the DVD's jacket/CD art themselves.  Way to go with that.

The navigation of the menues I found to be pretty straightforward and easy, and at least they devided the episodes into chapters unlike the season one Thundercats DVD (you have to watch the whole episode uninterupted from begining to end)

The biggest problem that I had with the DVD was the same problem I have with most DVD sets of classic cartoons: the special features really weren't much.  As I figured, I got the DVD mostly to watch the shows, I knew I wasn't going to be getting much in the way of 'production videos'.

The short review: Way Past Cool! If you're a fan of the series you have to have this DVD collection!

The long review:

EPISODES
For anyone who's had to stand watching cut or badly recorded episodes from TV, I can't express how good it feels to watch these in clear stereo with no tracking lines and perfect picture. I can even see the paintbrush strokes in the background art it's so clear! So far as I can tell, everything has been restitched back together wonderfully and I can see no weird edits. It's just like I remember in Ben Hurst's words ""fresh - like watching it for the first time!""

BONUS FEATURES
A few people have complained about the lack of bonus features, but I can't say good enough about them. The series was produced 10 years ago, since then most if not all of the artwork in the vaults has been lost, sold online (I've seen a number of cels pass by there) or locked away. The fact they managed to find even a small amount of high-quality artwork makes it well worth the trouble. I too wish there was more, but the stuff they did find is very good. I believe there are really only two bits of the extended/deleted scenes that are truly new material but it's all well archived and the one silent animatic has the script super-scripted in so it's easy to follow. The concept art is beautiful, there are a few new model/expression sheets in the interview with Hurst and tons of background art that will blow you away. This is the same quality one would expect in feature post production work. Both of the interviews are engaging, enlightening and even a little tearful at times, especially Ben's moving speech about Season 3 and his support for the fans. Considering how hard the crew at FUS has worked to get this DVD, they deserve it. The DVD menus themselves are a blast -- I have seen a number of poorly produced menus with ""craptastic"" art in them and these blow me away. They are thoughtful and even funny! In one part Snively hits the ""Bonus Features"" button. It's the little things like that which show the effort and care they put into making the DVD.

BOX ART
Okay so some of the artists who contributed art are very young and aren't what you would call ""good artists"". But to me, it's refreshing to see a company that actually WANTED and ACCEPTED input from the fan base. It shows that we are all united together as fans of Sonic, no matter what our background is. You can tell each of the artists was excited and trying their best to make something to show how much they love the show. I go as far to say a few of these artists ARE exceptional, some of them even drawing ""on-model"" as we in the animation business say. Ken Penders (while not really a fan per se since he's worked professionally on Sonic Artwork) did a pretty good job with the cover, as it did include most of the cast and it doesn't show anything that isn't there (Thank Goodness his arms aren't blue either :D). Compared to the first test cover, this final one is much better. Dr. Robotnik is the best part of the cover, he's very well drawn.

ANYTHING ELSE?
Just so you know where I'm coming from, I was prime age when SATAM came out, being 10 at the time, and it is a big reason I am who I am today and certainly a reason why I'm going into the animation industry. That being said I can't express enough why it's important to support this release. They did a fantastic job. And I think it's worth buying this for any Sonic fan, especially if you know someone who likes Sonic X --

In Sonic's words, ""Get ready to rock, cause this will knock your socks off!"" :)

If you're new to Sonic and like this series, I highly recommend checking out Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic Underground as well (the other two shows produced by DiC, the predecessor to SATAM and it's later cousin, respectively.) A lot of fans would say otherwise but I just can't get enough of the blue blur!

Most Sonic fans have a poor artistic sense to begin with. I imagine that most of the artists that got on board to do the art were from the Fans United for SatAM forum.

I'm only picking this up for 2 things, Season 2, because I haven't seen Season 2 in ten years and to have the kid-in-bed DiC logo on DVD (I HOPE they kept it in there and haven't replaced it with the rainbow globe!).

And I'm into a lot of Japanese, including anime.  And I know I'll like this DVD, which everyone has waited years for, myself included, after it quit airing on ABC.  No more looking through old worn out VHS tapes, which are probably missing episodes that weren't recorded.

2726952,5,B000M8N41W,"When I heard about Bike Mice from Mars was getting revived last year, after ten years of being cancelled, I wonder about the Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM) series. I come to find that Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM) is still being talked about today, and still has a fanbase, if not a bigger fanbase than when the show originally back in 1993

Oh man, I remember I watched this Sonic the Hedgehog series religiously when it original aired, when I was five years old. I can't believe it's FINALLY out on DVD.

I'd get up every Sunday at 8am here in the UK just to watch it, or every Saturday if you're an American viewer. But anyway, this was - and still is, in my opinion - the best Sonic the Hedgehog series ever, nothing against [i]Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (I used to watch that as well)[/i], or [i]Sonic Underground[/i] or [i]Sonic X[/i]

Sonic the Hedgehog, or SatAM as it now known, had everything. Action, adventure, romance, comedy etc. The show had a great plot, the continuity of the show just kept you watching (especially in the 2nd Season). You didn't know what would happen next.

Also the animation was perfect for the show and added to the tone of the show, which was a darker than the previous series, [i]Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog[/i]. The writing was just brilliant, especially in Season 2. I think overall Season 2 was the more memorable of the two seasons. Thank you for that Ben Hurst, and of course Pat Allee, who co-wrote it.

The voice acting cast on the show was great, you some of the best voice actors in the business. Jaleel White was great as the main character (He IS Sonic the Hedgehog), Kath Soucie, Jim Cummings and Charlie Adler, who gave great memorable performances as Robotnik and Snively, respectively. Especially Jim Cummings, his portray of Robotnik also made Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM) very memorable.

It ashame that Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM) ended on a cliffhanger at the end of Season 2, this show has so much potential, and it also HAD a fanbase, which I think is now obvious by the fansites that have appeared in the last few years. I'd be nice to see a revival of Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM), I know it not likely but you never know.

Hey, if Bike Mice from Mars, which got revived last year - after 10 years of it being gone, surely there still some hope of a Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM). A new series, or maybe a movie based on the show - I like many fans would love to see those one day. Hey, anything's possible.

What else can I say about Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM) that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. This the BEST Sonic the Hedgehog series EVER made, if you're a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog SEGA games or just an animation fans in general. I strongly recommend that you check this series out, you won't be disappointed.",1171497600,9,2794,4.507905138339921
2726953,5,B000M8N41W,"If you are a Sonic X fan, then you will definatly love this series.

  I like this series also because it has so many well known voice actors. Of course we should all know that Sonic was voiced by Jaleel White whom we all know as Steve Urkel from Family Matters. Tails was voiced by Bradley Pierce who also played as Peter on Jumanji. Princess Sally was voiced by Kath Souice who also voiced Lolla Bunnie on Space Jam. Dr. Robotnik was voiced by Jim Cummings who played on many movies but my favorite role he did was of Steel on the movie Balto.

Shout! Factory acually worked with the fans to get their input on various aspects of this boxed set, in order to ensure that this would be a set truely worthy of the show's fans. The end result is a long-awaited boxed set that's a must-have for any SatAM fan.",1170979200,5,378,4.323943661971831
2726955,5,B000M8N41W,I would love this for my dvd. I saw this on ABC and Synd in the 90s.,1170979200,2,68,3.0588235294117645
2726956,5,B000M8N41W,"The fans have been waiting for a proper release of this series for years now, and it's finally here. It's quite literally my childhood dream come true.

For those who have been following the various forums, you'll know that the fans have had a very large degree of freedom in voicing what they wanted in the box set. It was truly a labor of love further epitomized by the fan artwork that was used.

What else can one say? We are lucky to have the show on a DVD release at all; the extras are just icing on the cake.

For those who aren't fans (yet) like animation enthusiasts and so on, I will say this: some people dislike the show, while many others have a deep emotional attachment to it, particularly those who grew up watching it. I recommend checking out the IMDB forums on the series; see what people have to say about it. This is commonly known as the ""Dark"" Sonic series, with its police state undertones and Matrix esq scenery and contrasts. Many consider it to be quite profound for a piece of animation, with characters that have great strengths and yet great weaknesses. The great use of foils I particularly well done (note the differences in character interactions between Sonic, Tails, and Sally).  This is a series that is definitely worth viewing, certainly at least once.

Highly recommended.",1170028800,,1312,4.613733905579399

8167149,3,B000M8N41W,"This show is a bit too dark and intense for the small fry. When my inside was 6 years old back when it aired, I thought it was too much. Such as the villain, Dr. Robotnik, aka Dr. Eggman, is more malevolent than he was on ""The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"", a certain female leader, Princess Sally Acorn, is too firmed for tots, characters being roboticized looked like they're being electrocuted, lots of warfare shooting, scarier voices and images, and kissing between the two characters. ""The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" is more suitable for like ages 5 and up and ""Sonic Underground"" would be more suited for 7 year olds since it's not heavy like ""Sonic SatAM"".",1501113600,,675,4.680672268907563
