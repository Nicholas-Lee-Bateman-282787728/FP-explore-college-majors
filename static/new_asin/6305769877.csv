7894015,4,6305769877,"I have always been a big fan of Ruby Braff since my high school days in the mid-60's.  He has very distinctive style in that he mainly stays in the bottom octave and half of the instrument rarely straying above middle C.  That being said, he has always done a remarkable job at communicating inventive improvisations.  Being a student of the trumpet/cornet I can appreciate the close-ups of Ruby's embochure, which is with a very light pressure.

Howard Alden is a marvel. There is no need for a piano when he's in the group as he can solo and comp to himself.  His effortless playing is amazing to watch.

I was not familiar with bassist Frank Tate before, but I was very impressed with his strong melodic bass lines and improvs.

As Shuma ""Ralph"" reviewed, there isn't much variety in tone colors with but 3 instruments, and his suggestion of listening in two sessions is a good idea, but if you listen closely to what's going on you will be rewarded.",1297641600,2,953,4.538011695906433
7894016,3,6305769877,"Don't be mistaken. I think Ruby Braff is one of the greatest cornet players in the world and a true jazz master.

The reason then for my relatively low rating is that there is not much variety in the performances. The group, who are great musicians in their own right, just don't spark. Another wind instrument would have made all the difference by adding more variety, texture and colour to the overall performances. Everything is too even, if you know what I mean.

Best watched in two parts, several days apart.",1099872000,,514,4.637362637362638
