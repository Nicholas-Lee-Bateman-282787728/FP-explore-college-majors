It is educational and action packed, perfect for you scientifically curious little ones. I am surprised more people don't know about it!",1384300800,,274,4.978260869565218
8403005,4,B003R2BWKU,"The New Adventures of Nanoboy, the world's smallest superhero  With simple art and animation this little DVD will entertain your kids for a long time. The thing I like is that the story also captures the adult's attention and does not have the annoying voices some children's entertainment has. The crises in the film are child-sized and not too scary. Good for about ages 5 - 8.",1280016000,6,379,4.656716417910448
