8207562,4,B000T28PIS,"This is not just about vests; it discussed shatter-proof windows, bullet-resistant cars, etc.  This documentary works on so many levels.

First, it balances the scientific with the historical.  It spends about ten minutes saying, ""When the Greeks carried shields and the Romans wore leather and the 1300s warriors wore armored suits, that was about being bulletproof.""  If you don't care for science and technology, then you'll love the historical discussion.  I was shocked to learn that the word ""bulletproof"" was invented in the 1600s.  One speaker says, ""Proof meant test in the past.""  If you know the Spanish word ""probar,"" you would easily see the connection.

Second, ""for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.""  If you make a bulletproof vest or other object, eventually someone is going to work on making a bullet that can pierce it.  The cat-and-mouse nature of this subject was fascinating.

Third, ""appearance is everything.""  The documentary said the Pope-mobile could have had a machine gun placed in it, but the Pope disapproved of that.  Armored trucks are meant to look imposing when other cars try to hide their bulletproof qualities.

This work may really inspire students interested in engineering and science.  I did think the spokesmen (purposely gendered) for the companies mentioned here were shamelessly self-promoting.  Free advertising, y'all!  As a dove, I worry about things that are too rah-rah over weapons.  However, this work asserts that new technology could help stop terrorists, criminals, and murderers.",1196208000,4,1557,5.337448559670782
