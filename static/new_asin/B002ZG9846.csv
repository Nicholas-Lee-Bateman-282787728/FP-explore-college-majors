4019988,5,B002ZG9846,"The movie KICK ASS lives up to it's title. It's another movie based off a comic book. I wouldn't even call it a super hero movie, because it really wasn't one. It was a action, comedy that mixed in some drama.

The story is easy to follow, a unpopular kid named Dave Lizewski(Aaron Johnson). One day he thinks why hasn't anyone tried to be a super hero before. So he decides to become one and Kick Ass is born. The comedy follows, as one early scene he tries to find a cat by show the picture to random people in his costume. Eventually he gets in over his head and runs into Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl(Chloe Moretz). Things get more serious, but the movie never leaves what it's best at it's comedy.

I won't give more of the story away, so I'll move on to the acting and actors which was great. Though for me two stole the whole movie. First Nicolas Cage was simply great. His best movie since LORD OF WAR. Then there was Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. This was a dangerous role playing a child who's killing people. I'm sure there's some in the media who will be appalled, but it's just a movie it has no bearing on society or the down fall of it. Chloe did a outstanding job blending he childishness with cold and calculating killer. The best was her chemistry with Cage, you could just tell they enjoyed working together and were having fun.

The action and directing by Matthew Vaughn was extremely well done.  The music was also really good.

Kick Ass is the best movie of the year for me so far. I highly recommend this movie, I really don't think you'll be disappointed.  I plan on seeing it again.",1271376000,4,1612,4.321192052980132
4019989,4,B002ZG9846,"New York, The Present: Dave Lizewski is, by his own admission, a non-descript kind of teenager who drifts from one unremarkable day of high-school to the next. He spends his days fixating on his English teacher's breasts, reading comic books, hanging out at the local comic store with his equally feckless friends and wasting far too much time on social networking sites on the internet. It is this life of unremitting banality - as well as his own inherent naivety - that leads him to don a green and yellow diving suit and mask and attempt to live the life of a superhero. However, as Dave is about to find out, trying to dispense comic book justice and cookie-cutter morality on the streets of a mob-town like New York can be a very dangerous idea indeed...

Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick Ass"" is a glorious satire of the notions of super-heroism, vigilantism, fanboy culture and Gen Y's obsession with spectacle and hyper-reality; I also suspect that is probably a very faithful adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book (and whilst I haven't read this particular book myself, I am familiar enough with the rest of Millar's work to recognise the pertinent hallmarks of lunatic genius that have made the mad Scotsman a ""force majeure"" in the comic book industry) given that it is violent, foul-mouthed, disturbing and amusing in equal measures (and on a number of different levels) and it is, for the most part, whip-smart. As a screen outing, its also a far more satisfying depiction of Millar's obsessions than the awful ""Wanted"" movie (a film which took an amoral tale told amorally and attempted to sanitise it for the screen).

I can't really go into too many details of the plot without ruining this film but all I will say this: if you're sick of the nauseating pontification that gets shoe-horned into most modern American action cinema, then this will be right up your alley because its a glorious fart in the face of conventional cinematic wisdom and morality. Parents should be warned though that despite being tangentially about superheroes, this film is emphatically NOT suitable for children. Don't let the shiny costumes fool you. It is an adult fairy tale with a pronounced accent on the ""adult"".

For the record, my partner and I generally despise Superheroes and Superhero movies on the grounds that most of them are nauseatingly smug morality plays which have no basis in reality - that was not the case with this film. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it left us wanting to adopt a ""Hit-Girl"" of our very own.",1270944000,7,2523,4.795402298850575
4019990,5,B002ZG9846,"The advertising campaign promoting this film has misled you.  First off, it's even funnier than you're expecting.  Secondly, it's really and truly not.

I have never in my life witnessed a film that so successfully blended laugh-out-loud comedy with heavy, intensely graphic action and dire drama, and Kick Ass will often switch amongst all three in a single scene.  It's wise to bring tissues to the theater for when the coke splurts out of your nose from intense laughter, but you may need it for wiping away a tear, as well.  And it will definitely come in hand when the guy behind you jumps up and screams ""F--- YEAH!"" while accidentally knocking his cup onto your lap.  Kick Ass is likely to provide all three experiences, and it is truly and unexpectedly a cinematic triumph as a result.

At the heart of this mixing of genres is Nicholas Cage's character, ""Big Daddy,"" who effortlessly alternates amongst surreal and unbalanced father of the year, dead-on Adam West impersonator, and poignant tragic hero without blinking an eye.  I've never liked Nicholas Cage prior to seeing this film (even I'm not sure why), but I just became his biggest fan after watching this.  The rest of the cast does stellar work as well, but this film couldn't have soared the way it does without Cage's presence.

Beyond that, the camera work, editing, and soundtrack all do an incredible job of keeping you glued to the screen throughout.  If you're coming to this film looking for yet another easily assembled (and easily forgotten) spoof film of the season, you're likely to find yourself barking up the wrong tree.  I'm going to smack myself for saying something this cliche, but, for lack of better terminology, Kick Ass kicks ass.

One obligatory warning in this otherwise glowing review: Kick Ass is not for everyone.  If you have a problem with graphic violence, particularly when it involves children, stay far away from this film.  Hit Girl, who appears to be 10 or 11 years old, is far from your standard side-kick who watches safely from the sidelines.  In fact, most of the graphic violence and death depicted in this film are thanks to her character.  Yes, there is a message in this film that the way she has been raised was neither healthy nor appropriate, but it's likely to get lost in the cheers and laughs that are elicited by her many exploits.  In general, the major issue that seems to separate these characters from their fictional heroes, even more than their naivety, is the fact that they see no problem with killing criminals.  Don't expect a heavy-handed Batman moral about not stooping to bad guys' level, either.  These guys pick up just as many guns and fire as indiscriminately.",1270684800,12,2698,4.786177105831533

The plot, the characters, the action and the flow of humor with reality is just so well mixed. I have to say that after a while I realized that this movie reminds me of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The movie does not feel like a super hero movie at all but more like a WHAT IF Action type film. Using the super hero theme to mask the violence and the idea of teens involved in some serious crime fighting. This movie is definitely on its way to becoming a Cult Classic!",1513814400,,633,4.19672131147541
4020090,4,B002ZG9846,"I dunno. It's pretty good. Not sure I'd watch it multiple times, but hey. At least now I can say I watched it! Although, I do have to say this thought I had, right at the beginning of the movie:
""I like how a guy dressed up in a costume can jump off a building in New York, and everyone just starts claping, then, when it gets serious, they just get the ""oh that's too bad"" look like oh, that's too bad.""
Other than that, it was attention grabbing enough, that I didn't really have time to comment on things in it. At least till it was over.
Not sure how Red Mist and Kick-Ass didn't recognize each others voices, but sure. It's a movie. That's how these things work",1513209600,,666,4.130769230769231

4020191,4,B002ZG9846,"I loved this move around 2010-2012. After not watching it from around 2012 until 2017, it was a little rough to watch.

My appreciation for this movie is partially my nostalgia, and the rest is me enjoying it. There have been a few funny super hero type movies after Kick-Ass that did some things better/funnier, so returning to Kick-Ass seemed kind of bland.

Still, it is a solid super hero parody that still provides exceptional drama for anybody who needs a comedy/drama-parody in their lives.",1512864000,,497,4.8352941176470585

4020197,5,B002ZG9846,"I give this movie five stars---but it should be 4.25 or so. There are some major flaws and instances that just don't make any sense...and it would have been nice if the producers & directors caught them---because they made the SAME STOOPID mistakes in the sequel. When they make Kick Ass 3, they should really preview the movie to simple fans---and take their simple advice. This being the First Kick Ass---it was extremely entertaining. Hit Girl literally hits this one outta the Park !!! Chloe is one of those child stars that famously gives an outstanding Unique performance that is a JOY to see !! Catch it if you can, because these child actors rarely repeat such a fabulous ride ( unfortunately )...akin to a shooting star---ZIP---it's gone...I have been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage from his performance in ""Raising Arizona""---but here his character didn't work. I liked the part where he was training his daughter to take a bullet while wearing a vest---but then the movie CONTRADICTS itself, later, when Hit Girl gets shot.

4021014,5,B002ZG9846,"This is one of those movies, that is just fun to watch.  It's a movie where an average guy questions why with so many superhero movies and comics no one has ever put on a costume and fought crime as a superhero.  Being just an average kid at high school he decides to give it a go.  It doesn't go to well and he ends up in hospital.  However he now has nerve endings and a metal plate in his back that allows him to take a bit of beating as he feels pain less.  The next time he tries to fight crime doesn't go to well either but a crowd with mobile phone cameras witness the fight, the thugs get camera shy and run off and he's the most famous guy in the world.  However he's still not much of a superhero, luckily for him an 11 year old girl who is the daughter of a cop framed for a crime he didn't commit, who upon release has trained her to be a vigilante with him and has all the martial arts and weaponry skills he lacks.  Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is by far the star of the movie, but  Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Dave / Kickass does a great job too as a teen who is out of his depth.  You've also got the normal high school problems of liking a girl who doesn't think your cool than shows an interest because she thinks your gay and has always wanted a gay friend.

The son of the city's crime lord is also quiet fun to watch too.  Kick-Ass is violent and bloody, when someone gets hit, they get hurt, broken or die, just like in real life.  This is easily one of the best movies that have ever been made.",1464739200,,1508,3.973421926910299

It's supposed to be funny but the whole thing is just depressing and overly violent for no reason.  I chuckled once, the rest of the time I was just staring at it in a state of confusion, unable to determine why anyone would ever find this entertaining.

The characters are unlikeable, devoid of anything to motivate you to root for them or against them.  Even the main villain is a generic lifeless walking clich of the typical ""mob boss"".

I would love to give it zero stars, but unfortunately that isn't an option, but trust me when I say that 1 star is far too high.

4021167,1,B002ZG9846,"Sick and twisted beyond belief. The film really attacks different racial groups. The way the ' good guys' kill them..They torture and kill these people in slow sadistic ways.  They way they get cut up. No one deserves to die like that. The body count. The lust for blood.  In one movie one little girl has more confirmed kills than "" The Teminator"", "" Die Hard"" "" Scarface"" and John Wayne Gacy combined. LITTLE GIRL. HAS CONFIRMED KILLS. She doesn't just shoot people either.  Her victims are cuffed, crushed until their organs explode and strangled until they die. Other victims are assaulted and tortured.  It's not cartoon like.
  I saw this deranged film. Now the image of a little girl coming up behind a man and cutting him open will never leave my mind.  Then she chops off another mans leg, impales him through the ribs, pinning him to the floor.  She smiles in satisfaction as she leans on the blade.  He suffers and bleeds at her feet.  She's only begun.  She uses midieval european weapons meant to chop off limbs, disembowel and pull the intestines out of a enemy.  The horrifying attacks are done blitz assassination style. A young man around 20 years old exits the bathroom. She shows him the knife trick and puts a blade in his stomach.  An adult woman enters the room. She's horrified to find her friends lying dead on the floor.  The little girl furiously stabs the frightened woman in the chest multiple times with a large kitchen knife.  Then she puts her dead body on display.
Her father is a organized psychopathic serial killer who,  in a demented state, dresses up as Batman at night. This Batman kills daily and encourages his young daughter to kill. He gives her weapons so she can 'play'.
A father turning his 11 year old daughter into a mass murderer is a outrage.  She uses night vision goggles, giving her a critical advantage when committing mass murder at night. She cuffs a man and puts him in a car crusher. Now helpless, he sputters and tries to talk his way out of a nasty death. In a sadistic act the man is slowly crushed to death. Her father looks on with approval.  She hurls insults at him as he dies horribly.
 She lures her victims close by pretending to be a poor lost little girl. When the person stops to help she pulls out a concealed gun and shoots them in the head.
 The message of this film is ' Killing strangers is fun. It'll give you a thrill'.",1460851200,,2396,4.489607390300231

4021582,5,B002ZG9846,"Not for the faint of heart, this movie has a chilling overtone of often graphic comic-book violence. The premise is intriguing: What if ""super"" hero crimefighters were actually just a bunch of talented but very dysfunctional anti-social misfits running around in outlandish homemade costumes and armed to the teeth? Oddly enough, the frequently disturbing graphic violence actually works: it's doled out in appropriate (at least for THIS film) amounts that serve to move the plot along and add credibility to the characters motives. This is a very iconoclastic rendition of comic book heroes and villains: ripping away the clinically sanitized facade of the genre, it comes across as a more believable version of what it might be like for REAL super heroes battling REAL criminals.

Next this same girl shows up in a scene performing gruesome acts of violence after calling all who are present the ''c'' word. I had to rewind it to see if I heard her right, yes, she actually said it! After brutally killing all in the room except for the other ''hero'', she then calls him an ''a..hole''. What?! Rewind again, yep, that's what she called him!  Next few lines coming out of her mouth include douche and the other 'c' word which refers to the male anatomy. Rewind again, yep, that's what she said!

This is the writer's notion for a female ''super hero''? An 11 y.o. doing and speaking awful, foul things while dressed up like a prostitute with purple wig, lipstick and tight spandex suit?! Unbelievable. I'm trying to un-see this film, wash my mind clean of it. I could only bare to watch half of it.

4021866,4,B002ZG9846,"As an adult fan of comic books and comic book movies, I thought this was a pretty good movie.  My one complaint is that a movie like this should never have been released with an R rating.  I don't think the movie would have been any worse if it had been edited to get a PG-13 rating.  The target audience of this movie is clearly children and teens.

Call me a prude if you want, but I don't think it is socially responsible to release an R-rated movie that is clearly directed at children as its target audience.",1440547200,,513,4.204081632653061

The simple but snaking Plot, along with GREAT Casting pulled it all together. The ball-scratching tone of the dialog might not have worked in the hands of a Director other than Mr. Vaughn and with less capable actors. Everyone conspired to make it work; a one-of-a-kind movie. The later sequel did not stick with the simplicity of the original concept, so KA2 was not as much fun as this film (that sequel was brutally censored by the studio(s).",1440201600,,565,4.549019607843137

4022524,5,B002ZG9846,"This movie is the best superhero movie I have ever watched. Guess why? Because there is no superhero, that is why... Well there is actually a few but none with magical superpowers. The story is about an ordinary high school boy who is an avid fan of comic books. He admires all those characters and decides to be one of them to get noticed by people around him and be respected. This innocent and rather unrealistic idea leads him to a bunch of funny circumstances including a lot of near dead experiences most of them being really painful. But on the other hand, he manages to become an internet celebrity and this changes his bad luck with the girls. Things get even more complicated when a big crime organization and other superheros get into the story.

The last parts were slightly closer to the superhero cliches but other than that I really liked the plot line as well as acting. Apart from the kickass character, hit girl, big daddy, and red mist all add a different perspective to the movie and make it something like a 'behind the scenes' version of a regular superhero movie.

Wholeheartedly recommended to those who want a combination of a teen movie and a real interesting superhero movie",1428710400,,1201,4.633802816901408

4023398,5,B002ZG9846,"This movie is a great over the top action movie about what could (kind of) happen if someone tried to be a superhero.  It has moments where it will make you cringe because of the brutality and then laugh at something ridiculous.  Of course the villains are ridiculous and some crazy one liners will make you go wtf but that's a huge part of the charm.  One of the things that makes it great and like i said tough to watch at times is the violence.  I'm not talking about the climax with the amazing final fight, I'm talking about the violence kickass faces on his way to become who he is.  It's not great because it's violent, it's great because this is what would really happen. I like that it shows that you can't just put on a costume or a suit of some kind and expect to win fights, there is even a conversation between kickass and his friends on why this is and why Batman can do it.  I highly recommend it and get the Blu ray for sure.  The picture and sound is not something you would want to sacrifice at all with a movie like this.",1410048000,,1040,4.144278606965174

4023533,3,B002ZG9846,"As anyone would suspect, Hollywood Henry is a fan of comic-book, superhero movies. But,
and I think most audience members would agree, the genre has been tapped for a few years 
how many origin stories do I have to sit through? I get it  average person having a rough time
in life gets thrust into a traumatizing situation that turns them into a superhero. It definitely has
been overdone (though with the box office returns for superhero movies not slowing down, it
seems everyone still loves them). That is why when heard of Kick-ass was a film that spun the
genre in a new direction, I had high hopes.
Kick-ass is the name our lead character, a high school student named Dave, adopts as his
superhero alter ego, when he asks the question  why cant regular people just don a costume
and fight crime? Of course, without any sort of radio-active powers or gamma rays to enhance
his power, Dave really is just a regular person, which is apparent after his first confrontation
lands him in the hospital.
The problem is, the film starts out to be something different, but it quickly turns into an average
superhero film. It really is not that innovative at all; Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight
involving a crime lord, and a few other people decide to also try their hand at being masked
avengers. Which brings us to the best part of the movie: Hit-Girl.
Hit-Girl is an 11-year-old swearing, crime-fighting girl, played by Chloe Moretz. Yes, Hit-Girl is
violent and knows how to use a weapon or two, but she also provides the best parts of the film.
I realized our lead Dave was basically following around Hit-Girl and taking his cues from her - I
wondered why the film was not just titled Hit-Girl? If it was, I probably would recommend this
movie, but as it is now  eh
There has been criticism that the film glorifies violence, which may lead younger viewers to
idolize the brutal tactics seen in the film. Well, for starters, the film is rated R, so it is not for
younger viewers. And films over the years have had plenty of cowboys, gun-slingers, mobsters
and cops - I think audiences are savvy enough to understand the difference between reality
and entertainment.",1408406400,,2171,4.602067183462532

4023675,3,B002ZG9846,"Simply put, 2010s Kick-Ass is not for children.  You may think that because it stars kids and its a superhero movie that its appropriate for Family Movie Night, but trust me, its not.  This film, while enjoyable, is closer to the ultraviolence of A Clockwork Orange than the comic book violence of any Marvel movie.

Now that weve gotten that out of the way, whats great about Kick-Ass is that it seems pretty close to reality in that if a real teenager put his mind up to becoming a superhero one day (in this case, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass), he wouldnt take into consideration the fact that, oh yeah, maybe Ill get shot or stabbed or end up in some other perilous, over-my-head situation of which I will have a hard time getting out (and count my lucky stars when I do).

However, if you're raised by a psycho ex-cop with a vengeance (Nicolas Cage), then you may turn out to be the whip-smart and trigger-happy Mindy Macready, a.k.a. Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace-Moretz), who was essentially programmed to seek revenge on those that her father, Damon Macready (also known as Big Daddy) believes are responsible for her mothers/his wifes death.

Hit-Girls acrobatics will have you gripping your lower back and longing for your younger days.  She may be tiny, but wed take Hit-Girl as our back-up over Kick-Ass any day of the week.  Shes fast, shes feisty, and shes simply too good with anything you put in her hand, be it a gun, a knife, or what have you.

Cage, as usual, is his over-the-top self, particularly in one scene (youll know it when you see it) which, for the life of me, I cant figure out why they wouldnt call cut and have him re-shoot it.  The scream, while maybe necessary, could have been emitted with a fraction of the ridiculousness.  It makes you crack up when you probably shouldnt.

Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Chris DAmico, the son of Frank DAmico (Mark Strong), the head of a crime syndicate.  When Kick-Ass gets in the way of DAmicos affairs, his son volunteers to dress up as a superhero and earn Kick-Ass trust so that he can bring him back to his father.  DAmico subsequently becomes Red Mist with a dope-ass ride, and theres just something about Mintz-Plasse that makes every role he plays an enjoyable romp, even when hes technically the bad guy (or at least part of the problem).

Keep an eye out for American Horror Story/X-Men: Days of Future Pasts Evan Peters, who plays Todd, one of Lizewskis best friends.  Hes so young and fresh-faced, and while his role here is pretty much unmemorable, its a kick in the pants to see him before he made it really big.

Theres just something about Kick-Ass thats lacking in terms of a superhero film - probably because its characters are intentionally un-superhero-ey.  But they do get bonus points for making a reference to the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World series, and it certainly holds its own more as a graphic novel adaptation (original work by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr.), rather than as a big-budget summer blockbuster.",1406505600,,3021,4.702087286527514
4023676,5,B002ZG9846,"I don't know why, but I really liked this flick. I guess I was just tired of your run of the mill superhero movie.

4023924,5,B002ZG9846,Kick ass is one of my favorite superhero movies lets see it has Nick cage has big daddy i mean he plays in a lot of good movies this is about how a boy becomes a superhero because he's tired of all the crime. because 2 guys jump him from behind and a guys watching and the guy just. turns around and lets it happen then he becomes famous after he helps a guy out from being beat up and it's put on you tube and then he meats hit girl and big daddy when he goes to his soon to be girlfriends apartment bulding who she hangs out with and hit girl kills all the people who were in there and plus theres also red mist hes the villians son in here because he thinks kick ass killed his friends so i will let you watch the rest on your own but it mabey about superheros but it's rated R because it's based on the graphic novel. so it ain't for kids,1404259200,,842,3.8728323699421967

A lot of controversy came out about this film and the character Hit-Girl's potty mouth.  I didn't mind it, and thought Chloe did an amazing job creating the live action character.  A few curse words here and there didn't deter me from loving the film for what it was.  A great film.

The thing I like most about the film is that the character of Kick-Ass is a normal kid with no super powers.  He sucks at fighting, and gets his [butt] kicked more than kicking [butt], as the name implies.  It's more realistic in this sense, than some of the other big name comic to films.  I realize that these are totally different comic universes, with different laws of comic fiction, but it is nice to have an every day nerdy kid don a horrible looking costume and try to fight crime.

It was comedic, adventurous, and it packed with action from right os the starting line leading the viewer on a madcap race to its conclusion.",1399939200,,260,4.8
4024116,5,B002ZG9846,"First and foremost, does Kick Ass live up to it's title? Yes, Kick Ass does kick all that ass, cliche joke out of the way, let's begin.

I'm not a real big fan of conventional superhero movies, but don't get me wrong, there have been a few that I actually enjoyed, for example; Superman 1,2, Returns and Man of Steel, All Of The Batman Movies (Sans Forever and Batman and Robin), Spiderman 2, and even The Avengers was pretty cool. This movie is not a conventional superhero movie in the least, and in that, it is amazing.

There was so much I loved about this movie.

The tititual character was great. I felt like he was a perfect way for the audience to connect with the main situation in the movie and the other superheroes we meet along the way.

You're probably gonna here this from everyone who saw the movie; Hit Girl made this movie.
Of the characters in this film, she was the best, the most bad ass, the most irreverent, and the most kick ass (it's a cliche joke, but if it ain't broke, than don't fix it). If I ever put together a top 10 Comic Book/Graphic Novel Characters List, she is definitely on there.

Nicholas Cage was awesome as well. It's been a whiles since i've seen him in a movie and said that.
His character ""Big Daddy"" was a bad ass; if I could describe him, he was like a gun wielding Batman with a sense of humor.

The main villain in this movie worked for the story. I do realize that in a story like this, it's gonna be a little bit of time before we see super villains (I heard that McLovin i.e. the main villains son in this film, is a villain in the second movie, and that got me excited)

I think the reason why this movie worked so well was excuse of how well written it was. The fact that they where able to connect the story to real life only made the movie that much more awesome, because hey, at one point or another, we've all wanted to be a superhero (even if you're a girl, you thought about ti at least once).

I can't call the movie flawless but per my opinion theres nothing I can call the movie out for; yeah everything and everybody did their job and they did it well, and I loved every minute of it. Put Simply, Kick Ass is one of my favorite superhero movies.

So, Great Story, Awesome Characters, and a Damn Near Perfect Exposition; The Bottom Line Is Looking Strong and it is a
94%- Executed with style, substance, and a flurry of terrific violence and an unbeatable sense of fun, Kick Ass is bolstered by excellent performances, a great script, and a completely and utterly original concept that will delight any and all who watch it.",1398211200,,2587,4.284836065573771
4024117,5,B002ZG9846,I can't say much without giving it away but the fumbling hero really finds some amazingly innovative friends to save the day in such a satisfying way. One of my favorite movies!,1398211200,,177,4.5625
4024238,5,B002ZG9846,this movie is one of my all time favorites. Nicolas cage actually has a good role in a movie for the decade. Also the girlfriend is hot as hell and you almost get to see her naked!,1398124800,,180,3.891891891891892
4024239,5,B002ZG9846,"I'm not going to review the movie. I love it. It is less flashy than some other Super Hero movies because this movie is based on RLHS (Real Life Super Heroes). There are [in the Really Real world- right now - probably in your own town if you at in a larger city] a bunch of people who ACTUALLY dress up in costumes (which are bullet proof and stab resistant) and patrol the streets at night. Same premise as the Watch Men (which is also loosely based on real people and events - minus Dr. Manhattan ). We have a few in Portland, Oregon. They typically record their patrols with Go Pro type video cameras and work with law enforcement.
Phoenix Jones is a minor celebrity in Seattle, Washington; he gets perks for being a voluntary public servant by many of the members of his community.
This movie helps explain how the RLSH movement started. Kitty Genovese was raped and stabbed while between 8-38 witness watched and did nothing about it in 1968. The criminal came back thirty minutes later and killed her. Some members of the community thought they needed to do something about the issue (known as the ""bystander effect""). Other people started similar things all across the country. The real story history of these people are fascinating. Their true stories are more outlandish than the movies sometimes. Worth looking into if you are into Super Heroes.

I can not provide external links; an internet search on ""the real life Super hero project"" or  ""phoenix jones"" will yield you some additional information. I work at a high school, and RLSH was one of the topics for english class. Enjoy :)

4025009,5,B002ZG9846,"Possibly one of the most violent movies I have ever watched (closest comparisons: Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill, and I can't even think of a third that's even in the ballpark).  Extremely well done.

A super hero movie without the sanitized romance of the mainstream, Kick-Ass brings a didactic story framed in a twisted morality play.

The Watchmen might be the better graphic novel, but Kick-Ass is the better movie of the pseudo-reality super hero genre.  Worth a watch, but only do so if your moral compass and ethos are well-considered and robust.  And did I mention this is one violent flick?  Choose with discretion, then enjoy, because this is one fantastic film.",1388966400,,672,4.955357142857143

This is a great movie for people that like action. This movie is very different from Spiderman, Thor, Hulk because the superheros

It lightly spoofs the hero genre, but should be taken as a serious movie on it's own.  Don't look for the allegory!  It will find you when it wants to be found.  Several moments of laughter, but also a few tears.  This movie isn't for young kids though.",1388793600,,383,4.25

4025014,5,B002ZG9846,"I actually thought it was a kid's movie.  I only saw tidbits of trailers in passing.  At best I saw one kid swear that was bleeped out. I got curious after I read a webcomic that depicting a grown man now terrified of little girls after watching the movie.

My 18-year-old and I watched it together on Amazon.  Loved it really, even the awkward parts.  However, this is definitly not a movie for kids.  Not for tweens.  And not for any sort of sheltered or semi- sheltered teens.  Probly not for a good number of adults either.

It's extremely violent, extremely bloody, and not just a little concerning that a little kid is playing one of the main characters.  Just pretending to do the things she did should send her to therapy for years to come.

Despite the blood and violence, it was very well done.  Which actually probly makes it worse because it was very believable.  There were no point in the movie where I was distracted by effects that reminded me it was just a movie. (Like most horror/thriller movies) The acting was great.  The story was realistic and more true to the nature of teenagers than any teenager involved movies I've ever seen.",1388534400,,1153,4.533980582524272

Then he runs into a father daughter duo (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz) who are doing the same thing, but are taking it to extremes he hadn't reached.

I did like this movie a lot. Moretz is shockingly funny as the dirty-mouthed, crime-fighting, child dynamo, Hit-Girl; Cage is just right as the father who's raising her wrong. They have a relationship that reminded me of The Addams Family. The only part I didn't like about it was the contrived romance between Dave and Katie. She seems a little too forgiving of his deception.",1388534400,3,668,4.808695652173913

One unlikely super hero, Kickass, starts the super hero scene, where he encounters the real deal in an 11 year old and her dad.

Don't want to spoil the rest, but it is a really fun movie that everyone will laugh at.

There is a lot of blood and violence.  Movie doesn't pull any punches (no pun intended) but that is better than the other actions films which are less 'realistic'. Definitely doesn't over glorify violence. Strong language that made my wife blush, but more in the beginning than throughout. Sets the tone for the movie.",1383609600,,693,4.647540983606557

A 4.7 out of 5 stars to be exact I would rate this at.

I only rated 4 stars instead of 5 because it's more a starting movie to a series that hopefully will continue. Yes... yet another trilogy? But it can't be helped. You will laugh. You will cry. You will yell YES! Kick his ass!!,1377820800,,320,4.262295081967213

After calling and them trying to help my problem tried to fix it but didn't get it and just hung up. Later I got an Email that said he fixed it and when I looked to see if I could get it. It was still the same and I never got anything in my Library. Amazon has gone Down hill and I've switched my streaming to redbox and netflix.,1377734400,,428,3.9310344827586206

Attempts by the writer/directer to spoof the batman TV series, (I guess to be silly/funny) ending up lame. And a world thats supposed to be based on reality having one of the most 'comic book' type villain (daddy) I've ever seen in an action movie (MR. Karate/Judo/Killem all) daddy. I could go on and on and on.
You really have to suspend reality to accept this world and the characters within it. But once you do.

even though it wasn't much what I expected, cause I was actually thinking that ""Kick-Ass"" was gonna be doing all the ASS kicking and have cool moves. But it appears that he was a novice and wasn't trained how to fight. But at least what made up for it would be ""Hit-Girl"" and her father ""Big Daddy"" those two actually kicked ass and mostly did all the fighting. Not to mention Kick Ass was saved by Hit Girl in that scene where it was a room full of thugs.

Overall I'm impressed and I'm glad I didn't regret buying this movie. I wanted to watch this because the second movie was on commercials and the commercial made it look like it would be AWESOME and it intrigued me. If I am to Watch Kick Ass 2 then pretty much I gotta see this first one. I hope the Second one is good as it was shown in the commercials.

That being said, I can't testify to its loyalty to the source material and it was impossible for me to be disappointed since I really wasn't expecting anything. It's rare to see a film like this with an R rating, and it's a hard R to be sure. I believe this gave the film makers the creative freedom needed to tell this story authentically, without having to compromise to achieve the PG-13. The casting is perfect, with each actor bringing his/her character to life. The action sequences are amazing, but so are the scenes that are dialogue driven. This film succeeds at everything it strives to be. The parts that are meant to be funny are funny, the action is done beautifully, and the serious parts really drive the story rather than slow it down. Everybody involved did an incredible job. Can't wait to see the sequel.",1376870400,,896,4.60625

4027420,4,B002ZG9846,"You know,the great thing about being an independent reviewer here at Amazon is that I don't have to follow the latest edition of the Hollywood Reporter,or be at the next L.A.soiree for the premiere of some movie,or attend the latest film festival in Timbuktu. Instead I may,or may not have heard some movie hype before hand,just like any other person. Well I did not hear squat about Kick-Ass(released Mar/10) except for it being shown at the local theatre where I live. So what a pleasant surprise to view a film that has combined the super hero genre with the human condition and wrapped it all up in a film with a big heart. It is NOT what you might expect,as this is one film that should not be judged by its derivative and simplistic title.
The film stars,among others,Aaron Johnson,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Chlo Grace Moretz,Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage.
The story finds an ex policeman who was framed by the local drug lord in New York City. He is back and has been slowly seeking revenge on the king pin who did him wrong,Frank D'Amico. In his preparation,he has brought up his pre teen daughter to be able to handle herself physically and mentally in dangerous circumstances. She knows everything from kung fu to shooting an AK-47,and everything in between. In a parallel plot we have a young high school student who fantasizes about fighting crime. He actually orders a form fitting blue uniform one day and starts his perilous journey,which has more than its share of bumps. When he confronts three bullies beating up on one man he becomes an instant You Tube sensation and his life and new moniker,Kick-Ass,turn upside down in an instant. His girlfriend tells him about some guy who has been hassling her and he goes to his apartment to warn him off. Instead he ends up getting a bad beating,but there is a sudden intervention. It comes from the ex cop and his daughter,who are Big Daddy(dressed like Batman) and Hit Girl respectively. They tell him that they will be around should he ever need his help.
D'Amico's son comes up with a plan for his dad,who blames Kick Ass for his problems. He asks him to buy him a tailored costume of his own,and he will assume the name of Red Mist. That way he can befriend Kick Ass and deliver him right to his dad. The plan goes better than expected when Red Mist gets Kick Ass asks to meet with Big Daddy and Hit Girl. When Red Mist enters the room he shoots Hit Girl who falls right out the window. Kick Ass and Big Daddy are taken hostage and paraded on camera,on line,before countless viewers,who will witness their execution. Both are beaten badly and just as the two are to be set on fire Hit Girl enters the scene and starts a one by one campaign of kick-assery. She rescues both,but her father succumbs to burns he suffered.
Back home Hit Girl is out for revenge. She and Kick-Ass take the fight directly to D'Amico's office tower and floor. Hit girl is a virtual dynamo and mows down all who oppose her,until one of D'Amico's henchman brings out a bazooka. Just as it looks like she's headed for heavens gate,Kick-Ass appears outside in a hover suit,loaded with two machine guns. He does some housing cleaning and saves Hit Girl. They finally get into D'Amico's office and while Kick-Ass fights Red Mist,Hit Girl takes on the don himself. Kick-Ass ad Red Mist fight to a draw,while Hit Girl is down and out and just about to receive the coup de' gras. Kick-Ass enters with the bazooka originally intended for Hit Girl and blasts D'Amico out the glass window. The film ends as Hit Girl has enrolled at Kick-Ass's school and we listen as D'Amico's son plans revenge.
This movie has multiple in jokes with past movies and its' soundtrack at times is very clever. For example,when we first see Hit Girl's fighting abilities the theme song to the old cartoon the Banana Peels,is playing in the background. As I said this film has a ton of heart and the girl's hutzpah,moves and,dare I say,language,are something to behold. She may be around 11,but she is more like 31 in attitude. Cage plays her loving father and at no time do we not know that. Although I should qualify that by saying when we first see the pair together,it is Cage firing rounds into his daughters chest at close range,so she can get the feel of what a bullet impact feels like. It tends to make you scratch your head and say,""wtf?"",but soon all is revealed. Oh,and she does wear a Kevlar vest at all times(dad taught her well!).
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,and featurettes on its making and art and the trailer.
All in all a VERY pleasant and surprising diversion of a film(I love it when that happens).It is a nice twist and mix of different genres and has great heart. I highly recommend Kick-Ass. And kids....don't try this at home!",1376697600,,4838,4.613689095127611
4027421,5,B002ZG9846,"I had originally dismissed this movie as being just plain dumb when i first heard about it. But just last year, something kept telling me to watch this movie. So finally I watched this after watching Scott Pilgrim. I did not like Scott Pilgrim like I thought i would, but after watching Kick Ass, I not only became a fan, but i completely embraced the idea of the movie. Kick Ass adds a lot more depth and poses the question: What does it really take to be a superhero?

Directed by the brilliant Matthew Vaughn (review for X Men First Class coming soon), Kick Ass stars Aaron Taylor Johnson as the titular character Dave Lizewski ""Kick Ass"" and he was excellent. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Chris D'Amico who later becomes Red Mist. He did a great job. Lyndsy Fonseca plays Dave's love interest Katie Deauxma, Omari Hardwick stars as Marcus Williams, Mark Strong portrays the villain Frank D'Amico, Nicholas Cage gives a very admirable performance as Damon Mcready "" Big Daddy"", and the person who I feel gave the best performance Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Mcready ""Hit-Girl"".

The story line is a whole lot of fun; albeit, there is a heavy dose of violence, and a moderate amount of profanity, but then again, this movie is rated R. Kick Ass is not like any other superhero movie in
recent memory. It does have its similarities with a FEW other superhero movies, but it is completely original. It has humor, drama, action, and the right amount of good in all 3 of its acts.  And yes, it DOES Kick Ass.

To close, I gotta say, I am not only impressed with director Matthew Vaughn and actor Aaron Taylor Johnson, but I am still amazed that after 3 years, this movie still feels like a new release every time I watch it. It is a great feeling when watching a certain scene in a movie, (that you have seen 1000 times) even when you know whats going to happen next, you still find yourself getting goosebumps. Whenever I watch Kick Ass, I still get those same goosebumps. It may not be considered ""epic"" or ""classic"" to everyone, but in my opinion those words fit this movie perfect. My review for Kick Ass 2 (and reviews on a slew of other movies) is on the way. I rate the movie Kick Ass:

I kinda remember glancing at the trailers when it aired on T.V., and, like I said before, I didn't think much of it. I just thought it was another cheesy kiddie kick-butt flick. It didn't register that you wouldn't think that they would name a film ""Kick-Ass"" if it was truly geared toward the kiddie population. A couple of my former co-workers who are movie buffs were talking about this flick after they had seen it at the theater, and they were raving about it. So, I said to myself, ""Maybe I ought to check it out"", and so I did. This movie definitely has it's share of bloody violence, foul language, and some sexual situations. Definitely not a kiddie flick, not something you would see on Nickelodeon. It's not one of the greatest movies I've seen, but it was pretty good. I might go see the sequel, it comes out today.",1376611200,3,920,4.449704142011834

Chloe Grace Moretz (as Hit Girl) was the real kick-ass of the movie.  Greatest ending scene is the two school bullies confronting Hit Girl at her new school.  Hope the upcoming sequel will live up to the original.  Saw this after ""Hick"" and before ""Let Me In"" and became a big fan of Chloe Grace Moretz.

I will most likely go see the sequel as well.  It's basically an action movie with a love story intertwined in it and some twists that may surprise or shock you.

4028066,5,B002ZG9846,"There is a lot of foul language and over the top violence in this movie.  It is also a movie that has a plot that is in no way believable, so it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.  So know up front, if you are one who hates those things in a movie, stay far away.  For everyone else, this is a movie that in part pays homage to the super hero movie and in part mocks it.  It has some dark comedic moments in it, but it is not really a movie that would be considered a comedy. The good guys are not necessarily all good but there are certainly clear good vs evil lines drawn.

The story is simple.  I regular guy decides to become a superhero, operating out in broad daylight.  He discovers that he is in way over his head, and that there are other superheros of the more clandestine nature who are far better than him operating to bring down the local mob boss' empire.  So it ends up being part superhero movie, part revenge story, and part nerd gets the girl.  I think the acting, while certainly not academy award quality, was very good, with Chole Grace Moretz stealing the show as Hit Girl.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, and there are some good, yet pretty standard bonus material including making of behind the scenes material, a featurette on the comic and artwork.

All in all, if the genre is in your wheelhouse, then you will probably enjoy the movie.  The bonus material is good, but not necessarily anything worth getting the discs vs the instant video unless you collect the physical discs.",1373760000,,1524,4.327464788732394

As the title says, it is supposed to be about 'Kick Ass', but it was 'Hit Girl' that stole the show. I watched Chloe Moretz in a few movies like '500 Days of Summer', 'Hugo', 'Dark Shadows' and people kept talking about her in Kick Ass in reviews and interviews. Watching Chloe as the, swearing and ass-kicking 'Hit Girl' was the best thing in the movie next to Nicholas Cage's 'Big Daddy'. She was is in nearly every action scene shooting and slicing bad guys.

4028618,5,B002ZG9846,"Let's get one things straight.
Best.
Movie.
Ever.
Spider-Man, Avengers, X-Men, everyone GO HOME. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are now in the lead.

This movie was hilarious, dirty, sassy, action-packed, and even romantic all at the same time. It had me rooting for the cahracters the whole time. Movies rarely get five stars from me, so this is an incredible deal. It is one of my favorite movies in the entire world and it will be that way until I'm dead in the ground!

Nice plot. Grabbing and never fuzzy. Excellent characters. You root for misfit Kick-Ass and cheer on show-stealing Hit-Girl from begining to end. And might I add, PERFECT casting. Aaron Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Nicolas Cage, Mark Strong, EVERYONE IS GREAT. And for Chloe, who's such a young actress, to be playing such a strong female character, she's incredible! Second favorite actress ever! (Behind Jennifer Lawrence, but let's not get into that.)

One problem: This movie was definitely over sexual. Anyone younger than fifteen should steer clear and, depending on your parents if you're still a teenager, look it up on IMDb to make sure it's ok. There's also some intense language and medium violence and gore, so check up on that on IMDb as well.

Long story short, if you love movies, heros, comics, or ANY of the actors in this film, (or perhaps all of these) then GO SEE KICK-ASS!",1369094400,,1384,4.851694915254237

I wouldn't pay for this one. Wait for it to become a freebie if you really want to watch it.",1369008000,5,429,4.308641975308642

However this is all looked over because of the great acting, script, and costume design. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age 14.",1368921600,,476,4.359550561797753

4028622,2,B002ZG9846,"I'm a big fan of the movie, so picking it up on Blu-ray for the discounted price was a no brainer. However, the practice of movie studios putting an expiration date on the digital copy of the film (one that is still available for purchase on iTunes I might add) is ridiculous. The code for the digital copy expired and Lionsgate will do nothing to resolve the situation. So the above rating is for the product not the movie. Not being able to gain access to an included feature just makes me feel cheated, regardless of the price. I'm going to keep the product because it was such a good price for the Blu-ray/DVD copies of the film, but this practice of the digital copies expiring is a reprehensible business practice that should be outlawed. It's for this reason that I either get movies through Netflix or buy them at a discount.

4028726,5,B002ZG9846,"I had wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer a few years ago. What looked to be just another ""by the numbers"" comedy turned out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.

This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for children, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.

As far as the violence involving the young actress who plays Hit Girl, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic and serious, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.

There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.

Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as ""Big Daddy"" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. ""Hit Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.

While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.

The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.

In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!",1367712000,,3713,4.395924308588064

I'm not familiar with the comic,so I cannot compare them. The trailer made it seem like it would be a fun superhero film for the family. Make no mistake, this film is not for kids.

The main character, Kick-Ass, I found to be decent. I found him very funny and relatable in the beginning. He fantasizes what we all fantasize about . We all want to be a superhero. The problem is that when Hitgirl and Big Daddy arrive, Kick-Ass easily gets overshadowed. That's a problem because he's the main character. Hitgirl is awesome! She is easily the best part about the film. Chloe Moretz does a great job for a young actress. Big Daddy is also a fun character. This is easily Nick Cage's best role in years. Red mist is okay as a sub-villian. The villian played by Mark Strong is okay, but nothing special.

The movie is funny and over the top, which is what the film is going for. So it does its job. The action scenes are fun and exciting.

Overall I enjoyed this film. I recommend this to any diehard comic book fan. Leave the kids at home though.",1366848000,,1167,4.368663594470046
4028731,5,B002ZG9846,"Kick-Ass is the name adopted by a teen-ager who wants to be a superhero.  He learns quickly that it's more difficult than he had imagined.  Nicolas Cage is an adult who is preparing his daughter to join him as a ""dynamic duo"" to get vengeance on the mobster who framed Cage for a crime.  What is interesting is that in a live-action movie about comic-book characters, the real-life story of the tragedy that befalls Cage's character is told in comic-book form.  This is simply an ingenious way to contrast the difference between what these superheros are trying to do and the real life that now eludes them.  Very symbolic, very imaginative way to get the point of the movie across.

It criss-crosses several moral lines, back and forth, and does not try to hide the complications, ironies or the quandry of neccessity. The top cop is crooked and ""the good guys"" are a lame, but learning, well-meaning teenager, a vengeful anti-hero and his highly trained, counter-assination level daughter (all of 11 years old).  Oh, and the villain?  He's a ""family man"" who really loves his teenage son - he actually wants him to ""eat his oatmeal"" and keep his nose out of the family business a bit longer while one of our heroes has made his 11 yr old daughter the central thrust of his vengence.

4029145,5,B002ZG9846,"At the outset of Kick-Ass we start with Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a very none-descript high school student, who has a couple of equally non-cool sidekicks. Their main interests other than girls, who are not interested in them, is comic books. One day Dave asks his friends why no one ever dresses up in a costume and fights crime for real. One of his friends points out correctly that if one where to actually try that they would get their ass kicked.

Dave is undeterred and buys a mail order costume. Eventually he chances to confront a couple of tugs trying to break into someone's car. Yes, he gets his ass kicked. Then he gets stabbed and hit by a car. When he gets out of the hospital and one assumes some physical therapy (not shown), he resumes training to be Kick-Ass his nom de guerre. In his next encounter with crime he fairs somewhat better and fellow teen's cell phone camera videos of his battle with street thugs goes viral on the internet. Kick-Ass becomes a household name. Some someone is even planning a comic book about him.

In a parallel story we learn that a former police officer spent five years in prison after being framed for drug dealing by mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) after refusing to become corrupt has also become a costumed vigilante. Damon Macready aka Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) has pattered his persona after Adam West version of Batman but with a lot less respect for the law. He has also recruited Mindy, his 11-year-old daughter, into his plan for vengeance. It seems she was a good learner. This duo has funded their operations by stealing drug money from the D'Amico street operatives and accumulated a $3 million dollars cash stash. In an opening scene we see on one such mobster being tortured trying to explain the he didn't take the money but someone looking like batman did.

David has had a crush on Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca). She was totally uninterested in him until a rumor spreads that he is gay. Being a liberal young lady, who volunteers at a needle exchange clinic, the idea of having a gay best friend appeals. Not exactly what Dave has in mind but he goes with the chance to be with her. A man she knows from the clinic named Rasul has been bothering Katie and she makes an off hand comment that she could use the helps of someone like Kick-Ass to tell him to leave her alone. Dave seizes the opportunity and soon finds himself is a sleazy apartment surrounded by several dangerous thugs. It looks like this is going to be the end for K-A when in comes Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who proceeds to kill these rather formidable thugs with some dispatch. Hit Girl is Big Daddy's daughter. This begins loose relationship between the duo and K-A whom they see as a hapless wannabe but as Hit Girl says with some potential.

Having seen his complete incompetence next to the duo, Dave has second thoughts about his life a super hero. But, unfortunately for him was misidentified by the mobsters has the individual responsible for deaths of eight of D'Amico's people and the theft of a lot cash. Enter Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), D'Amico's son, who has been spoiling to get into the business with a plan to get Kick-Ass. He assumes the masked identity of Red Mist pretending to be a crime fighter and fan of Kick-Ass. I'll say little more about the plot but that there is plenty of action to come.

Clearly Chloe Grace Moretz steals the show. Compared to Hit-Girl the Kick-Ass character is really out of his league even with his rally late in the show. This has not been without some controversy. Film critic Roger Ebert is appalled at the image of a merciless 11-year-old girl killing like its fun. Is this character credible? In fact are any of the super hero movies credible? Or, even most action movies for that matter? Also, I would point out the child soldiers in Africa as an unfortunate example of this possibility not to mention several school shootings in our own country. In fact that is what is disturbing about all of this.

Kick-Ass is a rather Tarantino-like flavor with allusion to Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Matrix, John Woo films, and others. This is a hard R movie and is not for children. It is very funny in places or very disturbing in others. Or, perhaps what is disturbing is that it is funny! Thus forewarned go and enjoy.",1360886400,,4321,4.605194805194805

The premise of this film seemed different from the rest, just as 'Watchmen' had been in the same vein but very different.  Since I had thoroughly enjoyed 'Watchmen', I thought I might also enjoy 'Kick-Ass' in the same way.  Well, I most certainly enjoyed 'Kick-Ass', but it was so much better than what I had expected.  Granted, there was more blood and violence than I expected, but that's not a problem for me.  The film had so much more action, comedy, character development, everything I look for in this type of film.  It even had Nicolas Cage in what I considered his best role in years, where he could go a bit over the top, but that's what the role needed.
Maybe this is yet another case of going into a film with lukewarm expectations, so the exceeding of those expectations is not a bridge too far, but I believe for pure entertainment value, 'Kick-Ass' delivered with a knockout.",1356566400,,991,4.634285714285714

The three of them are introduced after Hit Girl destroys a drug dealer's lair and its seedy denizens.  The drugs belonged to a mafioso who believes Kick-Ass is responsible and Red Mist fools him into a very bad situation.

4029832,3,B002ZG9846,We were expecting a light hearted funny movie that possibly met the humor of a SuperBad. What we saw was  a pretty dark and somewhat intense movie that was pretty entertaining. I ended up really enjoying it anyway. My wife on the other hand didn't appreciate it. Over all the acting was pretty good and worth a night at home...,1353283200,,327,4.45
4029833,2,B002ZG9846,"The idea of the movie showed great potential but the execution of the plot was poor.  A little girl being trained to be a heartless killer without care, what message does that send.",1353283200,,181,4.484848484848484
4029834,4,B002ZG9846,"Vulgar, crude and virtually without any meaningful dialog, this would be a typical summer movie if it wasn't for Chloe Grace Moretz, the ten year old Hit Girl with a mouth that would embarrass a sailor.  A teenage boy (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) decides to combat rampant crime in his city by becoming a comic book style hero he names Kick Ass.  With a scuba suit and two police batons sets out to fight crime and right wrongs.  Predictably, he gets the stuffing kicked out of him every night until he is mentored by purple haired Hit Girl (Chloe Grace) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage).  An apparent competitor in the hero game, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), uses Kick Ass to lure Big Daddy into an ambush.  Nicholas Cage is Nicholas Cage: Taylor-Johnson and Mintz-Plasse are so-so but Chloe Grace Moretz clearly displays an acting talent that will propel her to starring in the remake of Carrie only three years later.  The movie works as a story about courage but it didn't have to be so gross.  BTW, did you know that Chloe Grace Moretz has starred in four movies she is not, as of this writing, old enough to see (rated R)?",1353196800,2,1127,4.605
4029835,1,B002ZG9846,"I would probably give the movie a higher score if it weren't for Hit Girl and Big Daddy killing everyone.  Hit Girl is 10, maybe 12 years old?  Big Daddy, played by Nick Cage, is her father, who gives her butterfly knives for her birthday, and gets her into the vigilante business.  It a fantasy movie, I guess, but it's just so inappropriate.  I think Hit Girl stabs, slashes, and shoots more people in this movie than John McClain does in Die Hard.  In one scene, Hit Girl and Big Daddy have a gangster handcuffed in an SUV in a car crusher, and she pushes the button, while her dad looks on approvingly.  Big Daddy also racks up a pretty significant body count.

It's not that I'm advocating total non-violence in movies.  I understand the ironically excessive use of blood and violence in Kill Bill and Robert Rodriguez' movies, but it doesn't sit right with me when a father tells his young daughter that it's time to put away the homework for some 1st degree murder.

I know the movie is rated R, but it just aired at 5:30 p.m. on basic cable.  They censored some of the language, but not much else.

Pre-teen vigilante going around killing people?  Totally inappropriate.  Fail!  I really can't get past that, to find any redeeming entertainment value.",1353196800,9,1259,4.5625

Hit Girl made this movie great, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.
As a matter of fact I'm about to walk down to the nearest comic book store to see if I can find the comic related to this movie, if there is one.

The movie has a lot of things children should not see, or things in which children should be supervised if they are allowed to watch.
Overall, even with some of its questionable material, this movie has become my favorite super hero movie!",1350604800,,633,4.188524590163935
4030111,5,B002ZG9846,"Although ""Kick-Ass"" is undoubtedly goofy in nature, it has a surplus of something that the majority of superhero movies lack- heart. There is one scene, during which the protagonist is engaged in a battle to defend a man who is being attacked by three others. He is outnumbered, outclassed, and clearly in over his head. He takes a wicked beating, yet he refuses to give up, and he sacrifices his body for the sake of defending a stranger. One of the attackers, mystified by the protagonist's seemingly irrational behavior, asks of him, ""What's wrong with you?"" The young hero replies (paraphrased), ""There's three of you picking on one guy. And you're asking what's wrong with ME?"" This scene, stunning in its ferocity and courage, perfectly captures the heart that ""Kick-Ass"" possesses.

But let's not forget that this movie is also laugh-out-loud funny, particularly with the absurdities portrayed by the odd little man best known as ""McLovin"". Nick Cage's performance is also outstanding, but it's the young Chloe Grace Moretz, who is a force of nature, despite her diminutive size. I suspect (and hope) that she has a very bright future ahead of her.

""Kick-Ass"" is not only entertaining and fun, it also gets your heart racing, and stimulates thoughts about surprisingly deep subjects, such as bullying, society's oft questionable values, and the significance of family influences upon one's direction in life.",1350172800,,1416,5.125541125541125

Gonna keep this very brief, others can give u a synopsis from beginning to end; I'm gonna tell u in general what makes this show good & sets it apart from most films (ASIDE from the VERY good & ORIGINAL plot!).

Sometimes we have movies that we like but don't know/analyze why we like them; pace is really 1 of these things that we often consciously never think about (when pace is off, sometimes an otherwise decent movie, just doesn't ""sit right"" w/ us, w/ Kick-Ass, we don't have this problem ;) that makes or breaks a film.  Kick-Ass has unparalleled pace throughout; I've found that this seems to b the hardest thing for films to achieve (based on my empirical evidence ;), even most of my other favs don't have this down.  The filming of this movie (i.e. ESPECIALLY the camera angles, all that went into shot composition, casting, & usage of colors) was VERY well planned/thought out; all of this shows & that's why the pace is so exceptional.

You can pause ANYWHERE during movie & you've got a work of art!  There's so much visual interest in this Kick-Ass; the city, buildings, & rooms are all given good character & have personalities.

I love the story of Kick-Ass & I love the characters/their acting (I actually LOVE EVERYTHING about Kick-Ass;).  Superficially, this is A LOT of fun & great to look @ but on the less conscious level, this movie engages/keeps you there bc of how much you r seeing but also what u don't ;) aka BUY THIS, YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!",1350086400,,1670,4.396103896103896

First, like most comic book hero movies, it's a world populated entirely by psychopaths, and heroes and villains kill each other senselessly and mercilessly while teaching their children and their audiences that it's right to do so.  Second, the hero of this movie -- Kick-Ass -- as he calls himself is a dumb-ass, and it's hard to maintain cool and composure when he continues to make bad stupid decisions (he's more like a plot device than he is an actual character).

But despite its deep permanent inherent flaws ""Kick-Ass"" can be at times riveting and even cathartic.  What makes this movie sing aloud is ""Hit-girl,"" and there's something wondrous and inexplicably uplifting about a cute eleven-year old girl who dresses like a Japanese cartoon character yet is also a master assassin.

 Matthew Vaughn (Snatch, X:Men First Class) directed and had a hand in the screenplay for this film that sees a less than average Joe (in this case, 17 year old Dave Lizewski) decide to become a superhero to make the world a safer place and earn himself some respect. This is a stretch for Dave. He's a dork. His friends are dorks. The superhero suit he picks out for himself iscwell, you get the idea. Dave (played by Aaron Johnson) finally takes his act to the street where he is pummelled and caught on tape by spectators who would rather YouTube than help. The video goes viral, and Dave's alter-ego whom he names Kick-Ass, is born.

  Dave doesn't know what the hell he is doing, so enter ex-cop Damon Macready (Nicholas Cage) also known as Big Daddy, a man with a score to settle. Big Daddy's side-kick is his eleven year old daughter Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is a lethal assassin, not a country singer. When Dave gets in over his head with the superhero stuff, their worlds collide and they are forced to lend a helping hand or face death themselves.

  The movie is not of the Tobey Maguire/ Spider-Man genre. It is capital V for VIOLENT. It's charm comes somewhat from Dave, but mostly from foul-mouthed Hit-Girl, who winds up stealing the show and is worth the price of admissioncor rentalcor monthly fee. It`s not for everybody, but if you like the darker side of comic world spiced with a few laughs, you`ll like this movie.

You get the humor that makes a great comedy, along with the fights/kills that make a action movie. I wouldn't really say it's a superhero movie, but the concept is there. Nicolas cage and his daughter in the movie really make it come to life. You're going to love that duo. It's just not what you're expecting in a great way. One of those movies where when you first see it at times your, like ""Oh shit!"" and your really entertained. It's defiantly a must see for all ages 17 and up.

Aaron Johnson played his character well and Nicholas Cage was very funny.  Chloe Grace Mortez was unbelievable in her role as Hit-Girl.  The plot was good and there were a few turns that I wasn't suspecting.  After watching this movie, I purchased and read Kick-Ass (The Graphic Novel).  It was good, but not as good as the movie.

The movie has outstanding acting, excellent special effects, great costumes, and manages the impossible of making the audience buy into these super heroes.  Just to insure the audience gets that this is a spoof of all the over the top action movies out there, the real star is 11-year-old Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl.

While all the acting is first rate, Chloe turns in an absolutely brilliant performance blowing away, slicing and dicing more ""bad guys"" in one movie than occurs any three kung fu movies.  What's more it is done is such a brilliant manner the audience is able to suspend disbelief and enjoy the movie on several levels.

It is bloody, violent, vulgar, cute, funny and absolutely deserves 5 stars out of 5.  I think that you can expect to see a lot more from Miss Chloe Moretz, without whom I doubt this movie would rate 3 stars.  She is the movie, with a fine cast of supporting actors providing just the right support.  It may be Nicholas Cage who gets top billing, but make no mistake this is a Chloe Moretz's movie.",1336348800,,1097,4.589743589743589
4030630,4,B002ZG9846,"These days, it feels like you can't go 3 months without a movie based on a comic coming out. Usually they're the superhero kind, and other times you get something completely different like Oldboy or Sin City. I've never been a big fan of the superhero genre of comics or movies, apart from the ones that were meant to be entertaining and no much else. Kick-Ass didn't seem very interesting when I saw the trailer for it, and I hadn't read the comic either. I just watched the movie last night, and I think I'll be ordering the comic pretty soon because the movie sure won me over. Kick-Ass has just about everything I want in a good movie, and while there were two things toward the end that killed the moment for me, I have to say that it's one of the better movies I've seen this year.

Dave Lizewski is your average high school geek. He has no luck with the ladies, fantasizes about his [totally stacked] teacher Mrs. Zane, isn't even the funny one in his small group of friends, and spends most of his time at the comic shop or online. To make matters worse, he's constantly being robbed by two hoodlums in the neighborhood. During one robbing session, he notices someone observing the situation from their window. Rather than come down and help or call the police, the person does nothing, and this irritates Dave to the point of wanting to make a difference. He orders a scuba diver suit that looks kinda superhero-y, gets a baton for a weapon, and makes it his goal to become a local superhero: Kick-Ass. And wouldn't you know it, he just so happens to encounter the hoodlums pretty soon after getting his outfit. Things...don't go as well as he'd like, though he was off to a great start, and Dave gets stabbed AND run over, accidentally, by someone else who just drives off without helping him. The poor kid ends up in the hospital and comes out with messed up nerve endings and some enhanced bones. Rather than give up, he continues with the Kick-Ass thing and when he finally manages to bring justice to someone being beat up by 3 big dudes, it gets recorded and goes up on the internet, making him an instant star. But at the same time, there's a rumor going around of someone who looks like Batman...or just a superhero...messing up a local mob kingpin's business. Yep, Kick-Ass is in over his head, and it's going to take some people with much better training than him to set things right.

I was impressed by how well comedy, drama and action were all mixed together in Kick-Ass. The first quarter of the movie is comical, the middle is action-packed, and the final part has a lot of action with drama while still knowing when to throw in some humor. And my god was I happy to see that they had him fighting like someone who didn't know what they were doing and just brawling to their heart's content. I hate fights in movies that -look- like choreographed fights (think Tron Legacy's god-awful bar/club fight), but nearly everything here looked good. Even more amazing was Nicholas Cage giving a performance that wasn't bad. In fact, this could be the best thing I've seen him do in years. He does a terrific job as the Big Daddy character: a nice blend of loving father and revenge-driven psycho. Who knew? But, I have to agree with the majority here, when I say that the real winner of the movie is Hit-Girl. A little girl who isn't even a tween, cussing up a storm and literally shredding bad guys to bits with double bladed staffs, knives and more. Somehow, her character fits into the world of Kick-Ass, which sounds silly on paper but when you see it for yourself, it works. Had the movie been just about Kick-Ass himself, it probably would've gotten stale with the whole awkward superhero thing. Leave it to Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to keep things moving along just nicely. There isn't much else I can rave about without ruining some plot points. The cast and acting is solid all-around, even from Mark Strong and Mr. McLovin.

It's too bad that the final act is, in my eyes, underwhelming thanks to the big reveal of something Big Daddy and Hit-Girl order. Not that what I was expecting was much better, but when it's showtime, my shoulders drooped and I was let down severely. The climax is ruined even more by the use of a weapon. I won't say what, but when it's used, man...had that happened earlier on, I might have just turned the movie off because it was such an easy way to end things. So much for a big finish. And yes, I know this is a comic book movie, so it might've worked better in the comic, but on the big screen it looks goofy. Sorry.

Despite the below average climax, I had a good time watching it, and will be buying it sometime in the future. Kick-Ass deserves the money it earned in theaters (nearly 100m worldwide), and earns the R rating it has. How often do you see an action movie that could've been PG-13 if not for a few profanities? If you're sick of Spider-Man or like your heroes a little more realistic, go with Kick-Ass.

4030632,5,B002ZG9846,"Kick-Ass is the greatest comic book movie ever made.

I am writing this review in 2012, several years after Kick-Ass was released. I watch the film every three months. After this month's viewing I felt compelled to express my love for this movie. The superheroes don't have super powers but the slow-mo gravity-defying fights are fantastic, the themes are deep with lots of Shakespearian issues between fathers and their children, sexy wide-eyed girlfriends worship their nerd paramours, things blow up loudly, people bleed, people die, it's sad, it's funny, its deep, and it's all set to a loud non-cheezy rocking soundtrack. The writing is tight, the camera work is beautiful and the acting, especially Nicholas Cage, is world class.

Much has been said about Nicholas Cage's work over the last few years, most of it unkind. In Kick-Ass, as the super hero Big Daddy, Cage, a HUGE comic book fan, found the role that he wanted to play his entire life. I don't know how the producers got away with the exact duplication of the Batman costume, but it brings a whole new level to the proceedings, and Cage does not let the opportunity pass to play a unique, brutal, justice-seeking killing-machine. He grabs it and chokes it to death. Congratulations, Mr. Cage, on your stunning performance.

I just hope that there is no sequel to Kick-Ass, even though it certainly was set up that way. As a standalone film, it may not have made much of a ripple or made any money, but it had its own charming personality and it did set new rules (Why don't super heros bleed? Why not shoot the Joker?). It came on strong without any prior comic mythology to bog it down. Thanks to whoever took the leap of faith and put the huge amount of money up to make this wonderful film; thanks to all those who put in the hard and creative work photographing, writing, directing, acting and bringing this piece to life; and, finally, thanks to whoever remembered that comics started in a kid's bedroom, not a film studio's board room.",1334275200,,2008,4.715099715099715
4030633,5,B002ZG9846,"This movie is outright hilarious with tons of laugh out loud moments. It starts out innocently enough when a high school kid decides to dress up and act the role of a superhero. Things don't go quite as you would expect and the outrageousness just ramps up from there until the end of the movie. I felt that I was watching several movies because the mood would switch from quirky teen drama, to crime/mob boss movie, and of course, to superhero adventure. I think this structure provided a underlying seriousness to the movie that made the comedic moments even more heightened. The characters were awesome. From Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy (think Adam West as Batman, yet motivatedly cruel in combat) to Aaron Johnson in the comfortable nerdy main role, and finally to Hit Girl whose outrageousness is no doubt over-the-top, but is mainly the source for those get up out of your seat, laugh out loud moments.

4030746,5,B002ZG9846,"Kick-Ass is not a typical superhero movie-- it asks the question ""if you were a bored comic fanboy decided to become a superhero, how far would you take it?"" It's based on the comic by Mark Millar, although in my opinion it's better than the comic-- like most of Millar's recent work, the comic was extremely cynical and paints a very grim portrait of all the characters in it. The movie takes a more sincere approach-- one might argue that it's not as ""realistic,"" but hey, what's so realistic about a 10 year old girl in a superhero costume driving a meat cleaver through a criminal's head, anyway? If you are game for an extremely violent film about costumed vigilantes with no powers who have no qualms about killing the bad guys, then you'll love this. It's gritty, but at the same time it's got a great sense of humor and an odd sense of sincerity-- unlike the original comic, it ultimately sides with the notion that even though living as a superhero would take a serious toll on you and force you to do some rather questionable things, the superhero is still a noble ideal that can inspire people to be more than just another pebble in the road.",1329609600,,1153,4.495238095238095

4030748,5,B002ZG9846,"Kick-Ass is an adaptation from a comic book like Sin City,Watchmen.
At first before watching this movie,I did not take it seriously at all and the trailer wasn't very revealing as well. Looked more like a spoof of a superhero movie with two kids and Nicolas Cage as a middleaged man, looking like a very washed up superhero. Boy was I wrong. Also the ""R"" rating was a hint that this movie was gonna be explicit,and it sure was. This movie has everything,good story,comedy,action from hand to hand  to weapons. The villian in the movie is British actor Mark Strong, who has been in many movies like Revolver,RocknRolla,Green Lantern,John Carter. He plays an Italian New York mobster Frank D'Amico and his son Christopher-Mintz(Mclovin)looks up to him and one day wants to take over the bussiness.

  Then main two characters in the story are Aaron Johnson who plays the title character Kick-Ass and Chloe Grace-Moretz who plays Hit Girl. Chloe has got the be the best performer in the movie and the scene stealer as well. She shows energy,dedication and some good martial arts moves to the table. Nicolas Cage plays the father of Hit-Girl and is also a superhero known as Big Daddy. Big Daddy has been framed by Frank D'Amico and is put in jail for many years and is the cause of death of his wife.

  The movie itself is very realistic and the superheroes have  no superpowers like the Xmen or the Hulk. They use their intelligence to solve crimes. There hasn't been an ""R"" rated superhero movie like this since Watchmen,Sin City and the first two Blade movies. I haven't seen such a great supporting actor performance from Nic Cage in a long time. With this movie it put him back on the spot.

After the succes of Kick-Ass. Director Matthew Vaughn was chosen to direct X-Men First Class and that was another success from him.",1329264000,,1826,4.68125
4030749,5,B002ZG9846,"Boy does the movie live up to its title. This is an outrageous, over the top, super hero movie with realism as well. It' semi realistic because this is what would happen to you if you tried to just become a super hero one day; but, with some over the top, unique characters thrown in the movie.

The story is well written, and it brings the comic book to life. I found it to be believable because you would have this stuff happen to you (at least some of it) if you put on a costume and decided to go ""fight"" crime. This is a comedy movie, so unrealistic parts are not as noticeable. The action is over the top, and there is a ton of it as well.

The acting in this movie is well done. With the wide variety of colorful characters being portrayed in this movie, good acting helps with bringing those characters alive. The choreography the actors have between each other is professionally done, and you can tell they had to practice those moves out.

The location this movie takes place in is a city, which I believe is New York. The streets look realistic, with degradation and detail for all them. The vehicles are pretty cool in this movie. Especially the tuned up Mustang since this is my favorite car. The weapons used in this movie look believable, and work pretty well together with the actors.

Overall this is really cool movie, I laughed a lot.  I recommend picking it up if you enjoy watching a movie that's over the top and doesn't take itself too seriously. Because of this movie, I went out and bought a couple issues of Kick-Ass the comic.

4030752,5,B002ZG9846,"As most every movie fan can attest to there are times when high levels of anticipation can lead to eventual disappointment. Having read all the great early buzz for Kick-Ass I entered with the concern that this would be the case here. Those high expectations though turned out to be far exceeded. Kick-Ass is a fantastic blend of a comic book vibe with heavy action and explicit violence,  plenty of laughs, and genuine emotional pull.

Kick-Ass, based on the Mark Miller comic book series, focuses on a teenager who wants to make a difference by becoming a superhero. This is the real world though, he has no training and there are no super powers involved. Aaron Johnson takes on the role of Dave aka ""Kick-Ass"" who gets into crime fighting. He discovers there are more people out there like him but he is in way over his head.

Nicolas Cage is the biggest name involved in the film and he is terrific as ""Big Daddy"" both in how he delivers his lines and in his relationship with his daughter ""Hit-Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz. I really enjoyed her in one of my favorite movies from last year 500 Days of Summer but she is even better here in a much more significant role. Their back story and motivations drive much of the events of the film. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" the son of a mob boss and Clark Duke appears in a subdued secondary role as a friend of Dave.

Early on in Kick-Ass I was actually feeling a little concerned. It began in a juvenile-like comedic direction in setting up the character as he decided to become ""Kick-Ass"". Had it continued down that road it probably would have been enjoyable but nothing special. However it didn't take long until it really took off and I was hooked the rest of the way. The movie was able to remain funny while at the same time adding a gravity that captivated the audience.

Much has been made of the extremely violent and very graphic nature of the film. Despite knowing this going in I was actually caught off guard on numerous occasions. Even after the first few instances it kept getting me and based on the crowd reaction it seemed to be the case for everyone. There was often a unique mix of laughter and surprised response at what had actually happened on screen.

Throughout there is a very unpredictable nature which is incredibly refreshing. I enjoyed the absence of the usual cliches and in many cases events occured that I immediately noted as things that just don't happen in other movies. It accomplished a very real feel which fit perfectly with the general theme of the film.

One of the scenes that culminates in an action sequence in the final third of the movie may be my favorite ever. I tried to temper my reaction to it but it was incredible and given my affection for action movies that will tell you the regard in which I'm holding this. The scene was extremely intense, creative, very well directed and edited. There was a great deal of emotion involved given the situation at the time that I was literally on the edge of my seat. The music during the scene fit perfectly and really added to the tense nature of what was happening. The score throughout film really stood out to me as exceptional.

I felt a strong connection to the main character and his desire to do something more with his life. Who hasn't wanted to be a hero in some form or fashion? This emotional attachment to not just the characters but their plights was totally unexpected. In addition to that there was the distinct realization that these were all vulnerable people and that anything could happen at any time. The movie was actually really powerful and had that emotional edge that I had no idea would be present.

Rarely would I push anyone to see a movie but with Kick-Ass I've actively campaigned for it. See it! It is gruesome, action packed, funny and powerful.",1325462400,2,3837,4.565406976744186
4030833,1,B002ZG9846,This movie is terrible.  The only redeeming quality is the violence.  The violence scenes are really violent.  It's the sort of comic book type gore.  The rest of the movie was a waste of time.,1325030400,5,193,4.428571428571429
4030834,5,B002ZG9846,"I can't believe that I held off watching this movie because of all the reviews moaning about the blood and gore. Some review even said this took the violence a notch higher than Kill Bill. Really? What nonsense.

This movie is just awesome. I haven't read the comic book but the script, casting, acting, editing and cinematography are just brilliant. Not to forget, the selection of music is really creative. Speaking of creative, the direction is inspired and this helps the movie flow from beginning to end, scene by scene. I didn't even feel the romantic side-show was bad. What's a superhero without a love interest, right?

Anyway, if you were turned off from seeing this because of the reports of violence, give it a try. If you've seen any war film/fantasy film/historical war film/alien film this won't bother you. The action is choreographed very well and I nearly cried with joy when I saw the night vision First-Person-Shooter segment complete with the reloading animations and the ""Commando"" perk (FPS fans will probably get the reference). And the Good, the Bad and the Ugly soundtrack during the final act.

And when

Big Daddy is issuing tactical commands to Hit-Girl while being burned alive.

It's little touches like this that make the movie better than any superhero movie I've ever seen.

Anyway, the little girl really does deserve all the plaudits coming her way. Many complain that she should have received more screen time, but her lessened presence probably contributed to her swashbuckling persona. Aaron Johnson doesn't seem to be a favourite of the reviewers here, but he does a great job too.

4030838,4,B002ZG9846,"This movie is an exercise in sheer insanity. It's incredibly violent for one and the idea that a little girl (the appropriately named ""Hit Girl"" and played by an astounding Chloe Grace Moretz) could be portrayed as a sadistic murderess who undoubtedly enjoys killing bad guys in horrific ways is enough to offend anyone who can't see past the idea that it's not to be taken seriously. Her father, Big Daddy (played by Nicolas Cage in his trademark strange delivery), is another beast altogether. This film is a great take on the normal people thrown into extraordinary circumstances theme and while I personally feel the film loses it's way a little bit near the end, it's still very entertaining and worth watching. Aaron Johnson really nails the role of Kick-Ass and does a great job of making you root for him while Christopher Mintz Plasse is great as Red Mist as well. I'd think twice before letting little kids see this, in case you thought this was family friendly fare.

I would recommend this Blu Ray solely on the strength of the extensive making-of documentary included, which shows you in detail just about every facet of interest regarding the film's production. I was hooked once I started watching it and if you are interested in well made behind-the-scenes documentaries, I would gladly recommend this. It's long and exhaustive but really does a good job of showing what film productions are like and just how much of a risk on the part of the filmmakers was taken to bring this film to light.

If you like the film and/or the comics, do yourself a favor and pick up this disc as they did justice to it. The audio and video transfers are top notch and you get a good amount of content here to justify a purchase and addition to your library.",1323993600,2,1757,4.646302250803859
4030839,2,B002ZG9846,"When I started watching this movie I expected a movie that's not trying to say anything about superheroes and how they relate to society. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie seemed to be smarter than it's promise at the beginning, but when you really read into the film you'll find just how shallow it really is.
 As the movie starts out it seems to be a realistic commentary on what it would be like for a high-schooler to become a superhero, asking questions like ""Why hasn't anybody tried it yet?"" a statement which is flawed, considering that people HAVE tried it. The main character also states ""X-Men, Fantastic Four, they got it all wrong, it's not the superpower that makes a superhero."" another flaw, considering that X-men and Fantastic Four have NEVER said that the hero is defined by his power. The movie gets REALLY lame when Big Daddy and Hit-girl come in, two very unrealistic superheroes who kill every drug dealer/thug they come into contact with. It's hard to answer why so few are willing to take the mantle of a superhero for the main character when a ten year old girl is stabbing bad guys left and right. As for the main character(kick-bum), he's a teenage boy who is a terrible superhero whose biggest contribution to crime-fighting is taking out a bunch of thugs with a gatling gun on a jetpack. At least the movie has a good musical score.
 In summary, It's not the superpower that makes the superhero, it's the gatling gun jetpack.",1323561600,,1471,4.653846153846154

It's not something I would normally watch, but I have to admit I was curious about it based on the reviews.  I was so glad I picked this up.  This movie was fantastic; one of the best movies of 2010 by far.  There were some really stand-out performances by Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl) and Aaron Johnson (Kick Ass aka Dave).  Dave's two nerdy friends Todd (Evan Peters from American Horror Story) and Marty (Clark Duke) gave great comic relief.  I have to admit, I was really surprised by the level of violence, but not enough to be turned off by the movie.  It's definitely an adult movie; not for the kids.

Dave is your average teenage boy who loves comic books, hangs out with his geeky friends Marty and Todd, and has fantasies of becoming a super hero until he actually is one.  He gets himself into a lot of trouble and his new hobby soon becomes way too dangerous when he inadvertently pisses off a major crime boss.  He meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy when they save him from what is sure to be a death sentence.  In an attempt to gain his crime boss father's approval and bring back Kick Ass, Chris aka Red Mist pretends to be a friend to Kick Ass.  He soon realizes there is a much bigger threat to his criminal father's business and plans to take out Big Daddy begin.  This is when things get really out of hand.

4030968,4,B002ZG9846,"..But I'll get to that in a sec.  I thought this movie ruled on many levels, all having  to do with Hit Girl, Big Daddy, and the quality of the fillmaking itself.  This movie is incredibly violent - some people say the violence is supposed to be satirical, but I don't buy that.  Kick Ass the character is a lame-o faux superhero created by a dork high school kid who is fed up with innocent people getting screwed over by bad men.  He gets in over his head though and almost gets killed by thugs before his life is saved by Hit Girl and Big Daddy - a father daughter team of actual crime fighters who are attempting to bring down the city's boss of crime through the use of hard core no mercy violence.  Honestly Kick Ass is the weakest character in the film by a large margin.  He's a whiner, he's weak, he's stupid (gets easily duped by an obvious phony - the Red Mist); he's basically an idiot.  When he walks into a den of hardened, drug dealing, knife and gun wielding killers and starts talking big the movie almost sinks under the weight of it's own execution.  But then Hit Girl and Big Daddy appear and this film gets seriously awesome.  I thought the filmmakers decision to go ALL OUT with the violence was bold and refresingly different.  And yes I realize that it's kindof ridiculous to refer to ultraviolence as refreshing, but I'm tired of Hollywood's habit of pg13-ing their films for the sake of the the box office take.  Most superhero films suck because they are so vanilla and inoffensive that they end up being basically fluff.  The fillmakers on Kick Ass went in the exact opposite direction and made a film that probably had to be edited for content to avoid an NC-17 rating.  The one scene that genuinely disturbed was when Hit Girl brutally kills a fleeing woman.  But again I think my revulsion of that particular bit is overshadowed by my admiration of the filmmakers for having the guts to pull no punches in the realization of their vision.  There are action sequences here that are as good or better than any I have ever seen.  The plot twists sometimes don't make sense - there is a bit where Dave (Kick Ass's alter ego) pretends to be gay that really sucked - and Kick Ass himself is the film's weakest link but on the whole this film rules.  I don't think the filmmakers were trying to satirize anything, I think they were trying to make a good violent action flick.  Which they did.",1320883200,2,2416,4.425339366515837

4030972,5,B002ZG9846,"A lot has been said about this movie, so my goal here is to say just my little piece on this movie because I feel strong enough about it to do so. First of all this movie came straight out of left field, was not expecting the violence & ""Hit Girl"" character. I was not very interested in the title, found it uninteresting, never heard about it(bombed at the box office) & thought it was a kids movie. But like many, when it comes to superheroes, of any kind, there is some kind of draw & attraction so I went ahead & rented the DVD. O.K I won't be philosophical or anything but this is the truth, after watching the movie I was not the same, better or worse, mainly because of hit girl!. I was not sure how I fellt about her character. I finally decided that I was was in awe of Hit Girl. This type of character with the child standing up to the adults had been done before, but not like this! Obviously for those who don't see any positives being portrayed never saw that Cages character as a little insane. Yes he is insane with hate for the murder of his wife and his daughter's stolen youth because of it. He loves his daughter obviously & she loves him. But it's his insanity that allows HIt Girl to exist. His cop friend also is the voice of reason in the movie. But, just like us, he smiled when Hit Girl kicked the bad guys ass at the ""Kick Ass/Big Daddy Execution"".

Come on people, this is entertainment! How many movies can you say made such a controversy & like me made me feel changed for better or worse for just watching it. This Hit Girl character took guts to portray. Child characters that taunt & even kill adults is not new. Remember ""The Children"", ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"",& ""The Bad Seed"" just to name a few. At least Hit Girl was exterminating bad guys. Anyway, we all have choice. If you don't want your family to see this movie, check the rating before watching & turn it off if you get a surprise because you did not check the rating & investigate the movie before watching it, like me (I watched everything though about 4 times). The sequel should be called ""Hit Girl Kicks ASS""

I tried to be a superhero in high school by defending those who could not defend themselves, but I never had a costume or cool alias.  Kick-Ass (a.k.a. Dave Lizewski) is a teenage vigilante who becomes an internet sensation as a masked superhero.  His crusade attracts the attention of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big-Daddy (Nicholas Cage) who join forces to fight the powerful gangster, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).

This is a fast-paced, action-packed film that is a visual feast for the eyes with colorful costumes and brilliantly choreographed fight scenes.  The grotesquely violent scenes are portrayed in a satirical manner making them quite enjoyable to watch.  The music selection is an essential component by adding impact to high-voltage action scenes as well as depth to emotional scenes.

An eclectic cast of characters adds to the film's appeal because they are relatable and enviable.  Hit-Girl (a.k.a., Mindy Macready) is absolutely the best part of this movie.  She is a pint-sized, powerful avenger who slings guns, knives and vulgarity with ease.  All of this is done under the watchful eye of her doting father, Big-Daddy (a.k.a. Damon Macready).  The relationship between Mindy and her father is heartwarming, albeit unconventional.  There is something endearing and disturbingly funny about a little girl whose daddy teaches her how to take a bullet in the chest.

Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments.  This is a film about finding your true identity, breaking out of your comfort zone and taking extreme risk to earn great rewards.  Kick-Ass is a cult classic that will have devoted fans for decades.  I am definitely one of them!

4031101,3,B002ZG9846,"Basically as has been mentioned this is either a movie you will love or hate and I almost stopped watching after all the violence hit girl committed. I guess ratings have been relaxed since Kill Bill, a movie that has some similarities, was released. I thought some of the bloody scenes in Kill Bill were toned down with the use of black and white to get an R rating. Obviously, not required for this movie since you see all the bullet exit cavitation holes in glory detail in high-def so those without a strong stomach might get nausea watching this film. Anyways, if you can repress the repulsion at seeing an innocent way too young girl turned into a cold blooded killer like in Kill Bill, The Professional the visuals are very well done but that's about it. It seems as the write for the movie basically stole parts from the Matrix, Kill Bill, The Watchmen, Spider Man, Toxic Avenger, The Professional and make a mash up of them. Also, some references in the movie like MySpace, Lost, etc are already outdated thus making the movie stand the test of time even less. There was also some totally unnecessary masturbation and hot for teacher scenes at the start of the movie which added nothing to the movie. One of the problems I had with the movie is that it doesn't seem to make up it's mind if it's a comedy or not. I didn't laugh very much if it was supposed to be funny. I guess it must've been dark humor they were aiming for?
Ass-Kick is in reference to what the Watchmen Batman copycat Nic Cage says to his little girl. He tells her that Kick-Ass should change his name to Ass-Kick since all he seems to do is get his butt kicked LOL. Now that was funny! But then there are parts where the movie gets all serious and even depressing when one of the main super-hero's get killed and even Kick-Ass himself seemed to get physically ill as this movie almost made me feel when he saw all the death the little psycho hit-girl unleashed. He wasn't the only one, even Red Mist almost threw up, after seeing all the blood and guts in this movie! This should be an obvious strong warning to anyone sensitive to blood, guts and gore!
In the end I did see enough redeeming qualities in this movie to recommend it to those with a strong stomach.

4031183,4,B002ZG9846,"(I've never read Kick-Ass, so I can't speak to its status as an adaptation.)

From a technical standpoint, this is an extremely proficient film. It's shot well, the music is excellent (barring the fact hat some tracks are derivative of other works, which I didn't know at first), the acting is solid, the cast is all curiously sympathetic, the emotion is viscerally powerful, and the action is incredible.

For those who have never seen Kick-Ass and are unaware of its content, there are two things that should be made crystal clear.

One is , and please, PLEASE keep reading after this because it's not all there is to the movie:

This is exTREMEly violent. And I don't just mean that the violence is graphic. The violence is AFFECTING. I'm no stranger to violence in film, trust me, but every time someone was killed or even hit it felt like a slap in the face.

Second thing:

While the violence is extreme, none of it is gratuitous.

Does that sound nonsensical? Well, let me put it this way. Every single scene of violence serves an important narrative purpose. And I don't mean that it just moves the plot.

See, Kick-Ass is ABOUT violence. It's about how our glorified picture of violence doesn't hold a candle to the true, graphic horror of it. The main character, a kid who thinks he can be a superhero, soon realizes why our fantasies about superheroes can be childish and even dangerous. And every scene of violence is another step in the main character's voyage of maturity as he discovers this awful reality.

To be frank, I liked the main character. I identified with him, in a way. He has a sort of courage and ambition that you just have to envy. And that was a strong part of why this movie affected me so deeply: it projects you into a movie, then proceeds to beat you up, stab you, cripple you, and do the same to others in front of you.

I'm going to suggest something that's likely very false and maybe even irresponsible, but maybe I'm on the right track.

I want you to expose people to this film.

See, the big complaint with violence in film and games is that it's desensitizing: by distancing children from the horror of violence even as they passively or actively participate in it, maybe it makes them less horrified by the true evils of the world.

I don't personally believe that, at least not in the way most critics of violence do. BUT:

THIS FILM IS NOT DESENSITIZING.

No question about it. Every moment is raw, painful, horrifying. But the reason it's horrifying is because it isn't pointless, and although it's shot well it isn't shot in a detached manner.

In a way, it was almost a religious experience for me. Suddenly, I could see what people meant when they were complaining about violence in film. I've since become much less tolerant of gratuitous violence in films, but I'm still in awe of this one, PRECISELY because none of the violence is gratuitous to the main idea of the story.

As I said, from a technical standpoint the film is just fine, though the tone shifts so wildly that I'm not even sure what you're supposed to feel at the end.

I will raise one VERY annoying issue, though: the main character is mistaken by his crush for a homosexual, and uses this as an excuse to spend time around her. My problem has NOTHING to do with the homosexuality, but with the girl herself. See, during this time, the main character does things with the girl that, shall we say, she would consider much too intimate for interaction with a straight friend. Nothing sexual, but physically intimate. And when he finally confesses the truth, she's upset for about five minutes before she abruptly jumps to being his girlfriend.

I'm not a woman, but as soon as I saw that I knew in my gut that NO girl would react this way - certainly not within that time span.

This is something that intensely gets on my nerves, and here's why: because someday, something similar might happen in real life - and when that girl is rightly outraged, people might say ""Ah, you're just overreacting.""

I'm not going to blame this movie for starting a trend or corrupting our youth or anything, but to spread these kinds of ideas WITHOUT being aware of them is just not the way to go. If nothing else, it's just astoundingly poor writing - a lite version of the idea that wives can't be raped.

Stuff like that really irritates me. I can still watch Kick-Ass because I'm essentially aware of it and can tune it out. But please, PLEASE, make sure that people are aware of that particular problem. Just...stay aware.

And that's really the point of watching Kick-Ass, in a way. It's an exercise in raising awareness. Mainly it's awareness of the true horror of violence and the nature of violence in today's society; but hopefully it can also be an example of how these unthinking mistakes can slip past our radar somehow.",1310515200,2,4836,4.5717592592592595

But what is disturbing about the show is/are: (a) Having a teenage boy with no special ability who exposes himself to gang violence, and always getting injured.  That's illogical (b) Having an eleven year girl being trained to kill thugs with a smile on her face.  That's disturbing.

Some might argue that either scenario is fine as long as the villains are punished, but I think tarnishing the youths' lives to do so is just thoughtless.

4031295,4,B002ZG9846,"This was entirely not what I thought it was going to be.  Admittedly I had barely seen any previews and just new it was about some teenager pretending to be a superhero, but I thought it would be a comedy along the lines of Scary Movie, or Napoleon Dynamite.  I was wrong.

Dave Lizewski is your normal average geeky kid.  Until he gets the idea to become a super hero that is.  Then he becomes a little bit more.  But being a super hero isn't all its cracked up to be when the crime starts fighting him back.  And then new super heroes start appearing on the scene, all with different agendas.  Dave feels a little over his head but can't help but get drawn in.

Characters:
Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass-Aaron Johnson
Damon Macready/Big Daddy-Nicholas  Cage
Mindy Macready/ Hit Girl-Chloe Moretz
Chris D'Amico/Red Mist-Christopher Mintz-Plasse
Frank D'Amico-Mark Strong
and others...

Nicholas Cage has his ups and downs for me, but I actually liked him in this.  I thought he did a great job and liked the voicings and expressions he used for his character.  It added to the comedic value.  Chloe Moretz as his daughter was also very good as well.  She plays quite a controversial character (young girl killing, swearing, etc.) but made it very believable.  That being said, the main character played by Aaron Johnson didn't really do anything for me.  He was important to the film but I thought he could have been better.  As it stands, I didn't really care what happened to him.  The bad guys weren't exactly intimidating either.

As said before I had expected this to be more comedy.  While it was to an extent, I would peg it more action/adventure/drama because it did have a lot of serious parts.  Because of all that adventure though, there is a lot of gore and murder in this movie.  Those with faint constitutions may want to think twice before watching.  There is a lot of cussing as well.  For a plot I think this one was actually pretty good.  The movie has a point when it asks why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.  A downside though is that the pacing is rather poor and this movie, despite being an action film, kind of dragged for me and spent to much time on irrelevant details.

Not the best of movies but not the worst either.  I'd probably rate it 3.5 stars in total.

Well written, well done in every way.  It's a kind of dark action comedy with a ""we ain't gonna take it anymore"" theme.  A misfit nerd and little girl take on the forces of evil.

I can't sit through ""Iron Man"", any of the Hulk movies, ""Sin City"", ""X-men"", or anything remotely connected to comics, yet this will probably become, next to ""Love Actually"", my most-watched film.

I want the sequel now!",1306886400,,599,4.247787610619469
4031297,5,B002ZG9846,"There are a lot of live action comic book movies out there.  Some, like Nolan's Batman movies are deadly serious epics about ethics, corruption, organized crime, etc...  Others, like the Spider-Man franchise with Tobey Maguire, and the Batman movies of Tim Burton, incorporate some humor via dialog and action.  Then there those like Iron Man where the main character itself provides the comedy by trying to be funny in the movie.  But never has there been an absolutely outrageous and hilarious comic-book movie like Kick-Ass.  From start to finish this movie is loaded with laughs of all sorts.  From slapstick action scenes to sarcastic dialog to ludicrous outfits, all accompanied by fast-paced music, this is the funniest comic book movie I have ever seen, and one of the funniest movies released in 2010.  But don't take your children to watch it.  This movie earned its ""R"" rating on many counts.  With bad language, some nudity, and a lot of bloody violence, this movie, which features more children than most movies, is certainly adults only.

For those wanting to know what this movie resembles, I would answer ""Kill Bill"".  Both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass are titled after a male character in the movie, even though the principle character in both movies is female.  In the latter case, it is a pre-teenage girl.  In both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass, it is the female character that has the most action scenes, and the most kills.  And in both movies, most of the main characters have nicknames.  Other common threads are the excessive violence, large body count, gritty action, iconic musical score comprised of pop hits, and the theme of revenge flowing throughout.  Kick-Ass came in the same general time frame as other comedy movies about average people trying to become superheroes, movies such as Super and Defendor.  A sequel is in the works, so it looks like we have a new genre of not-so-superhero movies coming to Hollywood.  Overall, a great movie; and my vote for best comic-book movie of 2010.",1306627200,,2008,4.890532544378698

It's got a shocking amount of blood, shocking language, and at least one actor that verges on child-porn, at least in the eyes of some.

Very well written, has interesting characters (even the villains, who are cliches, are interesting), and a wildly skewed take on everything from teen nerdiness to who's really the baddest ass.

4031499,4,B002ZG9846,"That's the way you make a movie. You aim to do something good, you put your credibility into play, you assume that art is what you are dealing with, a phisical (audiovisual) manifestation of your soul.

This is a good movie, one that takes a good plot and develops it narratively and aestetically convincingly. I find it very sad, trully heartbreakening, when a film that could, and therefore should, become something interesting, is spoiled because of marketability issues. When all the ingredients are good quality, and the budget is big, there is sort of a moral obligation towards the world. For instance, Transformers II is a bad, bad movie, an offense to the world. And by the way, not only in terms of artistic dignity, but also in its comicity, in the way it employs silly stereotypes and topics regarding homosexuality, masculinity, female roles, and how non Americans are and live.

Nevermind the last sentence... I enjoyed Kick-Ass. The story is not particularly complicated, it's pretty straightforward, but it is catchy and is a perfect scenario for interesting and funny characters. The aesthetic vibe of the movie is also nice, it deals with a lot of violence, maybe a bit more than necessary, but it does with dignity. I like the bad words, the badboy and badgirl attitude, and the references to pop-comic culture. I didn't like the ""American Pie"" or teen movie elements, but it is a little concession to ""marketability"" that I am willing to accept. So, because of this last reason, and also because it is not a life changing or even a very ambitious movie, I am giving it four stars instead of five. But, hell, you do things the best you can, and you keep them simple in order not to fail at delivering more than you are able to. That's the way I like it, and I believe that if everyone in the world or cinema stuck to that rule, we would be celebrating masterpieces more often.

I have seen a lot of comic book movies in my time and I have to say this is one of the best that I've seen. There is a whole lot of action and comedy to please just about anyone.

The movie follows a young outcast high school boy, as he decides to change his life, by becoming a Super Hero, complete with outfit and all.  However, his first confrontation doesn't turn out so well, when he is stabbed and beaten to a pulp.  Though that doesn't seem to deter him from trying again, after he mends up from getting out of hospital, which is when he meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the real take-no- prisoners-crime-fighters of the movie.  And Hit Girl, is awesome!  But it doesn't take long for the bad guys to find the newest Super Hero, and mistake him for the one damaging their business, when it was really Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  So the battles ensue, with a final blow out battle and somewhat happy ending.
It was a great idea for a story, though I felt the movie fell short on delivering the story to screen.  I did like think the idea for the story was unique, as was the inclusion of the comic book story as a way of depicting the story.  It has some fantastic action sequences in it for sure!
Though, it wasn't as funny as it could have been, in my opinion, or as witty.  Nor did I find the characters as compelling, as I wanted or hoped for them to be, which leads me to believe that the writing was a little lacking in character development, as well as story.
I'm fine going to a horror movie and having some gore.  However, this movie, had way too much for my tastes.  And I don't believe it really needed the gore in it, to make the point or be visually entertaining/interesting.
If you're looking for action and gore, with some humor, this might be just the ticket.  Otherwise, if you're expecting a really funny movie, and a great story, you may want to pass...
It was somewhat of a let down for me, and one that would not be included in my library.",1294012800,5,1927,4.249315068493151

4031811,5,B002ZG9846,"I like the idea - why don't we be like our superheroes? Well, the whole costume thing might be a bit much for most of us but still a great kernel for a story line. In this seminal story arc, the main character gets wrapped up in the battle for good versus evil and finds out he is in way over his head after it is too late. What happens? he has to step up and put himself to the test.

It is a story about comic book readers for comic book readers. It can be a little gory at times and Nick Cage... I just don't get it. He was OK in parts but I had to think a few times about what he was doing before I realized he was trying to do a bad imitation of the Adam West TV Batman. I think it was an intentional bad imitation. If so it was the deepest thinking the movie had. Very raw and up front; good guys that are flawed and good. Bad guys that are flawed and bad.

I went with the Blue Ray / DVD / Digital copy version and love it. Easy to transfer that digital version to your media device and the extras are great. Watch the extras to gain an appreciate for the authors and artists that worked on this project. A bunch of guys dedicated to the story and lets hope they run with it.

Worth your time and hey, it is a set up for the next movie. Next, next and next! keep them coming.

Wow, it is amazing.

Cage is quite good but the star is Hit Girl.  She pulls it off incredibly well and you actually think that little girl can pull off what she is doing.

4031816,5,B002ZG9846,"Dave Lizewski (Johnson) is an ""invisible"" high school student. His day-to-day life is underwhelming. He lives alone with his father and spends the majority of his time hanging out at a comic store with his buds. The pivotal point in his life is when he asks the simple question, ""Why hasn't anyone tried to be a superhero?"" From here, Dave decides to buy himself a scuba suit and answer that very question by creating his alternate persona...Kick-Ass.

The film is based on a comic book series of the same name from author Mark Millar, who has also had a hand in The Ultimates, Marvel Zombies, and the recent Civil War story arc in Marvel Comics. While I haven't read the series myself, I'm told that the film adaptation is a nice translation which holds onto the core of the comic books.

It's within this translation that we stumble upon my first, and possibly only, gripe with Kick-Ass. Being a huge fan of Batman and all things in the respective Bat-universe, I was very upset to see such a blatant rip-off of the Batman costume being worn by Big Daddy. While other costumes in the film are at least close to their comic book counterparts, Big Daddy is nowhere near close. What we get instead is imagery of a Batman-looking character blowing people away with a variety of firearms. This upsets me for two reasons: 1) Batman doesn't kill. 2) Batman doesn't use guns. I don't know if the filmmakers were trying to piggyback on the success of the recent Bat-films by creating this parody costume, but I for one am not a fan of that decision. Not only does it use Batman's likeness in an inappropriate way, but it takes away from the originality of the character, as the audience will constantly be thinking ""Batman"" while looking at Big Daddy.

That said, there really isn't much else to complain about with Kick-Ass. I think most people saw the previews and went in expecting a superhero comedy spoof, but that's not what they'll be getting. The movie straddles the line between spoof and superhero fantasy. At times, we're looking at the goofy side with Kick-Ass himself and Red Mist. At other times, we have a more traditional superhero narrative going on with Big Daddy and Hit Girl. It's the blurring of this line that makes the movie so intriguing.

The characters were very fleshed out. There were many times during the movie where my heart was racing as I feared what their fate might be. The action sequences are fantastic. While bordering on ridiculous at times, the film sets a tone and stays with it the whole way through. The clear stand-out here is Hit Girl, played by Chloe Moretz. Her performance is so spot on that you'll actually believe an 11-year old girl is capable of that mentality and ability. There are lots of critics and naysayers out there complaining about the treatment of Hit Girl in the film. She's crude, incredibly foul-mouthed, extremely violent while showing little remorse, and receives her fair share of abuse as well. The critics claim that this is inappropriate and will send bad messages to a younger audience. I'm sorry critics, but in case you didn't notice, the movie's rated-R. A younger audience shouldn't be seeing this. It's called personal and parental responsibility. The same kind of responsibility people should have been showing instead of bringing their children to see South Park: BL&U just because it was a cartoon. Did Hit Girl's role in the film make me feel uncomfortable at times? You're damn right it did, and that's what the movie wanted you to feel. Huh, look at that...art making people feel emotions...what a concept.",1293494400,2,3583,4.755627009646302

4031851,4,B002ZG9846,"I had no intention of watching this movie.  I've been a diehard comicbook fan since childhood and thought that it would denegrate the genre.  I have to give the movie it's due, in no small part because of Nicholas Cage, Chloe Moretz and Mark Strong.  Matt Vaughn does a good job of holding this film together because it could easily have unravelled at any number of points.  It's still a spoof on super heros and in that respect, I'll always be a little dismayed.  On the otherhand, one has to smile ruefully at the idea of a kid like Aaron Johnson going out and taking on the underworld -- as if any middleclass kid would even know where to find them in the first place...  If there is one thing about this movie that really bugs me -- admittedly my own hangup -- it is the depiction of Chloe Moretz as a cold-blooded killer and a ""good little girl"", much the way that Natalie Portman was portrayed in The Professional.  It's more than a bit unnerving to see an 11 year old girl shooting, hacking and stabbing people to death as nonchalantly as if she were taking gym class.  I know that it's integral to the part in this film and can't really be avoided, but we sit amidst Columbine, Virginia Tech and any number of other teen driven multiple homicides and it makes me cringe more than a little that this movie glorifies that kind of revenge driven violence even for pre-teen girls...  By the way, in case there are any women out there who think my objection has to do with the fact that Moretz and Portman are women, you're off base.  I have flinched just as much in the depiction of boys of the same age acting the same way.  I'm a proud NRA member, but that doesn't mean that we have to make our children numb to the actual affects of committing this kind of violence, nor should we glorify such violence especially when it's portrayed by children.  Okay, off my soapbox.  It's worth watching, but not with your children.",1293235200,,1926,4.406779661016949

4031853,4,B002ZG9846,"Matthew Vaughn instantly made my top five directors after viewing this film.  His stylization, instinct, and control over musical score is what contributed to a great film.  He will go on to make many more awesome movies, and I intend to view his earlier work.

With that being said, Kick-Ass is near-perfect.  Everything about the film is great, but I have one bone to pick with the casting.  I really wanted Chris Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist to work.  Sadly if failed in nearly every one of his scenes for me.  I read the comic, and maybe I expected too much.  But after thinking about it, I realized that Chris doesn't do justice to the comic or the film.  Red Mist needed to be more sleazy and bratty, instead of goofy and sympathetic.  Kick-Ass could have been so much more if the Red Mist role wasn't so satirical.  I've seen Chris's work in Role Models as well as Superbad and I am aware of his expanding potential.  It's just too bad he didn't differentiate enough here.

Besides that little bugger, I enjoyed Kick-Ass thouroughly.  I put it about even in enjoyment with the comic, and both versions have their pros and cons.  I watch this film for: Nic Cage's amazing performance, Aaron Standford's perfect interpretation, the versatile and awesome fight scenes, top-notch writing, and the fresh/original style of the film.  The final two seconds of the film makes me cringe with dislike, but the previous portion of the film is fantastic.  It is a shame that Kick-Ass didn't get more recognition, because it's better than most films out there.

On blu-ray, Kick-Ass rocks!  There's a reason why it topped the charts when it first came home, and that's because it's an essential to any blu-ray collection.  No matter what type of audience member you are, there is plenty of room to enjoy Kick-Ass.",1293062400,,1803,4.717948717948718

4031933,5,B002ZG9846,"Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS is adapted from a comic book from the same name. Seems like there are tons of movies being made from comics these days, and, except for Spiderman, Superman, etc., I imagine the vast majority of film-goers aren't familiar with the comics these movies are based on.

For a movie like this to be successful, it has to appeal to the non-comic book fan. To me, Kick-Ass is an awesome movie, a great superhero origin tale. High school nerd Dave Lizewski  has always dreamed of being a superhero. So, one day he buys a costume, puts it on, and then goes out to fight crime.

There are a lot of things to like about the movie. I enjoyed the pulsating soundtrack set to scenes of gory, stylized violence. I loved the cast. Nicholas Cage is at his best. Clarke Duke is the funny sidekick. Mark Strong is the great villain. Lyndsy Fonseca is the beautiful girlfriend. Aaron Johnson even shines as Dave/Kick-Ass. Chlo Grace Moretz, the young teenager, playing Hit-Girl was the surprise of the film, as well as the center of controversy. Seems some people didn't care to see a young girl get beat up, use foul language, and kill dozens. Come on, lighten up. This is a fun movie, not to be taken seriously.

Movies like Kick-Ass are so much better than some of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days. Because of the extreme violence and bad language, this movie isn't for everyone. But, its funny, clever and a lot of fun. I can't wait for the sequel.",1291075200,,1469,4.553030303030303

4032157,5,B002ZG9846,"This movie is not for the easily offended, or those who want to impress people by their deep moral values and look down on those that realize that this is just a MOVIE and that it's intended as entertainment. In my opinion, most comic book based movies suck, so I had very low expectations for ""Kick Ass"". I thought my fears were justified until Big Daddy and Hit Girl appear on the screen. What makes this movie memorable, and the reason why ""Kick Ass"" will remain a cult classic for years to come, is those two characters.

Big Daddy is a mentally disturbed man, set on revenge, whose idea of showing love for his daughter is to fire low velocity bullets at her while she wears a bulletproof vest instead of high velocity rounds. He molds Hit Girl into a remorseless killing machine who can also swear like a sailor in a Manila brothel. Despite the patent immorality of Big Daddy's education of his daughter, his love for her, and her devotion for him, are never in doubt. Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz make the loving relationship between the two believable despite the obvious disfunctionality of the family.

Although the movie is called ""Kick Ass"" after the titular hero, Hit Girl is the real superhero of the movie. She steals the picture from the first scene she is in. Despite her cussing and murderous ways, Hit Girl is still just a little girl at heart, who just wants to please her daddy. She is not immoral, because she has been raised with a different set of moral values. The violence she perpetrates is over the top, and at times is creative. You will see ways of killing criminals you have never seen before. Hit-Girl has been vilified by crusading movie critics, but she will go down as one of the greatest anti-hero movie characters ever. She belongs with ""The-Man-With-No-Name"" played by Clint Eastwood, and ""The Terminator"" played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a ruthless and amoral character that you actually cheer for.

I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I'm actually looking forward for the sequel.",1289347200,9,2031,4.6834733893557425
4032158,3,B002ZG9846,"""Kick-Ass"" was entertaining and fun.  However, I wanted something a little different than what I got.  I wanted something over the top and fast paced.  Instead, ""Kick-Ass,"" while certainly over the top, is not fast paced at all.  Rather, it is two completely different movies shoehorned into one, that are only tied together at the very end.  The first movie is the story of a schlubby teen who becomes Kick-Ass out of a love of comic books and sense of idealism.  The second movie is the story of Big Daddy and his daughter Hit Girl, who are far more successful superheroes.  Oddly, the story of Kick-Ass is less serious than the story of Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  ""Kick-Ass"" suffers from jarring tonal shifts as well as a very slow moving first act.  If you can wade through the first 20-30 minutes, the better stuff kicks in.

However, at 2 hours this movie was too long for its own good.  The length is attributable to the fact that there are two different jammed-together stories to tell.  Paradoxically, even with the 2-hour length, the narrative seems thin and not fully fleshed out.

Hit Girl is awesome, and is without a doubt the best part of this movie.  I would have preferred that the movie be called ""Hit Girl"" and that it was 90 minutes with her.  That's one sequel I can enthusiastically await!

""Kick Ass"" is at least worth a rent, but I doubt you will want to own this unless you are a comic book movie completist.",1288828800,,1431,4.509727626459144

In Gunslinger Girl you are supposed to feel bad for this girls much like one does for child soldiers. In Kick Ass Hit Girl is portrayed more like a hero than a victim and imo that's just plain wrong. Also the entire movie is just absurd. Unlike in Gunslinger Girl, Hit Girl's physical abilities are not augmented at all so her being able to do a lot of what she does is likely impossible. Anyone feel free to contradict me with medical evidence but I highly doubt any 12 year old can take out a bunch of trained men 1'+ taller than her and 100 lbs heavier.
Furthermore the entire idea of the character Kick Ass is ridiculous.

I like the outline of the story. It has it's funny moments, but corny as well. Was it intentional for Mr. Cage to talk as if he were Adam West(Batman)? That didn't bother me. What really bothered me was the sexual content. No nudity, but there surely wasn't any honorable courting being done by the young main character and his dream girl. I can almost live with the little girl swearing worse than a pirate, but is this the kind of stuff you want your children to view as a good role model? The action portion was good. And the ending... made no sense to me. Yes, I know there will be a sequel. Read on. I didn't care for the taking of Hit Girl and placing here into a school. Was this film purposing trying to give ""homeschooling"" a bad name?  It also doesn't make sense to put someone outside of the system and put them in it. I bet they never thought about that.
In short, if you are looking for cheap ADULT entertainment flick, this will suffice.
I wouldn't look for this to be any good moral teaching masterpiece so keep your young one's eyes away.

P.S.  I am not a prune nor do I have any children. I just prefer good acting and action without the invasion of perversion with language and sexual innuendos.

I haven't enjoyed a comedy/action film recently as much as I enjoyed Kick-Ass. It definitely lived up to expectations. And as much as I love random, no-thinking-required comedies, this one actually had a few good messages, and when you add in a Sin-City-ish ton of blood and a badass eleven-year-old,  you've got  a little something something.

Don't get me wrong, it's probably going to rub you the wrong way from the start. I mean it's totally warped. You've got a father shooting his kid in the chest so that she can get used to the feeling of being shot (although later on we learn that he used ""low-velocity"" bullets...awww). Said kid swears like a sailor and kills bad-guys like a tiny ninja without blinking an eye. She reminded me of the school girl in Kill Bill. So it's probably going to scrape against what's been ingrained into you as socially acceptable because it really isn't on many levels - little girls shouldn't be foul-mouthed killing machines for one. That aside, it was a pretty good flick, but you have to put yourself in the mindset of Kill Bill. It's going to be gory and off-putting but it's going to be cool in its own sick twisted way.

So what's Kick-Ass about? Dave is an ordinary high-school boy, more of a nerd than anything, and he asks the question of why don't more people try to help others. Why aren't there more real-life superheroes? After being mugged and bullied, he buys a costume online and tries to defend people, calling himself Kick-Ass. The first time he gets completely  creamed (and stabbed) ending up in the hospital with all kinds of metal in his body and messed-up nerve endings. The second time he gets You-Tubed sticking up for a guy being beaten up by thugs, and suddenly Kick-Ass is an online superstar.

In his adventures, he meets two other ""superheroes,"" Big Daddy and Hit Girl who have their own agenda - to take down the big-boss kingpin drug dealer who framed Big Daddy and killed his wife. Hit Girl is eleven and is Big Daddy's own mini-me killing machine (she asks for switch blades on her birthday...awesome!) Meanwhile the drug boss thinks that Kick-Ass is responsible for killing his men even though it's really Big Daddy, so the drug boss' son decides to dress up as a superhero (Red Mist) to lure in Kick-Ass and the other two. In the end Big Daddy and Kick-Ass are captured but are rescued by Hit Girl. Big Daddy dies a fiery death. Together, Hit Girl and Kick-Ass finish what Big Daddy started, taking down the drug boss in an adrenaline-filled, bullet-blasting, bloody extravaganza.

The messages I got from Kick-Ass are as follows:-

1) Don't turn a blind eye to bullies

2) Stick up for people

3) Buy a wetsuit and some nunchucks

4) Learn kung-fu and keep your lunch money

5) Don't let your kids watch this movie or get switch blades for their birthday

I would rate Kick-Ass three and half stars out of five. In Tarantino-esque fashion, it's ingenious, irreverent, violent and vulgar, but like me, you'll watch it and probably enjoy it.",1285459200,2,3044,4.676029962546816
4032338,5,B002ZG9846,"""Kick-Ass"" engaged me from first frame to last.  Reading some of the more negative reviews the resevations about this film seem to center on the use of a preteen (Chloe Grace Moretz) in violent and profane situations.  This debate has been going on since ""The Exorcist"" and ""Taxi Driver"" in the Seventies and this argument will go on forever.  Regardless, I love this movie because it gives a jump start to a moribund genre, the comic book movie.  Director Matthew Vaughan has concocted something fresh, funny, original, and action packed.  Aaron Johnson is fine as Dave/Kick-Ass but everyone knows this is Moretz's vehicle.  Whenever she's on screen the energy level of the film rises appreciably.  Moretz's work here suggests a young Jodie Foster in the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"".  Christopher Mintz-Plasse's star continues to rise after his memorable turn as McLovin in ""Superbad"".  If memory serves the film did OK but not great box office.  A sequel is alluded to at the end of the film so I hope ""KIck-Ass"" developes enough of a cult following so that comes to fruition.",1285459200,,1079,4.944444444444445

Back in 1987 I went to the theater to see the movie ROBOCOP. I left the theater so pleasantly surprised, I couldn't fathom why this classic film could be marketed so wrongly. Even the name ROBOCOP suggests something uber-cheesy. I was totally exhilarated by ROBOCOP and the complex, funny, and character driven script that led to the great film I had viewed. I feel exactly the same about KICK-ASS. I had zero desire to see this film in it's theatrical release. All based on advertising. I had expected something as cheesy and kid friendly as SPIDERMAN 1, 2, or 3. What was delivered to me was one of the most chaotic, unapologeticly adult oriented flicks I've ever been privy to view. Not unlike ROBOCOP, KICK-ASS is an intelligent, character driven motion picture geared for the sensibilities, and sense of humor, of the mature viewer that needs a movie like this to remind them that some movies are made to ENTERTAIN. And that's what this flick does. It's damn entertaining. It's much better going into this knowing little about the storyline, so I'm not divulging.

That being said, I have to say I was very surprised by this movie.  I thought it would be stupid fluff with a few funny parts... However it really had a great story line!  It was hilarious and action packed with some great actors to boot.  (Gotta love Nicolas Cage, all his movies are entertaining!)  Since I purchased this it has been watched repeatedly by every memeber of my family and we all love it(includeding the 2 year old, who shouldn't, lol).

As far as super hero movies go... I found this one to be more believable than most.  The idea being that normal people decide to take a stand and become super heros to help out others.

4032560,4,B002ZG9846,"The great thing about movies that enter the realm of super heroes is that nothing is over the top. Anything goes, and that is precisely why I read them on a weekly basis while growing up. The sixties were a different era of course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while you studied and imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with `Kick-Ass', I did exactly as I did so many years ago. Open it up, sit back and hopefully, watch in awe.

The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very important due to many not having read the `Kick-Ass' series. I had never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough. So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they did.

The rise of `Kick-Ass' was due to frustration with the status-quo. You don't have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the second ingredient to becoming `Kick-Ass' (courage) that is uncommon. So young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an alter-ego `Kick-Ass' and sets out to make a difference in his world. Along the way, he'll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition can be a two-edged sword.

Each page of `Kick-Ass' yields additions to the film that are a surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he'll be reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I'm not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch the movie and let the story evolve.

The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After all, there's a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school.",1284681600,2,2504,4.520971302428256

Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!!

The Act I set-up is full of the clichs and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).

Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).

Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass!

Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl--what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.

The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass--suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!

The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.

Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick.",1284422400,23,4828,4.794471153846154

The young cast, led by Aaron Johnson, really shines. Characters are about as well developed as a vehicle like this will permit. Nicolas Cage is fine in his supporting role - he contributes just the right amount of father-figure.

Yet another film I never got around to watching in theaters, but still a piece of work that I ended up liking a lot, Kick-Ass really caught me by surprise with the mishmash of elements it possessed in both writing and production. Initially, the trailer for this movie had me thinking it would be more along the lines of a satire, which it kind of is, but it's also a representation of the superhero genre as well as a parody in and of itself (think Edgar Wright and his work with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz). While not any one aspect of the film overpowers the other, I think there are enough of them to cater to a multitude of audiences. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an average teenager with average problems who likes to read comics, becomes a self-made, wannabe superhero, and within this life, comes to realize its hazards, while also trying to impress a girl at school (Lyndsy Fonseca). He meets two true superheroes in Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and adventure ensues as they try to bring down big-time mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). For me personally, I found the main theme to be a coming-of-age story. Dave has a good heart and wants to do good things (and get laid), but ultimately isn't much of a superhero, later realizing he wasn't really cut out for the gig. His character is sympathetic and very relatable, in my opinion, and does a great job propelling the audience into all kinds of other aspects. In addition to Dave's self-discovery, the film also has various instances of dark and raunchy comedy, character drama, vengeance and redemption, and brutal, stylized violence, of which the last is probably the most controversial in the form of 11 year-old Moretz's depiction for her character. However, if anything else, this particular aspect of the film will probably wow most people over because it really is a great performance with enough of a message (if you want to interpret one), while also being escapist entertainment at its best. I just wish the movie were a little longer to flesh out the characters a bit more, but we'll see if they expand upon that in the sequel.

Video - 4.0

I swear I thought something was wrong with the transfer upon my initial viewing. Colors seem vibrant enough, but become way overblown at times, while black levels were inconsistent, crushed, and on occasion shades of blue. Contrast was affected as well by those fluctuating blacks and resulted in lost detail and smeared textures. But after watching the extras, I found out it was all intentional. You see, in the comics the ink artist was told that he wasn't to use the color black.. ever. Looking at some of the pictures from the comic, it certainly makes for a much more peculiar type of art style, but what looks good on paper doesn't always necessarily translate well to the film medium. While the grain thing may have worked for Zack Snyder and 300, colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness still had an amazing amount of depth, detail, and delineation through his cinematography. But here, a lot of the uniqueness seems to work more against the picture than for it. The best examples I can use for comparison are the scenes where Big Daddy raids the lumber factory and the one where Hit Girl is trying to save him and Kick-Ass. In the raid scene, you get a really good look at his costume from a variety of angles. You think it'd be a black, Batman-type suit with a black shotgun in his hands, right? Well, neither of them are black, they're ""Off-Black."" Who's ever heard of the color ""Off-Black?"" Black is supposed to be black. But then in the rescue scene when the lights are shot out, the pitch black darkness is as black as the abyss of death (or whatever scary, black allusion you can think of). There were actual blacks within the cinematography here, and they were absolutely perfect. It's just a shame the rest of the film wasn't as clean. Kudos to DP, Ben Davis, and the color department for trying preserve the intended look and integrity of the comic, though.

Audio - 5.0

Sure the video is a bit questionable, but the audio has no issues, whatsoever. The DTS-HD 7.1 track is relatively underused in the presence of dialogue, which sounds perfect and un-muddled, by the way. But when action and ambiance occur, it's quite the technical nugget. Directionality consists of a mixed bag and presents itself mainly through the use of music and whatever sound effects are present on-screen. Things like cars, city noise, and crowd chatter do what's expected of them in terms of proper placement and panning, while the more aggressive sounds like hits, cuts, thuds, and gunshots have a tendency to disperse through any one of the other six surround channels when the moment calls for them. Musical accompaniment and songs from a wide variety of artists and the four composers who worked on this film do a splendid job adding pace and mood, particularly the John Williams Superman homage in Kick-Ass' theme and the Zimmer/Howard Joker theme used build tension at one point. Separation of said effects and music are spot-on, never letting the dialogue get lost. A few great reference scenes would be the aforementioned Big Daddy raid and Hit Girl rescue, or even the final scene where Hit Girl invades D'Amico's headquarters, as there's quite a bit of action and gunshot activity throughout each. LFEs aren't too frequent, but really make themselves known in the form of heavier rounds being fired and through the occasional explosion, burning flame, or bass rhythm. Don't be fooled by the majority of a front-heavy presentation at the beginning. Things will unfold as they should.

Extras - 5.0

Kick-Ass is loaded with special features. I literally spent 6 hours watching every single feature on the disc: the movie, the movie with P-i-P commentary (skipped the audio one since it's excerpted from the Bonus View Mode), and then the 2-hour making-of featurette (actually a little over 2 hours, if you combine it with the ""history of the comic"" feature). So this Bonus View thing is apparently Lionsgate's answer to Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode. A window for the commentary takes up the screen with director Matthew Vaughn sitting there in a studio watching the movie (which plays on your screen in the bottom corner), while bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage is mixed in with his comments. It's damn informative in a lot of aspects from the pre-production, filming, and post-production phases down to the challenges faced in making the whole thing. Vaughn presents himself well and seems to be really proud of what he accomplished, given a lot of problems that occurred and the fact that they only had a $28 million dollar budget. It's a mix between business-oriented and kick-back commentary on the project and manages to be a very engaging experience. On the other hand, the making-of feature doesn't recycle a thing from the Bonus View Mode and is all fresh material. It essentially covers more of the overall production of the film from beginning to end in great detail and has various interviews, excerpts, and events to really show the viewer how much freakin' work they put into it. Then finally, there's a 20-minute feature talking about the comic, what Mark Millar wanted to do with it, how John Romita Jr. went about drawing it, and all that other stuff. It's truly an exhausting set of extras, but if you ever wanted to know anything about Kick-Ass in either movie or comic form, the Blu-ray is where you need to look.

Overall - 4.5

This movie was a big surprise for me. Most comic book adaptations to the big screen tend to have fairly linear narratives, an understood formula for storytelling, and plausible protagonists. Kick-Ass is kind of a warped version of these elements, though oddly enough still manages to tell the same kind of story. Its style and overall structure may divide audiences a bit and feel more like a cult favorite compared to the more mainstream franchises, but I personally enjoyed the movie for its quirkiness (a little bit of Vaughn's residual days working on Lock, Stock and Snatch, perhaps?). With a somewhat underwhelming video transfer, perfect audio, and a boatload of extras, Kick-Ass comes highly recommended, especially for fans.",1283817600,6,8292,4.809256661991585

WOW! Hit girl really made the movie with her amazing fighting and assassination skills so this movie really reminded me alot of Kill bill. So if you liked Kill Bill, you definitely going to like Kick-Ass mostly because of the Hit Girl character.

4032903,2,B002ZG9846,"The problem that I have with Kick-Ass isn't that it is relentlessy violent (albeit in an over the top, almost cartoonish manner), overflowing with profanity or even that one of the main characters is an 11 year old girl who slices and dices crooks and bad guys with a child like sense of glee.  No, what I found to be most disappointing about this big screen adaptation of the graphic novel (which I've never read) is that it is not as darkly funny, satirical, shocking or cool as it thinks it is.  In fact, I was fairly bored with the majority of the movie.  I guess I just don't get it.

Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a typical teenager who thinks that it might be cool to become a costumed crime fighter.  Dave tells us via voice over narration, that he doesn't have any real reason to carry out this plan other than it is a fantasy that he thinks would be fun to play out.  He is not driven by any of the reasons that so frequently occur in comic books.  He doesn't have the need to avenge the death of his parents, he wasn't exposed to any radioactive materials and he is not an angry outcast.  As he tells us, he is pretty much a normal teenager.

That is certainly an interesting hook to build the movie around, and I had hope early on that this would make for an engrossing and unique film.  But as it turns out, that is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, Kick-Ass is certainly trying to provoke thought and discussion about subjects such as our youtube obsessed culture and how it can turn anyone into an overnight sensation, and the dangers of living in a fantasy world. But it just never sucks you into the comic book world it so meticulously creates.

The perils of severing ties with reality is illustrated in the movie by the presence of a father-daughter crime fighting duo known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage in a corny Bat-Man suit) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz).  These two team up with Dave's newly created superhero, Kick-Ass, after they save him from being slaughtered by some very real, very dangerous bad guys.  Cage's Big Daddy is a former cop who has turned his life into a comic book/video game where the goal is to take down the drug kingpin who framed him and sent him to prison which ultimately resulted in his wife's suicide.  It seems that in order to cope with his grief and loss, Cage's character has created a fantasy world where he fights crime.  One of the consequences of his break with reality is that he has pulled his daughter into the abyss with him, turning her into a vicious killing machine.  Big Daddy has even written a comic book that chronicles the events that set him on his current path.  Clearly he can't face the reality of what has happened to him.

The movie even casts a critical eye on its audience as well since it almost dares us to cheer Hit Girl on as she amasses an unfathomable body count.  Have we become so desensitized to violence by comic books and video games (there is one fight scene in which Hit Girl takes out a team of gangsters while wearing night vision goggles that was very reminiscent of many first person shooter video games that I've played) that we have no problem accepting the scenario of a child committing heinous murders, or is it all just intended to be darkly humorous in the vein of a Quentin Tarantino movie?

The answer that I arrived at was that I didn't really care because the movie was not worth putting that much thought into.  It is largely devoid of humor, true satirical bite and most importantly, entertainment value.  In the end, it was not unlike many ultraviolent video games that I've played:  noisy and forgettable.",1283644800,,3628,4.462121212121212

...And that line was spoken by the eleven year old superheroine of this film. KICK-ASS is a cornball classic that is definitely headed for a kind of immortality as a camp set-up of BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN. It's the story of ordinary Dave Lizewsky of Queens NY, who one day decides to take up the job of local superhero for lack of any other ambitions.

Dave has problems being a superhero. Unlike Peter Parker/Spider-Man he has no unnatural super powers (except ""being invisible to girls""); he lacks the technological skills of Tony Stark/Ironman; and he has no millions to spend on creating a persona like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Instead, he buys a lime green wetsuit and mask from a sporting goods store, arms himself with a couple of wooden batons which he can barely hold, and names himself ""Kick-Ass."" He's strictly a bargain-bin superhero.

His first ""assignment"" is to rescue a cat (""Mr. Bitey"") from a tree; he falls out and concusses himself. In his second assignment he tries to stop two punks from breaking into a car. They throw him a beating and stab him in the gut. While he's crawling away from the fight he gets struck by a hit and run driver.

The run-down is serendipitous. Rendered largely neuropathic from the accident, he feels little pain, and most of his bones are replaced with titanium plates and rods. When he recovers, he goes back to getting a beating for crime, this time trying to break up a street fight. It's a draw, but someone posts the video online, and overnight, Kick-Ass becomes a folk hero for tryng to save the victim.

What nobody knows is that two real superheroes, ""Big Daddy"" (in a Batman-like costume) and his sass-mouthed, weapons-qualified preteen daughter ""Hit Girl"" (think a four-foot Robin with purple hair) are terrorizing a gang of mobsters.

In the meantime, Kick-Ass is reveling in his fame and enjoying his sweet new girlfriend. What he doesn't know is that the mobsters think he is the superhero who has been tormenting them. They try to lure him out by baiting him with a possible sidekick ""Red Mist"" (the superheroic names in this movie are intentionally lame), and this leads to the grand battle between Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl on one side and Red Mist and the mobsters on the other.

By far the best character is not Kick-Ass himself, but Hit Girl. One 17 year old character announces his plan to save himself for her; a reviewer says he wants to adopt her. Noble sentiments all.",1283040000,,2458,4.728971962616822

4032988,1,B002ZG9846,"Rating Worthless

It seems lately that every year there are a handful of films that just the right amount of people tout as being a truly great and original piece of cinema. Let the Right One In, the Wrestler & Adventureland immediately come to mind but at least those films warrant, save for Adventureland which only gets *, a worth seeing (**) rating whereas the newest addition to this list, 2010's Kick-Ass, doesn't even measure up the good deal of mediocrity found in those several films.

Based on a comic I've never read, or had ever even heard of, and have no interest in pursuing, I decided to check this out solely to say that I'd seen it. I went in with no expectations, which was a wise choice, because I feel as if I had gone into this with some kind of expectations, oh I don't know a few laughs and some interesting ideas, the failure to meet them would have ended up wholely immeasurable.

Aaron Johnson plays the title character, who makes a point to let us know that people like Spider-Man and Superman could never actually exist in real life (a statement as eye opening as the entry level philosophical ideas at play in David Fincher's equally useless film Fight Club.) and that he's just a regular teenager who possesses no luck with the ladies and spends the vast majority of his time watching TV, reading comics and jerking off (oh, strained reltability, how awkward and annoying you are.) The film wants to be something more than just another movie based on a comic, it wants to be the anti-super hero super hero film by injecting lots of realistic cynicism and black humor, but all of these attempts fall as flat on their face as the character in the opening shot who under the impression that his homemade wings will allow him to fly from the top of a skyscraper dies after crashing onto the roof of a car parked below.

Eventually Kick-Ass, AKA Dave, finds out that he's not the only person in his city willing to wear an outfit and fight crime, there's a father and daughter team who are dedicated to eradicating everyone involved in the local mega-crime boss' syndicate. Roger Ebert lost his marbles over the film BECAUSEthe daughter in the team is a pre-teen, or 13 or something, and she delights in heavy weaponry, flowing profanity and expert headshots. Morally irresponsible he cried; painfully boring and trying way too hard cries I. There could be read the implications by the creator of the comic and the director of the film that the father in the team is beyond psychologically warped because he's brainwashed his daughter to become the NRA's wildest dream, a mini-Dirty Harry who dispenses of human life without a moment's thought or hesitation because they're the ""bad guys"", but that isnt' it, this is just a stupid little film without a single redeemable quality.

Vastly inferior to Jody Hill's 2009 misunderstood near-masterpiece Observe and Report; a black comedy with numerous interesting qualities.",1282953600,8,2944,4.7421875
4033079,5,B002ZG9846,"It is great to watch a film that it is entertaining in an innovative way. I bought this movie not really knowing what the plot was about. I heard many people praising it that is why I wanted to check it out. It seems that this film is part of a post-modern movement in filmmaking.

As a mom, I am still shocked at how much I loved this film, although the violence was a bit much for me at times (though necessary for the plot).  The acting is above and beyond, with Nicolage Cage bringing his A game.  The little girl, Chloe Moretz, who plays ""Hit Girl"" is off the charts, ridiculously adorable and a bad ass, a strange combination for a child that works incredibly well here.  She's a sceen stealer and I don't want to give any plot points away, but I was often terrified she was going to hurt herself.  The lead, ""Kick-Ass,"" Aaron Johnson is believable and no matter how far fetched the movie dives, you're wanting him to win.

Although the film follows a Hollywood agenda it does it in an innovative cool way. The visuals of the film keep you watching it. Boundaries are pushed throughout the film.  The directing and editing is flawless (for me!) and it's one that I will definately watch again as I'm sure there is much I missed the first time around.

If you want to watch a fun film Kick Ass is perfect for you. The Blu-Ray version is great because it also comes with a DVD and a digital copy. This is NOT for kids.  I loved that such a wild and crazy film could have so much heart.  We've all felt like ""Kick-Ass"" at one point or another.",1282867200,2,1546,4.263698630136986

Therefore, he orders himself a standard superhero suit becoming Kick-Ass and is carried away in his fantasy.  He barely escapes the first hero attempt and to satisfy the girl of his dreams, asks for more.  He is in over his head and as luck would have, he is spared his fate by the intervention of a real superhero, Hit-Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz) and her Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage.)

I have to admit that I never read the comic. I am sure that there is the standard mix of people that like or dislike the differences. However, this film can stand on its own as fun entertainment.  I especially like the nonchalant attitude of the Mindy Macready character as she casually dispatches bad guys and evil doers.

This is well suited for the Blu-ray experience.

Be sure to look at the DVD extras. In one of the documentaries, they note that hit girl is dressed in a standard student uniform. Until I saw this documentary, I never thought of the fact that it was not meant to be sexy but imply that she was a poor lost child.

The acting was also great and it had an interesting storyline. Now all of those people out there who are saying that this was such a horrible movie and that it's not a family movie and such. Well, I just have to say a couple things. First, it is rated R. Right there should be enough for most parents to not let their children watch this movie. Second, if you let your kids watch some R rated movies based on their content, you can look right on the back of the dvd case or on the internet and it tells you right there why it's rated R. And I believe it says on the back of this case that this movie is rated R because it has brutal violence throughout, pervasive language, sexual content, nudity, and drug use - some involving children. As I have said, that is as it says exactly on the back of this movie's case. Right there should send up a red flag that this movie is not for kids. If you let your kids watch movies without even knowing why they are rated what they are, then you are just asking for your children to see things that they are not ready to see or hear stuff you don't want them to. So don't blame the movie, blame yourself.

Over all, this was a very good movie - for adults. And if you give this movie a bad rating because its not a family friendly movie, just look on the back of the case and you will see that it was never intended for family audiences in the first place.",1282521600,,1553,4.02588996763754

The nerdy kid, buys a costume on amazon :) then gets stabbed in the gut and hit by a car by a jerk who doesn't even stop to see if he's alive. I was tempted to stop watching right there, but the characters were too good. I was worried there would be a bunch of teenagers out there who would don a wet suit and fight crime,  I don't think so.  The rest of the movie where Mindy starts actually doing all the ass kicking is brilliantly enthralling and heart aching to watch. I even loved Red Mist,  who they kept alive at the end of the movie for kickass number2...
Who wouldn't want a one girl/boy hit team to knock off the mafia once and for all? Big Daddy realizes that the ""good guys"" aren't going to do it as they are themselves entangled with the mob. The story has been told before if you listen to the news. I know we will never have a real life Mindy to slay the scumbags for us, but we can enjoy it while it lasts.
As for seeing a little girl do all this killing, it seemed exactly like a game to her which made it ok.  Nicolas Cage's character had already made all the sacrifices and was not about to have his little girl be helpless, which is what caused the mother's death. Empowering ouselves to be able, like Kick Ass to stand up to bullies and not be victims. Speak softly and carry a big bazooka.

4033259,5,B002ZG9846,"I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of Kick Ass back in April of 2010 I decided to give the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/graphic-novel/dp/0785134352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">graphic novel</a>&nbsp;a try. First of all, it was a fun, very quick read, because it was heavy on the ""graphic"" and light on the ""novel"". Lot's of well-drawn, ""graphic"", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere (as well as other bodily fluids).

Now it's very rare that I say what I am about to say and many of the book's fans, Mark Millar fans and just plain old folks that disagree will call me blasphemous, but....The movie adaptation of Kick Ass is better than the comic book; um, I mean book; er, I mean graphic novel. Oh sure, the movie takes some liberties over what was originally drawn out in print. In my opinion a good movie adaptation of a book needs only to be as good as or better than the original author's ideas, and Director Matthew Vaughn pulled this off flawlessly.

Don't get me wrong; the original story is mostly intact. Vaughn just takes the over the top, crazy-violent, captivating story of a teenager that dares to live out his dream of being a superhero to a new level in the film version. The story is very well written and flows superbly. Meet Dave Lizewski whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying ""you guessed it"" now.) He puts on a costume, calls himself Kick Ass, and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.

He also finds out that he's not alone in his fantasy world of kids gone superhero. Enter Hit Girl played by Chloe Moretz. Moretz's performance is a big part of what took Kick Ass from a 4-Star movie to a 5-Star movie for me. Moretz is no wimpy kid, and the girl she is in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-a-Wimpy-Kid/dp/B002ZG97G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a>&nbsp;is nowhere to be found in Kick Ass. She slices, dices and she does it with a smile. Okay, yes, it sounds morbidly disturbed to praise an 11 year old for chopping up bad guys with such a seemingly pleasurable disposition. But, man, that one scene where she chops, then looks over at Kick Ass with that little girl, new front teeth smile as if to say, ""check me out, wasn't that cool,"" only to repeat the same action a few more times unflappably just won me over.

And the rest of the cast turn in A-List performances as well. Not just Aaron Johnson who plays Lizewski/Kick Ass, but the whole doggone cast...including Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy. Cage ain't no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Rider/dp/B000OVLBIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Rider</a>&nbsp;in this movie; he's a quirky, washed up cop that's out for revenge against a mobster who framed him in a former life, and Cage plays the role perfectly. While the character of Big Daddy is a bit different from the tough guy character in the book, it takes nothing from the story and I think that only a preservationist could disagree.

Like I said earlier, the story is deliberately over the top and even pretty believable up until some of our heroes start to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. But the great acting, directing and flawless execution of every scene made up for any of the silliness that wasn't designed to be silly.

This one goes on my shelf right next to some of my other favorite cult classic movies. If you're already a fan too and you haven't heard, there's a Kick Ass 2 planned for 2012, but I'd predict that topping the original will be about as successful as topping...well...you try to name a cult classic sequel that has ever outdone itself.

4033261,2,B002ZG9846,"It seems the supporters of this movie are legion here at Amazon, but I don't have any problems taking the less popular opinion.  My husband and I were at the supermarket when a family full of kids in front of us rented this film out.  I would be terrified if my 9 and 11 yr old ever got to see this film.

The combination of irrational music with inappropriate images probably began with Kubrick's Clockwork Orange.  Tarantino supercharged it and made it ""cool"" for girls to go around hacking people up and chopping limbs off - something that were it done by men, would be criticized as gratuitous violence.  ""Kick Ass"" is just an inevitable progression, from women being violent, to young girls being violent.  If this is all just entertainment with no real-life consequences, then how is it you now see young school girls today kicking and punching each other on youtube without a moment's hesitation?  When boys do it, it's already reprehensible, but I suppose it's socially acceptable given their history of violence and cultural conditioning.  However, girl's have traditionally provided an alternative...a place to go, a peaceful choice, when you want to opt out of violence.  If every girl started imitating what boys do, then there is no longer an option: violence is THE only answer.

I suppose this is- or eventually will be - what it will mean to be a ""modern"" girl. Did anyone even notice Rasuls's girlfriend getting violently impaled against a door with two knives by the 11 year old girl?  What did the girlfriend do that deserved that kind of ""justice?""  And I still don't understand why so many men find it sexy and cool for girls to do exactly what other men do.  Imagine if a male superhero (say Superman, or Batman came into the enermy's lair and stabbed the enemy's girlfriend to death.  People would react a different way)

If you just want entertainment, then as an adult, this movie may entertain you.  But the subversiveness of packaging it as a kid's flick shows that Hollywood will stop at nothing to make a quick buck.  Sure, it's R-rated, but that never stopped anyone...especially when you consider the hip teenybop soundtrack, and how the final showdown / shootout was ""framed"" like a 3-D X-Box game...all in the language that young kids are attuned to.

Violence has always been acceptable where sex isn't, and now it's down to young girls  (compare this with Brooke Shields in 'Pretty Baby' and the public outcry against that movie)  Remarkably, Kick Ass actually has an internal dialogue that questions its own motives.  Look at the conversation between fellow police partner Marcus and Big Daddy (Cage):

Marcus: ""Is this how you brainwash Mindy?""
Big Daddy:  ""You say brainwash, I say 'made it into a game.'""
Marcus: ""Vigilante justice, mass murder?  C'mon partner!""

The scene with all the kids living in ""YouTube time"", chosing to film an assault to 'share' online, instead of doing something, like calling out for help is also poignant.

I know many people say, ""relax! chill out!  this is nothing but entertainment, it's a comedy, this is only fantasy, it allows our imagination to romp etc etc etc...""

Ok. To that, I present Kick Ass / Dave Lizewski's internal speech before he launches into his first actual battle with the two thugs:

""Like every serial killer already knew, eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you anymore...it's time to engage.""",1281916800,13,3399,4.852430555555555

The director truly is amazing - he took what could have easily been a dumb, cheesy movie and made something hilarious, action-packed and emotional.

Word of warning - this is not a kids movie.  It's violent and disturbing - think ruthless mobsters, a knife-wielding 11-year old girl and a bazooka among other treats.  It's unpredictable, the story surprised me constantly and to top it off the soundtrack is awesome.

In interviews he based his acting method in the movie with Adam West who played Batman (there are similarities in look between the two) from the 70s tv show.

Now don't expect this to be a teen action movie about a nerdy high schooler who becomes a super hero. Its rated R for a very good reason.

Special features:
-Commentary with the director
-A documentary on the making of the comic
-Storyboard art (no video just looking at them)
-Movie trailers

4033266,5,B002ZG9846,"The beginning of the movie is Quentin Tarantino does Napoleon Dynamite, without the annoying flashbacks, just annoying first person narration. The first person narration eventually goes away. A geek kid decides to become a superhero, and as in real life he doesn't get superhero results. When he is faced with certain death he is saved by an 11 year old girl in a mask(Hit Girl). This is a remarkable scene as the sound track plays the music from the Banana Splits. Yes, the sound track helped make the movie.

The initial scene with Nicolas Cage was also a great scene. In order to be a big hit, a movie needs a few great scenes and no bad scenes. I believe this film will be a cult classic. I thought the teen acting was all excellent except for the Red Mist. His bad acting was made up for by a sensational performance by Hit Girl (Dakota Fanning move over) who owned every scene she was in.

The nudity mentioned on the box must refer to the quick glimpse we get of ""National Geographic porno"" we see on the computer while our hero has his pants at his ankles. Frequent f-bomb.",1281744000,,1081,4.42713567839196

It balanced the humor and drama like few movies can without destroyng the experience. It has a high re-watch value and could become a cult classic. There was no nudity and while the violence was almost excessive they did it without exploiting it. What I mean by that is they did not dwell on the violence. It was done in quick shots. Not gratutious at all. Loved this movie and look forward to seeing it again.,1281744000,,559,4.333333333333333

4033339,5,B002ZG9846,"The first backlash against the film was, understandably, towards the young female character who talks dirty and likes to shoot people in the head. So, began the long stream of ""morally reprehensible"" laden reviews for a generation cultured on media violence to absorb...or not.

Kick Ass thoroughly represents America's infatuation with violence, guns, and well...immorality. It's like witnessing a mass shooting firsthand. It's cold, ruthless and unforgiving. There are no redeemable qualities in really any of the characters. We see revenge, greed, and lust but we are not immersed in any heroism.

This creates a visceral experience that I am not able to say that I disliked. Indeed, what makes this film so good is it's break from traditional character molds. It does not represent justified killing or a morality tale. It flies in the face of what critics like Roger Ebert look for in a film. That is a literary change portrayed on screen.

However, does a lack of such criteria make this less than a film? Does it make it less of a social statement on the culture of violence? Sometimes, a film can succeed in greatness without teaching you something about morality. Sometimes, a film succeeds on it's cold realism alone. Does that make an eleven year old assassin any more realistic? No...but it livens the fact that not everything is traditional peaches n' cream.",1281657600,,1371,5.004385964912281
4033340,1,B002ZG9846,"Disgusting. ""Kick Ass"" is enough to give you impressional indigestion for a long time. It is difficult to see who this movie is oriented to. It is too puerile, too comic book, for any thinking adult and much too violent for teens or kids. The assumption is a few dork teen kids become  ""superheroes"" by putting on masks and tights, (without any superpowers). And fight thug bad guys.

Kids and friends get graphically beat up, gouged knifed, shot. There is a sweet little girl maybe 11, played by Chloe Moretz, who gets into a fist fight with villain Mark Strong who is more than a foot taller and outweighs her by 100 lbs. Gratuitous wincing violence. There are a lot of movies like Batman and Superman where there is comic book violence. This is not one of those.  Don't pollute your mind with this pointless ultraviolent trash. If you have kids, or young kids, I recommend you resist allowing your children to.

It is a sad day for this country, for the world, when this junk is considered ""entertainment"". Repulsive.",1281657600,25,1020,4.65

4033344,5,B002ZG9846,"I am usually hypercritical of the formula romantic comedies, action films, etc. that come out of the US movie industry, specifically Hollywood and NY, but this one, despite a slow start and awkward ending was a total surprise. Just thinking about the movie the day after provokes a chuckle so there's a little something special embedded in this movie - kudos to the KA film posse.

Let's cut it short - five big ones for this little creative and surprising gem.

Caveats to the viewers and to Chloe Grace (Mindy). First to the viewing audience as you already know from other sources there's a bit of profanity and blood - don't worry it's so outrageous it's more funny than psychologically harmful. Second to Chloe Grace,  take everything you said and did as outrageous satire and be sure to hold up as some of your role models truly great athletes who are always in control of themselves. Despite the battles they encounter they don't need the profanities, the fights - they handle it all with artistic intelligence and skill.",1281484800,8,1027,4.758426966292135
4033345,5,B002ZG9846,"I have wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer over a year ago. What looked to be just another ""by the numbers"" sophomoric comedy turns out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.

This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for kids, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.

As far as the violence involving this young actress, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.

There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.

Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as ""Big Daddy"" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. ""Hit Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.

While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.

The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.

In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!",1281484800,14,3690,4.4017595307917885

Although he has no superhero, he has metal plates in some parts of his skeleton and excellent fighting abilities with two clubs in his arms fighting whatever criminal and thug is out there. However, two of the city's well known superheroes such as Big-Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and assassin Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) begin to make a comeback since Kick-Ass has became a pop culture phenomenon as they start to kill some crooks by themselves as well as have Kick-Ass join them. The don's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes an anti-hero himself called Red Mist to lure the heroes into a deadly trap that can cost them their lives.

Ultraviolent, hilarious and wild action-comedy based on the cult Marvel comic from Mark Millar! this one is basically like a satire on superheroes even on the very idea that what if superheroes existed in real life. The film has been controversial due to an 11 year old girl character killing people and cussing even though the actress is really in her young teens, i think this movie is a gory and relentless action packed bath of jokes and blood with ideas of course, this movie is a winner all the way.

This is not one of those movies!

Ranting aside, this was a pretty awesome movie.  If you like action movies, check it out.  It's a little darker, a little more violent, and a lot more vulgar than you might expect, but that's part of the movie's brilliance.

4033389,4,B002ZG9846,"Kick Ass concerns young Dave Lizewski (played wonderfully by Aaron Johnson) who wonders - why aren't there any super heroes?  Despite his friends' advice that anyone who tried would be killed in a day he tries and is promptly almost killed.  Several steel plates and a higher tolerance for pain (due to damaged nerves) later and he's at it again.

This is a wonderful movie full of wit and charm but also full of violence and is not for the squeamish.  Buying himself a super hero-ish suit from eBay Dave eventually make a splash fighting off some thugs and getting posted on YouTube.  Before long he's unintentionally running afoul of organized crime and other superheroes alike.  Additionally he's having trouble wooing the girl he likes since she mistakenly thinks he's gay due to a rumor that started after his accident.

Those other superheroes come in the form of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Big Daddy is a wronged man with a grudge and Hit Girl is his 11 or 12 year old daughter he's trained in weapons, martial arts and the art of killing.  This most likely is why a big studio would not pick this project up (their loss) and what may put some people off.  But let me tell you ALL the best action scene in this move involve Hit Girl kicking butt and taking names.  She easily and literally slices through gang members and gangsters with glee.  There's something about her though, a sweetness and an eagerness to please her dad that makes you like her.

The local crime boss takes exception to all the super hero-ing going on and his son (Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse) hatches a plan to lure in Kick Ass.  Bad things ensue all leading up to one of the more satisfying finales I've seen in a super hero flick in a while.  And in the end we get a bittersweet yet triumphant ending.

Here are some downsides I saw.  It seemed like the injuries received by Kick Ass early on were almost magically healed.  He took pretty horrific injuries and based on the x-ray we are shown of his metal plates he should at least have some wicked scars but that's not the case.  Subsequent beatings yield similar results.  I know it's an action film so some of that should be expected but there it is.  Also the gay subplot seemed to be too easily and quickly wrapped up - one short scene and, bam, it was resolved.  CGI blood is way too obvious.

But there is so much good.  This movie has heart and is not just a dumb action movie.  In spots it can make you laugh or cry, it can make you cringe or cheer, it can surprise you and scare you and it can make you think and be wowed.  The various elements of the movie gel together to make a very satisfying whole.  You do care about the characters and all the actors involved do a great job as well.  It's a well rounded movie.  Again though, a warning, this is not for kids.  If you are squeamish and don't like violence or language this is not for you.  It's not as uber violent as it sounds but there are scenes that can make you cringe.  If they'd not gone with the CGI blood in a lot of cases it may have genuinely been gory at times.

I never read the comics or knew anything about it, so when I first watched the movie I was a bit surprised by the violence and blood in it.  However, this movie is great from start to finish.  Tons of actions mixed in with some laugh out loud moments makes this one of the best movies of 2010.

As many other reviewers discussed, Hit Girl is the obvious star of the movie as she steals every scene she is in.  Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) gives one of the best ""child"" performances you will ever see.  All other actors/actresses hold their own in this movie, especially Nic Cage.  I'm not a Nic Cage hater, but I never thought I would say he was absolutely brilliant in any movie.  He plays the role of Big Daddy perfectly and shows emotions that you usually don't see from him in other movies.

Possible spoiler...

One scene that I have to talk about is the ""unmasking"" scene with Kick Ass.  The direction, action and emotion of this scene is unreal.  The Director nailed this moment in the movie with impressive visual camera work and non-stop action.  Really impressive, and is something that you have to see.

4033459,4,B002ZG9846,"Most reviews in the press warned about some kind of ultraviolent, slice-and-dice flick. I was worried. But it's nowhere near as violent as, say, Kill Bill. Not many limbs getting hacked off. Nothing particularly disturbing, although there's implied violence such as a finger getting cut off. It's par for the course for any shoot-em-up these days. No bones breaking and poking through. So what's the real reason for their discomfort?

Well, you do have a 10 or 11-year old girl mouthing obscenities. It is a little disturbing, but it's not plentiful, and it is within character - she's been trained by her ex-policeman Big Daddy. So yes, I wouldn't let kids watch this. She does plant blades and bullets into many baddies, but from the reviews I had expected her to routinely slice them in half. There's nary a beheading.

It's a tale of ordinary folk trying to be superheroes. One doesn't do so well because he has no super powers to speak of - well, none of them do; Hit Girl and her dad do OK because of rigorous training. Kick Ass gets his ass kicked, though not as brutally as I was led to believe. Well, it's still painful.

4033461,4,B002ZG9846,"The concept of an average, every day comic book geek donning spandex attire and becoming a super-hero is one that I find quite interesting. I'm sure there are a few crazy people in the world who have contemplated or even attempted just that, but in the comic world, the only character I've been familiar with becoming a super-hero with no particular superpower is Batman. When this was first released and up to the point of me seeing it, I wasn't familiar that this was also made into a comic book, but I was intrigued by the concept and motive behind why the kid in this film wanted to take the leap of faith in becoming a superhero. I gave it a go, and I must say I loved it. Don't expect a full blown comedy, as it's more of a serious action flick, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.

Starring Aaron Johnson in the title role of Dave Lizewski, the film tells of how Dave has always wondered why nobody has tried being a superhero (except that one guy at the start of the film who ends up dead). Dave decides to stop wondering and buys himself a green and yellow spandex suit and calls himself Kick-Ass. Life as a super-hero doesn't start very well as he's almost killed in his first attempt at heroics, but he's soon back in action and becomes a viral hit as he's filmed saving a lonely stranger from being beaten up. This gets him some unwanted attention from Mob boss, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Passe) as he's mistaken as being the man behind a number of mob deaths which were actually committed by the mysterious Father/Daughter team of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage [sigh]).

The films tone is something that is a lot more serious and brutal than you can possibly guess when first going into it as it starts off quite goofy and funny, but when he puts on his hero suit, the film takes a more serious turn. There are some bad points to the film, but thankfully they are outweighed by a plethora of good points; most importantly the character of Hit-Girl. There are two ways you can look at this character; you can be very disturbed by the fact that an 11 year old girl can call someone a f***er then proceed with blowing an enemies head off, or you can watch that exact scene and think ""that is ""f***ing awesome!"" I chose to go with the latter as she was truly magnificent. Nick Cage, on the other hand, was far from magnificent.

I know Cage has a devoted following of fans, but I think he's just awful. I can't take the man seriously in any role he plays, and in my eyes every moment he was on screen was just the pits (unless he was supported by other cast members). I could have easily given this film a 5 star rating had Cage's character been played by someone a lot more fitting for the role. I would've preferred someone along the lines of Michael Keaton or Kevin Costner, an old school actor that you can still appreciate today and not want to place your palm on your forehead in disappointment the moment they appear on screen.

The look of the film and style of the film overall is brilliantly done. The fact that the film was released shortly before the comic and it was a project that came together collaboratively with Mark Miller working on the comic and Matthew Vaughn working on the movie, when I check the comic out, there will definitely be cool similarities. I would highly recommend this, not for Nick Cage, but for everything else.",1281139200,,3428,4.453821656050955
4033462,4,B002ZG9846,"Dave Lizewski (Johnson) can't help but wonder ""Why has no one tried to become a superhero?"" As a comic-book nut he decides to take his passion to the next level and become a real-life superhero. His journey begins where else, EBay! What do you expect when you are a high school dork with only a $200 budget? His next step, a name...Kick-Ass or as Big Daddy (Cage) says ""more like Ass-Kick""! Of course Kick-Ass has no powers, no skills, no smarts and no cool gadgets but he still inspires NY'ers once his beating by 3 thugs becomes viral on YouTube. His life is now changed by having his own comic book and copy cats. It all seems pretty cool, until he is implicated as the vigilante that is taking down D'Amico's (Strong) drug empire! Now, he is hunted by violent criminals and meets up with a pair of real crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old weapons wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass eventually learns that the duo have their own score to settle with D'Amico. As obsession turns into madness, Kick-Ass is forced to become a real hero or die!

Kudos to everyone involved on this project (both the comic and the film)! Millar's story and Romita's drawings inspired Matt Vaughn's vision and the result is a cult classic that will be loved by comic fanboys and it's own subculture for decades. The true star of this movie is Hit-Girl played amazingly by Chloe Moretz. She absolutely steals the show. Fans of Leon the Professional will immediately pick up the relationship with Moretz and Cage as it is similar to Portman and Reno. The film is dark and although there is comedy, it can be uncomfortable. Ultimately, once the ""Ass-Kickin'"" starts, you will be cheering with every dead bad guy! A must see.

BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful picture with outstanding sound. The colors pop and the blacks are rich. Blu-ray has made the home theatre experience so much better. SPECIAL FEATURES: Fantastic, although I would have loved deleted scenes. The two best features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it. Blu ray collectors should add this as well. Casual fans? Once you see it, you will love it too. A MUST OWN!",1281139200,3,2255,4.6775818639798485

the movie is about a teenager played by aaron johnson(can not remember his name in the film) who decides to become a real life superhero. even though his first attempt almost killed him. his second try at do gooding got him some natioal prasie and made kick ass the name he gave his persona famous without anyone knowing he is really is of course.it also attacts the attation of hit girl(chloe grace moretz) and big daddy(NICOLAS CAGE)vigilaties who actally know what they are doing Unfortanly also the attation of the local crime boss than he finds himself way over his head.

the movie has great performaces all a round espically moretz who i will give props foe being a cute little killing machine.also johnson and cage( as always) also do a good job. and the action is relentleess and unforgiving which is rare in a major release. desevers its r rating(in fact mathew vaughn who dircted the movie had to fund it with help from indepent investors cause the major studios would take it if he removed hit girl and softed the movie to a pg-13 rating).

After his second attempt is a success and he becomes a hit with the public, a dangerous criminal leader Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a hit on Kick-Ass.

Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to ""Kick-Ass"", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.

This stardom catches the attention of ""Hit Girl"", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and ""Big Daddy"", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.

I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

I hestitate to use the term ""super-nonsense."" Part of what makes this film so great is an idea of heroism moored in reality. Mark Millar has brought us so many interesting takes on the super hero mythos; he's a credit to the genre. In Ultimates it was the fallibility of the men/women behind the masks, and the violent implications of supernatural power. In The Authority it was the tacit dominion of these god-like figures we call super heroes.

And in Kick-Ass, it's the consequence of a mortal taking on greater-than-mortal role. The heroes in Kick-Ass bleed (a lot), and cry, and break, just like you and I would. Kick-ass himself, a punching-bag super hero pastiche, represents youths placing themselves in harm's way to find themselves. Correlate his misadventures to what you will: drugs, gangs, self-inflicting, diseases of body image - Kick-ass talks about teenagers and their distorted perception of the world as much as it talks about the distorted world super heroes exist in.

Because of it's social and cultural implications (and the fact that it's so DAMN funny and entertaining) I rank Kick-Ass one of the top 5 super movies ever made.",1280966400,,1387,5.021739130434782
4033618,4,B002ZG9846,"Much better than the last Mark Millar comic to film adaptation, namely Wanted, Kick-Ass is a gleefully ultraviolent blast.

Things don't go so well for him naturally in the process as he winds up getting his you know what handed to him, and eventually comes across masked vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who are targeting gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) whose own son (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides to don a costume and call himself Red Mist.  Directed by Layer Cake helmer Matthew Vaughn (who at one time was set to helm the third X-Men film, and is no preparing an X-Men prequel), Kick-Ass is filled with fun, ridiculous violence and action, but sadly manages to lose steam after its first half.  The cast is great (Cage in particular has great fun doing an Adam West impersonation) all around, but even they can't save the fact that by the time Kick-Ass wraps up, it's become the kind of comic film that it pokes fun at in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that so much of the little things that made the comic and its characters so interesting (namely the real ""secret"" origin of Big Daddy and Hit Girl in the comic) is nowhere to be found, as are most of the darkly comedic moments and are replaced by more or less happier turnouts.  Despite how much the film adaptation of Kick-Ass has been streamlined from the comic though, the film is still plenty fun and enjoyable, and the fact that it didn't undergo a complete overhaul like the film adaptation of Wanted is reason enough to praise it alone.",1280966400,,1740,4.726072607260726

Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), comic book geek and nobody-at-large, always wondered why no one stepped up and became a superhero. People aspire to be doctors and firemen and policemen, so why not also want to be someone else who helped his fellow man?

After ordering a green and yellow wetsuit off the Internet, Dave dons the outfit and hits the streets as Kick-Ass, a superhero without powers, training or even a proper motivation to fight crime other than ""what if?"" The first few weeks are uneventful, and after his first attempt at stopping a car robbery nearly kills him, Dave returns more determined than ever to rid the streets of crime. Soon, after stopping the mugging of a fellow from a gang, Kick-Ass is all over the Internet and soon becomes a citywide celebrity.

Little does he realize he's not alone. Enter Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), a father-daughter team of real-deal vigilantes with a thirst for blood and matching guns to boot. Their mission? Take out the D'Amico crime family, their leader, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), having been personally involved with Big Daddy long ago and robbing him of the one he loved.

Soon Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, Hit Girl and newcomer Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are locked in a war that, hopefully, only the good guys survive.

It's guns, action, comic books and bubble gum in this adaptation of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.'s graphic novel.

This movie is crazy. A good crazy. A special kind of crazy. I knew from the previews I was in for a different kind of superhero flick and, man, that was what I got. This was fresh, exciting, fun and new. Most superhero movies stick to a formula (origin of the good guy then the bad guy, a few tussles along the way leading to a big fight in the end, the stuff in between usually dramatic bits starring the hero in his personal life). With Kick-Ass, though there were those basic elements to it, the one thing that was really hammered home over and over again was the idea that, yeah, Kick-Ass was functioning in the real world. One with guns, knives, average fighting skills and no body armor. Some folks might think the violence in this film was overdone. Personally--despite a few exceptions--I didn't think so. You try doing the superhero thing in real life in a place like New York and see what happens.

I also really liked how they dragged that fantasy of being a superhero into our reality and proved, really, that it wouldn't work. Kick-Ass went up against real bad guys. Ones without mercy. Without care. They'd kill their own mothers if they had to.

The lack of a costumed supervillain also helped this movie and ensured the focus was kept on the good guys. I particularly liked Big Daddy's and Hit Girl's origin. It was simple, yet bittersweet and, if anything, really showed that despite being off his rocker, Big Daddy really loved his little girl and only wanted the best for her.

In terms of the non-costumed scenes, Dave Lizewski's real life was extremely relatable (especially for this comic book nerd) and his high school years and mine seemed to have a lot in common. Except for the girlfriend part. I wasn't cool enough to have one of those.

This movie was fantastic start to finish. The writing, the action, the realism--true cool.
My only thing was the profanity. I don't live in New York, but that was a lot of swearing and if people really talk like that in NYC, man, I feel sorry from them. (But, hey, I'm just a Maple Syrup-guzzling Canadian so what do I know?) If they don't, perhaps the writers can pull back a bit on the wagging tongue for the next one.

Looking forward to the sequel.

Other than that I can honestly say 'Kick-Ass' is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it in theaters, then bought it the day it came out on blu-ray. This movie takes the whole superhero genre to the next level. Rather than having some kid put on a costume and suddenly be amazing, it's the opposite. The kid gets beat up, almost dies. It's interesting because this movie explains the burning question: what aren't there any real-life superheros? This movie is very violent. But unlike other violent movies such as 'Saw' it doesn't go to far. The violence is used only when needed at the right moments, and also helps in certain situations to enhance the comedic effect. Also, there's lots of ""adult language"" used. Even a few words not usually used in movies, but I won't spoil it for you. The other nice part about this movie I like, is that less well known actors are in it. Actors such as Christopher Mintz-Plasse (yes McLovin from Superbad.) It's great and really show the extent of their talents, and also show that you don't need big names to have a good movie. This is an independent film which explains why they can get away with so much. Not much else to say without ruining the movie. All in all a great movie. It's one of the few I'd say buy not rent. Buy the blu-ray version, even if you don't own a blu-ray player. It's nice because it comes with three discs. A blu-ray disc + special features, a dvd version + special features, and a digital copy.

With a few exceptions, they do provide some innovative fighting scenes and hilarious moments.

First, the great. One of the superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), is a adorable 10-year old girl who has a passion for guns and slaughtering bad guys the way other young girls get excited for jewelry or dolls. Chloe is a great actress and gives her character a unique spunk and energy. In several scenes, she has the best fighting scenes and is absolutely merciless. She easily steals the show.

The fighting scenes are also pretty cool. Make no mistake - this is a violent movie. But unlike a lot of other fighting movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;is willing to be original in terms of who gets killed and how. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that somebody knows how to use a knife very well. At times, you won't know whether to be disgusted by the violence or laughing at the absurdity.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;also sets up the contrasts between the mundane and superhero worlds really well. The high school world of teen romance and comic books looks petty in comparison with the blood and gore of the fight scenes. Also, the corny superhero names and goofy costumes contrasted with the deadly seriousness of the characters - what a riot. And, of course Chloe Moretz as a cute little girl who swears like a truck driver and kills like a commando is the ultimate mind-boggling contrast in this movie.

I did feel the movie went a bit far in some scenes. Some scenes were just filled with gratuitously bloodshed and outright murder. I still don't get why Hollywood has abandoned the art of panning away right before the victim gets killed (interestingly enough, the only time&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;does spare you the sight of blood is when a female gets killed). I think the movie would actually have benefitted from a bit less explicit gore and more innuendo.

I also thought the rest of the casting was alright, but not stellar. I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, and this movie convinced me that his acting just isn't up to it. The contrast between him and Chloe Moretz - his daughter in the movie - is striking. Aaron Johnson is decent as the dorky Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, but gets overshadowed halfway through the film - his character reaches his peak too quickly. Mark Strong as the druglord villain just doesn't convince. We're supposed to fear and hate his character, but really he just comes across as a good excuse to kick some ass.

Overall, I'd warn sensitive types away from this movie. This is a comedy only in the darkest sense. However, if you like a few laughs, a bit of fighting, and a lot of both mixed together,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;works wonders.

You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.

Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.

'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old. Still, this movie is incredible it has huge laughs mind blowing fight scenes and it just oozes with awesomeness. And hey, how many times and the success of a movie based on a graphic novel cause the authors of the first to write a sequel and base a sequel film on it?",1280880000,2,1630,4.358552631578948
4033626,4,B002ZG9846,"This film was certainly a pleasant surprise: a smart, funny superhero movie. What a concept!

Really, the sharp script sets the tone here, but the acting and direction carry it along as well.

Some of the digital effects look a little cheesy, but the headlong pace hustles the viewer past them in a blink.

Otherwise the fight scenes are first rate, and little Hit Girl makes Go Go in ""Kill Bill"" look like a piker!

A great villain, likable hero, and interesting secondary characters all make an impression as well.

I have deducted a star only because this DVD has NO extras -- no commentary, making of, casting discussion, nada.

This film deserves much better, and with any luck a tenth-anniversary edition will make amends.  I'm sorry I'll have to wait ten years to add this to my collection!",1280880000,2,797,4.690647482014389

4033679,5,B002ZG9846,"First off, I saw this in the theatre with my two teenagers and we loved this movie. This is a great film with a reality twist to it. I could not wait for the blu-ray to hit my house. We have watched it twice since it got here, today. All the people who gave it 1 star just complain about the violence and cursing. I have a suggestion for them. DO NOT WATCH RATED R MOVIES. Oh, and you shouldn't watch any show on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Starz. You see these channel have a ton of shows that have cursing, violence and sex (the trifecta of badness, LOL).

Anyway, this movie is about a kid that wants to be a hero because he is tired of just watching bad things happen around him. After trying it for a while he runs into some real heroes and decides it is too much for him. He is pulled back into it because the bad guy wants to make an example of him to the world. The story ends in triumph and with a warm and fuzzy feeling for all. This movie may not be anexact replica of the comic book, just as Watchmen wasn't an exact replica of its comic book. But if you know anything about the movie industry you would understand that not everything translates to the big screen from the written word.

If you want to see some good action and a good story line than this movie is for you. It does not disappoint and the fact that all the 1 star reviews are just complaints about violence and cursing shoud let you know it is a good rated R movie.",1280793600,,1443,4.077464788732394

4033681,5,B002ZG9846,"Most of the other reviews (and Amazon description) have already gone over the movie/storyline, so I'll focus on just the Blu-Ray itself and my thoughts of the movie.

I really enjoyed this one - after hearing much about it while it was in theaters, I had pretty high hopes/expectations for it and I can honestly say I wasn't let down by them (something rare!). I thought the movie was well paced with a good amount of action, comedy and storyline.. plus the characters were great! Something enjoyable by people of most ages (though you might wanna leave the kids out for this one).

One of the big surprises here was the Blu-Ray itself.. I guess I wasn't expecting too much, but Lionsgate really delivered. Clarity is incredible and has some nice (saturated) colors throughout. Almost comparable to Gamer and the Crank films on Blu-Ray with just how nice it looked. An easy 5/5 for me.

Audio was also top notch - nicely uses all the speakers and will give a home theater a real workout.  I believe this was another DTS-HD MA 7.1 track from Lionsgate.

Extras don't stop either.. you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and a Digital Copy (for your iPod/iPhone/iPad). I know some don't care for the DVD or Digital copy, but I'm definitely a fan. It's also got the in-movie-experience (always fun and really show off the blu-ray), commentary and some behind the scenes extras.

Overall a fantastic package that I have to give a 5/5 to in each category. Movie, Video, Audio, Extras. Check it out!",1280793600,2,1479,4.6692307692307695
4033682,4,B002ZG9846,"Such is KICK-ASS: over-the-top, hilarious, brutally violent.  It chronicles the rise (if we want to call it that) of the titular hero, whose secret identity is almost a nonentity: Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a nobody at his high school, pining after a girl who thinks he's gay.  When Dave dons his superhero costume (a green and yellow wetsuit) and starts kicking butt, he becomes an Internet sensation.  But other people take notice: Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Most noticeably, there's crime kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) just wants in on the family business, even if it means making a friend and subsequently betraying him.  All of these culminates in a bloody, brilliant show-down.

At the heart of KICK-ASS (and there is a heart) is the notion that only social misfits and people unsatisfied with their lot in life would ever don a costume.  No one in this film is perfect; Dave is lost and looking for himself, and both Big Daddy and Hit Girl are sociopaths; they make D'Amico (who microwaves a guy alive) look tame.  But that's the genius of KICK-ASS: it never takes itself seriously, so you never get the idea that it's promoting (or condemning, for that matter) violence.  The film (and graphic novel) just IS: it's here for your entertainment, and make of it what you will.

Matthew Vaughn's directing is solid, as is the script; but the film hinges entirely upon the performances, as most films of this kind do.  Graphic violence and dark humor will only get you so far--as evidenced by the fact that the film falls away in the middle, as the violence slowly overtakes the humor.  Thankfully, we have solid performances, mainly from the supporting cast; Johnson is fine, but he couldn't have carried this film alone.  We have Mark Strong as the villain, menacing and hilarious at the same time; Strong has a knack for sinking his teeth into this sort of role.  As D'Amico's son, Mintz-Plasse manages to break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked ""hero"" Red Mist.  But it's really the teaming of Cage and Moretz that will be remembered.  Cage is delightfully over-the-top, going from aw-shucks to Dark Knight and back again.  Moretz is a wonder; easily the most controversial part of the film (and that's saying a lot, considering the level of violence here), she spouts obscenities and slits throats with a grace that's rarely seen in these films (also in time with the requisite rock 'n roll soundtrack; Vaughn getting his Tarantino on).  It's Hit Girl this film will be most remembered for, but really, the whole cast deserves a round of applause.  Even with the stellar source material, even with a fine script and directing and choreography, this film could easily have tanked.  As is, it stands as a great entry into the superhero cannon, both parodying the genre and trying to explain some of its appeal.  It is dark, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and violent: everything you could want on a Friday night.",1280793600,,3069,4.8522072936660265
4033683,4,B002ZG9846,"Be warned: this review contains mild spoilers.

Aside from Hollywood's neverending quest to remake every movie from the past fifty years, film producers have been in an unapologetic superhero mode since the late nineties, cranking out favorites from X-Men to Spider Man and back again (they're rebooting Spidey, you know). Still even more are on the way, evidenced by news of the upcoming Avengers and Green Hornet movies. As a result nearly every marginally successful comic book or graphic novel one can imagine has been optioned for a cinematic adaptation. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable. Sometimes we receive an emotionally gripping, contemporary classic like ""Road to Perdition"" (also, coincidentally, released on Blu-Ray today). Other times we're presented with godawful tripe like ""Whiteout"". The less said about that one, the better.

Personally I think it's a good thing, as there are dozens of sharply original, brilliantly innovative graphic novels that have yet to enjoy life on the silver screen. Every comic fan has their wishlist of favorites they'd like to see reinvented visually, and my personal choices are the ""Preacher"" and ""Grendel"" series. I'd love to see what a visceral director like Zach Snyder could do with either of those properties. But the trend in the comic book world isn't focused so much on actual heroes anymore, it's gradually shifted towards the 'everyman does the incredible' template.

We certainly see this trend manifested in ""Kick Ass"", as well as films like ""Defendor"" and the more recent ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"". I must admit, even being a comic fan, ""Kick Ass"" never featured on my list of most wanted comic-films. It's somewhat original, in that there hasn't been a deluge of comics revolving around a kid who decides overnight to become a costumed crimefighter, but the comic itself was a bit on-the-nose in its themes and more than a little puerile in tone. I found it pleasant light reading but rather forgettable. The problem is that there's absolutely nothing deeper going on other than what's on the page, and as a result it's something one could read and fully comprehend whilst simultaneously watching television or chatting on the telephone (both of which I did).

Of course, I'm fast approaching 30, and it's clear this film is primarily targeted towards those in their early-to-mid teenage years (which bizarrely clashes with the hard R rating, I might add). There's the by-the-numbers plotting, cookie cutter gangster stereotypes, and a youthful cast of socially inept comic loving geeks and stunningly attractive girls. In the end, ""Kick Ass"" is a much less depressing film than ""Defendor"" and plotwise it even manages to be less ridiculous than ""Scott Pilgrim"", but it never quite rises above the barely-adequate comic that inspired it.

The performances are strong, particularly Aaron Johnson as our everyman crimefighter Kick Ass and Chloe Moretz as the pre-teen, foul-mouthed baddie assassin Hit-Girl. Nicolas Cage is the greatest surprise here, being without question the most famed member of the cast, but also known for his occasionally spotty performances. Here, he masterfully plays a slightly twisted but unquestionably devoted father by day and the Batman-inspired Big Daddy by night, replete with awkward Shatner-esque pauses in his speech. Mark Strong can always portray a convincing villan, and his role here as gangster leader Frank D'Amico is no different. Sadly, the immensely talented Jason Flemyng is inexplicably wasted (his total screentime amounts to under two minutes).

Even worse, the greatest detriment to the film is director Matthew Vaughn, primarily known for his close collaborations with Guy Ritchie and for directing both ""Layer Cake"" and ""Stardust"". Though ""Layer Cake"" is a fine British gangster thriller, Vaughn has been riding the coattails of Richie's success for far too long now. Here, for instance, Vaughn confuses overused tropes with stylistic innovation, inserts obnoxious licensed music tracks where they're not required, and splices the action scenes with so many cuts it's impossible to tell what's really going on.

Thankfully, the crew in ""Kick Ass"" helpfully provided explosive CGI blood spurts to let the audience know who is getting killed in what fashion. Nothing in the action scenes, however, is as eye-melting and seizure-inducing as the extended sequence in which Hit-Girl activates a strobe feature on the flashlight attachment to her pistol. The resultant fast-paced flashes of bright white light against a pitch black background will cause most in a darkened theater room to shield their eyes in anguish for an effect that essentially strangles any possible excitement out of the scene to begin with.

But the crux of the problem with ""Kick Ass"" is its wildly uneven tone, as if Vaughn could never truly decide just what sort of film he wanted to create. The film begins by engaging the viewer in a series of silly slapstick gags along with some lowbrow teenage humor from its high-school age cast, then suddenly thrusts the audience into the realm of bloody, brutal violence when a character is stabbed in the torso. As he staggers away, bleeding profusely, he's subsequently struck by a speeding car. The film strangely expects the audience to suddenly feel genuine pathos for characters the film itself never took very seriously to begin with.

It's not only the one instance, either, the film consistently flip-flops between being violent, dark, and deadly solemn to being too ridiculously silly and absurd to take seriously. Another example would be the gangster characters, who are generally quite dopey and have names that sound as if they were inspired by the Seven Dwarves or the Spice Girls (i.e. Sporty Goon, Scary Goon, Baby Goon, etc.). That makes them sound like amusing and inept Dick Tracy villans, but these characters frequently spew foul language and commit cold-blooded murder. Suffice it to say that the moments ""Kick Ass"" ceases to take itself so seriously are always the best scenes in the film.

The score to ""Kick Ass"" is really quite good, the very few moments it's allowed to make an appearance. The bulk of the film's soundtrack is comprised of licensed music tracks, which form a trippy mix of every genre in the book. It's painfully obvious they were stretching to achieve a highly stylized look and sound akin to Snyder's work, but Vaughn doesn't have the chops for this sort of thing. For every skillfully used track (i.e. the amusing scene in which the boys are cruising to the sounds of ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley) there are three others that sound wholly out of place. Some film school teacher somewhere must still be instructing their students that placing decades-old classic crooner ballads within bloody, violent action sequences is still trendy, stylish, or otherwise interesting. Snyder did it with ""Watchmen"", and now Vaughn has inserted Elvis Presley's ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" during a climatic sequence in which Kick Ass is piloting a rocketpack with dual gatling guns blazing away.

The Blu-Ray is presented by Lionsgate in a fittingly color-rish transfer that, while certainly not benchmark material, looks quite sharp and detailed. Included within the case are three discs: the Blu-Ray, a DVD containing a standard definition copy of the film, and the ubiquitous digital copy on the third disc. There are five special features on the Blu-Ray disc, which are as follows:

1) ""Ass Kicking Bonusview Mode"" - An feature-length interactive commentary with director Matthew Vaughn that also includes bonus footage and interview excepts. To give a better idea - this offers the same basic function as the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" on Warner Bros. titles such as ""Sherlock Holmes"", ""Watchmen"", ""Terminator Salvation"", or ""Cop Out"". Vaughn's solo commentary track is also included sans the bells and whistles.

2) ""A New Kind of Superhero: The Making of Kick Ass"" (1:53:04) - A sprawling making-of feature that covers every aspect of production, from casting to sound effects and even smaller details such as finding a suitable distributor for the film.

3) ""It's On: The Comic Book Origins of Kick Ass"" (20:36) - This turned out to be my personal favorite feature, one which (obviously) covers the source material of the film.

4) ""Marketing Archive"" - Includes two trailers (including the controversial redband Hit-Girl trailer) and a fairly extensive gallery of movie posters.

5) ""The Art of Kick Ass"" - A huge photo gallery covering all aspects of the film's production.

Ultimately, ""Kick Ass"" is an entertaining, action-packed summer film that nearly any teenager (or excessively youthful adult) is bound to revel in. My attention was held for the entire two hours, which is more than I can say for a good deal of recent flicks (I'm looking at you, ""Repo Men"") and despite my quibbles the film often amused me. The film has such an excellent, original premise that it's unfortunate the execution was somewhat botched.

With that in mind, fans certainly won't be disappointed with the Blu-Ray presentation, but I'd advise a rental to those who haven't gotten around to seeing it yet. Were it not for Vaughn's scattershot directing, I would've been able to offer a much stronger recommendation. So, considering I'm not a member of this film's intended demographic, and it's certainly never boring, I think 3.5 stars is a fair rating (rounded up to 4 in light of Amazon's rating limitations). Besides, there was a time when I would've adored this film, it simply arrived fifteen years too late for me.",1280793600,,9585,5.133333333333334

4033727,1,B002ZG9846,"Before you say anything about premature reviews (as the official release date is next week), I have received this DVD today from a retailer who ships DVDs well before the official release.

And now that we got that part out of the way, let's cut to the chase: The dynamic range of this DVD's audio track is compressed beyond recognition, i.e. every single scene in this movie has the exact level of loudness, which is especially annoying during action scenes. They even seem quieter than the scenes surrounding them and lack any sort of bass! Normally, action scenes should be the loudest part of a movie, here it is the other way around. I have played this DVD on two separate systems, and both showed the same results, so it definitely is an issue with the DVD itself. It also is not an issue with the movie. In the theater, everything sounded as it should sound.
The DVD almost sounds like the action scenes were edited separately from the rest because they also don't have any bass (the other scenes do have bass).

And to add insult to injury, this DVD has a form of copy protection that violates the DVD standard, i.e. some players, and especially computers, might not even play this disc!

I love this movie, but this DVD manages to screw it up really good. I have never heard anything like this on a DVD (and I have a rather large collection). Please abstain from buying this until Lionsgate decides to release a corrected version.

4033729,4,B002ZG9846,"What can be said about Kick-Ass the movie... I thought it was a pretty damn good movie. I'm always on the fence when Hollywood decides to make a comic into a movie mostly because I'm always afraid they're going to butcher it (images of 'Wanted' flashing before eyes) so I usually end up watching them just to be sure that they paid the proper respect to the original story (Welcome images of 'Watchmen' flash before eyes). With Kick-Ass, they stayed pretty true to the original story even as far as the ultra violence goes because if you read the issues, it's pretty brutal. They deviated significantly with ""Big Daddy's"" story and also the relationship between Dave Lizewski (Kick-Ass) and Katie Deauxma his ""love interest"". I guess American audiences aren't quite ready to see how those stories truly unfolded cuz they most definitely did NOT happen the way the movie portrayed them but regardless, I still think they did a pretty damn good job with the movie. They went in a different direction adding a comedic element to the movie but that worked cuz throughout the movie I remember being shocked by the violence (in a good way) and also laughing quite a bit throughout. They definitely went a bit overboard with the whole jet pack gattling gun at the end there but all in all it's definitely worth the buy.

4033731,5,B002ZG9846,"I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I loved the Chris Nolan Batman films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Watchmen/dp/B001FB55H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Watchmen</a>, Iron Man, and the first 2 Spider-man films, but I didn't know anything about Kick-Ass when it came out in theaters. Only one of my friends had seen it, and I didn't hear any buzz about this film except the mainstream press criticizing it for its gratuitous violence. I was turned off by the ugly poster art and poor marketing, thinking it was some cheesy knock-off of the Watchmen.

Boy, was I wrong. Having just watched it, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite films of 2010. It's an entertaining and suspenseful action movie with lots of guns and tons of violence. It's an anti-hero movie. The main character, Dave, sucks at being a superhero. He's just an ordinary high school kid with a dumb green costume made out of a wetsuit he bought online. The only thing he has going is an extraordinary ability to get his ass beaten on a regular basis because of his gross lack of fighting skills. A third of the way into the film, he is saved from certain death by two real superheroes, Big Daddy and Hit Girl and their story arcs converge. Big Daddy (who dresses like Batman/Night Owl) and Hit Girl are father and daughter, two highly-skilled vigilantes out to settle a personal score with drug kingpin Frank D'Amico. Nick Cage, who I'm not normally fond of, I liked in this film as Big Daddy. 13 year old Chloe Moretz plays Hit Girl. She is both adorable and deadly. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as annoying as ever.

Visually, Kick-Ass is superb. It's stylish and super-violent in the same way that the Watchmen was violent and stylish (but not nearly as violent as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Assasin/dp/B0035V35PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Assasin</a>). Lots of people die in fancy, inventively-choreographed and cleverly shot ways. There's a ridiculously over-the-top John Woo-styled clip reloading/gun catching sequence and a mini-gun/jet-pack at the end, but it's all in good fun. Gun geeks will also drool over all the hardware hanging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket). Lots of blood. Lots of stabbings. One guy even gets blown up in a microwave. If you don't like violence, stay far away from this movie.

Story-wise, Kick-Ass shares many similarities with the Nolan Batman films, The Watchmen, Spider-man, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-The-Professional/dp/B002O5M4SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon: The Professional</a>&nbsp;in that the heroes are human and fallible.

4033733,5,B002ZG9846,"I have to say, with the blue ray coming out that this is a great movie.  What you have in the movie are a group of really bad people who are doing bad things, all the time and no one is stopping them.  This is What the kick ass character is about.  Now many who like this movie think that his part is actually the weakest.  I disagree.  It is through his eyes that the dilemma of good people is observed, and he shows the difference between himself and the serious nature of the really bad people.  Good people have a lot to lose to the bad guys.  That is why it is so easy to do nothing in the face of evil.  Kick Ass learns that lesson.  He also acts as the important contrast to Hit Girl and Big Daddy.  Hit Girl and Big Daddy are also great.  They deal with the bad guys without the self doubt typically forced onto hero characters.  The people they kill are evil.  Really evil.  I am not very good with words so I'll send you to two reviews that really touch on why this movie is great.  John Nolte at Andrew Breitbarts Big Hollywood website gives a good review of the film.  John Nolte also takes on Roger Eberts review of the film and details why Ebert is a hypocrite when it comes to Hit Girl and the reviews of other movies.  Check out the other reviewer at Brietbart's site.  He called Kick Ass one of the best Libertarian films of all time.  To those people who are implying things about Hit Girl, her costume and her language, you're wrong.  People complained about the violence against an 11 year old girl.  99 percent of the violence is Hit Girl killing bad guys.  She simply shows no remorse about killing evil people.  As to her costume, she is actually modestly dressed, the skirt is there to show she is a girl, but she is in a full costume besides that.  Her language is bad because the hollywood type who wrote the script is an adolescent in an adult body and couldn't help himself.  It does differ from the source material but it does so by improving on the source material.  The story now makes much more sense and is not as teenager driven as the comic book.  I have to say, the scene of the rescue is great as is the final battle with a small exception.  The music and the images in this movie really complement each other.  It is an adult movie but it is a good one.",1279584000,4,2291,4.178489702517163

All the negative posts are people who are just genuinely uncomfortable in their own skins. For ages women have been complaining about be portrayed as weak, needing saving and being victimized. Well I say, those days are long gone. Nope, it wasn't a Fonda clone doing a killer spy gig, it was a 11 year old girl fighting the hard fight (and lets face it, her crusade wasn't meant to make another Martha Stewart) for her Dad and dead Mother (if it were you who'd been done so bad you'd be proud of your kid for getting it done, real naked American can-do spirit here. raw and unapologetic). Hit Girl, Hit Girl, (lord bless her) Hit Girl is a heroine for the 21st century where a terrorist might have to think 5 times. Yeah we give em' cell phones, music, home electronics and sugar up the a$$ and I say it's these things that combined make the toxic stew that are the ingredients that cause the typical superhero origin story that spawned Hit Girl... Life is hard and it helps to carry a loaded 11 year old. This movie is like what makes you wake up those mornings and wonder if there is any possible way to return to that crazy dream you just had. Pure voyeurism and anti convention, you want to talk about disturbing cinema with kids in it as main characters, rent ""The Tin Drum"" (a German import) and you'll see this movie in another light I promise you... Why are Americans sooooo worried about our widdle kiddies getting bad ideas from movies? Hello, Columbine and all the other would-be Hit Kids who've blown away real people waaaaaaaaaaaaaay before this comic/movie was ever conceived might just have you thinking, ""Art DOES imitate life"" and in this case, real life was there first and way more brutal and evil...

4033858,5,B002ZG9846,All those who have their panties in a bunch because this movie did what so many other super-heroes failed to do should stick with reading Golden Age comics. This is one of my favorite comic book movies and definitely the best movie of 2010. I read the graphic novel prior to watching the movie and I loved both equally. Everyone in it was cast perfectly even the sort of bland Nick Cage as Big Daddy. The changes in the plot for the movie worked well and I cannot wait to read the next installment and hopefully the next movie.,1278460800,2,527,4.333333333333333
4033859,2,B002ZG9846,"Yes, the film/book is decidedly and wonderfully non-PC. Yes, Matthew Vaughn has a distinct visual style and has a sense of humor when it comes to musical cues. Yes, Chloe Moretz is great as Mindy/Hit-Girl. And yes, you can make a successful film based on a comic without sticking straight-up to the source material.

But here's the problem. KICK-ASS (at least this volume) is a limited series. When you have decades of mythology, you can play with that a little and still make a great film (SUPERMAN 1 and 2, The Nolan BATMAN films, the first 2 X-MEN films, the first 2 SPIDER-MAN films... and more). But when you have a mini-series, like WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL (basically anything adapted from an Alan Moore original work)... and you screw around with the plot, characters, and the moments that make those comics transcendental of the four-color genre, you lose most of, if not ALL of the things that make those titles great... which all of those afore-mentioned films did. KICK-ASS, as a comic, lasted for eight issues and those eight issues were great fun. It didn't take itself terribly seriously, and it made you laugh at its extremes. But it worked. There was no futuristic technology, no powers... just people with tazers, clubs, guns and swords. And that was it.

Now, as we follow Dave Lizewski on his journey to become the first fanboy-turned-superhero, we're intrigued and amused at how much he sucks at fighting crime. Then when he does something sort of right, his antics are caught on YouTube and masked heroes become a sensation. Satiricially, this is a brilliant setup.

But then the filmmakers, and to some extent, the original writer Mark Millar himself, decided to screw around with this story, and add, change, or remove  elements that took away from some of the things that made the book great.

And I was lost. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this film decided to stray from the source material so heavily in three major moments: The actual origin of Big Daddy (which is VERY different in the book), the ""love"" story between Dave and his crush, and the finale. Well, one particular moment in the finale that COMPLETELY took me out of the film and just made me shake my head in disappointment. Hint: it involves technology that does NOT exist in our real world.

And Christopher Mintz-Plasse? Trying tooooooo hard. And I'm just so tired of Nicolas Cage. He should have retired after he won his Oscar, because he hasn't turned in anything vaguely resembling a good performance since then, with the exception of FACE/OFF.

These were all things that hit me after the credits for the film rolled and I was on my way out to the parking lot, but they were major differences that were done for purely stylistic purposes, and did nothing but hurt the chances for this film to be everything it could have been.

I try really hard not to be a purist, because I know that films can stand apart from their source material, but when you change things that work in the place of things that don't... that's when you really screw your film up. And that's what happened with KICK-ASS.",1278288000,5,3150,4.7249544626593805
4033860,5,B002ZG9846,"Kiss-ass isn't perfect and it isn't for everyone.  It's rated R for good reason.  That being said it pushes escapism to new levels and renders a comic book as close to the source material as u may ever see.  The movie, like most based on comic books is a story of good versus evil.  Evil here in the form of mob boss Frank D'Amico, played well by Mark Strong who seems to have claimed the niche Gary Oldman once held as bad guy of choice.  The good rests in two camps. Dave, a hapless teen who becomes Kick-ass because he believes in a world where super heroes help people, and a pair of vigilantes named Big Daddy and Hit-girl.  Dave, whose efforts to help usually end up in him getting beat up and the vigilante paths cross while Dave is doing a favor for the girl of his dreams.

The movie features the usual funny school friends and the heroes quest for the love of a girl that he cant have.  What makes this movie special is its hero.  Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are well trained and well armed killing machines.  Big Daddy is so bent on vengeance he has stolen her childhood of his daughter and turned her into a tiny terminator.  They  have the power, the resources and the skill.  Dave has nothing like that.  Dave cares.  Dave tries and fails and keeps trying.  He isn't a comic book hero like the other two.  Dave's a real hero like a soldier or a cop on the street.  He helps despite his lack of power because its the right thing to do.

Aaron Johnson is perfect as Dave and eleven year old Chloe Moretz (Hit-Girl)is headed for long, star studded career.  If u want to appreciate how good the young girl is turn the sound off and just watch her.  Her facial expressions, the way  she carries herself convey her character as well as her lines do.  The score perfectly mirrors the action as if the actors had performed to the music.",1278201600,2,1837,4.291545189504373
4033861,1,B002ZG9846,"Here's the deal... if you enjoyed this movie there is a pertty good chance you're in teen's up to your thirties... still living with your parents and collecting comic books. If you find it cool that a 12 year old girl gets beeaten up, you should get your head examined. Here's the thing, most successful comic book writers are successful because they use violence and controversy to promote their works. They can only generate one form genre for their work and therefor is limited to what they can achieve. For example, Frank Miller, a 'successful' comic book writer/artist, did a couple of movies with hardcore violence... where is he now? He can't generate any new ideas outside the violent frame-work and therefor, it's safe to say, his career in the film industry is exhausted. Same thing goes for Mark Millar, the comic book writer for Kick-Ass, can't write for his life outside the comic book industry. A perfect example of this is that even the flm script had to be written by someone else. Sure he won some award for comic book writer or whatever, but those awards are equivalent to a farmer getting a 'best tomato grower' award at a carnival. As to this 'Millar World' created a few years back, promising new and exciting things... I'm still waiting.

4033862,5,B002ZG9846,"One of my pet peeves about most comic book movies is the way they have a tendency to play down to the teens rather than the adults.  That's fine, and that's the target audience, and that's the nature of the beast.  However,Kickass manages to be a comic book story for adults.  This gives the movie a depth that most comic book movies (heck, most movies period)tend to lack.  Particularly that movies with explosions tend to lack.  Kickass is far more relevant to a conversation about the responsibility of a single person to make society better than anything since Watchmen (the graphic novel, not the movie).  And I hate to say it, because I loved that graphic novel, but Kickass does it better.

Very simply, this is about a kid who gets fed up with seeing violence and decides to do something about it.  He runs into several other masked individuals and ends up embroiled in a lot of violence, mayhem and hilarity.  And that's worth saying again.  Kickass is flipping hilarious.  Sometimes you're laughing while simultaneously feeling disgusted with yourself for laughing, but that doesn't mean you aren't having a good time.

However, bear in mind that the violence here is pretty graphic sometimes.  And while I adore Hit Girl, and totally want to be her when I grow up (which is sad, cause I'm already in my thirties), a lot of folks might have trouble with her character arc.  It gets a bit bloody, and if you're sensitive to violence with kids, this isn't the movie for you.

Strangely enough, though, Kickass also manages to be warm--you get to see characters who are legitimately trying to make the world a better place, and sometimes they fail miserably. I'll be honest that at one particular point, I was almost moved to tears.  This is one of the rare films that I've seen this year that have actually walked that perfect line of heartfelt emotion, a mix of sophisticated laughter and laughter at someone who got kicked in the balls, and some truly kick ass action sequences.",1278028800,2,1988,4.702312138728324

""Kick-Ass"" is not for everyone, but if you don't mind swearing (lots!) and violence, then you'll probably get a kick out of ""Kick-Ass.""

He ends up getting caught up in something that is much bigger than him, getting framed by a father/daughter superhero gang for killing some mob members.

Displaying incredible courage-slash-unbelievable stupidity, he persists in his mission and is drawn into a war between a drug kingpin (Mark Strong) and a couple of Batman and Robin knockoffs, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), who is the real thing.

Some may be put off by the violence and profanity, particularly since many of the characters are so young, so be warned: this film deserves its R rating.  If that doesn't bother you, you're in store for a very funny comedy with plenty of exuberant action scenes. Moretz steals the show and Cage is hilarious channeling Adam West while in his Big Daddy persona.  Johnson is low-key but likeable, which is just what his character requires.",1276819200,2,1026,4.907514450867052
4033959,2,B002ZG9846,"To be honest, I loved this movie...for what it was. A light-on-content, heavy-on-style, action-packed romp on the dark side with some humor thrown in. However, compared to what it could have been, and even more so what it obviously, desperately wanted to be, I can really only give it 2 stars.

First of all, the premise is great. A nerdy teenage nobody wants to rise above his status and be someone special. Sure, being a real life superhero is not a feasible means to achieve this, but what could be learned from that? Maybe that you don't need to be a superhero to do great things, just an ordinary person with a vision and some courage? Why not explore the Hit Girls and Big Daddys of the  world who feel wronged and overlooked and retaliate in negative ways, such as teenage school shooters or lovers who kill out of jealousy? There are a lot of things that could have been done with this, but the producers didn't bother.

The moments with Kick-Ass are genuinely funny, especially his naive, good-intentioned grandiosity. An outcast teen on a mission could have been a really sympathetic character if developed properly, but he wasn't. He was overshadowed by an aforementioned 11-year-old killer.

Where oh where do I begin with Hit Girl? I'll admit, her attitude and actions sequences were fun to watch and I was imitating her for days (in private, of course.:) But on reflection, what did Hit Girl add to the story? There was no real motivation for her character to be that way. We just are supposed to take for granted that this is normal and acceptable for little girls and their fathers, which ruins my attachment to and belief in those characters.

Furthermore, I AM offended by this film, like a lot of other reviewers. The violence, profanity, and other ""adult"" elements were excessive. I'm far from prudish, but at some point, it gets to be distasteful and loses its shock value after a while. Which wouldn't bother me so much if it was well-done, added to the story, and had sufficient moral context/criticism, but it doesn't. Hit Girl especially is offensive to me because it's glaringly, painfully obvious that the audience is supposed to be blown away by her ultra-feminist edginess. I'm a woman who can fight with the boys and beat up grown men just like that! I have a perfect body, am totally athletic, oh so cute, and am as tough and unladylike as can be.  I always get what I want. Oh, and at the end, I'm so smart that I can get into high school right without any formal  education whatsoever! Best of all, I'm only 11! Are you as great as me at 11? Take that, patriarchy!

As an 11-year-old, I might have collapsed under the weight of 3rd-wave feminist pride. As an older woman, however, I find this utterly unrelatable and an insult to my intelligence.

Chloe Moretz herself isn't a bad actress. She loves and cares about her role, which makes her that much more fun to watch. (If the actors don't care, why should we?)She does over/underact in a lot of scenes, but she dominated other scenes and has potential in general. I'll pass judgment on her when I see her in more substantial roles. She's got a way to go yet.

Acting overall was hit-or-miss with all of the characters, but especially Hit Girl and Big Daddy. The teenage boys, Red Mist, and Frank D'Amico stole the show in this area, in my opinion. The teenage girls, in writing and in acting, were the worst of the bunch and just unlikeable. What I found appealing about Red Mist in particular was how he straddled the line of good and evil. He was also one of the more realistic characters.

Production values are clearly low-budget, but I actually think this enhances the quality of the film. It gives it a cartoonish feel that I find entirely appropriate for a movie based on a comic book. It also softens the blow of the many brutal murders that would have otherwise been unwatchable.

By the way, I write and produce ""offensive"" media of all kinds for a living and as a passion. So dissenters are going to have to do better than throw the old ""You're such a prude"" line in my face.

So feel free to buy this DVD and watch it while you're cleaning the house, winding down from work, etc. But for best results, turn your brain off first if you're 16 or older. If you're younger than that, you really shouldn't be watching at all except, perhaps, with adult supervision.",1276732800,11,4358,4.5717948717948715
4033960,5,B002ZG9846,"******* SPOILERS ABOUND *******

The above line is not uttered in the new blockbuster superhero movie, KICK ASS, but believe me, you won't miss it. The exclamation comes at the climax of the graphic novel, where Hit Girl dispatches bad guys into the after life like a pint sized cute as a button grim reaper!

If ever there was a title that encompasses all that a movie rises to the occasion to be, KICK ASS is most definitely it! This film single handedly raises the bar for the superhero movie. Possessed of a great script, with fantastic acting all around (Nicholas Cage's Big Daddy rendering is both creepy and hilarious), and balls to the wall action set pieces, KICK ASS is in a class by itself.

Based on the graphic novel of the same name, KICK ASS tells the story of comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson, wonderful in the lead role), who wonders aloud one day to friends why no one has dared become a superhero. Of course, the answer to his query is simple - because they'd get their ass kicked. Undaunted, Dave orders a green scuba wet suit off E-Bay, and hurls himself into superhero daring do, only to get his ass kicked to the point of hospitalization. Anyone sane would have severed the idea in their skull of pursuing the mantle of superhero, but part of the premise of KICK ASS is just that - you'd have to be out of your damned mind to do it. And sho nuff, Dave licks his wounds and once more prowls the night streets to fight crime and is finally triumphant, and much to his surprise he becomes a You Tube celebrity. And then he meets the competition.

Where Kick Ass has more passion than prowess, Big Daddy and Hit Girl are the real thing; highly trained masked vigilantes on a mission of murder. When Hit Girl makes her entrance (the excellent Chole Moretz in an absolute break out role) the film turns the corner. Slicing and dicing bad guys like the Bride from Kill Bill as a preteen, Hit Girl steals the movie from the moment she appears. Cursing up a storm of expletives and possessed of martial art skills that are literally scalpel sharp, Hit Girl seals her iconic status as a screen heroine, or is that killer? This is the scene that had moral watchdog groups aghast, and no doubt this scene figured in Roger Ebert's giving the film one star - that's right one star. Moretz's Hit Girl is nothing short of astounding. When she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her.

Equally of note is Nicholas Cage's turn as Big Daddy. Many are calling this role his best in years. How does one pull off conveying a loving doting father one minute and a cold blooded killer the next? Cage does it with gusto. In what for me was one of the most disturbing scenes in the film, Cage channels the voice and mannerisms of the Adam West Batman. He and Hit Girl find where Kick Ass resides and try to convince him to team up with them. The scene is rather short but conveys a great deal. While watching I found myself thinking, this man is clearly insane and he's the father of a 12 year old murderess. Yep, KICK ASS is that twisted.

Before I go on let me offer a warning. This film is not for the even remotely squeamish. KICK ASS is reprehensible, decadent, sadistic, offensive, and uber violent and I loved every millisecond. I have no doubt it will go cult, and will be a guilty treat of many (for the fanboys it's already etched in stone). But hey, I stray.

At once reverential and at the same time pissing on the altar, KICK ASS alters the paradigm of the superhero movie. It is a breath of fresh air for a genre that can at times be ponderous (Watchmen, anyone?). It is a fast paced well written and acted thrill ride that offers something different for moviegoers glutted on the previous staple.

Believe me, if you love the genre you will love this film. The production values are exemplary, the action scenes at times are startling, the screenplay is a diamond, and the acting is consistently well done.

The awkward, otherwise nerdy outcast kid, who shows an inner strength
and inner beauty that inspires others in his community who would otherwise
mock him to find their own inner superheroes to effect change is the underlying
message of this film without being preachy about it.

When I saw him showing up to promos and opening nights for this movie

After all the initial bashing (due mainly to a little foul mouthed vicious little girl, lack of publicity and ""only"" US$100 mi box office flop) from american critics and reviewers  I guess KA is now considered a great film for many and watching it again only serves to reassure the genius of the direction and visionary idea. The way each action scene was filmed using different technics and style and was worked, cut and assembled along with some flawless thrilling soundtrack is phenomenal plus the dark sadistic unbelievable sense of humor, it is in my opinion a master-piece (doesn't necessarily have to be boring). Kick-Ass, Hit-Girl, Big Daddy, Red Mist and Frank D'Amico what a great team. I don't recall watching another movie as many times as KA, easilly over a 100 times, well maybe Superman about 40 times. I guess Millar and Vaughn have no idea what they accomplished together, and it's fun to see more and more positive reactions from people with many different tastes in movies.",1276214400,3,1069,4.747311827956989
4033995,5,B002ZG9846,"Going into kick-Ass I had some doubts because I feel this movie was poorly marketed since it seemed to be advertised for teenagers and the movie is obviously meant for adults. So after watching the movie I was extremely impressed I found it to be funny and action packed. I was expecting it to be funny, but not as action packed and dark as the trailers led me to believe. The movie being a little dark mainly the Big Daddy and Hit Girl parts made me fall in love with the movie instantly. I actually went to see the movie twice in the theaters and I barely go to a movie once let alone twice.

I can honestly say this is the 1st movie in a long time Nicolas Cage didn't piss me off since his character was perfect. But obviously the star of this movie his Hit-Girl, she steals every scene in the movie I don't know if it was the shock factor of how kick-ass she was or she was just perfect for the role. Either way this movie surprised me and was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

I say give it a chance and please this movie is not for kids despite how this movie was advertised which explains it's poor performance in the box office after it's great opening weekend. I can't believe parents took their children to see it when I was at the theater despite it's R rating. And they walked out angry and than bashed the movie on the internet. This was not meant for kids you are bad parents for ignoring the R rating. Also reason I mention this is because I have seen at too many sites parents complaining about this film.",1276214400,4,1539,4.1610738255033555
4033996,5,B002ZG9846,"To briefly summarize, ""Kick-Ass"" is the best comic book movie of the year (thus far)! Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 is a VERY close second, but ""Kick-Ass"" bests it simply because of its ability to be both serious and laugh at itself (not taking itself too seriously); in other words, what all Marvel movies try to do, but usually fail.

In Alan Moore's masterpiece graphic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/1401219268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>, Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) stated that the reason people started dressing up as costumed crimefighters was because of the criminals dressing in themed costumes, hence the superhero was born. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] film, Heath Ledger's Joker menacingly taunts Batman, stating: ""Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth: there's no going back. You've changed things... forever."" And from there, we know that Batman has inspired this new cache of supervillains in his world. Well, it's with that same inspiration that a lonely teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks, ""How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?"" From there begins a realistic, violent-yet-comic story of his attempt to become just that: a superhero called Kick-Ass.

What starts off as ""Kick-Ass"" just trying to clean up the streets becomes a tale of a scared kid who's in above his head as he tries to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of every hitman's gun under the orders of a mob boss (Mark Strong). Fumbling his way through his crimefighting career, Lizewski crosses paths with Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit-Girl (the EXCELLENT Chloe Moretz), other vigilante crimefighters who make him look like what he is: an amateur. Along the way, he also meets a friend (similar to James Franco's Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man films), Chris D'Amico (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and further develops his crush on Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).

There's been plenty of criticism about the film since it's release having to do with the supposed insult of Lizewski's dad being afraid that his son was gay; because that would be such a bad thing for a father to have to face (and yes, I'm being sarcastic with that statement). And the idea of Chloe Moretz's Hit-Girl being seen as a sex symbol as some moviegoers repeat a statement one of the characters, seeing her in action, declares, ""I think I'm in love with her!"" The ""gay controversy"" was reported by Entertainment Weekly. First of all, let's get this straightened out, Lizewski's dad in the film is scared by the idea that his son was prostituting himself, stripped naked and robbed ... not the mere fact that he was gay. Second, there will be boys who find Hit-Girl's dominating action as a turn-on, and that is disturbing, given her age (11-years-old). But, being as I'm not someone who views that as ""hot,"" but rather just as really cool, that aspect therefore doesn't enter my mind and doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the slightest. To all the naysayers, I say, ""Lighten up."" It's a film about a kid who poses as a superhero. It's to be taken with a grain of salt. Besides, would there be so much ""controversy"" if it were a boy who was kicking ass and shooting guns and cussing like a sailor? Also, in a world where there are very few young female crimefighters, Hit-Girl -- despite her age -- could be seen as a role model. She's tough, independent and completely confident. But more on her in a second.

Nevertheless, there are true themes of morality that pepper the story of Kick-Ass. The ever-present theme of ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" is tackled in various incarnations throughout. Let's revisit Hit-Girl and her double life. Damon Macready/Big Daddy's (Cage) quest for revenge on the death of his wife and the pathologically violent path it's taken his daughter Mindy Macready (Moretz) down is explored with great depth, as is the hazard of posing as a crimefighter/policeman/detective/etc. in a job that is extremely dangerous. The violence is plentiful and stylized as much as it is brutal and unforgiving. The question of a little girl crimefighter/vigilante is not ""Does she have the right?"" but rather is, ""Should a little girl of eleven-years-old be subjected to such violence?"" Well, first of all, again, it's a movie based on a comic book so it's whatever the writers want it to be. Secondly, if this were the real world (and being a father of two daughters), then no, she shouldn't be raised in such a matter. And the end of the film comes up with a way to address this issue. Either way, with the movies Moretz has been involved with (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-of-Summer-Blu-ray-with-Digital-Copy/dp/B001UV4XUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days of Summer [Blu-ray] with Digital Copy</a>&nbsp;and the upcoming U.S. remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-the-Right-One-In-Blu-ray/dp/B001MYIXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>] entitled ""Let Me In""), she shows great potential as an actress.

Overall, ""Kick-Ass"" is a fun film! It's got very adult situations (violence, language and a quicky sex scene thrown in for good measure), but from its dark humor beginning to its sequel-potential ending, Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Mark Millar's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted/dp/1582404976/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted</a>) comic hits all the right chords. I was skeptical about Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Red Mist, but he surprisingly played the part convincingly and believably. For fans of the comic who read the comic before seeing the movie (as I did), there are slight differences near the end -- that I can only think for the reason of satisfying the moviegoing masses -- that were changed. However, these changes don't greatly alter the quality of the story. It's been said there will already be a sequel based on Millar's second half of the comic series tentatively called ""Balls to the Wall."" Unfortunately, Millar won't be releasing that series for at least another year or so. Until then, the DVD release of ""Kick-Ass"" will have to suffice!",1276128000,5,6482,5.490981963927855

The movie is obviously geared towards us proud comicbook geeks who have wondered what might happen if one were to strap on a cape and beat up badguys (nothing good that's what). The hero learns the hard way that being a superhero is not all its cracked up to be and underneath the tights and utility belts they're alone and miserable. If anything the movie is a parable and object lesson to anyone considering doing the same thing.

Although starring Nicholas Cage and others, they're all upstaged by an 11 year old. Hit Girl (newcommer Georgia native Chloe Moretz)steals the show. Her scenes are by far the best not to mention most surreal. Example: her first fight scene when she slaughters an room full of gangstas all to the Banana Splits theme. The character is the absolute epitome of Girl Power.

There were two little boys in the theater and their mom complained the entire time(instaed of just taking them out of the movie). So if you are thinking about a night at the movies do a parental run through yourself 1st and go from there. Hit Girl delivers the dialogue of a trucker w/o even flinching which made it all the funnier for me. And she full on takes down every/anyone that gets in her way. Be it w/ guns or knives she is the victor. Don't get me wrong everyone else did their fair share of butt kickin' but she was by far the best.

4034000,5,B002ZG9846,"Just like the rest of you, I went into the theater knowing not a whole lot about this movie. I thought it would be lame, cheesy, corny, *insert adjective here*. But, I was DEAD wrong to say the least. Kick-Ass combines action, comedy, and emotion, all at the right times. The movie flows well mainly because the cast jives so well together. I have yet to come out of a movie theater so pumped and wanting more than after I came out of Kick-ass

Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass)- I didn't realize he was a British actor until I heard a voice clip from an interview. You sure can't tell from the movie. He plays a great nerdy type kid. But what separates him from actors like Michael Cera is that he actually grew some balls and decided to stand up to crime. He does a great job as the lead actor in the first half of the movie, but quickly gets overshadowed by young dynamo, Chloe Moretz

Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy)- In my eyes, he redeemed himself for movies like Ghost Rider and Knowing. He was amazing. His character was totally believable and I sure enjoyed his Adam West mannerisms. He also did his fair share of ass kicking. His relationship with his daughter, Hit-Girl, brought hilarity and the emotion that I mentioned earlier to this movie.

Lyndsey Fonseca (Katie Deauxma)- Hadn't seen her in a movie before. She is very beautiful and will be looking forward to seeing her in the sequel.

Chris Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist)- As much as I don't want to say it, Chris is out growing his McLovin' character. He, like Kick-Ass, plays a slightly awkward superhero with no powers. He fills his part well and has plenty of laugh out loud lines.

And, the best for last:

Chloe Moretz (Hit-Girl)- I honestly don't even know where to start with this girl. I would say she gives the performance of her life, but she was only 11 at the time of filming. She underwent 6 months of combat, acrobatic, and weapons training for her role as Hit-Girl in this movie. It paid off big time. Chloe does all her own stunts (minus 2) in the movie, which is insane. She is foul mouthed and bloodthirsty, but also has her kid moments. I don't understand the controversy with her character. She is very mature and thus should be able to do more mature roles. If you're not planning on seeing this movie, rethink, mainly because of this girl right here. She is incredible and will no doubt be the new Angelina Jolie when her time comes.

Overall, great movie. Great cast, great fight choreography, great soundtrack, and a great setup for a sequel! (Which has been announced)

See this movie, and then tell all your friends! It's totally worth the 2 hours of your time.",1274745600,143,2635,4.509433962264151

Genre: Action / Comedy
Release Date: 17 April 2010
Review Date: 22 April 2010

I think it's fair to say that most of us have seen a movie or two that displayed all of its greatest achievements in the trailer. This holds particularly true to films of the comedic genre. Kick-Ass however, had the exact opposite effect. Based on its trailer, I was more than skeptical. I was wondering what Nicolas Cage was doing in a film like this. Man, was I surprised.

The first 15 minutes or so had me let down and I was sure the film was gonna be a total drag. But then, out of nowhere, I was completely taken aback by a sharp turn in the tone of the film, and was rolling with laughter from there all the way to its hilarious climax. The fact that the trailer also led me to believe that it was only rated PG - 13, was another genuine treat. It's very much rated R.

Aaron Johnson stars as your everyday American high school kid, David. David fantasizes about his teacher, the hot girl in school, and of course what it would be like to have super powers. The latter causes him to ask himself why no-one has ever tried being a superhero without any powers. He shall like to be the first. He orders a costume off the internet and goes to work to fight crime.

He looks absolutely ridiculous in his hideous pine green and yellow ninja looking outfit, but that's what makes the film fun. It's called Kick-Ass folks, so if you are taking the time to watch the film, you can't exactly expect it to be Oscar-worthy now can you? Oh yeah, and it's called Kick-Ass, because that's the superhero name he deems himself with.

When David finds himself ready to due battle against two local punks, while dressed in his costume of course, we are rooting for him. We expect he will actually take be able to take them down. We expect pretty much anything other than what actually happens, to happen! This would be the 90 degree turn the film takes that I was referring to earlier. We go from a comedy, to a very dark comedy laced with buckets and buckets of blood brought forth from hilarious scenes of violence.

There are additional characters in the film, who I found even more appealing than David. Nicolas Cage plays a single father raising his 11-year-old daughter. We meet them in one of the most creative and humorous scenes that I have ever seen and I won't spoil it for you. It's safe to say that only Nicolas Cage could have pulled the scene off as good as he does, and still have us liking the character.

Cage and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) play Big Daddy and Hit Girl. They two are masked avengers of justice, and are far better at it than David. Their costumes are so B-rate, that they are in fact genius, and will no doubt be among the most popular come this Halloween.

Bid Daddy has trained Hit Girl to be the ultimate crime fighting machine. In addition to that, he's also taught her a long list of choice four-lettered words, to which she delivers with a classic juvenile charm.

What so many people have found absurd and offensive about this, is what I appreciated most about the film. The violence that is depicted here isn't exactly what you would call your everyday comic-book movie violence. Hit Girl and Big Daddy brutally murder every bad guy they come across. It may sound strange and twisted, but seeing it in this film, it is hysterical. Cage and Moretz are both sensational actors and are perfect for these roles. They steal the show in every scene and a star has been born in Chloe Moretz.

When a ruthless mob boss (Mark Strong) has had enough of the mysterious crime fighters spoiling his plans, he puts forth a counterstrike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.

There are a few things wrong with the film, and even though it's ridiculous, I know they could have written it better. Some jokes were missed and or executed poorly and at times the dialogue wasn't what it could have been either. Nonetheless there are so many genuine laughs, that we are still able to enjoy the film.

If you have been told you don't have an open mind, then skip this film. It has been ridiculed by far too many uptight cry-babies and it needs to stop. Don't sabotage a good thing. The film is absurd but it wants to be, and its fans prefer it to be. So leave it alone, or I'll (insert this film title with the word your implanted in the middle of it, and then smile.:)",1274400000,6,4699,4.459207459207459
4034002,5,B002ZG9846,"It hurts to be a hero. Bad guys have knives, good guys cause collateral damage, and the general public simply doesn't care. But it is ridiculously fun to watch how all this plays out in Kick-Ass, with someone else taking the hurt for us.

It is a simple story of a teenager (Aaron Johnson) so enamored with the fictional exploits of his comic-book heroes that he decides to become one. As Kick-Ass, what Dave Lizewski lacks in super-powers, he makes up for with two batons and lot of good intentions. Eventually, Lizewski finds aid and conflict in the form of two brutal vigilantes, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and the three set out to end the reign of a local crime boss (Mark Strong), who just so happens to be the father of an unlikely ally.

Indeed, `Kick-Ass' plays almost like an overlong homage to Spiderman: Alienated youth? Check. Unrequited love? Check. A friend with a murderous father? Check. However, whereas the tale of Spiderman, tragic as it may be, remains grounded in the realm of rose-tinted spandex, Kick-Ass chooses to dig deeper into the pathos, exploring the harsh realities of being a caped crusader in an all too familiar, disillusioned society.

Ironically, as the titular character, Johnson turns in what may very well be the picture's most forgettable performance. Forced to bumble around, jovially getting his `ass kicked', Johnson is less Peter Sellers than he is an even more depressing Peter Parker.

That isn't to say that Johnson doesn't acquit himself well enough, but honestly, could any man ever be expected to top Cage's eccentricity? With an Adam West impersonation of `Big Daddy', and a Don Knotts rendition for alter ego Damon Macready, perhaps the only time we really get to see Cage being his bizarre self is in a tragic, yet unintentionally hysterical scene, where Cage begins screaming (or is it singing?) unintelligible commands. Look up at the screen! Is he in pain? Is he in ecstasy? It's Nicolas Cage!

So leave it to a little girl to steal Cage's limelight. Turning in a career-making performance as the cutesy and murderous child-fatale, Moretz does for `Kick-Ass' what Yoda's unexpected martial artistry did for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Unabashedly violent and vulgar, Moretz may be very well be the youngest anti-hero of this, or any generation. That is not to say that it's hard to root for her. Indeed, Moretz may be the film's biggest draw even if for those very reasons alone!

Certainly, one won't be watching `Kick-Ass' for its borrowed visuals. It's too bad that director Matthew Vaughn chose not to further define his relatively new visual style, opting instead to mimic a nouveau Tarantino, and by extension, the expressions of many a Japanese and Spaghetti-Western director. Even the music, with its adrenaline pumping surf beats and kitschy tunes, seems an all too familiar experience, going as far to include a redressed track from '28 Days Later'.

Still, it is understandable, considering that the plot and characterizations mostly stand on borrowed legs, so too would the stylistic choices of the film. Otherwise, `Kick-Ass' rarely fails to disappoint, and as a parable on the dangers of being a hero in a world of red, `Kick-Ass' really does kick ass.",1274227200,5,3252,4.945054945054945
4034003,5,B002ZG9846,"The title of my review says it all. I'm not offended by foul language or the comic-style over-the-top violence in the film - if those things bother you, then don't go see this movie. Chloe Moretz gives a fantastic performance as the blood thirsty Hit Girl, whose presence elevates the film from ""pretty ok"" to ""un-freaking-believably awesome."" The violence, while intense, is rather bloodless and surreal; less realistic than another over-the-top movie favorite Crank. I've seen the movie three times and enjoyed it. The sound track is awesome too, although I don't know where the Elvis song was played during the movie.

Compared with the comic from which it arose, it is light hearted and the supposedly main protagonist Dave Lizewski (Kick-Ass) played by Aaron Johnson fares much better - he is only tortured a little ;-) and gets the hot girl in the end (not literally - get your mind out of the gutter).

Everyone in my family - including a 23yr old college student (male), a 17 yr old high school junior (also male), my wife (cannot disclose age under penalty of Bad Things Happening), and 14 year old daughter, and myself - all agree. Kick Ass kicks ass.",1274054400,6,1161,4.7711442786069655
4034044,2,B002ZG9846,"I really wanted to like KICK-ASS.  The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing.  But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.

But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick.  So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.

But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot.  For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.

I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS.  It could have been a really good, positive movie.  But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly.  Yes, there are some funny moments, and yes, the ending is actually satisfying, but overall, KICK-ASS is just disturbing, and I won't recommend it to anyone.",1273968000,6,1763,4.621794871794871

""Kick Ass"" is a bloody, violent action extravaganza that is smart enough to find its own footing, without being bogged down by censorship, and audience expectations. The highlight of the film is Hit Girl, who singlehandedly steals the spotlight from all her adult counterparts, including Kick Ass himself. This element of deconstruction, about how an 11-year-old girl could kill, maim, often bloody, with abandonment, and even with relish, is effective, for the most part. However, one of the main reasons why the film did not sit well with other people is in regards to the ethical implications of the character of Hit Girl, whom all fantasies, both carnal and violent, I'm sure, have been projected onto her on the big screen. However, though the deconstruction of the representation of superheroes and also our myriad of expectations coming from the typical way they are drawn is merely effective for the most part in this film, the lack of dramatic and emotional substantiality is what weakens the film, in regards to where it stands on ethics and morality. It does not matter if there is a lack of ethics and morality in the film, it is after all, a deconstruction, a satire, an overturning of the comic book and super hero genre. However, it seems to gloss it over at the end. Yes, this is a film about superheroes, but it does not mean that it could just skim over the emotional and dramatic nature; even flawed superheroes are just as humans as the viewers who root for them. Hit Girl appears to be merely shaken, not traumatized by the end. Sure, she has been efficiently trained to be like that; however, she is still a child. Even Batman in ""The Dark Knight"" had been given a chance to contemplate, Hit Girl has only been given a scene with her staring down at melted marshmallows floating in hot chocolate getting cold, a scene that does humanize her, but not enough. Having said that, ""Kick Ass"" is a great film, but it can only be truly appreciated by those who are able to understand it enough within a contextual postmodern realm, others will shrug it off as immoral and pointless.",1273536000,6,2235,4.748071979434448

After getting fed up with the crime in his city, though, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes his own masked hero: Kick-Ass, and becomes a local web and news sensation. Things aren't as easy as they seem for a juvenile crime fighter as he soon finds out, luckily he makes friends in the form of Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), a Batman-like vigilante, and his 11-year-old sidekick Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who aren't adverse to the idea of literally taking out the scum of the earth. But when members of his crew start turning up dead, drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a price on Kick-Ass's head.

Mark Millar is an acclaimed comic writer best known for Wanted (which became the movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy) and his take on an alternate reality where Kal-El landed in the Soviet Union instead of America called Superman: Red Son. For Kick-Ass, Millar went back to conversations him and his brother had about becoming masked vigilantes, and took the conversation a step further and looked into what would actually happen if a teenager actually decided to take that step. As Millar got working on that comic, he also started working with Matthew Vaughn (director of Layer Cake, producer for Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells) on some early ideas for Thor, but when Vaughn left Thor he started talking to Millar about his other comics. What started out as a plan to adapt American Jesus (Millar's sequel to the Bible) soon turned to conversations about Millar's still in the planning stage Kick-Ass.

Kick-Ass is the anti-comic book comic book movie. It skewers the genre while also paying loving homage to them. It would be all to easy to say it's a spoof of the genre, because while at times it may poke fun at the genre (remember that scene in Spider-Man where Peter Parker runs across a rooftop and jumps to the next roof, there's a spoof of that) it still also takes it's place amongst it's comic book peers with all seriousness. Kick-Ass is a very dark movie, not afraid of withholding the violence that a choice of vigilante crime fighting will lead to, even if that means beating an 11-year-old girl. This is graciously offset by a lot of comedy, chances are if you're not cringing from people's limbs getting hacked off or their heads exploding (yes there is one scene where that actually does happen) you'll be laughing hysterically. Not to mention pointing out to yourself homages to other comic book iterations (the aforementioned rofftop run, Big Daddy's Adam West like cadence when talking in the suit, Kick-Ass in an alley staring up at a wall as if about to scale it like Peter Parker, etc.)

The acting in the movie is phenomenal. Nicholas Cage hasn't been this good in years, and I was personally surprised to find out Aaron Johnson, who plays the title character, is actually a Brit. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Role Models) continues to surprise, considering most actors his age would have been typecast by a role like McLovin, and his arc actually did surprise having seen all of the trailers and promotional material for the movie prior to seeing the movie. The movie, though, is completely stolen by Chloe Moretz ((500) Days of Summer) as the foul mouthed, butt kicking 11-year-old Hit Girl. She plays the role with such force that you genuinely believe that full grown men, mafiosos, would be afraid of this 11-year-old girl.

Naturally, this movie isn't for everyone, as we've seen from the brouhaha that's erupted for a little girl uttering the ""C-word"", but this is one movie I think it's rewarding to see below the surface. There's a certain hint of satire in it's brutality meeted out by a child, and a certain tone in the movie that chastises us for not being more involved in helping those around us, while also showing it's understanding of why we sometimes choose not to. I honestly can say that I can find nothing wrong with this movie, and I'm currently considering adding it to my top 10 all-time favorites list. I highly recommend that you give it a try!

The story is adapted for the screen by director and producer Matthew Vaughn.  The film comes off as a tongue-in-cheek cross between some of the big budget American comic book based films of recent years and live action anime.  The action scenes, just like the film's many colorful characters and its outstanding soundtrack, ask to be taken seriously enough to care for its characters, but in the end are appealing enough as fiction to provoke the audience to laugh, cheer, and generally stay exciting from beginning to end.  The theater I was in gave a hearty applause to Kick-Ass when it ended, and that was deserved.  After all, who doesn't like it when drug-dealers get taken out by likable underdogs that the audience can generally empathize with.

Kick-Ass follows high school age David (Aaron Johnson), an every-teenager who wonders why real-life superheroes don't exist.  This reminds me of a fantastic special on the Science Channel about how Batman could be real, but his life expectancy would be incredibly short, so there's David's answer I suppose.  Anyway, so David settles on becoming a superhero without powers; just a green wetsuit, some batons, a taser, and later some much more heavy duty weapons that would make the US armed forces envious.  Obviously this is a film that asks for some suspension of disbelief but to say David's evolution into superherodome is a hard road is an understatement.  He does meet some very interesting fellow superhero's along the way including Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his little eleven year old girl Mindy, or Hit Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz).  Hit Girl brings the film's overall appeal to a whole other level and there is no doubt she will be a cult icon in years to come.  She curses at her opponents and then flips and dances around with her weapons in kind of a ballet of vengeance.  Legs are amputated, throats are slashed, and the back of heads are blown out all to the sound of the Dickies version of the Banana Splits Theme Song and Bad Reputation by, who else, the Hit Girls.  Finally, David meets fellow superhero newcomer Red Mist, who is complete with his own vehicle, the Mist Mobile.  Red Mist is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and is of course known most for his role as McLovin in the 2007 comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B000WZEZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>, but if he didn't shake off type-casting as a nerdy Live Action Role Player in the underrated 2008 comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Role-Models/dp/B001OD4S50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Role Models</a>, then he has done so here as Red Mist.  Mark Strong, who made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B001OQCV6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes</a>&nbsp;a far better film as that film's antagonist, plays this film's antagonist Frank D'Amico, and does a fantastic job in taking his role just seriously enough. He's a great villain no matter the genre.

Kick-Ass has perfectly timed humor to hopefully place the violence of the film's action scenes into a different lens for its audience.  It's not easy to defend violence in a movie that is clearly trying not to be taken seriously unless the violence is used as comedy itself, and here that can certainly be argued.  Firstly, in several ways, Kick-Ass is a movie about revenge so the violence has some emotional purpose, however flawed the characters may be for employing it.  Secondly, the violence comes off as a cross between Japanese animation and three stooges slaptick humor.  It is certainly a mix that made me laugh very much.  The humor in the film is also strong in its dialogue and the general actions of its unique characters.  The cast seems to get it and I have no doubt that Mark Millar, who wrote the original comic book, was working very closely with Matthew Vaughn in making this a pure effort with every single detail fully understood.  Everyone working on the film was very likely on the same page.  Highly recommended, especially to those who can really appreciate it, and to those who think it might be kind of a family film because one of its most visible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.",1272326400,6,4506,5.430416068866571
4034051,5,B002ZG9846,"Don't look now, but Kick-Ass is the beginning of a new trend in superhero movies.  Here's why it matters:

Two words: Hit-Girl.  Or maybe that's one word. Whatever.  Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) isn't just an equalizer, she's a cross between Stephanie from LazyTown and Robin from Batman.  Hit-Girl is a descendant of the same violent breed of superhero that has been beating villains up for decades, except that she's an 11-year-old girl.  More importantly, she's a female superhero that isn't overtly sexual.  She's the next step up from the Powerpuff Girls. I realized that true Girl Power had come to superhero movies when Hit-Girl punched a grown man in the face with brass knuckles.

Being a superhero has consequences.  We are reminded that Hit-Girl is basically a sociopath who has never been to school.  Hit-Girl views life as a video game, a point reinforced in first-person perspective through her nightvision goggles as she shoots and stabs her way through piles of thugs. Her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is a cold-blooded killer who will slit his opponents' throats. Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) is so terrified of the mass slaughter the aforementioned ""heroes"" inflict that he vows to quit the superhero gig entirely.  It doesn't stick of course.

It was a graphic novel FIRST. Graphic novels often trail movies, adding more detail that was left out.  Kick-Ass the comic was released before the movie, giving the entire plot away.  It doesn't seem to have harmed the film at all. Graphic novels may now become an official extension of movies as part of their development - storyboards and comic panels have a lot in common after all.

Kick-Ass plays for keeps. Kick-Ass isn't so much realistic as it is gritty.  It dispenses with superhero tropes like superpowers and embraces the difficulties of secret identities, not having any powers, and getting hurt.  Kick-Ass gets so beaten up by an uncaring world that he lands in a hospital.  People die.  A lot.

Part thoughtful meditation on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts. Kick-Ass is awesome, not because of just what it does but because of what it represents.  I patiently await a more PG-oriented version of Hit-Girl that will inspire little girls everywhere to play with superhero action figures.",1272240000,4,2430,5.0705289672544085
4034052,5,B002ZG9846,"The movie lives up to it's name. Kick-Ass is a hilarious tongue-in-cheek parody of super heros and comics. It starts out with the main character (Kick-Ass) narrating. The audience sees a costumed hero leap from a tall building and...splat...lands on a taxi. The kid is a geek whose only super power seems to be that he is virtually invisible to the opposite sex. He gets it in his head that he should try to be a super hero. His disguise? A green wet suit. His first outing is not very successful, having been stabbed and then hit by a car. On the plus side he has metal reinfocements throughout his skeleton and deadened nerve ending. Meanwhile Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are disrupting a drug lord's operations (and humorous Batman jokes are plentiful). When the three meet, Hit-Girl shows that she more than lives up to her name, having been well tarined by her ""Big Daddy."" The movie has a simple, yet effective plot, delivers the action, the gun fights, the topical super hero references, a foul mouthed little girl, a dad who is out for revenge, and a comic nerd who eventually gets the girl of his dreams by the end of the film. It is highly recommended for an afternoon of pure escape and fun. It is a movie you can watch again and again, rooting for the heros, and watching the bad guys get what is coming to them.

What's wrong with all of you adults who love this movie? And what does this movie say about American culture, if the most vulgar and brutal superhero ever to ""grace"" the big screen is an 11-year-old girl? Kick-Ass is about as ""original and fresh"" as a beauty pageant with little girls made to parade around like ""sexy adults"" (such as the 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was, by the way, a victim of real violence).

But I have to say that any movie where the father puts a kevlar vest on his 11 year old daughter and shoots her 3 times in the chest with a glock to get her used to the effect is totally insane.

4034098,2,B002ZG9846,"So in what world is it *not* a monstrous notion for a father to train his 11-year-old daughter to be a mass murderer? In the world of ""Kick-Ass,"" of course.

I don't shy away from violent movies at all, at least as long as the violence carries some sense of satire, irony, justice or is just flat-out entertaining.

But even in the glossiest, most colorful fiction, I just can't get behind the idea of a child, led by a parent, to kill dozens of others in the blood-thirstiest ways available. Especially when those actions are presented as heroic, noble and occasionally bunny-cute. To add insult to countless injuries, the filmmakers' calculated desire to seem audacious and spark controversy is completely transparent.

That isn't the least of the film's problems, but it's a large one among many. The film also has a dull lead character, seriously sloppy cinematography and too many confused ideas about what it's trying to say. Half the time it wants to subvert the superhero mythology, the rest of the time it exemplifies the genre at its worst.

There's also an eager, trying-way-too-hard masochism to the brutality that reminded me of another recent bad movie, ""Wanted."" Which, coincidentally, was also by comic book writer and artist Mark Millar, and which also casually tossed around the notion that if a geek wants to leave behind the life of a loser, he only has to get a gun and start shooting. Bad idea jeans.

p.s. I'm willing to bet people who drop negative votes on this review either didn't read the whole thing, didn't understand it, haven't seen enough movies, are 12 years old or all of the above.",1271721600,9,1617,4.781362007168458
4034099,2,B002ZG9846,"At the start of ""Kick-Ass,"" I couldn't help but feel somewhat excited, as I was introduced to the title character, who, when not dressed as a superhero, I found both engaging and amusing. While his thought process is not something I pretend to understand, the situations he finds himself in as a typical high schooler were somewhat relatable, and they got a chuckle or two out of me. But then we meet eleven-year-old Mindy Macready (Chlo Grace Moretz) and her father (Nicholas Cage); they stand in an empty lot, her wearing a bulletproof vest, him pointing a gun at her, all in an effort to train her as a crime fighter. He fires his gun, and that's when the movie stopped being funny for me. But it isn't until she kills someone that I finally realized how deplorable it was.

A killjoy, am I? You'll forgive if I'm not entertained by the sight of a kid murdering people, or of a kid being beaten within an inch of her life by big, mean men with guns. And I'm even less thrilled with the idea of a father training his child to be a ruthless vigilante, as if he were doing no more than showing her how to ride a bike. Yes, I know it's all done stylistically, that it doesn't represent reality, that the whole thing is supposed to be a satire on society and violence and today's internet culture, and yadda yadda yadda. But there does come a point when enough is enough. If I'm failing to see the genius in ""Kick-Ass,"" that's fine by me, because I truly don't want to understand or even inhabit a world where underage carnage qualifies as something to be laughed at.

But before I go too far with this, let me take a moment to discuss the film's first ten minutes, at which point I still had hope it would work. We meet teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an unremarkable comic book reader who notes that, while just about everyone tries to be like their favorite celebrity, few try to be like a superhero. Of course, no one could ever be Superman, for he possesses extraterrestrial powers that exist only in the imagination - the ability to fly, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, etc. But what about someone like Batman, who has no superpowers? True, he's ultra rich and has access to high tech equipment, but he's still fallible. When Dave is mugged and a bystander fails to intervene, he decides to stop wondering and start acting; he dons a mail order green scuba suit and mask and adopts the alter ego Kick-Ass, New York's newest crime fighter.

His attempts at preventing any kind of crime are disastrous, although he quickly becomes a sensation thanks to websites like YouTube and Myspace. This, I can buy: In Western society, anyone can have a taste of fame, even if that person happens to be incredibly untalented. But that's where the satire stops. In due time, Dave crosses paths with Mindy and her father, who dress in flashy superhero suits have adopted the monikers Hit Girl and Big Daddy; both are so skilled at what they do that they seem like ... I was going to say genuine superheroes, but that isn't quite true since all the good ones have never resorted to shooting, stabbing, or throat slitting. However, their knowledge of martial arts is second to none, and so is their ability to jump across long distances and off tall buildings. In other words, they don't seem like ordinary people trying to be superheroes, so the film's premise is now null and void.

There's also a subplot involving Big Daddy's target: Crime boss Frank D'Amico (Erik Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), somehow ends up as a patsy named Red Mist, created with the sole intent of luring in Kick-Ass and taking him down. All this could have been halfway entertaining if only it weren't so intertwined with the story of Hit Girl, who at one point finds herself running down a hallway in slow motion, singlehandedly blowing away an entire squad of well-armed hitmen in a blaze of bullets and blood. Had this not involved an eleven-year-old, I might have gotten into the scene's choreography, which, I must admit, is quite impressive. Alas, I'm watching a girl who hasn't even entered puberty relentlessly killing people, something I wouldn't even want to try to enjoy.

If this truly is an accurate commentary on today's media-obsessed youth culture, and if we're still at a point when mass audiences find this kind of stuff entertaining, then I'm sorry to say we still have a long, long way to go. Under no circumstances should we be laughing at extreme comic book violence involving children, not at a time when we're saturated with news stories about youth gangs and classroom shootings. ""Kick-Ass"" is a grave miscalculation, not only because of its content, but also because of the belief that it's a harmless, escapist action film. The more I think about the audiences that laughed from beginning to end, the sadder I get. Is it no longer fun to watch kids being ... well, kids?",1271635200,13,4889,4.653935185185185
4034100,1,B002ZG9846,"Kick Ass takes place in a world that appears to operate by the same laws of physics and probability as our own. The lead character asks his friends why no one has ever donned a superhero outfit to fight crime. His friends tell him that it's a crazy idea. The only man they can think of who tried something like that was a schizophrenic who fell to his death trying to fly.

Later on, however, it becomes clear that the movie is taking place within a comic book. A little costumed girl (""Hit Girl"") dodges bullets, takes out drug dealers with throwing knives, and goes toe-to-toe with an adult male. This could only happen in a comic book, or a movie based on one.

At first the movie appears to be set in a reality where superheroes only exist in comic books. But when the Hit Girl character is introduced, it's almost as if the characters get sucked into a parallel universe. The costumed characters start pulling off improbable stunts and the storyline loses all touch with logical reality. This wheels within wheels narrative annoyed me, but it wasn't enough to make me hate the movie.

What made me hate Kick Ass was the Hit Girl character. She cusses, she kills, she ventures into drug dens, all under the watchful eye of her father. This is supposed to be funny. The audience is supposed to laugh at this. Apparently, Hit Girl's gruesome antics are supposed to be a satire of something. If it's satire, it's satire so subtle that no one can explain it.

When you criticize a movie like Kick Ass you're accused of ""missing the point""; somehow, the vulgarity and crassness is the ""point"" of the movie, making it impossible to say anything negative about it. Of course, there's nothing satirical here.

If you like Kick Ass, fine, but don't call it satire. Call it a guilty pleasure, call it mindless entertainment, call it a comic book movie, whatever. It can be all of those things, but it's definitely not satire. No one will watch this movie and think, ""Wow, what a brilliant send-up of...""",1271635200,35,1997,4.582633053221288
4034101,5,B002ZG9846,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I have not seen the DVD or Blu-Ray, as they are not released yet, but I had to review this.

I was talking with some co-workers and they told me they thought it would be like ""Mystery Men"". Though I like that movie too, this movie has more in common with ""the Matrix"" than ""Mystery Men"". I told them that before I saw it, and I was right. This movie is a kind of a kind of a Kill Bill version of Spiderman with more humor added. There is lots of comic relief, and that comedy is essential to the plot and pacing of the movie as a whole, but this is NOT simply a comedy. It IS, however, a boatload of FUN!

It is essentially the meshing of two stories that both have the same premise: ""What would happen if someone actually tried to be a super hero?""

In one story we get the tale of an everyman high school kid who loves comic books. He wants to ""put on a suit and help people"". He's a dreamer that means well, but is generally incompetent. So this part of the story is based on what happens when his fantasy gets smacked in the face by the cold hard fist of reality.

The second story is the tale of a competent and smart man that is horribly wronged and seeks revenge. The catch is he has a very young daughter. Like Lone Wolf and Cub he decides to take her with him on his planned journey to hell, only he is smart enough to give her the tools she will need to survive the trip. This part of the story is simple and pure, and you have seen it many times before. The film makers wisely don't embelish it to much, but we do get some exposition and notworthy scenes. Most of this story is left in subtext.

So, what happens when the two stories collide? AWESOMENESS! This is written and performed so well that the stories simply mesh without clashing. I have never seen anything pull this off so well. There are plenty of gritty semi-realistic action scenes, and a little bit of ridiculousness thrown in for good measure. This movie Satisfies with a capital S. The violence is slightly more graphic than the Matrix, but not as intense as Sin City, 300, or Kill Bill. Yes, profanity is there, but there are not as many F-Bombs being dropped as I have seen reported. It's just that much of the profanity comes from the mouth of an 11 year old girl... (Which by the way should not even be allowed to SEE this movie for another 4-5 years!) You should definitely watch it before you allow any child of yours under 16 see it! COME ON! Be a parent already!

I want to add: I saw the Dark Knight movie and I recognized it was a groundbreaking piece of work, but when I left the theatre afterward I just felt depressed. Where was the fun? It was a good movie, but I did not enjoy it, and have not seen it since. Kick-Ass is both an awesome movie and a GREAT TIME! I left the theatre just thinking how soon could I see it again, and who could I share it with next time.

There is at least one reviewer that panned this film because it was not EXACTLY the same as the graphic novel. I used to be like that too, but now I realize that some things work better on the big screen than in a book. He lists the changes, and from what he states, I think I like the movie better than the book. I never read the graphic novel and I am glad I saw the movie first. From his description, I may have skipped the movie had I read the comic first. He complains and gripes that he hates when movies change comics. This is unwarranted. I have seen an interview with the writers that basically state that the screenplay was written more or less concurrently with the comic, just that Millar was primary in writing the comic while Vaughn was primary in writing the screenplay. They collaborated throughout on both, and a movie was always in mind. So, that comic book ""purist"" needs to get a life! THIS MOVIE ROCKS!

The director needs to do more films, and he, Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage deserve Oscar nods, but it won't happen. Hit Girl is written to steal the show, but it could not have been done so well without Chloe's dead on performance. There is not a bad performance in this film.

4034102,5,B002ZG9846,"Kick Ass is how should I say.... awesome, hilarious, cool, high octane energy, kinetic, B*lls to the wall violent, edgy. Have not seen a movie this outlandish since Wanted (which Mark Millar also wrote the graphic novel) and Shoot 'Em Up, both spectacular.
Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) gives us a movie that is unique in its own right, takes the mythos of comic book heroes and gives it a 360 twist, and creates a memorable movie.
This movie will dazzle you, don't get me wrong it is violent, then again it's based on a graphic novel so it's suppose to be! Vaughn has gathered a great group of actors, veteran and new alike to tell a story of a teenager named Dave (new comer Aaron Johnson) who is tired of just sitting on the sidelines of life, tired of the injustice he sees around him, people being victimized and no one does nothing, so he goes out to create his alter ego, Kick Ass! Johnson plays Dave as a geeky, shy, bored, horny teenager, how we were in high school, what keeps it so real, he plays the uber geek to perfection, when it is so well done by the likes of Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg, Aaron Johnson takes it to another level creating something primo, where we as a viewer root for this guy! And Kick Ass doesn't screw around, he gets right into it--- shall I say the proverbial ""popping that first Vigilante cherry"", early on tries to stop some thugs who are stealing a car and ends up getting his ass handed to him, almost getting killed, much like what would happen in real life... yet this does not deter his quest and his next foray into fighting turns out better and his alter ego Kick Ass becomes famous setting off a chain of events that he could not even fathom would happen. Even when meeting Hit Girl and Big Daddy for the first time who save his butt, he then realizes that they are the real deal, fighting crime, kicking ass and taking names, and that the up close violence for him is just too much and it's not like the movies portray it to be, where he's just a kid, having pipe dreams of doing something extraordinary out of the ordinary. In the end though, doing the right thing even it means your life is the right thing to do.

Special Kudos goes to Mark Strong (plays Frank D'Amico), this actor I am liking more and more ever since seeing him in Body of Lies and RocknRolla, and Sherlock Holmes, watch out for him in the new Robin Hood this summer with Russell Crowe! he plays the bad guy with such humor and yet also grounded as if he could be a real guy in real life, he is a drug king pin using a Lumber Co. as a front for his operations, a wonderful performance in deed, delivers great dead pan humor.
Then there is Hit Girl/ Mindy MacCready (new comer Chloe Moretz), a 11 year old who can wield a knife, gun, grenades, swords with the best, and curses like a sailor, what makes it even that more funny! She is certainly a scene stealer in this movie, great job by this young talented actress. And there is Big Daddy/ Damon MacCready (played by my man Nic Cage, I forgive you Cage for giving us crap like Knowing, Next, Bangkok Dangerous, and Ghost Rider) Nic Cage gives such a nuanced performance, teaching his young daughter the art of shoot, kill, maim, and when he is in costume changing his voice (taking a page out of Adam West when he donned the bat suit), He did a great job with his role, his back story is he has some unfinished business with D'Amico, check out his off kilter, brilliant performance in Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans, awesome movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse (Red Mist/ Chris D'Amico) we all know him as McLovin--- shedding that persona giving us a more complex, more than meets the eye type character who just wants the attention of his father and show he can hang and be tough and wants so desperately to show he can take over his pop's business, and all too eager to help his dad get rid of Kick Ass.

I am happy Vaughn and Co. made a hard R movie, not shying away from the violence, even though it shows young people in peril, no compromises, staying true to its comic book roots and being loyal. And almost lampooning Spiderman, Superman, XMen, Watchmen and yet ultimately honoring said comics. A nice homage to Watchmen which is the blue print for Vigilante Heroes which owes it's roots to the Batman mythology. The director takes what we always wanted to be; who hasn't said in their youth, ""Damn wish I could be Batman, Superman, Wolverine, Iron Man"". Where Vaughn took the tried and true comic books and movies incorporates everything we love but keeps it so real and tangible.

A couple of great scenes stand out for me, one is D'Amico and his goons have captured Big Daddy and Kick Ass, they are being tortured, not a pleasant scene, pretty brutal... but what follows, the action sequence is just utterly mind blowing, a First Person Shooter scene was just so visually eye popping made Doom's FPS look childish!
And the last 25 mins or so, the assault on D'Amico's high rise condo was dead on cool. And the soundtrack was amazing, using a Ennio Morricone type Spaghetti Western Style music was freakin' Frosty! The whole soundtrack just was in sync with the movie.

Kick Ass is a no holds barred movie that leaves you satisfied, where after viewing you just wanna grab a smoke and think about what you just witnessed, I cannot wait for the sequel, and this most definitely will be added to my Blu Ray collection.",1271548800,4,5414,4.432730923694779
4034103,3,B002ZG9846,"I find Kick-Ass a hard movie to judge. It's a superhero satire/parody which manages to poke fun of everything from superhero movies to real life monotony. It's got some fun and (purposely) offensive ideas which can (and did) offend as many people as it entertains. While I thought Kick-Ass started off fun with a great in-your-face attitude it burns itself out pretty quickly. Too much of a good thing maybe?

The story of Kick-Ass more or less follows the comic with some entertaining embellishments. Dave is a high school nerd who decides to throw on a costume and fight crime. After eventually taking down some hoodlums he becomes an internet sensation on Youtube and manages to attract 'real' superhero Big Daddy and his 11-year old daughter Hit Girl. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are trying to take down a local mafioso and Dave ends up getting in over his head. Kick-Ass's story has got some great gags and like most send-ups is played for laughs, though I actually found the situations the characters got into (and the observations of society and internet culture) more funny than any of the actual dialogue or the over-the-top action.

The acting in Kick-Ass is great all around. Aaron Johnson is perfectly relatable as Dave and strikes a sort of anti-Peter Parker vibe. Nicholas Cage is fun and campy as Big Daddy and Chloe Moretz steals every scene as Hit Girl. Mark Strong has proved himself capable at playing a villain and is no less effective as the mafioso in Kick-Ass.

The action scenes in Kick-Ass are very slick and very violent. A lot of people were put off by seeing Hit Girl killing and mutilating bad-guys as well as being physically tortured later in the film. If you are offended by  this then probably best to stay away as most of the last third of the film is filled with these scenes. I personally have seen much more offensive scenes (in much BETTER films) so it didn't really effect my enjoyment.

One thing as a comics fan I loved about Kick-Ass was the use of color. Every character in this film whether in superhero costume or civilian clothes looks like they were pulled straight from a comic book ( I also like the 'comic-panel' subtitles).

While I liked Kick-Ass for the most part I did feel a bit burned out by the end. The movie keeps introducing wackier and more violent action and situations and keeps going on for almost two hours! Maybe I'm being too harsh but when a film is simply being played for yucks without introducing anything new it starts to feel like it's wasting my time. It's like a comedian that tells a sick but funny joke but instead of building on it just tells the same joke over and over again making it raunchier and raunchier.

Obviously I'm in the minority with my luke-warm opinion of Kick-Ass. Like I said, there's a lot of fun to be had with this film but if it's just playing itself for laughs why go on for so long?",1271548800,6,2879,4.567829457364341
4034174,5,B002ZG9846,This is a movie you will probably want to see again and again. Hit Girl is great. The only problem I have with the movie is they let one bad guy get away. It's hard to believe Hit Girl would ever do that. Maybe they want a sequel though. That would good.,1271462400,5,254,3.9038461538461537
4034175,5,B002ZG9846,"I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising moviegoing experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it`ll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.

Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year!

Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero!

Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride!

As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing!

This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it.",1271462400,6,3266,4.538200339558574
4034176,5,B002ZG9846,"""Kick-Ass"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Dave Lizewski, a comic-book fanboy, decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name -- Kick-Ass -- assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There's only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, is hunted by assorted violent and unpleasant characters, and meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy.

The cast led by Aaron Johnson (as Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as Chris D'Amico / Red Mist), Mark Strong (as Frank D'Amico), and in standout performances, Chloe Moretz (as Mindy Macready / Hit Girl) & Nicolas Cage (as Damon Macready / Big Daddy) is great!

The screenplay (based on the comic book by Mark Millar & John Romita Jr., both also executive produced) by Vaughn & Jane Goldman (also co-produced) (who also did the screenplay to ""Stardust"") is great!

This is a excellent action movie packed with comedy, action, and drama. This is a fun and witty ride. Nicolas Cage & Chloe Moretz both stand out in this film.",1271462400,4,4169,5.083211678832117
4034177,4,B002ZG9846,"What a wacky movie this is. When I first saw the previews, I thought this Kick-Ass was going to be aimed at kids and teens. Boy was I way off, because it earns it's R rating many times over. I really had no intention of seeing this film until I saw the very positive reviews flowing in from the critics. Not that I always agree with them, but in this case I would like to thank them for getting my butt down to the local theater today.

Parts of the movie reminded me of Watchmen. You have everyday people who are sick of bad things happening to good people, decide to put on costumes, have funny hero names, and then beat and cut apart the bad guys in a not so nice way. I actually thought it was rather tame in the gore department, compared to what I read about beforehand, but the violence and language is way too strong for kids.

The acting is good from everyone. I liked newcomer Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass himself. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performaces in a long time, though I think he was great in an over-the-top kind of way in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is still doing his McLovin thing in every movie since Superbad, but it worked again. Mark Strong is kind of one note as the villain, like in Sherlock Holmes, but I think he's a little better in this role. The real star of the show is little 11-year-old, Chloe Moretz, as Hit-Girl. She is clearly the most memorable thing in a movie with a bunch of stuff worth remembering. As the daughter of Cage's Big Daddy hero, she spews out bad language, slices and shoots baddies by the dozens, and loves her daddy. I want one of my own.

Kick-Ass is serious in tone most of the time, but there are some killer comedy bits and lines that had the whole theater erupting with laughter. The music is well placed in key scenes and the director/writer, Matthew Vaughn, did a fine job in creating a comic book film that should please both fans and non-fans of the genre alike.

Even though it looks like Kick-Ass will come in #1 this weekend, it still feels more like a cult film to me. I can easily see this movie being talked about decades from now, much like Army of Darkness, but without the campiness factor. What a breath of fresh air in a genre that has just as many misses as it does hits.",1271462400,256,2304,4.289655172413793
4034178,5,B002ZG9846,"The film is based on a comic book by the same name. The rights to the story were sold before the book was even published (it debuted only eight weeks before the film):

A teenage boy decides to take a stand for justice. He dons a green scuba costume and names himself Kick-Ass. However, not having any actual superpowers, this hero's good intentions quickly land him in an ICU. Eventually though, Kick-Ass crosses paths with a couple of far more effective (a.k.a. deadly) heroes: Big Daddy, a former cop falsely convicted of drug trafficking, and Hit-Girl, his eleven year old daughter. Big Daddy has spent the past six years training his little girl in all forms of mortal combat, hoping she would help him revenge her mother's death and her father's fall from grace, orchestrated by a local Mafia Boss.  Enter blood, gore, and plenty of belly laughs...

Let me get straight to the point: yes, the film was funny and highly entertaining. However, initially I felt uneasy laughing at an eleven year old girl determinedly slaughtering a roomful of men, even if they were rotten to the core and disserving of every bullet and of every knife wound. But then, I remembered what I was like at that age: it was the early 80's. My favourite toys were a silver colt revolver and a sword. Depending on my mood, I would pretend to be a cowboy taking on a bunch of wild Indians, or a Jedi disarming (literally) Darth Vader and his evil cohorts. So, if any of you want to believe that little girls' minds are all about sugar and spice, well... good luck with that (by the way, I managed to grow into adulthood WITHOUT slipping into drugs and/or alcohol, and no, I was not a teenage mother). And so, that quick recollection gave me the permission to look at the film as an absurd exercise in fantasy and allowed me to enjoy every minute of it. Yes, the film was well written, directed and edited, but the special mention must go to the actress who portrayed Hit-Girl. Chloe Moretz was indeed eleven at the time of filming, but had the presence of a seasoned performer. I am looking forward to watching her future projects.  There is already talk of a sequel. I'd pay to see it!

Laugh and enjoy!",1271376000,123,2182,4.541984732824427
4034179,4,B002ZG9846,"If you initially thought (thanks to the trailers having to be approved for all audiences) that Kick-ass would be a potential Razzie-award winning spoof on the same level as Disaster Movie, Dance Flick, Meet the Spartans, and just about every *insert type of movie here* movie that is released nowdays (one word for those cinematic _____mongers: UGH), don't feel bad if you did.  I did too.  When I first saw the trailer for Kick-ass, my mind went along the lines of ""why does the movie industry keep making these spoof movies!"".  I really did think the movie would be another lame spoof movie or a half-@$$ed superhero comedy for children.

Instead, what I got was a endlessly entertaining (the movie took no time to ramp up), violent, foul-mouthed comic joyride, both making fun of comic books and at the same time being a serious superhero movie (albeit with a zany Red Bull bend). I admit that it took me the R-Rating and an uncensored preview when realizing what it really was: A violent, often hilarious, and almost Tarantino-ish superhero flick, both serious, funny, and gloriously over the-top.  So much for first impressions.  It's much more than that, and It's certainly the movie I've been waiting for this year, considering how dire the year of 2010 has been for films (the new Scorsese movie was a two and a half hour rejected Twilight Zone episode, at best).

A comparison that is already swirling around is a mixture of Spider-man and Kill Bill, and as my namesake probably suggests, it appeared to my Tarantino senses and delivered some thrilling action sequences.  The action is stylized in a way that would make the man himself very proud.  Most funny are the riffs on comic books, such as Dave's first attack that surely shows him why many people don't don costumes in the first place.  However, if you are a fan of superhero films, comic books, and take them seriously, don't worry, Kick-Ass doesn't spit on your past time, either.  Despite some of the satirical jokes regarding comic books in general, Kick-Ass is still a genuine superhero film at heart.  Kick-ass doesn't turn into a cynical satire with a ""Superheroes are totally fake and your an idiot for getting into them"" message.  The superheros are also internally motivated (Big Daddy and Hitgirl are both victims of murder), which helps the film seem more like a real superhero film, than just a satire on the world of comics.

I'm sure Kick-Ass might get some criticism as being a movie that has nothing to offer besides shock-value.  As far as shock value goes, I wouldn't quite go for that, especially if you've seen such movies as Cannibal Holocaust, but this movie doesn't need shock value (ask Tom Green).  You'll laugh when it's funny, and be energized by the violence of the movie, not shocked by it.  That's the reason why it's great, it's more than just shock value, it's pure fun, like the rollercoaster type of feeling.  When we ride rollercoasters, we don't think of the negative emotions and how tough we will look, we think of how much pure fun were having.  That's how the R worthy content in this movie should be approached.

Some of the humor falls flat, as I found some (SOME, people) of the raunchy humor to be kind of hackneyed, such as the scene in the beginning regarding self-stimulation.  It wasn't like Superbad, where most of the raunchy jokes were laugh out loud hilarious and quite creative, at least in my opinion.  They were thought out, not their for some cheap laughs.  Thankfully, these kind of jokes are kept to a minimum with great use of timing and swearing in the dialogue.  As you probably have heard by now, the 11 year old (at the time) Chloe Moertz steals the show here, as the violent 11 year old teenage girl with the mouth of a sailor and the maturity of a person much older than her age.  Another funny performance, well performances, I found were the mobsters, as their foul-mouthed, deliberately crude dialogue got a lot of laughs from me.  Lot's of the situations are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.

I for one am not a great fan of Superhero movies (some people really love them and get into the backstories and characters much more than I do.  They really do treat them like Greek Mythology), but I do enjoy them and I must say that Kick-Ass is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen, much more than movies like X-men or Superman Returns (though I list those for personal preferences, I have nothing wrong with those movies).  You'll get your money worth, and you'll have a Kick-ass time (sorry).  This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday, and like most cult movies, it will hit home for the right kind of viewer.  Either way, don't miss Kick-Ass.",1271376000,9,4776,4.663484486873508

4034181,1,B002ZG9846,"I'm convinced there's a class of artist who'd crap on the Mona Lisa, and then have the nerve to show it to you convinced that they're an artistic genius and have much improved on the original. What's sad is there are those who'd agree with them.  Who'd go ""Oh you're such a brilliant artist, how do you do it?""  Unfortunately the artwork in question hasn't changed; it just has a bunch of crap on it now.
 This sort of thing has happened in any number of movies based on original works. ""The Black Cauldron"" by Lloyd Alexander, ""The Mist"" by Steven King, to name just a couple, and I really wonder what they were thinking when they took these brilliant original works and created drivel I'd rather rip my eyeballs out then watch. What do best selling authors know about plot development anyway? Obviously nothing. What's saddest is I'm sure the directors are still congratulating themselves on how brilliant they are.
 Well the same thing has happened with Kick Ass the movie. The first quarter was ok, it stuck to the original with a few minor changes, like deleting the important torture scene and the scene when three teenage girls threaten to cut his penis off because they think he's a pervert in his costume, that I'd have liked to see.
  After that it goes to hell. In the graphic novel the crime boss instantly realizes that poor wimpy Kick Ass isn't the one killing his men. In the movie contrary to all evidence he's convinced that Kick Ass is killing his men. This sends everything down a strange path and the surprise identity of Red Mist not only isn't a surprise but is done to death for no reason I can see because he wasn't an interesting character. It gets worse. In the graphic novel the beautiful girl he has a crush on has her boyfriend beat him up when she finds out he's not gay. In the movie they end up having lots of sex. You tell me what's more likely to happen to a comic book geek in high school?  Sure.
  The ending was annihilated. The surprise revelation of Big Daddy's true identity was cut out completely. The inevitable fight scenes were hopelessly contrived. Hello Hit Girl your fathers on fire you should put him out now.  I have no idea what that was about. Hit Girl was the only high point in this horrible movie. She was quite adorable as an eleven year old killer.  You might want to see the movie just to see her in action, but for gods sakes don't waste any money on it.
  I'm convinced that if they'd been faithful to the original graphic novel this could have been as good as Sin City, as it is it's a joke filled with pointless action stupid dialogue and a senseless plot, and I'm sure the director responsible is congratulating himself on what a great job he did.",1271376000,22,2709,4.448484848484848
4034182,5,B002ZG9846,"What a great time at the movie!  This has it all, it's funny, has great lines, decent plot and fantastic characters.

The Plot is that an average high school wonders why nobody stands up for anyone being hurt or abused.  He doesn't have any super powers, and feels that it's not really needed to fight crime, and he's right.  As it turns out there are to others who feel the same way he does: Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  Also Red Mist.  I don't want to say why or how they join forces because I don't want to spoil anything.

The characters are fantastic. I liked how we get into Kick Asses mind at one point he feels he should give up his alter ego, because it's a waste of time, and it's not fun any more.  Kick Ass was a decent character to have, but he wasn't the only one.

Big Daddy, was a very interesting character. When you see Big Daddy, pay attention to his speech pattern. It's exactly like Adam West Did for Batman. That was such a nice touch. I also like the how Cage played his character, and then how he changed that character for Big Daddy.  It was a very nice job.

Hit Girl, my favorite!!  She stole the movie and did it with a smile on her face.  By far, she was the best. She had the best lines, and the best actions scenes. When I say she can clean house, trust me on it.  This was a fantastic character.  She had the most violent scenes, and had a potty mouth, but for me, that's what added to the humor of it.  Hit Girl was fantastic, and I hope she has her own movie!  Hit Girl rocks!

Overall, I really liked the movie and had a fun time with it.  It held my attention for the 2 hours, and didn't check my watch once.  It has a lot of action, great music/songs in it and some of the best editing I've seen in a while. It was also wonderfully written and acted.  This is what a movie should be. Now, this was a violent one. Don't be fooled into thinking it's for kids, cuz it's not. Lot of violence and some pretty naughty language, and I mean naaaaaaughty.

This is a fantastic popcorn movie. If you go, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I did.  I can't wait for it to come to Blu-Ray!

4034183,5,B002ZG9846,"Somewhere, Mark Millar won't be rolling over in his grave. That's because 1) he's not dead, and 2) his comic book KICK-ASS gets the jawdropping cinematic treatment. I lost my mind a couple of times while watching this film, and I plan on catching this sucker again ASAP. With a movie title like it's got, it must've been problematic trying to promote and advertise this motion picture. But it's so wildly entertaining that I've no doubt word-of-mouth buzz alone will propel it to box office supremacy. It's the definition of a water cooler movie.

Step up. Take a stand. Make a difference. Be a person of conviction. Put on a costume. Kick asss. I don't want to spill too many things, and this film has so many terrific moments, especially if you're a die-hard comic book guy like me, and it'd be too easy to drop a spoiler. The story has things to say about how comic books impact our culture, how today's near instantaneous forms of communication give us instant gratification and a wider scope of influence. Our central character, Dave, his legend spreads like a virus.

Teenager Dave Lizewski says that later on in the film, but before that, at the start of the film, he and his loser pals are hanging out in a comic book shop and Dave wonders aloud why no one has ever tried to become a superhero in real life. Not too much later, he dons a colorful snorkeling suit (purchased on E-bay) and begins patrolling the city at night. Dave Lizewski has no special skills whatsoever. The first time he engages in a fight, he doesn't do too well, and this is probably more true to life than anything else that could've happened. And I guess Dave's super powers are good intentions and a certain undauntedness because he keeps on keeping on. His next skirmish, he becomes an overnight YouTube sensation.

The first real-life ""superhero,"" Dave inspires other costumed vigilantes, and it's around this point, when we're introduced to Damon and Mindy Macready, that we know we're seeing something off, something audacious and subversive and just friggin' cool. The Macreadys form a father-daughter crimefighting team called Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and, unlike Dave, this pair is the real deal; they're the scourge of New York's criminal underworld. Nicolas Cage breaks his streak of stupendously horrid performances to deliver a fair bit of acting. Big Daddy has got issues. He's obsessed with taking down a New York crime lord (Mark Strong), and yet he also loves his adorable eleven-year-old daughter whom, by the way, he's trained to be an unstoppable killing machine from an early age. For her birthday, he gives her twin butterfly knives. That is some crazy, disturbed fatherly love. If nothing else, Cage as Big Daddy also occasionally launches into a pretty nifty homage to Adam West.

Not that the film stays strictly faithful to its source. Little things were altered here and there, and two big plot elements were significantly altered, one referring to Dave's personal high school life, the other is in regards to a relevant side character. I can't say much more than that, other than I can sort of see why those changes were made for the film.

Here, eat some adjectives: Irreverent, satiric, hilarious, profane, dysfunctional, and uber-violent, although not as violent or gory as Millar's comic book. This film is family friendly in the same way that Big Daddy demonstrates admirable parenting skills. The screenplay is sharp; the soundtrack fits the moments. The movie simultaneously lampoons and wallows in its comic book roots, and the opening scene sets the tone. The cast is great; the other actors do exceedingly well (British guy Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski just right), but let's not fcuk around here, young Chloe Moretz steals this movie, and hers is the breakout character by far. Hit-Girl, eleven years old and gleefully ending people's lives with this big grin on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema. Sue me for being inappropriate, but all those just-mentioned qualities add up to one big ball of awesome. Hit-Girl is bananas.

By the way, John Romita, Jr. also won't be rolling over in his grave, for the same reasons cited above.

The DVD's bonus features include: a pretty dry but informative audio commentary by director Matthew Vaughn, ""It's On! The Comic Book Origin of KICK-ASS"" - a documentary nicely exploring KICK-ASS's comic book roots and including interviews with co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita, and Jr, inker Tom Palmer and colorist Dean White - and we also get to see the art process as it goes from pencils to inks to colors (00:20:34 minutes); the Art of KICK-ASS - still segments dedicated to Storyboards, Costumes, On-Set Photography, Production Design, and John Romita, Jr's Art for the film; and the marketing archive (comprised of the theatrical trailer, the profanity-laced Redband Hit Girl trailer, and promotional movie posters and images produced for the North American and International campaigns).",1271376000,13,5108,4.9533255542590435

Resolution is so so, but the biggest issue is motion artifacts, mostly terrible jutter in any vertical or horizontal panning. Very distracting.",1528070400,,311,4.571428571428571

8384910,5,B002ZG9846,"Part action movie, part comedy, Kick-Ass is a riff on the super-hero genre that pokes fun and pays tribute to them at the same time.  Sixteen year old Dave Lizewski can't understand why no one has ever tried to be a super-hero.  Having no powers, but lot of enthusiasm, Dave sets out on his adventure.  Along the way he meets Big Daddy, who sounds a lot like Adam Wests Batman, and Hit-Girl who sounds a lot like sailors I know.
This movie is like  roller-coaster.  One minute hilarious, the next serious.  I have to say this is one of my favorite movies.  Great soundtrack and score, an engaging story and plenty of action.",1524441600,,624,4.469026548672566
