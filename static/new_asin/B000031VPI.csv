7916467,3,B000031VPI,"I like Marseillian story and South of France ambiance.
I didn't like morality and how the movie ends
Some points of view, mainly explained are really critical.",1358553600,,159,4.925925925925926
7916468,5,B000031VPI,"Robert Guediguian has outdone himself this time. After the soothing, mild success of his first short film, ""Votre grenouille a mang mon dejeuner.""  Robert has come roaring back like some type of movie making lion. The title, the colors, the props, the wardrobe, all of it: GOLD!  Of particular imports are his Chapter Headings including such tear jerkers as: 'Tu as grossi' and the politically charged 'Voulez-vous cesser de me cracher dessus pendant que vous parlez!' Robert has clearly entered a new stage in his career. Here's hoping it's the bonus stage.",1138147200,,558,5.054347826086956
7916469,5,B000031VPI,"Ariane Ascaride, the star of this film, is a little whippet of  a woman  and no beauty, but she carries the film triumphantly. and  she does it by sheer force of personality, her lovely smile. and delightful facial expressions. Her husband, Robert Guediguian, the director and writer of this film, has  again made  a warm, inspiring romantic comedy about people at the lower end of the social scale. This is something Hollywood seems rarely able to do; all the people in their romantic comedies must usually be rich, frequent expensive restaurants, have large cars and live in expensively furnished spacious apartments. But who wants money when, as this film demonstrates, you can be so happy without it?
Three ordinary women,  none of them glamourous, all of them attractive, live  cheek by jowl in a sort of tenement courtyard with two male friends. It's nice to see them all sitting around together in the warm evenings, surrounded  by flowers  and pot-plants, chatting, confiding in each other as friends do, and sharing a joke.
Jeanette lives with her young son and teenage daughter from two  husbands - one left  her and the other was killed - and she has not had sex or a  man in her life for eight long years. Marius is  a  security guard on  a demolition site and finds Jeanette about to steal two  large  cans of paint with which to  decorate her house. He gives her a hard time;  but she gives as good as she gets, calls him a fascist and they part as enemies. Later that day, however, a knock  comes at her door and she finds him standing their with her two cans of paint. This friendly gesture is enough to stimulate in her romantic fantasies and as she watches him limp away down the alley we are shown her vision of herself running towards him on the beach to be lovingly clasped in his arms. Her face in close-up as leaning against the door post she has this vision is beatific. How could you not love such as woman?
He meets her next standing on the  edge of a high building, but she quickly explains that this is the spot she used to stand in when at the age of nine she came to visit her father who was crushed to death at the age of 37. He then challenges her to a race with the proviso that if he wins she must allow him to decorate her house. His limp suddenly disappears and he wins easily.
The ending too is excellent, though it is sad to be told by the voice over that they all end up in the local cemetery. That was not something  I  wanted to be reminded of even if it does give a certain poignancy to the  film's ending",1039219200,,2547,4.3588110403397025
7916470,5,B000031VPI,"This is a funny, heartwarming, quirky and sometimes hilarious film about two French blue collar and communist workers falling in love in a lower middle class section of Marseilles.  The movie is a character study of some  truly eccentric characters.  There isn't much action, but there is constant  humor and marvelling at such a fine script.  You might say that it is Barry  Levinson directing a film in France instead of Baltimore.",947376000,,433,4.944444444444445
