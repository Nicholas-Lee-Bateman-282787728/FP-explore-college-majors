The back of the disc is also blue which basically means this guy has copied this print and the picture quality is soo poor that I can't describe it, too blury volume gets loud then low nearly every scene. Plz do not buy from this guy he is a fraud can't believe I have been scammed!!!",1394150400,,363,3.918918918918919
