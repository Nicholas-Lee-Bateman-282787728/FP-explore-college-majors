Mann, Cyril Delevanti, Teresa Graves, Rosemary Forsyth among others plus some good old fashioned fisticuffs. A nice transfer from Warners with solid colors.

8481931,3,B005OT7XFW,"Not a bad time filler. No racial stereotypes. A low key Private Eye movie from the 70's good performances, script and overall good production values. I found this movie entertaining and it had fairly good mystery case.
If you liked Robert Mitchum's turn as Phillip Marlow in the 70's then you're bound to like Black Eye.",1399680000,4,320,4.732142857142857
