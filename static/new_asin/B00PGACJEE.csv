8687774,5,B00PGACJEE,"I have been a digital artist for a decade and wanted to find new expressive techniques for my artwork, this DVD-ROM did not disappoint.  Scott Deardorff really takes his time to break down the nuance of using the tools in Photoshop to get a beautiful result in your work, he adds tool tips and techniques that are simplistic and without making layer runs over 3 usually.  The DVD-ROM is quite long so it is best to follow 1 chapter at a time before moving through to the next.  It is HIGHLY recommended to follow each chapter as it is listed; each chapter is the foundation for the following one.",1453939200,,596,4.4495412844036695
