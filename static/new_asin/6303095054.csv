7837395,5,6303095054,"In ""Sonic's Song"", Katty Karlise writes a song about Sonic (and I assure you the theme to the SatAM version is better). Robotnik, being a music-hater, creates the Music Destroyer robot, which captures Katty. Sonic and Tails head for Robotropolis to destroy the MD and rescue Katty. Meanwhile, Robotnik wants to write his own song (that gets my vote for ""Most Annoying Song of 1993"").
Then in ""Best Hedgehog"", Uncle Chuck (I can make part of this review up!) informs Sonic and Tails to rescue Lucas, a prisinor Robotnik locked up after sending King Acorn to the Zone of Scilence. When Lucas is rescued and brought to Knothole, Sonic must reunite Lucas with his girlfriend, Lucinda (but Robuttnik thinks Lucinda was in love with him!).  END",899164800,2,738,4.857142857142857
