1966571,5,B000127LW2,"Just Kidding. No, really, I'm writing a review for Star Trek: Voyager (ST-V). I had never been interested in Sci-Fi untill my bro-inlaw introduced me to Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was cool and all, but I have never had a TV Show hit me harder than ST-V. It has it all: suspence, drama, sexuality (BIG PLUS, especialy 7 o' 9), special effects, action, things that blow up, and suprises that will blow you away. I highly recomend ST-V, But it doesn't really get that good untill season 4. Then again, thats when 7 o' 9 came on the show (5 stars on her, too).",1069891200,,564,4.330188679245283
1966572,5,B000127LW2,"Note:  This is more of a commentary on the show than on the upcoming DVD.  But I hope it will help you in your decision to purchase Season One of Star Trek Voyager.
As of this date, I have only seen the packaging for the Voyager DVDs.  I'm not sure how the material is being presented.  But rest assured, Star Trek: Voyager's debut on DVD has been a long time in coming.  Many Trek fans have criticized Voyager for being aimless, the stories lifeless, the cast unlikable, too much Borg here, too little of this there.  The fact is, not everyone is going to enjoy what Voyager was offering.  Not everyone enjoyed Deep Space Nine (although it's a brilliant series), and not everyone is currently appreciating Enterprise for what it is.  As for myself, I happen to disagree with all of the negative criticisms.  In my opinion, I believe Voyager to be one of the strongest series, next to Deep Space Nine, in the entire Trek canon.  Every show has weak stories - not every show has a cast with an incredible chemistry.  Not every show has a story arch that persists for 7 solid years.  Not every show puts a woman in a commanding, leading role and manages to succeed as a character/captain, where others have faltered.  Voyager does all of this, and more.  It takes Roddenberry's vision of exploration and makes it the central focus.  In essence, this is Lost in Space, with a Starfleet crew.
For 7 exhilarating seasons, we join two crews (Starfleet and Maquis) who are unnervingly forced to work together as one, as they truly go where no one has gone before.  Thrown 70 thousand light years across the galaxy into the Delta quadrant, it's up to the intrepid crew of the highly advanced, intrepid-class starship Voyager to work together and confront a slew of new alien races, civilizations, and intricate conflicts in order to safely return home.  It's not always smooth sailing, and if you think you know how they make it back to Earth, think twice.  The number of riveting, edge-of-your-seat two-parters are plentiful and serve as captivating examples of how *great* Trek stories should be told.  It's truly a story of change.  The characters grow and develop into people you'll swear you know inside and out, and by the end of the show, you'll feel as if you made a `trek' across the Delta quadrant yourself.
The spectrum of Star Trek: Voyager is both broad and brilliant.  It has an epic quality that builds and builds each season.  I've grown to love every crew in each Trek series, but Voyager's crew is one that will hold a special place in my heart, always.
I suspect Paramount will do just as good, if not a better job on these than the Deep Space Nine discs.  If they come anywhere close, fans of the series should not be disappointed.
Everyone, get ready for the journey - all over again.  If you missed the show the first time around, you're in for an awesome treat!",1069718400,15,2876,4.583170254403131
1966573,5,B000127LW2,"I have waited in anticipation for this moment. I am sure that is true of many fellow trekkers. I have enjoyed the lot on VHS and come Feb we [trekkers and all others who'd enjoyed or would enjoy this saga] could all partake in the eventful, bittersweet and heartfelt journey of Voyager in its most basic of quest... the quest to come home...",1069718400,,341,4.428571428571429
1966574,4,B000127LW2,"Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001.  Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season.  The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.
Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Even while travelling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth.  Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing.  Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.
The primary cast members of the first season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  In the two-part series opener entitled ""The Caretaker"", Chakotay, B'Elanna, Seska (Martha Packett) and a few other occasional Voyager crewmen were not part of the original Voyager crew.  Instead, they were members of the Maquis, a group of armed separatists opposed to both Federation and Cardassian rule.  They, along with the crew of Voyager (who is sent to capture them), are themselves captured by a very advanced being known only as the Caretaker, who uses his technology to grab and transport them to the Delta Quadrant.  The transportation damages Voyager and the Maquis ship and leaves many Voyager crewmen dead.  Rather than let a less advanced, but violent, race known as the Kazon obtain the ailing Caretaker's technology, Captain Janeway makes the unpopular decision to destroy the Caretaker's ship, which also destroys their best & easiest chance of getting home quickly.  Hence, Voyager is on its own in the Delta Quadrant, having no support from the Federation, and begins its long journey back home with a combined Federation/Maquis/Delta Quadrant-native crew.
Through the first season, Voyager continues to battle the Kazon (who are determined to own its technology), the unfriendly holographic Doctor (the only doctor on board) starts to become more sentient and friendly thanks to his interactions with Kes, a traitor is on the loose, the phage-infected Vidians want to harvest Voyager crewman organs, the crew experiences time travel, the crew have to acquire a taste for Neelix's cooking, and B'Elanna experiences inner battle between her human and Klingon halves.  Noteworthy episodes include the two-part ""The Caretaker"", ""Time and Again"", ""Phage"", ""The Cloud"", ""Eye of the Needle"", ""Emanations"", ""Faces"", ""Jetrel"" and ""Learning Curve"".
Overall, I rate the first season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a good start for what ultimately became a much better series after the introduction of the former Borg character ""Seven of Nine"" (Jeri Ryan) at the end of the third season.  I am very glad to see Paramount Television finally begin releasing the ""Voyager"" series on DVD.",1069632000,4,4355,5.283646888567294
1966575,4,B000127LW2,"Finally Voyager comes home on DVD. Priced just like the previous DS9 sets, we can expect these season sets to come out every other month for the year of 2004.
Star Trek Voyager. What can I say really? I was there at the beginning, and watched the entire series, minus a few eps. It's the story of a starship lost in the Delta quadrant, trying to form new alliances, and avoid the Borg, on their way home. Yes, it had it's ups and downs. Yes they brought in a hot chick to play a borg by mid-series. Many will claim Voyager is horrible, when the simple fact is it's not. It's actually pretty good. It's just a little different from the Treks we're used to. Great characters for me were Tuvok the vulcan, and the Holo-doctor. I really don't know what else to say, except Borg Queen, Species 8472, Viddians. :)
The bonus material on this first set is meaty to say the least. There's all kinds of behind the scenes stuff, plus the long awaited and often wished for, never aired Bujold as Janeway footage. This alone should be worth the money for the first set.",1069632000,5,1056,4.365482233502538
1966576,5,B000127LW2,"Voyager is the only Star Trek series from which I have not missed one single episode when it was aired.
At last, now it is coming to DVD. I can't wait until February 24th. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the extra features.
If you are a Trekkie, you must own it. I plan to order all 7 seasons as soon as they become available.",1069632000,2,335,4.090909090909091
1966577,4,B000127LW2,"This set of DVDs includes all 15 episodes from the first season, exclusive featurettes and bonus material. The episodes are in full screen format (widescreen would have been nice - hence 4 stars. Of course, since it wasn't originally created in widescreen format, this full-screen format is understandable) with newly remixed Dolby Digital English 5.1 tracks and English Dolby Surround.  The episodes from season one are:
Disc 1:
Caretaker - The series premier. While Voyager is in pursuit of a Maquis ship, both vessels disappear into an area known as the badlands where an unknown phenomenon sends both ships into the Delta quadrant.  There they suddenly appear on what appears to be a farm but is really a laboratory in orbit around a planet. Two crewmembers are missing and Captain Janeway follows a signal from the laboratory to a planet where they find the missing crewmembers.  But how did they get there and why were they there?
Parallax - Voyager encounters and area of space with heavy spatial distortions where they come across a ship that is trapped in the event horizon of a collapsed star.  Voyager unsuccessfully tries to rescue the ship but can't by itself and speeds off to try to find help.  But as they head away from the star they realise they're heading right back to it! They must come up with a plan to escape from this anomoly.
Time and Again - While investigating the source of a disasterous shockwave encountered by Voyager, memers of the crew are transported back in time to the day before the shockwave was created.  Trying to get back to their ship before the disaster occurs, they encounter a group of protesters outside a government polaric ion power station who plan on destroying the facility. One of the worst Voyager characters, Kes, plays an important role in this mission with her ""latent Ocampan psychic abilities.""
Disc 2:
Phage - During an away mission, the other weak character from Voyager (but still better than Kes), Neelix is attacked and apparently killed.  When found by his crewmates it was discovered that his lungs had been removed. The Doctor is able to implant holographic lungs that keep him alive but confined to sick bay.  Another away mission is sent to find out what happened and they discover a medical lab full of organs from different species.  Just then Voyager detects an alien vessel leaving orbit and Voyager takes off in pursuit.
The Cloud - Voyager explores a nebula rich in omicron particles, which might prove useful for the ship's energy reserves. But when Voyager enters the nebula, it encounters an energy barrier that brings the ship to a dead stop. Breaking through, the ship continues its penetration of the nebula and are attacked by organisims that attach themselves to the hull and begin draining energy from Voyager...
Eye of the Needle - Voyager encounters a wormhole that might take them back to the alpha quadrant but it's too small for the entire ship to enter so a probe is sent through.  The probe gets stuck in a gravitational anomoly before making it through but is being scanned by someone on the other side of the wormhole.  Janeway orders a message be sent via the probe and the receive a reply from the aplha quadrant...
Ex Post Facto - While on an away mission assiting a scientist repair some equiment on the Banean homeworld, Paris was convicted of the murder of the scientist and his punishment is to relive the crime from his victim's perspective every 14 hours.  Janeway sets out to discover what happened.
Disc 3:
Emanations - Chakotay, Kim and Torres beam down to a cavern in an asteroid and discover what appears to be an alien burial ground.  While taking sensor readings, a ""dimensional distortion"" forms and beings to fill the cavern. The away teams beams back to Voyager but Kim isn't transported back - in his place is the body of a deceased alien.
Prime Factors - The crew takes some R&R on a planet full of hospitality.  There they discover the inhabitants have a device that can fold space, allowing travel to places even as remote as 40,000 light years away.  This could be the crew's chance to get back to Earth.  But will the Prime Directive prevent obtaining it?
State of Flux - While searching for food on a planet, a Kazon ship is detected in orbit.  After a brief conflict between away teams the Voyager crew makes it back safely and breaks orbit.  A few days later a Kazon distress signal is received and Janeway feels obligated to respond.  It turns out to be the same Kazon ship encountered in orbit at the planet they just visted and there is only one surviving member of the Kazon crew. The weapon signatures indicate Federation technology was used in the destruction, but how?  While investigating the cause of the destruction, another Kazon vessel arrives in response to the distress signal...
Heroes and Demons - Ensign Kim in trapped in a holodeck simulation of Beowulf during a freak accident involving beaming samples of a protostar onto Voyager.  Tuvok and Chakotay ""disappear"" when sent in to try and bring Kim out and the captain won't risk any more humans so she sends the Doctor in to save the missing crew memembers.
Disc 4:
Cathexis - Tuvok and Chakotay are attacked in a shuttlecraft by an unknown entity that drains the bio-neural energy from the Chakotay's brain.  Upon recovering on Voyager, members of the crew being to act strangely - Paris alters the ship's course without knowing or remembering had had done so and Torres initiates a warp core shutdown without knowing it.  Examinations by the Doctor reveal alien entity had seized control of their minds to force them to do these things.  Janeway transfers all command and control functions to the only non-organic crew member, the Doctor, as a precaution while they investigate what's happening.
Faces - When members of an away team disappear on a planet, another away team is sent to investigate.  They locate the other team in a cave but can't penitrate a force field protecting the cave.  One member of the missing away team is Torres and it becomes obvious that she's part of an experiment when suddenly there is an all-Klingon Torres and an all-human Torres.
Jetrel - Neelix is surprised when a Haakonian scientist responsible for the conquest of Neelix's homeworld suddenly wants to meet with Neelix.  Apparently, this scientist and Neelix were both exposed to high levels of metreon isotopes which endanger the lives of all members of both species.  The Haakonian has only days to live and wants to take blood samples from Neelix and use Voyager's technology to work on a cure for both races.  But is this is true intent?
Learning Curve - When a member of the crew from the original Maquis crew disrupts the ship's power by making an unauthorized repair, Janeway decides the Maquis crew members need formalized Starfleet training and tasks Tuvok with the job.  Tuvok's unemotional drill-camp begins to put the ""cadets"" on the verge of rebellion while the ship's bio-gel packs begin suffering from a disease that must be eradicated before spreading to all of the ship's systems.
Disc 5:
Special Features - The typical mix of actor interviews and ""how did they do that"" special effects segments.",1069459200,3,7192,4.80940794809408
1966578,5,B000127LW2,"Star Trek Voyager. I never really liked Star Trek before I saw Voyager. I was just channel surfing one day, when I came across the pilot episode, through some stroke of luck. The very first minute, I was hooked. From what bits and pieces of TNG I had seen, this was a great change. For one, it had a female captain. And Voyager also used CGI more beautifully than any other Trek I've seen. I love this series because it portrays human values and emotions in a true and touching way. Voyager is stranded 70,000 light years from home when they are pulled across space by a strange array by an entity called the Caretaker. When the Caretaker dies, he makes Captain Janeway promise that she will destroy the array before it falls into the wrong hands. Captain Janeway keeps her promise, leaving them with no way home. As they make their way across the Delta Quadrant, we see how they survive in an uncharted part of space while staying true to their morals and values. They take in other individuals into their crew, like Seven of Nine, and her struggle to regain her humanity is extremely well portrayed. Special moments like the first time Voyager gets to speak to their loved ones back home are really moving. Voyager is truly an amazing series - My mother, who was a total trek-hater, was hooked and never missed a single episode after watching one episode of Voyager. My friends, who scoffed at Star Trek, became die hard Voyager fans. There was a rumor that Paramount might not release Voyager on DVD, and I was truly upset that that might happen. Thanks Paramount, for deciding to release Voyager on DVD! I cant wait !! :) I'm so happy :)",1069459200,3,1641,4.5286195286195285
1966579,5,B000127LW2,"On January 16, 1995, Star Trek Voyager launched into TV history with Season One. Clearly the best series of the Star Trek franchise, due in large part to an outstanding cast, led by the great Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway. In Season One, we meet the crew as they are thrust into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light years from Earth, and watch two ships of enemies, Star Fleet and Marquis, band together to begin thier perilous journey home. Sporting superb visual effects, excellent writing by Brannon Braga and Jeri Taylor, and one of the best theme songs ever written for television, Star Trek Voyager is a timeless masterpiece of science fiction and human drama.

1966604,5,B000127LW2,"""Voyager"" is perhaps the least appreciated show in the ""Star Trek"" franchise.
Critics have complained about the characters and the storylines for years and yet for those of us who enjoyed the series (and now own DVDs of it) there are many things to love about the years-long journey the ship and its crew took. Chief among them is the fact that it harkened back to the original series in its willingness to confront social issues in the context of a science fiction program. Gender equality, racial equality, religious tolerance, the rights of people to protest what they consider to be unfair treatment and other issues were dealt with in much the same way that Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the ""Enterprise"" did and that made ""Voyager"" interesting to watch.
The cast, headed by Kate Mulgrew as the captain of ""Voyager"" was first rate and the special effects were state of the art for the time period. Since then CGI has made enormous strides so those special effects seem somewhat dated now, but they still stand the test of time in my opinion. Besides, the show did not depend upon those special effects to drive its stories. It was top-flight writing that did that.
For my money, ""Voyager"" was a great series and truly representative of those qualities that have made the ""Star Trek"" franchise an enduring part of television history.",1499212800,2,1345,4.752136752136752

I thought after Deep Space Nine came out, they would've learned from their mistakes and used PROPER cases.  Let's just hope when they're re-released in March that they'll at least switch to the heavy duty blocks that Enterprise and TNG got for their Blu-Ray sets because this is simply disgraceful.",1483660800,2,630,4.557522123893805

1966768,5,B000127LW2,"I think time has a way of making us change our perspectives on art ... in this case, a television series. When ""Star Trek Voyager"" was running its course on television, I was not really impressed with it. Its story line didn't actually fit with my mental map of the Star Fleet Universe. I was still in the Original Series mode. That to me was ""Star Trek"". Now, after a few decades, it is like I am seeing it for the very first time. Not just Voyager, but TNG and DS9 as well. There is a lot more depth to the characters than what I originally gave credit for. So, after running a few of the Original Series, I find that I prefer STV, DS9, and TNG. They are a whole lot better than what I remember.",1482192000,2,697,4.094890510948905
1966769,4,B000127LW2,"I remember the difficulty I had watching this show immediately after the long running Next Generation essentially redefined the Star Trek brand. Where Next Generation was born of confidence (staffed by the best of the best) and interstellar cooperation (look ... a Klingon on the bridge), Voyager was born out of an espionage mission and the resulting betrayals and chaos. Captain Janeway was weak where Captain Picard was unwaverable. Security went from the primal and visceral Worf to the emotionless and intellectual Tuvok. It was a cast of rogues, traitors and neophytes. Back then I just couldn't stick with it. Now, I have returned to the series and appreciate it much more because there is no need to compare it to Next Generation or to expect it to somehow proceed from Next Generation. It turn out that it stands on its own pretty well. Season 1 is mostly an investment in backgound necessary to more fully enjoy the improving story ideas in later seasons. Highlights of Season 1 include Episode 14 - Faces where B'Elanna is literally and metaphorically split in half by the Vidiians to explore ideas about self-acceptance, tempering anger for a higher purpose (courage) and outwitting the need for violence as a solution. Also Episode 15 - Jetrel is recommended for the powerful lesson that there is no winner in a nuclear war or similar event of mass destruction.

Lowlights (least worthwhile episodes) include Episode 11 - State of Flux where the entire Voyager security force is outwitted by a single Cardassian it knows to be a traitor, and Episode 13 - Cathexis which is the first of many failed episodes centered on Chakotay and his poorly conceived ideas on Native American spiritualism. Even setting that aside, the premise of a man-eating nebula shows how bad science makes for bad science fiction.

I still cannot tell whether the story writers intended to employ a running joke about Voyager security being less effective than Barney Fyfe. Watch for yourself and decide. It's either exceptionally subtle Star Trek humor of overuse of a plot device. Watch and enjoy better seasons are ahead.",1482105600,6,2111,4.977337110481586

I started watching again from this, the first episode, because it had been so long since I've seen it. I remember the series as a whole being very good, but in this pilot episode the acting is good, but not great. If your interested you should try it but keep watching more episodes, I think you'll get hook just as I did.  The premise is different than most other Star Trek spinoffs and some of the characters are really innovative.  One of my favorites is ""The Doctor"".

1966821,5,B000127LW2,Follows the orginal series and Generations series game plan with interesting twists. An engaging captain and crew. Nice visual effects for its day. recommended for those that like sci-fi.,1477526400,,187,5.482758620689655
1966822,4,B000127LW2,"I used to watch this series when it did reruns on Fox at midnight so many years ago and really enjoyed it. Quite a few reviews seem to mention how bad of a series this one was and how Deep Space Nine was so much better, but I guess I'm one of the few that hated Deep Space Nine. I never saw anything wrong with this series and I enjoyed the plots and characters, especially The Doctor.

My only issue with this product is the casing. That thin plastic case is so poorly done you can see it will break later down the future and will split off from the ""spine"". While the design is interesting and different, they should have just stuck with a regular DVD case that is sturdy and is not so fragile.",1477353600,,696,4.117647058823529

1966831,5,B000127LW2,"So, please be aware that this is a review from a certain point of view.  That point of view is from a Sci-fi fan in his late 50s.  I actually enjoyed the team work type plots and solutions that the Voyager crew develop and implement.  The show is quite different from the predecessors: SOS, SNG and Enterprise.  Different in that this teamwork extends beyond the craft into the cultures that the crew meets on their way home.  The reality is that some cultures are not interested in working as a team but most, if persuaded adequately, work together.  Even, occasionally, the Borg.

Now I have to say that in all honesty, I did not like the show as a young adult when it first arrived on TV.  Action is used as a last resort and agreeing to disagree is a common theme.

But as an adult I see a lot of value in this type of approach to the Voyager's end goal which is to get home with minimal casualties and more than a few positive relations for the future Federation.",1476921600,10,968,4.303867403314917

1966905,5,B000127LW2,"Over the years I've watched all 7 seasons of Voyager about 6 times total. It isn't my favorite ST series, Star Trek The Next Generation is better IMHO (I'm a millennial, I already know that we suck).
My favorite character in the series has to be Tom Paris, he's one hell of a pilot and gets the crew out of more than one sticky situation.
That being said, the best actor of the entire series is Robert Picardo. Robert Picardo plays the Emergency Medical Hologram (lovingly named ""the Doctor"" because quote, ""why would a hologram need a name?"") who becomes the ships one and only doctor. Yes his character isn't very interesting. The Doctor is pretty much Data the Android from season 1 of TNG, they're always confused about simple human behavior while also being wicked smart. But Robert Picardo really brings this character to life in ways that I doubt the director had in mind at the time.
Lastly, in season 4 an escaped/ rescued human Borg joins the crew played by the lovely Jeri Ryan. She is an amazing actress who plays the character like she was truely born a Borg. Oh and did I mention that she wears a skin tight Borg outfit?

It's a great storyline that the Voyager crew was thrown so far away and had to come back towards earth which would taken them a really long time so they would have to search for technologies that could speed up that return trip. Another interesting aspect is that they would run out of resources: food or fuel. This meant that they had to make do with what they had.

1967065,2,B000127LW2,"The bottom of the Star Trek barrel.

There are some good episodes -- Brad Dourifs little arc in the early seasons is one of the best -- but you'll want to cherrypick. Overall, its a long slog with poor reward. The first wholly enjoyable episodes don't appear until just after the middle of the second season and the show never becomes consistently watchable.

This is the most diverse set of actors -- and somehow the blandest set of characters -- that Rick Berman ever stuffed into a starship.

Neelix comes across like Red Buttons in Space. Mulgrew plays Captain Janeway as though shes channeling Kathryn Hepburn. (Even to the hair.) Roxann Dawson has a tendency to play every scene the same over-excited way. Tuvok is a wind-up Vulcan. Harry Kim and Tom Paris are just nonentities.

Though blessed with a pair of genuinely memorable characters -- Robert Picardos pathologically self-involved holographic doctor and Jennifer Liens tender Kes -- the show over-uses the one and wound up dumping the other for an actress with more obvious charms. (Needless to say, Kes's late-in-the-game return is a standout.)

The only one to emerge with charm largely intact is Robert Beltran.

While the overall concept is novel, it doesnt inform enough of the plots. Most of the stories are just Star Trek filler: The crew over-reaches -- nebula, anomaly, distress call, alien with something up its sleeve -- and the rest of the episode is spent making repairs.

And, speaking of repairs, never has a starship fallen apart more quickly than Voyager.

And pretty much all they do is violate the prime directive.

Ultimately, I did get used to it and with familiarity comes a certain affection.

But its a grudging familiarity and a grudging affection.

And after seven laborious seasons, thats just not enough.",1458604800,,1796,4.9335548172757475

1967258,5,B000127LW2,"The next installment of Gene Roddinberry's Sci fi series, Star trek is called Star trek Voyager. It's based in the same time as Star trek, The next generation in the part of the Galaxy that the Cardassian's and the rebels who were fighting for the independence of the planet Bajore are still in conflict even though there is a peace treaty. During a running fight with one of the rebel spaceships, the starship Voyager is swept away with the rebel ship to another part of the Galaxy, far from where they were and totally stranded in another part of the Galaxy. Now, having not only to find a way to get along with each other, but also having to deal with strange aliens and all the other problems that being in a unexplored part of the Galaxy can throw at you, they have to find a way home that will not take them the 100 plus years that traveling at top speed will take them.

1967370,4,B000127LW2,"Voyager is a 5 star series, but this review is about the DVD package purchased of the first season. All DVDs are complete and play without any glitches. The images are much clearer and the contrast much sharper than what you get watching Netflix. The animation/CGI sequences are outstanding. The sound is great. There are limited menu options which is to be expected since these are older DVDs.

The DVD ""case"" is cool to look at but not practical at all. The first DVD has little protection compared to the others. The top and bottom plastic halves of the case slide off up and down, exposing a book-like arrangement of DVDs, all uncovered on the top side. See my photos. The ""book"" pages protect all but the top DVD. With great care sliding the cover off and on, which tends to catch, I should be able to keep them well protected when accessing the discs.

My biggest gripe is with the menu. It reminds me of the TOS menu. It has cool graphics, sound, and animation with the ship flying into place, one for each episode, followed by your picking the correct ship to access the episode you want. There is no continuous play. Every time an episode ends you have to go back through this entire process to pick the next episode. It's cool once or twice but gets old quickly. If there was an option to see just the episode titles without all the animation that would be great. This format is maddening and frankly a bit juvenille.

I am praying that someday this series will get the recognition it deserves and be released in Blu-ray format. Until then I'll continue to collect all the seasons and put up with this crazy menu. What choice do I have? I love this series.",1432598400,3,1666,4.473684210526316

If you've  never watched star trek start here - you will not be disappointed, and if you are already a star trek fan and haven't watched Voyager what are you waiting for!

1967393,1,B000127LW2,"As a major fan of the original series, TNG, Enterprise and most of DSN I have to warn that if are a traditional Trek fan, you will hate loathe and despise this revolting first season. Frankly until 7 of 9 came along it was all mediocre. But this season is pathetic.

Case in point: Debut episode. Idiotic deus ex machina start but I could live with that. But next, we go to an alien planet and save the rich privileged cute elf people (who refuse to share any resources with the impoverished surface inhabitants) and destroy precious scarce resources.

Case in point: One of the next episodes, some aliens steal a crew member's lungs but get caught. Janeway has the gall to refuse to take the lungs back saying ""Our morals don't allow it"". What crap. Kirk would have ripped them out with his bare hands for Spock and McCoy to restore to the owner.

Over and over again, the same idiotic stuff. If you are into traditional Trek and the other series, you will hate it too. The prices are way too high and from what it appears you will likely get a counterfeit anyway. Not a smart move.",1430524800,,1083,4.405
1967394,5,B000127LW2,"I suspect this episode should be rated much better than the 6.4 of 10 IMDb rating. The Amazon Prime rating is 4.3 of 5 stars or an equivalent 8.6 of 10. That's a more accurate measure. So far very dramatic first season with just the right combination of science, adventure with a moral, human compass to guide it. My hat is off to the story tellers, writers, directors, cast and producers. We need more like this now set in the present or future.",1430524800,,446,4.385542168674699

1967404,5,B000127LW2,"Voyager is classic sci-fi. It's not the best installment of the Trek universe, but it's amazingly good science fiction.

The show has 1 obvious story arc from start to finish, about the Voyager trying to travel the full length of the galaxy to get back to Earth. But along the way they have plenty of mini adventures where the crew has to pull together despite their differences because they only have each other to rely on.

They face old foes like the Borg (who are everywhere) and friends like Q (because what's a Trek series without Q) and lots of new ones that they meet along the way. The individual episodes remind me of 1950's and 60's sci fi stories, only with much high production value. The show even eludes to it's throwback nature by having one of the characters loving to use the Holodeck to relive bad 1950's sci-fi.

Voyager is a fun departure from the Trek series that proceeded it. It's still ""Spacehip flying around meeting aliens"" but it's not constantly arguing with the Klingons and Romulans.

It's well worth watching for the fun ride it is.",1429574400,2,1064,4.613756613756614

I always thought that Voyager was unappreciated when it was broadcast and it is amazing that it is 20 years since these episodes were originally aired.

My conclusion: the Captain Janeway episodes are some of the best writing and most creative. The episodes only got questionable in the last season as the original writers left.  My favorite as most creative - the Flash Gordon homage with holodeck character, Chaotica & Queen Arachnia, played by Captain Janeway. Other reviewers complain Seven is just ""eye candy"". Wrong! She's more logical than a Vulcan and makes the best decisions. The tension between the individual and the collective is highlighted. Every Star Trek series had its sex appeal character - Captain Kirk & every female alien, Kes, T'Pol.  I'll leave the quality of the DVDs and Blu-Ray discs to other reviewers.",1426377600,,829,4.9

1967474,5,B000127LW2,"Star Trek Voyager started out with a really great premise, as usual.  As they travel, things happen and the change in plans made it get even better.  Adding Chakotay and B'Elanna Torres from the Maquis was a brilliant move for Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).

After Episode 1, the entire raison d'tre for the combined crew is return to Earth if the ""Caretaker"" allows.

Voyager had the good fortune to have followed a line of successful Star Trek programs.  Each in their own way was unique yet comfortable enough to easily assimilate into the lore of Star Trek.",1424217600,,562,4.752577319587629
1967475,4,B000127LW2,"If you like Voyager, you need to have this in your collection, as it gives you the beginning story lines for the series. Some of the episodes are a bit contrived, but this is to be expected in a first season.",1423440000,,208,4.097560975609756
1967476,2,B000127LW2,"Most people who give poor reviews of this series complain about the box, or the features, or the dvds not working correctly.  My review is different. it, ke
I just happen to think that the 1st season of Voyager is very poorly written.  I never cared for the ""lost in space"" genre this series is crafted after.  It was a blatant attempt to make a new series of TNG.  There was very little structure in the evolution of the series.  There were no conflicts with various species that I particularly cared for.  I found the Kazons to be a poor enemy; same goes for the Vidiians.  Seska didn't help matters, and I found many of the episodes gave the voyage a daunting and hopeless aspect, instead of fun and exciting.  Captain Janeway seemed more concerned with exploring than urgently trying to find methods to get the crew home as quickly as possible.  Bad character script writing in my opinion.
That being said, Voyager did show glimmers of hope.  I loved many of the characters they introduced.  Janeway and Chakotay's relationship was timeless, and I was pleased to know that they got closer over the seasons.  The Doctor is my favorite character.  He's incredible, and his development as a character mirrors Voyager's journey.  As the Doctor is on his own quest to become real and human, Voyager is trying to get back to humanity and the Alpha Quandrant.  Neelix was also a pleasant surprise.  He was the only alien in the Delta Quadrant I liked.  I never cared for Kes though.  I felt that she as a character was not developed properly.  After ""Caretaker"" almost nothing was said about the Caretaker's mate/partner who could definitely send them home.  It was as if the first episode didn't happen at all.
The good thing is that the subsequent seasons keep getting better and better.  Overall, Voyager is a great series; it just gets off to a slow start.  Watch the First Season, and if you're like me, and don't really like it, keep watching, because the seasons get better and better.",1423094400,,1989,4.655172413793103

Her humane, selfless actions - and her motivational words - in the face of the huge order of finding a way home - one that they might never realize - touched me so deeply.",1422662400,,471,4.329545454545454

1967504,3,B000127LW2,"""Voyager"" is my all-time favorite TV series, and I've been watching it since about the turn of the century. (So that's what, fourteen years?) Some might argue that this accounts for my IQ; but I say ""Voyager"" is a great series!  However, I'm not rating the series here; I'm rating this first season. And Season 1 is...okay.

If I'd started watching ""Voyager"" from the beginning, I would likely have lost interest pretty quickly. Season 1 is by no means bad, and it has a few fantastic episodes. But the show was still three seasons away from finding its voice. This season is probably better appreciated by someone already familiar with the show, than a ""Voyager"" virgin.

If you're like me, and became familiar with ""Voyager"" when it was later in its run, then I would say, watch ""Season 1"" for the back-story. You'll understand a lot more about the situation and the characters, and it's also great to see how a lot of the characters have changed over the years. B'Elanna, Tom, and Harry especially have the best growth over the years. In the first season they're essentially a trio of adolescents, who ""grow up"" over the course of the seven-year journey.

To those who've just begun watching ""Voyager,"" I say, stick with it until it gets better. Or, if you haven't the patience, go ahead and skip the first two seasons (for now). The only episode you really need to see in order to understand the later seasons is ""Caretaker."" For the most part, it's an episodic series, and the few bits of back-story you do need, they do a pretty good job of clarifying in episodes where they become relevant.

The fad nowadays is to watch entire TV shows in airing order. But since ""Voyager"" is an episodic show, not a serial one, you might find it more fun to just pick and choose random episodes to watch. If you decide to go that route, then I'll recommend a few episodes to keep your eyes peeled for.

First, the plot-moving episodes. That is, episodes you'll want to watch, just so you get an understanding of certain story arcs:

""Caretaker"" (The first and most important episode)
""Parallax"" (Where certain ranks, namely B'Elanna's, are decided upon)
""Phage"" (Which introduces the Vidiians, and shows how Kes becomes nurse)
""State of Flux"" (In which Seska's true identity is revealed)

And, episodes to watch just because they're good:

*  All of the above mentioned episodes
""The Cloud"" (Rare example of an alien on ""Star Trek"" that's actually interesting)
""The Eye of the Needle"" (Featuring a sympathetic Romulan)
""Prime Factors"" (A great moment where some recurring characters get to shine)
""Cathexis"" (Chakotay spends most of the episode shirtless)
""Faces"" (A must-see for any fan of B'Elanna Torres)
""Learning Curve"" (A good ""lower-decks"" episode, with some unforgettable moments, including Chakotay punching one of his own crewman, and B'Elanna declaring, ""Get the cheese to sickbay!"")

VERDICT:

A good season, but not one of the best.",1418169600,,2937,4.86372745490982

1967569,4,B000127LW2,"Star Trek original and Next Generation are the best, then Voyager then Deep Space Nine then (gulp) Enterprise.

Cast does a very good job and Jennifer Lien's character Kes is one of the most compelling and not because she's cute as a button, but because she does a great job with her character. Russ as Tuvok, McNiel as Paris and Mulgrew as a very believable Captain. Whole cast does a great job.

Did not like the violations of the prime directive, there are a ton. A meritocracy with the Prime Directive exploring space and strange new worlds are a great platform and should not be discarded so easily. Like another reviewer said, Voyager does a nice job of getting back to exploring space, and the human condition.

More soap opera than I like...but more true to sci-fi than BSG or Deep Space Nine and a whole ton better than Enterprise which lost its way.

If you have seen the new Battlestar Galactica you will recognize a lot of the same themes, storylines and the overall feel were on Voyager first and for good reason. Some of the same people behind the scenes on both shows. Both ships on their own far from home with limited resources, etc. Only Voyager doesn't demonize technology and promote religion like BSG does, thanks for that.",1408492800,,1244,4.615384615384615

  Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) is not yet gushing her Katharine Hepburn persona (whom I am not fond of).

Some of the episodes made me think the writers were getting blocked, bored and/or tired... but overall Voyager is the best Trek!",1397433600,,349,4.783333333333333

1967639,2,B000127LW2,"WORSE packaging I ever ever seen wrapped around a DVD season of... anything.  The plastic box comes apart in half, top and bottom, the DVDs are stored in a plastic ""book"" arrangement, but that isn't the worst part.  Once a disc is inside your player, you have to jump through several hoops just to get it to Play, and it's one episode at a time!  There is NO MENU either.  The disc goes in, it goes to a screen with three or four episodes laid out in, you guessed it, ""Quadrants,"" you have to keep track of the episode numbers so you know which one to Play in what order, then when you hit Play it enlarges the Enterprise on the screen but still doesn't Play!  After that it goes to yet another screen where it shows the Enterprise within a grid, and you have to ""Launch"" the DVD in order for it to play the episode.  At the end you're taken back to the last screen, so have to work your way out of there again to get back to the screen where it shows the episodes in the Quadrants.  Then using your arrow keys get to the next episode and go through it all again.  I haven't been this annoyed in quite awhile.  I only have Seasons 1 and 2 and can't decide if I want to risk buying other seasons if I have to work so hard just to get the episodes to play.  It's ridiculous.",1396656000,2,1272,4.072289156626506

1967660,5,B000127LW2,After the original Star Trek series this is my favorite.  I love the strong but kind and caring personality of Kate Mulgrew as Capt. Janeway.

The premise of the series (The crew of Voyager trying to get home after being stranded 75 light years from Earth) combined with the great interaction among the crew of the Voyager being forced to join with the rebel Maquis -- along with the introduction of great new characters and ""species,"" makes Voyager an interesting, must-see series for any fan of Star Trek or scifi in general.",1393459200,,457,4.617283950617284

And they all seem so ""human"" in their foibles and survival. Maybe because of the premise of the show, where they are stuck together for a potentially very long time, zillion of light years from Earth, is why they start to become family and the progression is so natural and they are all quite at ease with each other. I also like the fact that the show addresses some great lessons about acceptance of souls not like yourself along the way without pounding you over the head with them!",1393459200,,632,4.504347826086956

I hope that future series go back to the ENT roots, or TOS.

Nevertheless, a series about the Enterprise-J set in the year 3,000 against the Sphere Builders could be interesting.

It could be an exciting way to tie things in from ENT.

However, the best option, now, it to re-explore TOS timeline.",1393113600,,414,4.680555555555555

1967675,3,B000127LW2,"Science fiction is supposed to have some science as a basis for the stories, but this series (season 1) leans too far to the mystical for my taste.  However, the series does have some interesting characters and the actors do show talent.  My opinion is that the series (season 1) is not a total failure and I'm hoping for improvement in later seasons.  Two characters stand out in season 1: Janeway and the Doctor.  Janeway, the captain, is decisive and so well acted that she is believable as a starship captain.  The doctor, presented as a computerized hologram, is still very human and is somewhat parallel to ""Data"" in ""Star Trek next generation"" and is perhaps my favorite Star Trek character.",1392249600,,698,4.735537190082645

Second, it started strong out of the gate- almost all the other series had to find their footing over several episodes. Third, the characters are stellar for a wide range of reasons and finally the premise of being far from home and trying to get back is powerful.",1391299200,,419,4.384615384615385

Streaming this series on Amazon Video is included with Amazon Prime for a yearly fee which also includes many other shows and 2nd day delivery on most everything you buy on Amazon. The yearly fee is much less than buying DVDs of this series. And Amazon video works with my Vizio TVs and iPad. The quality is decent, certainly better than the original analog broadcast, but not HD.

If you like Star Trek, you should like Voyager. My understanding is that, like DS9, it gets more exciting in later seasons after starting out more touchy-feely in the early seasons.",1390867200,,731,4.7109375

Finished with season 1. Have to say it kinda felt, even for a first season, kinda cheap.
The sets were very generic, spend way more time on the ship than the OS or TNG did. They had several repeat scenarios - sure they changed things around a bit, but really, how many mysterious energy fields could the ship get caught in (almost) every week?

Extremely miminal feeling crew. Sure OS and TNG (and most shows for that matter) have their key cast they focus on. But for this show it really feels like they only focus on a specific 9 characters and nearly never include anyone else. At least with TNG it felt like there were more characters than that.

Going to start season 2, hope it gets better, really would like to finish out the series - don't even think I watched it all back when it was new - without it being a struggle to get through each episode.",1390521600,,961,4.35754189944134

1967780,1,B000127LW2,"Where to begin?

The cast has absolutely no chemistry.  None.  I've met paper bags who could deliver lines more convincingly.  The actors seem to have no sense of what their characters' goals are, or their hopes, or dreams, or the gravity of being stuck seventy years from home.  Though this could be because of the show's exceptionally bad writing.

Oh yes.  The writing.  The original series had the Klingons and the Romulans, two technologically powerful and mysterious races bent on the Federation's destruction.  TNG had the Borg, a race of space zombies consuming everything in its path.  DS9 had the Dominion, a sort of anti-Federation powerful enough to cause all the usual Alpha-Quadrant antagonists to ally together in self defense.  In a lot of ways much of Star Trek is defined by the Federation's enemies.

So who does Voyager have?  The Kazon.  If you don't know who they are (they're really forgettable) they look sort of like that guy on the History Channel who claims aliens built the pyramids.  They're nomads, they have no hierarchy and consist of different clans that war for control of, I'm not sure what really, but they shoot at each other as much as everyone else, and their technology is about thirty years behind Voyager's.  Not much of a threat there, but somehow Voyager keeps getting into fights with them for years.  Like, if these people have slow moving ships and yours is much faster and you're moving away from them, shouldn't you stop running into them after a while?

Nope.

So yeah, the writing is bad.  At some point the producers just gave up and started rehashing old TNG plots.  Q shows up, and they take away the best part about TNG by explaining everything about him (ala the new Star Wars trilogy and midichlorians).  They of course encounter the Borg and the producers, wanting to wrap everything up nicely after 44 minutes, make them essentially harmless.  There's never a sense of danger, any indication at all that Voyager might be destroyed, because any time there is a serious threat and Voyager gets the snot kicked out of it you can rest assured that the episode will end with the reset button getting hit.  Be it through time travel, a spatial anomaly, a copy of Voyager, whatever, something will happen such that Voyager will make it through unscathed and marginally closer to the Alpha-Quadrant.

This kind of laziness in writing trickles down to the characters too.  Everyone behaves wildly different from episode to episode.  Some days Janeway gleefully violates the Prime Directive for seemingly trivial reasons.  Other days she's its most stalwart defender.  Also she seems to be an expert on every facet of her ship, to the point where she knows more about Engineering, Science, Operations, and Tactical than the respective heads of those groups.  But it's not just her.  Everyone seems to be an expert on whatever system is needed to advance the plot along with whichever characters just happen to be the room.  Including, hilariously enough, the ship's cook who really should have been thrown out of an airlock the first episode.  Also, the crew of Voyager is made up of Starfleet and Maquis officers and soldiers who just days before had been ready to kill each other, but after like three episodes they're all best buddies.  Shouldn't there have been some mutual loathing, or at the very least, mistrust?

Another example is the technobabble.  Sure Trek has always relied on it but the writers of Voyager didn't know how to make an episode without it.  So rather than seeing the characters grow or change in interesting ways, or the backdrop of the Delta-Quadrant change, we get a bunch of blathering about nucleogenic or polaric or tetrionic or omega particles and blah blah with the neurogenic packs infected and the dylithium reaction failing and on and on and on instead of a plot.

There are occasional moments of decency though.  Robert Picardo has some interesting plots as a hologram slowly becoming more human.  Jeri Ryan, too, plays a former Borg drone rediscovering her individuality and identity.  That said, both of those characters felt like they were little more than ripoffs of Brent Spiner's Data in TNG.

1967787,4,B000127LW2,"Bottom Line: This is a solid series and you could do far worse than to watch this series. While not my favorite series in the Star Trek Franchise, I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend to anyone.

The original Star Trek was intended as sort of a cross between CAPT Cook's journey of exploration and a western set in space. In many ways, this series is a return to that basic premise. Indeed, the CAPT Cook aspect is pretty strong, the Star ship Voyager is transported in space to a quadrant that will take years, maybe even generations to cross.

However, unlike CAPT Cook, CAPT Janeway has a mixed crew.  The mission that resulted in her ship being stranded in the Delta Quadrant involved chasing a group of insurgents that are fighting the Federation over a treaty that resulted in them losing their colonies to an alien empire. As the crew progresses they pick up a few strays as well. A Borg that has been separated from the collective. A survivor from a destroyed planet. Last but not least, Tom Paris, a former Starfleet officer, turned insurgent, turned informer, who finally freed from his father's expectations and his failures, becomes one of the most important crew members.

While a part of the crew from the beginning, the ""Doctor"", an Emergency Medical Holographic (EMH) Program, provides the basis for some very important episodes that address the nature of humanity and reality.

Seven of Nine (Jenni Ryan),  a de-assimilated borg, becomes a very interesting character as the series progresses. While I suspect that she was introduced as a character to encourage more teen age boys to watch (Jenni Ryan has a fantastic body and they dress her in skin tight cat suites), she becomes a venue for many interesting stories about what it means to be an adult (she was assimilated by the borg as a young girl and is somewhat immature), what it means to be an individual who is also part of a team, and how one builds meaningful relationships with others.

Chakotay is the commander of the insurgents. He becomes CAPT Janeway's first officer. As a former Starfleet CDR, one suspects that he might have been senior to CAPT Janeway until he left Starfleet to become an insurgent and she got promoted to CAPT. One also get the idea that other than the adventure of Starfleet, he had rebelled against authority and becoming the ship's executive officer was not an easy transition for him.

Many of the early episodes deal with how the Voyager crew finds fuel and food as they cross the Delta Quadrant.  While helpful to the storyline, they aren't always the best episodes. In my humble opinion, the best episodes are in season six.

I recommend this series and will probably watch it again in the future.",1372896000,,2714,4.743099787685775

1967790,5,B000127LW2,"I was watching every Star Trek they put on TV, until Voyager.  Partly personal reasons, I just stopped watching it after the first couple of seasons.  In my mind, TNG was the best, then DS9, then Enterprise, then Voyager.  I've been watching a lot of DS9 on Amazon and decided I was past the chronological point where Voyager started and I wanted to watch them in parallel, so I just finished Season 1 of Voyager.  It gets going much better much faster than either TNG or DS9, in my humble opinion.  Admittedly, I'm looking forward to catching up so I can get some DS9 back in - but that's partly because back over on that side the Dominion War is about to get started and I have fond memories of the show and various video games that came out around that time (Bridge Commander).

One thing... Amazon has messed up something and included some Season 2 episodes as part of ""Season 1"".  If you go to wikipedia you can see the correct breakdown of seasons.  Only Episodes 1-15 are really part of Season1.  Ep 16-19, which jump to that fall are really the beginning of Season 2.  Not sure why the mistake.  Maybe nobody cares since we're all likely to just binge watch episodes these days :-)",1372636800,,1189,4.433179723502304
1967791,3,B000127LW2,"This show had sooooo much potential.  The premise: a federation ship lost at the other end of the galaxy --- excellent.  The crew: Maquis and Federation staff having to work together to get home --- great.  The possibilities: unimaginable and mind-bending lifeforms to be found on the journey home, unlike anything experienced before --- phenomenal.  Unfortunately, all of this is barely touched upon.  The journey home was like any other TNG exploration mission; there is no sense of despair, loneliness, and anxiety to get back --- stupid.  The crews work together immediately with the Maquis being integrated throughout the ships crew AND taking on the Federation uniforms --- ridiculous.  When they find lifeforms, they are almost ALL humanoids who SPEAK ENGLISH and SHARE SIMILAR cultural nuances, and all referred to by the generic term ""ALIEN"" --- preposterous!!  (Neelix of ALL people should have been made less ""American Human"".)  Where is the uniqueness in this??  (Maybe this happened a lot in TNG and TOS, but we are way beyond that now.)  What should have gracefully evolved over the course of 2-3 seasons (e.g., dire need to get home, Maquis taking on the uniform in later seasons, and finding more humanoids as an indicator of getting closer to home) was done over the course of the pilot and subsequent 2-3 episodes.  Completely rushed for no reason.  (Mind you, I hold DS9 as the pinnacle of Trek; barring the first 2 seasons, it is the best Trek, in my opinion.)  Instead this season is dumbed down, and the only real saving graces were Tuvok and The Doctor, of all people --- the least emotional. Janeway was not bad, but I can definitely accept her as captain and Chakotay would have been better off portraying a person of Mexican heritage instead because the nuances of being a Native American don't really come through this character.  Fortunately, season 2 starts turning this around with creative stories that center more on declining resources on their journey home and it provides more ""reasons"" for why they find humanoids so far away from Earth.  Here's hoping things get better.",1372550400,,2107,4.9601139601139606

Voyager is the Trek universe's answer to that series. Voyager is about a Federation ship whisked to the opposite side of the galaxy, 75 years away from home, and its adventures on the trek back.

Add in a captain played as the reincarnation of Kate Hepburn, a crew composed of the formerly opposed crews of the Federation ship and the Maquis ship it was pursuing, a holographic doctor who's equal parts Bones and Data (the ever-present ""Spock premise"" about humanness arising out of the tension between rational self-interest and concern for others), and visual beauty - including the ship itself, models of which a local crafts shop had trouble keeping in stock because it was so popular (as Hepburn said in The Philadelphia Story, ""That ship was yar"") - and you have a great show.",1371340800,,1239,4.731481481481482

1967817,5,B000127LW2,"I've always loved Star Trek.  When I was really little, my favorite ""adult"" show was The Next Generation.  Even though I could barely grasp it, there was always something appealing about it.  My favorite episode of the Reading Rainbow was the one with the behind the scenes look at TNG.  Later, we started renting episode of the Original Series from our local libraries, & I loved those too.  They don't hold up as well as The Next Generation does.  While there are some really good episodes, one thing drags it down:  William Shatner.  Everything else is good, but Kirk's acting is so annoying.  I also watched some of Deep Space 9 on TV, which I loved, as well as Voyager.  For a few weeks I went over to my aunt's house next door & we'd watch Voyager together.  It was my least favorite at the time, but now I'd definitely rank it above TOS.  I got this after an acquaintance of mine recommended it to me.  He said that this was his favorite Star Trek after TNG, because while it was never as good as TNG, it had no bad episodes (I've seen 4 bad episodes in TNG season 1 already, & I'm sure I'll see more before I'm through).  I've halfway through season 2, & I'm inclined to agree with him.

1-2.  Caretaker:  On a mission to the Badlands, the USS Voyager, along with a Maquis ship, is stranded in the Delta Quadrant, more than 70,000 light-years from home by an incredibly powerful being known as ""Caretaker.""  The best pilot I've ever seen for a Star Trek show.  A

3.  Parallax:  Voyager is trapped in a quantum singularity's event horizon, and Captain Janeway must decide between Lt. Carey and former Maquis B'Elanna Torres to be the new chief engineer.  B

4.  Time and Again  Captain Kathryn Janeway and Tom Paris are sent back in time one day before an alien planet is annihilated. They attempt to stop the explosion that destroys the planet.  B+

5.  Phage:  An organ-harvesting species known as the Vidiians steal Neelix's lungs, leaving him to die.  A

6.  The Cloud: The crew enters a nebula to collect samples before realizing it is a living organism.  A-

7.  Eye of the Needle:  A micro-wormhole is discovered that leads to the Alpha Quadrant, and the crew make contact with a Romulan ship on the other side.  B+

8.  Ex Post Facto:  Tom Paris is convicted of murder on an alien world, and his punishment is reliving the murder from the victim's perspective every 14 hours.  An excellent noir episode, directed by LeVar Burton, proving that any Star Trek actor can direct better than Shatner.  A+

9.  Emanations:  Harry Kim is transported to an alien world at the same time a dead body arrives on Voyager.  A

10.  Prime Factors:  A race that could shorten Voyager's journey with a transportation device will not share its technology.  B

11.  State of Flux:  Janeway and the other senior officers attempt to flush out a spy who is sending information to the Kazon.  A

12.  Heroes & Demons:  The holographic doctor must rescue crew members who were turned to energy in the Holodeck, by entering a holodeck program of Beowulf.  I hate holodeck episodes but this was redeemed by a spotlight on my favorite character, the Doctor.  B

13.  Cathexis:  An alien mind takes over crew-members' bodies, and Chakotay is left apparently brain-dead after something attacks his shuttlecraft.  A typical plot but good enough & had a good twist.  B

14.  Faces:  B'Elanna Torres is split into her human and Klingon halves by the Vidiians.  An excellent episode, featuring one of the most gruesome deaths of a red shirt.  A+

15.  Jetrel:  A member of the Haakonians, a race warring with the Talaxians arrives on Voyager, much to the dismay of Neelix, whose family was killed by them.  My favorite episode of the season, apart from maybe Faces.  A+

16.  Learning Curve:  Tuvok trains several Maquis members who have not fully integrated into the Voyager crew.  B

A good set.  The most annoying thing about the show is that failure is the only option when it comes to getting back home.  Apart from that, it's worthy of the Star Trek name.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the series, especially the ones with Q.",1369785600,,4122,4.572413793103448

The signal from that station was terrible, so we gave up after a few weeks.  It wasn't because of the quality of the program, though.

Voyager takes the normal Star Trek premise, but tweaks it by cutting the ship off from the typical resources they have access to by kicking them to the other side of the galaxy. The overarching plot is their search to get home. There are some really nice episodes in the opening season.  I particularly liked ""Jetrel"" where an alien is faced to confront his perceptions of a genocidal event in his people's history. Another fun episode is ""The 37's"" where we find out what actually happened to Amelia Erhardt. These two span the spectrum of Star Trek writing, too. Jetrel is full of moral ambiguities and challenges us to think outside our own perspective where The 37's has a very positive and hopeful message. I plan on continuing the voyages of the Starship Voyager through the other six seasons.

The video quality is pretty miserable. CBS hasn't done any restoration and Amazon's compression scheme hasn't done the show any benefits. The episode ""Learning Curve"" has tons of weird artifacts that make you suspect the whole episode was shot in front of a green screen, but the effect is seen in shots you know are on a full set. It looks better than it did when I watched it on the weak UHF station in the 90s, but I wouldn't even call it DVD-quality video--maybe VHS+.

I never expect much from streamed audio, and there were no issues to report with this season's. It sounds like Star Trek. Voices are clear.

If you have a Prime subscription, then give the show a watch. That's the basis of my 4-star rating.

  I have not purchased all of season 1 yet.  But I have bought  the first 7 episodes and I have l have always like The Star Trek Voyager  when it was on tv, so so so many years ago! If I could buy the whole set 1-7 right now I would! But when you are short of money it has to take time, and little by little!!!!
  I am very grateful that Amazon is allowing you to buy them one at a time here on their website on video on demand or all of the seasons you are watching!!!  Oh I wished I had known about it much earlier, but lost internet for 2 months, and I had other commitments to honor. And When I got my internet back and I came to my Amazon Acount and saw the deal they were having, I bought and watched 7 Episodes so far of season 1 and I love them!!!!! I can't wait til I can buy more, but when money is short it takes time!
 THANK YOU AMAZON, FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THE STAR TREK VOYAGER  SERIES!!!! Had I not had other commitments I would have bought the whole season 1 set, because I would have been able to save money! But I did not have it.  But THANK YOU !!!!!  If you have this same offer next month I would be able then!
  I use to when I was younger, watch all the STAR TREK SHOWS, But When They Came Out With Star Trek Voyager, It Became My Very Favorite!!!!!  I have had the Whole SERIES On My Wish List, But just did not have the money to purchase It!
  I hope anyone who loves Star Trek Voyager takes advantage of the offer that Amazon is offering now, and I hope they will continue it  longer for those who are on a fixed or low income budget so we can own the complete series!

After crewman Dalby doesn't follow Federation guidelines while doing repairs he is insubordinate with Tuvok.  Janeway suggests a field training program run by Tuvok to bring the troublesome Maquis in line and Chakotay agrees....

This is a pretty good episode as this brings out more of the personalities of the crew and their interactions with each other.  The question really lies in do you have to always follow the book or follow your mind and heart at times?

I like the lessons that Tuvok and the trainees learn and I loved Chakotay's actions with his own people.  I recommend this episode as worth watching.",1351900800,,710,4.883333333333334

He was the chief scientist of the Haakonians who defeated Talax in a devastating and horrific war 15 years before.  The scientist is responsible for developing the weapon of mass destruction that killed hundreds of thousands of Talaxians, including Neelix's own family.  Neelix must also face his own personal demons in remembering the war and his actions at that time......

This is an OK episode but I couldn't shake the feeling that the writers were trying to bring back the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and asking if the developers of the bomb should feel responsible and have remorse for the use of their bomb. It was an interesting scenario but a little too much of a political theme for me.  I gave the episode a 3 star rating as I felt that Neelix's acting was over the top as his character usually is.  I also felt that Janeway is always too trusting of every stranger and alien race she meets and it is a naive approach to meeting a new alien race every week.  This is still a good series and you should watch this episode as it does give tremendous insight into the character of Neelix.",1351900800,,1177,4.47196261682243

This is a very good episode and as it contains some action and a deep insight into the personality and character of B'Elanna Torres.  You finally get to see the struggle of personalities that she faced during her entire life.

This is a good episode and I recommend it to you.",1351728000,,649,4.286885245901639

This is a pretty good episode with an alien invader with a plan that can threaten the lives of the Voyager crew.  I enjoyed this episode and it was probably a 3.5 rating but I rolled it up to a 4.  This series has not had a lot of action since the first episode that started the season.  There have been some good stories like this one and the action was higher in this one.

His last known location was on the holodeck which is acting strangely and the safety controls are not working.

Tuvok and Chakotay are sent in to investigate what is wrong and they find the holodeck running a program on Beowulf. While looking for the missing Kim they are told that he was killed by the Grendel. When they confront the Grendel they also disappear from the ship....

This is a good story and interesting but it certainly does not carry the kind of action you would find in most Star Trek episodes. This first season is starting slowly and the story line is a strange one. Mission number one is to return back to earth which is 75 years away at top speed and yet every episode they are off course and stopping which will turn the mission into a 150 year journey. They are also having such energy problems that they cannot use the food replicators but they continue to use the holodeck in multiple episodes.

I rated this episode a 3 star rating as the story is interesting but there is not really much Sci-Fi involved in this one. It is interesting to watch but don't expect a lot of action. At least the doctor gets a major role in this mission.",1351468800,,1517,4.4496402877697845

The Kasons shoot Chakotay as he and the ensign shoot both of them. The Voyager leaves orbit but Chakotay was injured as is recovering in sick bay.

Shorty later the Kazon ship sends out a distress call.  The voyager responds but finds only one survivor on board as they appear to have been killed while testing a Federation piece of technology.  How did they get it......

It appears that the crew of the Voyager may have a traitor on board and Tuvok and Chakotay begin an investigation.  Can it be that a trusted member of the crew is really selling Federation technology?  This is a really good story and the action begins to pick up in this episode.

They are from the planet Sikaria and he offers that they come to their planet and have a vacation and take shore leave.  Captain Janeway easily agrees and the Sikarians offers the crew gifts. They want Janeway and the officers to stay on the planet for dinner as their guests. Kim has met a woman who is a scientist and they hit it off.

The suns come up and two suns rise in the morning sky and Kim realizes that they are on a different planet.  They teleported 40,000 light years in less than a second......

Living by the Federation Prime directive suddenly has a different meaning when the crew realizes they are the race with inferior technology.  What they refuse to give to other needy races is now denied to them and it could save the crew decades of travel on the way home.  This is a good episode with a good storyline.  It was interesting to see the shoe on the other foot so to speak.  This episode is a 4 star one and it is worth watching.",1351123200,,1413,4.3869731800766285

When they beam into the caverns they find that the caverns are filled with webs and hundreds of dead humanoid bodies wrapped in the same webs.

For safety reasons they are transporting to the Voyager at the same time and Chakotay and Torres arrive but Harry Kim is missing and replaced by a dead alien body on the transporter pad.......

This is not a bad story and it leads to the insight of an alien religious belief and how it affects their behavior and culture.  It is worth watching and it is a fairly good story.",1351123200,,977,4.56

Tom is sentenced in the Benean's way of punishment and is forced to relive the last moments of his victims life and death over and over.

Janeway asks Tuvok to prove Tom's innocence before the conviction penalty destroys his mind and his sanity......

This episode is just OK to me as it did not really involve much Sci-Fi.  It is more of mystery theatre style of program and while it was good it is not what you are expecting from a good Star Trek episode.  I rate this as a three star episode.  You should watch it but it was just average for me.",1351123200,,848,4.322784810126582

They arrive at the worm hole only to find that it is very small and caused by a micro singularity.  It is only 30 cm in diameter (A little less than one foot in diameter).  They won't fit through it but perhaps they can send a message back home. And to test this theory they send a micro probe through the hole. The worm hole may be ancient and been collapsing for centuries. The probe gets stuck but it is scanned by someone on the other side.

The probe cannot free itself and will be crushed in 72 hours. They try to transmit a message to whoever is on the other side using the probe as a re-transmitter. They hope to transmit messages to home that they are alive. They send the signal and a response signal comes back. The signal is from the Alpha Quadrant, home!.....

The bridge crew sees a small nebula on the long range sensors. They decide to go there as the ship's sensors pick up omnicron particles that they need to collect for the antimatter converters. More energy means that Janeway gets real coffee....

This is a good episode as the crew finds a new galactic life form that was heretofore never discovered or believed to exist.  The crew also begins to bond together as a team and interacts with each other in a much better way.  The old hatred of the Maquis and the Federation crew members is a thing of the past.

I liked this episode as Janeway seems to relax and begins to not be a stiff and formal and the crew members begin to show friendship towards each other.  I recommend this episode to you.",1350950400,,1380,4.47011952191235

This episode is the first with the introduction of an advanced alien race infected with a disease called the Phage.  It is a horrible malady that leads to catastrophic organ failure and death.  The aliens have been fighting it for thousands of years and it is a losing battle.  This is a pretty good episode and the actors are beginning to find their proper acting style for their characters and the episodes are getting better.

This episode for me was not that exciting.  I love Star Trek and for me to say that about an episode is unusual.  Perhaps it is because I have seen so many time travel stories in this and other Star Trek episodes. Janeway in this episode just looked like she was reading cue cards with her script on them.  Her voice at times was flat and monotonous.

For a new series and the third episode I just found this a lackluster story and I would have thought that the producers would have wanted to put out an exciting storyline to grab your interest and not this one which was just barely OK.",1350777600,,1241,4.22457627118644

B'Elanna Torres is becoming a problem as her Klingon blood makes her emotional and violent at times and unable to control her aggression.  Commander Chakotay pushes her upon Janeway to become the next Chief Engineer but Torres has already broken the nose of present lead in the engineering department.

The Voyager and her crew are faced with a life threatening encounter with a quantum singularity and Janeway has to use all of the crew to find the best solutions to save their lives.  Can the Maquis and Federation crewmembers stop fighting and get along enough to gel together as a team.....

It is hard to put aside old hatreds and distrust and that is what the crew is facing.  Janeway is discovering that many of the Maquis are highly skilled and talented people and that she must learn to use them and trust them if the Voyager is to survive.

This episode is used to bring along the cast's backgrounds and develop the character personalities even further.  It is a good one and I enjoyed watching it.  I recommend it to you.",1350691200,,1489,4.641221374045801

The Voyager is launched from Deep Space Nine on a mission to find a missing Maquis ship.  Janeway is highly interested to find the ship as one of her top officers is on board as an undercover spy for the Federation.  Janeway takes a former Maquis who is imprisoned to go with her on the mission and his name is Tom Paris.  The Maquis ship disappeared in the Badlands and once the Voyager enters into the area they find themselves being scanned and suddenly transported, ship and all, 70,000 light years to the Delta Quadrant.

Some of the crew died in the transfer and now they are short staffed and facing an unknown situation with a large space array in front of them operated by a powerful alien presence that they have to convince to send them back home....

The first episode sets up the character list and tries to help develop their personalities and skills so you can begin to understand their roles and the entire series.  If you intend to watch this series then this episode is a must to watch as you will understand why they are in the Delta Quadrant and why they can't get home so easily.  This is a good story line and you will enjoy it.  Some of the acting is rather stiffly done as the actors begin to feel out their roles and learn how to mature their acting into the characters they are trying to play.  Captain Janeway comes across as overpowering and arrogant at times in this episode but her personality changes as the season goes on.

The streaming worked fine and I had absolutely no problems or issues at all with it.  I could easily pause, back up and fast forward through the show without problems.  The series is broadcast in 480 P 4:3 but I used an HDMI cable and expanded the picture to fill the screen  of a 55 inch LCD TV and it came out clear and I have no complaints at all.

I enjoyed watching this episode again and I recommend it to you, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.",1350691200,,2110,4.2269326683291775
1967900,5,B000127LW2,"The highlight for me was seeing the first episode-Caretaker. I did not see that episode while the series was on TV in syndication. So it was a treat seeing that episode for the first time. For me the best episodes for Season One was Caretaker because it introduces the series, the characters, and how two space vessels would wind up deep in the delta quadrant some 70,000 light years away from Earth. The second good episode was Parallax. Here we see how the Federation and Maquis crews are intergrated into one crew that will function really well together throughout the series.

Also what sets this series apart from the other Star Trek series is the selection of a female captain-Kathryn Janeway. Throughout the series I would come to love her as the captain and she was a good one. I would have no problem serving under her and this is coming from someone who served in the military,

There is a book that describes all the major characters. It gets into their life history to include events that leads to how they would wind up on Voyager. the book is titled Star Trek Voyager Pathways. If one wants to learn more about the major characters this book is worth checking out.

As for the packaging it's not bad. Each disc is in it's own compartment. The one drawback is that the episode titles are not printed on the disc or the packaging. The only way one can learn the episode titles is to put the disc in the player. it is something I can live with. Also there were no problems with the discs after playing them. Also Amazon did it'd usual good job in getting the item to be in a timely manner. Again I used the no cost SuperSaver shipping. Once again good job.",1350604800,,1667,4.4411764705882355

1967904,3,B000127LW2,"Star Trek Voyager was the first Star Trek franchise I never bothered to finish. I even watched all 4 seasons of Enterprise on Netflix. However, Voyager just never rose beyond a mediocrity. The whole premise was that the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from home, but we never actually see any implications of this. There is almost no tension amongst the crew, no divisions, no infighting. Starfleet discipline is maintained even when it doesn't make sense. Very few families or deep relationships forming, something absolutely impossible in such close quarters. The show could have gone off in an interesting direction, but instead became a more action-oriented Next Generation.

Given that the producers decided to take the show in an episodic rather than serial format, the show needed something other than the plotline to make it interesting. However, the crew is for the most part an utterly boring bunch. Katherine Janeway is fine as the ship's captain, emanating a motherly concern for the crew, but can't hold a candle to Captains Picard or Sisko. The holographic doctor is ironically the most interesting and entertaining character. He provides much-needed humor. However, the rest of the crew shows little to no character development. They're usually relegated to restating the obvious.

Voyager was partly a victim of more cynical viewer attitudes in the late 1990s and the rise of reality TV. However, Voyager also failed on its own grounds. Coming after TNG and DS9, Voyager needed to more than just another Star Trek.",1346284800,,1543,5.119047619047619
1967905,4,B000127LW2,"When Voyager first hit the airways I was not impressed.  TO be honest, Janeway was the reason why.  She was extremely stiff and inflexible in the first season; even more than Picard in TNG.  But I was so head-in-clouds over Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 that I acknowledged not really giving the show a fair chance.  So I decided to watch it from the beginning.  And I will write high level reviews for each season, not each episode.

Season 1's focus is the crew getting adjusted to life in the Delta Quadrant as well as the merging of Maquis and Starfleet members into a cohesive crew.  This struggle makes for some good writing early on as you would definitely expect some conflicts, but there were some missed opportunities for sabotage.  Episodes like ""State of Flux"" which sets the foundation for one of the most interesting backstories in Voyager (Seska) and ""Learning Curve"" where they showcase some stragglers that just didn't make the full transition to Starfleet life.  The most obvious negative is that they never fully explored the latter; after a while, people just start flowing along happily, which given the story of the Maquis told in Deep Space Nine, should really been more challenging.

There were some head scratcher episodes, such as ""Time and Again"" where it causes a headache thinking about what's going on (which is the reason it's generally not a good idea to tell a time travel-related story), and you can't help but think back to TNG's ""Time's Arrow"" where Data experiences generally the same idea; that you can encounter an event today that both hasn't and has happened.  Trust me when I say that the episode does make sense, but it will give you some migraines trying to sort through the chronology of everything.  Even worse is the idea that Janeway can affect the flow of time by realizing the paradox, thus preventing the event that caused them to be in the situation in the first place (thus creating another paradox).

Other episodes, like ""Emanations"" are filler and do little to further the series.  Annoyances that are better left out of the canon, but we're stuck with nonetheless.  ""Prime Factors"" is actually a well-told story marred by poor character interactions and illogical behavior (Tuvok).

It's clear from the episode progression that the writers were trying to use this opportunity to work with characters and storylines that they could not have in the other Star Trek versions.  Being in the Delta Quadrant meant they could make up characters at a whim, and throwing the Maquis in there gave them ""bad guys"" without much effort.  The problem is that the approach is so haphazard that it will be difficult to really be interested in seeing more seasons, but the first season is necessary to really enjoy some of what comes later.",1345939200,,2780,4.816842105263158

Putting aside any bias, objectively this is some of the weakest acting and writing in Voyager. It's an episode that is supposed to elicit heart ache and emotion for victims of a tragic war. It fails to accomplish both of these goals because it's not relate-able and never earns what it trys to evoke with it's sub par script.

Janeway seemed a bit stiff and plain in the first few episodes, but now I see that the writers have much more planned for her.

It was caused by photonic beings that were inadvertently captured by Voyager's crew and studied, and in retaliation the photonic ""being"" transmitted into the holodeck and kidnapped the crew that came into contact with ""grendel"" the monster that was to be slayed by Beowulf aka Ensign Kim.

This episode broke new ground with the transfer of the Hologram Doctor into the Holodeck to rescue his crew members, since he can choose to be energy or matter, the ""grendel"" can't harm him, or so he thought.  Looks like the Doctor got more than he bargained for!  Can he ultimately defeat this ""being"" himself?

Unethical and unprofessional relationships between superior officers and their subordinates is just asking for trouble and that's why armed forces in the present day tend to legally discourage such problematic relationships.",1334361600,,605,5.111111111111111

1967927,4,B000127LW2,"If you're reading this, you probably already know what Voyager is all about, and whether or not you like it. Season 1, as with first seasons of most TV shows, finds the producers, writers and cast seeking their footing with the concept and the characters. Thus, it's one of the weaker seasons of the series. I'm OK with that -- they had to start somewhere. Four stars for the content.

I take issue with the price. This season aired 17 years ago. It's only 15 episodes (all subsequent seasons featured 26 episodes, I think) on five DVDs. Why is it currently priced at more than $51 (a figure that randomly jumps to more than $60)? That's more than $3.40 per episode at the current price.

In addition, the DVD packaging of the Voyager series is disgraceful and insulting to the legacy of the series. It's packaged as if the product was meant to be temporary and disposable, which makes the pricing even more frustrating and unfathomable.

One would think that the first season would be most likely of all the seasons to be ""value"" priced in order to hook consumers into starting -- and continuing -- a collection of the complete series. Sadly, not the case here. A frustrating side-effect of this greedy pricing model is that Voyager box sets are one of the most bootlegged DVD sets you can find. Just try to buy new or used, supposedly legit copies on auction sites and you'll see what I mean. You'll probably spend about $20-$35, but there's no telling what you'll get for your money. If the price was reasonable for the official product, maybe there would be less of a market for bootlegs.

I own the DVDs of Voyager, and I think they look spectacular. The streaming picture is just OK. It's a bit fuzzy looking, and suffers from the common streaming problem of having movements that sometimes look sluggish. When Amazon first announced the complete Voyager and DS9 series would be available on Prime, I wondered if I should sell my DVD copies while there is still a market for them. After watching a couple of the shows stream, I'm keeping the DVDs.

This particular pilot was a very unusual start to a Star Trek series. It has two ships being drawn to a VERY remote point of the galaxy, and then suffering calamities that kill many of both crews. The remaining crew of each ship, nominal enemies, must combine and find a way to live and work together if they wish to have a chance to survive and find a way home.

As for the show itself, I fully agree with all the highest star ratings. I was a dedicated fan when it was on the air and watched any reruns as they aired as well. But, I'm a believer in keeping up with technology especially when its so obviously available. And in my opinion it sucks to open the crap packaging, insert the first disc only to realize I paid good money for an aspect ratio that is antiquated beyond current memory. I haven't had a 1.33:1 aspect (square) screen TV in over 15 years and own no DVD's that aren't widescreen. For all the technical wowzer that any Star Trek production is, or should be, I find it hard to believe it is only available in stone age format. Yet, the original series with Kirk and Co. is available in BluRay. In my opinion, if you are considering the start of a Star Trek collection, begin with the original series in BluRay and wait on all the others that followed 20-30+ years later to catch up. Talk about an inversely proportional universe. Maybe this is Gene Roddenberry's idea of a joke. I understand converting standard DVD to BluRay is time and resource intensive but at least we could have a widescreen version.

And this applies to US issues of these DVD sets. Amazon UK sells Voyager sets for under $20; even with shipping, that's a fraction of the cost here. True, there were a few episodes that were really, really dreadful. (Think Janeway & Tom Paris turning into giant lizards and mating. I kid you not.) But on the whole, this series depicted a hardy band of space refugees far from home, just trying to make it day by day as they trekked laboriously from one end of the galaxy to the other. This really is Star TREK. That's what made Voyager such a refreshing change from the normal & sometimes boring milleu of Klingons & Cardassians & Romulans & Vulcans & and Federation political correctness & such. With Voyager, pretty much anything was possible. The crew was admittedly plain vanilla for the most part, but they got the job done. Two characters in particular have to be near the top of anyone's Trek list--the Doctor & Seven of Nine (after season 3). Those two, just brilliant creations. If you've never dipped into Voyager, try to rent Season 1 or stream it. Or do like I did, and patiently wait for a reasonable price. It does happen.",1324944000,2,1362,4.586065573770492

1967952,4,B000127LW2,"As a die-hard Trek fan, I watched the entire 7 seasons of Voyager when it originally aired.  At the time, I was a bit disappointed in the show.  It seemed like a bit of a Next Gen retread, and some of the characters were annoying (like Neelix, who was Trek's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks).  I also grew weary of the constant techno-babble and the way every crew member seemed to be totally proficient in PHD level astro-physics.

Anyway, I bought the DVD set mostly because I got a great deal on it at Walmart, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was in 2011.  All the stuff that annoyed me before didn't seem so bad now that the show has some distance from its predecessors.  It was also refreshing to see a show which aimed high from a moral standpoint and openly defended their principles no matter what the cost.  Most of the recent sci-fi shows are far more complex and ambiguous in that respect, so it's nice to see a command crew that isn't saddled with all kinds of personal demons and conflicting agendas.

I also liked Kate Mulgrew a lot more this time around.  Where I found her abrasive before I now see her as bold and decisive.  And one of the coolest things about this set is the bonus disc that contains footage of the original actress (Catherine Bujold) who was tapped to play Janeway.  I remember reading about her back when this aired.  They said she couldn't handle the rigors of filming a weekly TV show, and quit after only one week of shooting. But after watching the videos of her, it's clear that she was let go because she wasn't suited to the part at all, and Kate Mulgrew is brilliant by comparison.

One knock on this set is the video quality, which is not great by today's high-def standards.  Like STNG and DS9, it was shot on film but the final edits were done on video tape.  So the final ""masters"" are of inferior quality, and the only way to fix it is to go back and rebuild the special effects + live action compilation from scratch using modern technology.  From what I've read, there's no plan to do that (not surprising, as Paramount is always dragging its feet and Voyager wasn't that popular to begin with). So odds are, this set is as good as it will get anytime soon.

As others have pointed out, the packaging is a bit on the flimsy side, but it's not as bad as some reviewers have suggested.  As long as it's handled carefully, the box and colored panels hold up well enough and the whole thing looks really cool in the box.

So all in all, I'd give this a thumbs up.  The price has come down to a reasonable amount, and the bonus disc has a bunch of cool interviews with the producers, along with the original Janeway footage mentioned above.  Unfortuately, this set is new very hard to find out in retail world.  Music & video stores are on the decline in general, and the only big-box retailed I know of who carried Voyager was Walmart (and they dropped it from their inventory last year).  So at this point, it's pretty much Amazon or Ebay if you want to buy this set new.  And if you get it from Amazon, at least you'll know that you can easily exchange it if you do happen to receive a damaged box.  I'd get it while you can - this probably is out of print and whatever copies are left are all there will be for quite some time.",1296000000,2,3286,4.312703583061889

1967958,2,B000127LW2,"Please note: my two-star review is with regard to the overall DVD experience. I recently purchased season one of Star Trek: Voyager, and almost immediately upon opening the set to view when getting home, I realized (again) why I waited so long to start collecting any of the Star Trek series on DVD.

For starters, I remember very vividly the days in 2002, 2003 when television series -- both old and new -- were popping out season sets on DVD for roughly $40.00 to $50.00 per season. At the time, that seemed to be the reasonable standard. Paramount in it's infinite wisdom (or would that be greed?) managed to find a way to charge upwards of $150.00 per season for any of the Star Trek sets. And, much as I love Star Trek, I certainly wasn't about to spend that kind of money on any of these sets, and Voyager is the embodiment of that reasoning.

The obvious jugular to go for in this case would be the packaging. It's downright atrocious. Flimsy, gaudy, and cheap. Season One is packaged in two, transparent slip cases which are really just ONE slip case that has been halved in the middle. Removing these pieces reveals the translucent, electric orange DVD jewel-case ""book"" for the five discs. ""Book"" being entirely facetious because upon closer inspection the only thing binding these orange ""pages"" together is a piece of transparent packaging tape.

The discs themselves are poorly labeled. Where in all previous releases for TOS, TNG and DS9, there were actual labels on the discs and sometimes even episode listings, the Voyager discs instead have the show logo printed and little else. What else there*is* on the disc is printed in so minuscule a font, it might as well not even be there.

The first season, consisting of the first sixteen hours of the series (the two-hour pilot telefilm plus fourteen regular episodes) are presented in airdate order (to the best of my recollection). At first the episodes look terrible but I attribute that more to being spoiled by the clarity and wonderful-ness of Blu-Ray on HD televisions. The visual effects still look great and once they finally settled on a hairdo for Janeway, most of the distracting visual elements cease to be distracting.

In terms of storytelling and overall quality, I've found that your mileage will vary. Not strictly from episode to episode alone but on the whole. Until reviewing the series on DVD this week, I'd not actually seen most of these episodes in maybe nine or ten years. I fondly recalled ""Caretaker"" being a very good first show and that the first year itself had been quite strong and well written. Perhaps it's the passage of time, perhaps my storytelling sensibilities have changed in the intervening years, but the shows didn't seem to 'pop' as much as they once had. Standouts like ""Heroes & Demons,"" ""State of Flux,"" and ""Jetrel"" are anchored down by the mostly mediocre efforts like ""Emanations"" and ""Learning Curve.""

The special features are nice, and there are a few ""hidden"" Easter Egg features as well that are really just minute-long blurbs from various cast and crew members recollecting about some tidbit of trivia from the show's production. A nice touch that could have (and some say SHOULD have) been included --and one that would perhaps justify the hefty pricetag-- would be to include the previous series' introductory episodes to the Maquis conflict -- TNG's ""Journey's End"" and ""Preemptive Strike"" along with DS9's ""The Maquis"" two-parter. Sadly, there's nothing like that on this set.

So in conclusion, while some of the stories have aged rather well given how timely and topical they were in the '90s, some have not. And while some of the special features clearly had some forethought and effort expended in to producing them, the physical packaging of this DVD set clearly did not. Overall, I find this set is most certainly not worth some of the more extreme price tags that come attached to it. If you simply must have it, try to find the set for under $20.00.",1281744000,3,3982,4.812865497076023

1967962,4,B000127LW2,"I'll admit that I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but there's something about the mix of characters and the premise of trying to get home that draws me to Voyager.  Yes, it's a bit campy and predictable at times, with a moral compass that's just a bit too straight--with way too much exposition, which has become a trait of the Star Trek franchise--but that's what makes for good escapist television.  And Season One delivers on that promise of good television, with some interesting extras on the DVD set.  Unfortunately, the season isn't long enough to justify such an expensive price; the 5 extras also do not make up for a lack of shows in the shortened first season.  (The price for all the Star Trek shows, as well as X-Files, makes me wonder if there's some sort of attack on sci-fi fans, whom studio executives think will pay through the nose to get the DVDs.)

1967964,2,B000127LW2,"Bashing Voyager is pretty much the national pastime as far as Trek is concerned.  People warned me away from this show for years.  My thinking was ""how bad could it be?  It was on the air for seven seasons without getting cancelled.""  After seeing this season, my question is ""Why didn't it get cancelled?  The writing is some of the worst I've ever seen in my life.  It was almost like they were trying to write a bad plot in every episode.  I don't like too many of the characters that much, except for the Doctor.  Janeway is a worse captain than the Enterprise-B captain from Generations.

 Okay, let me start at the beginning.  The new U.S.S. Voyager and a Maquis ship get caught in some kind of nexus-like thing and are transported to the delta quadrant.  They find some guy called the caretaker who transports ships to himself....for some reason.  They find the Caretaker and have the opportunity to use his technology to get back home, but no.  Janeway says they have to destroy the array because they have to keep it from being used by the Kazon.  Which, without question, goes against the prime directive.  You know, that federation law, which says we aren't allowed to interfere in other cultures?  Janeway says that ""We're already involved"" and blows the array to bits.  If she absolutely had to destroy the array, why didn't she stay behind and do it herself?  Or make a fuse or something.  But no, Janeway did what she does best.  She took a situation with a fairly obvious solution and instead of going with that solution, she followed the solution that was the most idiotic.  She continues to do that throughout the season.  I'm not a big fan of the thing with Voyager being stranded far from home.  I don't see why this is any different from TOS or TNG where they're out exploring the unknown.  They're doing the exact same thing here, except they are also trying to find a way to get home.  This is supposed to make the series new and exciting, but to me it just made it worse.  Because we're going to have all these ""will voyager make it home"" episodes.  And since it isn't the series finale, we know they aren't going to make it home.  Not yet, anyway.  In a way, this almost makes the series depressing, because we know these morons are going to have to spend the next seven years with each other.

 Along those lines, let me talk about the characters.  As I said earlier, I love the Doctor.  Picardo steals every scene he is in, with his horrible bedside manner and his sarcasm.  But other than him, there's almost no character I like.  There were some characters I thought were okay.  Kes is supposed to be this sweet, likeable character that everyone likes.  And she is, except when she's annoying about it.  She cares about the doctor, and wants to make him as comfortable as possible.  Why?  He's a hologram, nothing more.  He's not someone who needs to be comforted or cuddled.  Kes is sweet, yes, but moronically so.  Tuvok was okay, I guess.  He's really nothing more than your standard Vulcan.  There really isn't anything about him that makes him any different than Spock.  Except that he's a lot less interesting than Spock.  It was like they had to come up with an idea for a new character, and they were tired so they said ""Why don't we just throw a Vulcan into the mix?  We haven't had a Vulcan in the last two shows.""  The thing is, I think most Vulcans are kind of bland.  All they do is repeat ""logic"" and ""no emotion"".  What made Spock so interesting was the fact that he is half-human, and strives to constantly keep his human side in check.  But other than him, I don't find most Vulcans very interesting.  And Tuvok is no exception.  Torres is okay, but why is it that almost every Trek series has to have a crew member of a mixed race?  It's been done before.  Except now we get a half-human, half-klingon chick.  She has to struggle to keep her klingon side in check, blah blah blah........like I said, we've seen this before.  It's already been done, and done better.  The last character I didn't hate is Chakotay.  He isn't a great character, to say the least.  And he seems to have a crush on Janeway, since he goes along with every retarded plan she comes up with.  But I found his character to be somewhat interesting.  Although sometimes they get a little bit racist with his animal guide stuff.

 I hate Harry Kim and Tom Paris.  I thought Tom's background was kind of interesting, but he is by far the worst actor on this show.  And that's saying something.  Whenever he delivers a well-written line (which isn't often given the writing) it backfires because the guy simply cannot act.  He's horrible.  The guy who plays Harry Kim is not much better, but the problems I have with his character are more the writing than the bad performance.  Harry Kim is the nerd that you knew in high school who always got stuffed in a locker by the jocks.  He's the butt of every joke, and I wish they would just kill him off already and put him out of his misery.  But the two worst characters in this show by far are Janeway and Neelix.  The sad thing is, neither one of these actors are bad.  Both of them are decent actors.  But their characters are written so badly.  Let's start with Neelix.  Neelix is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks and Wesley Crusher combined.  He weasel's his way onto the ship first as a guide, and then as morale officer.  He imposes his authority over everyone, including Janeway.  And you want to know the most infuriating part of all this?  Everyone goes along with it!!  The only one who ever takes a stand against this jerk is Seska, and she's evil.  And since she also hates Janeway for getting them lost in the first place....I might be in love with her.  Along those lines, Janeway is a horrible captain.  She faces any problem, big or small, and does the following.  She searches for the most destructive, painful solution that will probably be the most destructive and cause the biggest loss of life.  And she always has to go out of her way to get all these worthless people onto the ship.  Like when she got Tom Paris out of the penal colony to come with them on the mission, for absolutely no reason.  And why does she integrate the Maquis into the Voyager crew?  Why not do what any sensible captain would do and throw them in the brig?  She puts Chakotay, a renegade, in the first officer position, rather than Tuvok, who has had starfleet training and is the second officer.

 Another problem this show has is the lack of effective villians.  The two groups of villians are the Kazon and the Viidians.  The Kazon are a joke.  They are complete and utter morons.  The Viidians are kind of interesting, because they're not necessarily bad.  They're just doing what they have to to survive.  But just like the Kazon, they are not very smart.  The only villian I liked was Seska.  The reason she is so effective is because she's so smart.  Or it could be that she looks smart when compared to the Kazon and the Viidians.  Voyager is a bad show, because both the writing and the characters are horrible.  How this crap ran for seven seasons is beyond me.  But I've said all that to say this:  I actually found myself enjoying this show.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen, but for some reason I like it.  A lot of the episodes had crappy storylines, but only because they didn't make good use of what they had.  They would have an interesting idea, and then dump bad writing or cliches on top of that.  This was not a good season, but it was at least better than season one of TNG.  Man, that season was the textbook definition of bad Science Fiction.  And TNG eventually did develop into a very good series.  Maybe I'll find the later seasons of Voyager enjoyable too.",1271808000,5,7758,4.452211126961483

The show starts out with a lot of promise, and there is better to come.  However, I think the last couple of episodes are a let-down.  The season definitely ended with a whimper.

There were several good episodes, but overall the show does not have the strength that it will in later seasons.  Chiefly among my complaints is that the 2-hour opener is badly paced in some places and some of the plots seem recycled or very generic.  For a show that is supposed to be about being alone with a potentially hostile crew, many of the episodes seemed like they forgot that.

What really saves the show is two things.  First, the Holographic Doctor (Robert Picardo) is great.  Second, the show does have a good cast and they really do gel together well.  The first season lays the foundation for things to come, and I have to say that the cast was very good through-out the seven year run.

1967977,1,B000127LW2,"I tried to give this a chance, but it was hard right off the bat with Janeway's ""I prefer to be called 'Captain'"". I guess she's just too special to follow the standard all the rest of Starfleet goes by. This just started her off in an unfavorable light and as my least favorite captain of all the series.

What broke the camel's back, however, was the episode in which she berates the crew for trading stories in order to get the tech to get home nearly instantly (granted it did not work). Consider that half the crew were in revolt against Starfleet. Now consider that the captain of the ship they are on refuses to let them get home because she feels trading tecj for stories violates the Prime Directive (the most over used and abused theme in all of Trek). Mutanies have happened over less on ships on which the entire crew was all aligned with the captain at the ofset. Yet the crew of Voyager say, ""Oh, OK"" and leave it at that. Sorry, but there would have been a full fledged revolt had something like that happened.

Though a great fan of DS9, ST:Voyager had a compelling storyline with a twist, a female captain, Katherine Janeway . This concept broke the old Star Trek mold by proving that a woman can be as ""cowboy"" as Jim Kirk, as ""eloquent"" as Jean-Luc Picard, and as ""unyielding"" as Benjamin Sisco. Season One lands the crew of the Intrepid-Class explorer Starship in the depths of the Delta Quadrant after an encounter with a space anomaly while chasing down the Maquis. This season is mostly about the integration and initial difficulties  that a ship built for only 6 month deployments has to face over 75 years from home.

Set in the same timeframe as TNG and DS9 the Starship Voyager is sent into the far away Delta Quadrant and,after an act of kindness Captain Kathryn Janeway and her crew are stranded-trying to explore totally unknown worlds and find their way home along the way. This DVD set marks the beginning of those adventures;finding the two different crews on the ship learning to adapt to eachother. The characters on this show are extremely well developed;gelling faster then on any Trek series before or after it. This season is also home to some absolutely terrific episods-the pilot 'Caretaker' being among them. Other corkers include ""Time And Again"",""Heroes And Deamons"" and my favorite ""Jetrel"". Voyager in it's pre-Jeri Ryan/Seven Of Nine period had one of the greatest ensamble casts in all of Star Trek and because the theme of this show was for all intents and purposes surviving and being triumphant in a difficult situation. Before purchasing these DVD's I had of course seen all these episodes many times both on TV and old VHS tapes recorded from the TV. But seeing these together in such a concentrated way really brings to mind what a terribly underrated Star Trek series this was and how it has all too often been seen as among Star Trek's more compromised efforts.

1967991,3,B000127LW2,"First, like several other reviews, I am docking this set a star because of the price.  I own a great number of television series on DVD.  This is not one of them.  Nor do I own any of the other Star Trek franchises.  I've never even considered buying them.  While virtually every other show that has ever appeared on DVD is available at a reasonable price (though there are other exceptions, in particular classic BBC series like Monty Python and The Prisoner), the Star Trek series are only available at exorbitant and prohibitive prices.  My only guess is that they assume (and perhaps correctly?) that there are enough Trekkies out there who will allow themselves to be willingly robbed of their hard earned money.  But none of these sets should be priced on Amazon above $40.  There is, for instance, almost no expenses to be paid for rights to music, one of the reasons for the high cost of other sets (and why ALLY MCBEAL still isn't available, since most of its music can't be substituted for less expensive songs).  These should be cheap!  Instead they are just about the most expensive DVDs out there.

Although the Star Trek series were set far in the future, narratively each series in the franchise was actually quite conservative and devoid of innovation.  I suspect they made the deliberate decision to be conservative so as to make the futuristic setting less opaque.  But even though the eighties saw tremendous advances and innovation in narrative, moving more and more from an episodic, stand alone format to a serial, ongoing story arc format, Star Trek in general hewed to the stand-alone format.  So despite the great casts and despite the often-brilliant writing, there simply isn't much in the way of overall narrative.  There is also as a result relatively little in the way of character development.  While I enjoy THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE 9, and VOYAGER, I always wonder how things would have turned out if the producers had decided to follow the example of shows like HILL STREET BLUES, CHINA BEACH, L.A. LAW, and ST. ELSEWHERE (all shows that predated these three Star Trek vehicles) and attempted a serial rather than episode format.  I think we might have seen something rather magnificent.  Instead, we would have to wait for BABYLON 5, FARSCAPE, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (created by Star Trek alum Ron Moore) to see just what could be done with serial narrative in a SF context.

The tragedy with VOYAGER is that few series in the history of TV would have seemed to need a serial format more.  The parallel would be with the original 1978 version of BSG, which also seemed to require a serial format but also didn't get it.  Instead of the series being about their attempt to get home from the other side of creation, the need to get home merely provided the backdrop.  It should have been a narrative feature to drive the entire series forward.  Instead, it was just there.  Anyone viewing either FARSCAPE or the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can't help but notice how much better both of those series are in large part because they each honored that central idea of trying to go home.

I also have a couple of very personal bones to pick with VOYAGER as I do with all of the Star Trek series.  I absolutely detest shows with aliens.  I hate shows that use science as a form of magic.  I simply find ornate, speculative scientific solutions to problems to be narratively unexciting.  They almost always remove us from the characters and, well, bore me.  Finally, I hate innovations like ""shields.""  To me personally there is no more loathsome sentence in any SF series than something along the lines of, ""Shields down to 60%!""  As much as I love FARSCAPE, I detested the day when Moya got her own energy shield.  And although I'm not a huge fan of BABYLON 5, I love that they never stooped to using shields.  And BATTLESTAR GALACTICA demonstrates how much more exciting a SF series can be when a spaceship just has to eat a big bomb.  And don't get me started on phasers and lasers and photon torpedoes!

Despite all this, VOYAGER is frequently a very interesting series.  Like most of the Star Trek series, the show has a great cast.  I really like Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway.  Interestingly, she was the second Star Trek captain to take her role after the French Canadian originally intended for the part declined to participate.  The first was Patrick Stewart, who because Picard after Louis Jourdan did not.  In this case, Mulgrew took over for Genevieve Bujold, who quit at the very beginning of the production.  I like the presence and command that Mulgrew brings to the show.  Plus, she has really great hair.  I like Tim Russ as Tuvok.  And most of the rest of the cast is also first rate, but for me personally the best character on the show -- and the only one that really brings anything new to the table -- is Robert Picardo's The Doctor.  On TNG Data had become TV's first truly great android character, providing many wonderful reflections on what it means to be a person.  But Voyager's Emergency Holographic Doctor did not even possess in any conventional sense a body.  Although I almost universally hate aliens on SF shows, I harbor a great love for any kind of so-called artificial life forms, whether we style them as robots, androids, or cyborgs.  (Any short list of my favorite SF characters would include Data, The Doctor, Seven of Nine, Max Guevera, River Tam, Kyle, and Sharon Agathon.)  VOYAGER would later introduce an equally compelling character along these lines in the marvelous Seven of Nine, someone who biologically is human but whose mind is still that of a hive.

All in all I enjoy VOYAGER, though it is the source of much frustration for me.  Aliens, shields, stand alone episodes.  All of this impedes the enjoyment for me.  Still, despite this I find much to like.  But I would strongly recommend anyone wanting to see this to rent it from Netflix.  It isn't merely criminal for Paramount to offer these discs at such immoral prices; anyone buying the discs at these outrageous prices are colluding with them.",1199232000,,6089,4.708609271523179

But, I don't know, I always thought it was a pretty good show, though I often skipped it when it was on the air due to my hatred of frequent commercials.  Even this first season, when (like most ""Trek"" shows) it was still finding its footing, ""Voyager"" was pretty entertaining.  Heck, right out of the box, Jerry Goldsmith's theme alone was gold.

And, like all TV on DVD, don't underestimate the ""commercial-less"" effect: while a truly bad episode of something will always be a truly bad episode, episodes of ""Voyager"" I remember as being mediocre when they were first broadcast now flow better and entertain better now that all the dumb commercials have been removed.  So, episodes I rated in the past as two-star quality now feel like three-star episodes; episodes I remember as rating three-stars before now often feel like three-and-a-half or even four star shows, etc.  It's amazing.

See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a market fair price of $25-35.  So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range.  So, $60 is your sweet spot.

You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop.

1968005,5,B000127LW2,"Star Trek Voyager is easily one of the finest ST series ever made. In between the end of the Next Generation and in the middle of Deep Space Nine, Rick Berman and company decided to go for another series.

They really didn't know what they wanted initially other than they wanted to make it different than the other ST series (this on the Special Features on Disc 5). However borrowing on the environment of the Next Generation they decided to make another program based on the experience of a crew aboard a starship. The major plot of the show is that they were trying to get back home after being pushed several thousands of light years away.

The DVD box set by Paramount is simply superb!!! They did NOT dropped the ball on anything at all. The case is wonderfully animated with the picture of the ship.  The case is very small and compact. The DVD's look like they were restored and the Special Features on the disc are enough to keep any Trekkie happy.

Of course my favorites episode would be ""Caretaker"" , ""Phage"" which introduces the organ stealing Vidiians, ""Ex Post Facto"" which had a slice of a murder mystery feeling to it, ""Heroes and Demons"", and ""Cathexis"" to name a few.

The chemistry between the actors was great and everyone seems to have a favorite mine was Jenway , Tom Paris, and B'Elanna. Examining the stories too they ain't just about aliens like another good Star Trek show there are moral and ethical dilemmas that are presented.

Most people who don't buy the DVD set won't realize that Kate Mulgrew was actually not the first choice to be the Captain it was a French actress named Bujold. Bujold was a fine actress but really too old for the part and she has no energy whatsoever.

The Special Features go into detail including a feature on Kate's preparation for the role by studying Patrick Stewart's performing of Luc Picard in the TNG.

If you watch the second season it really brings the first season down cause they over use the kazon which are one of the dumbest aliens ever to appear on star trek.  after seeing the kazon one suddenly finds science fiction boring. The reason the first season survives the kazon being so dumb is because they are only in two episodes.

the vidians are ok and better than most people give them credit for but the writers never took full advantage of them.  body harvesting aliens could have been way more interesting than the borg if used properly.  they only used the videans in two episodes as well the one where they captured a few of the crew being the better episode.  they used a lot of episodes using the temporal mechanics theme wich are usually pretty interesting episodes.  the episode where the captin and pilot go back in time on the one alien planet is pretty good but the ending where the planet gets destroyed because the crew was trying to save their people which is what brought them to the planet after all was an obvious example of the writers having no idea what was going on with the show and just making up any ending they think sounds good.

another one of the shows highligts is the crew moron neelix.  whenever the writers run out of ideas they use neelixs bad cooking as a plot.  they also portrayed the captain as the crews mother figure.  this was a dumb idea too.  if your on a star ship thats similar to a ship in the military the captain isn't a mother figure.  however the show could have been more interesting useing that theme if the crew would have been more rebelious just like any bad kid and which they could have done since a quarter of the crew were supposed to be rebbel maquis.  the packaging was poor and the season was too short to be above 60 bucks but besides that it was pretty entertaining.",1133049600,2,1982,4.421487603305785

1968014,4,B000127LW2,"Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...

Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...

The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Caretaker"" in which the Federation starship USS Voyager, led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway, is unexpectedly transported 70,000 light years away while pursuing a band of Maquis rebels through an area known as the badlands. The Voyager's new destination is the Delta Quadrant, an uncharted region of the galaxy overseen by the Caretaker and threatened by the colonial aggression of the Kazon... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Cloud"" in which the Voyager accidentally injures an alien life form while searching for an ingredient to boost its energy supply, and ""Learning Curve"" in which members of Commander Chakotay's ragtag Maquis crew are given a Starfleet Academy tutorial on how to act properly aboard the Voyager...

1968015,4,B000127LW2,"Voyager was really an excellent series from the start.

With a superb teaser, great casting and a wonderful premise for a series, the series starts as Voyager and a Marquis ship are propelled half-way across the galaxy by an unknown force.

Forced to destroy the technology responsible for causing the ship to be brought there, so begins the series as Voyager sets off home for Earth with a 70 year journey ahead of her.

The joining of the Starfleet and Marquis crews together make for some interesting stories and early tension, particuarly in this early series.

The crew is also joined by an alien, a talaxian known as "" Neelix"" who takes great delight in giving the Vulcan Security office "" Tuvok"" a hard time. Their interaction is reminiscent of Bones and Spock from the original series.

Neelix has a partner an Ocampan female called "" Kes "" a species that only lives for 9 years.

The Captain, "" Janeway"" the first female lead in all the Star Trek series, is another great cast. She is very strong, but also very fair with her desicions. She decides to make the head of the Marquis, an ex Starfleet Officer her first Officer. His name is Chakotay. He is an Indian, and makes a very interesting character in the coming seasons. He is very softy spoken, but has real prescence.

Another interesting addition is an ex convict, ex Starfleet, ex Marquis, who becomes the conn officer. Tom Paris as he's known, is an excellent pilot, who finds it hard to initially be part of the team.

Rounding out the senior crew and main characters is a fresh Ensign, Harry Kim, just out of Starfleet, a half Klingon female ( who hates her Klingon part ! )she's an ex Marquis, who becomes the chief Engineer, and finally a Holographic doctor, known only as "" The Doctor"" who is activated as the ships real Doctor was killed in the first episode.

The hologram was initially only intended as an Emergency to supplement the normal crew, or in the real Doctors absense.

His struggle with finding an identity is one of the real high lights of the show, in the vein of "" Data"" from the next Generation.

The opportunities for story lines from all this lot are almost endless!

Although a short season ( Just 16 episodes )there is barely a bad episode. "" Learning Curve"" probably just takes the cake for this being ever so corny, and a somewhat disappointing end to the first season.

The number of excellent quality episodes is amazing.

"" Caretaker"" the opening was an excellent start to the series, which sets up the ship, crew and location for the new and old veiwer of Star Trek alike.

"" Eye of the Needle"" was a great story about finding a small wormhole that offered hope to the crew for finding a way home.

"" Ex Post Facto"" was interesting story, with a legal twist as the conn officer Tom Paris is punished for an alleged murder on a planet.

"" Prime Factors"" also pushed the ethical side of the crew as they debate whether to violate their prime directive of not interfering with another species development or to abuse the  trust and respect provided by another species.

"" Jetrel"" is the first "" Neelix"" episode with bite, as he faces the creator of a weapon that destroyed much of his race, including his family.

All in all, this is a superb series, and worth watching from the start. Having just watched them all again recently, you really appreciate the character development, and the continuity the show manages to portray.

A worth while additon, with added bonus features, make this well worth it!

1968017,3,B000127LW2,"Early seasons of Star Trek Voyager are a bit bland and uneven.  Everything just feels a little off.  Personally, I don't think Voyager gains its sea-legs until well into the 3rd and 4th seasons.  Having watched all the Star Trek series religiously, I was disappointed in Voyager ... had high hopes for it especially do to them making the captain a woman.  Plus the Voyager crew was the most diverse Star Trek crew there was with the exception of the original trek:  A female captain, a Native American first officer, A Black Vulcan, A half human half klingon bridge officer ... what more could you ask for you say?  How about better dialog and better acting!  It took a while for these folks to fill their roles.

When buying Star Trek DVD's my belief is always that you should buy the whole collection.  Its not complete otherwise ... but don't expect every season to be good.  The gist with TNG, DS9, Voyager and even Enterprise to a lesser extent is that they get better as the seasons progress.  DS9, hands down though, is the best!",1116115200,2,1036,4.545945945945946

Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway was without a doubt the best captain of a Star Trek series.

For those complaining about the packaging? If you hate the packaging so much, why'd you pick it up? You could clearly see what kind of packaging it had before you purchased it. So, you knew what you were getting into before hand. Personally, I think the packaging is very cool.

And for the person who complained about two episodes missing? I only have one question to ask. Why would Paramount include two episodes from the Original Series -- Arena and City On The Edge Of Forever? I don't know about the overseas sets, but those two episodes were not Voyager episodes, so therefore they don't belong on a Voyager set.

1968020,4,B000127LW2,"I think the idea of this series was a good one having the voyager sucked out into the delta quadrant 70,000 light years from earth. It starts out where the voyager is chasing marquise rebels who along with voyager get pulled across the galaxy by the caretaker who is searching for the right species to help take care of a planet it's kind had accidentally cause life on this certain planet to go underground due to unforeseen ecological damage it had caused to the planet. The caretaker is dying and eventually dies leaving voyager trying to figure someway to get back to federation space(it would take decades to do so). The Delta quadrant is full of hostile beings. One of the first is the Kazon. One of voyagers crew( who was one of the rebles at first(Seska)...and unbeknownest to them a disguised cardassian becomes one of the voyager's greatest enemies when she gives the kazon some federation tecnology. She escapes and starts helping the Kazon out including several raids on Voyager. Another enemy in the quadrant are the phageans who steal other races body parts to keep on living due a genectic disorder which deforms many of them called the phage. There are several run ins with them along the way. In all, it was a good idea to do this with this series because it has it's own uniqueness to it with a new series of protagonists and allies.",1107302400,,1351,4.633333333333334

In this series, as part of a spinoff of Deep Space Nine, I suppose, we see the combination of a Starfleet and a Maquis crew.  These two must combine after they get thrown into the Delta Quadrant...70,000 Lightyears from home...70 years from home!

There was the ever rough-edged Tom Paris, who achieved one of the most convincing transformations.  There was the rough edge of B'Elanna Torres.

1968029,4,B000127LW2,"I have been a Star Trek fan for over 30 years, having watched TOS as a kid in the 1960's and 1970's. I eagerly anticipated and enjoyed all the motion picture releases as well as TNG series. I always though the series projected hope and the best aspirations of mankind.

Until now I had never given STV a chance. I recall watching an episode or two on TV, but I didn't like the politically correct idea of a female captain, and I thought the basic premise was idiotic. In retrospect my thinking was the only thing idiotic.

I now find Janeway a very believable leader, and she could probably give ol' James Tiberius a run for his money. The premise, when you stop and think about it, is genius because it's really just TOS and TNG in reverse. Instead of ""going where no man has gone before"", these folks are just trying to get home.

After finishing the first three discs of Season 1 this looks very promising. Many reviewers have indicated Season 1 is weaker (as you might expect) than the following seasons. If that's true I can't wait to buy the rest. My favorite episode so far is ""Heros and Demons"", which was crafted in the very best Trek tradition.

My rating of four stars was due to the packaging, which as many have noted seems somewhat cheap and easily damaged. I would concur the retail price is out of line, but I purchased mine used. Other than that, Paramount keep up the good work! Maybe I'll even give DS9 a try.",1093651200,14,1428,4.3977272727272725
1968030,3,B000127LW2,"I remember gathering with friends in January 1995 to watch the very first episode of the new Star Trek series, Voyager.  Drinking some sort of blue punch, I felt great anticipation about what I would see over the following two hours.  And when those hours were over, I was not disappointed.  Caretaker introduced its viewers to a group of engaging characters in an area of the galaxy previously unexplored by the Federation, and that group had a strong-willed captain and a new mission: to return home.

Honestly, I still don't entirely understand Captain Janeway's choice to protect the Ocampa from their enemies and strand her crew, but this would certainly not be her last odd decision.  I suppose some explanation had to be provided for this series' basic premise.

What followed that first installment were fourteen episodes that dealt with the integration of the Star Fleet and Maquis crews (Parallax, Prime Factors, Learning Curve), introduced the creepy but in some ways sympathetic Vidiians (Phage, Faces), and occasionally teased the inhabitants of Voyager with a quick way back to the Alpha Quadrant (Eye of the Needle, and, again, Prime Factors).

Perhaps the characters have always been the strongest aspect of any Star Trek series, and certainly Voyager spent a great deal of time in its first episodes introducing us to principal cast members.  One standout episode in this regard is Heroes and Demons, which gave the holographic doctor his first chance to leave sickbay; another is Jetrel, which provided Neelix with some sorely needed gravitas amidst all the leola root jokes.

The very best episode on this multi-disc set is State of Flux, which revealed one of the Maquis to be a conniving, Caradassian spy.  Martha Hackett plays this character in earlier episodes with subtlety, as a supposed Bajoran who basically just mills about in the background when she's not second-guessing Janeway's orders.  When Seska's true self is revealed, however, the performance modulates into a kind of gleeful meanness that really works and that will continue to entertain well into Voyager's third season.

The extras provided for this set are superb, particularly the scenes of Genevieve Bujold as Captain Janeway.  At this point, it is really impossible to imagine anyone in the captain's chair but Kate Mulgrew.  Other featurettes focus on Mulgrew and various behind-the-scenes goings-on on the Voyager set in its early days.

The shortened season one got the series off to a solid, if not spectacular, start.  Like all the other Star Trek series excluing the first, it would take a couple of years for this ensemble, as well as their writers and producers, to find their stride.  Here we see Voyager's first, significant steps, which I enjoyed watching so much that for seven seasons I never stopped tuning in.

Trekkers and other sci fi fans who've been prejudiced against the series should give it a try.  You'll be very pleasantly surprised at what you see.  Those of us who have long been Voyager fans know exactly why we love this show: the cast and their characters, braving the unknown with spirit, fun, and real determination.",1090886400,7,3143,5.042553191489362

* It's all but impossible not to compare it to the other Star Trek series.  Voyager is the worst of them all. Deep Space Nine is by far the best!
* Voyager dwells too much on their return home and give it a ""Lost In Space"" feel - corny, stupid, dull and overly dependent on the special effects, i.e. read that as 'weak story'.
* The characters weren't quite 'real' and as they developed the writers put the wrong people in certain situations Ex. Janeway would head missions just like Kirk did, a blatant abuse of protocol.  Sometimes Tuvok (a full Vulcan) would be the most emotional character!  Most of the rest of the cast would move from overwhelming a story to just 'disappearing'.  The ensemble cast element rarely existed and when it did the actors were most likely 'out of character'. For the sake of screen time?
* There were some fine episodes (none that I can think of in Season 1) but even most of my favorites wouldn't make my best of list against Next Generation, DS9 or even some of the Original series!
* Being Star Trek you would expect nothing short of great packaging (consensus says no) but Paramount is just peddling something the fans are so addicted to that they will buy it in droves, no matter the packing or...
* High price for a short season, which is also one of the worst as far as stories go.  It makes Next Generations' season one look brilliant (it wasn't).
* The sad truth is the market was prepared for the onslaught of sales of a so-so series at a very high price with the poorest of packaging and the extreme hard core fans have left everyone else wondering why?  Save your money, watch the reruns.",1086134400,6,1864,4.546268656716418

It also allows for each season to have a completely different and all-encomapassing color.  The simple disc design is classy and effective.  Granted, some good liner notes and inserts would have been nice.  But that is a different issue.
The content of the DVD's is, of course, excellent.  I have been a fan since the show started, and finally being able to watch the episodes whenever I want is wonderful.

1968037,3,B000127LW2,"After collecting TNG series You might be very disappointed when opening Voyager Season package. My first impression was that the box set is incomplete, that something is missing. What you get is 5 DVD's packed in the cheapest, orange and slim disk 5-box  which has nothing from the dignity of the movie. It looks like the set is packed with replacement box. The box envelope is not even made of plastic but from thick plastic foil. There is practically no way to smoothly close the box without fastening also cheaply glued back paper cover. What a shame!  The DVD discs looks like they're copied from the original ones, the top side of the disc has almost no print except small and hard to read white information regarded recorded DVD material. For me personally they remind a clean DVD+R/-R discs ready to be burned. The package is designed so badly, that there is no way to avoid fingerprints on the first disc surface when taking out any discs just because this one is not covered with anything! Inserting the disc is also difficult, the center disc holder is so tight that you get the feeling about possible disc damage. Personally I suggest to secure all discs using another package. With original ST-V package your discs will become dirty and even might become damaged in case of accidental squeeze. I give ""0"" (zero) stars for packaging.
But things become even worse because in US version of season 1 there are 2 episodes missing: ""Arena"" and ""The City On The Edge Of Forever"". These two episodes are included in European version of Voyager, isn't it interesting ? Anyway having multiregion dvd-player consider purchase further Voyager Seasons released in Europe. You will get a nice package and as I see more episodes to enjoy. Anyway this is what I'm going to do.
The overall 3 stars note comes from the fact that the movie and sound transfer is very good and it deserves 5 stars. Comparing to the older TNG series a picture is much more sharp and clear. For the first time since TNG, I was able to watch ST Voyager on my 105"" wall projector with no prejudice. But why someone in Paramount decided to release this fantastic series in so shameless box ?

Having never seen any episode of Voyager until the release of Voyager Season One on this DVD package, I am pleased to say I'm quite satisfied with Voyager and its concept of the two diverse crews being thrown together under the same problem of being stuck 70,000 light years from the Alpha Quadrant and home.
I have to agree with others that called Voyager's pilot episode (caretaker) one of the best ever for a Star Trek series. The original Star Trek series opened in 1966 with Episode #2 (Where No Man Has Gone Before) and didn't show the pilot until the middle of the second season, as a two-part show called ""The Cage"". (unnoticed until years later was the mistake made in the original series opening episode where James T. Kirk's name was shown briefly as James R. Kirk on a headstone).
Being a person that grew up during America's first flights into space, during the 1960s, the original Star Trek was perfectly timed to exploit my vast and intense interest in space and space travel. With the introduction of STNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) I once again was in hog heaven as Science Fiction is something I enjoy very much. The Star Trek series of shows, rather that be the original, STNG, DS9, or Voyager offers more than just good Sc-Fi, but good Science Hope that we as a planet survive the next 3 or 4 hundred years.
I found that the first season of Star Trek: Voyager is as good as either Star Trek (the original series) or STNG. My initial impression is that I believe I will probably like Voyager more than I liked DS9 (Deep Space Nine).
Bottom-line, if you like Star Trek and you like good Science Fiction, then I'm sure you'll like Voyager. Having well written stories and excellent character interaction is a Star Trek trademark and the first season of Voyager has an abundance of both.",1082505600,7,2008,4.611731843575419

Unfortunately I live in the country and only got a Fox signal on good summer days so I only ever saw a handful of Voyager episodes.  They were all self-contained and well done.
So I bought this to see if I'd been missing anything.  I was!  The first season introduced the premise and the characters and I got that tingle that you only get from watching a really good Star Trek series.  Story lines were great and were as good as any from Next Generation.  I'm seeing more episodes now from this box than I ever got to see when it was on the air and believe me it's held up well.

The shows are so interesting.  I just love the way the Captain Janeway character handles her crew - she comes across as a very strong leader.  Her character is inspirational for all females.
We need more shows like Voyager that depict women that are not only beautiful but are also very intelligent.  Yes, women can be beautiful and very smart too.  Kudos to the writers of the Star Trek Voyager series.",1079568000,4,461,4.518072289156627
1968044,4,B000127LW2,"Star Trek: Voyager, on a whole, was a series of missed opportunities. They had an interesting premise but it was not built on and fell into normal ""episodic"" television in the later seasons. That said, the first season, while short, was one of the series' best.
The show starts out with Caretaker, an episode which has many characteristics of the original series. You have exploring ""strange new worlds"", a Vulcan officer, a misunderstood alien and those famous ""Starfleet morals.""
Over the next few episodes, we get to deal with the duality of the crews and the conflict it causes. But it is soon dropped in favor ""anomaly or alien of the week."" That isn't a bad thing, but I would have liked to seen more conflict between the crews this season. And the Kazon are one of the most poorly developed enemies that the Trek lore has even seen.
There are some outstanding episodes in this season. Prime Factors deals with the reverse effect of the Prime Directive on the crew and features a fiery reprimand scene at the end. Eye of the Needle has Voyager discovering a worm hole to the Alpha Quadrant. And Heroes and Demons features another malfunctioning holodeck with a fresh new idea and great acting from Robert Picardo.
The DVD's feature a crisp picture quality and the sound is excellent (Voyager has one of the best theme songs in the entire Trek history). The extras are good and features the original Janeway scenes filmed. You will see why Mulgrew was brought in. The actual case is a major disappointment, because you have to remove an odd plastic covering before getting to the disks. Why couldn't they've copied the design of Babylon 5 or Deep Space Nine?
Voyager Season 1 is a good representation of the way the series would unfold. Through its seven seasons, there isn't much character development and they seem the same in Season 7 as they do in this season. While a bit pricey for only 15 episodes, it is worth the investment for Trek collectors.",1079481600,3,1958,4.694767441860465
1968045,3,B000127LW2,"Star Trek Voyager has taken a lot of flack.  'The Red Headed Step Child' of the Trek family took a lot of shots for being mediocre retreads of other Trek stories which had to resort to some cosmic eye-candy to pull in new viewers.  Frankly, I think the series has been given the short end of the stick.  The ensemble does a fine job, and its good to see a Trek show visiting 'strange new worlds' once more.  Its great to see Jennifer Lien(Time and Again) again, and Bob Picardo's Doctor is especially comical in this first season(Heros & Demons).  So aces for the episodes found in this collection.  The extras are pretty good, too.  The piece on Captain Bujold is nearly worth the price of admission alone.
But speaking of the price...  C'mon Paramount !  You've been slowly dropping the price on the Trek boxed sets, but we're not nearly where we should be.  ESPECIALLY when there are only 15 episodes in this first 'season' of Voyager.  And the packaging is truly horrendous.  I'm sure this was someone's idea of a clever novelty, but its just downright awkward and cheap.  If you're going to ask us to pay upwards of a hundred bucks, at least give us something worthwhile.  So as I say, the material is good, but there should be more to offset the price, and the packaging should rise to the quality of the content !",1079395200,107,1320,4.468619246861925

While the first season cannot compare to later seasons, I still found it very interesting and enjoyable. Anyone who considers themselves a serious trekkie must include Voyager in their collection.
My reason for giving this one star is because of its appalling presentation. Sadly again, Paramount has let its US fans down in terms of the design of the boxsets as well as the discs themselves. The discs have absolutely no design printed on it. It's just a plain disc. The boxset while it's an improvement from those of the cardboard types for TNG, is still a far cry from the plastic boxsets from the UK version. Furthermore, there is no pamphlet included in the boxset unlike those of the TNG version.",1079222400,12,792,4.624113475177305

The first four of the five DVDs have newly remastered 5.1 surround sound; it's almost like watching the season in a whole new way. The video quality is astounding. Disc 5, the special features, give an extensive and interesting perspective into the creation of this season. The segment about Bujold being the first Janeway was absolutely amazing. Interesting tidbits are also hidden throughout the menus which include interesting information such as guest star interviews and the evolution of Janeway's hair (can you believe they originally filmed 'Caretaker' with her hair down?). This DVD set clearly does justice to Star Trek: Voyager Season 1, and is well worth the price.",1079049600,4,895,4.933774834437086

These  new ""Star Trek"" adventures would take place in a whole new quadrant of the universe - the delta quadrant - and would lead to a fresh new set of stories that didn't have to necessarily rely on what had gone before. A lone Federation ship and her crew having to deal with a whole new way of life, and many years before it could get home definitely appealed to me.  Also the fact that a female captain was finally cast in a leading role was certainly an excellent move.
My rating is for 4 out of 5 stars because I find the packaging annoying.  I don't like this split, clear slip-case, or whatever you want to call it, deal.  As these DVD's are $100 or more, better care should be taken in the way the package functions and in its appearance. The DVD's are just plain old silver with no fancy pictures on them, which is weird because DS9 had illustrated discs.  I guess I just expect a little bit more when it comes to packaging and the fact that this set only has 5 discs (only 15 episodes) I  feel a little bit skunked, considering the price.  Alas, the collector in me will eventually fork over money I don't have because I am an inveterate nerd.
Overall I enjoyed the first season of ""Voyager.""  The extras were great and I finally got to see who was originally cast for the role of Captain Janeway and why she was wrong for the role.",1078790400,10,1526,4.289198606271777
1968050,5,B000127LW2,"In this different but wonderfully well crafted boxed set of Star Trek Voyager season one; fans of Star Trek Voyager are treated to its first season which, in comparison with the other series, is a very good season.  Of course, Voyager benefits greatly from the mistakes made during the first seasons of Star Trek The Next Generation and Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  With this great first season, Voyager isn't struggling to establish a series or establish a framework to work within, that's already been set up both those two other exceptional series.
Voyager's first season albeit a short one, does a wonderful job of establishing the premise of the series and establishing the characters that will inhabit the imaginations of fans for the next seven years.  One of the better aspects of this season is it doesn't suffer from some of the mistakes made during the second season as in that season they concentrated a little too heavily on the Kazon, which for most fans was a major detractor as I know I was and most fans were asking, when are they ever going to get out of and away from Kazon space.
Of interest to me about this first season and the series as a whole is the series producer's perfect decision to captain this new vessel with a strong female character in Captain Kathryn Janeway, which was a welcome decision that was a long time coming but a definitive eventuality.
The characters of Star Trek Voyager:
Captain Kathryn Janeway - Played brilliantly by Kate Mulgrew, Janeway is a strong and brilliant engineer and sciences minded commanding officer.  Among her strongest features is also her principles which lead her to the decision to save the Ocampa by destroying the Caretaker's array in the premiere episode which results in stranding her crew and the crew of the Maquis ship in the Delta Quadrant with a 70,000 light year trip home to which she vows to her newly combined crew that she will get them home...  After watching the special feature with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway, one simply cannot imagine her having been in this role!
Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran) - Maquis leader and former Starfleet officer; he is a member of a Native American tribe which relocated to what later became the DMZ between the Federation and the Cardassians.  When the treaty went bad for his homeworld, he left Starfleet to fight with the Maquis.  As Janeway's first officer, he must tread the thin line between Maquis principles and rigid Starfleet codes.
Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ) - Vulcan Starfleet security officer who is well aged and to whom many aboard Voyager but especially B'Elanna look upon as a mentor.  Without his counsel, Janeway would be lost.
Lieutenant Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) - Former Starfleet officer that ran into trouble and fled to the Maquis only to end up in a Starfleet prison.  He is a superior pilot and helms Voyager through thick and thin.  This is the Captain Kirk of the crew when it comes to womanizing...
Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) - Fresh from Starfleet Academy; at the outset of the series he is very green in the role of operations officer but look for this character to mature rapidly when faced with everything the crew must face in their journey home.
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) - Half Klingon and half Human former Maquis now Chief Engineer.  Until Seven of Nine shows up, look to this character for some of the strongest non Janeway stories as she continues to struggle between her Klingon and Human sides to achieve some form of inner peace.
The Doctor (Robert Picardo) - Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH Mark I).  Look for this character to provide some of the most poignant and hilarious scenes throughout the seven year run.
Neelix (Ethan Phillips) - A Talaxian who helps Janeway during ""Caretaker"" and along with Kes becomes members of Voyager's crew.  This character will most certainly provide some of the most memorable episodes throughout the series run as he takes on the roles of Ambassador, Head Cook and Morale officer.
Kes (Jennifer Lien) - Ocampan who is rescued during ""Caretaker"" and is, at the outset of the series, Neelix's companion.  During her short time on Voyager she takes on the role as the Doctor's assistant.  The Ocampan's only live for nine years but her part only lasts for three years as she joins the Denise Crosby and Terry Farrell club.
Standout episodes:
Caretaker - I list this one as it does, as a premier episode, a great job of introducing the series even that much more so than the premier episodes of TNG and DS9.
Emanations - This is a highly intriguing episode which goes where few Star Trek episodes dare to go, into ""religion"" and the afterlife.
Heroes and Demons - This episode does a wonderful job of establishing itself and future episodes in which the Doctor will be the prime player.
Faces - This is an extremely fascinating episode that does a superior job in establishing some of B'Elanna's back story while telling a poignant tale.
Jetrel - This is an extremely poignant story about Neelix and the destruction of his home world's moon during a costly war in which the Talaxian's enemy used a weapon of mass destruction.
I highly recommend this series to any and all fans of good Sci-Fi from the universe of Star Trek.  This is a great series that should be given a chance by all fans of Star Trek.  {ssintrepid}

1968051,4,B000127LW2,"Like all Star Treks the series starts a bit in the stupid goofy story way but evolved into one of my favorite Star Trek series.
The reason I give it a 4 star rating is because of:
1) this is the worst package I have encountered, hate it (the case). Deep Space 9 was the best packaging.
2) The whole star trek series is totally a rip off cost wise. twice the price of all other series. (greedy!!!)
I think I'll buy bootlegs of Enterprise since they have already taken more money than they are all worth.

1968052,2,B000127LW2,"Before I discuss the series, let me say that this set is way over priced.  $90.00 for 15 episodes (ep 1 is 90mins) is about $45.00 too much.
Voyager was at best hit and miss.  Good seasons were ones that had 1 or 2 good episodes and hopefully less than half sucked.  Once in a great while they'd actually have a great episode.
Watching the show, you couldn't help but think of Janeway as Star Fleet's Giligan.  I can't count the number of times they had a way home, but she'd find a reason why they shouldn't take it.
Looking back, it's clear that Voyager marked the beginning of the end of Star Trek.  Berman simply has no ideas, and he's dragged Brannagh down to his level.  Instead of interesting shows with new ideas and stories, they gave us recycled TNG over and over again.  That trend has continued on Enterprise.
The best thing I can say about Voyager is that it kept Berman's hands off of Deep Space Nine.  As a result, Steven Ira Behr, Ronald Moore and many other talented writers were able to make a Star Trek that took chances week after week.  They created characters you could care about and story lines that were intrigued the viewer week after week.
Save your money.  Buy the TNG sets.  Better still, buy DS9 (arguably the best Trek series to watch on DVD).  If you have both of those, give the money to charity or use it to start a fire on a cold winter night, but don't support the mediocrity that is Star Trek: Voyager.",1078444800,11,1439,4.348314606741573

1968055,4,B000127LW2,"Practically all possible opinions have already been aired on the DVD release and series. But one of the reviewers wondered that the DVD offered no insight on ""how and why"" Voyager was developed ...  I can supply some pieces of that puzzle.

In 1989, I was a graduate student discussing ST:TNG with two people who said they worked on that show. This was on FidoNet, a national bulletin board system that ran off individual people's computers, not the Internet's Usenet system.

I was harshly critical of the show and, in particular, cut loose after they aired an episode in which Counsellor Troi's mother caught up to the starship Enterprise in a shuttle craft (early summer of 1989).

Finally, one of them asked me ""Well, what do YOU think we should do?"" So I posted back that they needed to take a starship and dump it on the other side of the galaxy where there was no Federation infrastructure to support them and the crew had to struggle to survive and make their way home; no ferrying ambassadors back and forth, no parents of the bridge crew catching up to the ship in a shuttle craft, and so on. Went on for a page or so.

I expected them to argue with me considering all the criticism I had leveled against their show (ST:TNG), and their previous defense. But instead they DISAPPEARED and I never saw them again on FidoNet.

A few years later, ST:TNG ended and I tuned into Voyager in 1995. The ship was immediately dumped on the other side of the galaxy and I thought ""Here's a promising idea ... hmmmm.... say,  wait a minute ... this is pretty familiar. Whoa!""

  Other things that link the origin of Voyager to the FidoNet discussions with ST:TNG staff:

  #1) In 1989, when I laid out the premise of what was to be the next series to the people who claimed to work on ST:TNG, the Voyager spacecraft flyby of the planet Neptune was major news (providing the name of show in the same time-frame as the discussion).

  #2) The fact they stopped posting and disappeared immediately after  the new premise was suggested.

  #3) The subsequent watered-down implementation of Voyager series. That is, they got a premise, but they didn't really ""get it"", as far as intent. The series could almost have occurred in the Alpha quadrant; the fact that they are alone on the other side of the galaxy didn't have the continuous impact on the story-lines you would expect.

If the developer's had originated the idea, they would have had a better handle on the radical implications behind setting the story outside Federation space. Voyager was ""normal"" Star Trek with a different crew which occasionally mentions they want to get home.

Haven't pursued acknowledgement or money, but that's the story. Do have a floppy disk from my old Amiga computer in which I saved all the messages I wrote from those years. Now if I can just recover the encryption key and get the names of the folks I was corresponding with ...",1078272000,,2913,4.626459143968872
1968064,1,B000127LW2,"In a matter of one week, huge numbers of fans have gathered on the message boards of [...] and other websites to discuss their disappointment with the newly released box set, including its packaging, poor quality disc branding, and the shockingly disgraceful special features disk.
When I first got a hold of the box set, I was very excited to have something to look forward to watching that evening. In my mind, all I could think about were ""What are they going to do with this box set?"" First and foremost was the packaging: a new, sleek design intrigued me when I first saw it. However, to my dismay and that of countless fans all throughout the US, we instead discovered a low-quality, poorly constructed box-set providing little to no protection to the discs held within. Furthermore, the box set (opening in two pieces) I found to be quite clumsy and uninteresting. Other than the Voyager logo imprint, there was nothing to make this set ""unique"".
This alone did not dissuade Star Trek fans, however.
Yet we were then again struck down. This time, by the CD branding: a white lettering on a plain, reflective silver background. When held upright to be read, the ST:Voyager label and season/disc number could be read easily, but the episode names and release dates were scratched into the center of CD, and wrapped around the interior circumferance with some 8pt, arial-like font. After having SQUINTED my eyes to finally make out the episode name, ""Caretaker"", I popped the DVD into my player and pressed play.
The DVD menus were, by far, the most blan and un-eventful ever! Both TNG and DS9 box sets provided the viewer with a nearly interactive menu and the feeling and sensation that you were operating out of a console from a Star Trek set. In addition, music and sound FX added to this experience. Instead, we're left with four still images of Voyager, and a delayed Voyager fanfare. At this point, I and others like myself, began to wonder if Paramount had made a mistake with their released box set... if somehow, Paramount had accidentally released a beta version of the set.
Then came the episodes. All crisp quality picture and sound. But that's to be expected with DVD technology and was precedented with TNG and DS9.
After the first disc, many fans quickly moved on to the second disc only to find that, in certain box sets, discs were mixed up and/or missing! Fortunately, I escaped this problem, but countless others who purchased the box set had to return it for another set containing all of the correct discs.
And finally, after watching all of season one's episodes, we arrived at the highly-anticipated special features disc described by startrek.com as containing ""...one of the most interesting ""what if"" scenarios you will ever see is the footage of acclaimed actress Genevihve Bujold as Captain Janeway."" Granted, this special feature was intriguinging and made me wonder how the series would have shaped with that particular captain. But that was all this special features disc had to offer us fans. There was little to nothing about how the actors first approached their characters, any ""funny outtakes"", or even a significant insight as to how and why producers Rick Berman, Jeri Taylor, and Michael Piller came to discovering Voyager. Furthermore, rather than providing anything of value to fans, we reluctantly learned that the startrek.com website was re-vamped four times. My question: WHY!? And some fans have gone so far as to calculate the amount of time each character did talk about their moments on Voyager's launch. This was the biggest shock, as fans everywhere learned that the actors' testimonials COMBINED barely matched the amount of time they gave to talking about the website. Startrek.com went on to state that ""[the] fifth [disc] contain[s] the ever popular bonus features. (Remember, these are why we love DVDs!)."" Indeed, that IS why we love DVDs. Where'd we go wrong?
The special features left me with bewilderment, which was soon followed up by anger and disbelief! This box set is a travesty! In addition, the MSRP of $139.99 is nowhere near justifying its value to the fans, many of which are fed up with Paramount's lack of respect for Star Trek. And while some have come out to speak against Paramount, its has also been said that they would still purchase the box sets, regardless of its poor quality. Why? Because Paramount believes that if they release anything with the Star Trek name on it, it would be purchased by fans. This is unjust and unfair!
We, the fans, demand that Paramount re-release the box sets and supply each season with expanded special features, easier to read disc labeling, and improved packaging equal to or surpassing in quality to that of the British version. To do this, I decided to come to the Communicator and ask to put it in print in an attempt reach countless other fans, and perhaps unite them to finally show Paramount we do not appreciate being taken advantage of.
But please, don't take my word for it. As I write this, more and more fans are viewing and posting to the already growing message board petition at [...] (located in the Star Trek Voyager message boards).",1078099200,53,5167,4.83954802259887
1968065,5,B000127LW2,"I've noticed that there are basically two groups of Star Trek fans: TNG and TOS. If you don't use your brain during the day that much because of your job or you don't ponder questions of morality and humanity in your own time and you want to stimulate that part of your brain using a science fiction tv show, then you go watch TNG. But If you're smart or just plain genius and you use your brain all the time and ponder issues of morality and philosphy on your own time and you just want to come home and enjoy watching a science fiction show with good (or amusing if TOS) science fiction elements, great characters, clever story, and be completely entertained, then you go watch TOS. Voyager is more akin to TOS. It has the same fun-to-watch factor as TOS, but with better special effects. If you're a 2001:Space Odyssey/Titanic type of person (yawn), then you'll like TNG better. If you're more of a Star Wars:New Hope/Raiders of the Lost Ark type of person, then you'll like Voyager better. Although, TNG does has some good episodes. Being a fan of Star Trek, I'll probably get the TNG series also. But collect this one first. It's more fun!",1078099200,6,1144,4.5048076923076925
1968066,4,B000127LW2,"I think Voyager is probably my favourite series of the Star Treks.  Something about Janeway, I guess.  I like her leadership style.  I get the feeling that Voyager found its footing much more quickly than the others.
The extra clips of the first captain was interesting.  Maybe it's just that I've gotten used to Mulgrew, but the clips made me very glad that it was she who played Janeway eventually.
I'm really annoyed, however, that with only 15 episodes the set still costs so much.  I was hoping for some more extras to make up for it.  Yes, Yes, I could have just not bought it, but then I wouldn't have the entire set.  Paramount is terrible in treating their fans this way.  And with this set, they've even really cut back on the packaging.  What I mean is, while the TNG sets came in those nice boxes, the Voyager ones come in a thin plastic case, not even as good as the ones DS9 had.  Not only that, the disks themselves had no design on them like the other series, and once you took off the plastic, there was nothing to protect the top disk.  Yes, I know it seems like a small thing, but people who'd buy these sets are presumably fans who'd want to keep their disks in as great condition as possible.  Especially after they shell out a hundred dollars a season.  This lack of care is one reason why it's lost a star in my rating.
But the episodes themselves are great.  With the clarity of the DVD, it's almost like seeing the series in a completely new way.  It's always funny to look at the hairstyles of the first seasons in any of the star treks.  And Neelix's coat when he first gets on the ship!  Oh, dear.  But the episode with his missing lung I thought was kind of silly.",1078012800,3,1693,4.287066246056782

In these post 911 times, it's good to be reminded of fairness, high ideals, the power of diplomacy and the rest of the Star Trek Guidelines to Civilized Living .

Having read most of the reviews on Amazon about substandard packaging. Helped me reach this decision, the fans of STV are being ripped off.
1 poor DVD case
2 no labels on DVDs
3 only 15 shows [yes the show did start in Jan]
4 Prices range from $84.99 to $119.99 per set brand new.[same price as the full season of shows]
First thing tomorrow I will be returning my set for a full refund. Maybe this will help send a message to Star Trek organization. We are willing to pay the price but in return we expect to have a quality item",1078012800,12,598,4.119658119658119
1968069,4,B000127LW2,"I loved Star Trek Voyager! The DVD Box set is Excellent! Unfortunately, I purchased it from Suncoast Video because I have a 'Replay Rewards' card that sends me back discount coupons to use towards future purchases! Suncoast wants one hundred and eleven dollars for the set(And that is ON SALE! Their normal price for the set after the sale is, get this, One Hundred and Thirty-Nine Ninety-Nine! OUCH!!) Paramount could have made the price a bit more reasonable for the Trek fans! The ONE thing I really have wanted to see all of these years were the scenes that were filmed by the first choice for Captain Janeway played by actress Genevieve Bujold! Thank God!!!-Kate Mulgrew took over the part. Contrary to what Rick Berman said about Bujold on the special features DVD about why they went with Mulgrew...  The reason Bujold was let go was because of how difficult she was to deal with.  She hated the tight uniforms, and thought they looked silly! She was totally impossible to deal with from what I had read in magazines when Voyager was getting ready to launch UPN!! And when you get to see the parts she filmed for 'The CareTaker' 2 hour pilot for Voyager... And then compare it to Kate Mulgrew's scenes in Caretaker you'll be glad Kate took over the role of Janeway!  Bujold was just too stiff and uncaring in her acting in the role of Janeway.  The scene where Janeway explains to Tuvock about Harry Kim's mother wanting to send Harry's clarinet to him... When you look at Bujold's take on that scene and then see Kate Mulgrew doing the same scene... Kate showed a lot more caring about the character of Harry Kim, and her crew then Bujold did. So I highly recommend this DVD set to all the Trek fans, and Voyager fans out there! It's a *MUST* have set!!  But as I said, the price could have been better for everyone if it was about fifty-nine dollars since it only has 15 episodes! But I guess Paramount needs to make up some cash on their ailing franchise someplace. So why not soak the fans for it! LOL! I also read on the literature that came with the DVD set (Oh, and these sets so far do not come with booklets like TNG did) that Paramount is going to release the entire Original Star Trek Series again, but as boxed sets too in 2005! FINALLY! Something they should have done in the first place! So as I said... I HIGHLY recommend this set!  So far Amazon has the best price for it! So grab it while the price is this LOW now!!!!! And I also hope the bonus DVD's that come with the sets during the first months of their releases will be a bit better then what came with Voyager!  I would love to see the PC program ""Star Trek Voyager Utilities CD"" come out as a bonus disc with one of the sets, or even a Voyager companion CD that shows clips from all the episodes, and text synopsis's of each show too.  TNG and the DS9 set came with one of these PC CD's.
Thanks for reading my review!

1968070,5,B000127LW2,"Star trek Voyager is my first DVD season collection. Though I have lots of movies I had to get Voyager season 1 when paramount announced that they were releasing the whole series on DVD! And I am happy to say that I am SATISFIED. I just finished viewing all the discs and the quality of both video and Audio are quite good. Yes the Bass is not too good but then thats how it was even on TV! So theres not much reason to complain if you enjoy the show. Coming back to the episodes they were mostly good in the first season but the real good ones are there in season 3 and season 5. Anyhow I plan to get all the seasons on DVD. I also see from the packing that Paramount is releasing the original Star trek series on DVD. That should be interesting . Before I go kudos to Amazon for their superb shipping! I pre-ordered and received my copy on 26th through expedited shipping! By the way I am from India!! Keep up the great work guys.

I mean when TNG came out the boxes where nice and very protective, I mean we payed 100 dollars or more for the sets, they should be nice.  Then we got DS9, they went a little cheaper for the cases, but I think they made up for it with the images on the disks.  But with Voyager, come on, whats the deal.  Really cheap plastic case, mine already broke, and they disks are just plain silver.  Nothing on them, and you really have to look to see even whats on them.  Paramount needs to take a look at what they give the folks in Europe as compaired to here in the USA, have you seen the box sets that came out over there????  Well they are nice.  Please Paramount get a clue and fix this mess with the rest of the 6 seasons.  I know I'm not the only one who posted a review like this....",1077667200,5,935,4.060109289617486

It's flimsy (the thickness of throw-away ""bubble-pack""), takes too many steps to take it apart, doesn't protect the DVDs properly, and is overall the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  Whoever invented it should be fired and whoever made the administrative decision to use it should be boiled in oil! BOO!!!",1077667200,9,449,4.96
1968074,4,B000127LW2,"Voyager recaptured the spirit of The Original Series with its setting in the unexplored part of the galaxy. In the pilot episode we're introduced to Kathyrn Janeway the Captain of the Voyager as she attempts to locate her Security Officer Tuvok. It seems Tuvok was working undercover with the Marqui a rebel group of homesteaders that are trying to preserve their settlements. The Federation has turned the planets the Marqui have settled over to another alien species as part of a treaty.
Tuvok disappeared along with the crew he was spying on. Janeway recruits convict and former Marqui/Starfleet Officer Tom Paris to help her locate Tuvok. When they enter the distorted and unstable space called the Badlands (where the Marqui frequently hide), Voyager is hit by an energy wave that carries her 70,000 light years from home--essentially across the galaxy to unexplored space. They are transported against their will to what appears to a celebration at a farmhouse on Earth circa 1930. The mystery continues to deepen as the inhabitants are clearly hiding something or someone.
The beginning of Voyager's pilot episode sparkles with conflict, adventure and energy. In many respects, Voyager recalls The tone and purpose of The Original Series with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. The stories still simmer with political overtones and adventure but with a much different background than Next Generation or DS9. The capable cast more delivers particularly Kate Mulgrew as Janeway and Robert Picardo as the irritable Emergency Medical Hologram.
Yes, there were some minor characters that were a bit irritating and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the cast but, well, you try and work out the kinks during the first season. On the whole, the writing is uniformly strong.
The handsome transfer suffers from few blemishes. There's some digital artifacts noticeable particularly during the optical effects (in the form of edge enhancement)but that's not really all that distracting. The lively colors and set design along with the sharp direction (particularly in the pilot episode)make even the so-so written episodes worth watching.
I do have two complaints one minor and one major. The boxed set is priced the same as the full seasons for Next Generation and DS9 but there's only the first fifteen episodes of season one included (amazon.com is incorrect about there being sixteen as the pilot was broadcast as a two hour episode). This should have been price at considerably less than it is based on the total episodes and extras included.
My second complaint is regarding the packaging. Next Generation's bulky boxes were admittedly a bit large but they did protect the discs and were very nicely designed. DS9's sets streamlined the process replacing the box with a plastic, thin slimcase which sat better on the shelf with other DVDs and sets. Voyager looks cheap. The plastic containter has a single illustration of the ship on the front and the rest is made up of thin plastic. The box is split in the middle and you must pull it apart to get to the discs themselves. They are housed in an orange plastic container similar to DS9's clear ones. They seem less sturdy although they probably aren't. Still the slipcase looks cheap and the series (and fans) deserve much better particularly when you're paying as much as the other Trek sets.
There are some nice extras to be had including most of the footage shot with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway for the pilot episode. There's also an assembly edit of one particular unfinished section from the pilot before Bujold and the Trek team decided to part company. Berman's politically correct comments don't dish any dirt. While Bujold is fine as Janeway, she doesn't carry the authority of Mulgrew and is a bit of a disappointment in the role.
The other extras include a visual effects featurette; original interviews produced during the series run with various cast members; a look at the creation and content for the Voyager website; a location featurette on the Kazons; Andre Bormanis the science consultant and one of the writers discusses the incorporation of real space phenomena and theories; archival footage of Kate Mulgrew discussing her role as Janeway and a new featurtette focusing on creating the new series with pilot episode co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Pillar and Jeri Taylor discussing the various challenges they faced.  There's also a photo gallery included.
The sound is spectacular and available for the first time in 5.1 Surround although it isn't used quite as well as a theatrical feature might have.
The Voyager boxed set isn't disappointing--many of the best episodes deserve 5 stars and the featurettes are also quite good as well. The sound is a stand out as is the transfer despite some minor blemishes. It'll make a good addition to a fan's collection. I only wish that Paramount had given fans a sturdier box for the film and one that didn't look so cheap.",1077667200,2,4937,5.020731707317073
1968075,4,B000127LW2,"If it weren't for the packaging, I'd have given this set 5 stars. It's terrible, but then the series never really seemed to be supported by TPTB as it's predecessors, TNG & DS9 so the tacky packaging should come as no surprise.
It is a lot of money for 15 episodes, but remember that the first season started in January and that a couple of the episodes were held until the fall, starting with the 37's.
I've not seen the special features yet, but from what I read on the box, it's well worth waiting, esp. any new footage featuring Kate Mulgrew! I look forward to seeing the next full season on DVD.",1077667200,2,600,4.31858407079646

ST TNG had a great box, ST DS9 was also packaged very well. Evidently someone's cousin got the packaging deal for ST Voyager. The box is a low cost plastic that opens from the top. You then pull out the disks that are in a nice orange holder. But the first disk is not covered so you can easily get it dirty and marked up. The disk labels are not easily readable since the titles are near the center. This makes it very difficult to read the episodes on the disk.  Thank goodness the episodes are listed on the back of the box.  This is no where as nice as the previous sets. I just got the set today and haven't seen any of the extras yet. But I was disappointed in the packaging as you can see. ST Voyager is like the original series in that it tried something new. And I really am excited that it is finally out. My suggestion is that for nearly $100, for a set of dvd's, the packaging could've been better.

There are no inserts, no pictures on the dvd's, and the case splits into two in a way that is very awkward.  I paid $90.00 for this??!!
I so hope the Voyager people read these reviews because I will not give them anymore of my money unless they improve their product.  I feel so disrespected as a fan of this series.

1968079,4,B000127LW2,I've been looking forward to this DVD set for years.  The Voyager series is my second favorite after the Original series.  All of the Star Trek DVD's have been a little high priced compared to other series and DVD packages with a few exceptions....the Special Editions of the Star Trek movies were a pleasant surprise.  I noticed on Amazon's details section for this set it never did mention how many disks were included....only the small number of episodes 16....(compared to other TV series).  Well after a trip to Wal-Mart the answer is 5-disks for $98 plus tax.  A price of $75 for the smaller number of disks would have been fair.  I will wait for the first season to drop in price before I buy.  I certainly hope the later seasons are not even more expensive for the additional number of disks.  The artwork on the back of the first set shows the other six seasons with probably 7 disks apiece.  Thanks to Amazon for beating Wal-Mart's price but still too high for now.,1077580800,,975,4.557471264367816
1968080,1,B000127LW2,"Who designed the package box? Naomi Wildman???
The TNG DVD sets were great and included nice pictures, a booklet, and a sweet fold out cardboard box. Very classy and very well worth the $100 a pop.
DS9's DVD set was a let down from the superior TNG pakaging, but still included pics and an episode timeline. Not to mention the DVDs, themselves, had pictures printed on them.
Now we come to VOYAGER... What the...??? Very shoddy packaging. The discs are blank and have the episodes written (in a spiral) on the clear plastic rim in the center of the disc. Someone even forgot that ""Caretaker"" was the first episode. No pics either. The color is nice (compared to DS9's basic black) but the plastic splits into two awkward pieces.
I cannot see spending $100 per season when it is obvious that Berman & Braga are just out to screw the fans for every last dollar they can get their grubby little hands on.
I envision the ENTERPRISE packaging will consist of DVD-R discs thrown into a plastic baggy with some bubble wrap in it.
Paramount should be ashamed of themselves for such a blatant rip-off.",1077580800,16,1092,4.605128205128205

1968092,5,B000127LW2,"Of all the Star Trek series ever made, Voyager ranks as my all time favorite. Why? If James Cameron had written and directed for a Star Trek series, it would have been Voyager. Never in the history of the Star Trek series have there been so formidable an assortment of strong female lead and supporting characters on one ship. And kudos to Kate Mulgrew for giving us one of the most heroic and formidable starship captains of all time. Hows that for a novel female lead. That woman was robbed by the Emmys. This series is also what is what it was intended to be, the most intensely action packed of them all. No starship in Starfleet history has taken the beating that Voyager has.  And Voyager boasts more battle sequences and Borg for your buck than any of its predecessors, including one very formidable Borg Queen. For best achievement in lighting, art direction, acting and special effects and sound, Voyager has my vote. And if you don't believe that, have a look at Star Trek the Next Generation and compare its dated special effects, make-up and horrid lighting (not to mention bad actors, with the exception of the Captain and Data). Also try comparing the acting talents and characters of Next Generation to Voyager, B'Elanna Torres compared to Geordi La Forge? Dr. Beverly Crusher compared to THE DOCTOR? Data compared to Seven of Nine? Please Oh and lets not forget the horror of Next Generations Natasha Tasha Yar and Wesley Crusher ugggghhh. Give me Katherine Janeway, The Doctor, Seven of Nine and the entire crew of the Starship Voyager any day. The episodes: Scorpion One and Two should have been made into a major motion picture. Two of the most brilliantly written star trek episodes ever. Look for those episodes in future DVD releases. Need I say more? Run, don't walk to order yours now.",1077148800,3,1809,4.724683544303797
1968093,3,B000127LW2,"Voyager's concept was to show what would happen to a crew stranded far from home, away from the protection of Starfleet and the Federation, with a crew made up of politically correct Starfleet officers and survivors of defiant Federation constituents. Before her mission can begin, the crew is swept the crew 70, 000 light years away, into the uncharted space of the Delta Quadrant. But from the beginning, it seemed Voyager was doomed. While the series was a return to TOS old fashioned naval romance, it had a dangerous corporate utopian view that I was unable to overlook. That said, however, the opener was not half-bad, and it set up many, many story ideas that could have been expounded on. One might have been the mixing of the Starfleet crew and the Maquis crew -a strong criticism of the show has been the lack of tension between the Starfleet and Maquis crews, something which many thought should have been explored in much more detail. Or Tom's voyage from a misguided youth to redemption (something that was covered a bit in season' one and two- all part of a plan to discover who was sending transmissions to the Kazon, and then oddly picked up again in season five -which by then seemed out of character), to the plight of Harry as always an ensign and never anything more How about Tuvok, who must deal with Chakotay as his commanding officer (one guessed that Tuvok was a full commander during the pilot, and somehow was demoted). But all of that was quickly brushed aside like so much dead leaves under the TNG's jingoistic notion that we were all one, big happy family. They took away the conflict, which was odd, considering that during TNG's run, most critics agreed that its biggest problem was that was too little conflict between the characters. Voyager returned to TOS (and TNG somewhat) of episodic story telling. The only real arc to the series would be them lost in the Delta Quadrant. The issue from the start, whether from the Paramount executives or Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, was that the show should remain self-contained. So with Voyager, the show was designed not for the fans of either TNG or DS9, but for the causal fan; for the viewer who could not remember the show was on week-to-week, the ""absentee viewer"" as someone once put it. So the story telling of DS9 was replaced, because those themes were ""too lofty for a (show like Voyager's) broad-based audience,"" as Michael Piller put it in an interview with the official Star Trek website. That locution, in particular, has become an over used catch phrase, which can easily be translated as straight, white males So continuity and the Prime Directive (one of my favorite examples comes in a line written Braga, the worst of the lot when it came to the Prime Directive, in the episode Prototype, where Janeway spouts something about who are we to play God and then continue on our way? The only answer, of course, was the crew of Voyager. It would only get worst as the series progressed) were tossed out airlock with the baby water, all in the name of telling a story. As the first season progressed, it wobbled, it sank, it rose, and it shifted its concept like sand in a desert. It introduced two very inferior alien enemies, the Kazon and the Vidiian's. Both failed because they weren't sinister enough to scare a cockroach back into its dark corner. The Kazon, who where to be based on L.A. gangs, were just a bunch of petulant children who had cool ships, but were always fighting to find out which sect would rule. And despite the Seska/Culluh alliance, they never were more menacing than stock TV villains. The Vidiian's, while creepy, were mishandled. Besides they weren't really evil, they just did appalling things in pursuance of their goals (and might I add here's where a continuity expert should have been hired. In Phage, Janeway makes it perfectly clear that if the Vidiians interfere with them again, she'll open a can of whoop ass on them. Alas, when they pop up again in Faces, nothing happens to them). So, these two were not the Klingons or the Cardassians. They were just boring. So, the first season limped along like a cart with a misalign wheels. And while most of the acting was good outside of Mulgrew's, the stories lacked real originality, filled with terminally uninteresting characters, and featured way to much technobabble, with Time and Again being one of the most well known episodes to go overboard using it. Most of the stories seemed to be hobbled together from other concepts; as if Piller, Berman and Braga took all the stories they had not used on TNG and DS9 and tried to make them some how work on Voyager. But proposing the same flawed ideas over and over again was not making the show good. Only Eye of the Needle and Jetrel can be said to be one of the best of the first season, and while I enjoyed Emanations (because it will become a rare treat to watch Garrett Wang at the center of a story), the rest of season lacked a certain quality.",1077062400,11,4980,4.6538024971623155
1968094,5,B000127LW2,"I grew up with Star Trek. In the 70's and 80's, when I was a kid, the reruns of all the old Star Trek episodes were playing. When TNG came out, I felt betrayed because, well, it wasn't Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones and all the other charachters that I grew up watching. Of course after watching TNG I, like most of the fans, saw the brillance in it and continued watching.
Well, when DS9 came out I saw it a few times and well, just stopped watching. When Voyager came out I wasn't even interested in seeing it.
All this was until 2002. Unfortunately I didn't start catching the show until the last few seasons. Then I saw all the reruns at lease twice; I never missed an episode. After watching the whole series, I would have to say that this is the best Star Trek series. Every charachter is great, the stories are great, and the journey is awesome. This is more like what Star Trek was originally since it's not so scripted; meaning, the crew never knows what's going to happen.
In TNG, they were always getting calls and had to go to the Nuetral Zone to save some cat on a tree or whatever, but in Voyager, they are in the Delta quandrant and don't have Starfleet to rely on.
This has become my favorite Star Trek series, even beating TNG and the original series. Tuvok by far is the best Vulcan of any Star Trek series (even Spock!), 7 of 9 is awesome (physically too, of course, but I mean her charachter). Belana, Tom Paris, Janeway, the whole crew is just awesome. Even Hector from Night of the Comet has a great role in this! Seriously though, this is an awesome series and a must for any Star Trek fan.
After looking over this I realized I am a dork. I never thought about it before, but now I know. I'm a Star Trek freak but never really realized it. Wow... I wonder if it was all that Romulan Ale?",1076803200,3,1806,4.252906976744186

TREK had explored all aspects of the ""final frontier"" and were we to believe that in the 24th century there weren't any intrepid female leaders braving the unknown of space exploration.
The center gem of the third spin-off in TREK lore is of course it's captain (as it should be) Kathyrn Janeway as protrayed by Kate Mulgrew etched her own legend; a status all onto herself that may not have always worked but she made  it worth tuning into every week.  She is a captain not unlike her predecesors faced with own unique challenges.  Janeway must get her crew home after losing them in the far reaches of an unknown part of the galaxy.

Si imagine my delight when Voyager was launched! And the captain was...a woman! That was a serious departure from Captain Kirk's macho attitude and even from The Next Generation, where women were still assigned the ""caregiver"" roles (psychologist, physician). And Kate Mulgrew really delivered...oh, man, was she good! And she certainly didn't need to show a ripped physic and get into constant fistifights, unlike Enterprise's Scott Bakula...Also, the concept of the crew being isolated in a faraway galaxy, with a very slim chance of getting back home worked beautifully, making for some very compelling stories.

1968100,1,B000127LW2,"Trek has a proud history of creativity, engaging stories, rich charachters and an ability to make social comments without being a blunt instrument.  All that ended with this series.  Set with an over the top PC crew Voyager drags us along offending any true star trek fans sensibilities.  All the major charachters could have been replaced by the life sized card-board cutout counterparts and delivered approximatly the same performance.  The total lose of imagination is clearly evident in the seemingly never ending stories of the ships holodeck, or some rogue hologram.  As if the adventure of unexplored space couldn't provide infinatly more excitement than dragging out the tired old cliche ""haywire holodeck"" routine.  It didn't work for Star Trek TNG and it CERTAINLY doesn't work here either.  The villians are no more thoughtful than the primary charachters.  Carbon copies of the mustache twirling archtype or some other ripped off race idea such as the Hirogen being nearly stolen bodely from the ""Predator"" films.  When this series was still running originally it was doing very poorly, so what did they do.  They took out the only charachter that even remotely had an unusaul clever background and replaced her with some top heavy woman in a slinky outfit to try to lure viewers to the show instead of acutally working on plot or the intellegince of the show. That is not what Star Trek is about. Janeway, the first female captain is self-serving and sanctomonious in her attitude,yet holds others to the very highest code of morality.  However when she breaks such rules of conduct, all is forgiven. This is not to mention the fact that she was made so overpowered that one wonders why she even needed a crew.  Two-faced and pompous she is not likeable nor is she a good leader, Her ship would have been aptly named ""THE BOUNTY"".  Using the Maque, a rogue organization broken away from starfleet, removed any adventure from exploration and turned it into a self absorbed hunt to get home at ANY cost. I don't want to get into specifics of the series,( a requirement to writing a review is not to reveal plot points), but lets say the borg should have no problem conquering Earth and the Alpha Quadrent after its run in with Janeway, especially the last episode.  Though this doesn't happen until later seasons, just giving a heads up.  In summation,...don't waste your hard earned money on this dvd series set.  It is an insult to Trek and Trek fans.  If you have never seen it and are thinking about it,do this instead,..get 1 video and watch it.  More than likely it will be the same plot line as 9/10 of each other episode.  Just with the charachter roles switched around a bit.  If you don't like Trek and love monotinous stories, tired plots, cliche charachters and non-sequitor logic this series is for you.

This season gave Voyager a bad reputation that it REALLY had to work hard to overcome. For example, if I'm not mistaken, this season contains the episode where the ship escapes through a ""hole"" in some object's gravity well. Anyone who is familiar with basic Newtonian physics should realize that this concept is so colossally stupid, it's a miracle that this show ever got the thumbs-up from KBHK (now UPN). The acting was pretty horrible, too. And in the season's gripping cliffhanger finale, Tuvok helps bridge the gap between the Maquis and the rest of the crew by berating the Maquis for their attire, and the ship is threatened by none other than Neelix's bad cooking. While in later seasons Neelix and his questionable culinary skills would prove time and again to be life-threatening for the crew, such stupid plot devices were never used for finales. I guess the writers learned their lesson.

1968114,5,B000127LW2,"In late 1993, prior to the beginning of what would become Star Trek: The Next Generation's last season, Rick Berman was given a phone call from Paramount Studios to begin work on a new Star Trek television series.
However, this series would be unlike any previous created version.  The studio had decided that this show would be the first creation for the United Paramount Network (later to become UPN or Paramount Network), as the show's tagline stated, it simply ""was the show that launched a network"".
Early on, Berman decided that not only would he executive produce, but he would share that role with Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller who were primarily running The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine respectively, while Berman was creating Star Trek: Generations.  As the three met in secret meetings for months, they eventually decided on a rich cast of characters in a unique setting, Star Trek was truly going into the unknown, even moreso than in The Original Series, to the complete other end of the galaxy (wonder why we never encountered the question ""What does God need with a Starship"" on this show), and created a rich environment.
The first season of this show was amazingly written, and it by far is the most pollished Star Trek debut to date.  Yes, this series is not your perfect modern drama, if you want that, go to the store and pick up Deep Space Nine.  yes this show does not have the big recognition that others want, if you want that, go to the store and pick up the original or TNG.  However, if you want an amazingly pollished, written, acted show with characters that had an unbelieveable chemistry right from the beginning, (unlike Deep Space Nine which in time did become the best acted series) and with this season specifically, will show to you contemporary issues, but not preach or put blame upon you, then I wholeheardedly recommend Star Trek: Voyager's first season.  Pick up the first, second,third, fourth, and seventh for sure as they come out, and if you find you like them you may want five and six, five especially was amazingly written at times, but has several obvious flounders of the writing staff trying to figure out what to do.  As for the first season, you won't be dissapointed.",1074297600,7,2229,4.729381443298969

1968116,5,B000127LW2,"Although I have been critical of Voyager in the past, I must confess that it was nothing short of impressive in its first three seasons. The show had so much promise, its huge story arcs and original concept made it a show to watch. The first season had the show proving itself quite nicely, with riveting science fiction and the intense drama of two disparate crews trying to work together. This show certainly had the makings of a champion, and although it certainly didn't fulfill all hopes, it had more than a few good moments.
Voyager's first season put exposition on hold to give us great stories. The approach paid off, as many were hooked on the show from the beginning. One of the show's greatest strengths was combining human drama and science fiction in such a way that the season never got formulaic, and we certainly saw that here. ""Caretaker"" was a magnificent pilot that nicely set up the show, introduced the crew's principal enemies and some of the tumultuous politics of the Delta Quadrant, and had quite a bit of excitement and suspense. From there, we saw episodes dealing with classic Star Trek motifs like time travel (Time and Again), unusual life forms (The Cloud), and justice (Ex Post Facto, one of the season's best shows). The show also tackled unfamiliar territory, such as genocide (Jetrel, another of the season's best shows) and treason (State of Flux, where Seska defects to the Kazon). All the while we got to know (albeit less than in the second season) the various officers of the ship: Janeway, the stern but optimistic captain (and, in the first year, far from the sanctimonious shrew she became); Paris, the navigator and funnyman (he provided the best comic relief) and his friend Kim, the homesick wet-behind-the-ears recent Academy graduate; Tuvok, the wry Vulcan; the Doctor, a crotchety hologram (and also very amusing); and Neelix and Kes, the pair of aliens along for the ride. The first season did a good job of introducing them, although it wasn't until the second season that they really became more concrete.
The DVD is loaded with extras, probably to compensate for the fact that the set is exorbitantly priced. In any case, it's a must have for a collector or a fan.",1074124800,54,2218,4.793733681462141
1968117,5,B000127LW2,"VOYAGER is, by far the best Star Trek ever. I grew up on watching TNG and DS9, but in 1995, VOYAGER began its legacy. The unique story, and interesting characters is where VOYAGER shines the most.  The best thing about VOYAGER, however is that all the characters, (and I mean all of them) Evolve or change drasticly from the begginning to end.  I simply love this show, I think it is the best Sci Fi show of all time and I cant wait for the DVD of season one, to seven.
As for the DVD special Features...it looks like paramount is improving with every Star Trek set they come out with.  This set has new and old interveiws, several documentaries (Real Science sounds particualrily interesting) even footage from their first choice as Captain Kathryn Janeway, Genevieve Bujold. Which will also be very interesting.  VOYAGER came out right when the internet was becoming increasingly popular, so website desinger and producer of the show: Marc Wade, explains and shows how an interactive VOYAGER website was created to help launch the series.  On Location with the kazon has some interesting behind the scenes look at the kazons in the pilot episode.  And finally RED ALERT!: Visual Effects season one has an interesting look at all the special effects done on the first season.
So mark FEB 24th on your calanders fellow fans of VOYAGER, and get ready for the best Trek series to launch on DVD.

1968118,5,B000127LW2,"I know that most people didn't like Voyager *my step mom* but it really was a great series. Even though Gene Roddenberry wasn't involved, I think it held up his ideas of the future perfectly. ""To seek out new life and new civilizations..."" these words were evident in every last episode of Voyager. A lot of people thought that the idea of a starship lost on the other side of the galaxy was too far off from the ""Star Trek theme"" but I think it was dead on.
The series starts off with Captain Janeway taking out Starfleet's most advanced starship, the U.S.S. Voyager, into the Badlands in search of a lost Maquis ship and ends up lost in the Delta Quadrant. Courtesy of the Caretaker, who then obducts a member from each crew; B'Elanna Torres the half-Klingon Maquis, and Harry Kim, Voyager's Ops officer. They are then led to a planet that is home to a race called the Ocampa where they meet Kes and the Kazon Ogla for the first time. Their guide in this strange new area of space is the talkative and resourceful Talaxian, Neelix. After destroying the Caretakers array to protect the Ocampa from the Kazon, Janeway and her crew of Starfleet and Maquis personnel, set out to make their way home. The journey will take 75 years at top speed, as they are 70,000 light-years from home. The two crews must work together along with Kes and Neelix to find a way home and never give up hope of reaching it.",1072569600,4,1401,4.455252918287938
1968119,3,B000127LW2,"Although both DS9 and Voyager were continuations of the Star Trek continuum following TNG, each tried to differentiate itself from (happy idealistic) TNG in various ways. DS9 was dark and brooding, and everything didn't work itself out by the end of the weekly episode - generally speaking, DS9 is Star Trek for (brooding?) pragmatists, not idealists, happy or otherwise.
Voyager's twist is to be Star Trek for the metaphysical/New Age crowd - a kind of Star Trek for brooding idealists, if you will. I can't forget the scene with Chakotay showing Janeway how to contact her spirit animal/familiar with his meditation rock, during which she gained keen insight into the Problem of the Week and subsequently saved her crew and ship. This New Age element is lost in later seasons (thankfully), but the first two years in particular are notable for this persistent theme, and I can't speak to Season 3. If such alternative practices aren't your style, you may find some of Voyager annoying. I certainly did. Like DS9, Season 1 of Voyager wasn't a happy Star Trek, but in a very different way.
Having shared what I perceive to be the greatest flaw of this show, let me also applaud the great characters and settings that were apparent from the get-go. Janeway is a fantastic captain worthy of the Kirk/Picard/Sisko legacy. I have read several reviews that mention her unique command style - its all true, Kate Mulgrew was terrific in the role! Tuvok, Neelix, Kes, Kim, and Paris were also very likeable personae. Chakotay and Torres, the major Maquis characters, were generally good additions to the mix, although they could have been better. I expected the former Maquis members to be stronger characters, along the lines of DS9 Maquis. The most intriguing species from Season 1 (and from any Trek series/season in my opinion) was the Vidiians, a formerly Federation-like, medically advanced race now forced to steal body parts from others for their own survival. The horror factor of this race rivals that of the Borg. The Vidiians are truly to be feared, avoided, and pitied. It was unfortunate that we saw so little of such a facinating culture.
As a stout Star Trek, particularly DS9, and Babylon 5 fan, I gave this show a lot of attention early on, but largely ceased watching halfway through Season 2 - I was a bit too New Age for my tastes. I came back and enjoyed later seasons, and I think most viewers would enjoy all 7 seasons of this show - just be aware. I don't think Season 1 of Voyager realized its potential, but it certainly wasn't a bad product. The show definitely recovered to become a very strong addition to the Trek pantheon by the close of the series.",1072483200,13,2673,4.775377969762419
1968120,5,B000127LW2,"Star Trek: Voyager, the newest of the (as I call it) 3 sagaed series, taking place in the same basic year.  When Voyager first started everybody was unsure of how it would do.  Both Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation had a concept and actors that were extremely liked.  Not to mention Deep Space 9 was a completely new concept of a space station rather than a ship.  Voyager's biggest competition was The Next Generation with the ever popular Captain Jean Luke Picard (Patrick Stewart).
Voyager by far is the most unusual Star Trek series to date.  A single ship in impossible odds lost 70,000 light years from the nearest Federation outpost.  Two crews, Starfleet and Maquis, the noble and the terrorists.  Wow that's one way to start an incredible journey.  But wait not only are you involving terrorists on the most advanced star ship in the Federation, let's add their chief con officer Thomas Eugenie Paris to that...an ex convict.  But it figures even in another part of the galaxy not everybody agrees with Starfleet's ideals, 5 minutes in the Delta Quadrant and Voyager already makes an enemy, known as the Kazon.

  My biggest gripe is about the price of this first season.

This is a show I approached with an open mind. Many had decried TNG and DS9 before they even started - as with those shows I waited until I had actually watched it. Voyager fell very quickly with some dire storytelling.
There is a guy I know who rubbishes TNG saying that it stole all its storylines from the original serise. First of all, only a few storylines are obvious rip-offs. Second, Voyager does its share of ripping-off. I still can't believe that it ripped-off the original series turkey ""Spock's Brain"" (ie ""The Phage"" aka ""Neelix's Lungs"")!
Even the one episode I liked first time around, ""Eye of the Needle"" isn't as good second time around. Voyager is the series that really eroded what Star Trek was about. Predictable story-arcs, laughable temporal-anomaly stories (Year of Hell being an utter clunker), and poor story-telling (the suicide of a Q in season 2 being a missed opportunity) make this the nadir of the Star Trek franchise. If there is an 11th film and it focuses on the Voyager crew then it will be the first ST film I don't go and see.

Chakotay the stable rock and foundation to B'Elanna and her fiery temper and the all inquisitive holographic Doc.

and I must say it falls in the same pitfall as Enterprise more
often than I would have expected.
Of couse I'm talking about the constant need for timetravel,
parallel universes and alternate futures.  I really became
annoyed with this in Enterprise.  Are they that desperate?  Then I realized, looking
at TNG again that they do the same thing. Do you realize how
screwed up the universe would be just from one ST series?
I really liked Voyager, but I would agree that there were
too many encounters with the Borg. (And enterprise got so
desperate they had to go there too) I never understood the
whole Marquis thing. All these differences but they are
starfleet officers? Mmmm...  But I never saw the first
episodes for some reason, I don't think my station ever showed them.

Also, the ending was terrible! Hey, Timetravel again! Surprise.

As a first season it beats TNG and DS9,which its improved effects, faster paced action and stronger budget. The pilot episode is especially strong,with a effective story and superb acting to back it up. Kate Mulgrew is very convincing as a powerful female captain,and the other roles seemed to be cast just right. The ship is new and fresh and looks alot more up to date,as do the sets.
However in contrast to later seasons this is not voyager at its best (especially as its missing Jeri Ryan),star trek does its usual and uses the first year for us to get to know the characters and the ship.
Voyager as a series goes through different stages from good to superb and then drops a few bars to average. Towards the last few years the stories get repetitive and strained,almost as if they had run out of ideas,too many episodes were focused on the borg (as a result ruining there image and reputation) instead of introducing us to new aliens.

1968127,5,B000127LW2,"In the year 1987, I fell in love...with Star Trek.  I was 4 when I watched the original broadcast premier of TNG in our livingroom.  I sat through the whole thing without falling asleep, and since then I've made it a point to watch each and every episode of each series.  After TNG ended, DS9 came along and filled the void...very admirably I might add.  After that was Voyager, and then Enterprise (which I think is a great show).  I have to say that although I enjoyed all the different series, Voyager was different.  Captain Janeway had to fulfill not only the duties of a Starship Captain, but she also had to become a friend to her crew while simultaneously heading back toward the Alpha Quadrant, making new allies and enemies every day. To me, this added a new dimension to the show that had not been present in the rest.  Over the course of seven great seasons there were, of course, episodes which should have been written better...every show has them.  But to me, the true judge of a show's character is not necessarily how many 'excellent' episodes there are, but rather the stories they choose to tell, and the way they choose to tell them.  Star Trek has always been about the imagination, and Star Trek Voyager is a wonderful example of the imagination at work.  All of the shows are.  TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, and even Enterprise (which I think, after three seasons has finally found its place) are all a part of the greatest story ever told, and no story is complete without all its parts.

If you want to see the best Star Trek series, go check out DS9. If you can't get that, then go watch the original series, or TNG, or even Enterprise. But please don't waste your time on Voyager.

1968132,5,B000127LW2,"I wasn't much of a Star Trek Fan until I watched a few of the beginning episodes of ""Voyager"". I liked the spin that the show gave the Maquis; instead of treating them as simple terrorists, we got a reason behind their treatment of Cardassia.
Of course, it also helped that in ""Voyager"" we got a strong cast of characters, including a female captain. The writing was interesting, as were the encounters with new alien races, including the Viidians (sp?) and our old favorites, the Borg.
I'm thrilled to see that Paramount finally got on the ball and decided to release this fine show on DVD. Can't wait to start collecting them.",1070582400,6,628,4.616071428571429
1968133,3,B000127LW2,"As the author of the fantasy epic Bloodspiller I appreciate good sci-fi when I view it. First, I do agree with many fans who say that ALL the dvd box sets are way over-priced. Baylon 5 ( the best sci-fi show of them all )and the equally fantastic Stargate Sg-1 boxsets are much more reasonable in price. However, I am too, a Star Trek fanatic, though I prefer Next Generation as my personal favorite with Voyager as the runner-up. The only problem with Voyager, as was with DS-9, was that it didn't become a great show until its third year. Not until Worf showed up in the former and the lovely 7 of 9 ( my main reason for watching the show )in the latter, did these shows gain an edge. And Voyager had to confiscate the Borg to generate its edge. If they decided to be a little less harmonious, they could have kept heat going by having the two factions, Star Fleet and Maqui ( which was taken from the French underground in WWII )at each others throats a bit longer in the storyline.  Even Janeway took away from Picard the "" foremost expert "" title regarding the Borg. I most enjoyed the Doctor, who with 7 of 9 eventually stole the show and took on the ""Data yearning to be human with Picard as his mentor in human affairs "" relationship. The problem with this show for me, was unlike Next Generation and eventually Ds9, they never really developed the characters in the show, which beyond the Holy Trinity, also happened in the original series. In NG every character changed over the years and became fully three dimensional people, and for this reason I am strongly and emotionally bonded to NG. Voyager ignored the potential of Chokoty, Tuvoc, Kim and others. They at least advanced Belana  and Tom slightly, but in the last three seasons totally concentrated on the Doctor and 7 of 9, almost to the point of shunting aside Janeway. The show in its first two seasons was as spotty  but thank goodness not almost as boring as Enterprise ( which only exists because UPN would be out of business without a Trek show  and demanded one to be aired and thus it's mediocrity ) until they adopted the Borg ( Holy Xindi, Batman! )and found 7 of 9. I  WILL buy the series, however -after passing over Ds9- if only for the pleasure of enjoying the Doctor's antics and to gaze at Jeri Ryan. Frankly, due to her scientific expertise, I don't think they ever would have gotten home....And why is Janeway now an admiral before they made one of Picard? At least he saved civilization dozens of times, and was instrumental in holding together with Worf the Klingon Empire, which if it had fragmented would have destabilized our corner of the galazy. All she did was get lost and luckily find her way home.",1070582400,,2695,4.480651731160896

My Lord! I would be willing to bet that the majority of the Voyager fans are not bringing in 6 figure incomes and would like to pay that price but ultimately will not be able to! :(

1968140,5,B000127LW2,"I was there ten years ago on January 16th 1995 as Star Trek Voyager premiered on the new UPN network to alot of press and hype. At The time, Trek was at it's height. TNG first movie Generations was a box office hit,and DS9  was into it's transitional third season. Voyager was important in the fact that it was to launch the UPN network,and most importantly the first Trek series to feature a female captain,Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).
 The premise of the show was Voyager originally pursuing a ship of Federation freedom fighting outlaws called the Maquis, only for both ships to be swept 70,000 light years away from Federation space. Both crews merged to work together to find a way home which would take seventy-five at maximum warp.
 The crew included Chakotay (Robert Beltran) the Native American Maquis commander who now serves as Voyager's XO,Tuvok (Tim Russ)the Vulcan chief of security,Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) a former convict now serving as Voyager's pilot,B'Ellana Torres (Roxanne Dawson)half Klingon former Maquis now Chief Engineer,Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) recent Starfleet graduate Ops officer, and""The Doctor"" (Robert Picardo)an emergency medical hologram now the CMO.Also along for the journey are two new members indiginous to the distant Delta Quadrant,Neelix (Ethan Phillips) who serves as ship's cook and guide,and his lover,Kes (Jennifer Lien)an Ocampa who's lifespan is only nine years.
 After airing probably the best ever Trek pilot ""Caretaker"",the show was an immediate hit,and the rest of the season contained some of the best ever episodes of the entire series,including The Phage(the debut of the organ harvesting Vidiians),Eye Of The Needle (Voyager making contact with a Romulan in the Alpha Quadrent),Prime Factors (the crew being on the opposoing end of the Prime Directive),Heroes and Demons (The Doctor rescues crew members trapped in a holodeck program of Beowulf),and Faces (Torres Klingon side is split from her human half).
  The most interesting episode is The Cloud. A humorous,delightful episode in which every crew member shines. Space anomoly aside,this episode showed more depth to the crew in one episode than the entire seven years.
 Originally,twenty episodes were filmed,but four were held for the second season. Although Voyager's quality was random in the later seasons,season one reminded us why we stayed with the show through thick and thin.",1069977600,7,2409,5.3403693931398415
8005472,4,B000127LW2,"I really enjoyed this season. It makes me wonder how I would react under similar circumstances. The captain can be strong and decisive while never ceasing to be a woman with feelings. I even like her long hair that it put in a bun most of the time but occasionally gets let down during personal moments. I really hate calling women sir. A woman can be a strong leader without denying who they are. Calling women leaders sir shows the world that women have to take on male pronouns in order to have strength and decisiveness or that if a woman is a strong leader she should want to give up being a woman and embrace the male pronouns. I think that the writers could have come up with a better last name, but I really enjoy watching Captain Janeway and the rest of the crew!",1524355200,,772,4.294520547945205

I have often thought what if this was a persons first introduction to the Star Trek franchise?  They would never get to enjoy all the rest of the fine series and movies. None of the characters pull you in. m. I think the problem starts with Janeway.  The lead HAS GOT to be compelling, she is not.  I understand how important they thought it was t have a woman captain.....but it just did not work. Not exactly sure why it failed so miserably.  I think maybe Kate Mulgrew  tried to copy the personality of Picard too closely. He was a bit brooding at times and that did not come over very well when she tried that in her character. Watching a couple of interviews with Kate Mulgrew I can see why they picked her for the part, .shes a strong woman with a strong personality. I think maybe it would have been better if she allowed a little more of HER own personality to come through in the roll. The problem started with her but she cant take all of the blame, the entire cast of characters are so bland and made it difficult to ""fall in love"" with any of them. Because I loved the franchise so much I kept trying and trying to like it, but just couldn't. At some point you have to just move on. .",1513036800,,1290,4.164658634538153

Strong character development and engaging stories, and in a lot of way truer to the old Trek in that there is more of a sense of discovery. It's not without its warts, and there were a few stupid episodes (has to be a holodeck episode, and the Paris falsely accused episode seemed like it was ripped off directly from a Cmdr. Riker plot from TNG.) The Phage aliens were a creepy bit of body horror with stealing organs and faces... a cringey twist from some of the previous Treks and it works well. Captain Janeway works but... her voice.... sometimes it's like listening to an irate squirrel. Her character is strong and believable but just something about her shrill voice.",1510876800,,827,4.671232876712328
