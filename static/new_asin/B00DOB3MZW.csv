As a parent, I enjoy listening to it (they have watched it in the van on long trips) because the plots are interesting and there isn't a lot of sassy talk, etc in it. My oldest daughter loves to read the Geronimo Stilton books and when I saw this DVD I thought I would give it a try. We were definitely NOT disappointed. It's a winner in our house and I can't wait for more of them to come out.",1386806400,2,564,3.8290598290598292
5838432,4,B00DOB3MZW,"Although my research has shown Geronimo Stilton to be highly popular all over the world, Operation ShufongFong was was our families first exposure to the show based on the renowned books.

The first time my kids watched the DVD, my five year old said he didn't like it and my four year old said she did. It's definitely completely different from the Disney shows they are used to watching and I think the international influences affect their opinions.

Geronimo Stilton is an action hero of sorts and he solves mysteries experiencing lots of adventures along the way. I guess Paige is more like me in that she loves a good mystery so I think that aspect appealed to her even though the characters are all older than her and their vocabulary was a bit over her head.

With unlikely sidekicks and quirky mysteries to solve, this DVD was truly unique. Even though Paige enjoyed watching all four episodes, I think it's definitely more age appropriate for upper elementary aged kids. It's well written and actually interesting for an adult to watch but definitely not for everyone.

Geronimo Stilton: Operation ShuFongFong was a nice departure from the usual shows that my kids watch and I actually appreciated it's uniqueness and introduction to mysteries for my kids that they will hopefully grow to love like I do!",1380844800,8,1314,4.826666666666667
