8286139,5,B001C6C4JG,"I recently purchased this DVD.  I had previously come upon the cover with only the first disk in it.  Had searched for sometime to locate a place where I could purchase the complete case and two disks.  Amazon was the answer.  I have since view and enjoyed it very much.  I recommend anyone wanting to know more about Joseph Smith and his mission to bring forth the Book of Mormon, to take the time to purchase this insightful message Susan Easton Black has presented to the public in general.
I for one was most touched by the way she presented the true story of Joseph.  A beautiful rendition, of a true story of a young man seeking to know which church he should join, prayed to God to know the answer.  Watch and understand what Joseph found out!!  You will be wondering too, as Joseph did prior to his prayer.  What a wonderful revelation!  LL",1412812800,,848,4.412903225806452
8286140,4,B001C6C4JG,"In this edited volume (Amazon appears to only be selling the DVD), thirty-three Latter-day Saint scholars examine the life and mission of Joseph Smith in thirty-nine essays. Enhanced by artwork from numerous artists, these essays are organized in a generally chronological fashion to inform readers how various events prepared Joseph for his greatest trials and accomplishments.

The companion DVD, available separately, features six episodes, currently being aired on television, highlighting different eras from Joseph's life.

In reflecting on the recent bicentennial year of the Prophet Joseph Smith's birth, readers can gain insights into the scriptural prophecies that foretold Joseph Smith's mission and even his name as well as the circumstances of the Smith family that drew them to the area of New York where Moroni had buried his sacred record.

Further topics include continuing revelations to the Prophet, the outward persecutions and internal struggles of the fledgling church, and the martyrdom of Joseph and his brother Hyrum. This book is intended to nourish testimonies of Joseph's works as a prophet and of the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.",1242864000,2,1167,5.472222222222222
