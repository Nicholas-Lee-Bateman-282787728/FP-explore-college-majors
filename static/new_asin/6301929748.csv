7817312,5,6301929748,"This is a moving and powerful movie. Everyone should see this movie, especially the times we live in today. I have the full lenght movie which is 208 minutes. Oh, why is this moving tape not on DVD?",1425772800,,198,4.2368421052631575
7817313,5,6301929748,"I have to agree completely with the review posted by MRT.  This is a very painful, poignant, true story of one of the great men of the 20th century; essential to watch; portrayed brilliantly by Ben Kingsley even better than The Pianist and Schindler's List; deserves to be on DVD!",1396656000,4,280,4.6
7817314,5,6301929748,"I do not understand why this movie about Simon Wiesenthal's bringing Holocaust criminals to justice is STILL not on DVD, unless those who will not make this possible are simply anti-semitic, or want us all to forget or deny that the Holocaust ever happened. What a shame.",1288051200,,271,4.787234042553192
7817315,4,6301929748,"A rarely referenced gem.  If you want to know a little about the real personal effects of the Holocaust, rent or buy this film.",1224115200,,127,4.291666666666667
7817316,5,6301929748,"I will never forget this film as long as I live.  I was fifteen years old the first time that I watched it.  I'd visited my fathers house for the summer and was sitting in the living room by myself watching a little ""cable"".  Having seen the trailer for it I was hooked and felt that it was something that I just had to see.  The afternoon it was broadcast I intentionally watched it all by myself.  I was moved to tears by the shear horror and sadness that I watched unfold onscreen.  It profoundly shaped my perception of right and wrong.  Imagine, all it took for this to happen was for good people to remain silent.  My parents both grew up in the Jim Crow south and probably couldn't care less about what happened to the Jews during world war II because of what was continuing to happen to blacks in this country.  I was never raised to feel empathy for these peoples.  Not to hate them, though certainly not to feel empathy for them.  Even so, I couldn't help but to be curious.  I wanted to know more about the holocaust.  Maybe it's different when you see it visualized onscreen.  There's something to be said for witnessing an event as opposed to hearing it word of mouth from another person.  One day I hope that someone will make a movie about the cruel injustices suffered by blacks in America.  As with the Jews, good people saw what was happening to blacks in America; Jim Crow laws legalizing discrimination, brutal lynchings and systematic raping of black young women by white southerners, denial of even constitutionally protected rights.  And as appalling as this was for many whites to see an entire nation remained silent for the most part to these injustices.  Just like the Germans, the Pols, the Czechs, the Austrians, and too many to name.  Cinema of this magnitude has the power to help others better empathize with those who have suffered so greatly.  It did for a teenager sitting in his fathers living room in 1989 watching a movie about the Jewish holocaust.  The power of visual story telling.  The magic of a movie.  And a message for all the world - Never Again...",1213833600,10,2096,4.51595744680851
7817317,5,6301929748,"This has got to be one of the most underrated & least known Holocaust films, and yet it has a first rate performance of an Oscar winning actor, Sir Ben Kingsley (also of Schindler's List).  This is the movie based on Simon Weisenthal's memoirs, one of the most coveted heros of our time.  GET THIS OUT ON DVD!!!!  This is a great film that was made for HBO, but the production values and the writing could have allowed it to be a major motion picture.  I put it up there with many great recent Holocaust and WWII films, such as ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist.""  This is an absolutely mezmorizing film and shows how Simon Weisenthal was rescued from a living hell when his concentration camp was liberated, and how he resolved with great courage to fight for the six million that can not fight back.  It also shows flashbacks to the horrors he survived during the years in the ghetto and concentration camps.  It also highlights how he helped the Israelis capture Eichmann.  Amazing footage, and superb acting.  The beginning of the film is especially moving as the Americans liberate the camp, and a we get a closeup of a soldier's reaction (Craig T. Nelson) as he comes face to face with the ""living dead"" that surround his entourage.  It's in slow motion, and very powerful, makes me cry each time I watch my old taped copy.",1188950400,21,1331,4.554621848739496
7817318,1,6301929748,"The reviews I read said it wasn't as good as the original.  As usual, they were wrong (in my opinion).  Good cast, good acting and a good story line.  Probably wasn't as politically correct as it should have been, but I go for quality, not others opinion.  Worth the watch.",1126828800,7,273,4.4
