2768942,4,B000NIBUSK,"Peter Sellers' greatness as a comedic and dramatic actor is shown here, with the bumbling actor who destroys a film and then a party in The Party, the marvelous spoof of the Bond movies in Casino Royale, the various plays on words and throughout them all the slapstick, which not all actors can get away with it... This is a good collection of great movie actors, including Niven and O'Toole, and the marvelous US and European actresses that intersperse these films.  Mostly fairly good comedy.  Unfortunately some of the color in What's New Pussycat is off, and the sound is not always good.  Some of these also seem to be missing lines.  Are we editing movies for political correctness? The Pink Panther is a work of genius...

Despite the flaws in the set, all in all, pretty good value for the money.",1356220800,4,804,4.633802816901408
2768943,5,B000NIBUSK,"Give this man a script, good or bad, and he can work miracles.  One of the, what I call, subtle actors that can take a line or a look and turn it into unbelievable proportions of perfection.  This DVD collection showcases his comedic timing, which is up there with the best of them.  Born with a face that can turn from stone to any emotional arena required, he is undoubtedly one of England's treasures and I am so glad he made it over to Hollywood.  I recommend any Peter Sellers movie for those looking for an in-depth actor with a heart of gold to the sublime antics of slapstick beyond the silent-era masters.",1331596800,,614,4.407079646017699
2768944,4,B000NIBUSK,This was exactly what I was expecting. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is because the corners of the box were dented a little bit which may or may not be the sellers fault. Otherwise the DVDs were in great condition.,1269561600,,224,4.113636363636363
2768945,3,B000NIBUSK,A bit dissapointing. Not as funny as I remembered or expected. I guess people change...,1239926400,,87,4.866666666666666

2768947,4,B000NIBUSK,"Though there are occasional exceptions, generally the best that comes out of a remake is a renewed appreciation of the original movie.  The Peter Sellers edition of the MGM Movie Legends Collection contains both an example of the rule and one of the exception.

First in the four disc set (chronologically) is The Pink Panther, the first movie with Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, this time on a seeming vacation at an Alpine ski resort.  He is actually out to catch the Phantom, a notorious cat burglar, who is after a gem called The Pink Panther owned by a princess.  David Niven plays the classy thief, with Robert Wagner as his nephew.  Though he has a major role, this is principally a Niven movie.  Interestingly, just as people would incorrectly associate the name Frankenstein with the monster instead of the scientist (or that Nick Charles was the Thin Man), many would assume that Clouseau was the Pink Panther.  This is a role Sellers would reprise several times and despite the efforts by Steve Martin in a remake, Sellers IS Clouseau.

Second is What's New Pussycat, in which Sellers is once again in a supporting role, this time as the psychiatrist treating Peter O'Toole, a man who attracts women too easily.  When he finally falls in love with a woman, his efforts at commitment keep getting derailed by a series of beautiful women.  Sellers is not so much interested in treatment but trying to use O'Toole's talents to snag some lovers of his own.  This movie, which also has Ursula Andress, Romy Schneider and, in his first movie, Woody Allen (who also wrote the screenplay), is more than a bit dated, but it picks up a lot towards the finish.

Casino Royale is the movie that is much superior in its 2006 remake.  The original cinematic version is actually a muddled parody which has its moments but also has all sorts of problems, probably not helped by the multiple directors.  Niven plays Bond, called out of retirement to stop a diabolical villain.  Sellers plays a card playing expert who takes the name of Bond to have a baccarat showdown with a Russian spy played by Orson Welles.  This film is filled with stars, including Andress and Allen again, John Huston, Deborah Kerr, William Holden and George Raft.  While some moments are brilliant, they are scattered and the end product is erratic.  A bonus on this disc is the 1950s made-for-TV version of Casino Royale that may not be that well made but at least has historic value.

Finally, there is The Party, the only movie in the set in which Sellers is truly the star, playing an actor from India who is accidentally invited to the party of a studio chief.  There is no real plot, just a series of humorous events as Sellers keeps getting involved in mishaps, which should be seen rather than merely related in a review.

All four of these movies are definitely in the style of the Swinging Sixties, which makes them both dated and all the more entertaining.  Even with their flaws, What's New Pussycat and Casino Royale are high three star and The Party and The Pink Panther each merit a high four or low five stars.  With a few extras, this is a nice four star set.  With his limited roles in three of the four movies, this may not be a Sellers showcase, but it still is a good collection.",1191628800,31,3269,4.625649913344887
2768948,5,B000NIBUSK,"This is a great cross section of Peter Sellers' films. Peter Sellers is well known as Inspector Clouseau as he first appeared in THE PINK PANTHER. My favorite here is WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT even though Sellers is not the main character. Peter Sellers character is that of the longhaired psychoanalyst Dr. Fritz Fassbender who is crazier than his patients. The office visit scene with Sellers and patient Peter O'Toole is a classic. Sellers' character in that film just so off-the-wall. THE PARTY is very. It surrounds around Sellers as a Hollywood extra mistakenly invited to a who's who wild house party. Sellers really makes this film work.  Sellers gets top billing in 1967's CASINO ROYALE filmed as a James Bond spoof rather than the genuine article. Essentially Sellers is chosen as a replacement (one of several) for the genuine James Bond (David Niven) who is now in retirement to play and defeat Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at baccarat at the Casino Royale. Sellers' role is actually small but still memorable. The laughs in CASINO ROYALE are hit and miss in this mixed bag with several directors at the helm that really lacks cohesion but still manages to amuse.

This set of films contains excellent scores from two brilliant composers. The inimitable Henry Mancini scored both THE PINK PANTHER and THE PARTY. Burt Bacharach, near the top of his game for capturing that wild innovative 60's sound scored both WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT and CASINO ROYALE which featured great recorded tunes for Tom Jones, Dusty Springfield and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.",1173916800,13,1559,4.969348659003831
