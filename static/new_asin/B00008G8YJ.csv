7983341,2,B00008G8YJ,"Aside from Tiny Tim (okay, I'm biased), this film is awful.  What a stupid story.  Who cares if this DVD is edited.  Believe me, it won't make a difference.  The edited scenes wouldn't save this film.  The acting in this is atrocious.  The plot is predictable and so is the ending.  The main character is a total idiot.  Go run off with Mervo already.  It would have made for a better story.  The sex/nude scenes are stupid and pointless.  There's nothing scary about this movie either.  It's laughable.  At least Tiny Tim gives a good performance.  He is the only reason this film is watchable.  The DVD does contain an extra bonus: the Incredible Tiny Tim Sideshow.  If your a fan of Tiny, you'll like the interview with Tiny",1440892800,3,727,4.51937984496124
7983342,5,B00008G8YJ,Everyone note that this is edited. but so is everyother copy. great quality transfer and packaging is cool. special features are worth getting this edition. the special feature is a documentary of the film plus a Tiny Tim video for his rerecording of tiptoe thru the tulips plus behind the scenes interview with Tiny Tim and an interview with Tiny Tim about music and his career. its worth it.,1327708800,,393,4.7101449275362315
7983343,3,B00008G8YJ,"Blood Harvest (Bill Rebane, 1987)

If ever there was a guy who seemed tailor-made to play in a horror film, that guy would be Tiny Tim. And yet it only ever happened once. Tim, touring the upper midwest, as was his won't (he died after a performance in Minnesota ten years later), was approached by schlockmesiter Bill Rebane after a concert in Wisconsin. Rebane had an idea for a horror movie into which he thought Tim would slot nicely, and the singer enthusiastically went along with it. The result is Blood Harvest (also released under the names Nightmare and The Marvelous Mervo), Tiny Tim's only performance in a horror film and--by far--the best movie ever turned out by Bill Rebane, the genius who also brought us such classic cinema as The Giant Spider Invasion (the film best known for having a visible VW bug under one of its spider props) and Monster-a-Go-Go!.

Tim, who's actually not one of the leads here, plays Mervo, the somewhat mentally handicapped son of a pair of lifelong farmers who've recently had their farm taken from them by the local bank. They're not the only ones, but they take it the hardest; the two of them end up committing suicide, sending Mervo's already-fragile mental state into complete disintegration. As a result, he winds up dressing like a clown for most of the movie and acting rather schizophrenic (though he never actually seems to hear voices, his odd topic changes in conversation are exactly the kind of thing one gets from a conversation with a schizophrenic). He's looked after by his brother, Gary (Dean West, whose only other big-screen appearance came in another Rebane joint). Gary is obviously affected by the death of his parents as well, but maybe he can put it behind him. See, his high school sweetheart, Jill (Itonia Salchek in her only screen appearance), is back home from college. Not that anyone wants her there; her father is the guy who's been employed by the bank to seize the property of delinquent farmers, which is pretty much everyone else in town. When Jill gets home, her parents are nowhere to be found, her best friend (Lori Minnetti, the only one of the principals in the film who still has a career) fears for her safety, and while Gary is perfectly willing to pick up where they left off, Jill has met someone at college and is now engaged. To make things just that much worse, a crazed killer starts preying on those closest to Jill, but doing it in such a way that no one around her, including the local sheriff (Frank Benson--again, in his only screen performance), can find any evidence that anyone's actually dying. Gary is skeptical, but willing to take her word for it. Can these young ex-lovebirds figure out who's killing Jill's pals before they end up on the platter?

I'm not sure how it happened, but Rebane and cohorts Ben Benson and Emil Joseph (neither of whom ever wrote for the big screen again; Benson was a novelist, while Joseph did some TV work much later in his career) actually came up with a script worth filming. In the wonderful world of Bill Rebane, a decent script is about as rare as a white rhino. I grant you, a lot of the acting here isn't all that great, but it's at least competent, also a rarity in Rebane films. And Tiny Tim? About as creepy as an overweight 6'1"" ukelele player in a clown outfit can possibly be. And while everything points to Mervo as the crazed killer, come on; part of the fun of the movie is knowing that it's way too obvious to actually be the case, and going ahead and trying to figure out who it really is. Rebane's script actually provides you with some interesting options in this regard, though he probably could have done more with a few of them; still, this is Bill Rebane we're talking about. Probably shouldn't demand too much from his atrophied directorial muscles. No, it's not what it could be, but for a Rebane picture, this is Oscar-quality, and well worth discovering if you don't already know about it. Casual film fans will consider it the worst thing they've ever seen. Slasher-film fans will know better. And, of course, it's an absolute must for fans of Tiny Tim. ** ",1263600000,2,4126,4.632513661202186

7983345,3,B00008G8YJ,"Unfortunately, this dvd version is cut. The previous reviewer is wrong though. In the US at least, no X rating exists, only NC-17. None of this really matters though since they are not trying to re-release this old film into theaters. It would be perfectly acceptable to market the uncut version on dvd as unrated as so many other films (even bigger hollywood releases) often are. Stores such as Wal-Mart probably wouldn't stock this title anyway, but I seriously doubt they would discriminate because of an unrated status (they sell other unrated films). Anyway, it's a shame that they would release the film so cut up. It makes you wonder what the hell people are thinking sometimes. It is common sense that the audience for such a film would want to see it uncut.",1147564800,8,766,4.723880597014926
7983346,4,B00008G8YJ,I loved this movie so much I have seen the original but I do know why the scenes where cut out for anybody who read the last review. They where going to relase it uncut but according to the new rating standards of movies with that much nudity it would of had an X-rating which would of cut down on its sales so they cut it down to an R-rating altough I do think it sould of been releced uncut I do see there point Wal-Mart would never market an X-Rated movie but they will an R(most wal-marts still won't carry Clockwork Orange).Anyway I hope this helps anybody in general its a great and veary disturbing movie and staring Tiny Tim makes it great on its own. So yeah if you can find a uncut copy get that but you don't lose that much on DVD,1077408000,3,741,4.082191780821918
