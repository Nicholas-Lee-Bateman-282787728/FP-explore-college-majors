5369982,5,B009W1VYFI,This live dvd is the funniest thing ive ever seen. Ive had it for like three weeks now and have watched it like four time all the way thru and every time i laugh and the documentary/back stage stuff. The live portion is awesome too. They play all my favorite songs and they sound just like they do on the record. I recommend any hair metal fan purchase this dvd!!!,1354838400,,364,4.214285714285714
5369983,4,B009W1VYFI,"Nothing beats seeing them in person, but this comes awfully close.

They are skilled musicians, Michael Starr (Ralph Saenz) is a talented singer, and they lampoon the hair metal genre as well as it can be done.

Not for the kiddies.",1354492800,2,232,4.634146341463414
5369984,4,B009W1VYFI,"Was looking forward to this DVD for a while.  The band does not disappoint, they are tight and burn through through the material.  They do nostalgia well but their chops will tell you they have the talent to be much more than a tribute circuit act. Too bad the show was filmed prior to the release of Balls Out but the second disc contains several tunes from that release.  The humor is laugh out loud funny but as with all sophomoric humor begins to burn out with one monologue after another between songs.  All in all, it's a great show, everything you'd expect from the Panther and worth picking up.",1352160000,2,602,4.445454545454545
5369985,5,B009W1VYFI,"HIGHLY recommend you wear a welder's mask and make sure your girlfriend/wife/farm-animal is gone for the weekend...still figuring out how to explain the intense burning sensation on my face, the remnants and scraps of ladies' undergarments laying around the living room, the smell of HairNet hair spray, trash can full of Jack Daniels bottles and chalk-like substance on all the glass surfaces in my house. Besides that, this DVD rocks more than Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Guns'n'Roses...combined...DEATH-TO-ALL-BUT-METAL!!!",1351641600,29,536,5.7125
5369986,5,B009W1VYFI,"Having seen Metal Shop/Metal Skool/Steel Panther well over 100 times, it's awesome that people who've never seen a Steel Panther show can get this DVD and experience a little piece of it.  This video is shot in high quality, with lots of cameras.  Definitely well done.  The only bummer, is this was shot before Balls Out....would have loved to have seen a bunch of songs from Balls Out.  I guess we'll just have to wait for the next DVD!",1351555200,11,438,4.506329113924051
5369987,5,B009W1VYFI,"The highly awaited DVD debut from Steel Panther...what more do you need to hear? Of course you need this in your DVD collection if you know anything about these guys. From their socially conscious lyrics-touching on a variety of topics including partying, drugs, and sluts-to their crazy backstage antics. This DVD will keep you somewhat content until they (hopefully) launch a complete US tour. Death to all but metal \m/ !!!",1351468800,10,426,5.014084507042254

If you've never heard of Steel Panther, check them out on YouTube (NOT AT WORK) and bask in the no-holes barred glory that is this band! I won't say too much, because I don't want to ruin the surprise, but if you enjoy 80's rock, funny and inappropriate lyrics, AND performed by pretty darn good musicians this is the band for you!

5370005,4,B009W1VYFI,"I love Steel Panther.  Whatever it is they is, I love it.  They're a tribute band and a parody band in equal amounts and it's just awesome.

This DVD is just silly fun.  The guys prove that they're the real deal live and play their asses off.  If you like Steel Panther and can endure too much stage banter, buy this DVD.  It just rocks.",1398556800,,337,4.107692307692307

YES BUY THIS DVD, IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS ALL OF THE STEEL PANTHER YOU CAN HANDLE.  VERY FUNNY DUDES.  IF YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.",1395100800,,291,3.913793103448276
5370009,5,B009W1VYFI,"I have watched this disc several times since receiving it last week, every time I'm amazed at how good these guys are. I'm a guitarist and a total ""Guitar Geek"". There are plenty of technically great guitarists around today but few who play solos that are truly memorable. ""Satchel"" (Russ Parrish) is a great guitarist, melodic with speed and great tone, his lead fills in ""Death to all but Metal"" put a big grin on my face. He has lit a fire under my butt to practice more and perfect my two-handed tapping technique, pretty cool for a guy in a ""joke band"".

The whole band are extremely talented, Micheal Starr has one of the best voices in hard rock period, he nails the high notes live, more than can be said for a lot of his ""serious"" peers. He never sounds wimpy and his David Lee Roth squeals are hilarious in a good way. The rhythm section is extremely solid, Lexxi Foxx portrays the ultimate poseur perfectly and Stix as the ""party animal""  drummer stereotype is priceless.

The Brixton show is amazing and I really hope ""Hell's on Fire"" will be on the next CD, that is a great song, joke or not. In fact all of the songs are so well written it makes the joke that much better and far more enjoyable for me than the original bands they are mocking. I really enjoy the ""heavier"" songs like ""Eyes of a Panther"", ""Death to all but Metal"" & ""Supersonic Sex Machine"", they remind me of how good Dokken would have been if they had a singer with some balls. The Download footage is amazing as well, both shows are well shot and the sound is great. The documentary is the icing on the cake and far funnier than even Spinal Tap, in my opinion. I have to wonder if these guys took comedy improv classes because they are just as talented in the comedy department as they are musically.

I should also mention that I am a ""Fundi-Metal-ist"", meaning I'm a purist (Metal has been my ""religion"" since 1983) and I instinctively hate ""hair bands"", I do NOT consider them ""Metal"" at all. I grew up in the 80s listening to the same bands I do today like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Celtic Frost, Slayer, Possessed, Mercyful Fate, Venom, Dio, etc. I couldn't stand the hair bands then and I still feel the same today. But I get the joke that Steel Panther is and the great musicianship combined with great comedic chops is really appreciated. If they won over a bitter old Metal Head like me they must be doing something right. I'll be seeing them on tour, already got my ticket. The Blu-Ray is a great package and worth every penny, highly recommended, even if you hate hair bands. \m/",1394928000,4,2589,4.421383647798742

5370011,5,B009W1VYFI,"Funny and talented, Steel Panther rocks! If you love 80's rock, or even if you just like good music, Steel Panther is such a musically talented band. Add in the raunchy lyrics and jokes between songs during the live set, and a good time is had by all. The DVD contains a complete concert, footage from a festival concert, and a mockumentary interview piece. Love this DVD!",1391817600,,372,4.567164179104478

5370018,5,B009W1VYFI,"If Weird Al and Spinal Tap had toured together with Motley Crue and Poison back in the day and had some illegidimate love children with some sleazy groupies then that would be the only way that the Boys of Steel Panther could have been brought into this world. Steel Panther has an Amazing 80s Sleazy Hair Band Sound that comes right out of the back of the tour buses or the back allies of the nightclubs. How could you not love that pure dirty sound. And with British Invasion Dvd you can see them playing live on stage and showing how Awesome a Band can be if they have paid their dues and worked their ways up from the shadows the back allies and slept with the skankiest groupies on Earth (And More Than Likely Still Are, YOU GO STEEL PANTHER!!!). Awesome Dvd!!! AAA+++",1369094400,,773,4.375
5370019,4,B009W1VYFI,"Excellent spoof of 80s hair bands. Excellent musicianship, and raucous humor! Most women will probably find this offensive. A must for people with dirty minds, a love of gross out humor, and fond memories of the 80s!",1366243200,,216,4.864864864864865
5370020,1,B009W1VYFI,"Although these guys play very well and can carry a nice beat, the song writing and the lyrics are just too cheap and immature for band members of this age.  There is excessive and tasteless use of sexual references and demeaning words towards women.  Unless this was a one-time-fun-project and the targeted audience is teenage kids, I don't see any future for this band.  Some of the band members were with Atomic Punks and without question they did a great job there, but definitely downgraded and lowered themselves to the lowest here.  I got the dvd/cd pack and the dvd is even worse.  DEFINITELY NOT TO BE WATCHED while children are around.  A lot of embarrasing moments, and guys doing and saying things that guys are not supposed to do.  It's a shame as they can really kick butt with the beat they can produce.  But all in all this is garbage music.",1366070400,2,856,4.549019607843137
5370021,5,B009W1VYFI,"i just saw it
the music is little bit like van halen and motley crue

in bonus 27 mn of the group play in august festival i think and we can see more boobs too much boobs

5370022,5,B009W1VYFI,The edited portion of their UK concert (only shows five songs) is the best footage I've ever seen of Steel Panther.  Steel Panther is so outrageous - it's hysterically funny.,1363910400,,174,4.8
5370023,5,B009W1VYFI,"Steel Panther brings back the magic of the hard and heavy of the 80`s greatest bands like Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Whitesnake with x-rated but funny lyrics that is a great event for adults.",1362441600,4,190,4.617647058823529
5370024,5,B009W1VYFI,"Having spent my teen years in the 80's, this band takes me back to the days of sex, drugs rock n roll and BIG HAIR. A must see if you like the hair bands of the 80's",1362182400,3,165,3.4864864864864864
5370025,5,B009W1VYFI,"I'm a huge Steel Panther fan and I just got this DVD yesterday. What an amazing , amazing, AMAZING show. I've been putting off seeing these guys in Vegas and after watching the DVD I won't put it off anymore.

I knew these guys were killer but after seeing this I'm even more in awe of the show they put on.

Very lewd, crude, and all around nasty which is AWESOME!!!!!!!

And yes....there is bewbs!!!!!!

Rock on Steel Panther dudes!!

1000000 stars for this dvd. Crisp and clear and loud and the camera work is top notch. Not a dizzy mess like alot of concert dvds.",1362096000,,567,4.311320754716981

5370028,5,B009W1VYFI,"So, most people might not like the shenanigans these guys promote, but from a playing music standpoint, if anyone is critical about them, they need their heads examined.  These guys are 10,000% spot on!  Sure they're over-the-top when it comes to the behavior....but ya know what....who cares, it's all about sex,drugs, and Rock'n'Roll!  If you've never heard/see these guys (youtube) them first, then Buy the DVD!",1360886400,3,414,5.242424242424242
5370029,5,B009W1VYFI,I live in Vegas and have seen Steel Panther play over 20 times (they used to play two shows a weekend).  I first thought of them as a novelty act and being that the tickets were free I had low expectations.  After seeing them play a few shows I realized these guys have real talent and are amazing entertainers.  In Vegas their shows are mostly covers from legendary bands. I enjoyed British Invasion because they played their original material which is a true mix of solid metal with hilarious lyrics.  If you don't mind a few foul words than this is a great dvd and I would recommend their 2 cds which this dvd gets the songs from.  So Turn Out the Lights and fire up your dvd player for a great concert experience.,1359417600,,717,4.32089552238806
5370030,5,B009W1VYFI,"Great tunes, great banter, greatest rock and roll documentary to date. Can't wait for their next one. I highly recommend this to anyone with a juvenile sense of humor. You'll love it.",1358899200,,183,4.75
5370031,5,B009W1VYFI,"With such a long wait for Steel Panther to finally release their first mass commercial DVD release, I cannot say enough about just how pleased that I am with this set.  Any true fan that follows Steel Panther will be amazed at how great this band sounds live.  They are truely an A(+) list act!
  The first disc is the heart and soul of what this collection is all about.  The full length Brixton Academy show is the best live show that I've never seen (YET!)...  I am so pumped from viewing this concert performance that I am actually planning a 2012 trip to Vegas with the fellas just to go get a live taste of the Panther action!  I have introduced all my friends to Steel Panther since my initial introduction back in 2008 and this DVD set is the absolute pinnacle in enjoying the full monty that Steel Panther offers, beyond going to see them live, I'm sure.
  The second disc is a great compliment with a mini show of sorts, taking choice excerpts from the 2011 Donnington show.  It is just as killer and displays the consistency of a great live act that will blow your mind and keep you laughin' just as hard.  A nice addition to the Brixton show...  Also included is a lengthy documentary of their antics that will keep you rollin' for a damn near hour long.  Be sure and check out the deleted scenes as well.
  Just as previous reviews have noted, be sure that the wife and kiddies are far from earshot, as they will only spoil the mood, let alone bring the time of your life to a sudden screeching halt.
  I have only one minor negative note concerning this set (otherwise I could be accused of simply wanting to get in the Panther groupie herd).  I was hoping for a music video (If You Really, Really Love Me) or maybe the entire short video catalog of theirs to be included.  Oh well, I guess you can't have it all in one?!  Hell, maybe there's more to come from the Panther on DVD from here.  I'll surely be in line to pickup my copy!  A+ rating here friends!!  ENJOY...",1357689600,4,1983,4.314363143631437

5370034,5,B009W1VYFI,"Having personally seen STEEL PANTHER live three times, once in Vegas and twice in Toronto, I can honestly say their performance on new DVD / Blu-Ray, British Invasion, takes their stage show to a whole new level. Disc one was filmed in 2010 at a sold out Brixton Academy in London, England. No less than 16 high-def cameras caught vocalist Michael Starr and co. adding strippers, blow-up dolls, pyro, giant foam Shockers, and confetti cannons to their already immensely enjoyable concert experience. In addition to dusting off the pre-Panther, METAL SKOOL tune `Hell's On Fire' and `We Want Pussy', bassist Lexxi Foxx lays down his mirror long enough to rock the hell out of the band's debut disc, Feel The Steel, in its entirety. The hilarity ensues almost immediately as set opener `Eyes Of A Panther' has the longest drawn-out ending, as if it was closing a third encore. Other highlights include guitarist Satchel fellating his microphone, and the lengthy, but comedic f-bomb laden speeches between songs. Disc Two houses the bonus features, consisting of ""Down And Dirty"" one-on-one interviews conducted backstage in the dressing rooms and during sound check, deleted scenes, and five songs captured live at Download 2012 in Donnington, England. Great contrast is provided as disc one showcased an indoor headlining gig, while disc two is an outdoor festival appearance with Steel Panther rocking three songs from their most recent album, 2011's Balls Out. The unadvertised highlight is SLIPKNOT and STONE SOUR vocalist Corey Taylor joining the Panther onstage to sing `Death To All But Metal'. And to make the package complete, a 16-page full colour booklet is included; now `Turn Out The Lights'.",1355788800,2,1703,5.1516245487364625
