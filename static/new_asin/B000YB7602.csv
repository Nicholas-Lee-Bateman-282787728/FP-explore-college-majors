8231743,5,B000YB7602,"This film tells us a story about a unfortunated writer, Marcos Villarreal (Arturo De Crdova), who wrote a romantic novel about a woman called Min. Accidentally, the book's title gave name to the just borned daughter of Vidal, friend and editor of Marcos. The Book became a successful top seller...

After some years and with the unexpected passed away of Vidal and his wife, Marcos became the tutor of Min (Irasema Dilian), a young girl who was studing in the U.S. and came down to Mxico to live in the Marcos' house. Soon by living together, they begin a passionate fun flirting, and sometimes dramatic romance between them, but with the intrigue and the jealousy intrusion of Marcos' assistent, Brbara (Mara Douglas). Finally all ends in an unexpected but good and romantic way for Min and Marcos.

As always, in this great performance of 1953, Arturo de Cordova is superb, full of emotion with hilarious moments. His partner, the lovely Irasema Dillian will just be breaking hearts again with her inocent beautifull eyes by her irresistible clever acting... Good Luck!",1207699200,3,1071,4.944444444444445
