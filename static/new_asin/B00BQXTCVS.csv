5667384,5,B00BQXTCVS,"I just recently watched this video. I bought it because I loved the actor in other movies and in the Game of Thrones. The series is about an ex-irish guard cop turned PI with a bit of a drinking problem. His talent is finding people and he eventually solves the crime. The series is at times dark, but is peppered with bits of humor. Worth every penny I paid for it.",1372982400,6,366,4.169014084507042
5667385,5,B00BQXTCVS,"I have always been a fan of Iain Glen, so I looked forward to viewing the first set of Jack Taylor.  I was not disappointed.  Jack keeps getting into situations that seem almost impossible to get out of, but he does manage to do so.  Make no mistake, this is very film noir, but the acting is superb and the stories are impelling.  Good choice.",1372636800,,344,4.246153846153846
5667386,4,B00BQXTCVS,"After watvhing the first episode -- drunk guy throughout, unintellible and ugly plot -- I was ready to throw the whole thing out, but had an unfilled window of time and watched the next two. Very good. Each episode is a new case to solve but within ongoing, connected contexts which explain Jack a good deal. And his drinking is commented on and he does it less. And -- he acquires a very helpful young, admiring  sidekick which he's smart enough to take on.
Another commenter reveals there are two more episodes in the first series; so, let's have them?",1372550400,3,554,4.54
5667387,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Intense suspense throughout. Ex-cop turned PI who investigates with wild action, deadly results, and passion on multiple fronts. Excellent writing of plot mixing in threads. Based on bestseller Ken Bruen novels. This guy investigates his own way, and usually gets a round of beating in each episode. He's tough, has to be, the crimes are ugly, and the solutions are amazingly woven together making it near impossible not to be surprised at the end. A solid support cast for Iain Glen (Downton Abbey) who shines as Jack Taylor.

Regulars include Sup. Clancy (Frank O'Sullivan); Cody the new partner (Killian Scott); Garda Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone), her partner DS Kavanagh (Nick Lee) & more. Also has guest stars. All you want in a good new tough Irish crime drama. And it's filmed in Galway, beautiful Connemara region.
SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 90-min episodes.

1 The Guards
4 young female suicides; but Jack's hired by a missing 18-yr-old girl's mom after being forced to resign from the Garda (Irish Cops). He's surviving as a Pvt. Eye and gets help from old pal Sutton (Ralph Brown). What's the mom's (Tara Breathnach) real motive? She seems suspicious. Father Malachy (Paraic Breathnach) also is a regular.

2 The Pikemen
Pikemen: vigilantes on the Galway streets, face-off with Taylor during a PvtEye investigation. Has Taylor crossed that fine line of law? A young follower, Cody, and old flame Ann (Tara Breathnach, seen in the 1st episode) complicate the almost sober ex-cop. The urban myth Pikemen frame Jack.

3 The Magdalen Martyrs
Taylor's hired to find Magdalen Laundries former nasty nun, ""Lucifer"", known for brutality to girls. Jack's warned off, the hard way, by Cassell (Liam Carney- `Angela's Ashes'), Irish drug baron. Facts get personal and Taylor again manages to get the cops and killers after his own hide. A twisted ending, to be sure.

There is a box warning about violence and language, but I can't wait for Set 2. Even better than ""Murphy's Law"", which was another good Irish cop series.

5667389,5,B00BQXTCVS,This set is great! It's my new favorite. I saw this set on Acorn T.V. and just love it. It is so well acted. The story telling is wonderful.

5667391,5,B00BQXTCVS,Another great BBC detective series.,1518566400,,35,6.2
5667392,3,B00BQXTCVS,"""Jack Taylor"" Series 1 is based on the gritty crime novels by Ken Bruen and was adapted for television by Ireland's TV3 in 2010-2011. ""Jack Taylor"" is Ireland's answer to Australia's ""Jack Irish"" or Scotland's ""Case Histories"", all crime dramas featuring heavy-drinking, barely functioning, detective protagonists with big hearts and a self-destructive appetite for trouble. Of those, Jack Taylor is the most appealing, thanks entirely to the charisma and velvet voice of Scottish actor Iain Glen in the title role. It isn't easy making a drunk charismatic, but Iain Glen often succeeds. The filmmakers use bits and pieces of voiceover narration, which makes good use of Glen's voice, but the voiceover is so sporadic that it feels awkward. A private investigator is called a ""finder"" in Ireland. Jack Taylor explains: ""The only thing I was ever good at in my life was finding things."" So a finder he is, after he is booted from the Garda Sochna, Ireland's national police force.

I don't know why it is fashionable to write stories about dysfunctional detectives. It used to be that the criminals were dysfunctional. The detectives were not. That's why the criminals were caught. Now the criminals are caught because they are hunted by an obsessive detective with nothing to lose. In the words of Taylor's client: ""They say you're good because you have nothing else in your life."" Nothing beside the bottle. Iain Glen does as well as anyone could with that, but he doesn't get any help from the preposterous plots. The crimes are often graphically and grotesquely violent. The behavior of neither Taylor nor the criminals makes sense. The crimes in the first two episodes are simply unbelievable. The mystery in ""The Guards"" isn't bad until the last 20 minutes of the film, which includes a bizarre twist and totally unbelievable behavior by everybody. ""The Magdalene Martyrs"" features marginally more believable crimes but relies on coincidences that defy credibility.

The 90-minute episodes are:

""The Guards"": Sgt. Jack Taylor is booted from the Garda Sochna after he assaults a cabinet minister, leaving him to wander the streets of Galway and drink. Out strolling with old military friend Sutton (Ralph Brown) who has found a second career as a painter, they come across the body of a young woman washed up on the beach the forth body to wash up in that spot in as many months, all considered suicides. When Taylor coms to the aid of rookie Garda Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone), he acquires a new friend on the force. A flirtacious woman calling herself Anne Hennessy (Tara Breathnach) implores Taylor to find her daughter Sarah, citing the suspicious number of young female suicides in Galway recently. Jack asks around and discovers that several of the dead young women worked in the same factory under the too-watchful gaze of a man named Ford (Bill Murphy).

""The Pikemen"": Jack returns to Galway after a year away to help old friend Mr. O'Shea (Eamonn Draper), whose son Niall (Robbie O'Brien) has fallen off a rooftop to his death. Galway boasts being the safest city in Ireland, as crimes rates have fallen precipitously in the past year. Rumor has it that the this is on account of a vigilante group that attacks and often maims suspected criminals. Jack pays a visit to Timothy Caffrey (Stuart Graham) who owns the building site Niall fell from. Niall used to work for Caffrey, who fired him for pilfering from petty cash. An attack on an old drinking buddy by men wielding a pike, an ancient military weapon that is a cross between a spear and an axe, confirms Jack's suspicions that Niall was the victim of vigilantes. Meanwhile, an eager young man named Cody Farraher (Killian Scott) aspires to be a ""finder"" himself and wants Jack to be his mentor.

""The Magdalene Martyrs"": Damien Flood (Nathan Reynolds), son of a retired Guard, is shot dead by a professional hit as he eats a burger, leaving everyone to wonder if it could be a case of mistaken identity. Maggie McCarthy (Darine Ni Dhonnchadha) hires Jack to learn the identity of an abusive nun who tormented her mother while she was confined to one of the Magdalene laundries for wayward young women 1960-1966, St. Monica's Laundry in Galway. Geraldine (Muirann Bird) kept a diary of her years there, discovered by her children after her death, in which the nun was called ""Lucifer."" Jack's eager, young partner Cody finds the records of St. Monica's from those years missing from the Church repository. Meanwhile, the protg (Conor Nolan) of local drug lord Bill Cassell (Liam Carney) is tailing Jack and threatening his life, and Jack's mother has something to tell him.",1514246400,,4645,4.934782608695652

5667395,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Beautiful.  Moving.  Touching. Brilliant acting. The Magdalene Sisters episode, a haunting history, was treated with exquisite delicacy. It exposes the tragic inheritance of torture under the guise of self - righteousness. The horror is passed on, generation to generation, with escalating suffering.  There is no expiation.  Each child a victim. Glen's acting is brilliant. He portrays the agonising slow understanding of what he experienced as the son of a victim. There is no forgiveness. Simply a circle complete of the good, the bad, the price paid for the evils perpetrated on the innocent.",1504915200,,596,5.376344086021505

5667401,5,B00BQXTCVS,"This is gritty! Not your usual detective and very flawed. As the shows progress he reveals more weaknesses and somehow changes how he interacts with others. While some think he has more than his share of reverses others still show their backs to him. He is a loyal fried and that is his greatest quality! He knows how to take care of himself but he is constantly being overwhelmed by those who do not want him investigating for those who have asked him to help them. The language is raw and there is more violence than sex. The humor is tongue in cheek and sophisticated. He is not always wise, he makes a lot of mistakes, stumbles through investigations but ends up with as much in formation as here needs but like life there always seems to be a lot of loose ends.

5667410,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Basically a known and time tested formula, but excellently done and very high production values.  Nice to see something that is Irish and done outside of England and with the focus on crime and policing in a nation other than Great Britain.  The British masterpieces are great and excellent, but ""Jack Taylor"" gives us a nice fresh perspective on Ireland.  Iain Glen is terrific.  So different from his character as the press newspaper lord in ""Downton Abbey.""",1488412800,5,460,4.935064935064935
5667411,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Have only viewed Season 1 with my Acorn subscription but looking forward to more.  The plots are strong, the acting is great.  I love to hate Jack Taylor's character - he is tough, gritty,unlikable most of the time and quite brilliant when sober. Occasionally, you get a poignant glimpse of his humanity.  As you progress through the episodes, more of what shaped Jack Taylor is revealed. I especially liked the hard-to-watch episode The Magdalen Martyrs, where we learn of Jack's mother's painful past..  Be prepared - Catholicism takes a hit in this series and justifiably so.  Filmed in Ireland - a welcome change!  I would love to see more series filmed in Ireland.  Loved the Red Rock series, 84 episodes of the Garda also set in Ireland.",1487894400,,743,4.803149606299213
5667412,3,B00BQXTCVS,"Not an accurate portrayal of Jack Taylor who while occasionally well intentioned is a human train wreck.  Ian Glen is too likeable...Jack Taylor is a bastard whose actions are selfish, irresponsible and irredeemable.  Although some of his acts border on noble, his trail is also strewn with the broken hearts of his ardent followers.  Bruen's genius is that you can't stop hoping that Jack might just justify your belief in him.",1487289600,5,428,5.0
5667413,4,B00BQXTCVS,"My yardstick for a good show is whether or not it can keep me on the treadmill for 60 minutes.  Shows like Broadchurch, Line of Duty, and The Fall kept me on there for 90 minutes some days.  Shows like The Hinterland, which got great critic reviews were so slow I almost nodded off during my workout! Yes, this show is full of cliches, and I do tire of the attacks (although justified) of the Catholic church in Ireland), Iain Glenn's performance carries the show.  And it gets better and better.  The plots become more engrossing and you learn more about why Jack is the way he is.  I found the storyline about his mother (The Magdelens) very poignant.  I really like this program.  Hope they keep producing it.",1486771200,,712,4.4728682170542635

5667417,5,B00BQXTCVS,"This is one terrific series.  It has the classic Sherlock/Watson duo, but the Sherlock is a raffish black sheep who can blarney with the best of them, except he is also brilliant and sensitive, when he's sober, that is.  Iain Glen embodies him to perfection.  The Watson character is more of a wannabe, but rings some changes on the Beta Male's role.  Although many British detective shows feature all classes and all accents, and may be set anywhere in England, Scotland and Wales, this is one series set not only just in Ireland, but in Galway, which is apparently the Irish Podunk.  The plots are twisty, and keep you guessing until the final moments, and the characters are fully fleshed out--for good or ill.  Breathtaking scenery, charismatic star, brilliant ensemble acting, and the deliberate absence of leprechauns, Druids, and the Celtic twilight: bottom of the mornin' t' ye!",1484784000,,886,4.952702702702703

5667434,4,B00BQXTCVS,"Enjoyed it a lot. but is it possible to ever have a detective with a death wish who doesn't drink himself into a coma and does all sorts of stupid things he later regrets, especially when the people around him are the ones who pay?  Jack (is there any detective NOT called Jack these days) is good hearted but he looked like a used tea bag most of the time and gets in his own way. Iain Glen does his best with what he has to work with but the accent slips a lot. Plus he is constantly getting thumped and his performances can be a bit over the top. Worth a look because he is generally such a good actor and anyone who likes him as Jorah on Game of Thrones will enjoy this.
I loved the scenery of Galway town and the surrounding land and seascapes.
The storylines were interesting-a bit preditable only in that if you don't go for the obvious choice, then you have to go for a less obvious alternative, and the clock is ticking on each episode.  Series 1 and 2 are both very good, so worth a watch.",1467763200,8,999,4.1179487179487175

5667446,1,B00BQXTCVS,"I have only watched the first ""episode"" or ""film"" and thought it a very weak plot.  Acting isn't bad but the script is very weak. Production is also very poor.  An example: Jack finds a revolver hidden in a hotel room.  The revolver is silver (chrome or stainless steel). Later the same revolver is shown and it is blued.  It also changes in cuts from the same scene from having a vented barrel (like a Colt Python) to a non-vented barreled revolver.  This is one example of the whole convoluted mess.  I don't have very high standards for action movies or television shows but unless you drink as much as Jack then I think you will find this very weak beer.  I may watch the second show to see if it improves.",1452643200,2,710,4.333333333333333
5667447,5,B00BQXTCVS,Most of the dramas having police characters in a mystery setting are very predictable.  NOT Jack Taylor.

5667451,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Twenty years or so ago in Stratford, I saw Iain Glen in Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" (as Henry) and in an affecting and unusual production of the rarely-performed ""The Broken Heart"" by John Ford, a younger contemporary of Shakespeare.  I've kept an eye out for him ever since, and perhaps for sentimental reasons, I thoroughly enjoyed his work in these three television dramas, based on novels by Ken Bruen that I haven't read -- so I have no opinion on the question of whether or not they are well-adapted.  To me, they work well on their own terms.  I have to admit that I'm a sucker for the Jack Taylor kind of character -- a bit like Ian Rankin's John Rebus, except that Taylor is no longer working as a policeman but as a PI, though he still has contacts in the Galway force -- some who trust him, and some who don't.  His relation with a young woman officer, Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone) is consistent across the episodes, and, despite a considerable age difference, there's a nice vibe between them that is part-romantic and part pedagogic, without ever resolving itself simply into one or the other.  In Episodes 2 and 3, Taylor acquires, initially reluctantly, an idealistic young male helper, Cody Farraher (Killian Scott), who, like Noonan, turns out to be more resourceful and capable than Jack initially is willing to admit.

Taylor is to Galway as Rebus is to Edinburgh -- and the camerawork is nice throughout -- but the problems and the action are more rooted in the Irish culture than Rebus's are in the Scots culture.  The Catholic Church is a presence especially in Episode 3, ""The Magdalen Martyrs,"" which is the most compelling of this first series and which touches Jack more deeply than even ""The Pikemen,"" in which he also turns out to have a personal stake.  There's an almost Gothic quality to the plots, and while procedurally the plotting is solid, the creation of atmosphere -- of repression, guilt, escapes into alcohol, and the weight of the past (both personal and cultural) -- is clearly important to the filmmakers.  Glen is splendid as Taylor -- the edge of despair doesn't overwhelm his basic decency and idealism, and by the end of the third episode, we have acquired a pretty good understanding of how he came to be who he is.  Also, he's not Superman -- he's not young any more and sometimes bites off more than he can chew and pays a price. The supporting actors are very good too.  You'll notice that I'm saying nothing about the details of the plots.  They all involve people treating others with degrees of cruelty that go beyond what they might or might not deserve, and Taylor, not wanting to create more damage than necessary, is delicately conscious of being reluctant  to explain too much to some of his clients as he wraps up his investigations.  So . . . there are familiar elements here: the humane but damaged and troubled hero, this time with an Irish twist.  Recommended.",1430870400,,2921,4.677734375

5667459,4,B00BQXTCVS,"TV crime thrillers have gotten better over the years. Crime lab tools, cell phones, forensics etc. have helped make them more sophisticated. Add to that some good characters and you end up with this well worth seeing series.

Here's the scoop. Jack Taylor is kicked off the Garda force for punching out a politician. Now he works as a private dick. His reputation for success brings him work. But his propensity toward self destruction gets in his way. We follow him as he works on solving various cases.

Iain Glen, as Jack Taylor, is what makes this series. He is an interesting character. He drinks too much, rubs people the wrong way and has a generally screw-you attitude. But he's an incessant reader and really smart and observant. He seems to have retained much of what he's read throughout his life. And he has a near unwavering sense of right and wrong. He'll often stay in a case for as much personal reasons as for whatever money he stands to make. The cases are usually grim. They'll involve not just murder, but often brutal murder. They are also very clever (sometimes a bit too much so) which is good and bad. There seems to be almost a formula to the way they're structured. Of the six episodes I saw you could almost set your watch to how things would unfold. I could tell by the remaining time in an episode if Taylor was on the right track or if there would be another twist.

That being said, this is still a heck of a series. The side characters are pretty good. The writing is consistent as is the directing and other production qualities. If you like crime/mystery thrillers, this is well worth your time.",1413158400,,1629,4.534013605442177

5667470,3,B00BQXTCVS,"This is a series that has escaped me. I am a mystery/police procedural buff, so finally took a look. Jack Taylor is a rough, tough Irishman, who looks the part of someone in trouble.

Iain Glen plays, Jack Taylor, a new private detective, after being 'let go' from the Garda. In Galway there is not much to do, and with his old Garda long wool coat, Taylor seems to pick up the rough stuff of crimes. Sometimes he walks into the midst of a crime, or sometimes he saves a damsel in distress. Whatever occurs, the scruffy Taylor always looks like he just rolled out of bed. His body must be bruised and torn after the beatings, gunshots and miscellaneous harm he comes into. His clients are often the downtrodden and those who need his help the most, so he dies have some redeeming values.

I did find it difficult to sit through an entire episode without fast forwarding at times. The pace is often slow, the storylines similar in nature. The redeeming feature is the sights and sounds of Galway.

5667473,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Jack Taylor (US Region DVD) stars Iain Glen as the eponymous anti-hero of Ken Bruen's long-running mystery series.  Taylor's a disgraced ex-Garda living in Galway, having been booted from the force for his disregard of the rules of police procedure, drunkenness, uncompromising and irascible behavior and particularly for slugging an Irish politician (deservedly so).  The first series consists of 3 separate but related episodes based on the books The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs.

I won't run through the plots of the episodes, since they have been extensively analyzed by others.  Mostly shot in and around Galway (with some limited interiors shot in Germany), the Taylor series makes the most of the beautiful, rainy and moody Irish city and its environs. Glen (a Scot, by the way), gets Taylor just right.  He convincingly shows us Taylor's fundamental decency and commitment to helping those who need it, all the while aware of his personal failings and the price he -- and his friends and allies -- always pay for his actions.

The series is not without its faults.  Chief among them is the need to provide a more rigid plot structure that moves things along.  This is understandable, but loses a fair bit of the narrative lyricism of Bruen's written work, which does a much better job of conveying Taylor's own internal dialogue.  Relationships are streamlined and made more conventional; Garda Kate Noonan seems to be a composite of at least two of the characters in the novels, particularly Garda Ridge.  Though well played by the striking Nora-Jane Noone, the romantic tension seems a bit forced, and Garda Noonan ends up spending most of her time telling Jack to leave her alone because he's bad for her career (he is) while turning around the next minute and helping him out.  One wishes more time was devoted to Jack's tortured relationship with his mother, beautifully played by Aine Ni Mhuiri, who harbors deep secrets of her own that come to light in the Magdalen Martyrs.  In her brief screen time, Aine Ni Mhuiri creates one of the more memorable characters I've seen in many a year; she gives an acting master class in which her eyes and a soft touch convey more than pages of dialogue delivered by a lesser talent ever could.

Devoted Bruen fans -- and I am certainly among them -- may well have trouble with the television series.  In the end, like even the less than best of the books (Purgatory, in my view), the series is still far better than most.  Give it a chance and you won't regret it.",1408147200,,2535,4.795402298850575

5667480,5,B00BQXTCVS,"This review was written for set 2 but I thought it might be helpful for set 1.  If you have Netscape streaming video you will find that they have all 6 episodes marked as S1, instead of S1 for the first 3 and S2  for the second 3.  It could be that the S stands for series not set or something else.  The reason that I included the review for set 1 is that some of you might want to consider some of the benefits of streaming video, at least for the Jack Taylor videos.

The series is great. However if you watched Jack Taylor on Netflix streaming video you would have seen all 6 episodes. Which turns out is set one and two. I was watching the last 3 Jack Taylor videos, on Netflix, the same month that they were being released on DVD. Netflix streaming video lists all 6 videos as S1. So I thought that set 2 videos were new ones that I hadn't seen which they were not. In fact since Netflix streaming video is only $8 per month with a free month you might want to consider signing up for Netflix instead of buying set 1 and 2 of Jack Taylor for a total of $73.69.",1404777600,,1066,4.033175355450237

5667483,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Iain Glens Jack Taylor is a an ex-cop in Galway.  Jack drinks too much, smokes too much and gets beat up way too often.  He clings to his old Garda overcoat, even though he is no longer authorized to wear it.  The locals come to him to investigate cases and he is characteristically paid in rumpled cash, stuffed in an envelope.

The cases are very gritty, the story lines dark and compelling.  While Jack eventually acquires a sidekick and has a friend within the Guards, he is essentially alone.  Alienated from his mother, the only constant source of warmth in his life is his elderly landlady and a few bartenders.

The shows are feature-length films replete with Galway atmospherics and Galway culture.  The third show in the first series echoes the film Philomena.  It concerns the lot of bad girls working in a laundry generations ago and being tormented by an evil nun they term Lucifer.  Another show features a group of Galway vigilantes, seeking violent justice whenever the Guards are unable to secure a more civilized version.

Viewers will remember Iain Glen from both Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey.  He is an ambidextrous actor capable of playing a multiplicity of roles and types.

This is an excellent series but it is dark, strong medicine.  Were in Vera and Dalziel and Pascoe territory here, not Midsomer Murders.

Highly recommended.",1400889600,,1358,4.843478260869565
5667484,4,B00BQXTCVS,"Jack Taylor is not unlike dozens of burnt-out-ex-cop-turned-private-detectives weve seen before in films and TV. Even the Irish setting (which does add a lot of colour and character) has been explored before (Single Handed). So what is it that distinguishes Taylor from so many other purveyors of law and order? To be honest, Im not sure. This is the problem with JACK TAYLOR.

Aside from familiarity there is the added problem that Jack Taylor isn't particularly likeable, especially when he makes sexually suggestive remarks to teenaged schoolgirls. The whole beaten-down-by-the-world, poetically tragic Irishman would get tiresome very quickly were it not for the lynchpin performance of Iain Glen (who is actually Scottish). Glen is a handsome man playing against his looks and for that alone he deserves considerable credit. Its the character that counts, flawed though he may be.

The stories are good, with excellent production values and supporting performances. If there is a problem with JACK TAYLOR it is simply that there are an awful lot of policemen/detectives on TV and to stand out there needs to be something to distinguish the main actor and the premise of the show from all the others. Im not sure I even LIKE Jack Taylor.

There is something interesting about the man and his tragic fall (he was a policeman who left the Guard under trying circumstances). He is certainly a flawed hero (if he is, in fact, heroic). About the only qualifications he has for heroism are his honesty and determination to find the truth.

Of the three feature-length episodes packaged here, the third, The Magdelen Murders, is by far the best and does the best job of developing Taylors character and explaining his motivations. It is this episode which promises there may be more than was initially on display with this series.

The verdict is still out on JACK TAYLOR, but while there may be enough interest to warrant spending more time with him in further episodes, he, and the program that bears his name, are light years away from being in the same league as a Tommy Murphy, George Gently or Tom (or even John) Barnaby.

5667486,5,B00BQXTCVS,"I saw the first episode a while ago and didn't like the program--it seemed contrived and cliched. However my sister, a fan of the series, urged me to keep going and I'm happy that I did.

First let me say that I can't think of a more versatile actor working today than Iain Glen. From Lordly to louche, he seems to be able to inhabit all sorts of characters. As Jack Taylor, a former policeman in the Irish Guards turned private investigator, even the timbre of his voice seems to have changed along with his accent--and is redolent of booze and cigarettes. Taylor has a lot of wounds stemming from childhood--and as he says at one point, 'I'm an Irish male, I deal with things by repressing them.' And by drinking like a fish.

In the first episode Taylor gets involved with a beautiful femme fatale [ who hires him to find her daughter] after he is fired from the Gardai for assaulting a local politician.

In the second, returning from a years absence to Galway he gets involved in an investigation surrounding the suspicious death of a man who has fallen off a building site and finds himself pursued both by the police and a vigilante group run amok. Along the way he picks up an enthusiastic young sidekick.

The third episode is best, involving gross abuses in a Magdalene laundry facility where young women were interned, and during which the hidden past touches Taylor's life in a most personal way. Unlike some viewers, I did not find the events to be contrived or too coincidental --I always enjoy stories where lives cross and crisscross and seemingly random events turn out to be intertwined [ I looked up Galway and the population is about 77,000 --so it is not inconceivable that many people's paths have converged at some point].

Interesting locations, good supporting cast and another stand out characterization/ performance by Glen. If you only know him from Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey, check out his earlier work in the incredible Bob Raphelson film Mountains of the Moon about the Burton-Speke expedition to discover the source of the Nile; as an intellectual gay drug addict in Painted Lady and as a gangster in Prisoner's Wives.

Jack Irish, which is, ironically, set in Australia!

We've enjoyed both of the series - which are quite a bit different than American serials in that there seems to be more story-lines going on all at once, more action - we found this particularly true with Jack Irish - which we LOVED! Jack Taylor was a little more low key, but ran along a similar vein - a former ""cop"" who was had to leave due to things he did while drinking. Now working as a P.I. (or ""finder""), Jack is willing to push any limits - which makes him appealing to clients, and he'll take cases the cops won't look at, or put on the back burner.  Jack's cases that take him into some of the rougher areas of Galaway in Ireland - the scenery is real - which is a real bonus. Viewing some of the foreign serials has been interesting for that reason alone - getting to see how things are done in other countries, and Jack Taylor is very well acted - something you'll be looking forward to seeing more of once you see one DVD!

The Jack Taylor series is based on the novels by Ken Bruen.

A heavy drinker and smoker; short tempered and tersely worded, Jack is indeed an anti-hero.  I had watched all of the six episodes on-line before I got the chance to receive this set and I had already fallen in love with this unique view of Irish life.

5667498,3,B00BQXTCVS,"I've been spending quite a bit of time lately watching UK crime dramas. Sherlock, Luther, Broadchurch - all quite fantastic shows. So I was hoping for a bit more of the same with Jack Taylor. And it's good, but not quite as good as the others I've mentioned.

Taylor is an ex-guard, fired for hitting a politician, with a drinking problem. While the cliches don't end with that initial premise, Iain Glen's portrayal of the flawed protagonist kept me watching through all three films, and I'm glad I did - the second and third installments were both better than the initial outing, which felt to be trying a bit to hard to define Taylor's character all at once, as opposed to letting it unfold naturally over time.

But that's not too much to put up with for the payoff of a pretty good group of films. The settings are fantastic, it's well shot, and the I've always been a sucker for a characters that actually have human failings and struggles.

In the end, Glen doesn't quite pull of amazing performance that David Tennants turned in as Alec Hardy, but Jack Taylor isn't Broadchurch either. But if you're looking for a gritty UK-based mystery series with fine acting and and an enjoyable group of stories (particularly the last two), this might just be your cuppa.",1387324800,,1267,4.647321428571429
5667499,4,B00BQXTCVS,"This isn't a TV series, per se.  It's a set of TV movies, the first three out of six to be exact.  So don't buy this expecting to get a TV series, because you'll probably be disappointed.  That said, the stories do have a fair amount of continuity from one to the other, so if you watch them out of order, you'll be missing out on bits of the character's life and his relationships with others.

That said, Jack Taylor is a set of really good neo-noir crime movies set in Galway, Ireland.  Jack used to be a member of the Garda, the local police force, until he lost his temper with a well-connected politician and then lost his job.  He hung on to his Garda coat, however, a snazzy blue number, and their attempts to get it back form a small running joke in the movies.  The movies, taken from a series of books by Ken Bruen, are quite interesting.  Jack takes up private eye work, and investigates a series of murders of young women, a local vigilante group, and tracks down a really evil former nun nicknamed ""Lucifer"" by the young women forced into her care.  Along the way, he drinks a lot (something of a cliche), tries to deal with his mother and the priest who looks out for her, cultivates a source in the Garda, and acquires a young sidekick who worships the ground Jack walks on.

Iain Glen is fantastic, and the supporting cast is equally wonderful in their roles.  Each movie is about 90 minutes long, so I suggest carving out a chunk of time when you can just sit down and watch them one at a time.  They are quite absorbing.",1387324800,2,1539,4.305555555555555
5667500,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Jack Taylor, a Galway native, is an ex-guard who is haunted by things in his past. Working as a private detective, Jack is known for pushing the limits and not always walking on the correct side of the law to get things done. He's brutal, passionate, and imbibes way more than he should, but he is serious in finding out the truth.

The first DVD, ""The Guards"" sets up the series. It seemed to move slower than I would have liked, but I'm glad I didn't judge the series on this one. The next two are totally captivating and so well done that I didn't really figure out who did what until the end. Unlike many other detective shows, this one really kept me guessing all the way through.

Each DVD is around 90 minutes - the length of a movie, and immerses you in the world of Ireland - the world we usually don't see. Full of action and red herrings, this series is great for those who like a more tense and brutal thriller. With the language and violence, it is not for the faint of heart. Many scenes are realistically graphic.

I adored Jack Taylor. He's haunted, broken and really doesn't have a lot to lose. He risks everything to get the job done. In this series, Jack is played by Iain Glen (Game of Thrones) and he does his part very well.

Highly recommended for mature viewers who don't mind graphic violence and those that like ""guy action films"".

There are only three movies in this set and they progressively worked out the kinks and it became a more solid addition to the noir world. That trend left me with a more positive forecast of the rest of the series than I started with.

There's as much drinking in this series as a 70s US TV sitcom. Foul language and blood spirts, too, but not excessove nudity for those who keep track of such things.

Cinematography was interesting in that it was mostly urban, you don't see as much of lush, sweeping countryside that is usually in movies related to Ireland. Still a treat. There's a scene in one of the episodes shot under a bridge or something looking out at what would usually be considered the cute village of Galway. It's a short but very spooky, noirish shot that made for a moody scene which is difficult with color instead of black and white. Little things like that perked up the show.

One thing that concerned me was that all of the voices seemed a bit muddled. I don't know if that was a technical issue or just the way my ears heard the accents.",1386115200,,1164,4.425233644859813
5667503,3,B00BQXTCVS,"I was very excited to watch this series for the first time.  The troubled ex-cop working as a sort of undercover private investigator while battling his own demons is always a grand plot for a crime noir series.  Having never even heard of the series I went into it as a blank slate.

I did enjoy much of the acting - I find Iain Glen to be superb in the role of the title character Jack Taylor.  Many of the secondary characters are fairly well acted though not up to par with his performance.  I did find that some of the lesser parts were overacted as if they were cast from the local theater without tempering the performance for film.

The scenery is beautiful and very interesting to watch (It's nice to see things that don't take place in NYC or LA every once in a while).

The directing is good though not stellar.  The writing is 75% of the way there... each episode you will find characters talking in a more literary fashion than an actual dialog fashion - which brings me to what I liked the least... the Voice overs.  I found them for the most part to be completely unnecessary and detracted quite a bit from the actual story telling.

This series includes three DVD's with a full length episode (the length of a film) on each.  Apparently there were more episodes in the season but only the first three are included here.  I'm assuming there will be a set 2 with the missing episodes.

If you haven't seen the series each episode is essentially a full length film following Jack Taylor as he investigates and solves a series of murders that the local cops don't seem to be able to get a handle on.  He does it through manhandling the filthier end of society and drinking his way through his problems.  The victims he champions tend to be people the rest of society either looks down upon or simply forgets exists.  True to the genera there are several red herrings and the actual baddie isn't discovered until the end though he has often been there all along.  The series is dark, gritty and not for the kiddies, the stories are interesting though not exactly new material.  I found these to be worth the watch, though not something I was moved enough to purchase on my own.",1386028800,,2188,4.4275
5667504,4,B00BQXTCVS,"I applaud Australian studios for trying to get series distributed in the US. My only complaint is that compared to the current (very excellent) selection of UK suspense and mystery (most notably Sherlock and Foyle's War imo), this series falls a little short. Though Iain Glen is very good (as he was in Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones), the writing is decent and the show seems a bit contrived.

Still, if you are a fan of a decent, modern day suspense/mystery then this might be a series you could enjoy. The American series are more easily digestible and more obviously entertaining, the British series seem to be a bit more understated and slower. The Australian series tend to fall somewhere in between. Hope that helps!",1386028800,,727,4.76984126984127

Iain Glen is believable in the role of Jack Taylor. He gets beat up, doesn't carry a gun, is kind to most people, and is a pretty reluctant detective in the first two movies. He has some absolute gems in his lines. He does a voice over which explains what he's thinking throughout the movies, it works for really developing the character.

The mysteries themselves are dark. The criminals are creepy and disturbed. The movies focus on both the mysteries and on the main character's relationships with his family, friends and neighbors.  The Galway setting and Iain Glen save these films from cliche.",1386028800,,839,4.655405405405405

I was hoping for a Jack Reacher-like appeal whose character I was also not familiar with but after seeing the movie one book was based on this past year, went on to read 9 of the novels in that series and though somewhat similar, greatly enjoy and appreciated them as page turning past times.

5667508,4,B00BQXTCVS,"I have enjoyed several Irish made-for-tv series in the past and this one is no exception. The Jack Taylor series was an entertaining ""who done it"". Iain Glenn is a great actor, very believable and charismatic as a tough ex-Gardai turned private detective, a strong-silent stereotype. The beautiful Galway scenery co-stars in this series, and several of the supporting cast turn in admirable performances. Some of the plots follow a predictable path, but somehow the charm of the Irish makes them new and fresh. Jack angered the local constable, had a loyal sidekick, got beat up in every series, and had difficulty relating to his women friends, but there was always a plot twist at the end. The twists made the show entertaining; however the fact that Jack seems to get badly beaten up in every episode but seems to bounce back by the end of each story strains credibility. The current Garda officers are all portrayed as crooked dimwits, with of course gives Jack Taylor the opportunity to be heroic in every episode.",1385856000,,1019,4.862068965517241
5667519,5,B00BQXTCVS,"While the Anglosphere has been developing a seemingly limitless appetite for Scandinavian thriller writers, we've been overlooking an equally delicious Irish noir author : Ken Bruen.  His Jack Taylor series features a seedy private 'op who has been dumped from the Garda, but maintains his connections within and without the law, as well as his comfy uniform coat.  Not only are the books good but there's a fine tv series based on them that, as far as I can tell, is not shown on any channel here in the US.  Happily you can now get the DVDs and they're well weorth it.  The cases Jack investigates are as grim as it gets, but Iain Glen brings a scampish touch to the role and he's got a comic sidekick who idolizes him and longs to be his Watson, or Robin to his Batman.  The brutality and the comedy don't always mix well, but do keep the shows from becoming overbearing.",1385856000,2,874,4.471698113207547

For instance, The Guards purports to be about four young women who've committed suicide.  That story seems to just fall by the wayside as Jack becomes involved with a woman who claims her daughter is missing.  The problem is I ended up caring more about the original suicide story than I did about this woman and her issues.",1385856000,,618,4.857142857142857
5667521,5,B00BQXTCVS,"The Jack Taylor series is interesting in the way that detective movies are. Iain Glen's character puts me in mind of Tom Sellecks Jesse Stone movies. Older guy doing Private Eye battling the bottle, but that's where the similarities end.

Jack Taylors bouts with drinking become extreme at times, to the point of black out and all of it plays into the story. This series, based on the crime thrillers by Ken Bruen, consists of three discs for the first set, each one just over 90 minutes.
 There is some narration by Iain Glen, and a very strong Irish dialect, which you should expect, since the stories take place in Galway, Ireland. It helped me to leave subtitles on to reference if I didn't quite catch what they said.

Each disc stands on its own as a a self contained tale. But if you watch all three, you will see the characters that over lap. I really enjoyed the development of the characters, and how Jack Taylor gets chosen to look into a case. I found Taylor likable and believable. The cinematography is absolutely amazing.
I recommend this to people to who like watching the unwinding of mysteries, P.I. stories, or international crime shows. I enjoyed these very much.",1385769600,,1183,4.650717703349282
5667522,4,B00BQXTCVS,"Oh I so wanted to really love this series. I love private eye books/films and this just seemed so perfect: the interesting area of Galway, Ireland as a backdrop, a former Irish Guard as the lead character, a great lead actor. But while I really wanted to just become a raving fan of this series, all I can truthfully say is that the episodes are pretty good--but they have some flaws.

First of all, the series is about a former Irish Guard (I had to look that up on Wikipedia to find out the significance--and it's worth reading about that organization if you're going to watch this series) named Jack Taylor. Taylor was tossed out of the force and seems to have made more than his share of enemies, both in and out of the Guard, along the way. The anger between him and his former partner (and now a supervisor of some kind) seems a bit contrived to me and it seems like it was just inserted to create tension between the protagonist and his past. OK, that's a common device, I have no real problem with it, but the writers just beat it to death in each of these three episodes. It gets a little tiring. (There's a kind of long-running thing about a coat he never returned when he was tossed from the Guard that I still don't get the importance of--big deal, he stole a coat, who cares! Move on.) Also, is there a private eye in existence that doesn't have a drinking problem? Can someone invent a new problem for one of them?

There are three full episodes in this set and, as I said, the backdrop of Galway is pretty interesting. I have never been to Ireland (though I've flown over it, lol) and so to see a city like this as a backdrop is fun. Also, Iain Glen is a superb actor (and it's to his credit that I'm giving this set four stars instead of three--his acting is great) and he really has created a deeply believable character.

So what is the source of my overall disappointment? Mostly it's the writing. In the first episode several young girls turn up drowned (suicides?) in the harbor. Then out of the blue a woman approaches Taylor and says her daughter is missing--but is not among the dead. Can he help her find the daughter? This is where the plot stumbles: first, how did she really find him? There's some nonsense about his artist buddy that makes no sense to me and her seeing a painting of Taylor, etc. Then she hands him a wad of cash for his services--but he doesn't even count it and shoves it in his pocket. What? And then, not long after, he ends up having a romantic entanglement with the mother. It all seems very invented and obvious. The artist/friend becomes a larger element in the plot but the connections between all of the characters just seemed strained to me.

The second episode is even more convoluted and unexplained and I nearly shut it off. But in this episode a sidekick named Cody is introduced and, thankfully, he saves the episode (and the series, to be honest). I actually found myself alternately rewinding obsessively to hear what they were saying (thick accents and I hate subtitles) and fast forwarding because the plot was so slow and thick with coincidence.

But I stuck with it--and I'm glad that I did. Episode #3 is the winner. This episode explains a lot of Jack's past and his family life (his mother is a major character in this episode), Cody is back and there is a great connection to the Magdalene Sisters--a group of young girls who were essentially turned into slaves and tortured by nuns in Ireland. A fascinating connection to a real (and dark) part of Ireland's history. There was a film made about the Magdalene Sisters:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magdalene-Sisters/dp/B00018D3L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magdalene Sisters</a>&nbsp;and it is absolutely worth watching--a difficult film to watch, but brilliant.

This episode is great. The actors all have upped their game, the writers seem to have found their pace and the story, as I said, has a strong connection to historical events. I loved this last episode.

So, I give the series four stars, though part of me wants to keep it to three. Let's call it 3.5. But Glen is such a superb actor and the last episode is so powerful, that I am giving the series the benefit of the doubt. As one other reviewer said (his review is excellent, by the way), Robert B. Parker's (RIP, Robert) ""Jesse Stone"" series is a far more articulate and engaging series on all counts:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesse-Stone-The-Complete-Set/dp/B00D2D1WVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesse Stone: The Complete Set</a>

Is this worth watching? Absolutely, if you like a good mystery and can overlook the flaws (and the thick accents), it's pretty fun. Is it great? No, not even close. But Iain Glen is great--and he's worth watching.",1385769600,,4837,4.812274368231047
5667523,3,B00BQXTCVS,"Before every fan swarms me with negativity for giving 3/5 stars, let me give up a disclaimer and say that I was unaware of a Jack Taylor literary character, let alone TV film series, before having the opportunity to review the first movie set.  I do not know anything about the books but, as I learned after seeing Ender's Game in at the cinema today without having read the print version, the books should not matter to the general audience as just the movie need to be good (enjoyed Ender's Game BTW).  I have seen other made-for-TV films from crime novels, most notably the Jesse Stone films and enjoyed every one of them so that's the closest comparison I have.

Now, I'm going to be brutally honest: I only made it through the first film, half-way through the second, and couldn't go any further from there.  Between the poor pacing, confusing narration, and the film taking the bold step of not including the audience in some of the detective deductions, the audience I was watching with and myself just couldn't justify spending another two hours or so watching the last half of The Pikemen and starting/finishing The Magdelan Martyrs.  I thought it would be great for review purposes if I brought in my parents, little brother ( aged 24), his girlfriend, and two buddies of mine to spend a whole evening eating popcorn and watching a Jack Taylor marathon as every person in the room had very unique tastes and standards.  However, despite the eclectic tastes surrounding the man cave that is the theater room we all, universally, found the series confusing and my parents fell asleep.

Here's why we didn't like it.

The pacing was atrocious.  It felt as though more time was being spent with minor details or by driving home Taylor's drinking habits too much (we get it!  He's a drunkard!).  The films also tend to make tremendous deduction jumps without explaining them.  For instance, Taylor is investigating the disappearance of a girl and makes a tremendous leap of faith from having little luck while doing leg work and checking the word on the street to seeing girls with matching tote bags sporting a local company logo and *light bulb* SOMETHING SINISTER even though the girls he interviews that he made the evil corporation connection with didn't even know the girl who vanished.  I remember I had to pause the film because my brother spoke up and said, ""WTF, how'd he make THAT connection?!""  We all then tried to figure it out ourselves and, believing it would be better explained later on, resumed the film.  While Taylor's assertion was correct, his deduction wasn't explained leaving us completely baffled.  Taylor made other deductions from almost nothing throughout the film and didn't have the common courtesy to explain things even in the overly done narration, which gave more philosophical zing-zangers than moving the plot along.  If anything, the narration made the films harder to follow.

Both films we watched, albeit did not finish the second one, continued to hopscotch throughout the plot and make very loosed connection that just baffled us and it wasn't due to our inability to fully understand the Irish accent, either.  We were able to understand enough of what the actors were trying to say, and they did a good job in their portrayals, but nothing they said helped alleviate our confusion.  It's like reading a crime novel with whole chapters missing and not even the boring ones but the ones integral to the plot.  It made the films unwatchable.

Now, this next section covers the seemingly fundamental flaws in the plots themselves.  Throughout the films, when our whole audience was awake and coherent, many of us made various observations of obvious plot holes and unlikely character actions.  Now, granted, I've never been to Ireland and I know next to nothing about their culture and customs, but I'd like to think that some things are common sense such as...

1:  Evil corporate bossman has cameras everywhere in his plant to 'watch' his workers and uses them constantly, except on his outside doors when Taylor and psychotic drinking buddy break in at night
2:  In same evil corporate HQ of devil worshipers, the bossman of pure evil employs off-duty cops for security and even has them attack Taylor to shut him up... except for aforementioned scene where Taylor and friend break in and confront the former BP executive that probably clubs baby seals for fun.  Now, if I were an evil corporate dictator that ran a sweatshop for young girls and other criminal activities that I won't discuss to reveal the plot, I would have security there at ALL HOURS!  Hell, even the local Super Target has a asset protection security officer monitor cameras when the store is closed.  Not to mention everyone else seems to have a gun in Ireland except the bad guys.  Villains in the Jack Taylor universe need to stop watching Saturday morning cartoons and invest a little illegal money in some good ol' fashioned firearms and a full-time private security force.
3:  Jack Taylor, after hearing grave news about a friend, goes on an evening drinking binge and wakes up a few days later.  Now, I'm no doctor but I've NEVER heard of a person passing out for more then 12 hours unless they had alcohol poisoning and that would require immediate medical attention.  Taylor would not have been out as long as he was unless his mother's remedy for drunkenness was Ambien.
4:  At the very beginning, Taylor sports a navy double-button overcoat that, apparently, he got as a cop and never returned.  The superintendent and local ""guard"" office send him numerous notes reminding him to return the coat in an almost running gag.  Now, at one point Taylor is passed out in his apartment and his former partner, now superintendent, shows up to talk to him but not before looking at the coat hung up on the wall and mentions, ""I'll start by taking this back,"" but he never takes the coat but makes repeated efforts to try and take it back (unsuccessfully) later.  Maybe he forgot, but I was expecting a subplot of Taylor trying to get it back and, when I saw Taylor sporting the coat in the next scene, I knew that wasn't going to happen.

I can go on, but I'll wait for the Cinema Sins video and you get the idea.

After we gave the film series a rest, we conversed about what we thought and not one of us enjoyed them.  They were boring, put some of us to sleep, and made too many jumps without explaining them to the audience.  I was ready for nonsensical exposition at that point!

From the general audience perspective, this isn't a very good series as I would recommend Jesse Stone films instead.  To fans, I'm sure they're fun but, to the rest of us, the books don't/shouldn't matter.",1385596800,3,6714,4.740963855421687

Jack is an interesting and likable in his way, but the story itself was surreal to me. In Ireland they don't know about fingerprints? All murders are washed away if you through the body in the river? I just couldn't connect to it. Plus, the story is partially acted and partially told in voice overs. This made me feel I was missing bits that I would have known if I read the books.

The DVD contains three 90 minute episodes. Taylor is an alcoholic former ""Guards"" person who makes a living as a private eye handling strange and unusual cases.

The first episode introduces Jack and how he gets involved in the hunt for a serial killer. The pacing for this one was rather tedious and I was ready to write off Jack as a stereotypical ""down on his luck drunk ex-cop who later redeems himself through solving cases nobody else can do."" Thankfully the series picks up steam with the second episode and by the third (involving a sadistic nun), I was fully engaged and interested.

The photography in all three is stunning and the viewer gets to see the streets of Galway, post-Celtic Tiger prosperity, which is great, since this is a city I've rarely seen depicted in films or TV.

The second episode ""The Pikemen"" introduces a sidekick of sorts that's at least likeable but even he isn't enough to save the series from an overly grim tone. It's  better than the first but that may also be due to lowered expectations.

 Set in Galway, disgraced ex-Guard (cop) Jack Taylor takes on the job of ""finder"". He's basically a private eye, but since there's no such thing as a private eye in Ireland,  this is just one more way he bucks the system that disused him.

Problems with friends, alcohol, old Guards and even his mother, Jack's intentions are always admirable. However, his flaws always get in his own way.

5667537,2,B00BQXTCVS,"Like Iain Glen as an actor.....He's great in ""ABBEY"",""THRONES"" and others....He's good in this...This just not up to usual BBC/FOREIGN standard that i expect...Totally predictable, and i just wanted to slap him/Jack Taylor/protagonist~instead of actually feeling ""something"" for this character, which i suppose is ""feeling"" something...
He's whiny,dirty,irritating,boring~ and the other main characters are miscast, just MY OPINION.....The antagonist is a bufoon, the leading love interest blah............
  Sorry Iain, you're still the man.
Watch something like, hmmmmmm, ""CASE HISTORIES"" instead.",1382745600,,599,6.475

5667551,5,B00BQXTCVS,I really liked Jack Taylor.  The actor playing the homeless guy standing in line for food behind Jack Taylor did an amazinf job.  I felt he could really be homeless.  Someone should discover this great actor.,1380672000,,208,4.722222222222222
5667552,3,B00BQXTCVS,"When Jack Taylor (Iain Glen) puts on his stolen regulation double-breasted Garda coat with the brass buttons, watch out!  Jack Taylor is Ken Bruen's fictional detective/private eye/finder. He has been dismissed from the Garda Sochna (Irish police) and is now finding things for people in Galway, Ireland. The Irish call their gumshoes ""finders"" since ""private eye"" sounds too much like ""informer""...

Three 90-minute films are in this first collection: they were filmed in 2010-2011 and directed by Stuart Orme.

""The Guards"" introduces Jack Taylor and is based on the debut series novel by Ken Bruen. After his dismissal from the Garda, Taylor finds refuge in a local boarding house and frequents a nearby pub.  A worried mother hires him to find her missing 18-year-old daughter after a series of apparent suicides have left four young girls drugged and drowned in Galway Bay. Taylor receives some assistance from a fellow Garda named Kate Noonan and Superintendent Clancy (Frank O'Sullivan).

 ""The Pikemen"" is a yarn written in Bruen's Hibernian noir style and characterization. It is a typical vigilante story about eight men who wear black hoods, kill with pikes, and have a twisted sense of who deserves to live and who deserves to die. The story includes a nave young man Cody Farraher who sees Jack as a hero, the best ""finder"" in western Ireland.  Taylor is arrested on suspicion of murdering a local businessman and is forced to rely on Cody to help clear his name.

""The Magdalen Martyrs"" returns to Bruen's gritty and brutal storytelling and is adapted from his novel of the same name.  Taylor (with Cody's help) is hired to look into past abuses at the infamous Magdalen laundry, the city's home for ""wayward girls.""  The daughter of a former inmate wants him to track down a woman called ""Lucifer""...a particularly brutal nun who worked there in the 1960s. Jack discovers a 50-year-old family secret that leads him to the nun's identity and an unexpected connection to the recent deaths of two brothers.

Jack Taylor in the Bruen books is a loner...just an alcoholic Galway gumshoe who finds tinkers and Mary Magdalen's and flops often in his room at a local boarding house.  Iain Glen, although a Scotsman, gets his t'inks and t'anks pronounced in good Irish fashion and, thanks to other surrounding cast members, portrays Taylor well.  The addition of young Cody Farraher (Killian Scott) and beautiful wide-eyed Garda Kate Noonan (Nora-Jane Noone) as regulars in the series is very nice.  Even Mrs. Bailey, the owner of the boarding house and an example of the ""old school of Galway charm,"" softens our intrepid ex-Garda loner.

Galwegian Ken Bruen sets his Jack Taylor books smack in the middle of Galway, Ireland.  The settings of the television productions purport to be Ireland but are filmed a goodly bit in Bremen, Germany.  Jack does not sober up and wander down to the Great Southern Hotel (now the Meyrick Hotel) near Eyre Square nor to the greatest bookstore in the world (Kenny's) around the corner on High Street.  But many of the scenes are filmed in Galway's Claddagh area where the Corrib River runs into Galway Bay and are spectacular.

Fortunately, the third film in this collection is pure Bruen...and the dialogue is sharp, swift, and blackly comic.  Too bad one has to sit through three hours of introduction and a boring vigilante tale to discover the ""real"" Bruen.  But stay tuned and prepare to download the next two installments of the true Jack Taylor films based on the novels:  THE PRIEST and THE DRAMATIST were both released in the UK by Acorn productions in March of 2013 and should be available on Amazon USA shortly.",1380326400,16,3664,4.923577235772358
5667553,5,B00BQXTCVS,"I've owned this set, for less than a month. I have watch every episode at least 10 times. O.K. maybe five time each...",1379116800,,118,4.173913043478261
5667554,3,B00BQXTCVS,"Probably the best thing that ""Jack Taylor"" has going for it is Iain Glenn.  He's a great actor, very believable and charismatic as a gruff ex-Gardai turned ""finder"" (which is the apparent term for private detective in Ireland).  Other pluses include the beautiful Galway scenery and some of the supporting cast like the very appealing Nora-Jane Noone who plays Kate, one of Jack's Gardai friends and potential love interest.  Some of the cinematography and action scenes are also well done.

But what keeps me from giving it more than three stars is the fact that the plots are all very predictable and rarely spring any surprises on the viewer.  They've all been done to death in all the cop and private detective shows in the US and UK...the only thing new is the fact that everyone here is speaking in Irish accents.

Also certain things happen that strain belief...like Jack getting badly beaten up in what seems like every episode (and once hit by a car) but being pretty much good as new by the end of each story.  Another cliche is that with the exception of Kate, all the Gardai officers are depicted as either corrupt or a dimwits who need old Jack to somehow solve the case for them...and who inevitably tell Kate to ""stay away from Jack Taylor"" ...which she never does.

So I would rate it a solid three stars...which translates in my book to being a good time waster but it doesn't rise to the same level as police and private detective series like Midsomer Murders, Touch of Frost, Inspector Lynley, Morse, Inspector Lewis, and Poirot.",1378944000,5,1548,4.686346863468635
5667555,5,B00BQXTCVS,"From beginning to end, this is a spellbinding series!  All five episodes were real life, and completely believable. Every character especially ""Jack Taylor"", Kate Noone, & ""Cody"" kept us interested all the way through!
The Galway city background is so enjoyable, just adding to the authenticity..
WE ARE HANGING ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEATS.. FOR MORE EPISODES!! Especially... What happens to ""Cody"", after he was shot!!!
This series needs much more EXPOSURE.. I thought Downton Abbey was great, JACK TAYLOR is on the same page!!!!

5667557,5,B00BQXTCVS,"I wanted to see what else Mr. Glen could do, other than being ""the exiled knight"" in Game of Thrones... Guess what? If anybody likes British Television, Film, whatever, this fits the bill. It's grittier than what we are used to over here on the other side of the
Pond. And as far as sensitivity goes, the guy isn't ashamed to show it. ... Give it a go.",1377820800,,352,4.1911764705882355
5667558,3,B00BQXTCVS,"I like the actors, especially the main character. Stories are well plotted, with lots of twists. However, the last episode (The Priest) was way too twisted and dark. SPOILERS - It wasn't enough for the priest to be a violent pedophile - he also rapes a nun and gets her pregnant, then goes after the boy conceived by the rape. Other boys he rapes grow up to become perverts and rapists. Enough perversion, right? No - a main character is doing the Borgia thing with his sister. It gets worse, but I can't write more without totally giving away all the plot twists. Very disturbing.",1377388800,2,581,4.542857142857143
5667569,5,B00BQXTCVS,"Watching the series, most of the action seems to happen between Eyre Square, down Shop Street, down to the Quays, the docks, the Spanish Parade, and over to the Claddagh and Nimmo's Pier.  With occasional side tracks to Nun's Island, the Cathedral, the old court house, and Woodquay (for a good view of the Cathedral).  OK.  All of central Galway.  It's where I grew up, and it's in my soul.  It's a pity Hertridges hasn't come up.

For myself, just like Jack, my first library experience was in the library above the courts, in the old court house across the bridge from the Cathedral.  I well remember the Magdalene Laundry.  Across from it, there was an area next to the train station where livestock were traded.

Etc., etc.

I'm not really contributing anything, I suppose, except to say that I enjoyed the acting of the series, but was more taken with the changes to Galway, which is the background.  I found myself trying to frame the town I remember into the city that exists.  It's a sort of dazing and exciting experience.  I remember when Galway was a great, but very poor, sort of place.  I love so much to see it built up and prosperous.

Sorry.  I'm having a schmaltzy moment.  Galway was a great place to grow up, so the show could be nothing but garbage being moved to the dump out on the Tuam Road, and I'd likely still love it.",1376784000,2,1345,4.44672131147541
5667570,5,B00BQXTCVS,"If you like gritty atmospheric British mysteries, this series delivers. Jack Taylor is a renegade, former ""guard"" in Galway, Ireland. The background setting of this seaside town of Ireland provides a lot of the charm of the series. Jack is down and out, helping families of victims of crime. He has a soft heart for the underdog.

He doesn't play by the rules, but he's effective. I don't know how he's still standing, the number of times he gets attacked, but he always lives to fight and drink another day. Aiding him is an attractive and smart female cop, a sympathetic chief of police who cuts him slack when he can, and he teams up with a fun and smart sidekick in episode two. He also has a very understanding landlady. The dialogue is colorful and witty. There is a lot of profanity and some graphic violence in every show, but the acting is terrific and Ireland is a delight. Wonderful cinematography.

Based on the novels by Ken Bruen, the plots are original. If you didn't like the first show in this series, keep watching as the second one is better.",1376092800,,1061,4.549738219895288

5667573,4,B00BQXTCVS,"This is a good enjoyable crime show. The stories are interesting and the acting, especially Iain Glen in the lead is great. I certainly recommend it.

The only part that was disappointing to me is that the lead character does not develop at all thru the 5 episodes; same struggle with his drinking demon, no meaningful relationships etc. He is good looking and has a likeable personality, but the viewers don't really get to know anything about him or his past.

I also would have liked to see other Irish cultural elements besides the standard stereotypes of hard drinking men and sex crimes of the Catholic priests.",1375228800,3,617,4.757009345794392

8572851,5,B00BQXTCVS,I loved this series.  Iain Glen is wonderful as Jack Taylor.  You can almost feel the dirt of the sidewalks and the hard lives that he saves.  Seems that all detectives drink too much and live in squalor.  Not sure why that is but the fact that he swiped the warm coat from the police says he was cold and making a point.
