I like this dvd in first place because you can find most of the

Keystone stuff wich are hard to find. I know the quality is not good but if you're interested in Chaplin earliest films i doubt

you can find it with a better quality nowadays. I also like this dvd because you can choose if you want to hear the original soundtrack or the sound of the old reelers. The presentation is cool too. Recomended for those who want to find the Chaplin Keystone reels.",1151452800,13,473,4.292134831460674
