8048245,3,B0007LFPIE,"A modest Canadian schlock film, but like Plan 9 from Outer Space it's beauty comes from its cheapness. Its a fun romp, though always remember it's a schlock film then again it tends to remind you of that fact.",1380758400,,209,4.384615384615385
8048246,5,B0007LFPIE,"Picked this one up at the local video store back in the 80's.  My friends and I had no idea what was in store for us.  WOW!  What an awesome surprise.  We had accidentally found our own personal cult classic.  If you're a fan of wacky low budget cinema then THIS is for you.  It's a comedy horror sci fi ..................................MUSICAL!!!!!!!!  It's AWESOME!  I don't want to spoil it by giving away the plot.  That doesn't matter anyway.  Discover it like I did in highschool and have a blast.  If you like weird and wonderful movies you WILL love BIG MEAT EATER!!!

8048247,4,B0007LFPIE,"The film is a lower-budget type of Rocky Horror show without the sexual content and  with less music. There is definitely some sarcasm within it, regarding small-town naivete, notions of science from the 50's, particularly where related to space, and, last but not least, the joining of space flight with a super-souped-up version of a teen's ideal toy-a car! The picture, apart from its craziness and the bizarre persona of Abdullah, seemed highly prophetic at times, and on hearing the Bagdad Boogie for the umpteenth time, I visualized Dubya, Cheney and Rumsfeld in drag in place of the dancing girls. This is for anyone and everyone tired of American reality. Try it, accompanied by some sedating liquid and quiet surroundings.",1330905600,2,731,5.091666666666667
8048248,5,B0007LFPIE,"A musical.  A genius kid.  A butcher.  A weird plot.  Better special effects than Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Best of all, the songs and dancing are well done.  Very highly recommended.  I couldn't stop grinning!",1247702400,,210,4.666666666666667
8048249,4,B0007LFPIE,"When I finally get around to mentioning ""The Big Meat Eater"", to people who are finally in my circle of movie friends (whom I number very few), I always say that it's the Canadian Rocky Horror.  Strangely catchy musical numbers, very low budget special effects, and so many plots it should be 6 movies, a couple classic characters, this movie has it all.  Bear in mind this was the 80's, but if you loved Repo-man, you should find something to smile (or groan) about in this slice of z grade cinema.",1132531200,6,499,4.472527472527473
