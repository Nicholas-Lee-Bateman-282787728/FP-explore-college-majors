This one is simple enough to follow if you don't have great coordination skills. It will still leave you sweating and panting.

You can make it a more intense workout by using heavier weights and going into the lunges more or you can stay light which is nice. You will use your whole body. I have not done the ab section  or the cool down stretch parts because I do that on my own. It's a fun workout that I will probably do for a long time.",1272412800,,647,3.9692307692307693

2988800,5,B000WOSAV0,"I'm a fan of Kathy Smith workouts, everything from the Lifting Weights video to the Total Body Lift to the belly dance foray.

This I consider to be her best: it flows along well, the moves seem interesting and are pleasant to do, the workout can be made more or less challenging depending on the weights you choose; and I like the separate core workout which can follow the standing one if you're up for it.  A bonus workout is even more challenging.  The stretching session is also very good.

This is a grower:  it's fun, it doesn't get stale, and it really works the bod.  I use it a lot.
Terrific!",1268352000,3,602,4.330357142857143
2988801,5,B000WOSAV0,"I purchased this workout a couple days ago and just did this workout this morning. I was very impressed overall!

I'm a certified personal trainer who is also an avid collector of fitness dvds (a couple hundred at least). As a trainer I think it's important to stay fresh and continue to see what others are doing and dvds are one of many excellent ways to get exposure to a wide variety of approaches and concepts.

One thing I really respect about Kathy Smith is that she not only puts out consistently strong products, but she isn't afraid to get input from others (such as Angela Freeman in this dvd, Rod Stryker in her Yoga Series, Keith Cook for Kickboxing etc.). Not only that, but she often has those same folks in her actual projects and gives credit where credit is due! (this is not as common as one might think).

This program is definitely for an intermediate and beyond exerciser. This is because there are complex movements involved that require a lot of neuromuscular coordination and if someone isn't already experienced with training they definitely might be risking injury.

 It's very important to have an awareness of what is safe for your specific body. There are some movements that might be contraindicated for you and you will need to know how to modify. Even though I'm a fitness professional and very fit,  I was in a car wreck many years ago that led me to have cervical spine surgery. As a result of both the injury and surgery, there are certain types of overhead movements that are unsafe for me to perform. I'm fortunate in that I have the knowledge to know how to modify or completely substitute movements. Someone without that experience might get themselves into trouble. While this should apply to any workout program, this particular program would certainly bear that out. This isn't a criticism of the dvd, which I think is great, but it's still an important consideration.

For example, this program contains multi-directional lunges (which are also combined with upper body movements). Front lunges in particular put a novice exerciser at the risk for placing too much shear force against their knees. With my own clients I always start with more stationary types of lunges (in fact I start with Yoga poses such as the various Warrior poses) and then move into reverse lunges in order to learn proper alignment and get a better inner feeling of the movements (kinesthetic awareness) before moving into forward lunge type movements.

For those who have done programs like P90X this program would be in the same general category as something like Core Synergistics. The exercises are different but the concept is very similar which is: multiplaner, multijoint, combination movements. What this means is that you might combine a rotating lunge with a row or press, so you are moving in a variety of directions with various combinations of lower and upper body movements at the same time.

This program definitely includes a lot of lower body work overall, squats and plies are present in addition to the lunges already mentioned.

There are also periods of ""speed"" work where you build into quick shuffle movements which are great for getting your heart rate up and also for working the muscles in a side to side pattern (in what is technically called the `Frontal Plane').

This dvd is broken up into sections and has the main workout, a core section and a flexibility section as well.

I particularly like the fact that the core section doesn't contain crunches. This falls in line with the cutting edge type of research done by people like Stuart McGill (a low back expert) who believe that repeated spinal flexion causes too much trauma to the intervertebral discs. Several exercises shown on this dvd are planks, side planks and bird-dog exercises which are considered by most knowledgeable trainers to be safe core exercises which not only do not aggravate the spine but in fact strengthens the core stabilizers and therefore gives stability to the spine.

The flexibility section is very well done and does a great job at targeting the muscles that were worked in the other sections of the dvd, they aren't just random stretches thrown in for the sake of it.

So for a person who has already achieved a solid level of fitness and is looking for a different, more functional type of workout to do at home, I'd highly recommend this program. But this is definitely NOT for beginners nor those with knee issues.

If you are a stone beginner, especially if you have been sedentary and/or carrying some extra weight, I'd recommend getting some basic instruction with a certified fitness professional to learn basic exercise technique and what is safe for your specific body (and how to make modifications). I'm not just making this suggeston because I'm a personal trainer, but I have known about too many people that try to do training with a program like this and get injured because they try to follow verbatim what the person on the video is doing even though it may be completely inappropriate for their current fitness level or health status. What you might save by preventing a possible injury (not to mention medical expenses) is well worth the price of sessions from a really sound trainer.",1256515200,60,5238,4.823857302118172
2988802,5,B000WOSAV0,"First, I'll note that, although I own several of Kathy Smith's dvds I am not biased towards her...I've given one or two of them just one star before when the cueing is bad.

That said, this one is a real winner!

How I measure caloric burn:
First, let me add that I wear a bodybugg to monitor my daily caloric expenditure. I say this only so you'll know what I note is based upon scientific measurement, rather than simply perceived exertion. It can also monitor calories burned per minute and just during a workout so I have great measurement in how a fitness dvd does, regardless of whether I feel I'm burning a lot or not. And I've amassed a large fitness dvd library over the years because I workout to them 6 days a week so I have a few to compare it to...

Caloric burn:
okay, so that said, I've learned that most dvds will fall into cardio dvds which tend to burn more calories as you do them and strength dvds which burn less during the workout but helps to continue burning more throughout the rest of the day and develps muscle which also raises metabolism. I have a much harder time finding a dvd that does both. One of the Crunch dvds does this and the Biggest Loser dvds are all pretty good at it as well. This one is one of those rare exercise dvds that builds and tones but scorches the calories and keeps your heart rate up the entire time.

Cueing:
Excellent. In some dvds Kathy can trip me up BADLY but this one is excellent and very easy to follow along to in spite of it being fast paced and full of energy.

Toning:
Full body workout, even standing ab work. Head to toe.

Cardio:
Keeps your heart rate in the target fat burning zone AND builds muscle

Equipment: You'll need hand weights. She suggests light and heavy to medium but I used 6-7 lb the whole time in each hand. My preferred weights.

Instruction: Good instruction and advice on workout out safely and for the best effect.

Energy: good but not with some of the ""wooop! ""yeahs!"" that Kathy has in some dvds that get a tad overdone and irritating at times...this one is upbeat but no silly screaming out by the backout team.

Conclusion: I can't really find anything I'd change about this one. I mean sometimes Kathy isn't super high energy as though she's really loving what she's doing but that's not a huge thing, just if I had to pick sometjhing in comparison to some other instructors...but the main thing is this one will do what it says...tone you and trim the fat and you'll be able to easily follow along.",1254873600,24,2497,4.37365010799136
2988803,5,B000WOSAV0,This video is a great workout.  I have been using Jillian Michael workouts and love them as I feel I am toning my body as well as getting cardiovascularly fit at the same time.  I would rate this video on the same level as she does upper body with lower body at the same time to get the heart rate up.  That video will do just as the title states.  I happen to buy this at Marshall for $3.99 and was nervous whether this would be good... it turned out to be great!!  More than my money's worth.  Awesome addition to my workout collection that I will definitely be using on regular basis!,1254441600,3,587,4.150442477876106
2988804,5,B000WOSAV0,"Well Kathy does it again.  She always manages to make interesting workouts.  The first 30 minutes are with hand-held weights and many variations on sqats and lunges with interesting upper-body moves.  It is a great workout. The Core Conditioning is ""Crunch-free""....which pleases me.  Nice stretching,,,,good to see that she has not ignored this important aspect of a workout.  Good Bonus Challenge workout of 12 minutes too. Even after all these years and so many workouts under her belt, she still has to work on her ""natural rhythm"" to moving to the music. She just does not hear the downbeat. She has been lucky enough to surround herself with good choreographers and participants that she can occasionally glance at to get back on the beat. Her energy and enthusiasm
are contagious and the choreography is always good, no matter what DVD she produces.  I have many and love them all.  You will never go wrong with one of her productions.  Always good,effectful workouts and great choreography.",1244332800,5,998,5.006060606060606
2988805,4,B000WOSAV0,"I enjoy this workout as a substitute for going to an exercise class. It's current- using weights to add challenge to a series of core-strengthening upright moves (lunges squats etc). There is little here that could cause injury (always a good thing)- it's not ""boppy"" as some step and other aerobic workouts can be. I give it only 4 stars because I find the ""core"" section (we used to call it ab work) is not as challenging as I would like- but your core WILL be challenged by the first section of leg work with hand weights. I suggest downloading Tracy Anderson's $10 ab series from her website instead- it's more challenging and won't add bulk.

In general this is a good workout it won't bore you to death or irritate the heck out of you- and if you can't get to a gym, it's nice to be able to work a sweat up without using too much floor space.",1241481600,,848,4.3
2988806,5,B000WOSAV0,"Kathy Smith has always been one of my favorites.  I've used her videos and DVD's for years with good results.  She doesn't talk too much and when she does her voice is pleasant and easy to listen to.  She gears her programs for all levels and is very easy to follow.  And the workouts work!!  If you keep doing them, that is!!!",1237420800,,327,4.209677419354839
2988807,3,B000WOSAV0,"I just bought the DVD.  I have never done any of Kathy's other videos.  I had a baby 15 months ago and have 30lbs to loose.  I started working out a few months ago and stopped, so I didn't think I would be able to do the first 30 minute portion, but I finsihed it without stopping.  I did not use any weights, because it was my first time. I was able to add the 10 minute cool down, which was really helpful.  I think it's a pretty easy workout for beginners because she stops enough for you to catch your breath and doesn't do that many repetitions of each move.",1226793600,8,563,4.036036036036036
2988808,5,B000WOSAV0,"I found this workout to be fun and very doable.  I enjoy Kathy's energy and can tolerate all her enthusisam throughout the workout.  What I liked about this is it kept my heart rate up through the entire strength section.  The ab section is pretty much straight forward ab moves and I really enjoy the challenge on this one for advanced moves, for the days I want to push myself just a bit more.  The stretching was on cue and as always Kathy inspired.  Full of energy and fun to do.",1219881600,,483,4.263736263736264
2988809,4,B000WOSAV0,I didn't think this workout would be as tough as it was.  It really got my heart rate up and was a good workout.  I would recommend this.,1215648000,,137,3.857142857142857
2988810,5,B000WOSAV0,"Like the other reviewers said, this is a re-release.  I like this workout because its less than an hour and still feels like a GREAT workout.  There is a workout, core and stretch section, so you can mix and match if you are short on time.  The workout combines cardio and strength training, so its efficent and effective. There are options for beginners and if I need to make it more difficult, I just add more weights.  The core section is pretty good as well, and there are lots of options, so you can work your abs at your level.  I sweat a lot and often times I am sore the next day.  The first time I did this DVD my legs hurt for a couple days, and I have pretty strong legs from years of dance.

Concerns:  If you have bad knees, this may be a little bit hard on them, but I manage to get through it every time.  This DVD is not made for a true beginner unless you like having something to work towards.  I need to feel pushed to enjoy a DVD for longer than a week.",1201219200,28,973,4.020833333333333

3223292,5,B000WOSAV0,"Great workout!!! However if you have bad knees, this isn't the dvd for you because she does lots of forward lunges.  I really enjoyed the standing abdominal excercises with the weights.",1275091200,2,185,4.967741935483871
3223293,4,B000WOSAV0,"You should be fairly fit to do her workout & be familiar with basic weight training moves to not hurt yourself. For 30 she gets your heart pumping. Don't need a lot of floor space and it's very easy to follow, basic moves that are repeated. Her cuing is not so good but it's easy enough  to follow once you've done it a couple times. You can make it a more intense workout by using heavier weights and going into the lunges more or you can stay light which is nice. You will use your whole body. I have not done the ab section  or the cool down stretch parts because I do that on my own. It's a fun workout that I will probably do for a long time.",1272412800,,647,3.9692307692307693

3223297,5,B000WOSAV0,"I'm a fan of Kathy Smith workouts, everything from the Lifting Weights video to the Total Body Lift to the belly dance foray.

This I consider to be her best: it flows along well, the moves seem interesting and are pleasant to do, the workout can be made more or less challenging depending on the weights you choose; and I like the separate core workout which can follow the standing one if you're up for it.  A bonus workout is even more challenging.  The stretching session is also very good.

This is a grower:  it's fun, it doesn't get stale, and it really works the bod.  I use it a lot.
Terrific!",1268352000,3,602,4.330357142857143
3223298,5,B000WOSAV0,"I purchased this workout a couple days ago and just did this workout this morning. I was very impressed overall!

I'm a certified personal trainer who is also an avid collector of fitness dvds (a couple hundred at least). As a trainer I think it's important to stay fresh and continue to see what others are doing and dvds are one of many excellent ways to get exposure to a wide variety of approaches and concepts.

One thing I really respect about Kathy Smith is that she not only puts out consistently strong products, but she isn't afraid to get input from others (such as Angela Freeman in this dvd, Rod Stryker in her Yoga Series, Keith Cook for Kickboxing etc.). Not only that, but she often has those same folks in her actual projects and gives credit where credit is due! (this is not as common as one might think).

This program is definitely for an intermediate and beyond exerciser. This is because there are complex movements involved that require a lot of neuromuscular coordination and if someone isn't already experienced with training they definitely might be risking injury.

 It's very important to have an awareness of what is safe for your specific body. There are some movements that might be contraindicated for you and you will need to know how to modify. Even though I'm a fitness professional and very fit,  I was in a car wreck many years ago that led me to have cervical spine surgery. As a result of both the injury and surgery, there are certain types of overhead movements that are unsafe for me to perform. I'm fortunate in that I have the knowledge to know how to modify or completely substitute movements. Someone without that experience might get themselves into trouble. While this should apply to any workout program, this particular program would certainly bear that out. This isn't a criticism of the dvd, which I think is great, but it's still an important consideration.

For example, this program contains multi-directional lunges (which are also combined with upper body movements). Front lunges in particular put a novice exerciser at the risk for placing too much shear force against their knees. With my own clients I always start with more stationary types of lunges (in fact I start with Yoga poses such as the various Warrior poses) and then move into reverse lunges in order to learn proper alignment and get a better inner feeling of the movements (kinesthetic awareness) before moving into forward lunge type movements.

For those who have done programs like P90X this program would be in the same general category as something like Core Synergistics. The exercises are different but the concept is very similar which is: multiplaner, multijoint, combination movements. What this means is that you might combine a rotating lunge with a row or press, so you are moving in a variety of directions with various combinations of lower and upper body movements at the same time.

This program definitely includes a lot of lower body work overall, squats and plies are present in addition to the lunges already mentioned.

There are also periods of ""speed"" work where you build into quick shuffle movements which are great for getting your heart rate up and also for working the muscles in a side to side pattern (in what is technically called the `Frontal Plane').

This dvd is broken up into sections and has the main workout, a core section and a flexibility section as well.

I particularly like the fact that the core section doesn't contain crunches. This falls in line with the cutting edge type of research done by people like Stuart McGill (a low back expert) who believe that repeated spinal flexion causes too much trauma to the intervertebral discs. Several exercises shown on this dvd are planks, side planks and bird-dog exercises which are considered by most knowledgeable trainers to be safe core exercises which not only do not aggravate the spine but in fact strengthens the core stabilizers and therefore gives stability to the spine.

The flexibility section is very well done and does a great job at targeting the muscles that were worked in the other sections of the dvd, they aren't just random stretches thrown in for the sake of it.

So for a person who has already achieved a solid level of fitness and is looking for a different, more functional type of workout to do at home, I'd highly recommend this program. But this is definitely NOT for beginners nor those with knee issues.

If you are a stone beginner, especially if you have been sedentary and/or carrying some extra weight, I'd recommend getting some basic instruction with a certified fitness professional to learn basic exercise technique and what is safe for your specific body (and how to make modifications). I'm not just making this suggeston because I'm a personal trainer, but I have known about too many people that try to do training with a program like this and get injured because they try to follow verbatim what the person on the video is doing even though it may be completely inappropriate for their current fitness level or health status. What you might save by preventing a possible injury (not to mention medical expenses) is well worth the price of sessions from a really sound trainer.",1256515200,60,5238,4.823857302118172
3223299,5,B000WOSAV0,"First, I'll note that, although I own several of Kathy Smith's dvds I am not biased towards her...I've given one or two of them just one star before when the cueing is bad.

That said, this one is a real winner!

How I measure caloric burn:
First, let me add that I wear a bodybugg to monitor my daily caloric expenditure. I say this only so you'll know what I note is based upon scientific measurement, rather than simply perceived exertion. It can also monitor calories burned per minute and just during a workout so I have great measurement in how a fitness dvd does, regardless of whether I feel I'm burning a lot or not. And I've amassed a large fitness dvd library over the years because I workout to them 6 days a week so I have a few to compare it to...

Caloric burn:
okay, so that said, I've learned that most dvds will fall into cardio dvds which tend to burn more calories as you do them and strength dvds which burn less during the workout but helps to continue burning more throughout the rest of the day and develps muscle which also raises metabolism. I have a much harder time finding a dvd that does both. One of the Crunch dvds does this and the Biggest Loser dvds are all pretty good at it as well. This one is one of those rare exercise dvds that builds and tones but scorches the calories and keeps your heart rate up the entire time.

Cueing:
Excellent. In some dvds Kathy can trip me up BADLY but this one is excellent and very easy to follow along to in spite of it being fast paced and full of energy.

Toning:
Full body workout, even standing ab work. Head to toe.

Cardio:
Keeps your heart rate in the target fat burning zone AND builds muscle

Equipment: You'll need hand weights. She suggests light and heavy to medium but I used 6-7 lb the whole time in each hand. My preferred weights.

Instruction: Good instruction and advice on workout out safely and for the best effect.

Energy: good but not with some of the ""wooop! ""yeahs!"" that Kathy has in some dvds that get a tad overdone and irritating at times...this one is upbeat but no silly screaming out by the backout team.

Conclusion: I can't really find anything I'd change about this one. I mean sometimes Kathy isn't super high energy as though she's really loving what she's doing but that's not a huge thing, just if I had to pick sometjhing in comparison to some other instructors...but the main thing is this one will do what it says...tone you and trim the fat and you'll be able to easily follow along.",1254873600,24,2497,4.37365010799136
3223300,5,B000WOSAV0,This video is a great workout.  I have been using Jillian Michael workouts and love them as I feel I am toning my body as well as getting cardiovascularly fit at the same time.  I would rate this video on the same level as she does upper body with lower body at the same time to get the heart rate up.  That video will do just as the title states.  I happen to buy this at Marshall for $3.99 and was nervous whether this would be good... it turned out to be great!!  More than my money's worth.  Awesome addition to my workout collection that I will definitely be using on regular basis!,1254441600,3,587,4.150442477876106
3223301,5,B000WOSAV0,"Well Kathy does it again.  She always manages to make interesting workouts.  The first 30 minutes are with hand-held weights and many variations on sqats and lunges with interesting upper-body moves.  It is a great workout. The Core Conditioning is ""Crunch-free""....which pleases me.  Nice stretching,,,,good to see that she has not ignored this important aspect of a workout.  Good Bonus Challenge workout of 12 minutes too. Even after all these years and so many workouts under her belt, she still has to work on her ""natural rhythm"" to moving to the music. She just does not hear the downbeat. She has been lucky enough to surround herself with good choreographers and participants that she can occasionally glance at to get back on the beat. Her energy and enthusiasm
are contagious and the choreography is always good, no matter what DVD she produces.  I have many and love them all.  You will never go wrong with one of her productions.  Always good,effectful workouts and great choreography.",1244332800,5,998,5.006060606060606
3223302,4,B000WOSAV0,"I enjoy this workout as a substitute for going to an exercise class. It's current- using weights to add challenge to a series of core-strengthening upright moves (lunges squats etc). There is little here that could cause injury (always a good thing)- it's not ""boppy"" as some step and other aerobic workouts can be. I give it only 4 stars because I find the ""core"" section (we used to call it ab work) is not as challenging as I would like- but your core WILL be challenged by the first section of leg work with hand weights. I suggest downloading Tracy Anderson's $10 ab series from her website instead- it's more challenging and won't add bulk.

In general this is a good workout it won't bore you to death or irritate the heck out of you- and if you can't get to a gym, it's nice to be able to work a sweat up without using too much floor space.",1241481600,,848,4.3

I started working out a few months ago and stopped, so I didn't think I would be able to do the first 30 minute portion, but I finsihed it without stopping.  I did not use any weights, because it was my first time. I was able to add the 10 minute cool down, which was really helpful.  I think it's a pretty easy workout for beginners because she stops enough for you to catch your breath and doesn't do that many repetitions of each move.",1226793600,8,563,4.036036036036036

What I liked about this is it kept my heart rate up through the entire strength section.  The ab section is pretty much straight forward ab moves and I really enjoy the challenge on this one for advanced moves, for the days I want to push myself just a bit more.  The stretching was on cue and as always Kathy inspired.  Full of energy and fun to do.",1219881600,,483,4.263736263736264

3223307,5,B000WOSAV0,"Like the other reviewers said, this is a re-release.  I like this workout because its less than an hour and still feels like a GREAT workout.  There is a workout, core and stretch section, so you can mix and match if you are short on time.  The workout combines cardio and strength training, so its efficent and effective. There are options for beginners and if I need to make it more difficult, I just add more weights.  The core section is pretty good as well, and there are lots of options, so you can work your abs at your level.  I sweat a lot and often times I am sore the next day.  The first time I did this DVD my legs hurt for a couple days, and I have pretty strong legs from years of dance.

Concerns:  If you have bad knees, this may be a little bit hard on them, but I manage to get through it every time.  This DVD is not made for a true beginner unless you like having something to work towards.  I need to feel pushed to enjoy a DVD for longer than a week.",1201219200,28,973,4.020833333333333

8224660,3,B000WOSAV0,"Kathy Smith's Build Muscle Shrink Fat seems to be designed for 20 - 30 year olds who are fairly fit and who want to maintain their physique. It isn't that this workout isn't fun it is just a bit intense for those over 40. As I near 50 I'm looking for workouts that I can follow along with without skipping a lot of exercises. So to be honest I skipped quite a few of the exercises on this DVD and modified a few to my level of fitness.

This is really one of those workouts where you can get a bit dizzy. I mean everything is happening so fast on screen it is sometimes hard to keep up with the pace. One thing I noticed was that the close ups are sometimes too close and you can't actually see what is being done. There is also some jumping up and down on your toes that I felt was just done too fast.

If you like lunges and squats this DVD has a lot. I would not recommend this for anyone who has knee issues. I'd call the whole workout ""knee intensive."" I modified most of the moves.

If you like Kathy Smith as I do you will enjoy her peppy workout style. Although a few times on this DVD she turns into a workout party animal which is funny. I'm glad she can express her joy in such a fun way.

28 minutes into this workout however my arms were worn out from carrying the weights. So you might want to not carry the weights the whole time. Also I would have liked her to have given me a water break. You will drink a whole bottle of water while doing this workout. I was thirsty the whole time.

The abs workout is also very intense and seems intermediate to advanced.

I felt this workout mainly in my knees and lower back. I think this workout requires a level of core conditioning that is intermediate.
