582582,4,6303131891,"This collection consists of Abbott & Costello Meet ...Frankenstein, The Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Invisible Man.
The Frankenstein and Invisible Man movies are possibly the best with more cohesive plots and more Abbott & Costello than the other two movies.  However, all these movies are winners in my book.  All the movies have classic Abbott & Costello repartee and it's great to have all four of these classic monsters with Abbott & Costello in a set!",1036281600,68,466,4.8125
582583,5,6303131891,"My two children were able to watch all three of these movies for the fist  time the other day.  It was wonderful to see their eyes light up at all the  funny faces that Lou Costello made and the wise cracks of Bud Abbott.  But  what was truly rare for them was to watch pure simple comedy that isn't  around today.  These movies proved to be as wonderful today as they were  when they were made.  Both of my children (ages 9 and 6) couldn't wait for  the next one to start.  Thank you to Abbott and Costello for the pure,  simple comedy that will live on in our home for a long time.",968112000,4,583,4.017543859649122

583022,5,6303131891,"The first time I saw A & C Meet the Mummy, I was 9 mos pregnant (and overdue). It was about 3 AM and I couldn't sleep, so I turned on a late night movie.
 I don't know if it had anything to do with the resulting situation or not, but I laughed so hard and so long, I subsequently went into labor. Seven hours later, I gave birth to my daughter (she's now 46).  Ever since VHSs and DVDs came out, I have been trying to find this particular movie. I managed to copy a TV airing onto a VHS blank, but the true/original quality just wasn't there.. Now, I will have it!
If you only purchase one A & C , make it this one. You won't regret it.  Seeing Lou sliding across that marble polished floor on his butt alone is worth the cost.",1508803200,,727,3.931972789115646

583104,5,6303131891,"Your experience may vary, but we old timers can fondly remember the Abbott and Costello comedies that we saw on the (not so) big screen when we were in Jr High or High School.  You may be able to find one or more of these on You Tube, but the convenience of the DVD is far better.  For the younger generation, the special effects will seem pretty lame, but just sit back and appreciate.  And, special effects don't always enhance the story - case in point - compare the 1935 version of King Kong with the modern retellings; or compare ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" with a more recent war related movie.  Does the old and 'outdated' version stir something in you that the modern versions don't touch?  OK, I'll get off of the soap box; but just spend a measly ten bucks to enjoy.",1505174400,2,781,4.321917808219178

583274,5,6303131891,"4 of Abbott and Costello's better movies. Take the best comedy team at the time and pair w the best horror actors and costumes and you have a winner.

If you love the monsters you might do real well w this set only. If you love Abbott and Costello justvas much or more you have a decision to make. There currently is available a set with all Abbott and Costello movies from United Artists that includes these 4.

Bothvthis set and the other one are bargains. The interests you have whether just wanting the monster ones or all of them will frame your decisions.

I bought this set first then got the other and gave this one to my parents when  I purchased the complete set. The complete set doesn't have every movie they did as they did a few independent of UA whether independent or with another studio. This set features Abbott and Costello meeting the wolf man Dracula and Frankenstein monster in one movie the comedy team meeting Dr jeckyel  and Hyde and another they meet the invisible man ant the fourth they meet the mummy.

Due to the age one can rest assured it is good clean family fun in a movie.",1496880000,2,1107,4.375609756097561
583275,5,6303131891,"What a terrific set - so good to see that Universal finally packaged all four of the Abbott & Costello monster films together.  Like a lot of comedy from Hollywood in the 30s-50s, Abbott & Costello can seem dated by today's standards. It's a gentler, sillier type of slapstick humour combined with clever dialogue, but the social settings, quaint perceptions and colloquialisms of the period are often alien to modern audiences (eg Buck Privates, In the Navy, etc. just don't work so well now).

However by mashing comedy into the horror genre a whole new type of film emerged, and Abbott & Costello arguably did this before anyone else - their ""monster"" films are the direct ancestors of films like Night in the Museum. By shifting the focus away from the everyday 30s-50s situations to a more fantasy mileau the films take on a more timeless aspect, which works very well. It's also important that they don't make fun of the old Universal monsters - they are affectionate towards the films of the previous era, and that gets the audience on side.

Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein is the absolute stand out. a 10/10 film that is worth the price of the whole set. This is an iconic film that you must see.

Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy is one of their last films, and the actors were showing their age by then, but it still works and is a solid 7.5/10

The other two films are fun, but not of the same strength - say 6-7/10. Still worth watching, but you probably won't watch them more than once, whereas Frankenstein will become a favorite, I guarantee.

The one thing that would have improved this set is if the producers had expanded it to include ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer"", ""Hold that Ghost"" and ""Who Done It"". These 3 films all have a mystery/noir/thriller background to the story and would have combined well with the monster films.",1496707200,,1856,4.62613981762918

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were probably the greatest comedians in twentieth century America. They made many comedies that dealt with life, such as Buck Privates, In the Navy, In Hollywood, Keep Em Flying, In the Foreign Legion, etc. I never saw a bad movie. They also had a radio show and a television show. These four are satires on the horror movies of the 1930s. You should have seen the original horror movies to best appreciate these satires, but its not necessary. Their movies were all funny and very popular. Some of their movies dealt with the popular Westerns of that time (Ride Em Cowboy and The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap). The Time of Their Lives was set during the War for Independence.

Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein.
The boys work in shipping, they move crates from Europe to the House of Horror. These are the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula. Larry Talbot calls to warn them! There is comic action and confusion along with the threats from monsters.

Abbot and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.
Bud and Lou graduated from a Detective School and get their first client, a man wanted by the police. A boxing manager was killed because of a fixed fight and Tommy is the suspect. The horror in this movie is the crooked boxing matches and those who profit from them.

Abbot and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Bud and Lou are Bobbies in early 20th century London. Women demonstrate for the vote. Dr. Jekyll performs experiments for the good of mankind. There is a monster killer on the loose. After comedy and chases the threat is ended.

Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy.
An archeologist found a mummy in Egypt and ships it to America. But some try to prevent this! There is a song and dance. A missing map will reveal the location of a vast treasure. There are repeats of earlier comic skits. Will it end in a blast?",1479513600,,1885,4.598214285714286

584298,5,6303131891,"Universal, the legendary horror studio of the 1930s and '40s, also produced the Abbott and Costello comedies of the 1940s and '50s.
In 1948, they had the genius idea of combining both franchises in the wildly successful ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"".
More than Frankenstein - the movie also included Universal's other horror stars Dracula and The Wolf-Man.
Dracula was Bela Lugosi .... No problem there.
The Wolf-Man was Lon Chaney Jr..... No problem there..
Frankenstein should have been Boris Karloff .... but he wasn't.

Karloff played the Frankenstein Monster in the first three films (1931-1939).
Chaney took over in 1942, followed by Lugosi in 1943..
Glenn Strange finished off the series in 1944 and 1945.
Universal would have liked to cast Karloff in the Abbott and Costello film, but he was either tired of the role or held out for too much money.
Since Lugosi and Chaney were already in the cast, the role of Frankenstein went by default to Glenn Strange.

""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" was an enormous hit in 1948, which caused Karloff to have second thoughts.
in 1949, he agreed to co-star in ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"",
probably the most awkward movie title ever -- see movie poster below.
""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"" is not in this collection.
A justifiable decision  its not really a horror comedy, more of a mystery comedy (and its not as funny as Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein).
But it does have elements of the supernatural, and it does have Boris Karloff.
Karloff plays sinister mystic Swami Talpur, but in the end he turns out to be just a crook, not a real Svengali.
I do wish Universal had included it in this collection, since it is unavailable outside of big multi-disc collections.*

Boris Karloff returned once more for 1953s Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (in this collection).
The new two-DVD set is the easiest way to acquire ""Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr, Hyde""
I only wish Universal had coupled this film with ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"",
thereby giving us a convenient coupling of the two films that Boris Karloff made with Abbott and Costello.

Two additional entries (without famous co-stars) are in this box:
--- Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951)
I wish Vincent Price had been cast (he had a cameo as the Invisible Man in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein).
Instead they chose the unmemorable Arthur Franz.
--- Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy (1955) with Michael Ansara as the Mummy  another role originated by Boris Karloff.
