8196568,5,B000QJM90E,"The negative reviews of this DVD are from political activists who are upset that real evidence shows that their manufactured poster boy of gay hate crime is not who they claim he is.  A lot of people are making money off the name of Matthew Shepard and furthering the cause of presenting the image that gays are being mercilessly beaten by heterosexuals for no other reason than hatred of homosexuals.

The truth is that this murder was a robbery by two men on a meth binge. Aaron McKinney was acquitted of first degree murder but convicted of second degree murder and aggravated robbery and kidnapping.  This ABC News program is great journalism, presenting a lot of important information that is being hidden from the public.  There is even a gag order in the plea deal to keep these murderers from talking.  There is a conspiracy to keep people from knowing the truth.

In this program, you will learn that the primary murderer was Aaron McKinney, and that after he attacked Shepard, he also attacked two other people, fracturing the skull of one of them, but not killing either of them.  Were these other attacks happening the same night also motivated by gay hatred?  No.  Nobody is claiming that.  In fact, most people do not even know that others besides Matthew Shepard also were attacked.

If you want an idea of the content of this program, google the following phrase:  New Details Emerge in Matthew Shepard Murder - ABC News

The first link should bring you to a Nov. 26, 2004 article.  After reading this article, I suspect you might be inclined to buy this DVD.

Another book you might be interested in was written by a gay man who was one of the producers of this ABC 20/20 story.

This book contains a lot more facts and information.  I highly recommend it.",1381104000,5,2040,5.1676829268292686
8196569,5,B000QJM90E,"Anyone who thinks this is `old news' and has no current relevance, check out the Political Thought Crime law passed in the frenzy of Gaystapo Hate propaganda that followed it:

1367 SEC. 4701. SHORT TITLE. This division may be cited as the

""Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act"".

(3) CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATION.-Nothing in this division, or an amendment made by this division, shall be construed or applied in a manner that infringes any rights under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Nor shall anything in this division, or an amendment made by this division, be construed or applied in a manner that substantially burdens a person's exercise of religion (regardless of whether compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), speech, expression, or association,unless the Government demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest

and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest, if such exercise of religion, speech, expression, or association was not intended to - (A) plan or prepare for an act of physical violence; or

(B) incite an imminent act of physical violence against another. ..................................................................................................
In Short - a subjective determination by parties as yet un-named that there is a ""Compelling Interest"" to destroy the First Amendment Rights of one who is subjectively deemed (in the opinion of said parties as yet un-named) to be a danger to use Words Alone to ""INCITE"" Others...-

Is all that is needed to overcome the Constitution and its `protections', at least such as still remain in this Age of Abomination.

NO H8? -- BOMBSHELL BOOK: MATTHEW SHEPARD TORTURED, MURDERED BY GAY LOVER
[...]

Almost everything you think you know about the Matthew Shepard narrative is false.

a Mathew Shepard industry grew rapidly with plays and foundations along with state and even national hate crimes legislation named for him.

= new book by an award winning gay journalist we now know that much of this narrative turns out to be false, little more than gay hagiography.

The Advocate asks,:
""... does it color our understanding of such a crime if the perpetrator and victim not only knew each other but also had sex together, bought drugs from one another, and partied together?""

The Book of Matt... by investigative journalist Stephen Jiminez...

- Shepard was a meth dealer himself and he was friends and sex partners with the man who led in his killing.
-
- Indeed, his killer may have killed him because Shepard allegedly came into possession of a large amount of methamphetamine and refused to give it up.",1379289600,5,2774,5.234762979683973
8196570,2,B000QJM90E,This is 20/20 at its worst! And I love 20/20. It is full of leading questions and sloppy journalism IMHO - not the quality of show that Ive come to expect from this team.,1366070400,3,170,4.029411764705882
8196571,5,B000QJM90E,"Matthew Shepard was killed by his fellow meth-heads, one of whom is bisexual, for money to buy more meth. Nothing to do with him having HIV or whom he slept with. Congrats to 20/20 and the NYTimes who praised ABC News for running ""an intellectually brave episode.""",1337731200,5,264,4.638297872340425
8196572,1,B000QJM90E,"This outrageous piece of garbage is only worth your time if you want to see an example of the worst kind of gutter journalism.  It's full of insinuations about Matthew Shepard and it includes interviews with his murderers (I am told that a condition of them getting life sentences instead of the death penalty was that they never give interviews, but why should ABC care when there's a buck to be made, and the murderers figured somewhere down the road, they might get some leniency). Vargas even feeds lines to Aaron McKinney (""So you were just out of your mind on drugs when you did this, right?""  ""Yeah!"").  There are inconsistencies even in the interviews ABC included in the show, but they didn't bother to point them out.  It's same point of view used by those who try to get leniency for abusers in domestic violence matters by reframing events and asking ""What did the victim do to make the abuser so mad?""

Matthew Shepard wasn't ""Matthew from Nazareth""-and no one(even his parents) tried to fit him for sainthood.  But to throw mud at his reputation by asking people who only stood to gain from him not being able to respond is utterly reprehensible.  I only gave it one star because the system wouldn't allow me to leave no stars, or what would have been more appropriate-  negative stars.",1273622400,9,1300,4.646288209606987
8196573,1,B000QJM90E,"This DVD should be clearly labeled as the poisonous collection of falsehoods and distortions that it has been conclusively proven to be. The claims about drugs are specious and the whole effort to create a negative image of Shepard is  really vicious and disgraceful,adding further insult to his mortal injuries.  The producers of this supposed news magazine should be barred from ever presenting their work as journalism--it is fraud and lies.",1255305600,10,444,5.23943661971831
8196574,5,B000QJM90E,Okay I Didnt See The Show But The Only Reason Is Cause Judy Matthews Mother Had Said AFTER She Saw The Show They Took All The Things She HAd Said Out Of Conteches So It Looked Like She Had Been Agreeing With Everything The Interviewer And Aaron & Russell Were Saying WHICH WAS NOT TRUE!!!,1203120000,3,288,4.254545454545455
8196575,1,B000QJM90E,"If you want to see Matthew Shepard's murderers make things up as they go along to a completely shameless Elizabeth Vargas, then watch this episode of 20/20.  If, on the other hand, you have a brain and don't appreciate the drudging up of an awful crime for ratings--with no really new information--then ignore this tripe.",1202428800,17,321,4.836363636363636
