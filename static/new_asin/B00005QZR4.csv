8198814,5,B00005QZR4,"I bought this film because I was impressed with the actor, Tobias Moretti, in the Austrian cop series, Inspector Rex, and I was looking for more  movies in German to improve my language skills. I was not disappointed. The DVD arrived in a very timely fashion, too.
Since I first posted this review, the supporting actor, Christoph Waltz, has won an Oscar Award for his role in Inglorious Basterds.
Because someone asked in a post below - no, there are no subtitles. That's a shame. This movie deserves a bigger audience.",1398211200,,520,4.714285714285714
