8022126,5,B00024JAL4,"Admittedly, the bar is pretty low when it comes to picture quality on the old ""Cisco Kid"" TV show material. But I was pleasantly surprised with the quality on these sets and am happy to recommend them.",1392940800,,201,4.45945945945946

Go glad I purchased this video for my Western video collection. Always looking for more.",1287619200,,118,4.619047619047619
8022128,5,B00024JAL4,"This was an unbeatable deal from Amazon.com. The quality of the product is superb, it arrived in an above average shipping time, and the price was at least $10.00 cheaper than the retail movie store.",1264550400,,199,4.714285714285714
8022129,5,B00024JAL4,Cisco Kid Collection 3 like Collections 1 and 2 are very good I don't know about Collection 4 as I have not seen it yet. I would defintly reocomend it.,1226793600,3,151,4.066666666666666
8022130,5,B00024JAL4,"The picture quality is not perfect, but it's a real treat to see each episode again. Hopefully some company will see the interest in this and other classic TV shows, & digitally remaster them. But again, the picture is not bad at all, and watching these episodes of the Cisco Kid sure beats looking at what Hollywood flings at us today! Each set is worth adding to your collection of good TV westerns.",1210032000,,401,4.506849315068493
8022131,4,B00024JAL4,"The third in the series of The Cisco Kid Collections is another winner. These are the best prints of this series I've ever seen. While they are not crystal clear, they are certainly better than the worn syndicated prints which turn up on local TV stations. Very enjoyable and highly recommended to all vintage TV westerns fans.

Volume 4 is rumored to be slated for February, 2005 release. I certainly hope so.",1101340800,4,410,4.694444444444445
