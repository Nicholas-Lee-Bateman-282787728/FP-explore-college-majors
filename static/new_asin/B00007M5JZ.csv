1822921,2,B00007M5JZ,"Before I begin, let me mention that I was trained as a classical ballet dancer until I was 15 (at which time I was forced to stop due to injury), and feel that I can describe myself as a relative authority on ballet technique.

As mentioned by others, the sets and costumes in this production are beautiful. The first act especially is lavishly dressed in a Gothic style, which is an interesting variation on other productions. The dark, rich colors in the first and third acts contrast nicely with the pastel blues that are inevitably used in the second and fourth acts. It is obvious that this production is meant to endure with this company.

The dancing, however, is unfortunate. While as a whole the men are technically superior, their acting is below par. As far as the women go, the arms and hands of this company are not as fluid and expansive as they ought to be when portraying the swans. Likewise, their feet lack the articulation necessary for such a classical work. The short, muscular build that this company seems to favor does not compare to the ethereal, sinuous swans of the Russian companies, and their dancing is similarily earthbound.

The principals are also disappointing. Anders Nordstrom dances a Siegfried that is forgettable and poorly acted, though, as I said before, his technique is excellent. Nathalie Nordquist is obviously young, and has not yet mastered the subtle acting necessary to make the ballet soar. The black swan looks awkward on her, as if she tries too hard to seem evil, where her dancing should make it clear. Her technique is imperfect, and while her extensions are certainly sufficient, they are often not precisely placed. The famous fouettes in the third act travel a disappoingly large distance, when they are not supposed to move at all. Her arms, like those of the corps, are not reminiscent of a swan's wings at all.

Overall, despite the number of people onstage, this production is missing the feeling of epic ballet that is so present in other productions. The second act seems small and inelegant, and the third lacks the gradeur of a palace.

I would not recommend this version of Swan Lake, as there are so many others that are decidedly superior to this one.",1114905600,,2220,4.770833333333333
1822922,2,B00007M5JZ,"I am moving to Sweden soon and therefore I thought I'd check out their classical ballet since I am a ballet lover.  There are two pluses and that's why I gave two stars, but unfortunately, these two stars have nothing to do with the dancing itself.  The first star is given for supplying a plausible reason why there is only the queen and a prince who's been pressured to marry soon (The king's funeral starts this Swan Lake) and that the set and custumes are gorgeous.  The second star is given for good camera work, that allows for a good viewing of the dancing.  Precisely because of these two pluses the disappointment at the end is great.  The prince and the swan princess are wooden, no chemistry at all.  The whole performance is permeated with a somberness, even when the prince chances upon the Swan and supposedly falls madly in love with her.  I couldn't feel the passion.  On top of the lacking of emotion, the technique by both the leading dancers are not up to par.  The DVD was recorded in 2002, and the modern, up-to-date camera work means I really got to see the footwork--and in this case, the lack of.  Swan Lake is a hard ballet to sit through if the combination of charisma AND technique is not present.  Let's face it, Swan Lake is long and the story line ridiculous.  If the audience is not mesmerized by the dancing and the emotion, what will make them stay?  I won't be going to the Swedish Opera House unless others are performing.

Last thought:  I know the Artistic Director rambled on about ""going back to the roots"" and ""authenticity.""  Let's face it:  Swan Lake has evolved over time.  That evolution is the reason why it remains one of the most-performed and wide-spread ballet.  If authenticity means over-the-top drama and rigid execution of choreography, Swan Lake, or any other great ballets, would have been swept into obscurity long ago.",1105228800,,1875,4.627272727272727
1822923,5,B00007M5JZ,"Of all the Swan Lakes that I have seen, both live and through video, this is by far the most well-though-out.  To break with the 'traditional' interpretation, most ballet companies nowadays completely change something in the story (e.g., costumes, setting, the plot itself); this, however, does not make their production unique.  Unlike these companies, the Royal Swedish Ballet in this rendition stuck to the ancient Gothick tale.  However, instead of creating outrageous costumes, or something just as tasteless, the choreographer reshaped the ballet to make more sense of the loopholes in the story, removing pieces of music that were not essential to the telling of the tale.  On top of that, the dancers of this ballet were exceptional.  One cannot keep their eyes off these dancers.",1103587200,,788,5.222222222222222
1822924,5,B00007M5JZ,"I put the DVD in my player with apprehension. Other productions of Swan Lake had put me to sleep, yet I persisted in my search for a production that I might enjoy because this story became such a popular ballet. I found this production thoroughly enjoyable from the first minutes. Several times, I gave a standing ovation to the artists.

The company synchronized incredibly well. I enjoyed seeing the men dance so beautifully, not just stuck in supportive roles. The costumes and sets were dramatic and beautiful. All worked well together to produce a completely stunning experience.

I watched this production in 3 sittings to fully savor it, certainly not because of boredom. When I reached the end, I watched the special features, hungry for more from these artists. I found the interviews with Sir Peter Wright and the principal dancers to be enlightening, interesting and surprising.

I am looking for more ballet productions by this company.",1102809600,,948,5.025477707006369
1822925,5,B00007M5JZ,"I was looking for a performance of ""Swan Lake"" that would give me both musical and visual satisfaction and at the same time would be suitable for watching with children. I've seen many productions of this ballet but each had some problems. The magnificently conducted performance from Berlin (on Arthaus) was well danced but didn't convince me in its overly psychologizing dramatic approach. The cruelly abbreviated performance from Moscow with the fantastic Maya Plisetskaya was a great document but musically almost unbearable. Another Bolshoi performance, with Bessmertnova and Bogatyrev, gorgeously staged, danced (apart from Bessmertnova who seemed too mechanical to me) and played, was somewhat messy in its treatment of the libretto. There were some other performances, including Nureyev's and Fonteyn's, that somehow didn't work for me.
For many reasons, the Swedish Ballet's ""Swan Lake"" seems to me close to perfection, even if it isn't perfectly danced and - as some reviewers mentioned already- is certainly not the most rewarding musically. The orchestral playing is crude and often heavy (very prominent brass), particularly when compared with the luxurious playing of the Berlin Staatskapelle under Daniel Barenboim on Arthaus. Yet the conductor (Michel Quval, otherwise unknown to me) seems to understand the dancers and leads them sensitively, if not always beautifully.

The corps de ballet respond to the music in a way that I don't think I've ever seen before: they really dance to the music, they seem to listen to it and respond with their steps. I am no great expert on ballet but what strikes me often, even in some very good ballet performances is the discrepancy between the music and the dance, the rhythm and the steps. The dancers seem to be so focused on giving the audience the thrill of a physically spotless performance, that they forget about everything else, including the music. It is a bit like in opera, where it is often more important to deliver the vocal goods at the cost of clarity and the musical coherence of the piece.
Here, thanks to often rather slow tempi, the dancers really have time to ""illustrate"" the music through their dance and even if it isn't the most muscular or dynamic dancing you are likely to see, the effect is riveting. On the other hand, what to me is a virtue of this performance, can be easily a vice for those who like their ""Swan Lake"" danced with breathless virtuosity and technical assurance. I certainly wouldn't call this dancing ""amateurish"" but there are long scenes in this production where there seems to be no dancing at all, just a  pantomime-style narration of the story. To me, this is what really distinguishes this performance - its  narrative clarity, achieved through the choreography and great camera work. No gesture is wasted - everything illuminates the story. This is very important if you want to watch the performance with kids and expect them to understand the story without much help, although for obvious reasons I would be happier with this version if it chose the ""happy ending"" solution (Siegfried defeats Rothbart and lives with Odette happily ever after) instead of the original ""happy suicide"" (Odette throws herself into the lake and Siegfried follows her after having defeated von Rothbart. They are reunited after death and we see them embracing each other as they slowly glide through the air).

The story, as told in Sir Peter Wright's choreography, focuses on Prince Siegfried who - as one reviewer mentioned - matures before our eyes. Wright wanted to show what motivated the prince in his search for a suitable bride - not the request of his domineering mother, as often portrayed, but the interest of his country. Wright begins the story with the funeral of the old king whose death leaves the throne to young Siegfried. I find this addition to the story very ingenious indeed, particularly since it makes a very good use of the rather melancholy music of the introduction.

As I said earlier, this performance may not be the best choice for those balletomanes who prefer more muscular, dynamic solo dancing - they may be particularly disappointed with the Prince (Anders Nordstrm). Although in the interviews Nordstrm is described as a more mature and experienced dancer than his very young partner Natalie Nordquist, I thought it was Nordquist who was the more impressive of the two. The Prince's performance in the solo numbers of act I and III was rather ""static"", hesitant. I almost had the impression that the choreographer was trying to spare him for some reason (sickness?) - how else can we explain his lack of participation in dancing in those scenes that usually give the dancers an opportunity to show off? It is Benno (Johannes hman) who does most of the dancing here (at times quite spectacular!), while the Prince is sitting in his throne and occassionally joins the dance for a few brief moments. He is a graceful dancer and a surprisingly charismatic stage persona, beautifully portraying the Prince's ""Weltschmerz"". This Prince is of course not your usual Siegfried, joyfully celebrating his 21st birthday, but Siegfried in mourning after his father's death. That may explain his reluctance to join the festivities in Act I but in Act III, where Siegfried should be a bit more outgoing, if only to give the dancer the last opportunity to ""show off"", he remains withdrawn. In the athletic scene with Odile his dancing has none of the breathtaking virtuosity expected here.
Natalie Nordquist is a delightful dancer and her Odette/Odile leaves the most favorable impression - it is a lovely, youthful portrayal of the  heroine(s), very musical and technically assured, at least to my eyes.

The performance is splendid visually, although I wouldn't mind a bit more colour, particularly in the court scenes (acts I and III). The first act is greyish (but beautifully so!) to depict the court's mourning, but the act III certainly could use more colour to break the monotonously golden brown scenography. The costumes are gorgeous and together with the sets beautifully convey the gothic setting of the story.

In spite of some reservations, I am very impressed with the overall quality of this ""Swan Lake"". It is coherent, atmospheric and pretty to watch. Its narrative clarity is outstanding. The dancing may not be in the class of Bolshoi or Kirov but it is impressive. If you are looking for a ""Swan Lake"" for your kids, this may be the best introduction.

1822926,5,B00007M5JZ,"As some one who is an expert on ballet(I am a ballet dancer), let me assure you that this is one of the top five performances of Swan Lake available.  The dancing of the entire company is extremely accurate and lyrical.  The use of mime is the best I have seen in any Swan Lake.  This is characteristic of Scandinavian traditon(the company director is proud to point out the contribution of the great Danish ballet choreographer of the 19th century, Bournonville, to the Royal Swedish Ballet in one of the many interviews on this dvd). The choreography is very well thought out and rehearsed.  The performance is fresh and vibrant, while still being classical and traditional.  The dvd is also very nicely packaged with a large and informative booklet.  If you are looking for a traditional Swan Lake performance,  don't pass this one up!",1091750400,,838,4.777777777777778
1822927,5,B00007M5JZ,"I've seen several productions of ""Swan Lake"", and I have to say that this is far and away probably the best one around.  Peter Wright's updated staging takes the classic tale of love and magic and turns it into an exquisite Gothic tragedy.  The ballet opens with the funeral of Siegfried's father, a narrative touch overlooked in other stagings.  As the prince faces the twin impending dooms of kingship and marriage (as his mother tells him, ""You WILL marry""), his friend Benno tries to cheer him up with wine, women, and dancing.  When that doesn't work, they decide, in classic male fashion, to go shoot something with Siegfried's new crossbow.  The rest of the story proceeds along familiar lines: the meeting of Siegfried and the enchanted swan-princess Odette, Siegfried's entrapment by the sorcerer Von Rothbart and his disguised daughter Odile, and the final reunion of the lovers in death.
What sets this production apart is its magnificent staging and excellent performances by the artists of the Royal Swedish Ballet.  Anders Nordstrom is a boyish Siegfried who seems to mature as we watch, until he makes the final step into adulthood with his pledge to die with his beloved.  Johannes Ohman is a hoot as sidekick Benno; watch his chagrin in Act I when the Queen discovers the court carousing after the King's funeral.  He and Nordstrom are also very fine dancers, effectively displaying their prowess in the Act I pas de trois (now a dance with two courtesans) and the Polonaise, which becomes a bravura drinking dance for the men.  Nathalie Nordquist is a lovely Odette, delicate and lyrical.  Her Odile, however, is somewhat less effective, perhaps because of her young age; she lacks the attack and sensuality of a more seasoned ballerina, and in her hands Odile becomes more charming flirt than evil seductress.  Still, Nordquist shows great promise in such a difficult role.  (For the record, my favorite Odile is Susan Jaffe's portrayal in ""American Ballet Theatre: Variety and Virtuosity"".)  The costume and set designs are sumptuous, if a bit dark, and the whole thing is a visual feast.  The DVD also includes fascinating extras, such as interviews with Nordstrom and Nordquist, a look back at other classic ""Swan Lake"" productions, and a chat with choreographer Wright about the story behind his staging (which is helpful if your ballet-mime-to-English is a bit shaky).  If you can only buy one ""Swan Lake"" for your collection, make it this one!",1054771200,,2468,4.985365853658537
1822928,5,B00007M5JZ,"I just bought two DVDs of the Swan Lake. One is the Barenboim, Scherzer, Matz, Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin (I will soon write a review for that one) and the one on this page.  The both are very good.  The one on this page has stunning costumes and stage sets.  The sections with the white swans are magnificent and Nathalie Nordquist is absolutely stunning.  She dances with impeccable technique and superlative expression.  Her swan is a joyful one rather than a dejected, oppressed bird.  In addition, the camera work is extremely rewarding with a very clear picture and rich color.  The sound is very clear and the orchestra plays well. Since I am a professional musician, I have compared the music in this DVD with the Barenboim, Scherzer, Matz, Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin.  The Barenboim is a musical experience in itself.  The music is so well performed that one could play it as a music source without the video and find it very rewarding.  You can't say the same about the Swedish orchestra in this DVD, but if you are watching the video and not comparing the orchestra with a superlative performance, the production is very enjoyable.
This DVD is sure to remain one of my favorites and recommend it to anyone interested in a Swan Lake performance.  Nathalie Nordquist and the swans make it totally worth the purchase and the time spent watching the performance.",1049760000,,1369,4.8076923076923075
7978398,5,B00007M5JZ,"The other five-star reviewers have covered this well, and I won't repeat their information or opinions.  This is a well-conceived, intense, intelligent, and uniquely affecting production of Swan Lake.  There is an intimacy and depth of feeling here that you will not find in other productions. The principals and the corps are focused and crisp--you'll see no sloppy work or perfunctory dancing.  The handling of the final moments is freshly conceived and beautifully effective. Some may find the tempi tend to be slow in this production as compared to what one is accustomed to; but I believe this pensive, savoring pace more nearly approaches the composer's intentions, and suits this production well. If I had to find a fault, it would be that Rothbart being in black often disappears in the shadows and blackness of the gloomy sets; and yet, even this brings a kind of enrichment--it's as if he's a symbol of the dark and hardly understood threats lingering in the subconscious.  You will see more athletic Swan Lakes, quicker ones, ones that are positively cheerful, ones in which the principals are there to show themselves off rather than to support the validity of the show.  But this elegant, beautifully danced, empathetic, powerful production is the one you will never forget.",1482624000,,1287,5.05188679245283
7978399,5,B00007M5JZ,"Out of the 16 different versions of Swan Lake. this one ranks tops for the portrayal of Odette/Odile. Nathalie Nordquist, being so young, gave the best performance. It would appear that the video companies should consider producing DVDs of Swan Lake when the ballerina performs her very first Swan Lake, like when Alina Somova did it when she was 18 years old. By the time the ballerina matures to her top years, she no longer has the freshness to do Odette's character. As Svetlana Zakharova said in one of her interviews, ""It is easy to do the black swan character. I am still working on doing Odette.""
This is because being a prima ballerina is a very demanding job, requiring maximum self-control and discipline. Thus, it is very difficult to portray a soft and suffering character like Odette.
So, this DVDs is well worth your money, just for the performance of Nathalie Nordquist. BTW She did a black-swan variation that has never been done before, with a forward kick timed to the music. And she has never done it ever since. [I just saw Alina Cojocaru danced the exact same variation, so I stand corrected.]

As for the portrayal of Odile, you must remember that Odile must suppress her evilness in order to convince the Prince that she is Odette. Therefore, Odile must act young and sweet toward the Prince. Being seductive is not correct. This is why Nathalie Nordquist is a perfect Odile.

The attempt by Wright to go back to the original Swan Lake should not have stopped at 1895. He should have gone all the way back to the 1877 happy ending, which is danced by the Marinsky Ballet..",1418774400,,1596,4.656028368794326

7978401,5,B00007M5JZ,"The Royal Swedish Ballet's Swan Lake -- a performance at Stockholm's Royal Swedish Opera House on May 24, 2002 -- is the work's first 21st century commercial DVD release. For standard definition, the widescreen video image is good, the camera work effective, the sound rich and full. The Royal Swedish Opera Orchestra consists of polished musicians who count a Wagner Ring cycle in their repertoire, and the storied Royal Swedish Ballet stretches back to the 18th century, not so long after the Imperial Russian Ballet was founded across the Baltic in St. Petersburg.

It's not these facts alone, however, that cause this Swan Lake to be notable. The production's dramatic integrity lifts it above the ordinary and makes it worth seeing by those who love Tchaikovsky's ballet -- and who think they already know it.

Sometimes it's best to start with the Extras, which in this case are substantial. ""The Tale of Swan Lake"" is a reading of the synopsis printed in the booklet, valuable because not everyone is always observant of liner notes. The synopsis states, ""Following his father's death, Prince Siegfried will shortly be crowned king and must therefore marry. He dreads the loss of his freedom and has no wish to choose a bride he does not love. It is his 21st birthday."" Sir Peter Wright, who furnished new choreography for some of this production, explains in an interview that he started by going back to the beginning and asking himself how the characters arrived at their opening situations. In other words, ""Where's the king?"" It's not a question other productions of Swan Lake bother with.

Wright's solution is logical. During the overture, through fog and mist, we watch a funeral procession that includes a troubled young man and a distraught queen. The bier carries the coffin of Siegfried's father. From that point, Act I unfolds more coherently than usual, aided by Wright's sparkling choreography, by the excellent Royal Swedish corps de ballet, by gorgeous period costumes, by attractive stage sets that provide ample dancing space, and by the lively orchestra, conducted by Michel Qu&eacute;val.

As Wright points out, Swan Lake may be the Swan Queen's ballet, but it's Siegfried's story. Other Swan Lake stagings take the king's absence for granted and present a rather vague, bored prince who mostly sits around doing nothing in Act I while the audience waits impatiently for the Swan Queen to enter in Act II. No wonder 20th century Russian versions of Swan Lake inserted a jester to juice up the action.

Thanks to the profile Wright establishes for Siegfried, however, to Anders Nordstr&ouml;m's refreshing depiction of him, to his equerry Benno's moving things along, and the Gothic atmosphere Wright's production establishes and maintains, before we know it Siegfried has temporarily escaped his dilemma at court and is beside the Lake of the Swans.

Sensibly, Wright lets Lev Ivanov's classic Act II choreography stand practically untouched, leaving the question: How good is the Swan Queen, Nathalie Nordquist? She is splendid.

In an interview with the principals, young Nordquist tells how she worked hard to understand and reveal Odette's complex character. Only 23 at the time of this recording, she isn't an international superstar like Svetlana Zakharova, but she is a skilled dancer and actress who, without being eccentric, puts her own stamp on Odette in a satisfying manner. Nordstr&ouml;m continues his fine portrayal of Siegfried, and with the graceful swan maidens and Christian Rambe's nasty Rothbart, Act II is an unqualified success.

Wright improves Act III by using his own choreography to enliven the national dances before Rothbart and Odile take over. Nordquist says Odile is easier to portray than the more layered Odette, but I doubt much is easy in the dancing. Yet Nordquist never flags -- famous fouett&eacute;s and all. The stage sizzles with menace, and the act ends with a bang.

Throughout the production occur moments of exquisitely painful beauty, and two of them take place early in Act IV, first as the swan maidens gather and then as Siegfried caresses the heartbroken Odette. Providing a stronger finish than the ""happy-sappy"" ending, the Royal Swedish Ballet's Swan Lake generates an Aristotelian catharsis. The conclusion is utterly devastating. And utterly sublime -- the full-blown Gothic tragedy Tchaikovsky devised back in 1877.

In another rewarding Extras feature, Royal Swedish Ballet producer Petter Jacobsson emphasizes how this project's participants desired to return to the original Swan Lake -- or to the classic Petipa/Ivanov 1895 revival after Tchaikovsky's death -- as much as possible. In that effort, they have scored a resounding success.",1407456000,,4725,5.197109067017083
7978402,4,B00007M5JZ,"THIS IS A NON-PROFESSIONAL REVIEW.

SWAN LAKE- Swedish Royal Ballet w/ Natalie Nordquist & Anders Nordstrom

These notes were written as I watched the ballet. There is little chance you'll agree with my review of the first act & may think I'm ready to trash the whole performance.

The prologue was well done as to the death of the prince's father. You get a little preview of the quality of the facial expressions you'll see throughout the performance. The darkness of the lighting was appropriate for what was being shown.

Act 1 was a different experience for me. I quickly labeled this the Gray Ballet as there was subdued lighting combined with at least 8 different shades of gray in the costuming. Actually almost everything was grey, the floor, the backdrop, the overhead, most of the costumes & the constructs on stage. It was a costuming, set design & lighting mistake. If there had been a little more light then the detailing on the costuming, which was wonderful, but which you had to strain to see when not in close-up, would have shown up better & the costumes would have had the contrast wardrobe put into them. The principals were all dressed in gray as was most of the corps yet there was a splash of color on a few corps members, blue sashes, purple lining & some gold on the robes along with a very subdued green on a couple of the female dancers. This had the effect of making them, while standing off to the side, STAND OUT. It immediately pulls your eye off the dancing since gray dancers on a gray floor with a gray backdrop tend to disappear when a flash of color appears elsewhere. The color should have been on the principles, not much but some, either that or more light. The black & gold table cloth works fine in this scene, adding a rich & tapestry aspect to a dim view. The choreography, dancing & expressiveness are all top flight with a marvelous tempo to the piece. The orchestra performed wonderfully throughout the performance.

Act 2 corrects the lighting & color problems enough to be admired. The floor is blue now, of course it represents the lake but the increase in lighting above is what helps so much. You now see the costume detailing. The entrance of Rothbart is as correct as Act 1 was not, lighting & costuming wise. He is at the back in dark shadows, wearing black & fades onto the stage. His costume seems to eat light, the epitome of a slimy & black-hearted creature lurking to do evil. Yet there is a silvering on the border of his feathers that reflects small rays of light, defining his costume & movements.

Once again the choreography is beautiful as is the dancing & music. When the swans come on stage a change in lighting puts the very back of the stage in a blue cast & the front of the stage in a pale yellow. The tutu's of the swans change color as they move from front to the rear of the stage. Anytime they line up, whether straight or in a chevron you can see the last 2 or 3 have blue tutus & the rest yellow. I absolutely loved the pas de quatre.

Act 3 makes much better use of the backdrop & constructs. Once again the blue floor & tutus changing color only add to the visual treat this has become. Odette's face is very expressive as it will be through the entire performance. This is not a dance but a living love of the part she is playing & it shows on her face & in her steps. You really notice the lack of light & color from Act 1 by contrast here. Once past Act 1 the lighting & color issues are corrected & improved from act to act. The ballroom & dancing are so perfect I can't describe it. It was a staggering thing to watch with the first act still in mind.

The first folk dance, I thought the dancers looked like ballet dancers trying to perfect a folk dance. They had too much precision in their movements & not enough freedom as folk dancers would. The second folk dance was much better a freedom & flowing without a sense of trying to stylize what they were doing. The third folk dance returned to the same problem I had with the first one, but the fourth one got it dead perfect. I saw folk dancers not ballet dancers except for one easily spotted display of what I'm talking about as far as position dancing go.

At the end of the fourth dance two couples are in front & they both assume the same position over the arm of the man & the woman arched backward almost touching the floor. The one on the right throws her arm over her own shoulder & it lays limp on the floor, which is correct for a folk dancer. The one on the left assumes the same position except her arm that is backwards over her shoulder is in a slight upward V shape, her hand formed perfectly for a ballet dancer.

Odile is stunning; I'm thinking this Natalie is as good as anyone I've seen. I must state though, no one can match Plisetskaya's arm motion, and that was a gift I doubt will be repeated in my lifetime. Natalie's expressiveness, her tempo, her steps & the obvious joy she is having comes through even the TV screen.

Act 4 is a marvel. I have only this to say, it is a glorious tribute to what ballet is & can be. The finale is the best I've seen period. At the end my wife was crying & I was wiping tears because of the perfection displayed on the faces of all the dancers. What a troupe this is. Harsh & uncomplimentary I was on the combination of set, wardrobe & lighting in Act 1. I must praise the choreography, dancing, expressiveness (whole troupe) & sets elsewhere. The lighting after Act 1 was particularly spectacular. I would rate this as perfect had there been in Act 1, a little more light or the accent colors on the principles not the corps dancers or a lighter colored backdrop. Of all that I think more light & moving the colors from the corps to the principles would be best.",1316304000,,5762,4.330861909175162
7978403,5,B00007M5JZ,"Like others I have several different versions of this classic but what I liked most about this production was its consistency- all the parts come together and integrate as a total satisfying package. The colour palette fits,the lighting is suitably moody,the costumes work (beautifully) while being rightly non-committal about the period of the piece and the characters are convincing. As the Artistic Director says in his interview,the strength of the Company is in its theatricality and this dvd shows that so well. As for the dancers,this version is a warm, human drama not over-emphasising technique for the sake of it- thus maintaining the illusion in persuading us that the situation is believable. If icy technique is for you try Letestu and the POB. For me there are two defining moments with Nordquist- the physical reaction in act 2 when she accepts that Siegfried truly loves her, and the flash of her eyes in act 3 when she first meets him as the Black Swan- both significant moments which define the character. Yes she is young (so?) but what ability! And her partner Nordstrom not only looks the part but dances so well,as do all the supporting cast,particularly Rothbart who is one of the best ever. Interesting that Peter Wright has referenced Star Wars in the final resolution which also is one of the best to be seen. Coherence at last !
This is an excellent buy with unobtrusive camerawork and superb surround sound- it's the one I will be showing to the Grandchildren as a fine example of a deservedly famous ballet.",1244764800,,1536,4.866412213740458
7978404,5,B00007M5JZ,"I need not go into detail, as the other five star reviewers have said nearly all that need be said about this excellent production and performance by the Swedish Ballet.  I would add only that Swan Lake is a story ballet that requires acting as well as dancing.  Without abandoning gestures inherent in the original choreography, the Swedish dancers act their parts with both passion and restraint, whereas the Royal Ballet rather vapidly employ generic gestures copied from the Russians (who generally do such miming with greater flow and grace than the English). When I have a craving for the dark beauty of Swan Lake, I nearly always choose the Swedish version over any others.

In fact, I have gradually given away or sold off all my other Swan Lake DVDs except that of the even darker, uniquely daring but profoundly effective production by Matthew Bourne starring Adam Cooper with all of the swans expertly danced by men.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Swan-Lake-Matthew-Bourne/dp/B00004CWO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake (Matthew Bourne)</a>

In any case, the Swedes deserve five stars and more for their stunningly beautiful and refreshing (well, at times scary) 19th Century Gothic presentation of the original story and choreography.",1210204800,,1320,5.719387755102041

Now as to the negatives: First, Act 3 is the unbearably long, ""unabridged"" version which is (almost) never performed on stage, because all dramatic impact is lost.  Second, earlier on in Act 2, Siegfried spends too much time wandering around aimlessly with an exceedingly ""gay"" looking crossbow, at a time that instinct (and the music) tells you that swans should be coming on stage.  What a nuisance!  But despite its flaws (poor lighting, as another reviewer pointed out, being one of them), this is a worthwhile addition to any serious ballet fan's collection.",1120262400,,654,5.018518518518518
7978406,4,B00007M5JZ,"Several reviewers said this staging of Swan Lake was among the most beautiful they'd ever seen, and i have to agree. Nathalie Nordquist's Odile is expressive, lovely and delicate. Anders Nordstrom's Siegfried is equally well-interpreted: He displays a full range of emotions and his dancing is both technically impeccable and emotionally engaging. The corps is absolutely superb. The orchestra delivers a beautiful rendition of the evocative score. Even the evil magician is excellent!

So why am i giving it just four stars? The lighting is dreadful!! Perhaps it was adequate for the theatrical audience, but it was too dim for filming. Poor Siegfried (Mr. Nordstrom) is arguably most victimized by the lighting: Someone dressed him entirely in black and sent him onstage to dance against an equally dark background in dim light. In several instances, i gather from his wildly bobbing head and oddly disembodied flying hands that the fellow is exerting himself tremendously, but i'll be darned if i can tell -- even generally -- what steps he has executed.

Still, i don't regret having bought this DVD. I've watched it several times and it continues to leave a wonderful impression, all told. If you enjoy classical ballet, i highly recommend adding this Swan Lake to your collection... in spite of its cinematographic shortcomings, it's still a lovely new interpretation of an old standard.",1120089600,,1393,5.1866666666666665
