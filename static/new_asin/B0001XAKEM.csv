2041567,5,B0001XAKEM,"A lot of people didn't like this season, but it had its memorable moments.  Alison was a great player, and this cast had a great time.  It's always fun reliving these moments, especially with the all-star season coming up.  Get caught up w/ BB4 so you don't miss out!",1149724800,,267,4.408163265306122
2041568,1,B0001XAKEM,"After putting out a nice but not spectacular set for season 3, why would they put out a total piece of garbage like this?  Poor video, not every episode, bare bones edition.  If you don't care about the bells and whistles, at least put out all the episodes of the season in the package.  The description on Amazon is very sketchy, and only by reading the reviews do you know that it is not a complete set.",1147910400,29,405,4.233766233766234
2041569,1,B0001XAKEM,"NOT the entire series...was trying to figure out why it was edited in such a bizarre way.  It was like watching the series in fast forward.  I LOVE BB and I always wait for the DVD version, but this was a BIG disappointment.",1140825600,12,224,4.186046511627907
2041570,2,B0001XAKEM,"Big Brother 4 was the first season to introduce houseguests that already knew each other. With a twist that spawned two more seasons with similar twists, five of the eight ""original"" houseguests had ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends walk into the house as opponents. Scott's girlfriend Amanda, David's girlfriend Michelle, Jun's boyfriend Jee, Erika's boyfriend Robert, and Alison's boyfriend Justin made up the final houseguests of the season, making a group of 13. Jack, Nathan, and Dana were the only houseguests without an ex in the house. This season started out with targets on the ex's backs, but subgroups formed and created a highly entertaining, although disappointing summer.

Not only is this not the complete season of Big Brother 4, it is an incomplete promo disk for the worst season. Thanks largely to the whining annoying Alison, one cannot help but be extremely aggravated throughout the season. However, this is not the whole season. Stay away from Big Brother 4 whether it is a promo disk or the entire season.",1130025600,17,1028,5.119047619047619
2041571,2,B0001XAKEM,"This DVD set is not the complete sesaon, just a highlight reel!  What a disappointment!  Also it is clearly marked as a ""best of"" DVd on the actually packaging and that information is missing from the scan of the cover shown on Amazon!!!  I was so disappointed!  I gave the DVD 2 stars because of my general love of BB, but left off the other 3 stars that it surely would have gotten from me had it been the DVD set I thought I was getting!",1123804800,19,440,4.0813953488372094
2041572,2,B0001XAKEM,"I have not got this as BB3 box set was SO excellent.  Being in Australia, our Big Brother series is complete rubbish.  The USA Big Brother is fantastic and I can say everyone I've shown season 3 to have become addicted.

Why not release more like this.  They would certainly sell.  If the market is there, why not use it???",1112227200,5,323,4.316666666666666
2041573,1,B0001XAKEM,"I hated this season so much! I liked the other seasons, but this season was a utter disapointment. Bad casting, ending, and everything! The X-Factor twist sucked big time!

Thank God BB5 came out and it's much better than this crap. What an improvement BB5 was!",1095638400,9,261,4.673913043478261
2041574,3,B0001XAKEM,"The other reviews are criticizing it for not being the complete set, but I think it's good for what it is, which is a ""best-of"" season 4.  It's two discs, features extra footage plus newly recorded interviews with the HGs.  David and Amanda do the nasty, Nathan saves Allison then gets betrayed, Robert calls the girls names, salad bikinis...all the highlights are on this DVD.  It would be great if more Big Brother DVDs were released.",1095292800,12,436,4.7105263157894735
2041575,1,B0001XAKEM,"I preordered this dvd and waited a month for it to arrive, only to find that it has no sound!  My rating of one star is not reflective of the show itself (I love BB!!), but this dvd is crap.  I was also disappointed that it did not contain all the episodes like the BB3 dvd.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  The video quality is not great either.  Of the two Big Brother dvds CBS has released so far, both of them have been very shoddily put together.  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER CBS!!!",1086825600,50,486,4.010416666666667

8017602,2,B0001XAKEM,"I wish Create Space would start releasing seasons from this series as they have Survivor and Amazing Race.  Why they only ever released one full season that is next to impossible to find now (season 3) is a mystery and I would buy them all as I have those other series if they released them.
As advertised this unfortunately is just clips and special features and a disappointment for collectors who want the seasons on their shelves.",1390003200,,434,4.636363636363637
8017603,2,B0001XAKEM,"Seeing as this is the only ""Best of Big Brother blank"" dvd and coming after a full season release of a previous season, this dvd is a big let down for fans who want more. Had there been more dvds like this, there wouldn't as much negativity because it would be a reguler thing. Seeing as now this is one of TWO dvds released for Big Brother EVER, and it comes after a full season set, it earns bad marks from me.

But let me tell you, even if this was a complete dvd set, I wouldn't rank it any higher as I feel out of the first four seasons of Big Brother, this is the worst. Where as I'm not a big fan of 2 due to the omnipresent negative athmosphere and a winner I never completly liked, this season ended up as a major dissapointment. The twist was interesting, (but really make it even or at least 7-6 not 8-5) and the season felt fast paced and was a roller coaster as control constantly shifted. However that last praise causes one of the season's downfalls. In previous seasons I felt it took awhile for major characters to leave, here I feel they left MUCH earlier and that hurts the season.

Downfall #2 is the last veto competition, I feel as if having a final four veto does not work. Why? Because if a nominee wins it, most of the time they will save themselves and vote for the person that replaces them. To me there is far less reason to use it, in order to ensure your fellow nominee would leave. Yes there is a trust factor both ways, but still. Spoiler Alert No Names,(Yes I'm coming from a biased opinion, had the two non nominees won I wouldn't be complaining).

Finally, this seasons top two I feel suck. Now it is possible to be low key for most of the season and I'll like you and want you to win(Lisa, Monica, Robert, many Survivor people, one winner of Hell's Kitchen) but these two I didn't like nor support. Once the 3rd place person left, I stopped watching and looked up who won as I didn't care who won, that was a first, even Survivor Thiland and Marquases which I dispise I didn't skip anything, I stuck it out. Here I didn't care...

So like with Survivor Marquases and Endurance High Serrias a bad final/winner ruins what could've been a good season that turned into one bad reality season. (Bearly I would've ranked it below 3 and 1 anyway.)",1363478400,,2276,4.273781902552204
8017604,4,B0001XAKEM,"ok guys.... if yall would pay attention, when you click on bb4 to see a larger image it has 3 pics... one of which is the back cover and tells you that it is only a 2 disc set... check it out and pay attention b4 yall get mad at BB!!!",1225324800,,234,3.607843137254902
8017605,1,B0001XAKEM,"Ok, though this might not be a good season, nor be complete, you guys need to stop blaming Amazon.  Amazon is actually not responsible for the description.  CBS sends them the information about the product with the product.  Amazon then fills out the information as they are told.  They don't watch every single DVD, read every single book, and play every single game they sell so they are just as unaware as you.  If CBS says it's the complete season in the description that is what Amazon puts.  Also, don't forget, if someone adds an item to sell that Amazon doesn't already have a page for, they add the description and what not.  That appears like it might be the case for this as it's such a small, uninformative description.  Look at the description for BB3 and you'll see what I mean.  Anyway, two thumbs down for CBS cheating fans of the show!  Bad quality, and not all the episodes.  I could download all the episodes online, AND they would be better quality!",1220832000,,969,4.543352601156069

8017607,1,B0001XAKEM,"Amazon hides the fact that this is not a complete season. The DVD cover, when it arrives, very clearly states that it is a highlights DVD. Amazon has removed this statement from the DVD box that they show in the amazon listing. Shame on you.",1196035200,4,241,4.377777777777778
8017608,1,B0001XAKEM,I couldn't agree with ALL of you more. I wish I read these reviews beforehand. I just received it in the mail- all ready to watch the ENTIRE season- and realized what it was. I immediately went on-line to see if I made a mistake and ordered an edited version. I am devastated to hear that this is what CBS released. It's sad considering you can buy entire collections for almost every popular show ever put out and then some!,1162425600,3,425,4.325
8017609,1,B0001XAKEM,"BIG BROTHER 4 - it is obviously incomplete, chopped up pieces of the season's programs, difficult to follow because of the missing parts - it should have been the entire series that was on the DVD or don't make a DVD at all!",1159747200,2,224,4.232558139534884
