The first displayed is an acrobatic homemade small jet plane (12' long, 17' wingspan, 12"" engine diameter) that goes 325 mph and up to 35,000 feet.

Then on to an underwater tow sled with CO2-operated harpoon guns used in ""Thunderball."" The 20-minute fight scene took 3 months to film. The sled no longer has its electric motor, so in this DVD was towed by thin line monofilament.

""The Man With the Golden Gun"" featured a 360-degree barrel turn over water using an AMC stunt car. This feat was recreated in the DVD; precision is required - speed must be between 39.5 and 40.5 mph, and placement within 2 inches. Viewers also learn that the movie's chase scenes were done in real Bangkok traffic with a movie official following to pay off damages to damaged vehicles.

The DVD ends at the International Spy Museum in D.C. - primarily a display for real spy weapons, tools and disguises, but also featuring additional Bond regalia.",1221782400,,1093,4.767195767195767
