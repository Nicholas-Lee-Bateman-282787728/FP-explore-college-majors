6448514,2,B00KU3Y4HC,Too complicated and unbelievable.  One American president replacing another through deceit and treachery and both have expert assassins.  Nowhere as good as an earlier movie I watched over and over about an engineer who built a machine that could reply future moments over and over again and he had to regain his memory in order to save himself. Only watched the pilot.  Maybe I have been spoiled and you might find this series intriguing.,1415318400,,439,4.905405405405405
6448515,2,B00KU3Y4HC,I watched the first episode and it was beyond cheesey. The Arrow or Penny Dreadful or Marvel's Agents of Shield are all worlds above this show. Don't waste your money.,1414022400,,167,4.6
6448516,5,B00KU3Y4HC,"FANTASTIC ! Reminds me of 24 series. Action packed, and fast moving. Great fights, and character development. If you like conspiracy theories...this will keep you on the edge of your seat. I just purchased season two before they were all gone. I haven't watched season two yet. Probably will watch during holidays. <g> I hope they make season three.",1414022400,4,349,4.932203389830509
6448517,2,B00KU3Y4HC,"Strains my credulity. While in prison, guards and inmates beat this inmate to a pulp, then they beat the pulp.  But he still hops up and takes on all of them... I decided to watch something else.",1412985600,3,195,4.27027027027027
6448518,5,B00KU3Y4HC,Great spy series if you like spy series where the spy kicks the governments butt and there is nothing they can do about it!!!!!  Oh yes!!!!!!  Stuart Townsend is not bad to look at either as a super spy!!!! Watch it on Netflix first!!!,1411084800,6,235,4.318181818181818

6448530,5,B00KU3Y4HC,Season 1 of XIII was outstanding.  Season 2 was very disappointing.  Bizarre plots and strange characters in Season 2.,1428019200,2,118,5.157894736842105

6448533,1,B00KU3Y4HC,"Stuart Townsend plays a cross between Jack Bauer and Jason Borne all without the talent, script or casting.",1425686400,2,107,5.0
6448534,5,B00KU3Y4HC,"Great first season.
Unfortunately, it ends in limbo/cliffhanger -- setting up Season 2, (which I also bought, not knowing), w/ a strange change of character by one of the main characters.
And then, they seemingly fired all the writers and directors, and, using many of the same actors carrying the same  character names, they rewrote the entire premise of the show and sent the entire thing straight into the toilet.
If you don't mind the last episode ending in a cliffhanger, I heartily recommend the first season -- good acting, direction, sets and locations and lots of suspense and action. a very cohesive package.

But, like many others, I couldn't even get past the first episode of season 2, so beware.",1424908800,9,709,4.851239669421488

6448537,4,B00KU3Y4HC,as usual production companies still have not worked out how to make the speaking voices more clearly ..with all the tools at their hand they still miss the most important part of movie making...letting the actors be heard clearly,1422835200,5,229,4.897435897435898
6448538,5,B00KU3Y4HC,Very good series... one I hadn't saw before... reminds you of the 'Bourne' series... recommended watching....,1420588800,3,109,5.875

6448548,4,B00KU3Y4HC,"First off I would like to say I disagree with the earlier reviews when they said this was not worth the money.

It is true that the plot in this series can sometimes get ""weird"". However, I thought that where others were criticizing the show for its more unbelievable plot, I found it to be rather entertaining.  I don't think that anyone expects a series to be realistic. In fact, I would go so far as to say that NO series I have ever watched was totally believable. Every show has its element of ""yeah right..."" to it, and this show is no exception.  Perhaps it is because the original books were written by a Frenchman and his view of the American system is not what you would expect in a series?  In any case, I enjoyed the plot very much.  I never expected this show to raise to the level of Jason Bourne, but I don't regret purchasing the first season.",1415404800,2,859,4.277777777777778
8661721,5,B00KU3Y4HC,"Let me start by saying I never watched XIII: The Conspiracy or read the XIII graphic novel series. I only watched this series. I caught them before they were taken off of Netflix. I enjoyed the action & plot in season 1 and the pieces fell together by the end. However, I did not like Season 2. It felt like the writers were dragging out a storyline that just wasn't nearly as good. If you don't mind having a cliffhanger at the end of season 1, I'd stop there.",1526256000,,461,4.191011235955056

8661724,3,B00KU3Y4HC,"Season 1 started off good.  Was having a little hard time following the storyline.  It started getting a little crazy with Jumping around from one thing to the next.  Season 2, just went down hill.  I kept watching it, hoping that it was going to get better and it didn't.  Now, they need to do a Season 3, just to finish it. Currently watching XIII: Conspericy, which is the movie that the Series was the spin off for.  Hopefully it will shed more light.",1463788800,,455,4.357142857142857

8661727,2,B00KU3Y4HC,"This is the sort of thing that the US churns out by the bucketload:  kind of spying by numbers, super-efficient ex girl guide or something or other who was or maybe wasn't a spy or something.  The main character is a sort of spy's McGyver, but is as about as charmless as a sack of potatoes.  Acting skills are very wooden and there's just about nothing to recommend this drivel.

In the first episode he did have a love interest, of sorts, but because this has to be boring and bland, well she got to take one for the team.  I think she genuinely couldn't stand going through the motions with the lead, and I can understand why.

Apart from the fact that we're supposed to believe this person has all these hidden/dormant ex black ops type abilities, every new episode he remembers a new talent; I'd expect to see the poor sap on a cooking and gandening show next, I mean, he's done cryptography and falling down, what's next, needlepoint.  I just found this lazy way of progressing plain silly.  The story is about as rank as it comes, and has been done much better elsewhere - all of which makes this easily unwatchable.  After all, this is supposed to be one not-quite-with-us ex soldier against the collective intelligence resources of the US - and he keeps handing their bums to them on plates.  None of this rings true - gosh if he was that much of a threat, and he can clearly be found (they know where he is all the time), well, they'd go kill or arrest him and that would (thankfully) be an end to it.  Instead of which he gets away all the time, even though he seems to stay pretty much in one place.  I just didn't buy into this ability to remain invisible a lot of the time.  The president and his hangers on were about as inept a bunch of secondary characters who spent most of there time asking each other (with appropriate brooding) where this bloke is or what he's doing, and then in the next scene saying that he was picked up by face recognition software at an airport or was in a (wow, surprise) training camp for terrorists.  On home soil.  Come on, apart from anything else, if there was such a camp, it would have been closed down long since.  The political reaction to this camp's existence, for example, ranged from a quasi indignantly surprised ""what, on US soil"" to almost, laughable ""Oh, Butlins, nice to see he's joining bootcamp for a bit - we've known about that place in Montana for years"".

This is a backwoods Alabama somewhere record of really not so tough, badly dressed special forces types continually getting their bottoms smacked by a rather weedy, charmless, grey individual one who's not allowed to smlle - does a lot of brooding and pouting, and that's about it.  I mean, how gullible are we supposed to be:  one-on-one black ops v black ops should be a pretty even fight:  five or more against one is just plain silly when this character keeps winning.

This is lazy storytelling, and has nothing to recommend it - even if you can understand the poor sound production, it muddles along in its own sweet time.  Drab and utterly charmless.",1444521600,,3081,4.474060822898032
