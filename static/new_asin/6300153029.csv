211232,5,6300153029,"G.I. Joe's first two miniseries, A Real American Hero and The Revenge of Cobra, are two of the more memorable adventures of G.I. Joe, but (like just about every Sunbow miniseries) was edited when it came to home video in the 80s. Recaps and previews were removed, scenes were edited, and the ends to some scenes re-edited. Rhino has again done an excellent job, as these episodes look and sound better than ever. The A Real American Hero miniseries (commonly referred to as The MASS Device by fans) looks particularly good now, as opposed to the almost disgusting quality of the original broadcast master. The only real complaint to be had is that there are no extras, but it was made fairly clear that a set with extras would be available later on. So, if you're impatient, or want to save a few bucks, you'll never want another copy of these episodes again.",1045699200,4,859,4.620915032679738
211233,5,6300153029,"While I agree the individual episode breaks can get a little tedious with the ""GI Joe will return after these messages"" followed by ""Now back to GI Joe"" but the color and sound more than make up for it. (Of course I have a powerful home audio system ;)
I just hit the skip button at the end to move on the the next episode. I just wish the Piramyd of Darkness and all the other episodes don't get forgotten on DVD.
I'll buy every one on DVD if available.",1045440000,3,454,4.055555555555555
211234,5,6300153029,"This set is the perfect release for G.I. Joe fans and TV purists.  As these were the first 10 episodes before the series started with actual seasons, it is the perfect way to release them.  Now they can release season box sets, which, of course, would not include these episodes as they were not part of any season.  I am not sure why people would have a problem with this.  Don't wait for a season box set to get these episodes, because you can probably bet your jamies that this is the only way that these 10 episodes will be released, as they predate season one.  Sorry to run that point into the ground, but some people seem to forget this fact while unjustly complaining about it.
I was also very excited that these were not cut into whole movies, but that the discs actually preserve the complete 10 episodes (including the end credits on each episode and even the ""will return after these messages"" bits!).  While I rode home from buying this I worried breifly that they had cut them all together, but not for long, knowing well that Rhino (unlike many home-video companies that own cartoons) actually has respect for the people who made the cartoons and respect for the people who love them.",1045353600,25,1199,4.527777777777778
211235,5,6300153029,"They have finally put two the two best G.I. Joe movies ever made
on dvd and as a plus together. I had the VHS versions and they
wore out. I'm so excited they decided to release them again.
Go Joe!",1044230400,2,196,3.925
211236,5,6300153029,"This DVD starts out with two great episodes.
In ""A Real American Hero,"" the G.I. Joe team faces their greatest challenge ever. The ruthless, evil, terrorist organization named Cobra has developed a powerful device that allows them to turn objects into beams of energy and transport them anywhere in the world.
In the second feature ""Revenge of the Cobra"" Cobra commander steals a powerful device capable of changing the world's weather patterns, and uses it to launch an attack on Washington, D.C. Only the G.I. Joe team can stop him.
These two G.I. Joe movies are great and I cannot wait until more episodes from the series are released.",1043193600,9,638,4.862385321100917
211237,5,6300153029,"Along with The Transformers, this was one of my favortie cartoons ever, I can only hope that the same treatment will be give to G.I. Joe as was to The Transformers by Rhino, and that we can hope to see box sets of the G.I. Joe seasons following this one. I can't wait to see these episodes on dvd, to see Cobra Commander, Duke, and Snake-Eyes again will be fantastic. If you are a fan of G.I. Joe, this is a must, and the only way that Rhino will release more is if people buy the ones out there, so get this one and cross your fingers.",1042761600,7,536,4.018691588785047

211277,4,6300153029,"I picked this up in a moment of weakness and nostalgia for the days when terrorists wore Halloween costumes and tried to build Weather Dominators.  And you know what, they opening miniseries from 1983 and 1984 are still a lot of fun.  They follow a strict formula, Cobra builds a super weapon, then the GI Joe team must travel to the far corners of the Earth to stop them, ending with a climatic battle in Cobra's evil lair.

However the show stumbles a bit when it moves from having 5 22 minutes episodes to follow that formula to having to squeeze the whole thing into a single 22 minute episode.

So as an adult I enjoyed about half of this set but got quickly bored with the regular episodes.  But hey, for less than 10 bucks it was a good buy.",1467590400,,748,4.276595744680851

I'm looking at an ad now.  ""Not even if our tape is so affordable priced at $39.95 that every kid can own a copy?"" Scarlet asks.  In 1983 money, that was a heck of a lot.",1377734400,,360,3.8378378378378377
211321,3,6300153029,"G.I. Joe wasn't one of my favorites growing up, but I did like it, particularily because it reminded me of Transformers.  Now it reminds me even more because I can't hear characters like Cobra Commander without hearing their Transformer counterparts, and that is a good thing.  But visiting this series again, it's a little varied.  Half of the episodes on this set hold up & I would have to rank them up there with the average Transformers episode (which means I'm ranking them with the best 80's cartoon ever), while the other epsiodes are just stupid.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1-5.  The MASS Device:  Destro and Cobra Commander use an experimental machine known as the MASS device, which has the ability to transport matter to any global location, using a powerful satellite to relay the teleportation beam.  G.I. Joe must stop Cobra by creating a MASS Device of their own.  But first, they must gather the three rare elements that power the device.  What an odd first episode, mainly because they don't properly introduce you to this world.  As flawed as the Transformers pilot was, it at least properly introduced you to the characters.  This assumes you've been collecting the toys and reading the comics.  It's not terrible, but there are a couple very silly moments that drag it down (mainly at the end of part 2 & Snake-Eyes' solo bit in episode 3), & I hated how Cobra Commander & his men get captured at the end.  How exactly did they escape?  It's never revealed.  I'm glad the Nostalgia Critic came back because that means maybe he'll get around to doing a ""Raiders of the Story Arc"" on this.  I'd love to see it because it would be hilarious.  C+

6-10.  Revenge of Cobra:  Cobra has returned in force, armed with a new weapon created called the Weather Dominator, which is able to manipulate storm systems.  But when it is damaged in battle, the device breaks into its three component pieces, which scatter across the world.  The G.I. Joe team must recover the pieces before Cobra can reclaim them to rebuild the Weather Dominator.  This is everything The MASS Device should have been.  The action is better, there are no incredibly silly moments and we get a real feel for many of the characters.  Cobra Commander & the others are captured again at the end, but Storm Shadow and Firefly escape, and those two are cool enough to come up with a plan to rescue their leader.  A+

11-15.  Pyramid of Darkness:  Cobra builds a new weapon, the Pyramid of Darkness, a weapon that neutralizes all electrical power in the Earth's Northern hemisphere.  Four giant control cubes are to be placed at key locations around the globe.  Once the Joes' orbiting space station is seized, the cubes are activated and the pyramid is complete.  The Joes battle Cobra to destroy the pyramid and find the terrorist organization's secret headquarters.  The first 10 minutes or so of the first episode were good.  But then the Fatal Fluffies appeared and it was all downhill from there.  I know this takes place in the same world where giant transforming alien robots roam around but those things were just too weird and silly, as were all the battles around the cubes.  There were some good moments though.  Tomax & Xamot were cool characters, as was Quick Kick, apart from the bit where he sang; the subplot about Shipwreck & Snake Eyes (2 of my all-time favorite characters in the series) was entertaining until they disguised themselves in those horrible costumes, and as always Cobra Commander was good for a few laughs (the bit where he discusses how to introduce himself on television was hilarious, but the best was his reaction to Destro kissing the Baroness), but it's just too silly.  D+

16.  Countdown For Zartan:  Cobra sends Zartan to destroy the World Wide Defense Center, where he plants a bomb that could destroy the building in the process.  Now, G.I. Joe must foil Cobra and Zartan's plot to destroy the building before it's too late.  For the first single episode story, this is quite good.  A

17.  Red Rocket's Glare:  Roadblock's aunt and uncle run a fast food place called Red Rocket owned by Extensive Enterprises, Cobra's business alias.  The rocket design hides extremely destructive warheads that Cobra hopes to utilize.  G.I. Joe goes on a countrywide search for Red Rocket restaurants with Cobra missiles.  A weird episode, but it definitely worked for me.  Roadblock is one of my favorite characters, so it was nice seeing him get a decent spotlight.  B+

18.  Satellite Down:  military satellite crashes into the South Pacific, causing a race between G.I. Joe and Cobra to gain possession of it.  A primitive tribe finds it first, claiming it as their god.  Not one of my favorites.  C

19.  Cobra Stops the World:  Cobra uses a cloaking device to make oil tankers disappear so they can detonate them by remote in an effort to take control of the world's fuel supply, unless G.I. Joe can stop the bombings.  A well-paced and entertaining episode.  A

20.  Jungle Trap:  In a plan to attack the world's cities with lava, Dr. Shakur, a scientist who invented the Vulcan Machine, is captured by Cobra.  G.I. Joe must head into Cobra's jungle base, rescue the doctor and stop Cobra from carrying out their mission before these cities literally become ""hotspots"".  There's a reason why one of the bonus features is a script for this episode; it's really good.  I expected nothing less from Paul Dini, of Batman The Animated Series fame.  There's some great action and it gives Recondo (another one of my favorite characters) a large part to play.  A+

21.  Cobra's Creatures:  Cobra uses a special weapon called ""Hi-Freq"", a mind control device that takes over all animals in the animal kingdom, including Mutt's dog Junkyard.  Pretty good.  A-

22.  The Funhouse:  Several scientists have been captured by Cobra and imprisoned in South America, prompting the Joes to rescue them and go through Cobra's booby-trapped ""funhouse"".  Not a bad episode to end the set on.  B+

So like I said, it's mixed but worth getting.  I give it 3 stars because the good part is really good, and no matter what there's always good animation & great voice acting.  I bought Season 2 shortly after I saw the Revenge of Cobra miniseries, partially because it was on sale at the same price ($8), so here's hoping it improves some.",1371600000,,6370,4.751143641354071

211338,5,6300153029,"Here it is- the excellent series I loved as a kid & continue to enjoy today.

G.I. Joe is kind of set in today's world, except with an 80's-feel mixed with laser weapons & futuristic technology. It's essentially a kids-to-teens show, although big kids of all ages can easily, greatly appreciate this. :)

Contents include...

- The M.A.S.S. Device- Introducing G.I. Joe. The Joes & Cobra are in a race to assemble a powerful device, and this race sends them battling all across the globe. It's a 5-part, formulaic episode, which is similar in many ways to the other multi-part episodes included here. I like this, as it introduces a great many characters, yet the series really captured my attention with the great Revenge of Cobra.

- The Revenge of Cobra- This is maybe my favorite story in the entire 80's series, and it's one of my all-time favorite animated cartoons! To me, the introducing of Shipwreck with his desert sailing ship is worth the price of admission by itself. It begins with an explosive conflict in the desert as a G.I Joe convoy transporting a powerful laser-core is all-out ambushed by Cobra. We get introduced to many new colorful characters and creative action sequences. Cobra is building a weather dominator with the help of Destro, which will bring the world to its collective knees. It's G.I. Joe to the rescue!

- The Pyramid of Darkness- We see a similar, formulaic, 5-part story presented for the 3rd time. It's still entertaining as-is, yet with the risk of becoming too predictable being something to consider, it's understandable we now see the series switching to mainly single-part episodes for the rest of season 1.

The rest of this disc set is great as well. The genius voice-work of Chris Latta as Cobra Commander is one of the main reasons this series is still excellent to me. Fans with sharp ears might hear a few sound effects lifted directly from Star Wars. Many bits & pieces of 80's pop culture influenced this series. I'm thinking people will have a good idea whether they like this series or not after buying this 1st set. Starting with Season 1.1 is highly recommended.",1359158400,,2121,4.76566757493188

I loved this program as a kid but never had the chance to watch the entire series in order.

211353,5,6300153029,"The GI Joe A Real American Hero franchise (Toys, comics, and cartoons) played a huge role in my formative years. Being that I am currently member of the US Military, I frequently joke that I joined because the role that GI Joe played in my early childhood. As a kid, the GI Joe toys and cartoon ( not so much the comics because they were aimed towards a more mature crowd)were great ""inspirers"" of my imagination. I fondly remember watching the cartoons, and playing with my ""Joe's"" for hours with my friends.

This DVD set, is a great trip down ""Nostalgia"" Lane. I wouldn't call the story writing, anything to marvel at (these were specifically marketed to kids), and even the animation isn't that great compared to today's standards. If you are looking for a ""compelling"" cartoon series, you are barking up the wrong tree, and I recommend you check out Hiyao Miyazaki. However, if you put your ""5-8 year old goggles"" on, these stories are very enjoyable. Personally, as an adult I really enjoy ""travelling back in time"" and watching cartoons in the era I grew up in. I personally get great enjoyment in seeing 20 GI Joes open fire on 20 Cobras, and vice versa, with no one getting shot or seriously hurt. When watching this, you need to consider the times and the restrictions put on artist, in regards to how much violence could be depicted in cartoons, which were far more restrictive than now.  If you are looking to re-live some great memories from your childhood, this is your ticket.

The DVD set includes some cool speical features, and I really enjoyed the PSA's, 80's toys commericials, and the interviews with GI Joe writer Ron Friedman. This DVD also includes the 1963 TOY FAIR presentation, that Hasbro gave, to introduce the original 12"" GI Joe to the toy market. I thought this was a great piece of history, and something I did not expect to find in a product based upon the 3.75"" action figure line.

I really like the box packaging this DVD set comes in. After you are done watching the cartoons, you can set up the DVD set as a nice display piece.

Overall, this DVD set is pretty awesome. I will most likely picking up the rest of the ""Sunbow series"" at least. For the adult collector this is a great piece of nostalgia, for a brand you probably already like, and for a family man like myself, it is a cool way to share one of my hobbies with my kids. Definitely a great buy!",1345766400,,2395,4.509216589861751
211354,4,6300153029,"If you grew up in the 80s' like me, then I'm sure you spent some time watching the Original GI JOE series. The MASS Device is the first 5-part mini-series that aired, it was so popular it was followed next by the 5-part Revenge of Cobra (aka The Weather Dominator) and eventually a full regular series.
The Mass Device introduces us to the Joes, Cobra, Destro, and most of the characters JOE fans love (Storm Shadow isn't introduced until Weather Dominator). As I saw the MASS Device for the first time in many years, it brought me back to my childhood and hopefully it will do the same for you.
Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the DVD release format, they should released both MASS Device and Revenge of Cobra together, there is a release like that but it was discontinued.
JOE fans MUST check out GI JOE RESOLUTE. Released about the same time as the live-action film, you'll be surprised at the quality of the animation and the plot, especially when you compare it to the ridiculous Channing Tatum movie.
Thanks for reading.",1339286400,,1036,4.545454545454546
211355,4,6300153029,"This series held up to the test of remembered childhood...but not as well as I would have liked.  I guess I was recalling the era of the animated movie when I decided to buy this, not so much the first few episodes...where Snake Eyes actually joins a chorus line and break dances.  I kid you not.",1338422400,,296,4.267857142857143
211356,3,6300153029,"If you want the GI Joe cartoon on DVD, this is it, for better or worse.  If you love it and want exactly what it is, you will get it and be glad.  I was hoping to introduce some young kids to a cool old show, but when I turned it on I was surprised.

I was mostly surprised at how LITTLE military action the show has.  I guess I just never noticed as a kid.  There are so few scenes with fighter jets and tanks and guys shooting at each other from behind cover... and so many weirdo alien scenes.  The Cobra base is some kind of crazy underground temple at the earth's core, with a gigantic underground arena where 35, um... Ancient Greeks? ... watch gladatorial combat?  They need to collect some sort of goo from the bottom of the ocean and fight 100-yard long screaming (yes, screaming, even at the bottom of the ocean) sea snakes?

Why couldn't they just have battles?  I don't get it, I guess.

It was pretty awesome when Snake Eyes got punched by a 35 foot tall polar bear.  That bear was so shredded you could see his biceps and triceps.  I can't figure out how Snake Eyes survived that, but he was also glowing with bright red radiation poisoning for like, 3 episodes, until a blind Eskimo with a GREEN LIGHTING BEAR-TASER cured his extreme radiation poisoning with TEA.  Nice!!

Also nice was Scarlett screaming like an idiot at Snake Eyes on the radio.  He's mute!  Even I remembered that, but apparently they forgot to plan around that in their training.  It even has a shot of Snake Eyes staring at his radio and not responding like, ""What the ??? do I do now?""

Finally, you have to admire Cobra Commander.  He sets a reasonable goal in the pilot episode: Controlling the UNIVERSE.  Jeez, even Lex Luthor shoots for ""earth"" most of the time, and he's a heckuva lot smarter than this goofball.  I like to imagine Cobra Commander chumming it up with the Emperor from Star Wars, and the Emperor being like, ""So, how's that whole 'control the universe' thing going for you?  Not as easy as you thought, huh?""",1335312000,,2017,4.394594594594595

The only thing that was a downside was that the DVD's will stop in the middle of playing at times.  If I play the same disk again, it will still happen, but not in the same place(s), so I'm not sure if that's a reflection on my DVD player or the DVD itself.  So I can't complain too much given the price and the fact that it could be my DVD player (I haven't had a chance to try it at someone else's place with a different DVD player) means I can't really hold it against the seller.  I would give it 4.5 stars instead of 4 for this, but that's not allowed.

211377,4,6300153029,"When the ""G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero"" cartoon series premiered in 1985 it gave Hasbro and incredible one-two punch to go along with the Transformers cartoon...not only on TV but in the toy stores.  The amending of FCC laws paved the way for these shows to make it on to airwaves where previously they were banned as being nothing more than  hour-long commercials...duhhh!

This set presents the first 22 episodes of the show on four DVDs, out just in time with the major theatrical film release of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.  Like Transformers, this series hit you with an unheard of onslaught of different characters.  You know that Hasbro had to be pushing the show's writers to get as many of these guys onscreen as possible in order to sell their figures.

Early on the series was grouped into story arcs of five episodes as they were originally intended to be mini-series.  The first five episodes of the show deal with Destro's creation of the MASS device, a machine which can teleport soldiers or equipment.  While battling Cobra forces, Duke is captured and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena.  Meanwhile the Joe's have managed to build their own MASS device.  Rare elements are needed to fuel the device and the radioactive crystals nearly kill Snake Eyes.

Most of these early episodes are written by Ron Friedman who created the show for TV.  Friedman dispenses with any sort of introductions or origins with the two rival factions, assuming that most fans had probably been fans of the toys or the Marvel Comic which preceded the TV show by a couple of years.  Instead he jumps right into the fray with both bores and legion of characters at his disposal.  It's pretty obvious that certain situations were setup to make use of various characters.  For example Torpedo, the Joe's resident Navy SEAL is introduced in the third episode to retrieve one of the elements that is under water.  This is especially evident in the second 5 part story arc entitled ""The Revenge of Cobra"".  This arc introduced, in rapid fire style:  Firefly, Flint, Mutt, Roadblock, Shipwreck, Snow Job, and Wild Bill...to name a few!

The final five-part arc of the first season was the Pyramid of Darkness storyline and by now the show was off on its way in terms of popularity.  After this arc the series settles into more self-contained story arcs as new writers like Christy Marx, Paul Dini, and Steve Gerber begin penning some of the episodes.  With so many different writers the story lost a little bit of its cohesiveness but on the other hand, each had a different take on the Joe's.

The show was produced by Sunbow who also produced The Transformers (along with Japanese production company Toei).  The animation is typical for the 80's and certainly better than many others of the era.  There was obviously a huge cast of voice actors but no one did more voices than the great Frank Welker who voiced Wild Bill, Torch, Timber, Flash, Short-Fuse, and Copperhead, among others.

It's a true joy to see this show again after so many years.  It's not hard to see why it was so successful as it had all the elements kids...especially the Males of the species...really love.  At the same time it did have several strong female characters as well, something that Transformers completely lacked.  Go Joe!",1269907200,9,3302,4.745614035087719

It comes in a nice see-through jewel case; and as far as completists like myself are concerned, the picture on the disc is different than the season 1.1 first disc which holds the same material... the disc pictures three fighter jets with the jetstream smoke forming the red white and blue colors behind it; which I was excited to add to my collection, even if it's repeat content; it is possible to find the DVD for $8.27 elsewhere.

211410,5,6300153029,"A team of militant heroes codenamed ""G.I. Joe"" lead by the couragous Duke struggle to fight for the freedom of America and the world from the threat of the manicial terrorist organization known as COBRA lead by the evil Cobra Commander and steel-faced fiend Destro.

This show became one of the most iconic animated shows of the 80's besides Transformers, Real Ghostbusters and He-Man and is one of the best cartoons ever. The show is based on Hasbro's action figure series much like ""Transformers"" was in 1984 but in 1983 Sunbow/Marvel animation made three annual mini-series based on the figure series which came in 1983, 1984 and finally 1985 where it lead to a successful TV animated series that earned high ratings among people of all ages. I love how the show has smart writing including tons of action and excellent characters from sexy Baroness, beautiful Scarlett, lovable sailor Shipwreck, hard cooking and hardcore fighter Roadblock, and more which helped made this a favorite among all ages even in the 80's.

This DVD has the first three Miniseries which started with 1983's ""An American Hero: The M.A.S.S. Device"" has the debut of Destro who joins with Cobra Commander's COBRA team as they develope a powerful weapon called the M.A.S.S. Device which can beam and transport objects, buildings and even people to their place, when Cobra decides to use the thing to steal a military satellite, the JOE team is on the rescue to destroy the device. Next ""The Revenge of Cobra"" has the COBRAs attacking G.I. Joe as they hatch up another evil scheme called The Weather Dominator which is a weapon that can change the worlds's climates as now Duke, Flnt, Mutt, Roadblock, silent but deadly Snake-Eyes and of the rest of the JOEs must disconnect the weapon from harming the Earth and finally ""Pyramid of Darkness"" has deadly twins Tomax and Xamot with Cobra Commander, Destro, Baroness and the COBRAs has taken over a G.I. Joe Spaceship as they use their sattelite to create a pyramid-like zone around the world of energy to take electricity off the Earth and wants the world to be completly dark unlessJoe can do something about it. Now to the real meat where the show begins starting with ""Countdown For Zartan"" has master of disguise Cobra member Zartan who disguises himself as a French researcher and implants a bomb within the Worldwide Defense Center building for time is ticking for the bomb as the Joes must find it or else it would go into smithereens. ""Red Rocket's Glare"" has the Cobra twins Tomax and Xamot who secretly own a company has purchased the Red Rocket food chain leaving people almost out of business but using the company secretly for a missle launching base, Roadblock's uncle and aunt are in danger of losing their business unless Roadblock can straighten things out with the conspiracy the twins are scheming. ""Satellite Down"" has a secrety military satellite blown out from space until a jungle by Cobra, the Joe team with Cobra have competetion to retreive it as they meet an unsusal tribe of ape-like people that also seeks the device as well, ""Cobra Stops the World"" has Cobra Commander who has a wicked plan of control the oil supplies of the world as he detonates oil tankers and supplies with a simple remote, G.I. Joe member Sparks finds out the weird frequence Cobra is using to demolish the tankers as the Joe team use technology against technology. ""Jungle Trap"" has Cobra wanting to destroy all cities with hot lava from volcanic activity as a professor named Dr. Shakur has been kidnapped by Cobra Commandor as he's forced to use his technology to get to the Earth's core to make volcanic erruptions, the Joe must go into the jungle base of Cobra to destroy the newest weapon and save the scientist. ""Cobra's Creatures"" has a new member of Cobra named High Ferq who uses a device that controls all the animals of the world to go against humans including the G.I.

And finally ""The Funhouse"" has Flint with Bazooka, and other Joe members who are in a trap made by Cobra in a temple as they must solve a labyrinth of death and fight Cobra.

All episodes including the mini-series are digitally remastered with great picture and sound with great extras like a three part interview with one of the writers, Knowing is Half the Battle PSAs, G.I.

211412,5,6300153029,"""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" is literally the classic animated series that became an iconic series for thousands of fans who loyally collected the many awesome merchandise from Hasbro and continues to be a popular toy line today.

Although, the series was released in 1984, the series has spawned several of animated series and CG films.  In 2008, the 3 3/4 action figures and vehicle line celebrated its 25th Anniversary and in 2009, earlier in the year, fans were treated with a more darker and more violent animated series with ""G.I. Joe Resolute"" and by the Summer of 2009, would be treated with the live action film and a release of a G.I. Joe video game.

So, what better time than now but to enjoy the classic 1985 animated series through SHOUT FACTORY's ""G.I. JOE - A REAL AMERICAN HERO - SEASON 1.1"" on DVD.

The DVD release is the second release of the popular animated series (the first was released through RHINO, note: RHINO only released season 1 and the first half of season 2) and both releases has its key differences which I will discuss further in my review.  It's important to also note that some of the episodes for the first season were featured on DVD's that were included with various Hasbro toy box sets released in early 2009.

For starters, the series is not based on the original GI Joe toys that were released in the 1960's but is based on the Hasbro toyline which started in 1982 and the comic book series from Marvel Comics.  The series was created by Ron Friedman and the first season on this DVD set comprised of three mini-series that aired in 2004-2005.  The mini-series which consisted of ""The M.A.S.S. Device"", ""The Revenge of Cobra"", ""The Pyramid of Darkness"" and five separate episodes.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" is in full color and presented in Dolby Digital.  I have been asked by many G.I. Joe fans how SHOUT FACTORY's DVD's compare to the original RHINO DVD's.

In terms of video quality, there is a slight (very slight) difference between SHOUT FACTORY's picture quality and RHINO's picture quality.  SHOUT FACTORY features a little less compression it would seem.  I was comparing the scenes and it's very slight.  In fact, SHOUT FACTORY's version seems a wee bit brighter.

But I wanted to compare a scene in the first episode where Cobra Commander and Destro were overlooking a computer after they were looking at crystals for the M.A.S.S. device.  The reason I chose that scene is because it exhibits a lot of dust and scratches, compression and wanted to see if it was cleaned up.  One thing I notice that both still had similar issues but a main key difference was that the size of the dust in the RHINO version were clumpier.  Granted, its there if you pause and look at a frame but for most people, they are not going to see this.  But there was no digitally remastering for those who were interested in knowing.  The dust and scratches still exist and are part of the master.

I was also asked if the errors from the original series such as two Timbers in a scene or Scarlett sporting a mind control device (when she wasn't supposed to wear one, among a few errors from the original animation were fixed in this new release.  These errors were part of the original master and is on the final cut.  So, I doubt there will be any measures to correct those errors and that it's more than likely these will permanent errors that are part of the original animation.

I was also asked if the opening themes were the ones featured on the original broadcast.  And the opening theme for all episodes on Season 1.1 is the version with Flint pointing as starting off with his scream of ""Yo Joe!"" and ending with a large Cobra spaceship crashing into the ground.

As for audio quality, this is where the RHINO and SHOUT FACTORY versions are quite different.  The RHINO version features a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio which utilizes the surround channels and the LFE of your subwoofer and shows up on my receiver as Dolby Digital 5.1. Vocal tracks were featured on the center channel, music on the surrounds (and were louder than the dialogue track) and utilizing front channel and the subwoofer for the booms.

For the SHOUT FACTORY version, the audio is featured in Dolby Digital but does not take advantage of surround channels or LFE.  In fact, the setting I ended up choosing on my receiver was ""All Channels on Stereo"".

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""G.I. JOE - A Real American Hero - Season 1.1' comes with a good number of special features.  Included are:

DISC 1:

  * Looking Back with Writer Ron Friedman, Part One - (7:03) Ron Friedman talks about why he had a voice over on opening theme of what G.I. Joe and Cobra is.  Also, discussion of how he learned to write for children and how to get them to buy the merchandise and how he was involved with test groups for the toys.

DISC 2:

  * Looking Back with Writer Ron Friedman, Part Two - (7:03) Ron Friedman talks about how he was hired from Hasbro and how important it was for him to create the characters and get kids to enjoy the characters and buy the merchandise.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Needless to say that I am quite biased when it comes to ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"".  As a child who collected the comics and toys, as an adult, I still own many of the figures, vehicles and and box sets released from 1982 through the present.  So, personally, the animated series will always be close to my heart as it was very much an important part of my childhood.

Like many people who grew up during the early 80's, ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" was an animated series that grabbed our attention because of its many characters and the personality of those characters.

Each character looked different, had different skills, various weaponry and attitude and Hasbro was quite innovative with the release of the toys.  The animation encouraged us to enjoy them even further by establishing storylines that we could try to recreate.  The series was the classic good vs. evil storyline and it's one thing to have these various members of G.I. Joe but the whole look of Cobra was just too cool to ignore.

Needless to say, part of the success and why parents loved about ""G.I. Joe"" was the fact that the action figures were significantly cheaper than other toy lines (with the exception of a few vehicles or play sets such as the USS Flag which were quite expensive) and they were easily accessible at your local mom and pop drug store or grocery store.

Children would know that if you bought a character, chances are that you would see this character in action on an episode of ""G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero"" unlike other toylines at the time which unfortunately, you would see only once in an animated series and never see again.

As for the animation and its re-release, with the release of the RHINO DVD's over five years ago, it was a bit unfortunate that the company didn't finish the series when it was released. This left a lot of G.I. Joe fans frustrated and upset.

To add to the frustration, the box sets became out of print so quickly that fans only chance of obtaining the series was through eBay and paying nearly double or triple of what the original mini-series and the individual season box sets cost.  Needless to say, the RHINO releases were just too difficult for fans to get a hold of and priced too high for any casual fan or newbie fans to want to pay and buy for it.

But in 2009, SHOUT FACTORY has done a great service for G.I. Joe fans.  Fans can get the first 22 episodes with ""G.I. JOE - A REAL AMERICAN HERO - SEASON 1.1' and the complete series for a magnificent price.

For those who are wondering if the series is worth the double dip, my answer is that if you want the complete series, you're going to have to anyway (since RHINO never released the second half of Season Two).  I do miss the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio from the original from the RHINO release but overall, there is nothing I can complain about with SHOUT FACTORY's Season 1.1 release.  There are enough bells and whistles included on a thin pack and really, for the price these will be sold for, compared to the experience that fans had to go through years ago, this is a steal!

G.I. Joe or Cobra the enemy fans, this is one release that you won't want to miss.  ""G.I. JOE - A REAL AMERICAN HERO - SEASON 1.1"" is highly recommended!",1247443200,125,14208,4.4683002722676

The stories is the box set is kid and adult friendly. Adults will not be bored with these half hour adventure shows. We need to feed the children of America this sort of  action show, it has possitive messages and well as good action

In watching the old Rhino box set, It is a great animated show that should have been rereleaed to DVD long ago..rather than waiting until the new GI JOE action film coming summer this year.

211438,5,6300153029,"G.I. Joe: A REAL AMERICAN HERO is the thrilling five-part adventure that kicked off the legendary animated series that dominated weekday afternoon television in the mid 1980s.  The excitement begins when the sinister, eye-patch-wearing Major Bludd leads the villainous forces of Cobra in a surprise attack on the G.I. Joe base, the purpose of which is to destroy as many Skystriker jets as possible in preparation for Cobra's planned robbery of the experimental Relay Star Satellite.  By forcibly picking the brain of renowned scientist, Dr. Lazlo Vandermeer, the Cobra Commander's steel-faced partner-in-crime, Destro, gained the knowledge required to construct an awesome teleportation weapon known as the MASS device.  The MASS device can blast a monument like the Eiffel Tower into microscopic molecules, turn them into a beam of pure energy, and reassemble them in another location.  However, in order to take full advantage of the MASS device's terrifying potential, Destro needs the U.S. Government's Relay Star--a satellite that can send and receive energy to any place at any time.  Tragically, when MASS's electric blue beam envelops the Relay Star, beloved Joe leader, Duke, stumbles into it and winds up battling a barbarian giant in Cobra Temple's dreaded Arena of Sport.

The original G.I. Joe mini-series is beautifully animated and loaded with fast-paced action scenes, super-cool vehicles, unforgettable characters and wall-to-wall red and blue laser fire.  The second five-part story, THE REVENGE OF COBRA, is extremely similar, plot-wise, and features even cooler vehicles and an even larger cast of Joes and Cobras, including: Flint; Lady Jaye; Roadblock; Shipwreck; Storm Shadow; Zartan and the Dreadknocks...just to name a few.  This time around, ol' tin head (Destro) is out to get G.I. Joe's awesome new Laser Core so he can finish constructing his incredible Weather Dominator machine.  If they were nice people, Destro and the Commander could use this device to end Global Warming once and for all; but these diabolical fiends are most definitely NOT nice.  They plan to fool Mother Nature into unleashing her stormy wrath all over the planet, thereby bringing the world's leaders to their collective knees.  Luckily, the intrepid G.I. Joe team is on the case--they may not be perfect, but they do OK!

Now, for your enjoyment (hopefully), here are my favorite quotes from the first two G.I. Joe epics:

With the beginning of these simple lyrics my Saturday mornings were never the same. I would rush to the television with my box of Frosted Flakes and pensively wait until I would see the blue of Cobra's shirts. Excitement would build, and I would be ready for the most engaging, most entertaining, most spectacular cartoon of the 80s. While some would follow as being ""great"" shows as well, G.I. Joe was the one that took the cake for young me. I would sing the songs, play with my figurines, and imagine that Cobra was crawling through my backyard ready to be attacked at any moment by my band of American rebels.

Ahhh, that was the life. Years later and I dare say ""years"" later, I found this series on Amazon, and I had to immediately purchase the set. To begin with, it came with an action figure, and my inner-child was already screaming on the floor begging my wife to buy it for me. When I got it home, I nervously opened the box, unsure as to what other memories of my childhood may escape the vault, I prepared for a cheap version of my childhood delight. To my surprise, it was outstanding. This is a great buy for anyone that remembers this program as well as I did growing up.

To begin, the transfer is outstanding. The sound is beautiful and it nearly felt as if those pesky gun-lasers were firing out of my television. It even includes (which some may find annoying) the original commercial breaks, which I only found more nostalgic. The two five-part ""films"" represented some of my favorite moments of G.I. Joe history. For those of you unfamiliar with the essentials of G.I. Joe, I have compiled a small list that will not only help you as you gather more about this program, but also as you buy this series.

1) There is a G.I. Joe named ""Snowjob"".

2) Cobra's weaponry never pierces the Joe's machines, yet only one shot from the G.I. Joes can send a Cobra vehicle into a million pieces.

3) More weaponry is used in one episode than the entire Iraq conflict

4) Destro's head will not rust, even in the rain.

5) Cobra is one of the most brilliant terrorist organizations around. Their knowledge of science is impeccable and should be studied more often in the college setting. The G.I. Joes do not have such smarts, but they can surely beat up the Cobra plan in a heartbeat.

6) Cobra infantry do not know how to aim.

7) No laser-bullet is wasted by a G.I. Joe.

8) Yes, there is a three way going on between Destro, Major Blood, and the Baroness (and later possibly Dr. Mindbender).

9) Every time (without question) the G.I. Joes do something good, they have to shout ""YOOO JOE"" no matter how many good things they hear in a matter of minutes.

10) I repeat, there is a G.I. Joe named ""Snowjob"" (Is anyone else laughing hysterically?)

Overall, this was a beautiful series that finally got the respect that it deserved. Thank you RINO for releasing this amazing package and for the products that you continually revitalize. G.I. Joe was a life-altering series, and I cannot wait to get my hands on more!

211467,5,6300153029,"Nearly every American male who was between 5 and 12 years old in 1983 and 1984 remembers the first two miniseries based on the popular G.I. Joe toy line.  What is most striking about the shows 20 years later is how relentless the action is.  It simply doesn't let up.  Writing in that way must have been a chore!  One of the coolest things about G.I. Joe at the time of its release was the care that went into developing the characters.  While this feature does not seem out of the ordinary these days, back then most cartoons were still 10 minute Hanna-Barbera vignettes or really lame adaptations of video games that were limited by the medium they borrowed from.  The motivations of the characters were never questioned or discussed.  G.I. Joe, on the other hand, as well as the toy based Transformers and to a lesser extent He-Man, spent more time on exploring broader themes.  It is for this reason that many of us still remember many of the characters, while we do not have a clue who was in Mr. T's posse.

Also noteworthy are the interviews with two G.I. Joe creators.  Marv Wolfman accompanies the first series and discusses a number of important aspects of the show.  First, he answers critics in the 80s who derided the show as a 30 minute commercial for the toy line.  While defending the creative license Hasbro gave to the creators, he also recognizes that the show was designed to give the action figures personalities.  He also goes into the difficulties of presenting a mature theme, war, to young children.  In this discussion, he mentions how the zeitgeist of the American public during the Reagan era allowed the presentation of these themes once again after a long latent period following the Vietnam War.  Of particular interest is how the writers dealt with the cost of combat, essentially, they ducked it.  The guns were actually laser rifles, and pilots of shot down COBRA planes were always shown parachuting to safety.

now on to my favorite  and not-so-favorite parts of the disc set...
the  enclosed booklet pertaining to  gijoe's history was very informative dispite a mistakes. I.E. Mego was not responsible for the six million dollar action figure, it was hasbro's once rival and parent company; KENNER who manufactured not only the six million dollar man toyline but star wars as well.
the interviews were ok, i loved ron friedman's perspective (or retrospective) regarding the series he helped define. on the other hand, i didn't care much more for marv wolfman's interview..too many ""er's and ah's""  and LASERS IN THE NIGHT was one of the worst epidsodes of the 1985-1986 series.
one thing i would have loved to have seen was the animated comic book commercials not only were they cool, but most were better executed than the regualer gijoe epidsodes. please rhino, put those awesome 20 spots in the next 2 disc installment plus add commentary from ron friedman, he had plenty to say unlike wolfman. props to the late archie goodwin of marvel comics who created the concept of joe's arch nemises COBRA.
I love the opening sequences of all the joe series. I.E. zartan has one of the joes running until recondo jumps outta knowhere and kicks zartan where the logo/title appears. how cool was that?",1054166400,8,1659,4.910714285714286
211473,5,6300153029,"When the original G.I. Joe miniseries were (finally) released on DVD in their original, uncut form in February, the Joe-watching public was promised a follow-up release with special features. That set (which you see now) has turned out to be well worth the wait.
Firstly, the packaging is more deluxe than the earlier release, and includes a booklet with a layman's history or G.I. Joe in general. Additionally, there's a Snake Eyes figure-a repaint of the original (more or less), with Timber (again, sort of, as it's not the original Timber mold from the '80s), which mimics the midnight blue color scheme from the MASS Device miniseries. The only drawback is that the packaging hypes Snake Eyes as ""one of the premier characters"" released in connection with the 1983 A Real American Hero miniseries-something that is far truer about Duke, who spent 1983 as the line's primary mail-in exclusive before being released in stores and was the star of the MASS Device episodes.
Second, of course, are the episodes themselves, which are the A Real American Hero and Revenge of Cobra miniseries, completely restored and remastered (and excellently so, at that). If you purchased the previous release, you know what you're getting here.
The last part of this set are interviews with writers Marv Wolfman and Ron Friedman. Wolfman's interview certainly informative, emphasizing the freedom he had while working for Sunbow (and equally emphasizing that character development is why Joe succeeded, in addition to that creative freedom), and how the toy companies might benefit from allowing that freedom to return in their cartoons. He also admits freely to liking Quick Kick (whose development he was most responsible for) and Cobra Commander, which is no surprise given how much fun he had with them in ""Lasers in the Night"" (an episode Wolfman is understandably proud of). The rest of Wolfman's interview discusses his politics and the politics that allowed for the '80s success of G.I. Joe, with a few jabs at the lesser cartoons of the '70s for good measure. Friedman's interview is, simply put, a trip. His comments are often funny (like the example slamming Kevin Costner's Robin Hood movie as a violation of the spirit of a popular franchise), and certainly worth viewing. He does seem to take a bit more credit for creating the series than some would like (including taking a direct jab at the old filecards), but he does illustrate the key points in how he wrote the initial miniseries very well, and in very entertaining fashion. This interview alone is probably reason enough to buy the set if you purchased the version without special features. All in all, another excellent job by Rhino.",1052784000,36,2692,5.011160714285714
211491,4,6300153029,"i remember as a kid watching the miniseries with such glee and astonishment, the opening was sooo cool especially the part where stalker grabs the bomb from cobra and shoots it while airborne via J.U.M.P. pack. the animation was top notch except for the last epidsode (stake in the serpent's heart) i guess the japenese animators had to make that deadline. lol
sure no one got shot, sunbow/marvel had to follow the FCC's rules of standards and practice(although there is a scene where a cobra trooper falls off a cliff in the second epidsode.) more like one of the first 30 minute commercials promoting the awesome toys at the time. ..
too bad the series was cancelled after 2 seasons, and the MOVIE did nothing to save the series,it probably was the nail in the coffin..the DVD is bare bones meaning no extras, they (rhino) shouldv'e at least put those classic animated comic book commercials in between each epidsodes, GIJOE spots and tv series had the coolest jingles.  a underground punk band the minibosses did a cool cover based on gi joe's all too familiar theme. and it rocks!!!",1050969600,4,1086,4.746031746031746
211492,4,6300153029,"I'm a big fan of G.I.Joe, and would jump at the chance to buy this DVD, buuut, i tell you guys to hold off till sometime in May. Why you ask? Well if you check the Rino website, they will be re-releasing this dvd with... get this... a Snake eyes G.I.Joe!!!! Oooh boy. I'm not sure if it's a 3 3/4 size g.i.joe with all the twistable arms, and knees with the normal crotch, like those from 85' But i'm sure willing to take that chance.
Yo Joe!",1050710400,7,442,4.034090909090909
211493,2,6300153029,If your a hard core joe fan you might not mind forwarding through the ends and beganings of every 30 min episode. Its really a pain in the but and rhino should have taken care of it. they also did this with thier transformers before hand. the only up side is the qaulity of the picture since it was restored and put on a dvd.,1050192000,3,325,4.015384615384615
211494,4,6300153029,"The 1980's were dominated by two children's cartoons, the Transformers and G.I. Joe.  G.I. Joe ""The Real American Hero"" followed the adventures of an elite military force dedicated to protecting the world (and America) from the forces of evil (in the form of terrorist organization Cobra).  In the midst of all this a TV series ran for several seasons in first run as well as re-runs and millions of toys were sold.  Finally, after 20 years, the two original mini-series that began the Mania are finally released on DVD.
This two-disc set collects the first two G.I. Joe mini-series (5-parts each) that aired in the 1983 and 1984.
Disc 1:  Mini-Series One - A Real American Hero (AKA ""The Mass Device"") (1983)
This is the story arc that introduced the world to the Joes and intros most of the main characters.
THE STORY:  Cobra has stolen a device (""The Mass Device"") that can automatically transport anything, anywhere.  Can the Joes stop Cobra and the Mass Device from destroying the world?
Disc 2:  Mini-Series Two - The Revenge of Cobra (AKA ""The Weather Dominator"") (1984)
This story arc sees Cobra returning to wreak more havoc than ever and introduces even more Joes and Cobra (Zartan and the Dreadnoks)
THE STORY:  Cobra and Destro have built ""The Weather Dominator,"" a device that gives them control over the weather and uses the forces of nature to destroy the world.  But what happens when Cobra loses control over their own device?  Can the Joes save the world before the world destroys itself?
THE COOL STUFF:
Easily the best feature of the DVD is the series itself.  Not a bad deal where you get nearly 4 hours of action for the relative cheap price of the DVD.
THE CRITICISM:
Too bad there's no DVD extras, although from my understanding another set of these will be released with them (thus potentially negating the reason to purchase THIS set if you are into the extras).
THE VERDICT:
Well conventional wisdom says (if rumors hold true) to hold off on this set and get the deluxe set with the extras HOWEVER, this set is still a bargain at the relatively cheap price and may be the better purchase depending on the extras that come with the other (remember the ... extras on the Transformers movie DVD???).
Highly Recommended purchase (with or without the extras, for all fans)",1050105600,29,2294,4.724310776942356
211495,4,6300153029,"In today's comic book and toy/action figure industries, there has been a serious influx of 80's nostalgia.  From Transformers and He-Man to Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake, all those old favorites are back.  Personally, the most enjoyable and satisfying has been the exceptional updating of Masters Of The Universe.  G.I. Joe, however, didn't quite return to my favor despite being a major passion of mine as a child.  The initial comic books released by Devil's Due were mediocre, as were the unimpressive paint and sculpts of the new Joe toys from Hasbro.
I remember being in the first grade and promising myself I would always buy toys, even when I got older.  I could envision bookshelves proudly displaying, specifically, my G.I. Joe action figures.  This double DVD set of the first two animated Joe miniseries brought me back to those wonder years and reminded me exactly why I made such a promise.  It wasn't simply that toys just look cool and I'll always be a big kid at heart.  It's also about the story and characterization (as complex as both may or may not be) of the likes of G.I. Joe.  Lincoln Logs and Legos are a hoot, but they don't exactly have histories and personalities behind each and every piece, do they?  The cartoons on this DVD re-introduce us to those glorious icons of Joe lore.  Duke, Scarlett, Destro, Zartan and his Dreadnoks, Flint, Baroness, Roadblock, Cobra Commander, Spirit, Storm Shadow, and the perennially popular Snake-Eyes, among others, are all present and accounted for.  While not much time is spent on in-depth characterization (which was to be found later in the ongoing animated series), every hero and villain of note gets off at least a couple of lines to establish their role and identify them seperately from other characters.  In the 1980's, this worked well to help sell action figures.  Today, it's a great re-primer.  For example, I didn't recall Shipwreck being such an interesting character.  In ""The Revenge Of Cobra"", Shipwreck comes into the story first as an outsider, a bit of a wild card/rogue, and alligns himself with G.I. Joe.  At the age of 27 today, I previously only recalled him as just another face in the crowd dressed up like a member of the Village People.  Now, 'wreck is one of my personal favorites.  It's just one of the benefits of strolling down memory lane with this set.
As for the actual material on ""G.I. Joe: Real American Hero/The Revenge Of Cobra"", you get the two miniseries broken down into each individual chapter just as they aired on weekday afternoon television, complete with the opening/closing credits and commercial breaks (minus actual commercials, of course).  The first miniseries stars the earliest Joe and Cobra characters (Duke, Snake-Eyes, Scarlett, Stalker, Cobra Commander, Destro, Major Blood, etc..), as the baddies craft something called the MASS device to wreak havoc on the world.  The heroes scramble around the world to counteract Cobra, culminating in the first of many ""final"" battles at Cobra HQ.  Significant sub-plots include Duke's romance with a female Cobra slave and Snake-Eyes being contamined by radiation, leading to his first encounter with his pet wolf, Timber.  The second miniseries brings in more of the classic names (Flint, Lady Jaye, Roadblock, Spirit, the aforementioned Shipwreck, Storm Shadow), with Cobra returning to similiar methods as in the first mini, this time brandishing the ""Weather Dominator"".  G.I. Joe once again chases them around the Earth to a new Cobra snake-hole.  Sub-plots of note include Shipwreck's introduction, Roadblock teaming up with a truck-driving Southern belle while the prisoners of Cobra, and Spirit and Storm Shadow doing battle and earning each other's respect as warriors.  From the first chapter of ""Real American Hero"" to the last of ""The Revenge Of Cobra"", this is a ride of purely guilty pleasure, heavily influenced by super-hero comics, classic sci-fi and adventure serials, and of course, military intrigue.  Hokey, unrealistic military intrigue, but still a blast, nonetheless.
While it may be a tad disappointing for DVD's to be released minus any extras, considering extras are one of the main selling points of DVD's and helped to push them ahead of VHS, this is one instance where it's nearly completely forgivable.  The cartoons are remastered, looking and sounding like brand new.  The fact that they are presented in their original format, with the credits and breaks, further helps to complete the trip back in time.  I'm sure not everyone will have the same experience as I did with G.I. Joe: Real American Hero/The Revenge Of Cobra.  You really need to be a child of the 80's to have a true understanding and appreciation of it.  However, it can still be entertaining for anyone, old and new fans alike.  If the current Joe toys and comics don't do it for you (which, honestly, are starting to shape up a bit, after their first re-launch), this DVD set should most assuredly do the trick.",1049500800,7,4985,5.003636363636364
211496,4,6300153029,"I'm glad to see g.i.joe on dvd it's one of my all time favorits. But the dvd is not perfect, there are no extras at all, allthough I am glad the see that they remasterd it.

211497,5,6300153029,I think this is sweet.  I hope though that they will also come out with the series in seasons after these mini-series.  Also I hope that rhino will buy rights to other old favorites like thundercats and maybe even the original he-man.,1048032000,,234,4.5476190476190474
211498,5,6300153029,"I don't even have this new 2-disc G.I. JOE: THE ORIGINAL MINISERIES set, and I wish I did. The miniseries on this set are A REAL AMERICAN HERO (aka THE M.A.S.S. DEVICE) from 1983, and THE REVENGE OF COBRA (aka THE WEATHER DOMINATOR) from 1984. Both of them are digitally remastered from their original versions and remixed in Dolby 5.1 sound. The openings/closings and commercial bumpers are all there, too. Rhino did a fantastic job for releasing two of its TRANSFORMERS: GENERATION ONE DVD box sets. As a fan of G.I. JOE, I love its traditional theme music. I just wish I had that set, but my mom won't buy it for me because she says I'm ""too old for cartoons."" But when it comes to an '80s icon, I go buck wild!",1047081600,,714,4.37593984962406
211499,5,6300153029,"I was pleased to learn of this set coming out several months ago.  I'd been picking up Rhino's Transformers box sets and couldn't have been more pleased to see that they were adding GI Joe to the mix.
This set contains the original two mini-series' of the show.  The first one was aired in 1983 and the second one in 1984.  GI Joe hadn't become a regular series until 1985, so these actually pre-date the daily afternoon series.  Personally, I hadn't seen them since they had originally aired, as they were not part of the daily TV series rotation back then.
The restoration is great.  Bright colors, no dirt that I can see on the film, and fantastic sound over our stereo system.  I'm a little puzzled as to why the recaps of each episode, though, were not restored.  You can see the difference.  Perhaps the episode recaps were added at the last minute.
Some reviews complain about the series recaps, opening and closing credits, commercial bumpers, and so on, but I feel that they help add to the nostalgia of it all.  That is the whole reason we are watching this stuff, right?  I think it's the right way to go, as it just wouldn't feel right without them.  Though it wouldn't hurt Rhino if they put an option in there to cut them out, for those who complain about them.  For me, though, they are every bit as much of a part of it as the rest of the show.
Overall, I certainly recommend that any fan of this classic cartoon and toy line pick this one up.  You'll enjoy it.  Plus, if this sells well, the regular series boxed sets can't be far behind.
Thanks, Rhino, for bringing GI Joe and Transformers cartoons back to my television screen!",1046476800,8,1646,4.425249169435216
211500,5,6300153029,"As I was watching Rhino's excellent DVD of the first ""G.I. Joe"" mini-series, it struck me how easy it would be to adapt the adventure into a live action film. With sophisticated CGI capabilities these days, it would finally be feasible to portray the swooping Skystrikers, menacing tubeworms, and legions of fanatical Cobra infantrymen. And just picture a realistic Cobra Temple, complete with M.A.S.S. device! The story is all there; Duke's daring escape from Cobra's Arena of Sport (as opposed to the Arena of Lunch?), Snake-Eyes' sacrifice to save the other Joes from radiation poisoning, and the dramatic showdown at an active volcano. The only piece missing is a top-notch cast, and I have some thoughts in that area:
Duke - Aaron Eckhart
Scarlett - the cute intern from the Dell commercials (just dye her hair red)
Snake-Eyes - Ray Park
Stalker - Omar Epps
Destro - the Rock
Baroness - Catherine Zeta-Jones
Major Bludd - Steve Buscemi
Cobra Commander - David Spade
I also watched the second disk in the set,""the Revenge of Cobra,"" (the one with the Weather Dominator) and have some ideas for characters like Blowtorch and Snow Job (don't mix up those code-names), but I'll save those for another review! Yo Joe!",1046131200,5,1217,4.912621359223301
