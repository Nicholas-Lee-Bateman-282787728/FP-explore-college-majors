2090465,5,B0002F6BFG,A friend of mine was telling me about this classic Farsi movie so I was pleased when it was available on Amazon. I purchased it as a gift and it was well received.,1372464000,,163,3.9696969696969697
2090466,5,B0002F6BFG,"This movie runs along the certain symbolism of traditional Persian poetry that so often speaks of the lover becoming the object of his/her love and the dissolving of one's identity in the Beloved. The film is rife with symbolism with it's dark ambiance, stark simplicity, juxtaposition of life and death, marriage and separation, friends and foes and so on.

The film was seen as an embarrassing portrayal of how Iran's rural population lived during the days of the Shah and indeed the Shah banned the film. It was only until the Iranian Revolution when Khomeini allowed it to be distributed once more. The film is seen by some as a criticism of modernity encroaching on village life and by some others as a nostalgia for a way of life slowly slipping away from us.

All in all, an exceptionally well done film that never gets 'old.'",1288569600,11,833,4.698630136986301
2090467,5,B0002F6BFG,"""The Cow"" (Gaav) is arguably the masterpiece of Dariush Mehrjui and one of the best films in the history of Iranian cinema--a stylistic cinema which has already achieved so much internationally. Made in 1969, the plot of the film comes actually from a segment of the remarkable novel, ""The Mourners of Bayal,"" written by Iranian playwright and psychotherapist Gholam Hossein Saedi (1935-1985). Saedi co-wrote the screenplay with Mehrjui, and the result is this outstanding film.

The film depicts the human situation living in utmost poverty and dispossession. Masht Hassan loses his only possession and his only source of living, his cow. Then in the unfolding process of mourning his cow, he gradually identifies with the dead animal... indeed, he becomes the cow. His insanity invokes a chain reaction on the part of his fellow villagers who at first try to help Hassan out of compassion but gradually and unconsciously begin treating him like a cow out of fear of such metamorphosis and reincarnation. The result is this starkly depicted human tragedy. It is a must see for anyone seriously thinking about social issues as well as about cinema.

The film also depicts the underlying animistic beliefs of rural Iran--a prevalent belief that has been hidden and working under the surface of Islamic beliefs. The identification of man and animal, and that there is an animal soul for humans, comes from polytheistic Indian cultures, which after the Mongol conquest and throughout centuries has permeated Persian cultures and belief systems.

This film also features the fabulous congregations of Iran's most outstanding actors of the time, Ali Nassirian, Ezzatollah Entezami, and Jamshid Mashayekhi. Their acting is super, the ambiance surreal, the situation heart-wrenching.

This will be a memorable film for anyone who hasn't yet seen it.",1201651200,34,1842,5.276450511945392

2090510,4,B0002F6BFG,"Talk about unhollywood! Very simple allegorical story of a man's relationship with his one cow and how his life and those of his fellow-villagers are affected by it.  What makes the movie work is its very simplicity and unpredictablity. The print isn't very pristine and the images look muddy, but I'd highly recommend it.",1433721600,,322,4.962962962962963

2090512,4,B0002F6BFG,"This is not a movie for everyone.  If you are into cultural, foreign, and period black & white movies with subtitles, then please watch it.  There is so much caring, social values and humanistic traits from the good, bad and ugly in this film.  A small village deals with everyday life's hardships, the threat of neighboring tribes and solving problems as a community with simplistic methods.  Hassan loves his cow more than anything in life and when faced with the worst of outcomes, succumbs to a not so good ending.  What is so endearing and mesmerizing is how much the village tries to help a helpless man.  It is almost Shakespearean  in that one deceit leads to many, many more.  It is really fascinating to watch how the social hierarchy plays out.  Everyone looks to the leader for answers and the leader is but a mere man like everyone else. There is no difference between this small village in a time long ago and small towns today.  If this appeals to you, then please watch it.",1430006400,,989,4.568181818181818

2090515,5,B0002F6BFG,"I watched once a video that takes a scene from Gaav and replaces the dialog with a fake one. You could say that it looks funny while the movie is too tragic to make fun of it; but this video is emphasizing a political level in a movie with so many levels of understanding.

And it is a political level in Gaav, no doubt about it: think only about the menacing apparitions of the robbers from the neighboring village, and the revenge incursions: they are the robbers, we are only protecting our assets and lives; it sound very Mid East indeed.

Dariush Mehrjui returned to Iran after studying philosophy at UCLA and started to make movies. It was in the sixties, Iran was under Shah's regime, and Mehrjui was one of the guys from the westernized elite. So you could expect from him movies within some American standards.

Well, Gaav, made by Mehrjui in 1969, is very far from any American artistic frame. You could think at Italian Neorealism and French Avant-Garde. I would rather say Pasolini: Gaav calls Pasolini's works in mind. However, beyond any comparison, for a Westernized viewer the subject is so Iranian specific that the typical reaction would be stupor. And to say Iranian specific is actually misleading! A remote primitive village where a symbolic story takes place. Gaav has the structure of a ballade. Think at Parajanov! It is made with extreme simplicity and economy: things happen just because that's the way they should happen, reasonable explanations are useless.

No wonder Gaav was banned immediately by Shah's censors: how to allow a movie about an Iranian village so far from modernity? The movie was smuggled in 1972 and presented at Venice at the Mostra. Without subtitles. No need of them, anyway: the images, and that unique rhythm as of a ballade were speaking for themselves.

Mehrjui went on making movies. He left later Iran, for France, he made movies there. And after some years he came back to Iran, for homesickness. He's been going on with making movies ever since.

They say Ayatollah Komeini renounced to ban movies in Iran after watching Gaav - I don't know whether it's true, but, if it is, it means that the Ayatollah had a great taste! Because it's much easier to be revolted by the movie! The subject is as simple as it can be: there is a village, poor and primitive, Hassan is the only one possessing a cow in the village, the cow dies, Hassan gets mentally insane.

Is Hassan mad? Well, obviously. A man who believes that he is no more himself, but his cow, that's madness on all accounts.

Madness? Hassan was living in his own universe ignoring the real world. But here's the point: Hassan had always lived in his own universe - he and his cow. A whole system of memories: events lived together. Natural phenomenons lived together and having a particular significance for them: a whole system of codes and signals. Was it full moon? It meant the cow was thirsty.

This universe could not disappear once the cow was no more. The memories were still in place. The codes and signals were still in place. Was it full moon? It meant the cow was still thirsty.

So Hassan was just defending now this universe of him; only his universe was no more fit with the world. Hence, the madness.

Usually, when the beloved one is no more, the survivor is tempted to imagine that the other is still somewhere, not far. You go to the cemetery and speak to your beloved one, who is buried there. Hassan was trying something more forceful: to imagine that he, Hassan was somewhere, not far, and that the cow was here, in his body, instead of him! I know how it sounds, but it was Hassan's way to keep his universe.

Meanwhile life was going on in this village. A bunch of clay houses surrounding a small dirty pool. Old men chatting at some kind of a tea house, old women attending silently the daily events and waiting for the outcome, the village idiot tortured by kids for mere distraction, the nightly incursions of neighboring villagers: just a small closed universe around a small dirty pond.

Faced with the sudden madness of Hassan, the community comes to help, with great kindness and patience, to discover that help is sometimes useless and that kindness and patience ultimately have limits.

A tragic ballad telling us that some things happen just because that's their way to happen and nobody could change anything.",1421625600,4,4358,4.6797385620915035

2090546,5,B0002F6BFG,"This is a story about the people in a small village in a desolate part of Iran that has fallen on bad times. The central character is the man who loved his cow (hence the title).  His cow was the only one in the village, which lost its sheep to thieves. I was intrigued by how the people in the village, as a village, coped with his eccentricity.  I found it touching and intensely interesting.  Definitely not a film for the average American viewer - this film is not fast or action-packed and it does not have a happy ending.  It depicts a few days in the life of these villagers...  This film stayed with me for a few days - it prompted interesting discussion with my husband and friends (who are from India) who saw the film with me.
One negative is the sound quality.  The voicing was obviously done in a space that echoed...  A minor issue...",1377129600,4,848,4.29559748427673

The acting, particularly of the main character, Hassan, is extraordinary.  The film work, the depiction of the village, and the treatment of the people who live there, is superb;  sensitive and always visually interesting.  The subject-matter, too, is a challenging theme, worth your thinking about, and is dealt with by the director in  a very intelligent way.  A must-see film for anyone interested in quality, no-nonsense film-making.  Sub-titled in English.  In every respect this film is a long way above the standards set by Hollywood.",1377043200,6,717,5.156521739130435

8027639,1,B0002F6BFG,"If you are contemplating watching a movie that is culturally and cinematically unique, shot in B&W/small screen format, with minimal, sub-titled, dialogue, I am guessing the subject matter is what has attracted you.  That was the case with me.  I found the theme -- HUMAN CHERISHING  (""more than anything else in the world) A COW ""(beings exploited, tortured and killed by the millions in most cultures) FASCINATING.

The simplicity of the movie and Hassans relationship with the cow is alluring and at times heartwarming but SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT. unfortunately for this movie both are short lived.  Once the cow dies and it becomes obvious that it was actually killed (as in murdered) during the production of the movie, the honestly of theme is lost; simplicity becomes bad acting in a dis-jointed boring story.

So I wonder if the people in those kinds of village are really that naive/crazy/stupid or if that was just some kind of built-in prejudice on the part of the movie's writer/director.",1440892800,,530,4.353535353535354
