8518845,4,B007K7IBSY,Interesting to watch.  This DVD brings back so many memories of my youth when I would sit and watch a TV show that would put us in touch with the entertainers of that era.  The picture quality is generally mediocre.  It's too bad that there aren't pristine prints available of this show.  I think that this is a one time watch for me.,1418860800,4,334,4.253968253968254
