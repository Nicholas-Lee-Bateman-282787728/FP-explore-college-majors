8558874,1,B00AXGX47M,"Why does Amz continue to allow this Desert Island Classics company to keep hawking their poor quality bootlegs on their site?  These are not legitimate releases, and the picture and audio quality of the crap they offer are indicative of that fact.  But wait, I think I know the answer to that question--they probably sell A LOT of this crap, so the cut from the sales is nothing to sneeze at....hit that cash register...KA-CHING!!",1527033600,,430,4.797297297297297
8558875,1,B00AXGX47M,DVD did not want to run properly. Kept on stopping and the end of the movie was very disappointing as though it was removed from the movie all together. Also the language was French with English subtitles,1497830400,,204,4.54054054054054

8558877,5,B00AXGX47M,"A family -husband, wife, son, daughter- moves into an old, ""fixer-upper"" mansion in the middle of nowhere. Strange things begin to happen almost immediately, in the form of mysterious ""accidents"". One night, after Sophie (the teen daughter, played by Yasmine Dahm) walks in on her parents having sex, she storms off, and the bedroom windows shatter for no apparent reason. The next morning, dad's artwork is found in ruin. That afternoon, furniture begins flying around, more glass breaks, and the mystery deepens. What's going on? Is the house haunted? The daughter possessed? Both? Events only get more incredible as time goes on, including Killer kitchen appliances! Before long, a TV station is interested in filming in the house. The crew sets up, and the show commences. Of course, they don't believe that anything supernatural is really going on. They quickly discover how wrong they are! EXPULSION OF THE DEVIL is a fantastic French horror film from 1973. Makers of today's so-called ""Found Footage"" movies could learn much from this early example. Highly recommended...",1402272000,12,1078,5.236994219653179
