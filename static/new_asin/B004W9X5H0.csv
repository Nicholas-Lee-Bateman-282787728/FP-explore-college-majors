4485968,5,B004W9X5H0,"I had been waiting anxiously for this DVD to come out.  We had been watching his videos on youtube for some time.  My 3 year old absolutely LOVES 'The Elephant Song', but all his songs and videos are great.  I ordered it on Amazon the day it came out as I was on vacation and no local Barnes and Nobles had any in stock, that way I knew it would be waiting for us when we got home.  She watches it almost daily, and goes to sleep to The Elephant Song every night on her music player.  Best kids entertainer around!!!! Highly recommend.",1314748800,,535,4.155339805825243

4485970,5,B004W9X5H0,"Eric Herman continues to be one of our family's favorite performers.  This DVD is great, putting many of his videos in one place.  No more jumping on YouTube to watch these clever songs.  As Eric's other works, this video is fun for everyone to watch...mom, dad and kids.  Thanks for more great family entertainment!",1311552000,,316,4.796296296296297

8444801,5,B004W9X5H0,My granddaughter loves Eric Herman. This was a great purchase for her.,1405296000,,70,4.916666666666667
8444802,5,B004W9X5H0,"A variety of animation styles, some are spectacular and some are merely ok. The songs are great fun and range from a quiet lullaby to fast-paced stuff. Clearly and thoughtfully aimed at children, but there's gentle jokes in it that adults will appreciate. Other than one part where the volume inexplicably drops for a few seconds, sound production is high quality.",1384387200,,364,4.983606557377049
8444803,5,B004W9X5H0,My 3 year old grandson and I discovered Eric Herman by accident on You Tube and we both fell in love with his music and videos! So creative and he speaks directly to children's minds-- you'll find yourself laughing and singing along. I plan to purchase more of his work.,1367107200,,270,4.42
8444804,5,B004W9X5H0,"I bought this DVD for my nieces and nephews, aged 2-5. They all love it! My sisters told me they knew all the songs within a week and sing along with them all the time. They even said they don't mind watching with the kids since the DVD's aren't really over the top like so many popular kid's movies tend to be.",1357689600,,311,4.032258064516129
8444805,5,B004W9X5H0,I ordered this last year for my 8 month old grandson.  He still watches it almost daily.  The tunes and videos are fun and catchy.  Love it.,1355961600,,140,4.111111111111111
8444806,5,B004W9X5H0,"Our little guy loves singing along and dancing to this DVD.  Many of the songs are fun for adults as well, and we especially like the Elephant Song. Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones.",1325635200,,200,4.555555555555555
8444807,5,B004W9X5H0,"My 16 mths old twins love The Elephant DVD! On rare occasions when we let them watch something, they will watch it dispassionately but! when The Elephant Song comes on, they will smile involuntarily! I love to watch them smile like that :) In any case, no one seems to make non-ugly videos like theirs anymore. Most characters used by some kids' videos nowadays either look ugly, evil or hideous! :(",1318377600,2,399,4.633802816901408
8444808,5,B004W9X5H0,"My petite Celine wants to watch it all day long! She particularly loves ""Ants in your Pants""! Great stuff! Thank you, Eric Herman!",1318204800,,130,4.695652173913044
8444809,5,B004W9X5H0,"We have always liked Eric Herman's music, but the DVD took everything to a new level.  The DVD has all sorts of subtle, but clean, humor that is just not possible to capture in the songs.  The movies are entertaining and my kids regularly ask to watch the Elephant DVD.  I would recommend this to anyone who has children, or who wants to feel young.",1315526400,,349,4.338461538461538
