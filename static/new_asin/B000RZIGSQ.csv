2877141,4,B000RZIGSQ,That is on releasing the series in a decent manner. WE are finally get the second volume of the first season and Paramount should have just released the First Season in one season set... instead this is costing fans a lot of money to collect. In a way I don't mind as long as all the seasons get released. I don't want them to delay and cancel future releases because they say there are poor sales because that would be the studios fault for a higher price tag for a half a season. It is a really good series and I'm speaking from a younger generation. Only 29 here.,1190592000,15,566,4.201834862385321
2877142,5,B000RZIGSQ,"Can't wait until tuesday for the second half of Season one of Streets of San francisco, growing up during the 80's here in the San Francisco Bay Area i recall that the old KOFY TV 20 would show reruns during the day along with other great shows but streets was something always something to look forward to. Their was another tv show that was a predate to Streets of San Francisco it ran from 1954-1960 it was San Francisco Beat/The Line-up. With alot of old tv shows coming to dvd hopefully San Francisco Beat will be next up for dvd with Highway Patrol with Broadrick Crawford.",1190505600,8,579,4.471698113207547
2877143,4,B000RZIGSQ,"The Streets of San Francisco is part of the legacy of Quinn Martin, who was one of television's alltime most successful producers, responsible for some of television's most popular action/adventure series. Martin was the producer for such popular series as The Untouchables, The FBI, Cannon, and Barnaby Jones.

The Streets of San Francisco followed the pattern of most of Martin's shows. There were divided into three acts and an epilogue, and the guest stars were introduced at the beginning of each episode. The show feature veteran, Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden (who during this time starred in a series of popular commercials for American Express credit cards) and Michael Douglas, son of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas.

Malden played veteran SF homicide cop Mike Stone, who was newly paired with rookie detective Steven Keller, played by Douglas. Following the Naked City model of police dramas, Stone showed the green Keller the ropes of policing the city while Keller used his criminology decree and understanding of modern technology to balance the equation. Darleen Carr has an occasional role as Stone daughter and Keller's eventual love interest.

This was a solid, enjoyable series and the teaming of Malden and Douglas was an excellent one. This show is one that is still entertaining almost forty years later.",1187913600,3,1327,5.25
2877144,5,B000RZIGSQ,"Although I always swore that I wouldn't buy the second of any seasons that the powers that be split in two, I'm making an exception here.  Volume I was fantastic and left me hungry for more.  The locations are fantastic, the relationship between the leads and the chemistry between the actors is great, and though some of the episodes plod a bit--most of them are pretty tense and thrilling.  The look of the series is just gorgeous, most of the directing is top notch, and it's fun to watch.

Here's an episode list:
Death Watch (Fishermen as witnesses to a crime--San Francisco!)
Act of Duty (Policewoman as bait in rape case)
The Set-Up (common 70's plot--hitmen)
A Collection of Eagles (a coin collecting episode!)
A Room with a View (witnesses and hitmen)
Deadline (involves a newspaper--duh!)
Trail of the Serpent (Stone is held hostage)
The House on Hyde Street (a boy disappears after school)
Beyond Vengeance (an ex-con is after Stone)
The Albatross (grieving father as vigilante)
Shattered Image (politics, of course--love these titles!)
The Unicorn (a common 70's plot:  priest shielding a criminal)
Legion of the Lost (killer of homeless men--another great title)

Some guest stars:  Brenda Vaccaro, James B. Sikking, Stuart Whitman, Jack Albertson, John Saxon, Belinda Montgomery, Jamie Farr, Richard Anderson, Shirley Knight, Brad Davis, Lew Ayres, Joyce Van Patten, Joe Don Baker, Dick Sargent, Leslie Nielsen, and Dean Stockwell.

I'm looking forward to the coin episode--there's a great coin episode in the Kojak set, too--""Deliver Us Some Evil.""  That was one of the best eps of season one of Kojak.",1185148800,37,1617,5.09469696969697

2877180,3,B000RZIGSQ,I grew up with this series and while it's cool to see the old sights (san francisco) the show is flat compared to Law and Order which is free on netflix.,1367539200,,153,3.967741935483871
2877181,5,B000RZIGSQ,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" was only a minor hit for ABC in the mid-Seventies, but I found it as enjoyable as any other police drama of the era that I have seen.  The series featured two Oscar-winning actors in Karl Malden and Michael Douglas--Malden played Mike Stone, an experienced detective, lieutenant on the San Francisco police force, and mentor to Douglas's character Steve Keller, Stone's young, college-educated partner.  The two teamed up to solve murders, rapes, and drug traffic in the City by the Bay.  This DVD set contains the first season's final 13 episodes that were originally broadcast in the first four months of 1973.

""Streets"" was filmed in and around San Francisco, and the incorporation of the city scenes and scenery of the Bay Area into the show greatly adds to the series.  As well as the scenery and the Seventies clothes and cars, the series enhances the setting further by capturing what everyday bars, restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores looked like at the time--in addition to the superb writing for the episodes, the whole setting of the series is just great.  Victor French, Dick Sargent, and Leslie Nielsen are recognizable guest starts who appeared in these episodes.

If you enjoy crime drama but are a tad too young to remember this series when it was running in prime time, you likely wouldn't regret giving ""The Streets of San Francisco"" a viewing.",1362182400,,1398,4.923404255319149
2877182,5,B000RZIGSQ,"Michael Douglas is probably my favorite actor.  He's a baby in this.  By today's standards, the stories are tame - but that's okay.  Season One was made in 1972.  Seeing the cars, the no cellphones or computers and the young guest stars is a trip down memory lane.  Really, I don't see a reason though why the entire season isn't just put in one boxed set.  Oh except maybe to generate some more sales dollars.  One season - 2 dvd sets.  So far have just purchased Season One.",1359158400,,476,4.329545454545454
2877183,5,B000RZIGSQ,"I really hate that Paramount split the seasons of THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO into two volumes! I wanted to knock off one-star because of that, I might have done that with the first volume, but watching this show and I am really amazed at not only the great acting and story lines, but the incredible on location shooting throughout San Francisco. If you're like me and enjoy watching cosmopolitan cities (as they were in the 50s/60s/70s) like SF used as the backdrop to the unfolding drama/mystery set forth by the various episodes then the cinematography on STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO SEASON ONE. VOL. 2 is well worth buying. I can't imagine the logistics that went into shooting each episode! As far as my eye can tell, there are no recycled shots and you get to ride along inside the car with Stone (Malden) & Keller (Douglas)-- no composite or green screen shots here, not to mention the aerial shots tracking the action on the streets.

The chemistry between its two stars Karl Malden and Michael Douglas is perfect and what really makes this series enjoyable to watch, besides the great location shots, is the wonderful scripts and character development -- especially with the criminals.

Many of the people committing the crimes aren't just one-dimensional hoods, though some are, but many are either suckered into it by another party or they are doing it for other reasons (other than just petty crime or trying to get high), which make each episode well-rounded and keeps viewers guessing at the who, what, and why of each crime.

For these reasons I give this set a solid five stars.

Picture quality is good, as well as sound, and aside from the clothes, hairstyles, payphones, and CB radio in the car, the series doesn't seem dated at all. Unfortunately, there isn't any extras on the SOSF Season 1. Vol 2 DVD set.",1356912000,,1826,4.732704402515723

2877185,5,B000RZIGSQ,"I grew up as a teen-ager watching this cop show and always loved it. So I was absolutely thrilled when I saw they were releasing the seasons on DVD (not some cheap bootlegs). Karl Malden & Michael Douglas are excellent together and as the seasons expand their relationship and characters develop into one the viewers come to love and identify with.

The crimes and detective work that goes into their solving them is always engrossing and the numerous and varied special ""guest stars"" that appear always add some spice to the drama and acting. Cop shows were a dime a dozen during this era but this was my favorite. And one of the reasons is that it was filmed on location. The beautiful backdrop of San Francisco add to the beautiful and realism of the show. So many modern cop/detective shows are set in New York but shot in L.A. or even Canada.

I have vacationed in San Francisco & always appreciated it's beauty and charm. Yes, it's a wild town but that doesn't detract from the wonderful Fishermen's Wharf or downtown area (those beautiful hilly streets and cable cars).

The theme music has always stuck with me (and anyone who grew up during that era) and the intro and the announcer's dramatic tone (""a Quinn Martin Production"") still gives me goosbumps.

Since I can't find the show on any satellite or local stations I bought this (and other discs) to view at my convenience. For those who love classic cop shows this is one of the best. Being set in the 70's doesn't hurt it's value one bit. In fact, it helps bring back wonderful memories of that time growing up.

Buy it and you won't be dissapointed!",1351209600,,1615,4.57439446366782
2877186,5,B000RZIGSQ,"Forty years on, The Streets of San Francisco still makes for quality viewing.
A very young Michael Douglas stars in the show and there are plenty of quaility guest stars in this concluding volume to season 1.

2877187,5,B000RZIGSQ,"I haven't seen The Streets of San Francisco in over 20 years, it was one of the best tv dramas to air in the 1970's.

Big ups to Karl Malden may God rest his soul and Michael Douglas they made the series come alive.",1348272000,,308,4.203389830508475
2877188,5,B000RZIGSQ,"Streets of San Francisco has always been a favorite show of mine.  It is a pleasure to be able to watch it again.  Karl Malden was such a great actor and the relationship between his character and the character played by Michael Douglas makes the show work really well.  Also, I enjoy many of the guest stars.  I rememer San Francisco as it was during the time the series was filmed and I miss it.

2877190,5,B000RZIGSQ,"This series is one of the greatest tv crime shows of all time.
It just looks fantastic and was filmed on location in san fransisco, this is something that other tv shows should do more often.  Los angelos just doesn't look like san fran at all.  The stories and guest stars throughout the series run were always first class and the series looks great on this dvd set There are no lines or blemishes on the prints.  The splitting of the series into two boxsets is bogus but at least we finally get this one on dvd.  Karl Malden and Michael Douglas really shine in this show and even season 5 which featured another actor as the Maldens partner was great.  This is where the series began and it is a great show from the start , the series improved each season and made Michael Douglas a major star.  The music also adds to the shows greatness unlike todays terrible machine made hip hop music this is original stuff made by real artists.

2877192,5,B000RZIGSQ,"The Streets of San Francisco is a class on its own. Superb acting, believable stories, most beautiful location, and of course that seventies feeling, makes it impossible to beat. I am just beginning to enjoy the Volume 2 of the first season and I can tell you the picture quality is absolutely terrific. It is quite unbelievable for a series filmed over 35 years ago. For sure they used top of the line quality equipment back then.
This is an all over fantastic purchase. Go ahead and get it!",1225584000,2,492,4.53932584269663
2877193,5,B000RZIGSQ,"For me, this is one of the best cop shows of the 70s. What a thrill that it was finally released. Brilliantly cast with good storylines and pacing that works, Streets Of San Francisco had all the elements needed for a show to work. Karl Malden is fantastic and Michael Douglas is perfect in his role - never over-playing, always natural and believable.
A little annoyed by the splitting of Season 1 into two parts - greed must be the only reason why this was done (a pattern which is becoming all too prevalent - to the execs: Come on guys! Do the right thing). But I paid because seeing this finally released was too good to be true. If you want to watch a perfect example of 70s police drama (or police drama overall), then Streets Of San Francisco is for you. Let's hope we see the rest of them released very soon.",1222646400,2,817,4.311688311688312

This series, especially during the first four seasons with Oscar-winner Karl Malden and photogenic Michael Douglas as a team, is not only visably striking but a tough and sardonic 60-minute crime drama.  The chemistry between the two leads has never been topped on network television, and there continues to be affection between Malden and Douglas to this day.  Add a jazzy theme by Patrick Williams and top of the line guest stars (in this set) like Leslie Nielsen, Jim Davis, Steve Forrest, Stuart Whitman, Joe Don Baker, Tony Caruso, Albert Salmi, Barbara Rush, Ed Nelson, John Saxon, Barry Sullivan, and Brenda Vaccaro, and you have one of the classic action shows in TV history!",1192320000,3,896,4.8431372549019605
