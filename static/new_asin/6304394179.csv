862561,2,6304394179,"I just happend to see this one again recently, and instead of just attacking everything, I decided to go back and tell you exactly what I thought was wrong.  First of all, I'm not a reader of Stein material, but I've been told that this is not a fair assesment of his work (and I hope not).  Aside from bad acting and makeup (this was made for television, so that's expected.  When I look at a made for young people program, I expect some sort of morality tale, which seems oposite of this story line.  Complaints:
1: The main charactor is a whiner
2: If the Dad is doing a field study of undgulates, why are they doing it in a swamp, and not a forrest?
3: The buddy seems to be the most likeable charactor.
4: If the werewolf is a kid, then how does it transform into an adult werewolf, and if it suposedly killed it's parents, how did the kid survive out in the middle of nowhere for so long?
5: The werewolf, in human form, seems to do everything he can to warn the kid (main charactor) away, but the main charactor seems to be so dumb and whiny, you almost want the main charactor to be eaten.
6: The crazy old man seems to be a throw-in...if you knew him from th opening, he would have made a more sympethetic charactor, and a real vehicle for the build up.
7: ending...as I stated before, the werewolf does everything up until the end...even warning him away in half werewolf form, and seemingly hesitating to bite or scratch...then when the dog comes to the rescue, and the werewolf falls over the ledge and into the bog, all our ""brave"" main charactor does is hide behind a rock and watch his friend (even though a werewolf) struglle until he is sucked under the surface of the bog.  With friends like that, who needs enemies.
8:Even though the dog (did I mention the dog seems to be the best actor in the whole show?)did all the work, our ""hero"" suddenly thinks he's a big-bad werewolf slayer.

To sum it up...everything is rather backwards.  If the ""hero"" was more likable, the plot better written, the charactors better developed (in that frame of thought, how about developed at all), this could have been a really fun kid's tale.  If you want a better version of this story, try reading the novel ""Thor"" (probably  from where this story was originally ""lifted""), or try the movie, ""Bad Moon"" (Parents; ff through the first ten minuits of ""Bad Moon"" and the rest, though scary, should be acceptable for kids 10-older).  It has a better story (though increadbly simmilar), better acting, better charactors and story developement, one of the better werewolf makup jobs done up until ""VanHelsing"", and overall, a more moralistic tale of a boy and his dog versus a reluctant Werewolf.  You'll actually root for the main charactors in that movie.",986860800,4,2753,4.508032128514056

862776,4,6304394179,"this is a pretty good ep. the acting is good, the plot is ok and it is pretty creepy for the most part. its a bit darker than most gb eps but once again low budget tv show. its a full tv hour ep, the first half is petty boring. its just lots of into talking and misdirection, the real fun happens towards the end. however the reason i gave this 4 out of 5 eps is cuz the ending is very confusing. it just makes no sense, im not talking about ur classic rl stine twist. im just talking about clueless. like is the kid dreaming the whole time about werewolves? who was the 2nd werewolf caught? did the one werewolf guy die in the swamp and if the kid was really dreaming, is he really the werewolf? so the ending leaves u confused with no real closure. but still worth buying",1415318400,,773,4.0588235294117645

862783,4,6304394179,"I have loved Goosebumps ever since I was a kid. My dad and I would always rent them on VHS at Blockbuster. The Werewolf of Fever Swamp was probably the episode I watched the most! Sadly, the DVD is very disappointing. There are no special features, no menus, no subtitles or even captions, and no Goosebumps theme song in the beginning. It just starts with R.L. Stine's introduction! How can 20th Century Fox let this happen? I would have been happier with a VHS copy because at least then I could have gotten the theme song in the beginning. Even the picture quality is kinda eh. I would give the episode 5 stars, but the DVD only 3. It was worth the 3 bucks I paid though, so if you love the show like I do, you should still buy some of these because they're cheap.",1380931200,,767,4.260273972602739

862785,5,6304394179,"As an author who likes to look for little gems that delve into the creepy, I found Cry of the Cat to be a good Goosebumps film which packs in a few scares along the way.

In the film, Allison, a rising actress, is in the middle of filming a B-Horror movie called Cry of the Cat. At one point, she becomes annoyed after a mechanical malfunction occurs on the set. As a result, the filming crew is sent off on lunch break while repairs are made. While on her break however, she accidentally runs over a cat with her bike, but is unable to locate its carcass after the collision. She eventually tracks its owners down and discovers that the cat she ran over isn't like other cats. In fact, the one she hit is called Rip, a mutated cat creature which was created at the hands of a mad scientist.  Allison is skeptical at first and blows the story off when she hears it.

Back at the studio, however,  Allison is confronted by Rip several times as she continues to film scenes for the movie. After being scratched by him and freaking out on the set, the director begins to believe that Allison may need to be replaced by a more stable actress. When she tries to explain that it's Rip  causing her to behave erratically, nobody believes her. They think she's an overly ""dramatic"" actress. Worried that she could be fired from the film, Allison tries to carry on despite her fears over Rip.

Eventually  she's let go from the film.  But she and her co-star come up with a plan to stop the cat by going back to the place where Rip was created. Twists and turns occur while they encounter Rip yet again until the film comes to a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say that this was a pretty good story for a Goosebumps tale. Let me explain why. For one, it actually creates a creepy atmosphere throughout the film which helps set the mood. True, the story centers around a film crew filming a horror movie, but that only helps to accentuate the horror Allison is going through as she's terrorized by Rip.

The other element I found interesting was the primadonna attitude the film crew had with one another while they were on the set. Everyone seems to think they are the best thing around since the invention of the wheel. It's played out numerous times as they banter back and forth about calling their agents or ripping on how they hate working on the film. It's actually quite humorous, but it also reinforces the belief that most people have when they think of folks who work in Hollywood. That alone makes the film a little more interesting from a social aspect.

Allison's struggle of dealing with Rip while worrying about being fired works well too. It creates a whole new crisis for her which gnaws on her both physically and emotionally. At that point, you actually start to feel sorry for her character.

As for the acting and special effects, well this is a Goosebumps production from the 90s. However, I felt the acting was decent considering the target audience which was 8-12 year olds. The special effects were wanting, but again, we're talking about the 90s and the audience isn't supposed to be teens watching a slasher film. So the special effects are appropriate if you consider that aspect.

Overall I'm giving this film 5 stars. I think it pushed the limits for tween horror at the time but still managed to bring an interesting story to life. The characters worked well too for the most part. I almost wish they had made a Cry of the Cat 2. It would have been interesting to see Allison in another encounter with Rip. But this film is one of the better Goosebumps films overall in my opinion and is worth a watch if you liked Goosebumps back in the day, or if you like light horror stories in general. Worth a watch or possible purchase.",1374364800,,3770,4.446376811594203

862843,5,6304394179,"The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.

Cry of the Cat is a freaky story about a child actress who is stalked by a mysterious black cat, Rip, who is killed over and over again. The cat keeps coming back, leading the girl to a very strange house.

Basically In the movie this snot nose girl named allison is an actress filming a horror movie.

She winds up running over a cat with her BICYCLE? yea bicycle. She then goes crazy, she starts getting cat characteristics.

 THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE: The deformed cat scientist. Shes half cat half human, her face is so scary and she wants to feed allison to the evil cat. Anyway just get this movie if your looking for a great laugh!",1131321600,11,696,4.338461538461538
