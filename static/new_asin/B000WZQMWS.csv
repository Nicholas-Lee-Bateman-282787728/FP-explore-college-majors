8277437,4,B000WZQMWS,"When watching kid shows, you have to suspend your disbelief and remember yourself as a kid, watching the show. When watching ""The Girl From Tomorrow Series 1"" I felt exactly like that. I hated the bad guy Silverthorn I was actually nervous during the more ""suspenseful"" parts and I actually said ""Yeah!"" when they finally got the bad guy.

When I was a kid, I loved this show. I loved its take on the time travel concept and I'll admit it: I had a crush on Alana (Katherine Cullen).  ( :

Watching it now, it still makes my mind wander off and think about how it would be if we could travel through time far off into the future or past. However, be ready for cheesy special effect made with a low budget. After all, it's a sci-fi kid show so don't expect their special effect budget to be through the roof. I for one, don't care much. In fact, it's part of the appeal. And kids certainly won't care. ^_^  Oh and make sure you have a DVD player that accepts PAL format discs since this is an Australian show.

The villain Silverthorn comes from a time period where the Earth is ravaged by war and technology. Alana comes from a time period where they try to rebuild Earth. So you have a very clever and evil villain that takes advantage of his position in 1990 and a naive girl who is completely out of her element and just trying to get back home. Jenny Kelly is your typical 1990 teenage girl and Petey is her nerdy younger brother. Watching it again with an adult perspective, I really like Petey. He had a great personality and the actor who plays his role is great. Alana is just as cute, although some people might find her a bit too naive.

But ultimately it all comes down to kids fighting the bad guy. So expect a little bit more of that Home Alone way of getting rid of bad guys. Petey is a master at laying traps to catch whoever might trigger them.
So the concept discussed in this series could be developped a lot more but still, being a kid show, it takes a backseat to the humor, wacky plans to infiltrate the bad guy's hideout and the fact that, well, they are just kids. Which is fine for a kid show but for the adult me, who would like the time travel concept developed more, I'm still hungry for more. Don't get me wrong though. They sometimes get pretty serious with the way the villain takes advantage of the fact that he comes from the future and Alana who uses her transducer to fight him. Well, now, I'll have to watch the second series, which does further develop the idea.

The thing though with series 1 is that 95% of the whole season is spent in the year 1990. We don't see much of the year 3000 and we don't see anything from the year 2500. It's all in series 2.

So, if you get this series, I highly recommend getting the second one as well.
Overall, great series for kids, Great series for adults who are able to be kids again! ^_^",1256515200,5,2862,4.248161764705882
