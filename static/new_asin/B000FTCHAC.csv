8126399,3,B000FTCHAC,This is an all-right set. Be warned it shows shapes ect. but does not tell the baby what they are (that's your job). I much preferred Little Steps: ABC's and Little Steps: Numbers & Shapes individual DVDs that my son had (and played out). In fact I just ordered another copy of the ABC's for my 17 month old. Unlike this dvd collection. the others actually tell the kids what each letter/ shape ect are so I can go do house cleaning and know she is getting the most out of video. Thanks to Little Steps: ABC's my son knew all his letters (could recognize and say them) before he was 2 years old. Decide which you have time to do before you buy this set.,1308700800,,653,4.190476190476191
8126400,5,B000FTCHAC,"My family and I really like this set.  I have two two-year-olds who especially love the colors DVD.  All of these DVD's are very primitive.  There are no gimmicks or stupid story lines, just basic animations that capture the kids attention.  They are meant for the parents to interact with the children while they watch so there is only the minimum of narration with classical music in the background.  The shapes DVD actually has no narration at all.  My boys learned their shapes from this show while we talked them through it.  Each shape - triangle, circle and square (which also morphs into rectangles) is its own chapter. The shapes then change color and setting to make different items on the screen.  The ABC DVD has several different ways to view, but our favorite is alphabet rhymes.  The boys know most of their letters from this video.  There is time for us to talk about each of the letters as we see them on the screen as opposed to other videos where you have to talk over the characters.  Also, you do not have to start at the begining and can choose for it to loop at the end.  This is very nice because with the kids shorter attention span, we can focus on the end of the DVD first which sometimes they don't have as much attention for by the time they get to it and then it loops back to the begining where they see the rest that they know much better.  Finally, the colors DVD is nice because each color is in its own chapter.  The animations are mostly all in the color presented, just different shades.  This format is less confusing for the boys.

I would like to re-emphasize that these DVD's are only good with parental interaction. When I put them on, I sit down with my twins (2 yrs old) and we talk about what we see. They are primitive animations that, in my opinion, are good for teaching because of the lack distractions. If you are looking for videos with cutesy characters that are going to entertain while you clean the kitchen or make dinner, etc. - these will not fulfill that wish. Choose something else. If you are looking for a platform to stimulate learning and parental involvement, then you might like this.",1174521600,3,2149,4.457800511508951
