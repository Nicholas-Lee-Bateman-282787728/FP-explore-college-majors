6263506,2,B00IG3LIQ8,"Watch if you are really bored and do not care about quality of acting or filming. It is a mash up of martial arts vs renaissance festival clich with a bit of british humor. The only good parts of the movie is that the main star does all her own stunts, maybe this is a promotional project that went too far into a fantasy realm. The acting is not that bad, but just not worth a 3rd star, plot is a mess.

This could have been a main feature on USA Up All Night if it was actually shot on film and not done with digital and post in final cut pro. Have fun trying to watch through and just enjoy the stunts and martial arts.",1471392000,,622,3.9365079365079363
6263507,3,B00IG3LIQ8,"""Warrioress"" misses out on a higher rating due to production shortcomings and an overdose of goofiness, but I can't help enjoying this film. If it's your purpose as a filmmaker to create a pseudo-medieval action flick with an air of cheesiness on a micro budget, this film ought to be your model. What it does right, it does better than many flicks with ten times its budget.

The story: In a post-apocalyptic future, a mighty warrior (Cecily Fay,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Crusaders/dp/B0055A5VAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Crusaders</a>) embarks on a quest to fight a prophetic duel.

If nothing else, I am glad that the movie exists because it provides such an ample platform for lead star Cecily Fay, who is definitely among the top ten unsung film fighters of this decade. As an actress, she's passable, but as an onscreen combatant, she positively stands out from her cinematic peers and forbearers. As the lead of most of the 19 fights, she and her unique fighting style stand out in both hand-to-hand brawls and swordfights - displaying impeccable coordination and flexibility. At worst, these matches are passable for their sheer physicality, but at their best, they shine for their long takes and ambitious choreography. Kudos also goes to costars Joelle Simpson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doghouse/dp/B003Y7F1JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doghouse</a>) and Helen Bailey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-I-Am/dp/B004H0M2UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big I Am</a>) for their own mighty contributions to these brawls.

I'm pleased that this film has so much fighting to its credit, as it distracts us from its shortcomings. Despite being shot well enough, the flick has that cheap B-movie quality to it, with occasionally interesting locations that are nevertheless clearly public property. Everyone looks a little too clean for this setting, particularly Cecily in her impractical,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frank-Frazetta/dp/1599290189/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frank Frazetta</a>-inspired costume. Dramatic performances are on the good side of hammy. The film features several odd artistic decisions - including the frequent breathy voiceovers - and is clearly set up to accommodate a potential sequel, with the effect that the main villain (Will Brenton, ""Playbus"") can remain oddly detached from everything else happening in the story.

Nevertheless, the filmmakers successfully impose their own infectious energy on the movie, making it palatable to martial arts fans and lovers of indie niche. I can't recommend this to nearly everybody, but I have a feeling that the people who do like it will *really* like it.",1435449600,8,2842,6.260869565217392

6263511,4,B00IG3LIQ8,"I found this movie fascinating--centered on tiny (4'8"") but astounding Cecily Fay commanding scene after scene as a warrior fulfilling her people's prophecy.  In fighting she makes up for her size through skill, speed, intelligence, and sheer ferocity.  Giant dude to take out? Just run up his bulky body and kick him senseless!

Fay wrote the story and co-wrote the screenplay, and has put a lot of herself into this character, which is definitely worth following as a yin-style, fearless fighter who starts seeing more of the big picture as she goes along.

6263518,2,B00IG3LIQ8,"I didn't hate this film nearly as badly as some other reviews would've had me believe. I daresay I'm glad I saw it, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than a rental and must warn those who have not seen it that it's not for everyone.
I learned of this film's existence because of my love for martial arts action. I'm not a practitioner myself, sadly, but I love watching martial arts action films with the likes of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Scott Adkins, Michael Jai White, Tony Jaa and so on. Naturally, while skimming for random martial arts fight scenes on Youtube a few years back, I discovered Cecily Fay and her group ""Babes with Blades"", and sure enough, saw trailers for this film. Needless to say, I wanted to check it out.
Being a Youtube junkie, I like fan films, and that's what this film feels like; its production value is so low that it feels less like a low-budget studio-produced film and more like a very ambitious feature-length fan film. That's the first hoop viewers must jump through to sit through the film. After that, they must endure a plot as unoriginal as any that's ever been seen. Then there's the acting which is bad across the board, though it varies from bad because it's trying too hard with terrible dialogue to bad because the actors are clearly not trying at all and just horsing around.
All the film has going for it are the fight scenes (which are appropriately impressive since whatever the actors lack in thespian ability, they compensate with real-life martial arts backgrounds), the fan service (Cecily Fay spends about 75% of her screen time in a short skirt and metal bikini top, plus a few topless scenes), and Fay's voice, which despite lack of adequate training and direction for compelling delivery of her lines, is nonetheless pleasant to listen to.
If you're a Youtube junkie like me or just plain obsessed with martial arts action, you might enjoy this film for one viewing only, if for no other reason, just to admire the passion that this group of non-filmmakers put into a story that's clearly dead on arrival. Otherwise, I wouldn't even recommend one viewing.",1490054400,3,2124,4.666666666666667

I will say this, in defense of the cast, it was the Directors fault. Cecily Fay, typical Amazonian Character,  and unknown cast could have probably done better had they had a Director who knew what they were doing. The plot, although not original by far, could have gone better. It is therefore my conclusion that, with the exceptions of the fighting sequences, the movie Director did a horrible job. My guess was this Director was just interested in showing off Cecily Fay in short skirts, bikini type outfits with the one modest nude seen with Cecily Fay bathing under a waterfall, yeah, definitely beautiful. So watch the movie for Cecily Fay, and the action scenes and try to ignore the rest. I still enjoyed it.",1474848000,2,1124,4.592039800995025

6263611,3,B00IG3LIQ8,"Low budget sword and sorcery. The script is a little pretentious in scope, a bit moralizing and pedantic at times. Overall the setting is ok, but it could use a little bit more world development: No clear idea how these people came to be who they are, though it is obvious they're our descendants. The action sequences are ok, although some are not very credible. You can appreciate that the tiny heroine means business regarding her martial arts mojo. It can be amusing if you overlook these details.",1473465600,,501,4.704545454545454

I love seeing women who are not lanky blondes kicking actual butt. The feminist journey story is kinda cool and despite the awkwardness, the buddy aspect of it is satisfying if simplistic. It left me with more questions and totally got my imagination going. Suitable for the most part for youngish audiences. If you want to increase your action women movie pantheon, I'd definitely include this in your B action feminist movie cannon.",1509580800,,575,4.76
8641914,3,B00IG3LIQ8,"At first you think this story is set in a medieval fantasy world but bit by bit you come to learn it's a post-apocalyptic realm. There are hints through-out the movie that hint at what has happened and the villains black ""F-symbol"" starts to become familiar. A good point of this story is that the heroine and other actors are skilled at martial arts which is played heavily upon(Not a bad thing at times) during fight scenes. A note to consider for younger viewers is that there is brief nudity at the very start and an erotic sensual love-making scene toward the 25min mark. Not a bad movie though the ending is not entirely tidied up leaving one to imagine there's room for a sequel. If you enjoy Xena/Conan-type worlds with a bit of sensuality this might be an okay movie to watch.",1508112000,2,785,4.496503496503497
