1871939,3,B00008YOLV,"This is about a big game hunter who arranges to have a giant boa (or maybe it's the python) flown in so that he and his fellow hunters can have some fun going after it.  But it escapes and gets down into the sewer system.  Some government people just happen to have an equally huge python (or maybe it's the boa), so naturaly they decide to release the second snake to hunt down the first.  Sounds like a fine idea to me.

Fairly average B movie.  I've only seen the edited for TV version, but it looked like the unedited version might have some T&A.  The characters are average, acting was average (for a B movie), the action was pretty slow.  The snakes are so obviously CGI that watching them fight is more like a video game than a movie.  Really no suspense, and when the snakes attack, since they're put in afterwards via computer animation, the actors don't really seem to react to them.  That pretty much kills any excitement.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and it is somewhat funny in parts.  There's a pretty girl in it, which is the only reason I sat through the whole thing.",1093046400,11,1101,4.400990099009901

1872091,1,B00008YOLV,"The real test of a ""beastie"" movie is the ""beastie.""  Neither the ""scarlet queen (???) boa"" nor the python gets that much screen time, and they don't behave in particularly snakelike fashion when they do.  There's no explanation for the size of either creature.  The scientist is tending the boa so as to produce anti-venom, hand feeding her smaller snakes.  But venom doesn't work when ingested; it works when injected; so feeding small venomous snakes to the boa will not cause her to secrete anti-bodies to their various venoms.  One would need to inject tiny amounts of venom, slowly increasing the dosage, in order to get her to do that.  And snakes swallow their prey whole.  They don't leave bits and pieces of partly eaten prey, strewn around.  As for the human inhabitants of this film: it takes more than good looks to make an actor.  The cardboard cut-outs one sees outside novelty stories behave more credibly than the cast.  Except for the nudity, this movie feels like a not particularly good Sci Fi channel offering.",1439596800,,1031,4.806818181818182

1872125,3,B00008YOLV,"The filmmakers took a supposedly `humorous' approach to this film, assuming that if they didn't take it seriously no one else would (?).  The plot involves a millionaire wacko (Adam Kendrick as Broddick) who decides to invite a crackpot team of nitwits to hunt a BIG snake he just happens to have for just such an occasion.  Needless to say, said snake escapes requiring several groups to track and kill it.  Enter the FBI as one such contingent.  They play it smart by turning to an expert to help them pursue this snake.  Fortunately, herpetologist Dr. Emmett (David Hewlett) is available and he teams up with a marine biologist (Jaime Bergman) to use his GIANT snake as a bloodhound of sorts (because apparently everyone in this movie just happens to have a HUGE snake when one is required!?).  It is a weird premise that also demands full nudity because nothing screams horror movie like a woman taking a bath on a plane!!!

I can't say that it looks as though a lot of effort and care when into the making of this movie.  It was obviously made to cash in on a trend.  That it failed to meet anyone's standard for excellence is apparent in the results.  Still, it was entertaining enough that I decided to keep it for future viewings.",1409961600,2,1238,4.5610859728506785

1872128,2,B00008YOLV,"A big game hunt goes dangerously wrong when a monster-python (the green snake) escapes just outside the city of Philadelphia. The CIA sends out its very own monster-boa (the red snake) to eliminate the threat, and the stage is set for an epic battle of brawn versus brawn as the ophidians battle for world supremacy in the Philly metro. Or at least for the right to munch on a big game hunter. And yes, I'm simplifying the plot somewhat...

Otherwise, I noticed the preponderance of nude and semi-nude females in this production, suggesting it's made for 16-year old boys. Other monster flicks actually show more monsters than babes! I presume those are oriented to 12-year old boys. I admit I prefer such movies, suggesting that my mental age on a Friday night might be just about eleven and a half. So I'm afraid I can only give ""Boa Versus Python"" two stars. But then, the Delaware Valley aint what it used to be. Welcome to my barbecue.",1376870400,,940,4.62874251497006
1872129,4,B00008YOLV,"I freely admit I bought this movie knowing how bad it was, and for David Hewlett. I've adored him for years now.

The plot without giving anything away, involves a millionaire with a reputation for finding rare or somehow altered animals (bigger is better!) and creating a semi-controlled hunt for them involving other rich folks with too much money and time on their hands. Our villain Broddick (Adam Kendrick) gets a hold of a giant python intending it for one of his hunts and things naturally don't go as planned.

On the other side we have our heroes, Monica a plucky marine biologist (Jamie Bergman) whose developing sensors for dolphins as the navy uses them in dives, in hopes of mapping both the environment the sensors are in, and all that can be seen in it it's field. Joining her is Dr. Emmett (the always fantasticDavid Hewlett) a reptile and snake expert whose own specific research involves Betty, a giant genetically enhanced scarlet boa whose been bred in hopes of creating a universal anti-venom.

When the python gets loose, as giant big damn snakes tend to do, and Samuel L. Jackson isn't around, the government in the form of Agent Sharp (Kirk B. R. Woller) decides to try and let the giant boa take it on and you have your standard cable movie creature feature plot.

What makes this one different is that it manages to walk the line very carefully between being too silly or tongue in cheek, and taking itself way too seriously. The script is several notches above several of the large beast vs large beast movies of the last decade and the cast is too.

Make no mistakes, a great movie that will be long remembered, this is not. There are naturally a few cringe worthy lines and wooden performances, but for an enjoyable ""bad"" movie with a ridiculous premise, a decent amount of laughs and action, Boa vs Python isn't a bad way to spend a Saturday. And if creature flicks are your thing, I think you'll enjoy it.",1368489600,2,1936,4.616279069767442

The first half of the movie seemed to be going ok, then useless rubbish is thrown it, un-needed, eye rolling little love scenes between the hero and leading lady, and trigger happy morons with guns... and you basically have a movie you end up skipping scenes and turning it off as it draws out into nothingness.

It's hardly a Boa VS Python movie either, sure they end up fighting at the end, but the whole stupid movie focus around the people hunting it and there boring little speeches to each other.

If you really must see 100 foot long, fake as can be, looking snakes strangling people, then go ahead and see it, but I advise you to try and rent or download this before purchasing, as it's most likely to be something you will never want to see ever again.",1240704000,,1070,4.34

So don't be fooled by the picture on the front cover of this movie.  I can tell you right now that the only time you see the giant Reticulicated Python (dark snake on cover) & Scarlet Queen Boa (red snake on cover) ever fight is at the very end of the movie.  The rest of the time all the giant snakes ever really do is mostly slither and eat some people.  Also do not be fooled by the helicopter shooting a missal at the snakes.  That never happens in the movie, in fact when I saw the movie no air craft even got close to the snakes and there were no helicopters in the movie.

But all in all I'd honestly say this movie was worth the $6 I payed for it at the Mansfield Covered Bridge festival. And I don't even really know why I'm saying this.  And all in all it wasn't the worst movie about giant snakes I've ever seen (Anacondas was far worst).

 A giant python escapes from a cargo truck, so this rich buttmunch and a hunting team go after it. See, hunting and killing the snake was always their intention. But the government has other plans, sending a giant boa constrictor after the python to kill it. Of course, the whole situation gets out of hand soon enough.

 The snakes never actually fight until the last 10 minutes, but the showdown is kind of cool, altough breif. If you like crappy monster movies, rent BOA VS PYTHON. You may or may not enjoy yourself.",1154476800,5,702,4.4186046511627906
1872157,1,B00008YOLV,"I've noticed my reviews are, for the most part, either 1 or 5 star reviews. Once again, I have encountered a product that cannot logically be given anything higher than 1 star. I rented Boa vs. Python expecting to witness the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever. What I witnessed was the most juvenile and sophomoric movie ever, and it wasn't even fun to watch in some prehistoric level of my brain. It was painful and damaging, like trudging through infected syringes.

Okay, this is a total B movie. Plot holes are expected. (Like someone half-way opening the cage that's holding a giant snake to tranquilize it with a tiny pistol. Who could have ever expected a snakes' tail to fit through an enormous opening?) Bad special effects are expected. (The snakes seem to glow in dark, subterranean environments. Excellent.) Archetypical characters are expected. (Silent Indian guy with arrows? Check. Rambo guy with a flamethrower? Check. Nondescript female lead? Check.)

... But this movie is a grand new level of DIRKA DIRKA. This is a film that promises two giant snakes fighting in a city, with exploding helicopters; as proudly displayed on the cover. What we have is a movie featuring a girl getting orally pleasured by a giant snake, a snake that later fights another giant snake in some dark tunnel for less than a minute. What the hell is this? It's not funny or the least bit entertaining. Recommended if you want to see how low the bar can go.

1872158,3,B00008YOLV,"First off let me say that I'm a big fan of the big snake movies, but this movie was kind of dissapointing. One reason, the CG was odd, the snakes looked cartoonish with their huge bulgy eyes and their bright color. Another reason was the corny taglines the character Broddick kept saying like, ""We're in Python country."" and, ""How do you like you meat?"" Last, the python looked no different from the boa other than their color. If you, like me, are a fan of snake movies than you might want to give this movie a chance, but if you aren't, then forget that you ever even heard about this movie.",1140134400,,593,4.351351351351352
1872159,3,B00008YOLV,"The thing that struck me as unique about this movie was the roll of Agent Sharpe played by Kirk Woller.  Usually the guy in charge refuses to believe what is happening and by the time he realizes their impending doom, it's too late and the carnage begins.  Within about 5 seconds of hearing that 2 deaths have occurred at a local water treatment plant (and with the aid of a just discovered giant scale as the only clue) Agent Sharpe immediately solves the mystery then spits out a detailed 47 step plan of action from shutting down the plant and limiting access to the area to acquiring the services of a nearby government issue gigantic Boa Constrictor to hunt for the rogue Python. Has this guy been waiting his whole life for this scenario to occur?  You're thinking ""No way! Never in a million years does this happen"".  His plan has more holes than Sonny Corleone's car at a New Jersey ticket booth but to spit that plan out on the fly was quite impressive, totally unbelievable but impressive.  There was some hope for this movie...

I will also praise the explanation behind the giant Boa existing in the lab.  It seems pretty believable in the realm of Sci-Fi B-movies that David Hewlett's character would be trying to create a universal snake anti-venom by feeding small poisonous snakes to his giant Boa Constrictor and using it's blood as anti-venom. Nicely done.

And the special giant snake effects were not totally atrocious. I'd prefer to see the blatant use of a man in a rubber suit in full daylight (see ""Alien 3000"") which always gets me into the mood for a good laugher of a bad movie but the effects were passable.

But of course other than that, the movie falls apart with plot holes and stereotypical character flaws and into the schlock we expect.  The assumption that the Boa can do anything to stop the Python is lame not to mention that there are about 1,000 better ways to catch or kill the snake than to compound the problem by releasing another one.  And how was the lab isolated Boa pregnant in the first place? Hello? Give me something here. Don't tell my Mr. Python is the father in record time. O.K. fine, set up the sequel if you must. Not that this movie really ends in the first place. The opening credit sound track sounds like something more appropriate for an Atari 2600 video game circa 1979. Da da da da, da da da da, digitally replicated over and over again ad nauseam.

Angel Boris does her award winning plot independent nude scene which is not a complaint by any stretch of the imagination.  She's hot and I rented the movie because of her.  I remember her from ""General Hospital"", ""Las Vegas"" and ""Fear Factor"" and she reminds me of the typical actress struggling in Hollywood using her assets to get parts until he big break.  Actually, she does seem to be steadily improving, she probably has the most believable part in the movie and is afforded the luxury of playing it straight, unlike most of the painfully over the top portrayals here. The father and son hunting team is more painful than the sound track!

Final ratings: ***-Angel Boris , ***1/2-Boa (Immaculate conception sub plot), **-Python (At least he kills almost everyone in the movie!): Summary: Just not as much fun as I had hoped. Needed to have had much more gore and some over the top carnage to overlook the plot flaws. Definitely needed more humor for this genre. Maybe more skin as well.

Featuring various combinations of babe lust, wonton carnage, savage (or not so savage) brutality, far out locations, techno-junky-ism, monsters, weapon fetishes, space ships, mutants, armored vehicles and more babe lust, they come in Horror, Monster, Sci-Fi, Girly and many other sub-varieties.  My reviews of such movies take this intentional ""guilty pleasure"" aspect into account and are written for people who enjoy either watching or making fun of this sort of entertainment at least some of the time.  SOME B movies are so well made they really aren't B movies at all, and when I feel I've found one, I'll let you know.

Boa Vs. Python

Featuring David Hewlett (Stargate Atlantis), Jaime Bergman (Playboy) and Angel Boris (Playboy), Boa Vs. Python gets three stars from me as a Monster vs. Monster B movie (Story = 2, Production Values = 3.5, Babe Quality = 4, Exposure = 2 ... and no, my final score of 3 isn't a mathematical average).  For me, this movie had the feel of a computer game where the players are pitted against two giant snakes who also happen to be pitted against each other.  Bergman and Boris are both very easy on the eyes and will appeal to anyone who enjoys watching Playboy Bunnies troop around video game like sets toting weapons and pseudo-scientific gear ... as long as you're not too disappointed by only brief nudity and a lack of overtly sexual content.  As a bunny who's been in several films, Boris's acting is certainly suitable for B movies and won't disappoint folks who are used to the genre.  When it comes to B movies, Boris ""gets it"" and seems to be having fun jiggling around the woods in a lace lined, low cut top, camouflage BDU pants and a gun.  Bergman seemed a little less practiced, but more than makes up for it with very appealing looks and a bust line that bounces nicely when she runs in a snug, low cut top.  (Remember folks, we're talking guilty pleasures and eye candy here, not Academy Award performances.)  David Hewlett has been putting in fan pleasing performances on Stargate Atlantis for a couple of seasons now and definitely added some quality to the overall acting effort of this film in his role as a snake specialist.  His presence in the film definitely makes easier the extra level of ""suspension of disbelief"" required for B movies.  It's a genre he'd probably do well to spend more time in.

All in all, this was an enjoyable film for those of us who can enjoy B movies with a ""not taking it too seriously"" attitude.  It lacked the graphic violence, increased skin exposure, sexual content and top notch effects to get more stars on the B-movie scale, but I definitely enjoyed it.",1128124800,14,2818,4.6971544715447155
1872171,2,B00008YOLV,"My 9 year old son picked this out from the video store and begged me to rent it.  I kept my finger on the ""off"" buttom due to the R rating but I never had to use it.  The movie was way too stupid to be offensive.  I really don't understand why the producer didn't shade the few nude scenes and tone down the four letter words.  He should have aimed for a PG rating because preteen boys seem to be the target audience for something this juvenile.",1112313600,2,445,4.0227272727272725
1872172,5,B00008YOLV,"When the scientist says that the main point of the movie is the 'stupidest idea he's ever heard'. You know you're in for a treat.

A multi-millionaire sets up a hunt for big game hunters. They are after a 80 foot python. However the snake escapes before the hunt can begin. They go after it anyway. The feds however have a brilliant plan. They find a female scientist is Miami (with the biggest nostrils I've ever scene). She dives with dolphins and can track them by implanting stuff in their heads. They take her to a snake scientist who has grwon a 100 foot boa constrictor (you're tax dollars hard at work). It seems he has been trying to make an all purpose anti-venom by feeding the giant boa poisonous snakes (???)

So they implant the tracking device in the boa and send it out to figh the python before it kills anymore innocent civilians. No one bothered to mention that the boa was female (Betty) and the python was male. So when the meet they don't fight but fornicate (ha ha ha!!!)

The boa finally fights the python only after it ate her eggs.

Anyway the big game hunters (back to them) are a motley crew indeed and are all laid to waste by the snakes in one way or another. The red-head in the fatigues is beautiful and has a great bath tub scene. Full nudity is always a plus in films like these. The millionaire is ripped in half while using a flame thrower in a techno bar. Yes you read that right. You'll have to watch the movie to see how that happens.

All in all a fun film if you don't take it too seriously.",1109635200,2,1532,4.268965517241379
1872173,2,B00008YOLV,"I rented this movie because, well, uh...I have no idea why I rented this movie but I'm glad I did because Jaime Bergman is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.  I actually made a ""Oh!"" sound when she came onscreen.  I haven't done that since the Nazi girl in ED GEIN.  Sadly, Jaime did not get naked.  How rude.

Angel Boris, the other female lead, does get naked for about a minute and while she's nowhere near as hot as Jaime I'm still grateful.  Thank you.  Also at the very beginning of the movie there is a very good looking waitress.

Oh yea there's also some snakes.  The CGI reptiles are pretty bad, but first time director David Flores manages to pull it off and make this film kinda fun thanks to a good sense of humor and some interesting characters including a  reporter who blames all of the destruction on Al Queda; a group of gung-ho hunters who kill a rabbit with a hand grenade and a cop who gets excited, slips and falls face first into a pile of guts.  ""I think you have a piece of liver on your face.""

Worth watching as long as you remember not to expect too much from a movie called BOA VS. PYTHON.",1101168000,17,1157,4.232876712328767
1872174,5,B00008YOLV,"This movie rocks.  Period.  It's a touching, feel-good story about the trials and tribulations of a giant, underprivileged boa constrictor growing up in inner city Chicago.  Grab yourself a glass of...  milk...  and drink every time the FBI agent says something catchy, like you just clicked on a marine in starcraft -- ""outstanding"", ""I'm ready to kick some butt, sir"".  And chug that glass of leche every time Broddick rips off his shirt to show he means business.  Also imbide some dairy goodness every time an 80 foot snake sneaks up on someone without them noticing (two drinks if they get bit in half).

Summary:  This movie ROCKS, you will laugh yourself SILLY",1101081600,5,667,4.831858407079646
1872175,3,B00008YOLV,"This is an odd film that cashes in on a number of themes.  We start out with a wrestling match between to masked wrestlers (Python and Boa).  Then we have lots of nudity (a continuing theme).  Then we have the bored hunters looking for a new quarry.  We even have the secretive government agents who know more than they say and are not surprised by anything.  Oh, and there are giant snakes.  While the python is related to the Python movies, this is a different boa (the original was prehistoric).

Rich hunter procures the python to be used as a quarry for typical hunter (even included the obligatory good-ole-boy).  The Python gets away and the hunt moves to a new location, a water and power station.  The Feds move in to seal off the facility and stop the creature.  We then add a farm-raised giant boa that will be cybernetically enhanced to catch the python.  More sex, nudity and gunplay with some romance (reptilian and mammalian) and the film eventually moves to a conclusion as all groups come together.

Much of the movie does not make a whole lot of sense.  First we have the warrior chick who hates snakes.  Why does she have a snake tattooed along her spine?  We have the scientist how has spent years to develop a universal antitoxin.  He says that if his work saves just one life it will all be worth it.  Bu he immediately moves to protect the python even though it keeps killing people.  Why the cybernetics?  A simple camera strapped on the snakes head would have done just as well.  If the sensors are keyed to the cybernetics why do they detect the python and hunters?  Why are the lone-wolf hunters expected to work as a team?  A contest would be more in there personality profiles?  What happened to the FBI?  They just disappeared to let the main group solve all of the problems.

Still, with a good bowl of fresh popcorn and the right time, this can be quite fun to watch.  There is more nudity in this one than is included in any five other similar films.  The scene with the python and the lovers in the station wagon is priceless and thoroughly laugh-inducing.  Its got plenty of action, nudity, guns, snakes, and plot devices but lacks in script, plot, and sense.  Oh, the cover is bogus.  No street scenes or battles with helicopters.",1101081600,5,2266,4.509852216748769
1872176,1,B00008YOLV,"I'd like to think that someone got fired over this movie. The really amazing thing about Boa vs. Python is that it got made at all. Then, after it got made, it aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. Now, we all know that the Sci-Fi Channel is not exactly known for excellence in programming, but this is an all time low.

The fact that someone pitched Boa vs. Python as a concept, and someone else said, ""Yeah! Great!"" is just plain frightening. I almost can't blame the writer, the director, the actors, or the terrible CGFX team.

They did what they had to do. The worst thing about Boa vs. Python is that it came into existence at all. 2 out of 10 stars. One for the python, one for the boa.",1100217600,2,684,4.213740458015267
1872177,4,B00008YOLV,"Hey, for a straight to video release, this one ain't so bad.  The obvious CGI effects are pretty darned good; the snakes looked part of the action most of the time.  In this one, a musclebound big game hunter sneaks a huge python (where he got it, no one bothers to tell us) into the country in order to provide some wealthy businessmen a rare hunting opportunity.  Of course, the snake escapes and heads for the sewer system of Philadelphia (of all places).  FBI Honcho (played glumly if adequately by Kirk B. R. Woller) contacts a pretty biologist (Playboy's Jaime Bergman) who has been working with dolphins to use her ""implants"" on a giant boa being harvested by scholarly and almost hunky David Hewlett.  They use these implants to track the python through the boa's eyes.  Mysteriously enough, the darned machine doesn't work very well (there goes government spending again), so the good guys don't know that the bad guys (the hunters) are also on the prowl for the snake(s).  Adam Kendrick as Broddick, the head nasty, chews up both the scenery and his cigars, and throws his considerable weight around, alas to no avail.

Of all the snake movies, and we've had tons, this one isn't the best, but it's certainly not the worst (see SSSSSS...).  Anyway, fans of this type of movie shouldn't be too disappointed.",1098662400,10,1316,4.7368421052631575
1872178,3,B00008YOLV,"Although they make a small reference to Greg Larson from Python and Python II, they were unable to take it farther because Boa vs. Python is a Columbiua Tri-Star release and Pythons are 20th Century Fox, so the film really has no connection, not even to Boa, which is distributed by Columbia Tri-Star as well.  Since Python II and Boa were released in 2002 they're CG effects are a little outdated.  Ok, alot outdated.  Now it's 2004 and the snakes are a little more clearly generated, but they're not up to par with modern effects.  The story is a little different from the other three entries in the series, but nothing too surprising.  Nudity, blood, violence, and bad language are all prominent in the film, so keep it away from small kids.  It's not the best, and the ending is pretty abrupt.  The movie is technologically better than the other three movies, but it's not a better movie.",1094860800,3,892,4.6075949367088604
1872179,3,B00008YOLV,"In yet another ""versus"" movie, Hollywood chooses a match-up that is not unlike the others that we have seen in the cinema lately.  This time it is between two species of the snake world, boas and pythons.

An enormous python escapes from a truck delivering it to be hunted and captured for money.  After terrorizing the sewers of Philadelphia, the FBI enlists the aid of two fellow scientists to remedy the situation.  One has been harboring an enormous boa for years, while the other one has beautiful ""implants"".  Together they work to bring this slithering beast of evil down.  Little do they know they are not the only ones hot on the trail.  A big game animal hunter named Roddick has recruited some of the best hunters in the world to bring this beast down.  The battle royale begins as the lines between man vs. nature, man vs. machine, and man vs. man are blurred and new boundaries are set.  Who will reign supreme?  Find out this SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!!

Impressive graphics and an excellent balance between action and gore are what keep this film afloat.  This straight to DVD release should have most people laughing, but oddly kept my attention until the very end.  The story is flawed, the characters are unbelievable, and the script is amateurish (see constant remarks about ""implants"" and Monica), but there is something to be said about using good CGI.  This is no LOTR, but for a straight to DVD release I was impressed.  Director David Flores has done an exceptional job of giving us exactly what we came looking for with this film.  We wanted action, some nudity, and tons of snakes, and he successfully handed them to us on a silver platter.  If you do not walk into this film with high expectations, you will probably leave impressed.
