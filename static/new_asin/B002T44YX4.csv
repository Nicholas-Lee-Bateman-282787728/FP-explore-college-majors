8379808,1,B002T44YX4,"This is not what I expected for $29.95. This live ocean coral reef aquarium experience of : Fascination Red Sea,is 60 minutes long and has very very little to offer the viewer in terms of fish and other coral reef wildlife creatures. The first 20 minutes all you will see is the same tall reef with jacks,silver sides, in which they feed on and lion fish. I keep telling myself when are they going to move on to something more interesting.  It seems to me as if these divers just jumped into the sea with there tanks,snorkels and movie cameras and create a video of what they saw which is little,a whale shark, small tiny fishes, lots of empty coral rocks,reefs,that you see over and over with a moray eel a puffer fish, two clown fishes and a couple other fishes and that's about it. Where are the lobsters, crabs,turtles and cuttlefishes? Where are the fish and all those sea creatures that I was hoping to see? This is a DVD-R manufacture on demand product with no narration no sub titles just bubbles as you sight dive along with them. This is not in HD so the visual are poor. My point is, for what it contains at the current price look else where. If you want to see some incredible creatures with an abundance of sea life, lots of beautiful fishes all kinds groupers,snappers,schooling fish, sharks, crabs,the works I recommend: (Visions of the sea) Dive Into Your Imagination with Annie Crawley. She sure will gave you eye candy, a visual treat and more to talk about with excellent commentary or you can turn off the commentary and just enjoy the beauty below with nice music. I truly regret wasting $29.95 on Aquatribe: now the world can see,Fascination Red Sea.",1348185600,,1672,4.573333333333333
