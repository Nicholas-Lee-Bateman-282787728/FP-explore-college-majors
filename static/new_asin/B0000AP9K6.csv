1908507,3,B0000AP9K6,"This is the same story as ' My Best Friend's Wedding"" except the genders are reversed. We have friends since childhood (Uday Chopra & Tulip Joshi). The girl rings the boy to say she is getting married to Jimmy Shergill. He realises he's always loved her and goes to undermine the wedding. He has a best friend (Bipashu Basu) who comes to help his plan and make the girl jealous.
The problem I had with this movie is that the leads (Uday & Tulip) are less charismatic than the support actors (Jimmy and Bapashu). This was also Tulips' first movie and she seemed wooden and self-conscious in her acting. So when the supports came on I lit up and when the leads came on I was less engaged. Uday is fine but this is romance rather than comedy (which many find him best in) and Jimmy is more the romantic hero. Uday and Jimmy reprise their characters from the much loved Mohabbatein  (or do they play themselves in both??)
Mostly I found the music bright enough but unmemorable. As a Yash Raj film it has a professional quality look but it seemed very average for that. The story is fine and I don't mind them making remakes of Hollywood. I would have liked to care more though.
Elsewhere on the Net it gets about average - some a bit above and some a bit below. I won't bother holding onto this one.",1243728000,,1295,4.351239669421488

7997781,4,B0000AP9K6,"So many reviews have said 'Just like My Best Friend's Wedding' but I can list 10 differences that make this story actually very different, even tho yes, it's a best friend's wedding with a few similarities. Just don't need to say 'this is based on that movie' for Hindi movies; since  often it's quite a different twist or storyline and sometimes even the Bollywood movie was made Before the US or English one. Surely this is a theme in wedding stories and this one is enjoyable if you love a Bollywood movie. Second time I've seen it and it was memorable enough to want to watch again. In this period/genre of movies, the acting can be a little over the top at times, tho there are always moments that seem very real and the acting is convincing and true. I see that as sort of as a stage play / musical kind of exaggeration, and still find it enjoyable. The scenery, sets, costumes, culture, songs, innocence, friendship, family is all very endearing (even tho you wonder if such an alternate world as these lifestyles exist being a Westerner who's been to India). After a stressful day, this movie was the perfect medicine. The 'all is fair in love' idea kind of balanced out the manipulation in the beginning and it had a lot of heart to it as the movie progressed, rather than tricky mean-ness.  Enjoyed Uday Chopra, wish he was still acting (he's producing movies these days). Personally, I'm always so happy to find a good movie with enjoyable actors which isn't full of violence that I have to Ffwd through and this was one of them. Four stars from here.",1467849600,,1562,4.535460992907802

7997785,3,B0000AP9K6,"""Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Ha"" (It's My Friend's Marriage) is a romantic comedy about a man who receives a phone from his childhood friend saying she is getting married. The man goes to attend the wedding with the intention of stopping the wedding. The groom recognizes the threat. They both work to win her love. The story is pleasant, but I didn't enjoy some of the slap stick humor.",1349654400,3,379,4.507246376811594
7997786,5,B0000AP9K6,"I wanted to watch Uday Chopra's movies so I ordered this one, but I thought I already knew how it ended based on the songs posted on youtube, but I was wrong. It ended so much better and I absolutely loved it. I think Uday is an amazing actor and this shows him off so wonderfully. It's a really great Bollywood story; very believable, grounded in reality. I mean, this could happen. It has great songs, great dance numbers, wonderful costumes and scenery, and ah - love! I highly recommend it; I've watched my copy serveral times already and I still want to keep watching it!",1323043200,,576,4.443396226415095
