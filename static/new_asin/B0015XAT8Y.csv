3148597,4,B0015XAT8Y,This documentary begins the conversation on reconciliation between Native peoples and their conquerors. We are very far behind Canada and New Zealand... probably far ahead of Guatemala. I brought this DVD to work and showed our medicine man/cultural director. I work with Native peoples in recovery in a culturally focused program. He was very impressed. These are people who just came to each other and approached from the heart; a place of caring and openness. I hope they continue their conversations and community activities. They can lead the way for the rest of us to walk,1310601600,,578,5.03125

I hope it makes it's way around the world and into the schools and TV viewing schedule of every teacher-parent-guardian of the next generations to come. Please buy a copy, buy more for gifting to those you love ... and revere the word ""reconciliation"" as a magical word the alchemist conjured up to bring everyone to their senses.",1269820800,4,360,4.640625

3148600,5,B0015XAT8Y,Excellent documentary.  The history books need rewritten.  We need to listen to the Native Americans and learn the truth.,1239667200,10,121,5.315789473684211
3148601,4,B0015XAT8Y,"This documentary is well worth watching.  These are real individuals and tribal peoples ( I know one of them).  The process of reconciling is balanced with its ""pluses"" and its ""on-going"" work.",1238112000,6,193,5.0
3148602,5,B0015XAT8Y,The more I learn about our history in the U.S. the darker it gets. But this movie is about two cultures trying to heal the wounds which run deep. It's a must see movie.,1226275200,10,168,3.9705882352941178
3148603,5,B0015XAT8Y,"A touching and inspiring documentary that shows how people of two different cultures in one community have come together to heal the wounds of the past. If you've ever been haunted by the depredations made on American Indians in U.S. History and wanted to make a difference for good today, this video provides a model for how that can happen. I highly recommend Two Rivers.",1217203200,16,373,4.753846153846154

8260426,5,B0015XAT8Y,This is the great documentary about how the whites went to learn more about the natives I enjoyed in my collection,1485216000,,114,4.476190476190476
8260427,2,B0015XAT8Y,"This film seems more dated than it actually is (2007).  The film makers have a choppy narrative on harrowing record of Native peoples and Euro-American western expansion.  Maybe they took too much on by focusing on the transformation of a stunningly ill-informed, but admirably curious group of baby-boomer Euro-American residents of Twisp, Washington.  It is really more their film than a edifying account of Native American genocide.  There is a Christian undercurrent through the story that I found annoyingly one-sided, not presenting Christianity for what it is in the Americas:  A tool of colonization.

I did not buy this film, but saw it as part of Boulder's Indigenous People's Day.  Perhaps the lack of direct involvement of Tribe members in the actual film making made it so unsatisfying.  Hard to say.  The people interviewed were edited in to serve a narrative purpose:  To bring a feel-good movie about a superficial reconciliation in a town where the Native American residents had to drive in from the Colville and Spokane reservations to participate.

Save your money and support some Native American film makers instead.  Their stories are more challenging, but i the end, more edifying.  A short list can be found at:

8260428,5,B0015XAT8Y,"This is a wonderfully powerful film.  The USA does not have a history of really engaging in a dialog regarding racial reconciliation, but this film goes right at it.  I have shared the film with students from UVA's Native American Student Union and they are excited by it.  This should be required watching for children in schools as a primer for really addressing racial and economic disparity in this country.  South Africa is way ahead of the USA.  'Two Rivers' is a wonderful start in the right direction.  Buy it.  Watch it. Share it. Talk about it with others.  Don't wait.",1412294400,,579,4.663366336633663

8260431,3,B0015XAT8Y,"The events are worthwhile to view, but the guilt-ridden inspiration is a little too much.  It's not a bad watch, but the producers missed a great opportunity.",1384646400,,158,4.851851851851852
8260432,5,B0015XAT8Y,"I loved this video, because it showed people with an open mind. It affirmed exploring relationships. We all want peace and happiness.  Truth and reconciliation, being sensitive to, listening to, and standing for justice with Native Americans is a path to peace and happiness.",1378684800,,275,5.25
8260433,4,B0015XAT8Y,I have been very interested in the way treaties with the Native American people had been broken by the white race over time and the plight of Native American people. This DVD gave me a bit of hope in people of various backgrounds coming together to attempt to right the wrongs of the past. I'm glad I purchased this DVD.,1377561600,,320,4.35
8260434,5,B0015XAT8Y,"Two rivers is a powerful true story about finding our way to real reconciliation between descendents of European settlers & native Americans. It brings home the powerful reality that we are all equal in Gods eyes. Reconcilliation can only happen where personal relationships are sought out, built &  nurtured within a context of respect ... The movie is great - the reconcilliation brought about by this work is beautiful and so very important.",1373846400,,444,5.082191780821918
8260435,5,B0015XAT8Y,"I am a member of the Yankton Sioux tribe of South Dakota.  After watching this I had tears in my eyes and my heart was full.  I am a child of the '60's and realize I cannot change the whole world at once.  This DVD shows how one can be involved in a great change in a small way within your own environment.  It shows how one group began a conversation--a start at this enormous and very SILENT issue and made a huge change that hopefully will produce a domino effect.

I will be speaking at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in a few days about the Hiawatha Indian Insane Asylum and the atrocities committed there.  At the end of my presentation, I will show this film.  We shall see what kind of reaction we will get.

IN ORDER TO HEAL--WE MUST REMEMBER",1362614400,3,756,4.2377622377622375
