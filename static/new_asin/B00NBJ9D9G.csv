6637785,5,B00NBJ9D9G,"I feel like if you haven't watched his hand technique DVD, you may not understand conceptually where he is coming from the entire video. Regardless, it was some of the best money I've spent in a while. Very historical, and informative video with a lot of material to digest. It'll definitely take more than one sitting to just absorb the information in this dvd. My only complaint is the audio for me isn't perfectly synced with the video (it's still very watchable, because it's *slight*) but it can be a nuisance at times.

I wouldn't suggest this video for beginning drummers without a teacher to guide them through the basics, but I feel like in the years to come this will become a standard for any drummer that's working or going through university.",1416355200,6,755,4.676691729323308

6637787,5,B00NBJ9D9G,"This drumming DVD is a well-produced and valuable resource for drummers.  The focus is on how to play, not what to play.  That is, this DVD is focused on foot technique.  The first disc is an exceptionally thorough explanation of bass drum foot technique--all the way from heel-down single strokes to hybrid techniques that enable one to perform multiple strokes efficiently.  The second disc covers the history and mechanics of the bass drum pedal, and reviews a few odds and ends:  like the advantages of less friction between your foot and the pedal.  The third disc covers the hihat pedal, as well as an excellent series of exercises for developing your footwork.  Many times throughout the first disc, I had ""aha"" moments where I was presented with a more efficient way to play the bass drum patterns that I struggle to execute.  The exercises on the third disc systematically work through different combinations or foot patterns; I'm confident that regular practice of these exercises will dramatically increase both my ability to play more complicated patterns and my ""groove"" on simpler patterns.  Despite the DVD being a technique-focused DVD, Jojo keeps the focus on enabling one to play with musical artistry.  He reminds us that technique is a means to a musical ends.  Accordingly, he does a good job of avoiding a condescending attitude of, ""this is the RIGHT way to play"".  Instead he presents tools that one can use to be able to play without hindrance.  Overall, I think this is an invaluable resource for drummers who want to develop or refine their footwork.",1415577600,30,1577,4.928030303030303

6637804,5,B00NBJ9D9G,"So far so good - I am only in the beginning stages of this video and the concepts presented will take time to learn and work into my playing.

For a drum video, the instruction is very good.  JoJo is entertaining to listen to and one of his best attributes is his ability to use analogies to communicate his concepts.  Further, he doesn't go overboard and spend too much time on one subject.

If I can be disciplined to stick to these concepts and techniques, I am confident that my abilities will improve greatly.

There are two minor negatives:

1 - as I watch the video, I can't help but think that I would like to have his pedal - but I know it isn't required, just wish he would use a few other pedals for some demonstrations to negate the feeling

2 - it would be nice if one of the DVD's had PDF content to print out for exercises or bullet points to summarize his concepts so that after watching the video you can take the documents and refer to them for pointers.

Overall, an informative and entertaining video that should benefit a lot of drummers.",1435017600,,1059,4.313131313131313

Many explanations and Jojo indicates his own choice of settings.
I think this is a must have for any drummer, as techniques go from basic to advanced. Jojo doesn't play double bass drums, so this technique is dedicated to single bass drum pedals. You can train left foot the same way as the right one but you won't find specific double pedal techniques in the DVD.

It is.  He takes foot technique and makes it just as interesting and vital to being a well rounded musician as the first DVD did for hand technique. And just as entertaining.

6637852,5,B00NBJ9D9G,"Jojo has put a lot of work into this DVD and the amount of information is so high it's well worth the $27 price tag at Amazon (it's also worth waiting in line for it to become available). You will be working on foot exercises for a long time and the way he explains it is almost as if he were there with you guiding the way. He clearly states this is not a DVD to learn blast beats our double bass pedal. But if you master what he shows in both feet, George Kollias will have serious competition.

A few notes:
-- Disc 1 has a short introduction and Jojo goes straight to business teaching the basic motions of bass drum pedal technique. This evolves into more and more complex and efficient motions to activate the bass drum pedal at fast tempos. You will benefit if you've watched the hand technique DVD because the principles of motion between hand and foot are similar especially in the more advanced techniques (ie Moeller). The camera angles are the best possible and I can't imagine how the whole topic could be explained with more clarity. It feels like after this DVD, there's no reason for another one on foot technique.

-- Disc 2 is more of a historical and technical overview of bass drum pedals and how they influenced technique and music. It may be less appealing to those who just want to play, but as in everything, knowing a bit of history and the evolving mechanics of a device makes you much more empowered to adapt to techniques and troubleshoot equipment. It also makes you more cultured when talking to drummers who are more advanced/educated. Jojo also discusses the use of leather soles as a means to slide the foot, which is very interesting, as well as sitting position/height/etc.

-- Disc 3 focuses on the hi hat foot and again clearly demonstrates how the techniques discussed in Disc 1 should be used in this context. It's not as elaborate as Disc 1, and this is good because he avoids too much repetition since the concepts are the same. But it is still very important as Jojo discusses the nuances of the hi hat mechanism and how to use efficient biomechanics to play it.

-- There are several performances throughout the 3 DVDs. Some are short beats as in the hand DVD and other are playing with musicians including his father. It is clear Jojo wanted to show his versatility as he plays in a latin-jazz, techno, country-rock, drum and bass etc and he does it really well. These performances are a real treat and all musicians are top-notch.

In summary, if you're serious about playing better and having top notch footwork, buy this DVD.",1416960000,3,2572,4.546436285097192

Great amount of detail, particularly when he goes into discussing how to use the tools, such as the hi-hat and bass drum.  Great balance of concept and detailed instruction and performance.  Great follow up to the first DVD.",1481587200,,339,5.090909090909091

The mechanics of the feet have been a mystery to me for so long.
This DVD teaches you from the ground up on how to think about executing proper strokes. - total life saver !!

I now play exclusively out of the bass drum and it is so heavenly. - De Johnette buries it

The balancing act is easily overcome with both heels up and the sound (I am a recording engineer) is just so much more open, resonant and powerful.

Low dynamics for Jazz with heels up are a quirky challenge but worth every minute of practice. I love to see the beater bounce back off the head and rest at a dead stand-still every time. - much more gratifying than fast (show-off) doubles
Splash hats on and off beat were such a breeze just after the first 5 minutes of the chapter. - remember Jo used to do that disco thing...?

Terms like 'wind-up' still make me saliva.

Many Jizzers used to be tap dancers before they became Jojos.",1466467200,,1020,4.231958762886598
