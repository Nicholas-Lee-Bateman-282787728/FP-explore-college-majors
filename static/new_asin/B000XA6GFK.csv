8227515,5,B000XA6GFK,"Mysterious Human Heart is a series I saw on PBS, and kept coming back to.  When they stopped streaming it, I missed it, and was very excited to see I could buy it and watch whenever I want. This series of 3 episodes explains clearly and in human terms several issues that hearts can face.  Very educational and engaging.",1389830400,4,320,4.406779661016949
