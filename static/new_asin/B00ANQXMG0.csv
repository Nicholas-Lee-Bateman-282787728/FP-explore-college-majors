5460584,5,B00ANQXMG0,"A really good documentary and not without some of the warts about the Bond franchise that show no signs of ever ending.  I had wished there were more from Sean Connery but knowing his feelings on the franchise and his treatment, you have to make do with comments made while promoting other films (most notably Rising Sun).  George Lazenby pulls no punches on how he ended up losing what could have been a promising start of a career.  Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan all add interesting bits.  Especailyl amusing is Pierce Brosnan's thoughts on how outlandish parts of Die Another Day were. Good background info on the producers from family members and the current producers.  If you're a Bond fanatic, this is a must for you.

Be advised though this is only available on foreign import dvd.",1473120000,4,820,4.780141843971631

5460592,5,B00ANQXMG0,"He has been with us for over 50 years now.  With the exception of the wildly successful Batman and Superman comic book characters, so many have come and gone, but James Bond has endured.  People like to read about heroes, the man who is put into desperate situations and overcomes incredible odds.  He travels to exotic lands, overcomes the unbelievable criminal element, and sleeps with gorgeous women.  Who didn't want to be James Bond?  This documentary looks at the man who we all aspired to be, the man who is in the shadows, the one who protects us, the most successful movie franchise of all time : James Bond.

From the inception of the books by Ian Flemming post Cold War to the casting of Daniel Craig, James Bond became the man who embodies class, mystery and style.  Flemming chose a very quiet name for the man who he wished to be his alter ego, James Bond was the name of a man who published a bird watching guide in the West Indies.  They all laughed at him, saying that his ridiculous idea of jumping from the books to film was never going to happen, but Flemming made it happen with his partner, Cubby Broccoli.  He believed if you worked hard any dream was possible.  And he made the dream happen, even when they told him they would approve of his doing it for television rather than films.  Their dreams turned into one of the greatest entertainment ventures for the world.  They took a serious risk and made it happen, bringing us Sean Connery, then later Roger Moore now known as the Old School, and the faulty road traveled by George Latzenby, then Timothy Dalton, Pierce Bronson, and the most successful of the New School, Daniel Craig.

I don't care how out of date or how foolish people think I am, James Bond is the sexiest man EVER.  He has endured through history as the world changed, especially when The Cold War ended.  He's still relevant, he's still with us, and our world has changed, but he endures through us.  This is a wonderful documentary about the man who we all wished we were.",1444694400,,2019,4.5054945054945055
5460593,5,B00ANQXMG0,"Well produced and a balanced presentation, making the James Bond legend wasn't all champagne and cavier. Explores the age old question, who makes a legendary character. ...the book writer, the screen writer, the actor, or the movie producer/director/editor. There is no answer that is adequate other than all of them.",1444176000,,317,5.36
5460594,5,B00ANQXMG0,"Extremely well done and remarkably candid, this expansive documentary will make you want to revisit every Bond film again.  Ian Fleming changed our medium and the men and women that served 007 on screen and off are all given fair due.  James Bond has endured by changing with the times, even after directly changing the times during the 60s.  Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan and Craig are all part of a proud legacy.",1444089600,,425,4.794520547945205

5460597,5,B00ANQXMG0,"Very thorough documentary about how and why the James Bond character was created.  Provides some insight into who Ian Fleming was and how his novels  became movies. Then, it gives an in-depth explanation of how the movie franchise came to be and how it has endured for several decades. As the documentary progresses, it reveals intimate details about the producers of the most enduring movie franchise of all time.  Within this documentary, there are lessons to be learned about believing in your dream, faith in your product having vision for a product  and the power of the imagination. Also, this documentary subtly illustrates what can happen when you are overwhelmed with success, jealousy, greed and lack of vision.  In the end, those  who understood the lessons lived long and prospered. Those who did not, we're not so fortunate. This documentary illustrates a perfect example of all of the aspects of great success, that includes triumph, trajedy, endurance and the wisdom to keep a franchise going in this ever-changing world in which we live in.",1443139200,2,1056,5.040229885057471
5460598,4,B00ANQXMG0,"Great insider info on one of my favorite authors and character.  Really explains the varied parade of actors and what was behind it all.  Excellent interviews with mist of the actors and their approach to playing Bond, except Connery who apparently did not cooperste, only thing missing.",1439683200,,287,5.085106382978723
5460599,5,B00ANQXMG0,"Very well -researched documentary with little-known insides and background info. Only complaint I had was why wasn't Michael G.Wilson identified right away, as others were with on-screen ID? Minor flaw in otherwise excellent doco.",1438819200,,230,5.794117647058823

5460605,5,B00ANQXMG0,"This is a very well made documentary of Ian Flemings James Bond following the literary origins, the transition to the cinema, the popularity of the Bond, the Bond phenomenon and the sustained success of the cinematic Bond for over 50 years. This production relies primarily on the input of the filmmakers and the people who were there. I highly recommend this one. Close attention is paid to the choice of Sean Connery and his success. The comments and commentaries are quite candid throughout. Christopher Lee, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Steven Saltzman, Judy Geeson, Lucy Fleming, Barbara Broccoli, Michael Wilson are key contributors along with many others. It covers all the filmed productions, court cases and trails and tribulations. I really did enjoy this and I liked it and I cannot recommend it enough.",1413417600,4,817,5.150375939849624

5460608,5,B00ANQXMG0,"The history of the James Bond book and film series, told by those who created it...
An absolute MUST for 007 fans.

Loads of back story on Ian Fleming, film producers Broccoli & Saltzman and the litigious input of Kevin McClory.  On camera comments by all the men who played Bond in the movies.  And some very effective use of all that amazing John Barry soundtrack music.

Since I've heard of no plans to release a DVD of this in America, I went for the digital download.",1395705600,4,472,4.390804597701149
8554785,4,B00ANQXMG0,"...such a good backstory to a movie that I remember my brother telling me about back in the 60's. Eventually I would go on to become a fan too. My two favorites as I came to age was Live and Let Die, and Moonraker. The older and new Bond flicks are good as well... but these two had scripts that appealed to me personally. This Documentary is well made considering the context, but I was also happy to see all of the actors who played the role. Give it a watch, I don't think you'll be disappointed!!!",1521936000,,501,4.175257731958763

8554787,4,B00ANQXMG0,"""Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007"" (2012 release; 98 min.) is a documentary about the James Bond movie franchise (which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2012). After a 'classic' Bond opening, we quickly delve into Ian Fleming's background, and in particular how deeply affected he was by WWII (in which he served) and later the Cold War. It eventually leads him to create the James Bond character, and the first Bond novel ""Casino Royal"", which some refers to as Fleming's ""autobiography of a dream"", ha! After this promising start to the documentary, we quickly evolve into the complicated relationship between Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman.

Couple of comments: this documentary is directed by British film maker Steven Riley. Riley tries to walk a fine line between on the one hand all of the legal issues that have confronted the James Bond franchise over the years (and believe me, there are PLENTY), and giving an overview of how the Bond movies have evolved over the years. There are some tidbits here and there that I found interesting (such as: the budget for the first Bond Movie ""Mr. NO"" being $1 million--or about $8 million in today's dollars, can you imagine making a Bond movie for just $8 million?; and the interview with one-time Bond actor George Lazenby, on how he talked Broccoli and Saltzman into becoming the new Bond, only then to be kicked out of the Bond franchise after just one movie).

I recently stumbled on this while browsing the EPIX on Demand documentary section. When a 50th anniversary celebration movie like this one is put together, you can be assured that it stays on the lighter side when all is said and done, and that's fine. I'm sure one day someone (independent from the Bond film makers) will produce the definitive James Bond documentary.",1515456000,,1812,4.87987012987013

8554789,5,B00ANQXMG0,"Very refreshing and informative.  I thought I knew some of the behind-the-scenes Bond history, but this goes deep.
