8653237,5,B00JQAXQUG,"David Shepard has done it again. His release, ""We're in the Movies"" is a beautiful slice of silent film history. There are two documentaries featured on both the standard DVD and the Blu-ray disc. If you like history or film preservation this DVD is for you. ""When you Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose"" takes the viewer through the process of how the Paragon Film Company made the 1914 film, ""The Lumberjack."" Paragon went from city to city and made ""Home Talent Movies"" using local residence as the actors. The relatives of the stars in this documentary lead the viewer through the making of this film. The restored film in question is also on this DVD. ""Palace of Silents"" is the true story of the silent film theater (Old Time Movies) built in 1942 in Los Angeles. When all the other theaters in Southern California were showing sound films, this 150-seat run silent films. The theater had a sixty-eight year run. This is a prime example of how life can be stranger than fiction. The owners of this theater did not get rich from showing silent films. But, they created a lot of wonderful memories. A lot of these memories are on the DVD. There are also many bonus features on the disc. The silent film music on this disc is also a bit different. No piano or orchestra, only a ragtime trio. The music is delightful and of the toe tapping variety..",1420156800,,1355,4.489878542510121
8653238,5,B00JQAXQUG,"The independent DVD/BD label Flicker Alley has done a yeoman's job of releasing rare silent films - mostly comedies (Mack Sennetts, Chaplin) but also newly restored versions of classic silents.  This, their newest release, is somewhat different but really entertaining.  The package includes both a Bluray and a DVD with the same contents - two documentaries that have one thing in common - silent films and their effect on a local community.

The first is ""When You Wore a Tulip and I wore A big Red Rose"" a 1983 documentary film about were often called ""local talent films"". From 1914-1916 a company called Paragon Feature Film Company, would show up in small towns and offer to make a ""feature film"" which would use local people as the actors and promote the towns attractions. The filmmakers would be paid by the community and the community would get the film. There were hundreds of these made all over the country and - since they were on explosive nitrate film stock - very few survived. Documentarian and film collector Stephen Schaller went to the town of Wausau, WI and discovered the actual reel of film for the movie ""The Lumberjack"" and had it restored. He was also able to find some of the residents who were in the film and were then in their 80s or 90s. He filmed interviews with them - as well as with a woman who was a piano player for the silent films. It's a fascinating story and this fil runs just over an hour.

The other documentary is more recent - 2014. ""Palace of Silents"" tells the store of The Silent Movie Theater of Los Angeles (yes, that's the name of the theater), which was started in 1942 to show nothing but silent films (accompanied at first by 78rpm phonograph records to perform as the soundtrack. It had three owners over the years, but I won't tell you more. Like a good movie, the story of TSMTofLA has mystery, crime, robbery, deceit and sexual identity issues all rolled into one fascinating story. The 76 minute film will actually keep you guessing as to how it sends.

Flicker Alley has added some nice bonuses to the set: a half-dozen restored silent films. The prime one is the complete 16-minute version of the aforementioned Wausau film, ""The Lumberjack"". There is also another ""local cast"" film titled ""The Kidnapper's Foil"". The remaining ones capture life in remote regions at that time, such as ""Moonshine Country"" and ""Mountain Life""
""The Lumberjack"" is the longest and this, and three other of the films, has a new ""soundtrack"" by a mandolin, guitar and mandolin-banjo trio named the Ragtime Skedaddlers. While it worked okay for me for the film ""Mountain Life:, I found it at odds with the story line of ""The Lumberjack"". The ragtime music is repetitive and doesn't fit the mood. Flicker Alley usually adds piano or organ accompaniment which is coordinated with the action. A piano would be more appropriate it. I rewatched ""The Lumberjack"" with the ""mute"" button on and I actually enjoyed it better.

The ""deluxe package"" includes a nice 12 page book of essays on the films.
For anyone interested in silent films, the BD/DVD is a must see.  Both are highly entertaining and Flicker Alley should be thanked for making them available.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
