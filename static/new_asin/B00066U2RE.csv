8361897,5,B00066U2RE,"It only takes a suitcaseful of uranium to make a bomb that could wipe out New York City.  The instructions for nuclear bomb-making are terrifyingly simple and widely available.  But $13 billion could buy up the entire known stock of nuclear materials--if only we would do it.  That $13 billion is only a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions of dollars of damage from a nuclear attack.  Is America Safer? leaves us with a clear message:  nuclear terrorism is preventable.

  America has become the most hated country in the world, and filmmaker Tom Selinski shows this fact alone to be our most dangerous threat. Our administration can no longer afford to pick and choose the ""good guys"" from the ""bad guys"" when a role-reversal is inevitable.  Secrecy is no longer a valid security tactic.  We can no longer put faith in the other's incompetence.  The 9/11 should have taught us to erase the racist assumption that people ""over there"" couldn't be smart enough or organized enough to attack the all-mighty U.S.A.  We should know better by now, and wise up to the possibility of nuclear terrorism.  Is America Safer? brings home the queasy, apocalyptic--but entirely preventable--reality of a nuclear war.",1114992000,,1213,4.945544554455446
8361898,5,B00066U2RE,"Tom Selinski's film, 'Nuclear Terrorism: Is America Safer? is a timely, well researched  film about preventing nuclear terrorism.

This film not only points out the current dangers to the world,  but lays out a path for securing nuclear materials from terrorists.
