8034097,1,B0002X8RT6,"Awful from start to finish.  Poor video quality, poor audio, poor story; it's like something you'd see on New York's local MNN channels only with nudity.  I can't imagine who would give either movie on this collection more than one star; there must have been a lot of friends of the producers posting reviews.  Not worth your time or your money.  I tried to give both ""movies"" an even break but once I came across the scene when the actors are running against a green screen, I gave up being impartial.

Not even ""so bad it's good,"" just ""so bad.""",1137456000,2,547,4.43
8034098,4,B0002X8RT6,"These movies are worth watching for sure they are great examples of what can be done with a small budget.  Quality films that are entertaining and fun.  If you're a movie snob then don't bother but for those of us who just like to forget about things for a couple of hours these are perfect.  Joe Zaso is a very sexy actor and plays the perv to perfection, im looking forward to more of him for sure.",1109721600,4,400,4.1688311688311686
8034099,4,B0002X8RT6,"I picked up this DVD recently because I recognized a lot of the names involved: Tina Krause (TITANIC 2000), Darian Caine (MISTRESS FRANKENSTEIN), Joseph Zaso (NIKOS THE IMPALER), Sasha Graham (VICIOUS SWEET) and Joseph Parda (5 DEAD ON THE CRIMSON CANVAS).  They've all done a number of low-to-no budget direct-to-video horror films over the years and these two hard-to-find titles was a pleasant surprise to uncover.  ""And Then They Were Dead"" is a goofy and violent TEN LITTLE INDIANS-type affair.  The story is slight and the camera work is at times lacking, but it's gory, sexy, funny and has a fantastic score by Function Zero.  Darian Caine does a hot shower death scene!  Also included for this title are some nice extras including a behind-the-scenes documentary.  The better of the two films is GUILTY PLEASURES which is two stories that create one feature.  Again, it's sexy, gory and at times - oddly funny, but overall and interesting effort.  Both films have amusing audio commentaries. Are these films mega Hollywood productions?  Absolutely not.  But they are made with a certain vitality and love of horror/suspense/exploitation films that makes them enjoyable. I watch a lot of Euro Horror (Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Sergio Martino...) and I think it definitely keeps the same spirit -- even though the budgets of these films were clearly a lot less.  Definitely give this DVD a try because one way or another, you'll find it entertaining (even if you find it schlocky).",1099267200,7,1501,5.036437246963563
8034100,1,B0002X8RT6,"Wow, where to begin with these ""movies"" (and I use that term loosely). These two gems are shining examples of why camcorders should be more expensive, so that hopefully people as relentlessly untalented as the group that put this embarrassing garbage together wouldn't be able to even attempt to pass crap like this off as legitimate film. Both are literally shot with what appear to be cheap camcorders, which would be all right if the content was at least interesting or well done. It's not. They don't even qualify as fun indi films. I've seen better written, acted and directed junior high school productions, and I mean that seriously. The acting in both films is SO bad it's actually embarrassing to watch. Joseph Zaso particularly is so horrible you'll find yourself unsure if you should laugh at him or if that would just be too cruel, because he so clearly thinks he's brilliant. Another male ""actor"" grins through the entire thing with a look somewhere between Rain Man and Special Ed on Crank Yankers, and delivers his lines like someone might in an SNL skit.  Only he's serious. It's so pathetic it's actually disturbing. Thankfully, I cannot remember his name, but watch this and you'll know who I mean the instant you see his ""no one's home in here"" stare, his cretinous grin and line delivery a toddler could improve upon. There's some gratuitous nudity too, of course, tossed in with the mind-numbingly awful writing and acting, but they can't even manage to pull that off. If you like watching aging, flabby, badly tattooed small-time stripper rejects take their clothes off in bad lighting, AND THEN THEY WERE DEAD is definitely for you. And don't even get me started on the second ""movie"" GUILTY PLEASURES.  EXCRUTIATING TO WATCH would be a far more apt title. Hey, garbage video is one thing, but the problem with these little epics is that they're not even professional and shouldn't be presented as such.  This is amateur nonsense, and that's OK, but bill it as that.  Don't package it and promote it like legitimate film and steal people's money with crap two mentally challeneged, stoned fourteen year olds wouldn't take credit for on their worst day.  Is it possible to give negative stars? THERE ARE NUMEROUS TERRIFIC LOW BUDGET INDI FILMS OUT THERE, SUPPORT THEM, NOT THIS FOOLISHNESS. Trust me, DO NOT waste your money on this.",1098835200,4,2355,4.833746898263027
8034101,5,B0002X8RT6,"This was a Great BUY!

For 14.99 You get 2 films that both are really well done. I highly recommend this double feature purchase!",1093910400,8,129,4.375
