But you will not find a better deal on the fight itself anywhere else. I have a collection of great fights. And this Pacquiao fight was one to remember. I own Pacquiao career set through 2004. I buy the other fights with Grandes Peleas. Too bad for Margarito's eye! He'll probably lose it completely after this year. We just watched Cotto/Margarito, another fight I'll purchase from Grandes Peleas when it comes out.",1323043200,2,539,4.795698924731183

- Manny Pacquiao vs. Antonio Margarito (November 13, 2010)

You could tell which way the wind was blowing when, after the tenth round, in Margarito's corner, trainer Robert Garcia frantically asked his battered boxer: ""Tell me, how are you, bast@rd?!""

With the Cowboys having stunk up the NFL something awful, there was a dreadful need for a diversion in big Texas. Thankfully, the Filipino congressman managed to clear his legislative docket enough that he could resume his boxing career and fight the infamous big bad Antonio Margarito. This contest took place in Arlington, Texas. The Cowboys were so awful that season that, by the time the night ended, Manny would have two victories in 2010 - compared to the Cowboys' one win - in Jerry Jones's jaw-dropping Cowboy Stadium.

When it comes to size, Pacman bends the laws of physics. In training for this one, Pacquiao eschewed the protein shakes and extra meals and the need to gain weight, instead opting to stay lighter on his feet and thus maximizing his edge in speed. As it were, on fight night, Margarito weighed 165 pounds, with Manny a game 148. Margo already loomed with a four and a half inch height advantage. There were locker room controversies, of course, even though both trainers denied playing head games. But there was some issue with Manny's wrapping and some notion that Margo had possibly ingested Hydroxycut which contains the illegal substance, Ephedra (but it could've been just Splenda). Even before the locker room shenanigans, there was Margarito and Brandon Rios's clowning on Freddy Roach's Parkinson's disease, and their asshat move was caught on video. Plenty of side stories to fuel this exciting but one-sided fight.

Jim Lampley sums it up best: ""He's a former flyweight beating up one of the biggest welterweights we ever saw."" What we saw was a little guy opening a can on a big guy, a big guy who kept on coming and who could take a punch and who had something to prove. Pacquiao could've followed a smarter game plan, could've been content with boxing from a safe distance. But Pac is a born fighter, and he wanted to establish his own physicality. Still, there was nervous tension in the air. There was a time when the Tijuana Tornado was regarded as the most feared, most avoided boxer in the sport. Certainly I was flashing back to Margarito's best days when he sacked and pillaged victims like Cintron, Cotto, and ""Six Heads"" Lewis.

Margarito in the opening round unexpectedly launched a barrage of solid jabs, but that didn't last. Pacquiao rapidly put his stamp on the fight, with his in-and-out movement and buzzsaw salvos. Margo was quick to say in his corner that Pacquiao had no punch, and yet he visibly winced in the fourth round from a Pacman body shot. As the rounds progressed, Margo's eyes began to swell shut (initiated by Pac's wicked uppercut), his face transmogrifying into this grotesque gargoyle mask. Margo did his inch of damage in the middle rounds with body punches and uppercuts. Late in the sixth round, Margo caught Manny on the ropes and erupted with a combination of body shots which visibly affected Manny. Manny later owned up that that round had put him in an odd sticky patch. But every time Margo landed something, Manny promptly retaliated with crunching flurries. Pacquiao was feeling so good he even did a sort of Ali shuffle in the seventh round. It was a near shutout performance, Manny delivering sustained punishment on the Tijuana Tornado. But as Manny's trainer Freddy Roach said about Margo on HBO's 24/7: ""He thinks he's a tornado. F*****' real tornado's coming."" Lucky for Margo, Pacquiao took pity and carried the swolled-face dude thru the twelfth and final round. Give Margarito his due, he never quit. As I write this, I'm getting excited for the upcoming Margarito/Cotto rematch.

- Juan Manuel Lopez vs. Rafael Marquez (November 6, 2010)

There was a time when JuanMa Lopez was viewed as this unstoppable force, never mind that even back then his chin was considered to be juuuust a bit suspect. Fresh off his epic war with Rogers Mtagwa, he then took on a future Hall of Famer in the great hard-punching technician Rafael Marquez, and their impending match was highly anticipated. And it lived up to the hype, mostly. Not to mention that age-old Mexican-Puerto Rican rivalry fed even more fuel to the fire.

From jump, the advantages went to JuanMa. He was younger than his 35-year-old opponent. He was the naturally bigger man. And it wasn't him who'd faced the mighty Israel Vasquez in four fights, three of which are classic barnburners. Lopez from the start exploited his size, and even though Rafa was game as could be and even managed to wobble Lopez with his left hooks (especially in the fourth round), ultimately, Lopez's power took its toll. Round 7 would be a monster boon for the fans as the two warriors went at it furiously, but Lopez got the best of that one, too. From then on, the writing was on the wall, really. Marquez was so fatigued that he was stumbling around the ring. The gallant warhorse was unable to answer the bell for the ninth round, citing a right shoulder injury. But it's cool, Orlando Salido would have Marquez's back. Five months later, Salido fought JuanMa Lopez and knocked him out. Somewhere Rafa and Rogers Mtagwa are shaking their heads, muttering: ""Yeah, well, I softened him up for you.""

- Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Sammy Fuentes (November 18, 1989)

Observing Fuentes's sustained and gutty effort in this one, Larry Merchant remarked: ""Sammy Fuentes can fight a little bit, I'll say that."" Except that you have to fight more than just ""a little bit"" to impact the greatest fighter in Mexico's history. Sammy Fuentes, a Puerto Rican triathlete, maintained his frenetic pace for five rounds or so, but then Chavez shook off the doldrums and started to really chop wood. You have to give it up for Fuentes who was game as can be. But blunt force trauma will have the final say and Fuentez eventually lost the sizzle on his bacon. Chavez's accuracy and iron will power and vaunted body assault once more won him the day as Fuentes elected to retire after the tenth round, leaving ringside commentator Jim Lampley to marvel at ""the clinical viciousness of Julio Cesar Chavez."" For the triviaheads, Sugar Ray Leonard took time off from his training for the third Roberto Duran fight to provide guest commentary in the fourth round.

- Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez vs. Carlos Baldomir (September 18, 2010)

One of the most bittersweet moments in a boxer's career is when he deteriorates past his prime and becomes what is known as a gatekeeper, good only for testing up-and-coming blue chippers. Carlos Baldomir once upon a time was a world champion, a guy salty enough that he beat Zab Judah and knocked out Arturo Gatti. For this one, Baldomir vowed to ""knock the freckles"" off his opponent. But in this new reality, young Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez, still raw but reeking of serious potential, made early work of the sluggish veteran. This bout was clearly a showcase for the aggressive Canelo or ""Cinnamon"" (kid is Mexican but looks like a red-headed white boy from the Midwest), and to quote Larry Merchant after Canelo dropped Baldomir in the sixth with an almighty left hook: ""That wasn't a cinnamon stick."" Canelo, at twenty-one years old, is already a huge draw in Mexico, where he is regarded as a heartthrob by them impressionable girls. Thankfully, in the squared circle, he also looks to be the real deal, threatening to fill in that void left by his promoter Oscar de la Hoya.",1315699200,,7588,4.818740399385561
