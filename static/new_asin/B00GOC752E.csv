Judy shines in three of her best roles, my favorite The Solid Gold Cadillac. I've had never seen Down to Earth. My mother used to speak fondly of this film and it seems to have had been an influence on the film Xanadu. the latter being an inferior remake which I enjoyed just the same.",1500422400,,396,4.513888888888889

Solid Gold Cadillac: Very fun movie. Probably worth the cost of this set by itself, but still no reason to waste one's time through the rest of the set.

We Were Strangers: Somewhat difficult to follow unless one is completely absorbed in the movie and nothing else. Might have historic value, but little entertainment value.

Angels Over Broadway: This movie is mildly entertaining, but only if one enjoys the gambling genre, not the romantic.

Music In My Heart: Lame plot, lame music. Not worth a second viewing.

The Marrying Kind: Fairly engaging, but still not worth a second viewing. Certainly not a silver screen romance.

It Should Happen to You: Ok fine, begrudgingly entertaining and funny, if one likes Judy Holliday. But her voice annoys me.

Adam Had Four Sons: Excellent movie, if one likes the extreme emotion of Ingrid Bergman. I was actually quite captivated. But still not a silver screen romance.

Down to Earth: Extremely weird movie, not worth watching.

There, have I helped anyone decide not to waste money on this set?",1445126400,5,1293,4.8144796380090495

6095196,4,B00GOC752E,The 2-DVD set was by Mills Creek- There are 8 movies in this set.  I really enjoyed- The Solid Gold Cadillac because it has two of my favorite actors- Judy Holiday and Paul Douglas.  The other movies- It Should Happen to You (Hoilday and Lemmon) and The Marrying Kind (Holiday and Aldo Ray) were solid movies- worth watching.  Another movie in this set was We Were Strangers- John Garfield and Jennifer Jones was superb!  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and the ending will blow you away!

6095206,5,B00GOC752E,"Call it nostalgia, but the older I get the more I look to the past for great films. What you get on this Mill Creek Entertainment collection are eight solid films produced by Columbia Pictures from 1940 to 1956. This is a two-disc collection with four films on each disc. Because these are one-sided discs, there are zero extras included--not even closed captioning. But for the price, these films are a real bargain. The overall picture quality runs from good to very good. The sound quality is excellent. Here's what you get:

""Solid Gold Cadillac"" (1956, 99 min., black & white/color) Worth noting:  The film is narrated by George Burns; also, the final scene (about 30 seconds) was shot in technicolor to show off the ""solid gold Cadillac."" The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) gave it a 7.6 rating out of 10.

""We Were Strangers"" (1949, 105 min, black & white) Directed by John Huston right after ""Key Largo"" and before ""The Asphalt Jungle."" IMDB rating: 6.7

""Angels over Broadway"" (1940, 79 min, black & white) IMDB rating: 6.6

""Music in My Heart"" (1940, 70 min, black & white) This is a musical; ""It's a Blue World"" is sung by Tony Martin and was nominated for an Oscar; music by Andre Kastelanetz. IMDB rating: 6.3

""The Marrying Kind"" (1952, 92 min., black & white) IMDB rating: 7.0

""It Should Happen to You"" (1954, 87 min., black & white) This was Jack Lemmon's first major film role. IMDB rating: 7.3

""Adam Had Four Sons"" (1941, 80 min., black & white) Fay Wray (of ""King Kong"" fame) is included in this film. IMDB rating:  6.5

""Down to Earth"" (1947, 101 min., color) This musical comedy is a sequel to 1941's ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" plus it is the only film shot in technicolor. Note: All vocals are dubbed; none of the on-screen performers actually sing.  IMDB rating:  6.3

Overall, these are enjoyable films at an unbeatable price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1428537600,67,1869,4.696319018404908

I was drawn to this DVD set for three reasons: 1) I happen to appreciate classic films, 2) price point being under $6.00, 3) I like the diverse appearance of famous actors featured here. My personal favorite is Rita Hayworth (go figure, I'm a guy). Rita owns a good portion of this collection, and she lights up the screen like a torch! This is a real steal for several hours of quality entertainment with exceptionally good picture quality. Top the whole thing off with two disks, each containing 4 movies, on one side of disk.

Most, but not all, are in black-and-white.  Selections range in quality from the cheapie ANGELS OVER BROADWAY and the high-gloss but underdeveloped ADAM HAD FOUR SONS, a family saga that introduces Susan Heyward as a flirtatious and home-wrecking opportunist, to THE MARRYING KIND, a Judy Holliday film, introducing Aldo Ray, as a divorcing couple on the skids who are forced to confront their disappointing marriage.  The most offbeat in the suite is probably DOWN TO EARTH, a Rita Hayworth musical in color that comes across as strangely flat.  With the possible exception of the three Judy Holliday comedies (THE MARRYING KIND, IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU and THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC), none of these movies is of five-star quality, but none will make you turn off the DVD player in disgust.  And at this price, you can play the field.",1416182400,4,1005,4.923076923076923
6095230,5,B00GOC752E,"This is absolutely one of the very best old movie collections I have ever bought. I just finished watching all of these, and every one was great! All in perfect crystal clear quality too. Only the last movie is in color. The rest are black and white. There are 3 with Judy Holliday, and 2-3 with Rita Hayworth. I am a big fan of Judy Holliday, and have a few more of her films...one being Born Yesterday...which is a favorite all time movie of mine. I think she won an Academy award for that one. These are delightful films and fine for the entire family to see. Well worth the money!!! I would have paid much more if I hd known how good they were.",1416009600,9,648,4.192

Two out of the eight are in Widescreen format. For under $10, this is a bargain for the amount and the quality of the films. The down side is that there is no subtitles, no other languages other than English and there is no special features included with this collection. There are two disks with no double sided disks, with four films on each disk.",1397520000,74,518,4.350515463917525

8625499,5,B00GOC752E,"I bought this mainly for the 3 Judy Holliday films, and they are all wonderful indeed.  What a great talent she was, and what wonderful films she appeared in! My favorites are ""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" in which she plays a small stockholder, Laura Partridge, who takes on a big corporation's board of directors, and ""It Should Happen To You"" where she plays Gladys Glover, who decides she would like to make a famous name for herself by renting a prominent billboard in NYC, leading to a still very relevant and funny film about the nature of fame in a celebrity-obsessed culture.  Plus she plays opposite Jack Lemmon, making his auspicious film debut, and Peter Lawford as a sexy ladies' man.  The third film, more of a comedy-drama ""The Marrying Kind"" examines a marriage mostly in flashbacks when Judy and husband Aldo Ray come before a judge to end their union.  These films were written  by such famous and accomplished writers Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin (playwright of her most famous film ""Born Yesterday"") and George S. Kaufman and Abe Burrows and directed by George Cukor and Richard Quine, and are very high quality films.  They certainly hold up to repeated viewing, and the first two especially are wonderfully funny escapist entertainment.  The charming, beautiful and hilariously funny Judy Holliday made too few films in her short life, but these are among her best.

The 5 other films are very interesting as well.  I particularly liked ""Adam Had 4 Sons"" with Ingrid Bergman, Warner Baxter and Susan Hayward, ""We Were Strangers"" with John Garfield and Jennifer Jones, and Rita Hayworth was lovely in the others.  This collection is a very good value indeed!",1525132800,,1675,4.886925795053004
