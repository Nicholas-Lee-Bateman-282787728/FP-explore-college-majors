8689814,5,B00PYMP7WA,"Remember this can not be played on a US player. You need a converter for European format. The series is excellent for anyone interested in how medieval castles were built and why they were built the way they were, along with information about the craftsmen who built them. The company that sold it was excellent to deal with. They would have let me return it once I realized my equipment wouldn't play it but I was able to get it converted.",1528156800,,440,4.444444444444445
8689815,5,B00PYMP7WA,"As a big fan of Tudor Monastery Farm I was expecting the same level of cinematography and although this DVD set's post production resulted in a lot of washed out color, I still loved the content and scripting. Well worth the purchase, plays fine on my US Xbox One, Ruth Peter and ""Tommo"" are wonderful presenters. They do not come across as professional actors to me which makes watching this series so much more authentic and engaging. I was simply amazed at what could be accomplished using a rudimentary plumb line, compass, level and a couple of chisels.

I hope they re-master this and Tudor Farm for Blu Ray for the States some day. What would be even better: Make a Part 2 of the Farm (surely there must be more content that they could cover) in 4K Blu Ray.",1526688000,,764,4.457142857142857

8689818,5,B00PYMP7WA,"This was a great departure from Ruth and Peter's normal ""farm"" adventures. It was fascinating to watch and informative and amusing. Our whole family - from the 75 yr old to the 4 yr old - loved it.",1516147200,,197,4.2105263157894735

8689821,5,B00PYMP7WA,"I have seen every single ""farm"" series they have ever done. I LOVE Ruth Goodman... I am such a nerdy fan-girl. She's my total SHE-RO. The work they put into these series and the living history these guys are exploring -- there's no true value you can apply to it because it is priceless. These videos are helping to catalog and preserve knowledge on the brink of extinction. Fascinating from start to finish. If you haven't seen the other series you should get them also. You will not be disappointed.",1456704000,6,501,4.5777777777777775
8689822,5,B00PYMP7WA,"The latest series about life in past times, following on from Tales from the Green Valley, Victorian Farm, Victorian Pharmacy, Edwardian Farm, Wartime Farm, and Tudor Monastery Farm. This time the team are sharing in the experiences of a team of French experts recreating a medieval castle. As usual, the indefatigable Ruth Goodman is there to show us how people did things, and as always she is enthusiastic. The loose medieval gown she wears is 'the most comfortable thing' she's ever worn, and rushes, she and her companions agree, make the floor of their modest home nice and warm. With tireless enthusiasm they take you through every aspect of medieval daily living and show in fascinating detail how a real castle was built. Like all the previous series, this one is packed with fascinating information, and like Ruth and the others, you will be sorry when it comes to an end. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the time period!",1456358400,8,942,4.89375
8689823,5,B00PYMP7WA,This is sooo educational!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!,1452124800,,65,4.0
