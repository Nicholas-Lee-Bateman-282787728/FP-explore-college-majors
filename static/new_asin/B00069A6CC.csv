2179265,5,B00069A6CC,"Hilarious tongue-in-cheek political satire, glamorizing ""terrorist chic"", and sexing it up to the extreme.  You really need an open mind to enjoy this film.  Some people focus on the questionable acting, but I believe it was all intentional.  The blending of hardcore sex and politics is brilliant.  Only Bruce Labruce could pull it off.  It's hilarious and titillating, and yes, the plot is ridiculous, but it's meant to be.  That's kind of the point.  The ridiculousness only emphasizes the underlying message of the film.  Make love, not war.  Filled with the best catch lines ever, they stick in your mind long after the film ends.  ""The revolution is my boyfriend"" is one of my favorites.  I actually found it on a t-shirt online, so, of course, I had to buy it.  Some other favorites are:  ""Heterosexuality is the opiate of the masses"", ""Kiss the captive!"", ""Madonna is counter-revolutionary"", ""Have you ever kissed a boy?  I mean a boy kissing a boy"" and many, many more.  The opening scene is so pornographic and comical, you can't help but laugh out loud.  As Gudrun shouts political propaganda while having sex with her boyfriend, another member listens while masturbating with a gun in the next room, using it as a phallus, and then shooting off the gun as he climaxes.  It's great.  It, graphically, prepares you for what's to come (so to speak).  I'm sure the use of guns as phallic symbols has crossed everyone's mind, but Bruce Labruce, as usual, takes everything way over the edge.  It's all over the top, but it's all good.  This is definitely not a film for all tastes, but if you're adventurous, you need to pick this up, and ""ride it like a pony"".",1230076800,17,1667,4.71875
2179266,1,B00069A6CC,"Has to be among the worst movies I've ever watched.  Perhaps I just didn't get it.  Sophmoric would be several steps up.  Terrible acting, ridiculous premise and overall bad filmmaking don't help.",1189987200,5,196,5.0625
2179267,5,B00069A6CC,"My wife and I went to see this and absolutely loved it! If you're okay with watching hardcore sex mixed into a film setting, this film is inspirational in more ways than one...",1188259200,2,176,4.363636363636363
2179268,5,B00069A6CC,"This movie is great!! I loved this movie and through the comedy it does have a point in today's societies. ""Make love, not war"" and ""Sex is revolution war is for imperialists"". I do think that the movie was trying to point out, if there was less sexphobia in the world, there would be less war because this is where hate is stemmed from ""fear"". There is one thing that I do have to say is that the sex that was seen was not ""play sex"" it was real and for that I do commend the writer and director of the movie. For if the sex was ""play"" the whole premise of the movie would have been lost. I did have to laugh in the movie that they were using George Ws face on a dart board. I recommed seeing this movie just for the laughs and pariody.",1172534400,10,737,3.9864864864864864
2179269,5,B00069A6CC,"I loved this movie and think that the way in which it mangaes to melange porn, propaganda, political activism, and gangster flick genres is just really amazing. AND the soundtrack is super, super cool, if you like non main stream electro.",1168300800,4,238,4.829268292682927
2179270,1,B00069A6CC,"If your idea of a good alternative film is one devoid of plot, good acting and any semblance of structure then you might enjoy this piece of utter rubbish.  I think this is a sad homily to gay men who get excited seeing ugly German gay men with shaved pubes getting off with one another and then call it art.",1136505600,8,308,4.133333333333334
2179271,5,B00069A6CC,"i saw this film in Greece, and i'm sure that the American version is probably a little softer than the Europeon (original cut). But i'm not too sure. This film is fantastic! i cant stress that enough. the cinematagraphy... and just the overall satirical and witty premise of the film is worth watching. I think im going to make a t-shirt that says: ""Masturbation is Counter-Revolutionary!""  This movie is so smart...",1127779200,14,416,4.859154929577465
2179272,1,B00069A6CC,"Sad, isn't it, when the DVD extras are better than the movie they are supposedly enhancing?
The story is stupid, the acting is non-existent, the cinematography is done, I assume, with a ""foot-held"" camera but I'm sure that people much smarter than I, much more cool than I, will tell me that I missed the entire point.  Right.  Sure.  This film is slower than ""Alexander"" & ""Gladiator"" put together.  But if listening to faux actors drone on and on about the sexual revolution is your thing, go ahead and buy this DVD.",1126396800,12,518,4.5978260869565215
2179273,5,B00069A6CC,"This film is brilliant. If you know anything of how ridiculous revolutionary left political groups tend to be and are interested in how (gayish) sex can help to show up the madness - this is the film for you. The acting is woeful, but that's not the point, in fact i think it's almost deliberately bad. the storyline is loosely based on the real events of the Red Army Faction in 1970s Germany except that it's all viewed through a comic gay prism. ""Heterosexuality is the opiate of the masses"" and ""put your marxism where your mouth is"" consist some of the clever gay-ified revolutionary slogans littered throughout the film.

Bruce La Bruce has showed his true genius here. whilst pushing an interesting political point about the left he maintains the tongue firmly in the cheek.",1111449600,29,781,4.742647058823529

2179278,5,B00069A6CC,"This is one of my favorite films of all time, but I am a leftist, am fine with nudity and sexuality, am gay, etc.  If you are politically very left or liberal, don't mind sexual films, enjoy political satire that also makes a point, you will love this film.  Everyone will else will hate it or not understand it.  When I first saw this, it blew me away, but I told my friends that probably myself and a very few others would love this.  I'm happy to see so many high rated reviews on here.  I'm sure the one stars didn't get it or were morally opposed.  I think the world needs a lot of change and we need more films like this.",1380499200,3,627,4.056910569105691
2179279,5,B00069A6CC,"Wasn't expecting a lot from this movie, so I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The acting is terrible, but it's still a great foreign film. You must be comfortable with seeing sex, gay and straight, to enjoy it.",1363910400,,222,4.309523809523809
2179280,5,B00069A6CC,"This is my favorite Bruce La Bruce film.

If you like art house, left wing , male nudity, and of all things, political satires, then you will love this movie. I have seen this three times and each time I see something I did not notice the previous times. There is a lot of nudity and random political, propaganda, and downright hilarious messages that appear out of nowhere across the action. These messages are defiantly my favorite parts of the movie and a down right brilliant idea from the director Bruce La Bruce.

I liked this movie because it is far from boring and if you are not gay, you most likely will not take much away from the film. Just remember, THERE IS A LOT OF MALE NUDITY in this film, but I am not complaining. Yes there is a plot as well, so buy it, watch it, and if you are lucky, you will be glad to own this wonderful creative movie.",1361404800,6,859,4.2317073170731705
2179281,1,B00069A6CC,"I highly recommend not getting this movie unless you're into senseless porn. It didn't have a story line and was flashing from scene to scene. Trust me, it's not good. There might be some good reviews on it but I think they just made the mistake of buying it and now are trying to sell it back. Unfortunately, I bought it. Don't make the same mistake!",1328313600,,351,4.333333333333333
2179282,4,B00069A6CC,"If you watched and enjoyed Shortbus, why not take a look at the filmmaker that is undoubtedly a major influence on John Cameron Mitchell?

Bruce LaBruce is an uncompromising person in a world full of watered-down, milquetoast individuals.

I don't want to ruin this film for you, but if you don't find yourself at the very least intellectually aroused by this film then you're not firing on all cylinders- or you're too vanilla to appreciate it fully.",1315612800,,451,4.8441558441558445
2179283,5,B00069A6CC,"Bruce Labruce is one on the most tragically overlooked directors out there! He is one of the few auteurs working today, and it's a tragedy that so few of his films are available.

The plot of The Raspberry Reich is for the most part irrelevant, should you really want a story its there for you, and its surprisingly entertaining for what it is, even offering a rather touching romantic ending. The art of the movie is the execution and the laugh out loud script that you can quote for days without losing any of the novelty.

While as a whole it isn't my favorite Labruce film, it is one of his most original (and that's saying something)

Cult in every sense of the word!",1285113600,6,672,4.403225806451613

8040637,5,B00069A6CC,"I need to ask a question before purchase and that feature is strangely missing from this page. The reviews do say it's racy, it's hot man on man action, it's soft core porn etc . . .but the truth is this is supposed to be two movies edited differently. Rasberry Reich, and The Revolution is My Boyfriend - the exact same movie with all the real sex cut out. Like hard core. I've seen the soft version, but I want to see the full unedited version as the director and studio intended. IF YOU OWN THIS, is it hard core with no blurring of actual sex? We all seem to define ""porn"" in our own way. Explicit is the word I'm looking for. The real movie.",1475884800,,646,4.134920634920635

8040641,5,B00069A6CC,"A delightful satire of sex, revolution and politics.  Not perhaps for the fainthearted, but I found a very well crafted and acted story line with outrageous characters doing very outrageous activities in an entertaining and amusing context.
