5864795,5,B00DY64CR4,"...you win or you die.

When George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire hit bookshelves in the 1990s, it changed the face of contemporary fantasy. Martin takes us to a world of morally ambiguous characters, where heroes and villains aren't who you think they are, and the good guys don't always win in the end. For years Hollywood pestered Mr. Martin for the rights to turn his series into a movie, but his artistic integrity wouldn't allow it. A Song of Ice and Fire is too big, too vast, and too long to be made into a movie series and still do the books justice. The third book alone, A Storm of Swords, is as long as all three Lord of the Rings books put together.

And then DB Weiss and David Benioff entered the scene. D&D teamed up with Martin and HBO to create the only adaptation A Song of Ice and Fire could ever have. Game of Thrones. Since 2011 Game of Thrones has broke new ground in television, fantasy, and entertainment in general. The show brings superb acting (including some absolutely peerless child actors), fantastic writing, and amazing cinematography, which, coupled with an appropriate respect for the source material, makes for an absolutely unequaled entertainment experience.

Game of Thrones is a show about honor and betrayal, brutality and heroism, intense characterization, all sprinkled throughout with sword fights, dragons, rebellions, executions, dragons, ice zombies, and lots and lots of nudity.

One warning I should give the wary adventurer before embarking on a quest to Westeros, this is not a journey for the faint of heart. Game of Thrones will kick your ass, break your heart, and possibly give you a nervous twitch when attending weddings. If you have the mental fortitude however, the rewards are well worth it. Game of Thrones is an enriching experience that has been raising the bar for four years now.

As far as this set goes, if you're new to Game of Thrones then it's a great way to get the whole series (as of February 2015) in one package. If you've been collecting the series all along though, this doesn't really have much to make the price tag worth a second dip. If you've been buying the box sets as each season comes out and want a full set, save your money and do it when the show is done and they release a complete series box set.",1424476800,59,2295,4.615196078431373

5864962,4,B00DY64CR4,"Game of Thrones! Although my opinion of the HBO Original Series has deteriorated as a result of reading Martin's original works, this still stands well above typical television. While not perfect, and lacking in sense in certain regards, the show provides a fantastic dichotomy of lead characters whose personalities are well established in their respective introductions. What is great about these characters is what happen when they meet and clash, more than the show being about Team Targaryen vs. Team Lannister vs Team Stark, etc. the show is about how the individual characters interact with each other often resulting in a mixture of feelings with the audience when two characters they greatly adore hate each other to death. A great series & here's hoping season 6 turns out better than season 5.",1460764800,,804,5.098484848484849

5865258,4,B00DY64CR4,"""Game of Thrones"" has stunning, wondrous panoramas; immaculate, vivid sets; strong, empathetic characters; and astounding special effects. Yet the disorganized, incoherent story arc left me disillusioned and dissatisfied.

George R.R. Martin is notorious for writing 1,500-page books. In the first one, ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" the characters of Westeros aimlessly (and listlessly) wander the highly-imaginative kingdom.

For example, after his father is beheaded, the crippled Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and his entourage search for the three-eyed raven, which he sees in his dreams, for THREE seasons. [He eventually meets the ""Child of the Forest"" who leads him to the raven.] Meanwhile, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) and her protector ""Hound"" stroll to and fro without purpose. At Season 4's end, she finally boards a ship bound for Braavos to train with the Faceless Men, a group of anonymous street assassins.

The HBO series is inundated with random and preposterous, violent plot twists including the slaughtering of the Council of 13; Ygritte (Rose Leslie) shooting three arrows into her beloved Jon Snow (Kit Harington); Snow later killing Ygritte; and the Night's Watchmen stabbing Snow to death by Season 5's end.

The show is beset with too much impertinent banter with a slow & dulling pacemaking the viewer wait for something significant to happen. Apparently, succinctness of prose; a purposeful plot; and a vigorous story momentum are not a priority for screenwriters David Benioff & D.B. Weiss.

Despite its flaws, ""Game of Thrones"" is still worthwhile to watch. This epic fantasy is great, but its powerful and compelling female cast, especially Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), gives it greatness. The multi-faceted, strong female supporting characters are the glue that keeps the show bonded whereas the male characters only serve as medieval archetypes. The exception being Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage)  a brilliant, versatile actor who brings a Shakespearean bravado and wry perspective to his role.

The Achilles heel of the fantasy saga is a lax approach to editingthe reluctance to cut unnecessary dialog and to snip trivial situations. Plus, Benioff & Weiss want to stretch out the series to the outer borders of Essos, but the show needs to wrap up soon lest it lose its mystique and allure.

Amazingly, Martin is still working on ""The Winds of Winter,"" the sixth book in the anthology, so how are the screenwriters expected to create continuity of character development and story progression?",1447113600,,2538,5.35929648241206

5865287,5,B00DY64CR4,A great way to power watch the first four seasons. I had never seen GOT as I don't subscribe to HBO. I had heard good things about the series so I jumped in with both feet to try the series. This is a great set and includes some interesting extras to explain the complexity of the world of GOT. For those who haven't every watched GOT -- be warned to take the TV-MA rating seriously. Not for kids!,1443916800,5,397,4.102564102564102
5865288,1,B00DY64CR4,"I finished the first season, and I felt asleep during each episode. This is boring beyond comprehension. Watching the golf channel is more entertaining than this --- just watching the grass grow provides a far more eventful viewing experience. This show should be renamed ""The Lord of the Rings with Breasts,"" as it seems devised mostly to titillate teenage boys with casual nudity here and there. If you are a mature adult, have a job and a partner/spouse, and can afford your own living quarters (as opposed to your mother's basement), stay away from this bore. Watch shows for adults instead: Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Veep, etc.",1443744000,,643,4.908256880733945

8598941,5,B00DY64CR4,"When I first saw ads for Game of Thrones I immediately was super turned off and was sure it was ultra stupid and knew it sucked.  Somehow I wound up watching about 5 minutes of an episode and was instantly hooked.  I've since bought every season.  Every single episode/season is the bomb.  Best TV movie ever made.  Super engaging plots, music, interior and exterior settings, color, characters, suspense, eroticism and everything else are top of the heap.  I've bought entire seasons and watched 2-3 episodes a night.  Can't begin to recommend it highly enough.  I can't believe that  Season 8 isn't going to be aired until next year.  When I heard it was going to be aired this summer I got freaked out wondering how I could wait an entire year without seeing a new season.  Recently learned that it won't come out until next year (2019) and that it will only have 6 episodes.  What an immense bummer.  But I'm sure it will be more than worth it.  I'm in love with Queen Daenerys and won't be able to stand it if anything bad happens to her.",1529107200,,1043,4.4787234042553195
