8447864,1,B0001LQJVM,I purchased one of these DVDs and watched it once.  I put it on a shelf for a couple of years and when I tried to play it again it wouldn't work.  I contacted the author about obtaining a replacement disc.  He asked for a small amount and I agreed to pay it.  After that he never answered my emails again.  His poor materials are only matched by his worse customer service.  Stay away!!!,1249257600,,387,4.162162162162162
8447865,1,B0001LQJVM,"If you are looking for a DVD to learn 'How to do documentaries', you are going to be very disappointed, as I was.

I bought this DVD based on the information and the opinion of someone else who rated this item. Maybe the rating is accurate for himself, but there is little or no information about making documentaries. It is a simple, and in my opinion not very interesting, story of what Mr. Hoffman had made during his life. Some documentaries in the 60's and 70's about singers, and many commercials for big corporations from 80's.

No advice on how to do anything related to serious documentary filmmaking, no comments on how to improve your skills. Just short excerpts from his old documentaries.

If you a fan of Mr Hoffman, buy it. But if you want information on how to do your documentary, look somewhere else.",1168041600,6,818,4.589041095890411
8447866,4,B0001LQJVM,"I was trying to find a film that would be personal and show me how people go about making documentaries because I never went to film school, but I am trying to find my way in the industry. I thought it was very helpful, and fun to watch. I feel like I learned a lot from Mr. Hoffman.",1140393600,2,283,3.896551724137931
