7864508,4,630417182X,A nice low budget action flick.,1411689600,,31,4.333333333333333
7864509,3,630417182X,"Gary Daniels and PM Entertainment (a partnership between low budget directors Joseph Merhi and Richard Pepin) had a good thing going together in the mid-90s. When looking looking at films like ""Rage"" and this film, ""Riot"", it seems like they were hitting on all cylinders and giving their marginal fan base exactly what they wanted: take-no-names butt kicking and--maybe--a little story to string it all together.

In this one, the plot is basically a mix of ""The Warriors"", ""Escape from New York"", and whatever buddy cop movie you'd prefer. Gary teams with Sugar Ray Leonard, though the latter makes his exit far too early for this to be a true buddy movie. The highlight of the film is an early brawl with Gary and Ray whipping up on anyone that dares get near them.

And that's what this movie has going for it: there's lots of fighting; every confrontation seems to devolve into who can kick who's hiney into the next county. This movie's not smart of exceptionally good, yet it's worth a look because who doesn't want to see Gary kick people's jaws across the screen?",1406419200,,1072,4.7272727272727275
7864510,4,630417182X,"""Riot"" is a vehicle for Gary Daniels from the heyday of his career as an action movie regular. Chronologically wedged between the superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Tiger/dp/B0009ETCZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Tiger</a>&nbsp;and the dreadful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocket-Ninjas/dp/B0001WTVK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocket Ninjas</a>, it has a good chance of getting overlooked by casual viewers, which is a shame because it's a pretty decent flick for action junkies like me. It's far from perfect, doing a number of things wrong that would make me rate it more accurately as 3.5 stars if I could, but it nevertheless remains near the top of the heap if you're selecting a movie of Gary's ample filmography to buy.

The story: when a mass riot erupts in an urban neighborhood following the police shooting of three youths, several city blocks become an unregulated war zone and the daughter of a British senator (Paige Rowland,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doomsdayer/dp/B00005NRNN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doomsdayer</a>) is kidnaped during the fray by a dangerous gang. SAS operative Shane Alcott (Daniels) is dispatched to save her, and in the process discovers that the kidnapping is part of a much larger and more ominous scheme.

At the time the movie was being filmed, the infamous LA riots had occurred less than five years ago, and while the parallel was probably unintentional, it is sort of uncomfortable to see a Caucasian kickboxer like Daniels shooting and beating up many African-American opponents in an urban setting. Perhaps even the producers took notice of this, because at approximately the halfway point of the movie, the main villains switch from a black gang headed by Dex Sanders (""King of the Underground"") to an IRA cell headed by Patrick Kilpatrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Warrant/dp/B0000542CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Warrant</a>). This change is so abrupt it almost feels like a last-minute insertion, but in the end I don't mind, seeing as Kilpatrick makes a pretty entertaining bad guy when slinging an Irish accent.

Most of the casting is pretty good, actually. Though they're underutilized, the ensemble also includes Charles Napier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood-Part-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood, Part 2</a>) and Kenneth Tigar (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Heat/dp/B000BFH2RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Heat</a>) as Alcott's military allies, and Thom Barry (""Cold Case"") shows up surprisingly late in the picture to play a memorable side-role. The most significant casting, of course, is boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard as Gary Daniels' immediate onscreen partner. To date, this is the only major film role that Leonard has had during his acting career, and I applaud the teaming up of one of boxing's best with kickboxing's Hollywood representative. However, some of my gusto disappeared when it turned out that his character only partook in a single fight scene and (SPOILER) died when the movie was halfway over.

While I don't condone the latter matter, perhaps it wasn't a bad idea to limit Sugar Ray's fisticuffs, because no matter how good of a boxer he is in real life, his awkward punching is one of the low points of the otherwise solid action content. There are several explosions, some shootouts, and some eye-catching stunts (i.e. the mass motorcycle attack), but the highlights of the action are definitely the karate fights. There are only six, but it seems like more because as a rule, these are surprisingly lengthy brawls. The best happens early on, when Daniels and Leonard take on an entire baseball team in a bar, using lots of reversals and counter moves. It's a minor disappointment that Gary doesn't have any opponents to credibly go one-on-one with, but the one-against-many randori fights are nonetheless entertaining for the strength of their choreography and Gary's physical prowess.

Relatively strong production values continue to elevate the picture, making it a must-have for sincere fans of Daniels. If what I've described sounds acceptable to you, go ahead and give this one a buy. You can definitely do worse with Britain's Danger Man.",1377907200,,4465,6.080952380952381
7864511,5,630417182X,Gary Daniels and Suger Ray Leonard! What a duo and they kick some ass in this movie. Gary Daniels at his finest and Sugar Ray does a fine job too. The bar fight is awesome!,1355788800,,172,3.942857142857143

7864513,3,630417182X,Riot is a great movie that was desperately in need of some editing. Many of the characters in this movie were given far too much time considering that they were either about to die or not be seen again in the movie. The  fight scenes were great but much of the action had to be sacrificed to the  movies gloomy lighting which made a little under half the fighting a matter  of guessing what the heck happened. This movie tried to keep the fights  unique by using a fun sound track and some professional sounding scary  music. The real applause go to the action scenes like the one with the  helicopter (although the fire looked very fake it did look very cool) and  the parking lot scene where Gary Daniels runs from two cars trying to hit  him. This was a good movie for those willing to wait for the story to come  back in but I would prefer that it went into a little less detail of things  that didn't matter,967593600,,912,4.25
7864514,3,630417182X,"Riot was a good movie, a little thin on plot, but Gary Daniels as always delivers some increadable Martial Arts action.  Suger Ray Leonard was also in the flick and the Bar fight with the two was phenominal.  Definatley a  movie to watch if you like marital arts.",934243200,,263,4.4375
