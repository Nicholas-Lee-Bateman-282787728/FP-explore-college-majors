6156594,5,B00HEM9PW6,"I took a chance and won!  Yes, the trailer looked good but I can't believe what I just sat through.  Absolutely this movie will &#%* with your mind.  I just lived through everything with Tom & Lucy.  I actually feel nauseous, anxious and completely exhausted.  I've not ever been physically affected by a movie.  After about the first 20 minutes, it is non-stop edge of your seat, white knuckles until the credits roll - I kid you not.........Do yourself a huge favor and please please please don't miss this one.  I know it's a BUY but it is worth every penny of that purchase price without a doubt.

I gave IN FEAR 5 stars but would give it 10 if I could.",1393977600,3,657,4.327868852459017
6156595,5,B00HEM9PW6,"I have to confess that prior to receiving IN FEAR in the mail, I had not heard of the film.  This should not be surprising, I suppose, as I have been overly busy the past couple of months with the weather, the move, and everything else.  But Im very thankful the fine folks at Anchor Bay sent it to me.  This is one heck of a thrill ride, and every horror fan should check this one out!

If youve been driving for a while, Im sure youve found yourself in the middle of nowhere at least once.  In a rural area like where I live, there are plenty of places to get turned around.  As such, the feeling of being lost in a remote location can be very unsettling.  This film takes that sensation to an extreme!

IN FEAR is shot very well and looks excellent onscreen.  I have to tip my hat to the cinematographer, David Katznelson; he is obviously talented, and this film is a true testament to that talent.  In fact, the whole production team should be commended.  The film looks great and feels like a high-budget production.

Likewise, the cast does a great job as well.  Iain De Caestcker and Alice Englert play off of each other like theyve been friends for years.  And supporting cast member Allen Leech is creepy and devilish, the perfect antagonist for a piece like this.  All three give stellar performances and help to make this film a perfect ten.

There are plenty of thrills and chills here as well.  IN FEAR doesnt just prey on your sensesit feeds off of your fears, too.  And in doing so, it takes you on a roller coaster ride of horror.  You won't be the same after watching this film, I guarantee you that.

IN FEAR is a heck of a win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  Even if you're not a horror fan per se, its a slick and effective thriller that will keep you guessing.  The film hits store shelves next week, so be sure and make a note to check it out!!",1393977600,,1877,4.228169014084507
6156596,2,B00HEM9PW6,"i totally agree with Christopher Trout's Review..
i was looking forward to this movie! ive read so many good things about it, loved the trailer and the story and then finally watched it..
nice setting, nice score, nice actors.... aaaaand nothing is happening.. yes its only 86 minutes or something short..and still i got BORED! it took 50 out of 80 minutes that i finally felt something like a thrill.. yes the forest looked scary but seriously.. the tree in front of my house does too.. if i film it now in the night, do i get a 5 / 5 star rating for that?
so finally something starts to happen.. and its just nothing i was expecting..

SPOILER
just another bimbo creep guy who apparently lost his mind..
SPOILER END

cuz u don't get an explanation at all..which is okay with some movies..but with this one it just feels like someone had a cool idea about getting lost in the woods and needed an explanation for it.. its just so weak and random.. i expected way more..
couldnt believe my eyes when i suddenly saw the credits..

u gonna watch the movie?
dont expect ANYTHING, then u might be able to enjoy it a bit",1393977600,7,1114,4.398058252427185
6156597,2,B00HEM9PW6,"After I placed this in my cart to purchase, I was given the opportunity to see the film in High Definition...for free. In the words of Homer Simpson -

Thank you, Jebus!

I would probably give this 2 and  stars...but, due to the 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes...I feel the need to add some balance to those reviews.

Let me tell you the positives first. The film looks great in 1080p. It definitely ramps up the ""creep factor"" and this film nails it. Everything from the rain, desolate roads, the beautiful skies (day and night time) and the trees look like they are coming alive. As if they are reaching out and trying to engulf you at every second. Nicely done.

You see THIS is why I think every critic is bonkers about this movie. It delivers on atmosphere...which so, SO many of our pathetic entries these days fail to achieve. I could go on, but if you watch the movie, you'll see what I'm talking about.

Also, I really enjoyed the score. Music can do a lot for a movie and I found this movie's score to create tension and suspense when needed. Another coup for this film. If you are dying to hear another dumb, screeching metal band shredding their guitars and screaming incoherent lyrics over some chick getting hacked up...move along. Nothing to see here.

Now onto the movie...(heavy sigh).

We first meet up with Lucy sitting on a toilet in a restroom. She looks on the stall wall and someone has written something about ""if you hurt an innocent...karma is a killer and you'll get what you deserve"", to which Lucy writes ""or not"" after it. We then see a hole in the stall and an eye looking back at her.

Lucy then leaves and gets into the car with Tom (whom she's only dated for two weeks) and instead of meeting up with a bunch of friends camping, Tom surprises her with some hotel he booked to celebrate their two week anniversary. Lucy is hesitant, but agrees to go. This hotel is SO REMOTE, and SO FAR off the for beaten path, that some CREEPY SHUTTLE with a driver that won't show himself has to meet them at the bar and try and get them there. This is where all the nice scenery comes into play which turns terrifying as the movie goes along.

Lucy and Tom drive around and around, going in circles, not being able to find the hotel even though they are following all the signs. Also, it is getting later and later in the evening and now they don't even know how to get back to the main road. During this drive, Lucy asks Tom -

""What happened at the bar?""

I guess this is an important factor because it comes up again...when Max shows up all bloody, jumps in their car and tells them that someone is chasing him.

Now...with only three people in the movie, do you think Max is ""good"" or ""bad""?

Take your time.

In risk of ""spoilers"", I'll just add that it appears that spilling ""a pint"" on someone at a bar is something that you should NEVER, EVER do. Seriously, a rather large portion of this movie revolves around this point. You see, Tom states that someone spilled ""a pint"" on him and to not cause a scene he purchased everyone a drink; however, Max says that it was Tom who spilled ""a pint"" on someone and was a jerk about it. Oh, those college kids. This causes...okay, I just can't hold back any longer.

SPOILER TIME!

I'm assuming Max was at the bar and probably the one spying though the hole at Lucy. He's a wacko and enjoys changing all the signs to the hotel to get people like Tom & Lucy lost. It's a game to him...and now Tom & Lucy have to play it. Max grabs Lucy and asks her who would she rather see die...Tom or herself. He says he has a knife and she has to choose. At the last minute she yells out Tom's name. Now, Tom would probably rather hear his name being yelled out in the bedroom...but, this is not that film. Sucks to be Tom.

Max doesn't have a knife (surprise), laughs and gets out of the car.

Now, what would YOU DO? If your answer is ""grab a bottle of tequila and go running, blindly after Mad Max and fight him to the death"" you deserve a shot of that tequila. After things go badly for Tom (he's not getting the one-up on Max), Max goes over and picks up the top of the shattered glass tequila bottle and hands it over to Tom to do him in. If you think this is when Tom locates his brain...please put DOWN that shot of tequila. Tom goes in for the kill and well...Max isn't having any of it.

I won't spoil what happens next...but, it's shrug worthy.

So, now Lucy is back in the car and after driving around she FINALLY finds the hotel which OF COURSE is a rundown shell of it's former self with stacks and stacks of cars of what I'm assuming are the fates of other poor patrons who have accidently spilled ""a pint"" on someone down at the local bar.

This all accumulates with Lucy finding her way back to the main road...with Mad Max standing in front of her beckoning her to finish what they started. What is she to do? Well, I'll tell you, she guns it and then -

CREDITS.

YeeeAAAHHH...oh, that hurts. Honest to God...end credits. Great. The movie was 82 minutes long and remember, I loved the atmosphere and I loved the film score...and, I still ended up looking at my watch three times. I would also like to mention that I thought the acting was fine too. EXCEPT...for one tiny, small blunder on the filmmakers part. You just don't give a crap if ANY of them live or die. Call me crazy (or just Max), but I always find that to be a deal breaker and critical blow to any movie.

And to think of all those people who hated After Dark's Penny Dreadful.

I can certainly understand why some people like this movie.  Unfortunately, for me, it just didn't give me enough reasons to care. For example, if Max had told Lucy ""You've only known Tom for two weeks, huh? Sooo...you really DON'T know him then, do you?"" it would of least created in one's mind what or who this Tom character was all about.

Frankly, for the first half of the film, Tom was creepy enough with this whole hotel thing that I thought he was in on it. Then characters keep bringing up the bar incident, so now you're waiting for this big reveal...and nothing. Well, outside of a spilled drink - nothing. Huh?

Also, while Lucy makes some decisions that seem harsh (i.e. not going back to help someone; choosing Tom to die) remember, she only knew this guy for a couple of weeks. She gets a pass on that one. However, it certainly doesn't make for a sympathetic character and/or one to root for.

On top of everything else...why is this abandoned, nearly torn down hotel used as a muse to get unexpected people out there? Nothing is ever explained regarding the hotel - AND YET - we see a ton a cars that look like they've all encountered the same fate. This hotel has some history and I wanted to know it.

I love a slow burn and I don't like everything spoon fed to me either. I also don't like every review coming in praising this film like it's the next evolution in horror. Check, please.

If you get the chance to see this for free...I would. It's nice to see a movie that truly gets the tone and feel of a horror film done right. Would I pay $25.49 plus tax to own it?

6156600,4,B00HEM9PW6,"This is one of my favorite Irish horror films - if you enjoy more psychological horror than slasher/blood and gore, etc... I finally ended up buying it today, after having rented it three times. The film tells the tale of two ""lost"" vacationers searching for their hotel amidst what amounts to a maze in the Irish countryside. I think this film provides an excellent example of a great slow build that never lets up, and combines numerous elements of horror to good effect. The maze...the mystery of the ""lost"" hotel...the mystery men hunting them...a young man trying to protect himself and his partner... outstanding.

6156611,3,B00HEM9PW6,"I thought the movie "" In Fear"" was scary. Like creepy scary. But the last 20min were not scary and that kind of took the scared effect away. But it is hard to find a decent horror flick so I would recommend this one. You can't compare it to your average movie but if you just want a good scared feeling this is it. I was home alone while watching in the pitch dark. Not sure if I want to go to Ireland now. And I don't regret that it wasn't amazon prime so I actually had to rent it.",1410566400,,483,3.84
6156612,1,B00HEM9PW6,"Usually if someone gives horror movies bad reviews then they usually are not horror movie fans in general so I never listen to them and form my own opinion but in this case I wish I had listened. This is another case of a great trailer that misleads the viewer big time. A guy and his girlfriend of two weeks decide to go to a music festival with friends, but decide to go a day early and stay overnight at some hotel in the middle of the country...so far so good as I was buying this premise but after the first 10 minutes the movie gets really bad and never recovers!

The come to the end of the road and there is a locked gate that has the hotels name on it.  Okay this is where it gets so unbelievable the gate is locked with thick chain around it and nowhere else to go and the boyfriend gets out and pulls the chain out, unlocks it and drives through ?  HUH ?  Yes really.... then the spend what seems like an eternity of the movie driving around in circles in the woods looking for this hotel all the while they are in a maze, can't find the hotel or the way out and suddenly a mad man appears and worst plot lines in horror history start.  I am telling you I have seen it all and this movie with the twisty creepy roads and the dark forest could have kinda saved some of the story, but no... bad acting, and bad writing and bad dialogue destroy what little originality there was.",1410220800,,1387,4.1033210332103325

6156614,5,B00HEM9PW6,"I genuinely love this film. Unlike most horror films from the last fifteen years, In Fear actually manages to be intense from beginning to end. The resigning behind whats going on in the story isn't really explained or brought to fruition, but I think thats scarier/creepier in a weird way. It kind of leaves it up to you, yes YOU to interpret whats going on.
Overall the music is great, the cinematography is really good, the atmospher is perfect, and the acting is also great.

6156615,1,B00HEM9PW6,"In fear was a another modern horror film that has been getting, overall, great reviews. I wanted to check it out based upon that as well as the fact that I liked the premise of the film. As usual, I am not going to go deep in the story/premise of the film here, but I will say that the film is based around the concept of travelers getting lost while traveling. The film started out well and held alot of atmosphere, however, about 3 quarters in it fell apart. I think the main problem was that it felt the need to beging trying to explain itself. Many great horror films make this mistake, ""Them"" for example. Overall, I would say this film is a step above other recent outings such as Resolution and Kill List (everybody loves this stinker). However, there are many other films out there right now you should be checking out instead; (Absentia) for example. Overall, this film will leave you frustrated at the end and wishing they had went in another direction instead of the (SPOILER) ""pick up a stranger and he tries to kill us"" plot"".",1406160000,,1039,4.445026178010472

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So something happened at a pub.  Want to know what happened?  Sorry, we never find out.  Then we have our two main characters, Tom and Lucy driving around the countryside looking for a hotel they have reservations at.  They are being chased and tormented by some unnamed psycho that is moving signs around to keep them lost.

Then they pick up some wounded guy named Max, and right away I knew this guy wasn't on the up and up.  His forehead is cut and he is bleeding like crazy and insisting that he was attacked.  Later we find out that he was the guy who was doing everything.

Okay so how did he manage to get ahead of them and switch the signs around every time they came up at a crossroads?  Was he teleporting around the woods?  Also how did he manage to cut this tree down without them hearing it?  Did he have a chainsaw that was completely silent?  Plus what happened to Tom?  He just left the car and suddenly he was gone with no explanation of what happened to him.

Then Lucy is back in the car and finally finds the hotel theyve been trying to find.  Turns out it is completely run down and has broken down cars everywhere around it that shows us that this Max guy has been doing this for a LOOOOONNNNG time to unsuspecting travelers.  Why cant we know about that!?!  That sounds much more interesting than following these two boring characters around!  Id love to know Maxs story and about this run down hotel!

And the ending?  Lucy manages to find the main road again.  How did she do this?  Sorry, we never find out.  Then she sees that Max is in the middle of the road and taunting her to hit him.  She guns the engine and races towards him and just as she is about to hit him, we cut to black and the credits roll.

Really!?!  You pulled a Sopranos on us!?!  We don't even get to see if she actually hit him or if it was a trap!?!  What a gyp!

The story was just lame and uninteresting.  The whole time I was playing with my dog, checking my phone and surfing the web.  The story wasn't engaging at all and was just boring.  The only good thing about the movie was the soundtrack.  The music was actually good and helped to build atmosphere, but the story failed to deliver and music can only do so much to carry a movie.

Most of this low budget foreign yarns action takes place in the car.  There is a degree of tension that diminishes when the true plot is revealed.  On the included production extra we learn that actors didn't follow a script, and didn't know what was coming.  The director was going for realism and acheives it, but at the expense of a believable story.  Worth a Redbox $1.20, but that's all.",1400457600,,522,4.442105263157894

Almost immediately I felt a creepy vibe with this movie, and it remained creepy and suspenseful throughout. This was the main plus. So many horror movies these days claim to be ""horror"" while in reality they are comedies with a ""horror""-ish theme. This was not. However, despite the building suspense of the movie, no real climactic ending ensued. There were many things left unexplained, and I felt it could have gone much farther into the darkness than it did. This is why I did not give it 5 stars even though I did thoroughly enjoy it. It could have been better, true, but I think it was on the right track for horror, a thing I sorely miss these days.",1400284800,2,757,4.492753623188406

The 'force' in the synopsis led me to expect a supernatural flick. Its not that. The beginning took a little too long in my book to get kicking. They could've shortened the driving in circles part. But by the time the action kicked off, once they pick up the guy, the pace is steady and tension is sustained well throughout. I personally liked the ending, as it allowed me to use my imagination. I would've been disappointed if an ending I didn't like was foisted upon me. I personally chose the ending based on the story the guy in the car told about someone who stood in the middle of the road to see what happened, and the driver swerved and was killed instantly.

6156637,2,B00HEM9PW6,"In Fear's director, Jeremy Lovering, aspired to shoot In Fear in a David O. Russell fashion where the actors improvised every scene.  While it is hard to know whether we can attribute the poor result to that style of shooting, In Fear's meandering second and third acts fail to build tension.

Probably the film's biggest pitfall is its central antagonist.  Basically he is far too normal and charismatic seeming to be scary.  It seems like Lovering was going for a kind of Fatal Attraction set up, where the person who seems normal sort of rips off their mask, and reveals a seriously disturbing streak of sadism.

The villain here rips off A mask, but he never fully transforms into the monster this kind of film requires.  At worst he seems.. judgemental, and often he just seems like a pedestrian hooligan prankster.  He isn't crazy enough to be taken as slasher type killer, but he isn't developed to be a more grounded villain either.  There is only one scene where he is actually physically violent, and he demonstrates a weird ability to overpower the other characters which is more confusing than frightening (he isn't particularly big or muscular looking).

The film has a couple bits of creepy scenery, which paint a rural 'lawless' backwoods town.  We see all dirt roads, raw old wooden deserted shacks, ominous scarecrows in the distance, lots of forestry obscuring the immediate surroundings.  But again, with no legitimate strife placed on our protagonists (outside of an inability to navigate, and the cliche loss of cell/satellite-GPS signal) it is sort of like the Irish Chainsaw Massacre.... but without the Chainsaw and Masacre parts.

Unfortunately this is film trying to put a spin on the genre, that can't seem to escape its most rote tropes or adapt them in a logical entertaining way.  It sets up the protagonists' basic predicament well, but then it repeats that set up over and over again, instead of actually developing a more meaningful conflict.  We can't root for anyone, we can't be mortified.  We just kind of scratch our heads and yawn.

While sort of an interesting film experiment, In Fear is ultimately a failed one.",1397520000,,2153,4.889807162534435

6156656,3,B00HEM9PW6,"Sundance Film Festival selection ""In Fear"" was released on Blu-ray and DVD recently. Although it's easy to see why the film was chosen to be showcased at the event, it still doesn't quite measure up and falls short of taking home any awards. While it does its job by putting audiences in the grip of fear and tension, you're still left feeling much like the tormented couple lost while driving through the woods. I begged the question, ""Where is this going?"" as I couldn't shake the sensation of going around in circles and not getting anywhere.

Tom and Lucy have known each other for two weeks. Wanting to get acquainted with each other, they embark on a road trip to a music festival in Ireland. The two decide to stay at an out-of-the-way hotel for a romantic evening alone before meeting up with their friends. After being led out into the middle of nowhere, they discover they've been the victims of someone's sick and deranged plans to torture and stalk them.

""In Fear"" does a great job putting to use its Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound mix. You'll feel like you're enveloped by the woods and being swallowed by all the noises and sinister quiet the film uses to keep viewers constantly on the edge of their seats. The crew that handled the sound editing for this movie deserves a huge pat on the back.

The movie is given a widescreen presentation (2:35.1). Much of ""In Fear"" takes place at night and Director /Writer Jeremy Lovering uses the darkness to his advantage. The picture quality is still clean and clear, but only reveals what he wants the audience to see.

One special feature is found on the Blu-ray for ""In Fear."" A featurette entitled ""'In Fear:' Behind the Scenes"" digs a bit below the surface and explores the making of the movie. There are interviews with the cast and crew and footage of the production. Director/Writer Jeremy Lovering also discusses what he was trying to accomplish and say with the film.

""In Fear"" is rated R for some disturbing violent content and terror, and language. There are really no adult situations or nudity involved. Tom and Lucy kiss at one point and that's it. Things definitely get very tense at times and you're left sympathizing with the couple as they suffer through one frightening ordeal after the next.

Although it's far from perfect, ""In Fear"" does what its creator wanted it to. It strikes fear and anxiety in the hearts of the viewing audience. There's no way you can watch it without experiencing some level of stress or panic.

The problem isn't really with the establishment of the atmosphere ""In Fear"" exudes. What it's missing is any sense of bearing or end goal. We're given a series of tragic and formidable events spread out through 85 minutes with no sort of plausible course trajectory or satisfying motive for the torment being brought down on them.",1394755200,2,2833,4.711111111111111

6156661,4,B00HEM9PW6,"Driving to a music festival in Ireland, new couple Lucy and Tom lose their way on complex, winding country roads while in search of a hotel.  Their frustration turns to desperation and fear when they are then set upon by a cruel and mysterious evil.  For the first hour, I believe In Fear (a brief and apt title) is a genre masterpiece or close to it.  I am an avowed fan of films trusting in the power of the audience's imagination, teasing and firing it with a subtle visual clue here, an unusual sound there.  Lucy and Tom's day trip turned nightmare becomes a source of almost unprecedented suspense, and no element (such as the car itself, at once a space of imagined safety and genuine claustrophobia) goes underutilized.  The film's unusual production, in which the cast were often unaware how a scenario would end or what lay in wait around the next turn, leaves no visible trace beyond the more-authentic-than-usual displays of anxiety put forth by the gifted leads:  Iain De Caestecker and Alice Englert (the fetching daughter of beloved New Zealand director Jane Campion).

Alas, every film must end, and this is where In Fear loses its way to a certain extent.  It is, to be honest, not an unexpected problem:  after unfolding as an exercise in direct, elegant, no-bull atmosphere and menace for an hour, the final 20 or so minutes are burdened with explanation, revelation, and a more direct form of conflict.  There is still a fair share of excitement within the climax, but one's mind turns to the concrete and quantifiable, such as the question of logistics and motivations, and the vast sense of unease cannot help but be undermined once given literal shape.",1394582400,3,1675,4.764705882352941
6156662,3,B00HEM9PW6,"This is yet another low budget, British horror and yes I am a bit of a fan. It tells the story of a couple who have only been together for two weeks but decide to go to a music festival together in Ireland. Once in the Emerald Isle Tom announces to Lucy that he has a wee bit of a surprise; that instead of heading off to a muddy field for the first night, he has booked them into a luxury hotel which he found on the inter web.

This entails following a Land Rover to the destination as it is a bit remote. Well it only takes them part way and then they are told to follow the signs. The problem is that they seem to be going in circles and appear to be lost. The fuel starts to drop as they endlessly try to get back to the main road or the hotel. Then night closes in and as darkness engulfs them so do their options get less easy to see. What follows will give all concerned a night to remember for all the wrong reasons.

Now this received a very wide variance of reactions on its release. It is one of those that has either been loved or at least `liked' or downright hated. One of the issues is it is mostly filmed in the beleaguered car; so we are heavily reliant on the couple for emotional build up to get the fright fest we all want. Some have said they could not see the point and there was no `plot'; well if you blink at the right time you will miss the whole point of what is to come, so I can sympathise with those who have expressed such concerns. The action when it comes seems stilted though and there are a lot of actions that are questionable. The sort of things that people only ever do in horror films, you know go into the dark scary room with no light etc.

Overall it managed to hold my attention right up until the end (it is only 85 minutes long) and it had some very scary moments which worked really well, the cinematography is very good given the limited scope and the scenery looks great. It was actually filmed in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall and not Ireland but it had me fooled. It is on the whole a reasonable effort that I would give 6.5 out of ten hence my star rating. The lessons I will take from this film are always drive straight to a festival and if you are going to book into a hotel give Trip Advisor a go first.",1394582400,2,2251,4.042600896860987
6156663,1,B00HEM9PW6,"In Fear features a good trailer and glowing reviews, in particular its Sundance selection.  I always get kind of geeked when horror films receive a Sundance film selection, as I tend to think ""average"" movie goers like you and I enjoyed the film.  Well, I don't want to say the glowing reviews are misplaced...but I think the glowing reviews are misplaced.

In Fear commits three cardinal sins for horror films.  That's three too many.  First, there's a very, very unlikable lead character.  The character of Tom is so perfectly hatable, I didn't particularly care what happened to him during this film.  Even his co-main character, Lucy, doesn't seem to care what happens to him, although to Lucy's credit she is kind of likable, but isn't really given much to do until the third act of the movie.

Second, as C. Sawin before mentioned, it isn't long before the movie handcuffs itself into not giving the characters many options for success.  Everything that can go wrong for them, does.  So, then why make everything so predictable?  Nothing ruins potential tension like predictable tension does.  The GPS loses reception.  The phones lose reception.  The car's gonna run out of gas at some point. And there's no clues or any kind of logic to what's happening to these characters in the film.  Which brings me to:

Third, the movie makes no sense.  At first, it's hinted that because Tom spilled a pint of beer on a guy's shirt, he's got his whole mob of flunkies out to get revenge.  So, was this all about a pint of spilled beer?  No, as it turns out, it was all one lunatic guy who likes to put on a big production for all his quarries of kills.  But then, why go to the big production?  How can he constantly flip all the signs by himself?  How can he be everywhere at once?  Does he have teleportation skills?  And why not just kill these two quickly so he can move on?  Is it because he's enjoying himself too much or does he just want to do what he can to push the runtime to an hour and a half?  These questions and more needed answering, but it's wishful thinking to hope for an explanation.

Speaking of padding runtime, a good drinking game you could play with your buddies is count how many times the camera either cuts to a closeup of the characters' eyes or cuts to showing the road.  Most of the film is just the car driving; in fact, there's more car driving here than in the Fast and Furious films.  But it's about as exciting of a drive as the family from Manos: The Hands of Fate driving to the Valley Lodge.  And that drive was a lot shorter.

Alas, the movie can't make up for its suckiness by providing boobs, gore or hilarious one-liners, rendering this a complete dud.",1394496000,10,2694,4.481481481481482

8631938,4,B00HEM9PW6,Surprised by the negative reviews. Thought it was creepy and jumpy. It's one of those slow moving ones that mess with your head. I liked it.,1435276800,,140,4.423076923076923
8631939,3,B00HEM9PW6,"Lovering has made a tense little chiller on a shoestring budget and that's to be applauded. The relatively unknown cast perform very well and the direction and cinematography are, for the most part, up to the job. It's not entirely successful however. The characters are not fleshed out enough for us to truly sympathise with them and the plot is too scant to give weight to the film. Thus, despite the ratcheting tension, the movie ultimately falls a little flat. But this is a fairly effective exercise in mounting menace and is a promising debut.",1431993600,,549,4.7894736842105265
