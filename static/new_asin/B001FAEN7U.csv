Unfortunately we cannot find this item in Brazil. This DVD is Region 0, so we can purchase it at Amazon.com and review always Euro 2008 best moments.

8301407,4,B001FAEN7U,"USUALLY, these official football/futbol review products(VHS/DVD) are PURE TRIPE (my apologies to the haggis loving public out there). I know this to be a fact as I own most of them. EURO 2008 was a FABULOUS tournament and as another reviewer stated ""I was anxiously awaiting the DVD covering the matches to become available"".

I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!! This disc goes over all group play and DOES NOT start the scene with the ball entering the net, showing no play build-up as is typical of most earlier products. As I watched every Turkie match on live TV (I won't need any adrenaline/testosterone shots for a year) I was very pleased with the match highlights and goals presented on this DVD.",1249171200,,693,4.775
8301408,5,B001FAEN7U,"I waited a year for this DVD to be released, and it was worth the wait.  In addition to all the goals of the Euro 2008, a few highlights from each match are also included.  The picture quality is quite good, and the commentary is well-informed and enthusiastic.  And, thankfully, no music!  The pre-game fan celebrations, however, can be annoying to some.  Unlike Reedswain's World Cup DVD (where group play is a single chapter), this DVD allows you to skip to the games of the next group.

My copy of the DVD does have a defect, though: It freezes at the beginning of the Greece-Spain game, and resumes at the beginning of the next chapter.  Naturally, I asked Amazon for a replacement.  As always, they dutifully obliged.  But, to my surprise, the replacement DVD had the exact same defect!  I've contacted Reedswain, and will update this review after they've had sufficient time to respond.

In short, I highly recommend this DVD to fans of European soccer; in particular, to those who admired Turkey's miraculous performance.

UPDATE:  After two weeks there's still no response from Reedswain.  Not surprising, though; I'm sure they're not too eager to acknowledge a widespread problem that might prove costly.",1242950400,3,1214,4.916256157635468
8301409,5,B001FAEN7U,"After years of frustration and futility, Spain under Luis Aragones (La Seleccin) found a way through in a truly entertaining Euro 2008.  This DVD takes you through all the twists and turns, including the Dutch orange crush of World Cup finalists Italy and France, the improbable comebacks of a plucky Turkey, and the ""piece de la resistance,"" the fine little chip of Spain's golden boy, Fernando Torres, which sealed the victory for La Furia Roja.  Each group stage is represented with the usual intervals of colorful, inebriated supporters (and the inevitable fanaticas guapas).  The excitement does not flag in the knock-out rounds, and the defiance of tactical conservatism is heartening (Italy rightly gets punished for its defensive cynacism, for pulling the shutters and locking the door).  If you watched the tournament live, this is a reminder of a scintillating summer.  For those too busy with work - or some other poxy pursuit - here's a chance to  catch what you missed.  Viva Espaa, viva ticky-tacka y el ftbol bonito.",1232150400,2,1031,5.06508875739645
8301410,5,B001FAEN7U,"Beautifully done DVD. If you're a soccer fan, and you followed Spain's trip to the trophy, then you won't be disappointed. Almost 3 hours in length - it shows highlights and every goal from EVERY game in the tournament. Great narration. A must-have for your collection. Viva Espana!",1225324800,,282,4.895833333333333
