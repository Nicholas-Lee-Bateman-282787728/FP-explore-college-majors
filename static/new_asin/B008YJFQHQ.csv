8532557,5,B008YJFQHQ,"2011 concert seems rather ""stiff"", but the 2012 concert can't be beaten. Hyun Joong seems more relaxed and enjoying it. He can never give a disappointing performance though.",1381536000,2,173,5.214285714285714
8532558,4,B008YJFQHQ,"I'm a huge fan of this Korean star. Have followed his career since his SS501 days, so I was happy that his latest tour was made available on DVD and will play on US DVD players. However, I can't give it 5 stars since a big part of the DVD is an interview which does not come with English subtitles. So, although the concert portion spotlighting his singing and dancing is amazing, it was disappointing not knowing what was being said during the interview. I knew the DVD was only in Korean and Japanese but I didn't realize how long the interview portion would be... I don't understand why they would make it for US DVD players but not bother to put English subtitles on it. That's not the artist's fault though and I thoroughly enjoyed the concert portion as expected!",1354579200,10,769,4.460992907801418
