5880546,2,B00DZSWI4A,"I would definitely watch another and better edition of the potentially great idea behind the making of this film.
The talking heads in this film refer to a ubiquitous and powerful bogeyman by the interchangeable names of `'them, the state, the government, media, or big business'. Although presented in a non-offensive and well-modulated manner, the message itself is suspect without some high-level knowledge and critical thinking to distinguish it from conspiracy theory.

Big media is to blame for the most recent dulling of American Minds ..... and this loosely clothed theme is the main message. The film tries to weave a story from very diverse studies of relatively new sciences dating from 100 years ago to present-day. These subjects of study include psychiatry, brain function, popular journalism, state propaganda and older espionage and interrogation techniques using various theories and assumptions as loosely cobbled together as the films' own premises and inferences.

As it happens, I cannot help but agree that the state of mind that is reflected by the overwhelming majority of free TV shows, news shows in America,  and other private and public media, does seem to be the product of a central power with the evil intent to beat down the intellectual and critical capacities of watchers to that of dumb beasts. This is because of the uniform lack of common sense and inherent natural values in the `free TV' shows.  For instance, they all seem to subtly persuade watchers that every normal and honest American should be going to jail sooner or later, on the basis of any kind of accusation of unconformity with some nebulous correct way of thinking or petty law. There does seem to be concerted brainwashing going on; a common thread is that a police state is normal and good, and that it should punish its citizens for any deviancy of values or law alike. All disobedient citizens or criminals are terrorists. This thinking is akin to what we commonly expect from reactionary Taliban types, or North Korean  or Medieval mindsets.

I just hope, as does probably the film-makers, that the state of public media is not entirely due to simply the lack of education or intellectual capacity of those working in the industry.

I therefore optimistically laud the apparent good intentions of the film.
The problem with this film is it seems to be living proof of the success of an alleged agenda to cripple intellectual capacity ...... as the writers and speakers in the film have indeed failed to find any evidence or solid connections to either a group of long-lived shareholders wielding a monopolistic power over both the media and say, prison industries or profitable educational institutions ..... or a long-lived group of political power-holders that could hold such a conceptual ambition for enough time to achieve results. I would pay to see somebody make those kind of solid and logical connections!  It would be fine indeed to identify an evil central committee! To be fair, though, if the Nazis could do what they did with the permission of reasonable citizens, I guess so could any other nation that organised itself in a like manner. The film makes connections between various individuals or sometimes companies who form somewhat influential groups over the course of a couple of decades; but it does not trace any requisite direct relationship between all the groups necessary to achieve such an agenda.

In a manner that requires some correction, the film waffles around, presenting with no apparent distinction or sequence, speakers discussing both the universal human mental foibles that lead us down the dumbest path, and the nameless exterior evil organisation that is allegedly determined to do the same.

This would be more understandable if the topic of discussion was the criticism of some not-so-great religion or mentality ...... but the editors of this film chose to portray the individual thinkers  in the film as also supporting the idea that our minds are being intentionally controlled by unidentified outside commercial or political powers. Blaming advertising and economic strategies that work because they are geared to our nature is not the same thing as being invaded by alien forces or subjugated by an evil group of beings. This is hardly legitimate scientific inquiry, nor investigative journalism!! I suspect the film portrayal is not entirely fair to the speakers, but the film does obviously try to be balanced, fair, and wide-ranging. The film is really a discussion - not a fact-finding documentary of any kind, nor an investigative report.

The speakers all appear to understand history and human nature, and that there is sadly nothing unusual about a government trying to boost its economy or tax revenue via consumerism or war, or by using public spin (propaganda or advertising)  to get the most results and avoid open revolution at the same time. Although the USA was founded by a small group of individuals determined to avoid that type of government and outcome, I think human nature and lack of enough intellectual capacity or free time to exercise it, among the majority of its population and politicians, will lead to the same result it does everywhere else in the world since the dawn of time.

The problem is intellectual and mental on the scale of the individual, and structural on the scale of each distinct collective. The film could have hopefully presented solutions or proposals instead of trying to identify an outside bogeyman, like medieval thinkers might do. Accusing the witches or corporations/rulers is not brilliant without some form of convincing proof, even though a blood-letting usually makes some people feel briefly better.
Maybe any blame for this criticism should be simply attributed to editing a large work into a smaller presentation. There does seem to be a lack of real investigative work and lack of real-world know-how or knowledge of how power can work. The sense of direction and conclusions of the film are unclear. Unstated bias may muddy the waters for the viewer.

I would still recommend anyone view the film; it was a good preliminary effort at creating something noteworthy, and the concerns are all seriously legitimate, but unless someone commits himself to doing a better and more thorough job of it, the film itself is the sad reflection of a dumbed-down America.

I would watch another and better edition of the potentially great idea behind the making of this film.

PS ..... the quality and abundance of high-value, perceptive, insightful, and non-free TV shows and series in the past 10 years outnumbers the number of like-quality shows over the last 40 years or more ..... so there is a large un-rated, un-counted population of high intellectual capacity Americans finding their own way to better media via internet etc. and many have abandoned TV and AMerican news in favour of daily lashings of Al Jazeera English Live and BBC News or even Canadian News ...... after a taste of that - nobody goes back to the American news channels.",1376524800,10,7051,5.043814432989691

8599548,5,B00DZSWI4A,"This film will show you how propaganda & crowd manipulation brain washes people with subliminal messages.... such as...Are we controlled? If we ARE controlled, to what extent & by whom? What does it mean for humanity's future? State of Mind..The Psychology Of Control shows the enormous implications of these questions and deters most of us who must deal with the daily consequences of the answers. State of mind digs deeply into the sources to reveal that much of what we believe to be truth has been deception, deliberately implanted in our consciousness to erect a ""tyranny over the minds of men"". From cradle to grave, our parents, peers, Institutions & society inform our values & behaviors. But this process has been hijacked. State of mind examines the science that has evolved over generations to keep us firmly in place & maintain the status quo so that dictators, power brokers, & corporate puppeteers may profit from our ignorance & slavery. From the anvil of compulsory schooling to media & entertainment, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. State of mind delves into the abyss to bring to light the manipulation & shocking examples that reveal the true agendas at work. From the ancient roots of the control of human behavior to its maturity in the mind control experiments of intelligence agencies & other organs of manipulation, State of mind reveals a plan for the future that drives home the dreadful price of our ignorance. We are prepared for a new paradigm. Will we choose our own path, or have one selected for us? State of mind unveils the answers that may decide whether humankind will fulfill it's destiny or be forever shackled to its own creation. A must see film. Learn the truth today & you be the judge.",1499212800,,1766,4.8125

8599554,5,B00DZSWI4A,"This movie keeps you watching with interest the entire time. Unlike most documentaries against the state, this one provides useful knowledge for your self defense (a defense, i might add, that won't get you thrown in jail as violence). Many documentaries today aim for the scare mantras, but this one handles a somber subject with poise.

The writers of this film, Kevin Cole and Richard Grove, are production gods who generate awesomely useful documentaries over at Tragedy and Hope media magazine. Most of what you see with their name on it is going to be PACKED with facts.

The director, james lane, also created the documentary film ""A Noble Lie"", a film that handles OKC bombing better than any before it.

All in all, this is a fantastic crew and a quality production.",1400025600,11,775,4.81203007518797
8599555,3,B00DZSWI4A,"I think the content is excellent, but the producer's selection of a girl to be the primary narrator on the sound track made it impossible to understand half of what she was saying.  My hearing range is diminished over the years, but no problem understanding the men's voices there-in.

 Also, no closed-captions on my copy, which would have been huge.",1379116800,4,351,4.816666666666666
8599556,4,B00DZSWI4A,"This documentary is an excellent introduction for the average man or woman into the bizzare world of methods of mass manipulation used by government and the media.  In a simple and interesting way, through video clips and interviews with experts in psychiatry, as well as  social and political science, the film shows how the science of Social Engineering was created and how its shady tactics were then  implimented on society.  It is a frightening expose of how torture is used to break prisoners of war and psychiatric patients down into a state of complete mental wreckage, and how they are then rebuilt into ""Manchurian Candidates"" programmed to asassinate and/or commit mass murder.  The deliberate dumbing down of students  throughout their life of public school education is also explored in great detail.  I highly recomend this film to those who are willing to explore the dark side of authority...",1377043200,17,908,5.094594594594595
