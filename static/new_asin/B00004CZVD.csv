1340181,1,B00004CZVD,"Video came on UK format - so I'm going to have to travel to London and rent a DVD player if I want to watch it.  I think this littile ""tidbit"" of information was pretty important.....I thought it would be assumed that a US buyer of a video on a US website would want a format compatible with a US DVD player.  Guess I didn't ask the right questions before I bought.",1331424000,,365,4.055555555555555
1340182,5,B00004CZVD,"Thoroughly enjoyed this second time around, I remember watching it on the TV and always wanted to see it again, it is still brilliant, I can see me watching it again. So pleased it came out on DVD. Thanks Amazon for listing it in your collection of DVD titles.",1322179200,5,260,4.326530612244898
1340183,1,B00004CZVD,We had seen the movie several years before and lost our copy.  Unfortunately the copy we purchased must run a different type of DVD player and we were unable to watch it at all.  It ran at warp speed and that makes it a little difficult to see.,1296604800,,244,4.0625
1340184,5,B00004CZVD,"I SAW THIS MOVIE A LONG TIME AGO , NICOLE KIDMAN GAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF HER LIFETIME IN THIS PICTURE . I HAVE BEEN SEACHING FOR IT ALL OVER AND CANNOT FIND IT AVAILABLE . I DO HOPE THAT A RESERGENCE OF THE WONDERFUL MOVIE STARTS UP AGAIN .  IT IMPRINTED A LIFE LESSON IN MY MIND AND IT INGRAVED GREAT VALUE IN MY HEART.  FOR YOUNG TRAVELLERS IT IS A MUST SEE.  FOR FANS IT'S A TREASURE TO A COLLECTION.",1286582400,11,403,3.950617283950617
1340185,4,B00004CZVD,"""Bangkok Hilton"" is a story of how money and family links helped an innocent young woman got away from a death penalty in Thailand for being unknowingly used as a mull by an attractive seducer-professional drug-trafficker, and revenge over his crimes following.

Regrettably, not much changed since this warning work appeared in Australia ages ago.",1271462400,5,348,5.327272727272727
1340186,5,B00004CZVD,"Though dated this is an excellent.  Even though this is her first major film, you can see why Nicole Kidman became a star.",1221609600,,122,4.304347826086956
1340187,1,B00004CZVD,"A 273-minute mini-series is cut down here to just over 90 minutes. That gives a whole new meaning to ""edited."" Don't waste your money!",1220313600,,134,4.625
1340188,5,B00004CZVD,"Nicole Kidman is locked away in a Bangkok prison, and we are shown her torment, trials, and finally her escape. This is a great version of Bangkok Hilton, but it is the 93 minute long theatrical asian version with english audio. It has the same cover as pictured, but this is not the tv series version on dvd (which I believe is over 2 hrs). But if you are looking for a shorter version which still keeps the integrity of the story this is it. And this a good edition for UK and Australian media collectors who are looking for all versions this film.",1187049600,,550,4.298076923076923
7920260,5,B00004CZVD,"The same wonderful movie I saw so many years ago and tried for years to find a copy.  Sound and color quality was excellent. No bumps in the night.  A perfect copy.  I was also able to play it on my lap top and DVD, so I must already be set up for regions 1 and 2.  Thank you very much.  It was worth the price.",1504396800,,311,3.6515151515151514

7920265,5,B00004CZVD,I saw this as a kid in Romania when I was abouy six or seven and its poetic power remained embedded in me ever since. It is a wonder how powerfully you feel as part of the story as its happening to you. This is a must see for anyone into serious drama or masterpieces of television series,1399507200,,288,3.9827586206896552
7920266,5,B00004CZVD,I have always loved this film but it was difficult to find. Finally obtained a copy. Works great with the unlocking code we were able to find for our DVD player.,1381190400,,161,4.225806451612903

And it is important not to lose hope and never give up.  This movie have to see everybody!",1380067200,,194,4.105263157894737
7920268,4,B00004CZVD,An Aussie friend recommended this mini-series after we started watching the Americans.  Like the Americans this is a flashback to the 1980's except this is set in England and Thailand.  The series is a bit slow to start but if you hang in there it is worth the watching.,1368057600,,270,4.489795918367347
7920269,3,B00004CZVD,"This is a great film with some good acting for its time, its just a shame the quality of the DVD is not so good, warbling music and fuzzy picture.",1348531200,,146,3.9
