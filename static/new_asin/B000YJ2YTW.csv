8571695,3,B000YJ2YTW,"This is a video for small landscape plants, but only covers tree pruning for several minutes at the most.  Hugh also does not advocate selecting the right plant for the right space in the beginning, which is critical for avoiding unnecessary labor (pruning) later.  A little too general for experienced gardeners.",1299196800,2,313,5.117647058823529

As a landscape designer, I want to educate my clients on the value of proper pruning, but this can take hours! What better tool to have on hand? I can't think of one. Too often I have visited beautifully designed landscapes that were reduced to mediocrity through the lack of basic pruning skills.
Learn to extend the lifetime and beauty of your landscape. Hugh's friendly, down-to-earth guidelines really do make it as easy as ABC!",1197849600,3,593,5.123711340206185
