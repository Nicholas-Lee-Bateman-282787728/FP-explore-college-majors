1234790,4,B00000JMOU,"I picked up this VHs awhile ago on a CYF whim. The film had been critically hated, and bashed on most of the review sites I had seen. However the cover with chow yun fat in the long coat twirling in a  leonesque standoff on the front cover, I had to have it. It couldn't be  that bad...and it wasn't.
The problem with this film is it tries to hard  to show all sides of Chow Yun Fat's persona as a HK superstar, The film  goes from Heroic Bloodshed, to slapstick comedy, to Meladramatic touching  love story all in the span of two hours. I am a HUGE Chow Yun Fat fan, and  can consider myself somewhat of an authority, and even I in no way hated  this film!
Chow Yun Fat plays Ah Ching, an American CIA agent in HK who  is hired by the USA government to return a stolen national treasure from a  Shaolin Temple. The treasure turns out to be a sweet young woman gifted  with supernatural powers (why she is a national treasure is never really  explained). That being said, Chow Yun Fat falls in love with her, and  protects her from other Vengeful CIA agents who want to sell her to the  highest bidder.
What I didn't like about this film was some of the  comedy, some. I enjoyed most of it, which is very unusual for me becuase I  am not a fan of most Hk comedy. But it is just too funny. From Chow's  interaction with the Shaolin Monks, to the Foul Mouthed Cabbie who used to  be a Shaolin Master, to the fat little monk named ""priestling  grasshopper"", no matter how many times i watch it, it is still  funny.
The film is also a very touching love story, Yun Fat and Lin have  a real chemistry. The ending always has me in tears no matter how cheesy it  is and predictable. I have shown this film to many of my friends, and i  watch as they laugh at the funny parts and hide their tears at the  ending.
All in all if you are looking for a hardcore John Woo, Ringo Lam  bulletfest, you may wanna give this one a skip. But if you are interested  in a cute romantic drama with action thrown into the mix, then you have to  see this movie. I would try to rent it first though- it depends on your  taste.
Also- beware of the tacked on happy ending. HK audiences started  to hate unhappy endings after the 1990's, so one was tacked on at the end  of this film. When the train leaves in the distance, that is the directors  original ending.",949363200,7,2335,4.135857461024499
1234791,2,B00000JMOU,"Being what I consider to be a huge fan of Chow Yun Fat, (and Hong Kong cinema at large) I'm disappointed to tell you this movie was an erratic, paceless, passionless exercise in BAD romantic comedy... with some monks,  supernatural powers, and bad dialogue thrown in for good measure.  The only  redeeming quality for this film, is obviously Chow Yun Fat.  Sadly, his  valiant attempts to save this film from itself fail utterly.  There are  enjoyable moments... interactions between Chow's character, and the monks  he is inexplicably living with (what's his cover again?)... but for the  life of me, I want desperately to know who made the Baseball uniforms with  SHAOLIN written on the back... and why were there 40 monks on the playing  field?  I'm glad it's part of my DVD collection, but only as an example of  cinema gone horrbly awry.  2 stars because Chow Yun Fat demeaned himself to  appear in it (and that was the good news).  Go out and get ""The  Killer,"" and ""Hard Boiled,"" to fully appreciate Chow Yun  Fat's great on screen presence before you delve into this film.",947548800,2,1080,4.71505376344086

7912761,5,B00000JMOU,This movie is very good. It stars Chow Yun Fat and Phillip Kwok in a minor roll. I love both of these stars.,1364256000,,108,3.739130434782609
7912762,5,B00000JMOU,This is the next to last movie Chow Yun Fat did in HK before coming to the US. While this movie isn't for everyone it's always been a favorite of mine. More love story than gun play. Commentary by Ric Meyers is a lot of fun. Packed well and arrived ahead of schedule.,1356480000,,267,4.056603773584905
7912763,1,B00000JMOU,"Treasure Hunt (Special Edition); Unfortunately this dvd was not a good copy, good portion of that skipped. I was unable to watch the rest of the movie.",1335657600,,151,4.62962962962963
7912764,2,B00000JMOU,"While Chow Yun-Fat is one of the biggest action stars in Chinese cinema, it must be remembered that he is also an established actor in both serious dramas and zany comedies. This film seemed to want to blend Chow's charisma as a hardened action hero with his abilities to give a strong dramatic performance and deliver a punchline; sadly, it fails.

The primary reason for this is that the movie doesn't blend the different moods very well. The tone jumps from a John Woo wannabe shoot-'em-up, to a piece of wacky slapstick, to what they were trying to pass off as an intense romance with all the grace of a boulder striking a moving train.

At about the halfway point, Chow, who was the only person consistently trying, seems to simply give up. One can't blame him when he's trying to play in a straight cop drama, and out of nowhere, a woman with magical powers takes him flying through the treetops. The fact that half the team of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' worked on this is blatantly obvious. It's this lack of commitment by Chow and his female co-star that makes the romance, which becomes the driving force of the plot, utterly devoid of emotion.

Even at its best, 'Treasure Hunt' is a movie that just reminds you of how much better work all involved have done in their careers.",1314316800,,1292,4.584415584415584
7912765,4,B00000JMOU,"From the perspective of someone who has a much higher appreciation of CYF's action film history than CYF's romantic-comedy/drama history, this film is a winner.  People are right when they accuse it of ""genre hopping.""  One minute a bloody gunfight will lead into some corny cop jokes.  Then some supernatural acts will lead into a love story which is then followed by quirky Asian comedy.  Some might chafe at the thought of such a stew, but it does work.
So, if you already have A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Hard Boiled, City On Fire, Full Contact, City War, etc. and are looking to branch out into CYF's less-action more-light fare, this would be a great first stop.  Also, check out CYF in Once A Thief, another film light on the bloodshed, but still interesting enough to own.",1022976000,8,783,4.686131386861314
7912766,2,B00000JMOU,"I've enjoyed Chow Yun Fat in both Action and Romantic films, so my disappointment in this movie is not because there wasn't enough action.  The weakness of the film is in the meamdering plot and lack of focus of the story.  At first the movie starts off in typical Hong Kong gangster violence and gun play.  But it shifts to a romantic (somewhat comedic) genre only to fall back into the gangster ending.  In such it leaves neither audience satisified.
The plot, such as it is, revolves around Chow Yun Fat, a CIA operative, trying to return a Chinesse natural treasure, which is of course a beautiful pyschic nut case woman.  Maybe parts of the plot were lost in translation or when I was dozing off, but if she is a Chinese treasuer - why is he trying to 'bring' her back to the US.  And if she is a US citizen how did she get kidnapped in China.  Then in the end out of nowhere the Head Priest at the Temple she is hiding at is kidnapped.  Suffice to say this leads us back to the typical mayhem and destruction of most Hong Kong action movies, which seems incongrous to the previous hour of the movie.
Chow Yun Fat does an admirable job, as would be expected, and if the movie had focused almost exlusively on the romance and mysticism of the story or on the stubbornness of leaders of the Shaolin Temple the movie would have been a lot better and more interesting.  The ending (after the gun play) has a nice touch about it.  The movie is a rental and you can actually see a little of Crouching Tiger in it, but don't go into it with high expectations.  And you wouldn't be missing much if you skipped over the first 20 minutes and just started the movie when he goes to Chine.",995760000,4,1682,4.291139240506329
7912767,2,B00000JMOU,"This movie just does not know where to go. It starts out as a gun/mob/government action movie. Then changes briefly to a family values movie. Next, a conflict of western/eastern mores and values. Then, becomes a love story with a lot of very cheesy jokes. And, increasingly, becomes a mystery, fantasy. Almost none of the characters including Chow Yun Fat maintain any kind of consistency in their behavior. Some are cruel, then kind or vice versa. Some are silly and then become very clever. Mr. Fat is all of the above. There are some nice visuals occaisionally. The major climactic scene involves a massive shootout that is totally unbelievable. By the time the romantic end arrives, I really didn't care.",992908800,3,708,4.908333333333333
7912768,5,B00000JMOU,"Sounds too good to be true, but this is a perfect blend of all of the above. A film that would never get made in the U.S. A great performance by Chow. Excellent gunplay scenes and one of the more touching romances. One of Chow's best outside of the John Woo/Ringo Lam films. Highly Recommended.",983404800,2,294,4.363636363636363
7912769,2,B00000JMOU,"My favorite Actionstar flops in this boring romantic comedywith very few highlights. SO EVERYBODT WATCH OUT ! THIS IS NOT ANACTION FILM. I know CYF can do many other things than spraying bullets all over, but this is pathetic. Even Anna and The king was better than this. 2 star for the supernatural theme.",954806400,3,306,4.685185185185185
