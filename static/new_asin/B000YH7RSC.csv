8260731,5,B000YH7RSC,"I bought this 7 years ago after trying many times to quit.  I was mostly committed but I hadn't even intended to quit the day I first watched it.  I figured I'd work up to it gradually.  But I never did smoke again.  The title was true!  Not one puff in 7 years.  I had very intense cravings but I managed to get through them with two crucial tricks: 1) watch the video every time you're struggling through a patch of bad cravings and 2) every time the urge comes up, don't entertain it.  Simply KNOW that the answer is NO and say the words ""It will pass"" - and it does pass in a few seconds every time.  At first it will be necessary to say this phrase about 5000 times a day, but if you keep doing it, it tapers off and the cravings space out more and more.  I watched the video twice a day for the first two weeks and then whenever cravings got too intense.  After a few weeks, I didn't need to watch it except for a refresher now and then.  You don't have to close your eyes - you can watch it (but give it complete focus).  And be sure you watch the whole hypnosis section each time.  I am very grateful for the day I came upon this DVD.  I'm on its page today because I was sending the link to a friend who wants to quit.  Don't give up on it too soon, keep watching until it sticks.  It's a great feeling to be a non-smoker and you can have that feeling.",1517184000,2,1361,3.9667896678966788

8260733,5,B000YH7RSC,"I got this DVD almost 2 years ago. I popped it in the player and began listening to her talk. After about 15 minutes of sitting on the couch listening to her talk about relaxing, I decided to take a nap. 'I decided to take a nap' wink lol I woke up to the menu relooping. I have since been smoke free for almost 2 years. Not only smoking but drinking alcohol as well. I love how my mind says I was in control and ""I"" decided to take a nap. I was hypnotized and I am grateful she helped save my life! It does not stop cravings but it does subconsciencely make you aware of how bad it is if you smoke. Each day was easier and it had me thinking 'if I go back to smoking now, I will have to start quitting all over again'. I feel better, no chest pains, no nasty cough and I'm free of that nasty habit that controlled me! I give a copy of this to EVERY smoker I meet. It is life changing!",1439942400,,885,3.868131868131868
8260734,1,B000YH7RSC,"Don't Buy...won't work in US DVD players. Made in U.K 2007...Am furious as merchant is most likely recycling this junk to Amazon US customers....I received a 'Used DVD'- discovered this from merchant after purchasing...Case has a one inch cut in plastic - DVD looks OK.
Tried it in my new DVD player would not run - TV informed me ""Local area Restrictions...No playback.""  Tried 2 of my DVDs and my DVD
works fine...but not with UK DVD's..........

Shipping nightmare, ordered 1/12/15 for I believe delivery 1/21-5, recently changed by merchant to Feb. 2. But got it today Jan. 22th.
Have been battling with quitting smoking since August, 2014 and this DVD is almost guaranteed to want to make u smoke....am currently
sucking on 2 nicotine lozenges to calm down.  Have not set up my printer so had returned label sent to local UPS store($2.00) charge. But
will still lose $2.00 and interest I pay on credit card(likely to be months)(based on shipping...).

Merchant should not be used by you ...got a USED DVD(specs say new) designed for Region 2 DVD players- and will not run in US DVD players.",1421884800,,1095,4.777777777777778
8260735,5,B000YH7RSC,"I smoked for over 30 years and watched this video one afternoon 4 years ago.... I have not smoked a cigarette since.  If you truly wish to quit smoking, I recommend dvd.",1358035200,,169,4.28125
8260736,5,B000YH7RSC,"I'd smoked over 35 years.  Over the last ten I had tried every ""new"" gimmick and drug out there in an attempt to quit.  I never really even entertained the thought of trying hypnosis for some reason.  I bought ""Hypnosis - Stop Smoking Within One Hour"" not really even expecting it to work for me.  I'd had so many failures, but I was getting really desperate and willing to try anything... even self-hypnosis.
Well, I don't know how or why but it worked.  I've been a non-smoker for one year and two months so far.  It really works.",1280966400,8,532,4.377551020408164
8260737,4,B000YH7RSC,"I bought the 2000 edition.  I used this.  Being highly adhd I didn't make time to do it properly but played it in the background while going about my daily life.  It did make quiting smoking easier.  It didn't make it crave free.  I think the conscious mind yells ""you are full of it!"" to overly positive programing or affirmations.  However, I believe the subconsious mind does work with them to make changes. Like I said it worked for me. I have been smoke free for 3 1/2 years and not going back.",1255564800,7,499,4.311827956989247
8260738,1,B000YH7RSC,The CD Hypnosis - Stop Smoking Within One Hour didn't make any impression on me at all.  It was a waste of money.,1246665600,5,113,3.9130434782608696
8260739,2,B000YH7RSC,"So after the pretty trite and ho-hum intro- they tell you to close your eyes - why put it on  a DVD??  I should have saved money and got the cd- but heck I thought there would be a swaying watch or a twirly pattern to hypnotise you.  It put me to sleep twice- (I tried to do it after I had already quit). But then again, it is three weeks (I also used a patch for the first weekend).  My wife also tried (after she had been off the smokes for a week) and it put her to sleep-but I was listening in the next room. Her rap tells you it is going to be as if you had never had tried a cigarette in your life-- so that is why I said  it does not work. It feels like quitting. Quitting is hard, and if I had never smoked a cigarette in my life, I wouldn't be craving them when I wake up, after meals, and when I get off a plane, when I drive, etc. It has been three weeks. Yay! There is also a book I read called never take another puff (from an old quit smoking thing).  Not taking another puff is more important because it is easy to quit, but really hard to stay a quitter.  I know now my addiction is an adversary, and it is trying to trick me into smoking again.  My Susan Hepburn DVD will be for sale. I don't think her hypnosis actually worked, yet it did not hurt.",1240531200,7,1266,3.8423076923076924
