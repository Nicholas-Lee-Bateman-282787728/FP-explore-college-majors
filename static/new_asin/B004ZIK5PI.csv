8449827,2,B004ZIK5PI,Shraddha is perfect but the story was decent but the acting didn't seem good on the actor's side and the story wasn't messaged through correctly. It's a good teen one time kinda movie but not a family movie.,1512864000,,207,4.473684210526316
8449828,1,B004ZIK5PI,0 stars.. Tahah Shah is the wrost actor if there ever was one.. he cant act. hes built very large and muscular like  a man on steroids. He has no talent for acting singing or danceing and this movie is terrible.  It tries to copy american movies but cant come close. Save yoru timea nd money and don't see thsi movie or anymovie with Tahah Shah.,1463529600,,345,4.212121212121212
