The women  are HOT, and the action is fast paced and lively. It is a white trash  free-for-all ! If you love Jerry, you will watch it over and over. If you  are not a Springer fan....have your head  examined, then check out Oprah's  book club! !",921369600,7,377,4.328571428571428

945431,1,6304982747,"I always watch Jerry Springer show on FOX58 everyday on weekdays and my boyfriend and I bought this DVD and its not like the regular show on FOX58 that we watched because FOX58 has some reality show but this DVD seem to be ""fishy""!! I do know that I don't like Steve because Steve seem to be control of the show and makes people piss off and Steve thinks he is the ""man"" of the show but Jerry seem to be more polite and understands people their issues. My boyfriend and I was planning to go on the show to be their guest but after my boyfriend and I watched with Steve in it and my boyfriend and I talked alot about it and we think Steve is the problem and we weren't sure if Steve is our host if we fly up to Jerry Springer show or not because Steve needs to butt out our business but we are trying to figure out why Jerry haveto put Steve into it to be a host of the show?? If you want to watch something more reality go watch Pay-A-View instead of this one it's 10 times better than this DVD!!! We are giving 1 star for this one!!!",1172188800,3,1034,3.9759615384615383
945432,2,6304982747,"I saw this DVD and found it very mediocre.  Jerry Springer's show at its highest peak in 1997 and 1998 had nonstop fighting from guests confronting each other, who are angry at each other and the audience is cheering them on.  Mostly the guests were people in bad relationships, yet needed to go on TV to vent their frustration.  The show's still on in 2005, yet I feel that it's run out of topics or things to talk about. Springer and his producers have overdone it by a third on its current 15th season. If that's true, then how come the shows that Steve Wilkos, the show's security guard, hosts are better that the ones that Jerry hosts? Maybe Steve should host his own talk show instead. Yet this DVD is a mangled mess of chair hurling, hair pulling, guests wrestling on the floor and so forth.  All over issues such as infidelity and cheating on the other man or woman. Yes, there is an audience for these kinds of confrontational talk shows, but does it have to take five security guards to break up two fighting guests? Something's really wrong right there! I don't know how anybody can get through any of those segments--it's exhausting and painful to watch in one setting! This show's schtick is getting old pretty quick these days!",1133740800,,1241,4.551569506726457
945433,3,6304982747,"...Just how many people out there think the Jerry Springer show is real. These are the same people who scoff at pro wrestling as being ""fake"". Here's news, folks: The Jerry Springer Show is SCRIPTED. ALL of it. COMPLETELY fake. I have several friends who appeared on the show (they are actors) and played a part. They were told what to portray, and how to play the part.

This doesn't eliminate the entertainment value of the show, however. Pro wrestling is entertaining even though it is scripted, the same is true of Springer. Just realize that what you are watching isn't real, and never has been. Remember when the allegations about the Morton Downey show being fake surfaced? The Springer show is today's Morton Downey Show!",1133308800,8,729,4.785714285714286
945434,5,6304982747,"This is a fun tape to watch when you want a great laugh after a hard day.

This is perfect tape for Jerry Springer fans, especially a fun look when Jerry Sprigner was at the top.",1118361600,2,178,3.9444444444444446
945435,5,6304982747,"Jerry Springer, along with that other Jerry (Seinfeld), ranks as one of the great comedians of 90s television, and he does so by playing a straight man to a stageful of trailer park trash soap opera.  At any given point, there are no more than 11 teeth among the guests, even if an entire family is being torn apart by someone's hortisexual affair with a trailing hibiscus.
Springer's stage is Darwin's waiting room, the shallow end of the gene pool.  These people are not even pond scum.  They aspire to be pond scum ONE DAY.  I mean if they really work at it!  Chubby chasers, incestuous bisexuals, Neanderthal brawlers, and women in shredded clothes populate Jerry's circus sideshow peek at the underbelly of Appalachia.
When I come home from work, I spread some pate on a cracker, browse through the poetry of Wallace Stevens, and listen to Verdi's ""Requiem.""  When I tire of this, I heat up some Pizza Rolls and turn on Jerry.",1068681600,9,931,4.646341463414634
945436,5,6304982747,"I have been watching the Jerry Springer show on and off again since 1991.  When I saw this video, I thought that it would be interesting to watch, as most of Jerry's 'clip shows' tend to be pretty funny.
When the video arrived, I watched it and laughed my butt off.  I especially liked the part where the guy and his 'chunky' wife got into it and started throwing food at each other.
I was really shocked the first time someone swore because I'm so used to the censor taking all of that out.  After that, the cussing didn't even phase me.
The extra 10 minuts of 'bonus footage' at the end really isn't all that great.  Just some out-takes.
If you've had a bad day at work, or a fight with a family member, watch this video and think ""Thank goodness, my life could be worse.  Someone could call and ask me to be a guest on Jerry Springer.""",1063929600,12,838,4.2125
945437,1,6304982747,"Okay, you know what you're getting into here folks. Low-grade antics from the trailer parks and ghettoes of America. This can be summed up by the following-wild fights over unfaithful lovers, sleazy strip acts (the two Black sisters who do this in front of their mother defies description, as well as the ""whip cream queen.""), bad manners, bad grammar, low I.Q.'s, you get the idea.
Anything you would not want your kids to see or want to admit that you watch around respectable people is here for ya. Recently, the Springer show has added a television set on top of a trash can in an alley in it's opening credits. That about accurately says it all. Shakespeare it ain't.",1007510400,4,672,4.65546218487395
945438,2,6304982747,"It is definitively not too hot for TV.  Don't expect to see much in it, just your usual, every day, talk show, with a marketing fancy title attached to it.
Besides, most of the clips are the same: ""I slept  with your brother"", and then a fight starts.  It's better to watch a  Jackie Chan movie for that.
It's maybe nice to see once, but  disappointing to own.",962323200,2,360,4.235294117647059
