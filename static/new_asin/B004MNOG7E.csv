8436149,5,B004MNOG7E,"What an excellent DVD workshop this is. Carrie Burns Brown does a wonderful job of demonstrating how you can make personalized paper in a variety of ways. Much of the DVD focuses on staining art tissue paper with paint but it also shows how lovely one-of-a-kind papers can be created by fusing tissue paper with newspaper print using gel medium, or by adding thick gesso to the tissue, resulting in a thick paper that feels like leather.

Brown also works with other papers like textured wallpaper, corrugated paper and Kozo rice paper, with which she creates a fluid swirly design using clear tar gel. Different ways of adding texture to the stained tissue are shown - for example, by using ground coffee or fiber, stamping or adding more paint through various techniques including with textured and smooth brayers.

In the video, Brown creates a collage using the various papers she has made herself. In the process, she gives tips on tearing and collaging paper, as well as design and color combinations. The resulting piece is so vibrant it really makes the customized papers stand out even more. I found her techniques of staining tissue and customizing paper very refreshing and the best thing is that the colors will not fade with time, making the artworks created with the papers archival.

Brown's teaching style is very clear, concise and not once did I get lost. Great DVD!",1329696000,6,1384,4.8559322033898304
