513747,5,6302795451,"Loved this small chamber piece of a play. It suggested the roaming Rep companies and that whole world of putting on repertory theatre, and all the people, craftsmen, acting parts,technicians, electricians, who worked to support each other. I've never watched this all the waythrough, just seen the opening scenes. I didn't realise it was about this great actor's last role, Lear cradling Cordelia, 'Sir' giving employment to The Dresser, Norman, dependent on Sir for work. Also you had the women in his life, Lady (Watson) his life partner, who has stuck by him but wants out, and Madge (Lancashire) the stage manager who has secretly loved him for years, and the star-struck stage girl whose legs he asks to see and feel,who he tests for her acting future by how easy she is to lift up,to become another Cordelia. Of course there is the analogy with a two-parter Beckett play like Endgame. Albert Finney plays Sir with a crumbling,gargantuan ease; Tom Courtney plays Norman with a sprightly-footed, elfin charm,hitting the bottle, ducking the abyss. Its a master-servant relationship. We see the essentials of thunder machine operation and the esoteric rituals of make-up.

This world of provincial theatre has a nostalgiac feel with the gallery of actors in the leading Shakespearean roles and all the subsidiary parts. There is an amalgam of Shakespearean lines and the backstage world of a touring company,they become fused in a timeless zone, with each feeding into the other. Harwood has said he based the play on the veteran actor-manager Donald Wolfitt, who he worked with, as did
Harold Pinter(who may have been Oxenby who wants Sir to read his play). The ego-colossus of the stage, shown becoming forgetful of his lines and which particular play hes playing on the night, is held together by the faithful, insignificant Norman,who is shown making the ultimate sacrifice to keep the show on the road. The action takes place in the Principal Dressing Room, wings, stage and backstage corridors of a provincial English theatre during an air raid. The tyrannical actor manager, who toured the provinces with his troop of actors, making uncomfortable rail journeys, is now extinct. The Dresser is a funny, beautifully observed portrait of a shabby backstage ego at odds with the glamour and greatness of his presence on stage; and the man who sacrifices his own life to keep him going.",1447113600,,2390,5.0353535353535355

513755,4,6302795451,"Based on Harwood's successful play of 1980, THE DRESSER details the relationship between ""Sir"" (Albert Finney), an actor/manager of the old school and Norman, his dresser (Tom Courtenay).

Set largely in and around the streets of Bradford, Yorkshire, Peter Yates' film offers a vivid recreation of performing Shakespeare during an air-raid, when the actors had to announce to the audience that they would continue the play, despite the risk of being hit by a stray bomb.  To a man and a woman, the audience stay put to enjoy ""Sir"" playing King Lear; this was precisely what happened in most theaters.  Yates captures the cramped backstage conditions in a Victorian theater (part of the No. 1 touring circuit); the dressing-rooms shared by most of ""Sir""'s company, and the cramped wings where the actors waited for their entrances and exits, while the backstage staff (such as they were) had to provide the sound-effects using primitive materials such as a kettledrum, a wind-machine and a thunder sheet.  With little or no real opportunity to purchase new things, the company have to make do and mend: for example, purchasing cornflour to use as impromptu make-up for their Shakespearean repertoire.

Based partly on the experiences of Donald Wolfit - who was not a 'ham' actor (as some reviewers have suggested), but a performer of the old school - THE DRESSER shows ""Sir's"" dedication to continue touring, despite being manifestly unable to do so.  Tormented by the ghosts of actors past, he believes that he can no longer give of his best; the only way he can be patched up to go onstage is through Norman's continual promptings.  Finney captures the monstrous egotism of the man - who can be downright cruel to his fellow-actors yet in the next moment behave like a baby needing comfort from his carers.  ""Sir's"" acting-style can best be described as full-on, complete with extravagant gestures and meaningful pauses.  It might seem exaggerated to modern viewers, but to wartime audiences in England his productions provided much-needed respite from the strains of having to survive.  The production design (by Stephen Grimes) owes a lot to Wolfit's inspiration; ""Sir's"" costume as Lear, and the settings are both based on the designs used in the actor/manager's stage production, which played from 1943 to 1953.

As Norman, Tom Courtenay is a protean figure - at once solicitous, angry, kind, vain, jealous and loyal.  His entire life revolves around ""Sir""; however much he might object to his employer's behavior.  At the end he is bereft, as Sir passes away, and Norman wrings his hands and wails ""What am I going to do?""  Like the loyal stage-manager Madge (Eileen Atkins), he has been working in this touring company for a long time with no real thanks; and the fact that his name has been omitted from Sir's dedication in the opening paragraph of his (unfinished) autobiography proves especially galling for the Dresser.  On the other hand, both Norman and Madge emphasize the strong sense of loyalty that dominated the old touring companies; despite meager salaries, poor living-conditions and indifferent treatment from their employer, they refused to do anything else, in the belief they were part of ""one big happy family.""

The casting of minor roles in THE DRESSER has been carefully thought out. Lockwood West makes an endearing Geoffrey, an elderly actor pitchforked into playing the role of Lear's Fool, although manifestly unsuited to the role.  His equally elderly colleague Horace Brown is played by Llewellyn Rees, whose previous employment included a spell as Donald Wolfit's company manager in the early Fifties.  Edward Fox turns in a malicious performance as Oxenby, a lame actor with a barely-suppressed hatred for Sir's authority.

Although three decades old, THE DRESSER remains a highly entertaining piece, as well as being a valuable recreation of an important moment in British theatrical history which remains comparatively neglected by scholars.",1414713600,2,3980,5.13312693498452
513756,4,6302795451,"Peter Yates directed Ronald Harwood's adaptation of his play, based on the famous touring ""ham"" of the British provinces in the pre and post war (WWII) years, (Sir) Donald Wolfit. Wolfit appeared in occasional supporting roles in film but was notable as a larger than life stage actor (too large, some said) with his own touring company, taking on the ""big"" roles - King Lear, Othello, Shylock etc. The cast is exceptional: Albert Finney (as ""Sir""), Tom Courtenay as his effete and devoted dresser (""Norman"")(both actors were nominated for Academy Awards for 1983), Eileen Atkins, Edward Fox, Cathryn Harrison, Michael Gough, Zena Walker. Finney is richly entertaining (reminiscent of his later playing of Winston Churchill in The Gathering Storm with Vanessa Redgrave) as a self-absorbed egotistical old marshmallow. The film fails to succeed in moving you at its denouement, perhaps because the two lead characters are in fact caricatures and we are left somewhat unaffected by them at the end.

513759,5,6302795451,"The Dresser is basically a two-person piece equipped with a great script and brilliant actors.  The two characters are, ""Sir"" an aging actor-manager who has spent his life pushing a small company of actors through the provinces and giving performances of Shakespearean plays, an honorable (if not wealth-making) profession at that time and Norman, the attendant who fetches, carries, harries, tends, coaches, begs and does the impossible in order to get Sir through each performance.  In short, Norman is his dresser.  To make their chaotic lives worse, WWII is going on and, as Norman says ""All the best actors are in uniform and the theatres are bombed to bits before you've even booked them.""  Everything they need is rationed and nothing is right, including Sir's mind which slips from reality and from play to play, despite Norman's best efforts to keep him focused.  The entire film is a tour de force as Albert Finney (Sir) and Tom Courtney (Norman) struggle to survive through the worst that life, the Luftwaffe and King Lear can throw at them.  While each man gives an Oscar worthy performance, it is their byplay that makes this performance worth watching again and again.  Their timing, pitch and response show without exposition the long relationship of checks and balances that exist between the two men and how each needs the other to serve a higher purpose.

Anglophiles, Theatre buffs and Shakespeare nuts will all enjoy this film but anyone who loves great acting will enjoy this gem of a picture.  Some marvelous British actors fill the smaller roles beautifully (including the wonderful Edward Fox) and the script is one of the wittiest ever filmed.

Sure, I could appreciate the splendid acting and dialogue...but the range of human emotions was beyond my range.  I had to mature.  I had to become a caretaker for a loved one.  I had to experience the death of my twin sister who chose to live a life in the theater. I had to become emotionally intimate with another.  Then, and only then, did I get it.  And WOW is this film powerful.

On one level, it is a film, possibly the best film about the meaning of theater.  An aging and once great Shakespearean actor is reduced to playing second rate venues in the provinces when all the good actors are off to war against the Nazis. The year is 1940...the fate of the war is uncertain.  Theaters and homes are being bombed.  And yet, ""Sir"" the lead actor continues on playing the major roles of the Shakespeare plays...having never missed giving a performance.

He is now exhausted, physically and emotionally.  He is seriously ill..near senilty.  And yet - like the soldiers faced with another dreary, impossible day...he goes on.  But it is all made possible now by his dresser, his confidante, his caretaker, his friend, and most importantly, his intimate.

And more than anything else, this is a film about intimacy.  It is quite clear that Norman (brilliantly played by Tom Courtenay) has a homosexual crush on his 'Sir."" But more than that, they really are a pair, feeding and working off each other...Sir is an outstanding actor because his dresser has the skill, reverance, and love to make it happen.  In a sense they perform - together.

When ""Sir"" dies at the end, and Norman opens up a cascade of emotions on seeing his friend -quietly dead, his life purpose - coldly dead, this movie gives the most amazing dramatization of grief I have EVER seen on the screen.

So...see this when you are 20...40...and 60...and you will experience different parts of the film in different ways.  You will understand the pure genius behind this drama and respect the splendid acting that makes the catharsis all possible.",1286668800,16,2149,4.664893617021277

Although immensely popular after the initial release, Peter Yates' solid, well-acted, if somewhat forgettable drama The Dresser (1983) has fallen by the wayside despite garnering five Academy Award nominations and numerous BAFTA nominations.  The film is above all a vehicle for some noteworthy acting by two veteran British actors (on stage and in film) Tom Courtney, as the effeminate manservant Norman, and Albert Finney, Norman's master (an aged Shakespearean actor), who goes by the odd name Sir.  The supporting cast is also up to the task-despite remaining in the background- since they shine in their infrequent scenes.  The Dresser, adapted from a well-known Broadway play, still has the feel of theater and doesn't fully embrace the cinematic medium.  One gets the frustrating sense that the film version doesn't add anything to the original theater version (albeit, I haven't seen the Broadway production).

Brief Plot summary (limited spoilers)

The year is 1940 and Britain is devastated by the Blitz.  Sir (Finney), an increasingly senile Shakespearean actor, is the head of a rag tag theater troupe touring Britain's provinces of elderly and occasionally resentful actors, a distant and increasingly heavy (and thus hard for Sir to carry) wife, and a besotted stage manager (Eileen Atkins).  Sir is attended to in all aspects of his daily life and preparation for his roles by Norman, an effeminate manservant who gives everything to keep Sir on the stage (for example, reminding him hour to hour the name of the play to be performed, the first lines, reminding him how to put on his makeup, washing him, etc etc).  The film spans the production of King Lear, played by Sir.  Norman pulls out all the strings to prepare Sir and his own feelings (and resentment) come to fore.  It is the dialogue and interaction behind the scenes of the production between Sir and Norman which constitutes most of the film.

My Thoughts

The Dresser is entirely a character driven film.  Peter Yates' visuals are minimal and uninvolved on purpose.  Occasionally, we glimpse scenes from the production of King Lear but these sets are worn and faded reflecting the dire situation of the troupe and war torn England.  This stark, dreary, subdued feel (especially with the panic inducing air raid siren) throughout reminds the audience of the historical backdrop.

Both male leads are well fleshed out characters.  Norman, a immensely caring and loyal servant, yearns for the slightest recognition of his efforts from other members of the troupe but above all, from Sir.  Sir himself, who in his senile state (and most likely before) perhaps thinks too highly of his own abilities (he attempts to pen his autobiography at various points in the narrative), maintains an external charisma despite his inner turmoils and confusion.  His dual persona -- the one he shows on stage and to the various other members of the troupe who don't fully realize how senile he's become and the one we see through his interactions with Norman -- is immediately and disturbingly apparent.

My only qualm in regards to the two characters is the occasional overacting.  This makes sense in regards to Sir who carries his Shakespearean mannerisms and voice into his daily life -- however, even this tends to get somewhat grating and forced.  The character of Norman is also often overacted which has the unfortunate result of reducing his character into the realm of clich and type (the homosexual British man).  These are somewhat minor qualms and shouldn't detract too much from these two wonderful portrayals.

This is a dark film.  No scene is superfluous (besides occasionally, the acting).  I've always been interested in films about movies and films about theater so The Dresser was a must see.  I'm not sure that this is a classic -- a sentiment reinforced by my sneeking suspicion that unless I write this review I would soon forget the images and characters.  If one likes good, solid, dark British dramas this is a great choice which deserves at least a little resurgence of the recognition and praise it initially received.",1282953600,2,4365,5.0643356643356645
513784,4,6302795451,"Director Peter Yates assembled a pitch-perfect cast for this look behind the scenes at a touring British theatre troupe in WWII England. Albert Finney is the imperiously named 'Sir', the star-manager of his motley crew of struggling thespians. Since all the able-bodied youth are off fighting Hitler's war, Sir's troops consist of 'old men, cripples and nancy boys'. One is given the impression that the 'Coronet Players' are distinctly third-rate, but top-notch acting goes on backstage between Sir and his fastidiously devoted dresser, Norman (Courtenay, who originated the role in the stage production). Finney chews scenery lustily, by turns bombastic and maudlin, but the show really belongs to Courtenay, who anchors the film as the steady center of Sir's (and the company's) universe. By turns cajoling, buffoonish or castigating as called for, Norman spurs his narcissistic yet pathetically unbalanced boss through his 227th performance of King Lear. The choice of the play-within-a-play is no accident; the events on stage mirror what's going on backstage, with Sir as Lear, the increasingly deranged 'king' and Norman as his faithful Fool, the clown paid to keep the monarch's spirits up, and the only one who is privy to the king's true state of mind. Apart from his ritual Guinness after the show, Sir is not shown to drink alcohol, while Norman is constantly tippling brandy out of a flask in his back pocket, so to attribute Sir's breakdown to alcoholism alone is too glib. ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown"", to quote the Bard--Sir has literally cracked under the strain of keeping the many bodies and souls in his care together during the extreme deprivation of war. Yet despite everything, people are so hungry for Art that they sit unfazed through an air bombing. That is why for Sir and Norman, the show has to go on.

513786,5,6302795451,"Always a theater-struck addict, I, sometime in the winter of 1981-1982, sat in a Broadway theater watching magic take place on stage. Outside it was wickedly cold, snowy, slushy, as I sat at a matinee performance with water slogging in my boots, watching a marvelous production of Ronald Harwood's ""The Dresser"" starring Tom Courtenay as Norman, the theater dresser for Sir, one of the famous actor-managers who toured the British provinces bringing Shakespeare to the hinterlands. Sir was probably modeled on Donald Wolfit who was one of the legendary touring manager-actors.
 The 1983 motion picture with a screenplay by Harwood, brought together Tom Courtenay as Norman and Albert Finney as Sir. The time was World War II, and German planes were bombing some of the cities where the troupe appeared. Sir is on his last legs, under extreme pressure. He has chosen a difficult group of Shakespearean plays for his small touring acting company to perform including ""King Lear"" which is a difficult and exhausting role for a strong, healthy man to perform. The company is in Bradford, and Sir sees the fire brigades fighting to put out bombing fires. He's exhausted, and it's been a struggle to find a cadre of actors to be in his troupe because of wartime demands.
 Sir has an attack and has to go to the hospital the night he's supposed to play Lear for the 226th time in his career. He discharges himself from the hospital, but he is in terrible condition. Norman, Sir's dresser, who idolizes his employer, is the only one who can keep him going. He knows every trick to jump start the old man. He knows the lines of the play as well as Sir does.
Madge, the stage manager, played by Eileen Atkins, who also adores her employer, thinks Sir is too ill to go on, but Norman insists he can be ready and gets him up for the part by his powers of persuasion. Norman fights off the other cast members and bullies them into letting him get the old man ready. It's touch and go whether Sir can go on or not.
The movie does a beautiful job of portraying an England at war, and showing how a theater production looks from backstage. The scenes in which Finney as Sir is applying his make-up with Courtenay's Norman prodding him are masterful. The fuss budget Norman has only his nips of brandy to keep him going. Sir is egotistical, domineering, fond of the ladies, and a fine actor. Finney and Courtenay are both absolutely superb in the movie. If you love theater and actors, this is the movie for you.

Albert Finney gives a grand performance as ""Sir"" the patriarch and star of the troupe and plays the part to the full grandeur of the old theatre.  Tom Courtenay, in the title role, tends to Sir's every desire and demand.  It seems a thankless job, but he knows his importance and does it out of love.  Though his is an effeminate character, modern perceptions of 'gay' are kept out and the character is allowed to be real.  Sir is spiralling toward dimentia and his dresser is determined to help him through one more play.  If you like character studies, this is a great movie.",1240185600,2,702,4.531746031746032

513789,5,6302795451,"This is not a big spectacle type film; it is a small and personal film that makes a big impact because of the very, very strong performances it has holding it up.  `The Dresser' is a superb example of the very fact that you don't need to do a whole lot when you do very little very well.  Both Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay deliver knock out performances here, both of them pulling from within to deliver top notch emotionally invested portrayals of men defined and ultimately confined by their loyalties.

The film takes place during World War II and tells the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor who owns his own production company and is about to put on his 227th performance as King Lear.  His dresser, Norman, is there every night, nursing him back to sobriety and convincing him that his life's passion is the theater.

The film is less about a particular plot and more about the relationship between these two men; the fact that they need one another to make it threw each day.  Sir is helpless without Norman's guiding hand, and Norman has devoted so much of himself to Sir that he doesn't know how to live without him.  Sir is Norman's life, and so he has become much like a parent (or maybe more like an over protective spouse) to Sir because of that.  Even as Sir's habits and bullying (almost self centered) attitude pushes all others away, Norman finds himself drawing closer to Sir as he almost pleads for acceptance and some sort of reciprocated affections.

Without the strong performances of both Finney and Courtenay this film would have been a monumental bore; a failure.  Thankfully both Finney and Courtenay deliver boundlessly.

Finney is one of my personal favorite actors, for he always knows how to evoke an emotional response from me.  He has such a natural progression to his character's development and so he makes for a very believable and commanding actor.  As Sir, he embodies this man's every weakness without every taking away from the natural compassion we feel for him; thus helping us to understand why a man like Norman is so devoted to him in the first place.  He's like a big, helpless Teddy Bear.  Tom Courtenay has the tougher job of delivering believable paternal affections and he does so marvelously.  What is so phenomenal about Courtenay is that he creates a complete character, from the facial expressions to the hand gestures (I love his hands in this film; almost like a character all their own) to his voice and his very choice of words.  He delivers a brilliant performance that uses every quality of a caricature while reining it in just enough to make it natural and believable.

Also, look for Eileen Atkins in a beautifully restrained performance as Madge.

I can't say enough how much of a pleasure this film was for me.  It is the perfect example of a `character driven drama' and it serves as a marvelous centerpiece for some breathtaking acting.  If you are a fan of Shakespeare, Albert Finney or dramatic period pieces then this is a MUST-SEE film if ever there was one.",1238457600,2,3039,4.674812030075188
513790,5,6302795451,"[As a train is leaving a station]
Sir: Stop that train!
[The train stops at once]

This scene demonstrates the power of acting. Sir (Albert Finney), the head of a Shakespearean acting troupe in Britain, used the authority in his voice that comes from playing King Lear in 227 performances and various other kings and characters an equal number, to stop a train in its tracks. Norman (Tom Courtenay), Sir's dresser, had begged the conductor to wait for just a moment, and was told in no uncertain terms to ""sod off."" The train left the station on schedule. But then the command to stop that train from the regal voice of Sir stopped the train at once.

'The Dresser' gives a fascinating look behind the scenes, at the backstage drama--the drama behind the drama. Sir may have a voice that can stop trains, but trying to keep a Shakespeare company on tour during war time Britain is quite a chore. All the young and able bodied actors are away fighting, and it is hard to keep an audience enthralled when you are interrupted by air raid sirens and there is the very real possibility that the theater will be bombed. What is troubling Sir? Is it the critics?

------------------
Sir: The critics? No, I have nothing but compassion for them. How can I hate the crippled, the mentally deficient, and the dead?
===============================

Thank you, Sir, for that heart felt vote of confidence. I will try not to disappoint you. In spite of his criticism of critics, Sir is a master thespian, and he knows whereof he speaks:

----------------
Sir: Keep your teeth in!
Geoffrey: It's only when I'm nervous
Sir: You will be nervous. I guarantee it.
===========================

Though Norman, a shy and effeminate dresser, is not much use when it comes to stopping trains, Sir relies on him to the utmost. Sir, like King Lear, the character he is portraying, is getting old and loosing his mind. The stage manager and other cast members doubt that he will even be able to perform. There was an incident earlier in the day that showed that Sir was totally insane. He went berserk and was rescued by the dresser, who knew exactly what to say and how to handle him. Backstage, getting ready, he keeps forgetting which play they are doing and Norman has his hands full getting him on track. He even quotes 'Macbeth' which is a very unlucky thing to do according to thespian superstitions, and requires a whole ritual to undo the damage.

--------------------
Sir: 227 Lears... and I can't remember the first line.
===========================

Norman remembers them, and he cues Sir, and on with the show. You get the feeling that Norman remembers not just the first lines, but all the lines. He hovers backstage during the performance, cuing Sir from time to time if he gets stuck. Why then isn't Norman an actor?

----------------------
Norman: My memory is like a policeman. It is never there when you want it.
================================

Exactly. He is great at feeding Sir his lines from backstage, but put him up there and he would freeze like a deer in the headlights. There is a great scene where Norman must make an announcement, and he reluctantly does it, standing on the corner of the stage with a rag in his pocket, barely able to quell the pre show chatter and get the audience's attention. He blows his line, he is supposed to say ""anyone who wants to leave"" because of the bombing and the air raid but instead says ""anyone who wants to live"" which is the worst sort of mistake you can make under the circumstances.

Oblivious to how much he stunk; he later asks the cast members how he did. Great, they all reply very insincerely, which Norman accepts without question, due to an ego protecting suspension of disbelief.

Sir also has his fears though, and when they must ask if Oxenby (Edward Fox), one of the actors, will help backstage operating a wind machine for the big storm scene in King Lear, he makes Norman do it. Norman has no trouble in situations like this, drawing power from Sir, even though Sir himself is afraid to do it. Oxenby feels it is beneath his station, and refuses; though later, caught up in the drama, he does help out after all. They all make a supreme effort, and storm up a storm, but does Sir appreciate it?

---------------
Sir: WHERE... WAS... THE STORM?
=====================

Ronald Harwood based his play and subsequent screenplay on his experiences as the dresser for the noted Shakespearean actor Donald Wolfit. Harwood has created an excellent script for a brilliant cast. You really get a sense of the human frailty, ambition, desire, vanity, and weakness behind the masks. It is a really different view of the theater, backstage and through the eyes of the person who knows firsthand the reality behind the play, the dresser.

Peter Yates also directed 'Breaking Away,' 'Krull,' 'Bullitt,' and 'Mother, Jugs, & Speed;' but I would venture to guess that 'The Dresser' is his best work, as cast and story combined to reveal not only the mortality of man, but also the immortality of great art.

513791,5,6302795451,"There's a very peculiar review here by one Eric A. Daily, who thinks that the eponymous Dresser is played by John Hurt. Oh no he isn't. It's Tom Courtenay, in one of his most affecting performances. I saw Courtenay play this on the London Stage nearly 30 years ago; unforgettable. By the time I saw the play, Finney had left the cast and ""Sir"" was played superbly by Freddie Jones, a sometimes underrated, undervalued actor who still is working on UK TV, although now in his eighties; we should be so spry. But this film boasts Albert Finney, and in him and Tom Courtenay you have two of the British theatre's -indeed the World's- greatest living actors.

As the playwright Ronald Harwood has repeatedly said, the play (and film) are based on his own experiences dressing the great, legendary, barnstorming actor Donald Wolfit, who made relatively few film appearances but whose voice was powerful enough to rattle the front-of-house chandeliers. So this is a loving and poignant elegy to a particular era and a particular style of acting that both have passsed from view. This is neither good nor bad, it's just the way things are; cyclical and ever-renewing, because tastes change and interpretations of the classic texts shift from generation to generation. However... experience tells me that when some of today's British theatrical Knights are booming their way through Shakespeare and Chekhov, the backstage corridors at the National Theatre may yet echo with passions and tensions and the creak of over-stretched egos that would sound very familiar to Sir Donald Wolfit's still-growling spectre.",1220832000,8,1602,5.068181818181818

The film is a psychological delight, with each part played to pefection and with the exquisite cruelty of Finney as he imitates in real life the unhinged Lear treating his utterly loyal cast and in particular his poor Dresser, whose only job is to please his boss, with shallow disdain and contempt.

The end is a testament to the love and devotion of a single-minded servant and his ill-appreciated - although deeply fulfilling - reverence for his master.

Albert Finney's acting and nuances in the film are unbelievable and totally convincing. This film is highly recommended. The film stars Albert Finney as a traveling Shakespearean actor whose own life is in under tremendous stress. He is beginning to lose grip of the mental faculties in his own life; and while he is undergoing these stresses in his life, and the continual breakdown of his sanity, he is assisted in his theatre performances by his dresser (Tom Courtenay). Courtenay's performance compliments Finney, and the two give a outstanding acting performance.

Both of these actor's give their ALL in this wonderful performance, as they try and keep the audiences entertained during the war [WWII]. However, the performances are beginning to become a strain on Finney. With his life already complicated and in dire need of rest, his motto of 'The Show must go on' keeps him entertaining the audiences at the detriment of his own health. With the always faithful companion of his dresser (Courtenay) close by to help assist the old Shakespearean actor on his last legs, the film makes for a very sad and touching film. I don't want to give away anything in the film which will ruin it for you, however, I will write that Finney and Courtenay give a touching and superb story of a freindship whose time has come, and the director, Peter Yates did an admirable job with the film and its characters.

I rented this years ago before the days of DVD's, and it so affected me that I watched it every day for a week.  Albert Finney gives the performance of his life as he portrays the role of an ageing Shakespearean actor who litterally gives the last performance of HIS life.  The movie is set in 1940's England.  Finney plays the ageing head of a Shakespearean company, which travels from one theater to another, trying to bring a bit of happiness to the war weary population.  He himself is weary and tired as he struggles to keep his company together, and weather the storms of air raids and bombed out theatres.  Finney's character finds himself slowely losing grasps of reality as the pressures of age, the war, and having once again to ""dawn his robes"" and play ""the most difficult role any shakespearean actor must endure"", that of King Lear.  John Hurt plays his faithful and dutiful Dresser, Norman.  Hurt is equally engrossing as his character tries desparetly to keep Finney from losing his mind, and at the same time, not let the rest of the Company know that something isn't quite right with their leader.  Norman also struggles with the herculean task of keeping Finney's character focused on the one thing that he was born to do, and that's to portray King Lear.  The enite cast is excellent as well.

Courtenay is wonderful as the fussy, loyal, oh-so-English man behind the man, maintaining a desperate hold on his good humour even as his life is coming apart in shreds as Finney disintegrates.
It is easy to see that Finney was classically trained, and that his booming stage voice must have rung through many a theater. The snatches of Shakespeare that we do see are great fun, as is the byplay between the old man who can do them in his sleep and even the most humble members of the crew, who by now know all the cues. But mainly this is the story of two men, one an artist who is used to taking what he needs from those around him, and the other who gives his life over to that man, and to some idea of carrying on the great work.

Tom Courtenay is the actor's dresser--a consummate professional who now faces the tackle of piecing back the shards and fragments of his creation--the actor who must go play Lear.
The only thing you need to know are the two main actors: Finney and Courtenay.  Both were nominated against each other in the same category of lead actor in the Oscar race. Both were worthy of winning, and perhaps that is precisely why they both lost.  They are both powerfully over the top in different ways--Finney being out of control and constantly in a state of dramatizing his backstage life like he is in front of an audience, and Courtenay as his rather prissy, fretting, ""keep it together"" devoted caretaker of his on-screen partner.  The relationship between the two is intensely professional, very confrontational, and very personal.  If those all sound contradictory, yes.  For these actors to pull this off on so many different levels is amazing to watch.  Their vocal battles are superb and highly entertaining.  The only reason I can figure out why they lost their nominations are because the roles were both at the same level of campy, showstopping pompousity.  They equally shared the screen; it is impossible to figure out who is the true singular leading man in this pair.  The film's tightly matched duo makes you ponder the eternal question of who is the true artist--the performer, or the one who prepares the performer to be who he is?
See this excellent piece of cinema; it is truly a feast of great acting.

7831458,5,6302795451,"Best version ever. Amazing performances, heart and soul, Albert Finney  and Tom Courtney are heartbreakingly human. One is grandiose, insecure dependent, the other loving, supportive, takes in the chaos and drama with the help of alcohol and compassion, There is real loving devotion from the dresser and an implicit trust between the two. In the later version McKellen plays the dresser as a self pitying disappointed drunk. His anger and  disenfranchised  persona, makes him a sad old gay man who wants the glory of the old actor played by Anthony Hopkins. He admires but more than that envies and despises his difficult master. The Albert Finney version was inspirational",1474848000,,674,5.165137614678899
