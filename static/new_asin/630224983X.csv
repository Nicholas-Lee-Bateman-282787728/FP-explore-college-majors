449976,3,630224983X,"No flying rocket men, no masked avengers, no silly atomic ray machines, ""Government Agents vs. Phantom Legion"" is an unusually gritty crime drama about a gang of thieves who are high-jacking government payloads from trucks. Lots of fist fights and cars plummeting off of mountain roads. In sum, this serial may seem a little pedestrian in concept, but it has a low improbability factor and lots of action.

But the real reason to watch this chapter play is the presence of Dick Curtis as the villain's Number One Henchman. Curtis is a veteran of the Republic stock company of heavies, but he was rarely if ever used to better advantage than here. Not only is he possessed of a face only a mother could love (if she was Ma Barker, perhaps), but from time to time, we see Curtis actually GRINNING as he is about to send off the hero to his doom. The definition of success is loving what you do, right? Rarely has a henchman seemed to draw so much understated pleasure from being a henchie as Dick Curtis.

All in all, ""Government Agents"" is a kind of no frills Republic chapter play from the early fifties. Several of the cliff-hangers are recycled, there is a dull re-cap chapter, and the hero is not memorable. (And the final scene is another of those finger-nails-on-the-blackboard excruciatingly awful attempts to end with everyone laughing.) But the picture and sound quality are great, and watching Dick Curtis chuckling quietly to himself as he tosses the hero out of fifth-story window is worth it.",1381622400,4,1504,4.736641221374046
449977,4,630224983X,this is a fifties serial and is a little bit more complex than just back and forth--they use the you gotta figure out which one of the guys at the meeting is the bad guy thing again.  walter reed the lead from flying disc man from mars is in it.  this is more complex than that one but that one has the appeal of having mars involved in it.,1367280000,2,340,3.9130434782608696

FYI, I bought this from Cheezy Distribution via Amazon along with several other titles because they offered the best price, and they refunded me more than 90% of the system-generated per-title shipping costs, only charging me what it actually cost to ship the DVDs.  For the volume of titles I bought, purchasing them at a lower price from Cheezy and paying only five bucks to ship the lot was a far better deal than buying the DVDs at a higher list price from Amazon to get the free-shipping-over-$35 deal.",1433894400,3,775,4.923076923076923
