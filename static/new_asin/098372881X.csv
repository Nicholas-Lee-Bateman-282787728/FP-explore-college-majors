7795195,1,098372881X,"I want to put a real review here to go along with fans of ""The Room"" and sarcastic reviews. This is not a good show, and you should not buy it.

Tommy Wiseau is the writer/director/producer/star of ""The Room,"" a really bad movie that was terrible in every respect. It was supposed to be a romantic drama about a guy fighting with his girlfriend. The writing, direction, and acting all sucked. But the movie sucked so bad that it achieved a ""so bad it's good"" level of cult status. Now Wiseau is trying to pretend that he meant it to be funny all along. He's re-styled it as a ""black comedy,"" and is now pitching himself as a comedian. He's doing other projects like this one to show how funny he is.

""The Tommy Wi-Show"" is supposed to be a sort of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for videogames. Wiseau is locked in a room by an alien and forced to play videogames. In every ""episode"" (which are only a few minutes long), Wiseau played a few rounds of a different videogame like ""Mortal Kombat"" or ""Duke Nukem Forever."" Let's be very clear about that - each episode is just five or six minutes of watching Wiseau play a videogame. The idea could be great if there was an actual comedian in the room.

The set is actually really good, nice and alien-looking with lots of detail. But it's just one room, so it might as well be. The ""alien"" is a guy with a bad and fake-looking mask and big monster hands. The TV is okay...I mean, it's hard to review the production, because there's so little of it. But it's all right.

Now as for Wiseau's performance. It's terrible. He's not good at playing videogames at all. Often, several minutes will go by of him trying to figure how to even play the game. Unless you like seeing someone fumble around with a controller for five minutes, there's no reason to watch for that. What people who buy this probably think is that he'll say and do funny things, but he is not funny. He doesn't even really make real jokes in the episodes. It's obvious he thought he didn't need a script, and would just be funny on his own. But the only reason he was funny in ""The Room"" is that he was trying to be serious. Wiseau trying to be funny is even worse than when he was trying to be serious. All he does is sit there and mumble and curse and yell, and most of it is unintelligible.

You can see this show for free by searching for it online, so there's no reason to buy the DVD unless you really want to give Wiseau money. Please don't. Make him stop.",1474156800,3,2476,4.293361884368308

7795197,5,098372881X,"My partner knows that this is the go-to method of cheering me up when I'm down. It's just so ridiculous and there are so many hilarious one-liners. Incidentally, I had Tommy Wiseau sign a copy at a screening of ""The Room,"" and he seemed kind of miffed that I liked it so much. :P I do like ""The Room,"" too... fans of one will likely enjoy the other.",1447718400,3,349,4.147058823529412
