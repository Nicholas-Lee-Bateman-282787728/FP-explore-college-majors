This is a very rare & valuable collection that contains contents of Disney Animation/Other series from the past. My favorite in this collection is definitely ""The Chronological Donald Vol 4"". As a kid watching most of these Shorts/Animated series I had to get my hands on this collection. I was able to get this for $1295 & as the time goes by this collection will be worth more than what I paid for. Just watched few shorts with the kids & they totally enjoyed it as I remembered watching these amazing cartoons back in the day myself.

If you are a True Disney Classic fan, this ""Collection"" is more than just a ""Collection"". I am a proud owner of D23 Walt Disney Treasure Premium Collection!",1392595200,,810,4.4
8385781,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"Just received this set today,bought it for 700 dollars off eBay. Bit expensive but it was the cheapest one i could find, all the other sellers were selling it over 900 dollars which is ridiculous!
The only downside of this set is there is no swamp fox Elfego Baca and Zorro seasons 1 and 2 on it but suppose cant get everything! I would strongly recommend buying this set and looking out for a reasonable price for it. Even the one i bought for 700 dollars was a bit expensive but i really wanted it lol.",1348012800,2,504,4.260416666666667
8385782,3,B0030CZZ1Y,"This is an amazing set with nearly every Walt Disney Treasures included. It really was a great savings when released for $500, but for 3x that amount, its a terrible deal. The score is for this particular collection, the DVD sets themselves are fantastic. Read on for reasoning.

You could build this set yourself for less than 1k, and thats buyout prices from ebay/Amazon. You would also get the collectors tins, programs for each set, and postcards with poster art, which look great framed.

Furthermore, its likely that there are a few in here you don't even care for. If you're not nostalgic for the live action programs like Hardy Boys, you probably won't be entertained by them. Maybe i'm being presumptuous, but the only live action one I really enjoyed was Davy Crockett(I should mention though, I am much too young to have been around when these were popular, which could account for my disinterest).

If you are ONLY interested in the animation, definitely buy them piece meal. You could probably get everything (including On the Front Lines, Behind the Scenes at WDS, and Rarities which all have some fantastic animation programs) for about $700. The real road blocks are Chronological Donald volume 3 & 4, which can easily fetch $100 each at this point, but they are worth every penny (especially 3, it has many of the best Chip & Dale shorts).

So here is my advice!
1.  Watch them on ebay for a few weeks to get used to how much they auction for. Look particularly for auctions ending at odd times like late at night or early morning, or really anytime before 2PM PST on weekdays.

2. Know when to bid! If you KNOW it will bid high and you aren't worried about cost so much as making sure you're the winner, bid early and make sure to make it a little on the high side to avoid losing by 50 cents.

On the other hand, the cheapest way to win is usually to bid your highest price in the final 10 seconds. This avoids somebody bidding you up over and over until they are on top, and you wouldn't believe how often the high bidder is content to be winning by $1. With 10 seconds left they also likely won't have time to put another bid in.

3. Buy a few cheap ones to make sure this is important to you. I recommend Donald 1 or 2, Mickey Black and White 2, or On the Front Lines(I can't recommend this enough, this set is just fascinating if you have even a passing interest in what Disney was doing during WW2).

4. Make sure you're building the set you want. I kept buying random ones here and there before I realized Donald 3 and 4 were getting so pricy(understandable with their extremely small print runs), and they have only gone up since. The only sets i've seen go down at all are Mickey believe it or not.

My last bit of advice? Buy the Silly Symphonies sets. They are going up a bit but you can easily get them for $40-50 each. They are just gorgeous and are still entertaining even for small children. I was shocked at how silent they were while watching these through.

Thanks for reading!",1327104000,12,3013,4.430379746835443
8385783,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"It is crazy how expensive this set is being offered on Amazon.  I am shocked that Disney only released 3,000 copies.  I was fortunate to have stumpled across the set when I searched the online Disney store back in May 2011.  I have a 1 year old daughter and I would like to be able to experience the orginal disney Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Pluto, etc...  cartoons that sadly Disney does not block any time into the Disney Channel Line up.  I love the classic Disney Shows that came out even before I was born in 1980.  I think that the Current Disney Channel is a disgrace.  Except for the cute pre-school shows that come on in the Morning for little kids (my daughter loves the ""Mickey Mouse Club House"" and ""Handy Mandy"" is pretty cute too), the rest of the channel is mostly trash.  What ever happened to Disney showing feature film classics such as Swiss Family Robinson, etc... Sadly, unless parents can afford to buy the Dvd's, if they are even available, most children will never know the true magic of Disney, the way Walt Disney orginally invited it.  Anyway, I was lucky because, this set was available for $500 off of the Disney Store website, plus I had to pay about $37 for the right to purchase this set by joining the D23 fan club.  Even though, I didn't quite want to spend that much money at that time, I am so thankful I did.  I saved it as a family Christmas Present.  Who can say if Disney will re-release this Collection.  But if you look at the price of some of the individual dvd sets on Amazon, I know I got a bargain and I got lucky that I looked at the right time.  I basically paid about $20 for each of the 27 CD collection.  Within a couple months, I checked back and noted that this collection is no longer available.  A release of only 3,000 is going to sell out fast.  Good Luck to all you Classic Disney Fans.",1325116800,7,1840,4.3023255813953485
8385784,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"I'm sure most of you who are reading this have figured this out, but this set is long out of print by now. Sadly, buying it second-hand is the only way to get it at this time. However, I do highly recommend it anyway. It is by far my favorite DVD collection. Especially if you're a Disney animation fan, this is a shortcut to owning nearly every animated short the studio ever put out. I can't recommend it higher.",1321401600,,414,4.253164556962025
8385785,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"This is one of the nicest collections I have ever owned...first, do not buy it here...I paid $ 580 for it on the d23 site. This included shipping and tax.

My only complaints about the set are as follows.

There are no itemized list as to what's on the dvd's like the regular treasures discs
The certificate of authenticity is nit individualized with. Specific number.",1283385600,7,368,4.6461538461538465
8385786,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"You can join disney's D23 Silver Membership at the disney store website for $35. The set sells for $499.99. I did this, the set is great and a lot less than the prices here. However if you want a set you better act quick before they are all bought out (limited to 3000 copies) and sold here at a nice profit. One note Zorro Complete Season 1, Zorro Complete Season 2 and Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox: Legendary Heroes Disc 1 and 2 will not be included in this set. Hope this is a help to some of you.",1270425600,55,501,4.02
8385787,5,B0030CZZ1Y,"This is a special set only available to the Disney Fan Club called D23. The do not buy from another store for more than what it costs to buy direct from Disney. You have to become a member of D23, which is not cheap, but still better in the long run that some prices posted on here.

I bought mine through D23 and LOVE IT. Some of these DVDs are selling for over $100 each, so this is a bargain if you do not already own them. Nicely put together! These are not only cartoons but some great documentaries on Disneyland, and other shows.",1267315200,4,536,4.153846153846154
8385788,5,B0030CZZ1Y,Posting this as an FYI. This is a D23 exclusive offer for the Disney Treasures Collection available through Disney's D23 website. The membership is 75 dollars and the collections is 599. Be careful and don't over pay for this amazing collection of some of the best cartoons and movies ever created.,1263081600,26,298,4.862745098039215
