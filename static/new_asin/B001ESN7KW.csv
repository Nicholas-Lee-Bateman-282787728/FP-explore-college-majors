8299453,4,B001ESN7KW,"Like humans, all AirUtopia's airport DVDS are NOT created equal. Some are better than the others. For me, the important dividing lines are camera angles, variety of airliner and airline types. If an airport is too dominated by a particular carrier or two (usually the home carriers), plane watching becomes boring and monotonous as you grow saturated by the same plane types with the same liveries. Camera angles also are crucial. If the camera is set too much towards the end of the runway, you miss almost all of the really exciting scenes of an airliner's operation such as touch down, flaps, slats and spoilers deployment, reverse thrust, acceleration, rolling and liftoff.

By these conditions, San Francisco is one of the better airport DVDs from AirUtopia. The camera angle is set along more or less the middle of 2 different runways and no one airlines dominate the scenery at the airport. The latter is no doubt due to the fact that San Francisco, being a Pacific gateway for Asian carriers, boast one of the most international airports in all of USA. All major US domestic carriers are represented as are most important Asian and Latin American carriers. Coming with the territory of a great diversity of airlines is the great diversity in aircraft types. Both long rangers and short rangers are plentiful with Boeings quite a bit more abundant than Airbuses. Wide bodied Airbuses esp are glaringly few.",1272499200,,1413,4.936974789915967
