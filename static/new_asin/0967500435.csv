7793981,4,0967500435,"The video work is great.  Phil Liggit's favorite adjective for describing the 1999 riders is ""little,"" as in ""the little spaniard,"" or ""that little man.""  Count how many times he says little.  Anyway, both tapes are great fun to watch, but the audio mixing on the 2000 tapes is awful.  You can barely hear the commentary beneath the very loud music.",998438400,,349,4.672131147540983
7793982,5,0967500435,"This set is so enjoyable that I can only say that I wish it were longer!
The shots are beautiful, and the stage by stage set up makes for a thrilling ride along...I watch it a little by little, not wanting to miss anything, and will use the videos for indoor training....keep the boredom away and the inspiration flowing!
A well-produced set!!",976579200,7,343,4.548387096774194
