8713843,5,B00WNU5320,"My nephew is a huge kung fu panda fan. He wakes up craving kuuung fu. He's quite picky though, he only enjoys kung fu panda in 3-D animation. Some of the DVDs/episodes are 2-D, and he is very clear which type he prefers. This is a really nice length of entertainment for the price. If you have a someone in your life who loves kung fu panda, and your eyes and ears are tired of re-watching the original movies over and over again... this is the discovery for you! 7 hours of NEW episodes... And a great new theme song at the beginning. :)",1440028800,2,538,4.1826923076923075
