4587703,5,B0056ASE9S,"You may cry at the end as I did.  This film explores the Navaho culture and the four genders of that culture, offering brief interviews with two spirit people and Fred Martinez' mother and friends.  I now wish I had bought the film instead of simply renting it, as I know I will want to see it again.",1331596800,4,300,4.155172413793103
4587704,5,B0056ASE9S,Absolutely beautiful.  A multidimensional story about the gorgeous complexities of people's sexuality in our First Nations.  There is much to learn about the True Americans' perspectives on life.,1321142400,5,195,5.928571428571429
4587705,4,B0056ASE9S,"In the old epic movie, Little Big Man, starring Dustin Hoffman and Chief Dan George, we are introduced to a transgender Cheyenne who is regarded highly by the tribe. This was in 1970. That enlightened view by indigenous people has contrasted over the decades with sometime lethal homophobia of present Western society. This documentary film, while following the tragic story of one Din/Navaho boy, presents historic and modern accounts of ""Two Spirit"" Amer-Indians, those with both male and female nature, including homosexuals and transgender people. Many nations of Native Americans have traditionally accepted four genders, but such acceptance had largely been lost under the assimilative cultural policies of the government and Christian missionaries. Today, there is a renaissance of Two Spirit recognition and support. With their special insight, Two Spirit people have served as counselors and healers. The film weaves interviews with the mother and friends of the boy with Two Spirit people from other tribes, who offer other examples and background. The film points out again the spiritual wisdom of indigenous peoples so ignored by modern society. Together, it is an interesting and important documentary, which I viewed on a local PBS station.",1309219200,14,1254,5.469072164948454
4587706,4,B0056ASE9S,"There's a huge myth out there that says only Ancient Greece approved of homosexuality and every other time, culture, and region hated it.  Work on Native American groups have suggested that those with unique gender presentations or sexualities were appreciated by their tribe.  Instead of thinking that there are masculine men, feminine women, and looney tunes, many tribes saw gender as a spectrum.  I encourage readers of countless races, sexualities, and nationalities to read as much as they can on the Two Spirits.

This documentary is an example of it.  A boy born with the name Fred Martinez grew up to sometimes be called Fredericka or Beyonce.  Tragically, he was brutally murdered by a young bigot.  Matthew Shepard (sp?) will always be missed and celebrated, but he was a class-privileged white male.  Fredericka's tragic story brings issues of race, class, and rurality to the discussion of anti-LGBT violence.  For those who mourn and celebrate the losses of Shepard, Venus Xtravaganza, Brandon Teena, etc., this is important to see.

This would be an excellent documentary to show during gay-straight alliance meetings.  I  thank the makers for producing it tremendously.  But know in advance, it does deal with a tragedy and it does give just one example of a Two Spirit person.",1308528000,12,1293,5.1
4587707,5,B0056ASE9S,Great documentary!,1418860800,,18,8.5
4587708,5,B0056ASE9S,Very Inspiring! I wish the America today was as forward thinking. Thank you for doing this documentary.,1414713600,,103,5.117647058823529
4587709,5,B0056ASE9S,This documentary does an exceptional job of showing two civilizations colliding and how that has changed modern perceptions of how the LGBT community is to be treated. One culture reveres LGBT as a bridge between the sexes and the other reviles it. The personal story of the young man murdered for being himself and those that loved him like his family and school teachers was quite touching. I highly recommend it.,1408406400,,415,4.859154929577465
4587710,5,B0056ASE9S,"I finally saw this documentary. There is a lot of negative disinformation about this video to not watch it (technical difficulties, etc.) but the documentary was put together respectfully and it was worth the viewing.",1404777600,,217,5.228571428571429
4587711,5,B0056ASE9S,Get a thoughtful and sensitive peek at a Native American mother's grief process and get a wonderfully fresh perspective on the LGBTQ community.,1399334400,,143,5.260869565217392
4587712,5,B0056ASE9S,I feel that you try looking at this DVD if you would like an accurate perspective of the transgender community.,1393804800,,111,4.6
4587713,5,B0056ASE9S,This documentary is one of the strongest I've ever seen. It tells a fascinating story about a much-overlooked aspect of Native American cultures. Just as compelling was the filmmaker's decision to minimize attention to the personal details of her informants. I finished watching the film wishing it had been longer and that we had had a chance to hear more from these individuals.,1389830400,3,380,5.0476190476190474
4587714,5,B0056ASE9S,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who seeks knowledge. It was a great documentary with good
two spirit information. It also showed how the lives of two-spirits can be effected by the outside.",1388361600,,196,4.794117647058823
4587715,4,B0056ASE9S,"Having grown up in AZ next to the Navajo Reservation and having many Navajo friends I was excited to get a copy of this documentry.  I had heard about the story of Fred Martinez and was curious to get more information.  For the most part this is a good documentary, a bit amateurish at times and could have benefitted by tighter editing, but worth watching.  Also very good counterpoint to the recent New Mexico decision to legalize Same-Sex Marriage while the Navajo nation still refuses to allow this.  Their law against Same Sex marriage only was passed in 2005 and is much more an example of how anti-LGBT bias has permeated the culture. Once the ndleeh were very respected by the tribe.  Apparently this is no longer the case.",1388188800,3,731,4.635658914728682
4587716,4,B0056ASE9S,Good film - I had to watch this for my class and explain it.  It was well thought out and put together.,1383955200,,103,3.6818181818181817
4587717,5,B0056ASE9S,"This documentary not only recaps the life of Fred Martinez, a transsexual Navajo boy who was murdered at age 16, but also provides an in-depth look at the roles of gay and transgendered people in the Native American culture.  I found the film informative and respectfully done and would highly recommend it.",1382832000,,307,4.903846153846154
4587718,5,B0056ASE9S,A great movie about awareness about the Native and transgender communities. Would recommend everyone watch this movie today on Amazon.com!,1381017600,,138,5.95
4587719,1,B0056ASE9S,"I would give it a zero because there are no closed captioning or subtitles available for deaf/hard of hearing for the instant streaming version. I am deaf and was not able to watch it at all and want my money back. However, I cannot find the appropriate contact info to file such a claim. It is also a punch in the stomach to have to pay $17.95 to buy it in order to view it with captioning/subtitles when mainstream viewers can freely watch from instant streaming for $2.99. There are Two Spirit people who are deaf/hard of hearing and this isn't the only film we want to watch. Multiply the infinite number of many wonderful uncaptioned/unsubtitled documentaries we wish to see....you get the picture. This is just disempowering and discouraging. We matter, too.",1380931200,10,764,4.7518796992481205
4587720,5,B0056ASE9S,"We purchased this for a documentary night at student LGBT group I used to run, and everybody was encapsulated by it. Very informative, very respectful, and quite a gut-wrenching story. Great for classes, I recommend it for all High-School and College-aged students.",1377388800,,265,5.333333333333333
4587721,5,B0056ASE9S,This is a wonderful movie that I would recommend over and over.  It provides a historical perspective that was new to me.  After watching the movie I want to learn more!,1373414400,,169,4.419354838709677
4587722,3,B0056ASE9S,"I am writing a major paper on Two Spirits so I bought this because I understood it would be more about Fred Martinez, which is what all the hype makes you believe. The rest of the information about Two Spirits I could find anywhere and had already. Very disappointed...",1359590400,,269,4.510204081632653
4587723,4,B0056ASE9S,"The movie was compelling, heart breaking and uplifting. The acknowledgment of gender beyond the binary and the acceptance of gender variant was eye opening. I watched it twice and recommend it for everyone.",1359590400,,206,5.2727272727272725
4587724,4,B0056ASE9S,"I enjoyed the film. It's message and content where intriguing, but the actual execution of story was a little amateur.",1357689600,2,118,4.95
4587725,4,B0056ASE9S,This was an enlightening film and also sad at the same time. It just showed that the Native Americans were so advanced in their understanding of human nature-it was the early Christians that perverted their way of life.,1352851200,4,219,4.7894736842105265
4587726,5,B0056ASE9S,"This a documentary that all human beings should see. All of us need to understand gender so we can eradicate hate crimes, all of have the right to be happy in our own way",1349481600,2,170,4.029411764705882

8459346,5,B0056ASE9S,"Excellent movie with great information about the history of Two Spirits.  The story of Fred is told with compassion and not sensationalism, which is a nice change of pace.  Thank You, Lydia, for writing such a beautiful documentary!!",1473206400,,233,5.105263157894737

8459348,5,B0056ASE9S,Product was delivered as predicted and arrived well packaged. This amazing documentary should be mandatory for today. Discusses the Native American views on LGBT and prejudices. Wow and we think we are civilized!!,1468886400,,213,5.484848484848484
8459349,4,B0056ASE9S,"Russell Martin, the author of The Sorrow of Archaeology and Beethoven's Hair, was involved with the production of this film, which is why we watched it.  It's worth watching.  The sound quality is sub-standard, unfortunately.  Sometimes we could not tell what language was being spoken, but we got the message and were uplifted by it.",1453766400,,334,5.036363636363636
8459350,5,B0056ASE9S,"Superb film that brings to attention important issues surrounding gender, cultural clashes, colonialism, and prejudice. A must see!!!!",1435795200,,134,6.5
8459351,5,B0056ASE9S,"This video gets the point acoss that Native American culture has been tainted by European dogma and the contradictions of Christianity.  Language is one of the most important reflections of culture.  By the fact that Native languages recognize four gender types/roles within the culture exhibits that people were accepted and valued, no matter how they presented themselves.  I am only using the past tense as current beliefs are often corrupted.  Unfortunately, many Native people today have bought into the gay-bashing wagon.  My heart goes out to Frank's mother.",1423267200,,565,5.375
