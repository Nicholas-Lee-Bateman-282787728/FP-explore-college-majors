8380026,3,B002TCHY4M,I am being generous.  This is actually awful in all aspects.,1453507200,,60,4.454545454545454
8380027,5,B002TCHY4M,"Important document about an interesting phase in his career. Good music, good quality. Thanks!",1445558400,,94,5.785714285714286
8380028,3,B002TCHY4M,"I'll just join with the other reviewers here to say that while the performances on this video are top notch, the sound stinks, so you'd best be a big fan of Miles' music of this period because you'll have to suffer through a lot of compromises to watch this disc.  I'm happy to have any video at all of Miles from this period; after those many years listening to Pangaea and Agharta it's a real treat to finally get to see what the band (mostly the same personnel) looked like when playing.  But the sound is mud, highly distorted and blurry, and it keeps shifting around so that at the beginning Mtume's up front, then that backs off and Pete Cosey's up front, then it backs off and Dave Liebman...The only person you hear consistently up front is Michael Henderson.  Sometimes it's hard to hear Miles.

I'd give anything for a copy of Miles at Montreux 1973, I've seen it on YouTube, it's a great performance by this group and the sound's a lot better.  But I don't want to buy the whole Montreux box set just for that one disc.  So for the present, I'll make due with this Vienna concert.",1404691200,,1091,4.376237623762377
8380029,4,B002TCHY4M,"If your a nit pickin' audiophile, you will be unimpressed with the sound and vision of this DVD.

I would have preferred stellar sound of course, but this is a welcome edition, not a whole lot of the ""Cosey Band"" on DVD, and to see Pete ""R.I.P."", WHO WAS A BEAST OF GUITARIST going nuts is worth the price alone. The music is still very good, and after you get into the groove, the less than ideal sound fades from your mind.

If you are a jazz funk or Miles Electric fanatic you should have this DVD.

EXPECT A MONO SOUNDING MUDDY BOTTOM END SOUND, I have tweaked my system several time finding a decent sound, you might have to experiment with this DVD for sure.

For completests only, but you need this DVD if you are.",1353542400,,721,4.240875912408759
8380030,3,B002TCHY4M,"This is a B- grade boot in terms of video and a B for sound. But the performance is so great you don't care after getting sucked into it. In contrast to the reviewer below, I found it very watchable.",1333152000,,199,4.0
8380031,1,B002TCHY4M,"I just watched the complete performance of this MILES DAVIS concert from 1973 on youtube, after recieving this DVD of the very same show, the ""STADTHALLE VIENNA"" concert today. I bought the MILES DAVIS STADTHALLE VIENNA DVD thinking that the youtube broadcast was created from the DVD on sale here. NOPE! IF ONLY! The youtube broadcast was recorded onto DVD (or perhaps VHS) from the 2008 WDR TV broadcast of this concert, and its an ""A"" or at worse an ""A-"" quality. The sound was clean, the image sharp and the color fully true to life. So, for what POSSIBLE reason would the ""JAZZ VIP"" produce this DVD off a VHS VIDEO recorded from a VHS VIDEO recorded from a 30 year old BROADCAST of the concert? (JAZZ VIP video productions even used their ""JAZZ VIP"" logo to cover over the TV station identity stamp in the corner of the screen.) Why use a second generation, or more likely a third generation tape, of a concert that was broadcast within the last couple of years? I know what bootleg VHS tapes look like, and how they are graded. I've seen enough second generation tapes, to recognise the distortion caused by making a copy of a copy of a copy. There is NO REASON for these bootleg DVD manufacterers to use such a distorted, unwatchable version of a concert that you or I can watch RIGHT NOW on youtube in near perfect quality. Even if the master tapes were destroyed, and it was a rare copy of a historically significant show unseen for decades, to recieve a DVD so distorted in quality is UNACCEPTABLE!

Of course, it could be the DVDs are mismanufactured, in which case they should all be returned. But i doubt it, since this is apparently the same company that produced the same quality DVD of another show from MILES 1973 european tour, that is equality unwatchable (STOCKHOLM 73). I have NEVER once bought a DVD or VHS tape of any concert or movie, even one where Amazon reviews complained of poor video quality, and recieved such a crude, unwatchable product. It doesnt matter that this is a good performance. For fans of Miles, you know his band is of such high calibre, that they cant play a poor performance. At worse Miles might play an uninspired show, but all his performances are ""Good"". The fact remains, this DVD's quality is the lowest of amateur standards, and I am completely serious. IT remains indisputable... The video and audio is horrible, and unwatchable. AVOID THIS.",1320624000,9,2397,4.626760563380282
8380032,5,B002TCHY4M,"If you are one of those people (most likely a male electric guitar player but what do I know?) who has discovered the incredibly dense, funky, psychedelic music Miles Davis made with Pete Cosey, Al Foster, Michael Henderson, Reggie Lucas, Dave Liebman and Mtume and ""just can't get enough of that funky stuff"" then you want this video.

It's true, the video quality is certainly not all that great and the sound, while not terrible, is never going to be described as outstanding.  It isn't audience-recorded bootleg bad but it isn't great either.  HOWEVER, - you get to watch this band in action at the top of their game.

This was clearly an incredible concert to witness live and, since you and I couldn't be there, all we have apart from ""Agharta"", ""Pangea"" and ""Dark Magus"" along with bits from ""On The Corner"" and ""Get Up With It"" is this footage (and the CD version).  For me, the DVD is worth it just to see what the heck Pete Cosey's hands are doing while he's making all those amazing sounds. That really sums up my need to obtain this.  If you want to see what Pete Cosey was doing to create all that sonic weirdness, buy this, otherwise, skip it.",1316908800,2,1157,4.485714285714286
8380033,2,B002TCHY4M,"This DVD is for hard core Miles fans like myself. This is a 5 star performance by one of the most unique bands in history. I saw this band play many of these same songs (although Miles never really plays the same song twice) in a club in Phila in 1974, and it was probably the most memorable performance I've ever seen in my life. Since then, I've always been on the edge of my seat, waiting for a DVD to be produced showcasing this band. This is an absolute killer performance, but unfortunately, the recording sounds like it was made on a cheap mono cassette recorder circa 1974. The video isn't much better either. What a shame!

As was the case on Agharta, some of the songs are mislabeled. ""Turnaroundphrase"" is really ""Moja"" from Dark Magus. ""Turnaround"" can be heard on the On the Corner Sessions and ""Prelude"" on Agharta. Also, the tune labeled ""Funk"" is really a continuation of ""Right Off"" which is roughly a 9 minute version. The rhythym section on this band is unlike any other. Pete Cosey shows why he is ""the man"" on Calypso Frelimo. Perhaps someday someone will come across a high quality video recording of this incredible band. I'm still waiting.",1271808000,22,1163,4.564593301435407
