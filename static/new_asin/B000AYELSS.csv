8080678,5,B000AYELSS,"Janacek is steadily rising in the pantheon of 20th C opera composers, with more productions and more attention to his whole corpus of works. The Cunning Little Vixen is the latest success story; on the surface, a fairy tale based on a cartoon, featuring almost as much dance as singing, it would seem unlikely to be profound and emotionally compelling. But it is. The Huntsman, the principal character, stands and sings a concluding aria which is fuller of the love of life than anything I remember in any other opera of any era in any language! The orchestral music, as you'd expect if you know Janacek, is strangely original and ""modern"" and yet instantly accessible and enjoyable. There are two DVD productions of The Cunning Little Vixen, both well worth viewing and hearing.",1161475200,6,779,4.864661654135339
