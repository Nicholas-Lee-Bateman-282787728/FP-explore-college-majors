1663630,2,B00005U8EL,"Like the reviews say, this is a modernized update of Shakespeare's Othello.  If you never read Othello in lit class or on your own, you'll probably like to know that it was one of Shakespeare's more popular tragedies.  In other words, if you're into happy-endings, you WON'T find one here.
As far as updates go, this one is actually VERY true to Shakespeare's original (character names, plot lines, plot devices, etc) as opposed to comparable films (like Romeo and Juliet with Titanic boy several years back...).  Points to the producers for staying true to the original.
Basically, the overall story is about a jealous, psychotic plot of mind games.  Bitter about being passed over for an MVP award and being overshadowed by the team's Black MVP Odin (Mekhi Phifer), White basketball player Hugo (who is also the coach's son, played by Josh Hartnett), sets in motion a sinister plot of mind games to bring down Odin using friends and lover, Desi (Julia ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", ""Save the Last Dance"" Stiles) as pawns.  In all, the story is pretty decent, although the actions of Hugo can be kindly labeled as ""disturbing.""
Beautifully filmed, with a solid hip-hop, basketball, prep-school theme and with a semi-solid story (although some of the plot is a little non-sensical, all this over an MVP award and being upstaged???) the good points about the movie end here.  It's the politically incorrect, highly disturbing ending which really mars this film.  Clearly not for ""impressionable"" kids, this movie does feature prominently the sick mind games of Hugo's character, drug use, an intense sex scene (which is cool with me...) guns and TONS of graphic violence at the end. The films completely tragic ending will leave most with a REALLY bad taste in their mouths.  Despite it's delayed release (completed in 1998, the release was IN FACT delayed because of the school shootings of recent years) it is amazing in the wake of Columbine and other school shootings that this film EVER saw the light of day.
It's actually a pretty powerful film, in fact a true piece of art for filmography.  The images at the end will just leave you shocked (like a good tragedy should).  However, if you're like myself, you'll more than likely will NOT like this film as, I repeat, the ending leaves a REALLY bad taste in your mouth.  If you are into sinister mind games, psychopaths, and senseless violence, by all means, THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.  Otherwise...
Recommendation to Avoid.
On its own merits:  4  stars
Because of the tasteless ending: 1 star",999734400,6,2541,4.851851851851852
1663631,5,B00005U8EL,"I saw this movie about week ago and it was great. Everyone was perfect for their roles and the acting was very dramatic. Mehki Pheifer did an excellent job as Oden (Othello with a different name) and Josh Hartnett was the perfect jealous person. The plot and screenplay were great and had a lot of good twists. This was a great adaption of Othello, and the director did a good job of making the movie seem modern but yet still Shakesperian. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who likes Shakespeare and/ or dramatic movies.",999734400,,526,4.5473684210526315
1663632,5,B00005U8EL,"I saw ""O"" at a special screening of the UrbanWorld Film Festival
in New York this past summer and it left a profound impact
upon me and others in the viewing audience.  The movie received
an ovation at its conclusion.  The cast was superb and featured
mesmerizing performances by the gifted young actors, Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles, and Josh Hartnett.  A new generation of
students will be ""turned on"" to Shakespeare by this dramatic
and spellbinding motion picture.  I applaud Tim Blake Nelson's
vision and daring in placing Shakespeare's greatest tragedy
in an American southern highschool setting and, without using
Shakespeare's prose, achieves high dramatic and emotional
effect.  See it!",999648000,3,693,5.263636363636364

I thoroughly enjoyed this film because more than anything, I found it to be realistic; it took an unblinking look at the issues it dealt with, and I was all the more grateful. Bravo.",999648000,3,526,5.127906976744186
1663634,4,B00005U8EL,"Okay, I confess. I never read Othello. I really do promise I'll read it soon. <G> But I trust the people who say it's a good rendering.
So, why was this one of the year's best? It's a powerful story which try as you might to resist, draws you in and keeps you involved. The acting is wonderful and the feelings you experience on this roller coaster ride are strong and sometimes surprising.
Now last week, I broke my usual rules and watched a horror movie, Jeepers Creepers. (Shouldn't have broke the rules. But that's another review.) This movie was more horrifying, and it had a much more grotesque monster. Humans make much uglier, nastier monsters, don't they?
This is definitely worth the eight bucks. I can see why they held off releasing this film after the Columbine catastrophe.  And I still hold some fear that this kind of movie could inspire some sad, sick kid to go out and hurt someone.
As a matter of fact, the reason I didn't give this five stars is because it has a negative character arc and I while I prefer happy endings but can live with others, I have to wonder what positive messages this story teaches. .
Mekhi Pheifer and Josh Hartnett play riveting, intense roles and Julia Stiles does a great job as Mekhi Pheifer's love object. She's the one good person in the story.
Well, off to read Othello.",999561600,,1322,4.508333333333334
1663635,4,B00005U8EL,"I just got back from seeing this movie.  First of all, I'd like to say that I've never read ""Othello"" or seen the movie so I'm not going to try to compare this movie with the original.  I only knew that ""Othello"" was an interracial love story.  Now I know that it has a elaborate plot and that jealousy is the main theme.
Realism means a lot in pictures like this to give the viewer a sense of where the characters are.  The film has reasonably good acting, but flunks miserably in giving the impression that this is actually taking place down south.  Only some of the older actors seem to have southern accents and one of the students tries to sound southern but does a poor job.  Most of the characters in the film sound like well-educated northerners.  Even Mehki Phifer who plays Odin (the main character) sounds like he was raised in a Philidelpia suburb.  At any rate, he definitely doesn't sound like he came from any kind of ""hood"" as he is supposed to portray.  Odin speaks very good english and uses very little street slang.
Both Julia Stiles and Mekhi Phifer are terrific actors (with the exception of not being able to pull off southern accents) and will probably have many good things come their way.",999475200,,1214,4.4818181818181815
1663636,4,B00005U8EL,"It is clearly understandable why they put this film off. It was originally going to be released 2(?) years ago, but with the school shooting in Littleton CO, they decided to put it on hold.
The movie is slow going but with a message. I'm not certain though, that the message made it through the movie because at the end of the movie, the kid still wanted to and was looking to fly as high and with the other students. Does that mean that doing and planning what he did, he succeeded or he plans to achieve it because of it? I'm not sure or clear on that.
Hopefully people will get the message that by doing something like this...it doesn't solve anything. And I'm hoping that with the start of school and if kids choose to see this movie that they would get the positive ""let's not resort to that"" manner than the ""that gives me ideals"".
The young actors and actresses in the film did a fine job. And I thought they portrayed the situation well.",999216000,,945,4.314606741573034
1663637,5,B00005U8EL,"""O"" is a film directed by Tim Blake Nelson which is based on the William Shakspeare play, ""Othello"". Set in a modern-day high school setting, this film is about Odin James (Mekhi Phifer - I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER), the only black kid in a high school full of white rich students. He was accepted into the school to help the basketball team with his basketball skills. He ends up winning over the dean's daughter, Desi Brable (Julia Stiles - SAVE THE LAST DANCE). Then the coach's son, Hugo Goulding (Josh Harttnet - PEARL HARBOR), becomes jealous of Odin because he used to be the star of the basketball team and get all the attention from his father until Odin showed up. Now Hugo comes up with an evil, bloody plan for revenge that will shock the school with tragedy.
This film was completed in 1998. But due to the recent high school shooting masscarre, it kept getting delayed. But it was definitely worth the wait! Beautifully filmed, gifted, talented young actors, and an original, cleavor script, this will be an excellent adaptation of the play, ""Othello"". (And hey, when you ask for tickets at the theaters it won't even be a very difficult name to pronounce!) It will probably be a major box-office hit, too. I definitely recommend this drama to anybody! Go see it August 31st (I know I will eventually see it in the theaters), and I know you will not regret it.",998438400,64,1385,4.566265060240964
1663638,5,B00005U8EL,"This movie isn't out until August, but as long as it has Julia Stiles in it it is outstanding.  She has impressed me as an actress that is making quite a mark in Hollywood.  Her presence lights up the screen everytime and keeps your attention as long as your watching.  ""O"" is a remake of ""Othello"" of course.  With the teen age cast and the Shakespear's timeless story, this movie could be as big as ""Save the Last Dance.""  STLD got 90+ million at the box office and ""O"" looks to pass it.  Anyway I highly advise that you check out the few other movies that Ms. Stiles has done, you will be impressed.",993513600,8,602,4.2368421052631575
1663639,4,B00005U8EL,"""O"" sets the tragedy of ""Othello"" in a modern high school where Odin James, the only black kid in a high school full of rich white kids, has been brought to the school for his skill on the basketball court.  He is about to lead his team through the playoffs, and he has recently won the love of a dean's daughter, Desi.  However, the coach's angry son Hugo is also on the team.  Neglected by his father and overshadowed by Odin, Hugo forms a vicious plan, resulting in a bloody and all too familiar disaster.

The filmmakers pull no punches and opt for a fairly straight adaptation, doing an admirable job of staying true to the Shakespeare's plot and characters while avoiding his language in favor of an entirely original script. Though rap music, guns, drugs, cars, and the basketball court do figure into the story, these modern trappings never overshadow the human drama. Director Tim Blake Nelson lets his camera tell the story in a refreshingly simple manner, refusing the typical gimmickry of modern cinema; and a very solid cast carries the story well. Josh Hartnett as Hugo is perhaps the most outstanding--his angsty Ivy League face, reminiscent of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, always captures the bitter essence of his character.

Though the film was completed in 1998, the release of ""0"" was repeatedly delayed due to the rash of high school shootings in the late 1990s. While it is understandable that such incidents of youth violence should make film studios cautious, this is one film which stands apart with a mature and timeless message about hate and the seeds of tragedy.",991008000,79,1599,4.8

1663778,3,B00005U8EL,"The movie O, and the play Othello are very similar. O did a good job portraying the play Othello and made the play make much more sense. Watching a modern movie of a Shakespeare play written in old english is much easier to follow along with. The plot of both were very similar, the only difference was that the movie was a lot easier to fathom.
  The main thing I like about Othello is the descriptions and helpful information we get to understand the characters motives and feelings. In this book especially, grasping the main causes for why people want to hurt another person is very important. In Othello, the reader knows exactly why Iago wants to kill Cassio and we know why he wants to break up Desdemona and Othello. In the beginning of the play when Othello is lost at sea, Desdemona worries if Othello will return and Othello fears he will never see Desdemona again. This sweet scene in the play shows the love between them. Another thing special about this play is that Shakespeare told us many things that in the movie one would have to figure out; furthermore, the reader knew Roderigo very well, but in the movie the viewer has to figure him out. We knew Roderigo was jealous of Othello and we knew why started to help Iago. In the movie Roderigo is seen as this weak victim of a bullying situation and doesnt really help Iago like he did in the play. I also really enjoyed watching the movie because it did not follow everything in the play. In the book, Brabantio wakes up to the harsh voice of Iago and is informed by Iago that Desdemona has eloped with Othello. That greatly differs in the movie; moreover, Bob Brable, father of Desi,  is told that Odin has raped Desi. The way Cassio dies in the movie is much more interesting than the books end of Cassio. In the book Cassio is made governor of Cyprus, which is boring. In the movie, he is shot twice by Roger, which ultimately kills Cassio and in the book Cassio is just wounded. When Odin is furious about Desdemona cheating on him with Cassio, his anger is perfectly shown in O with the basketball dunking contest. When he breaks the backboard and shoves a little boy, the viewer can see anger radiating off of him. The movie also did a great job of showing these two scenes: the handkerchief scene and the scene where Cassio was talking to Iago about Bianca. When Desdemona could not find her handkerchief in the play, the movie did a great job of showing how mad Odin was at Desi. When Cassio came to Iago and was talking about Bianca, Othello thought he was talking about Desdemona and was furious. In the movie, Odin was raging in anger after he heard what Cassio said about Desdemona.
 I did not like the length of Othello because the play went on and on about not important stuff. The book talked way too much about Bianca when she did not have that much of an impact on the plot compared to other characters. At times, I thought the movie made Odin look too angry and mean. The book did not show Othello extremely outraged, instead it told us some things about Desdemona that made Othello angry. The characters in the movie were also confusing to connect with the play which is annoying because movies derived from Shakespeare plays are suppose to make more sense than the play and are suppose to have easy connections with the characters from the play. The movie should've had more interesting punches to it because the movie was really boring at some times. The movie should've done more with Iagos father and Desis father because they are both powerful men that could have done much more to the plot of the movie.
 Overall, I give the play a 7 and the movie a 6. After watching the movie O, I realized I really enjoyed the Othello more. I prefer the play Othello over the movie because the movie didn't have anything extra that would make it better than the play. The play had more interesting punches, which the movie lacked. Also, the movie did make me understand something I hadnt understood in the play when I was reading it. I enjoyed the book Othello more than the movie O and would recommend it to anyone looking to read a sad tragedy.",1449792000,3,4125,4.47277556440903
1663779,3,B00005U8EL,"I have always been someone who likes watching something more than reading it. The movie O was not much different from Othello, but it was adapted into a more understandable scenario. The main thing that makes Shakespeare so hard to read, is his use of language. Watching a movie makes things a lot easier to understand, especially when it is set in the 2000s. I liked the seriousness in the text of Othello and it made the severity of the play more extreme. I think the movie O lacked that. Since the movie was set in such a relatable way, with high school students, the movie was easier for me to understand. On the other hand, I think the fact that it was written with such a modernistic approach, made it lose some of the drama of the written play. When Oden is playing in the basketball game and loses it, I thought that it was harder to understand why he was acting the way he was in the movie. I also did not think that the relationship between Hugo and his dad mirrored the relationship between Iago and Barbantio in this movie. I think in the text, Iago seemed more jealous and more wanting of Barbantios affection, than in the relationship between Hugo and his dad in the movie. The coaches power was lacking and I felt he did not have as much authority in the movie, as his equivalent does in the play. Another thing to mention, is that the racial tension in the play is much more prominent than in the movie. Maybe they had to leave out a lot of the racial comments in the movie for obvious reasons, but I definitely thought that the racial tension was not as strong as it is in the play and it should be highlighted because this is a huge reason of why Othello acts the way he does. Oden, portraying Othello in the movie, is seen as way more popular than Othello is in the play. Oden is seen as the cool kid and liked by all of his peers. Othello is seen as more of an outcast in the play, and is rarely seen as a cool character. Overall, I do like watching movie interpretations, but it sometimes confuses me on which things are from the movie, and which things are from the original text. I am a visual learner, so I understand things better when I watch a movie or video about the topic, rather than just reading the text. I would say that ultimately I choose watching the movie interpretation, over reading the text, especially with Shakespeare. One must be careful though when choosing a movie to watch, because sometimes the movies interpretation can lead the reader astray from what is actually happening in the original text. I did not get too confused with the difference between O and Othello and I think that was largely due to the setting of the movie, versus the play. I would recommend reading the original text and watching the movie adaptation, because I did get a better understanding of what was being told in the text, but do not let yourself blend the two plots together, because they are usually not the exact same.",1449532800,2,2948,4.4010989010989015

It stirred a hunger within me to reread Greek mythology and associated literature.  At the same time brought about a personal reflection and gratefulness to not live in a modern day world depicted by this film.

The acting is pretty decent, and the plot is easy to follow as you can't help but watch the demise of Odin (aka, Othello). If you're interested in Shakespeare adaptations, then you'll enjoy this movie. It obviously doesn't do the real play true justice, and some of the music and language used gives the film a different vibe than that of the play, more hostile and somewhat urban I'd say.

""O"" is a retooled version of the tragedy of Othello that's set in South Carolina. While dialogue and locations have been altered, all of Shakespeare's intrigue and violence is intact.

SYNOPSIS--
'O' (or Odin) is an African-American star basketball player at a nearly all-white Southern boarding school. The coach's son Hugo (a teammate) is jealous that Odin gets singled out for recognition and that his dad admits he thinks of O. as a son. When Odin freely shares the top player award with best friend (Michael) Cassio, Hugo plots to bring them both down and to destroy O's relationship with girlfriend Desi.

I tend to watch movies to see how stupid they are such as Garbage Pail Kids, Gigli, and Battlefield Earth. So I decided to see this movie to see how stupid it was and it succeeded in that aspect. Mekhi Phifer is a terrific actor, but his performance seemed forced. In particularly his downward spiral. He doesn't capture all the emotions of his character the way John Leguizamo does in Empire. Julia Stiles as the love interest? Are you kidding me? Couldn't they find someone more attractive to play Desi? She's only in this movie to cash in on her 10 Things I Hate About You and Save The Last Dance fame. You know a movie is in trouble when they have a boring actress as a romantic lead. She ruined this movie just like Sofia Coppola ruined The Godfather Part III. Andrew Keegan is another run-of-the-mill pretty boy who can't act his way of a paper bag. That certainly showed in the movie. Josh Hartnett actually did a good job as Hugo, Martin Sheen did a good job as Duke, and Anthony Johnson makes the most of his cameo playing a local drug dealer. It's an intense role for Johnson in comparison to the very goofy Ezal from Friday. But those 3 can't save this horrid modern remake of The Shakespeare classic Othello. I know Othello ends in tragedy.

**** DO NOT SHOW THIS VIDEO IN CLASS!!! ****

Luckily I previewed the movie first, but it's not a suitable choice for English teachers.  This movie is ridiculously over-infused with unnecessary swearing... It's like swearing just for swearing's sake.  I'm no prude and can surely appreciate some strategically inserted cuss words to drive home a point, but this movie just swears to swear...

Secondly, there's a quite graphic and steamy love scene thrown in here with Desdemona having a full out 5 minute orgasm in slow motion. (Ohhhhh, THAT'S why the movie's called 'O')  Dont get me wrong, it was a hot scene, but again, not something I'd ever feel comfortable showing a group of high school kids. You'd certainly be fired if the principal came in while this scene was on!

THE BOTTOM LINE: A really cool modernization of a classic.  Even the characters names are the same; but it's quite disappointing that the producers went for such an over-the-top ""R"" rating, because it could have really been a great, educationally valuable rendition of a popular high school text.",1337472000,2,1204,4.862745098039215

1664143,5,B00005U8EL,"I say original despite knowing full well that this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's `Othello', but this take feels remarkably fresh thanks to convincing portrayals of key characters by talented young actors.  It doesn't hurt that the textural context of Shakespeare's story fits modern-day elements like a glove.

This just works.

In this retelling (or reimagining) we are introduced to Odin James, the star basketball player at a private school where he is the only African American student.  His best friend and fellow teammate is Hugo, the fiendish reincarnation of Iago.  Odin is dating the dean's daughter Desi, a beautiful and virtuous young woman who loves Odin deeply.  Feeling the sharp sting of jealousy, Hugo concocts a plan to destroy Odin by eroding his confidence, planting seeds of doubt that slowly corrode his happiness and provoke him to lash out in, resulting in an end we wish would never come.

I would have never thought that Tim Blake Nelson would direct a film of this nature, and that he would do it so effectively, but the man knows all about restraint apparently since this film is just drenched in it.  That may seem like a misrepresentation, since the films glaring themes are certainly forthright and the film is bold enough to chuck any and all candy coated sympathies to the corner (the film is R rated and earns that rating) but what Nelson does do here is allow the inner manipulations of the characters to strike the audience eloquently, giving them truly felt development and not stereotypical and clich&eacute;d `roles'.  These characters develop in front of us, baring their teeth and showing their true colors magnificently.  The modern twists are also effectively transferred into Shakespeare's prose, allowing the modern elements to take a back seat to the core representation of human emotions, but never allowing the relevance to become lost in the original text.

And then there are the performances, all of which are noteworthy.  Julia Stiles (WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?) was once my dream actress.  In the early 00's she barreled out of the gate with so many promising projects that projected her talent like a beacon.  She did a lot of Shakespeare (not only was she in `O' but she was also in that horrendous `Hamlet' remake with Ethan Hawke and '10 Things I Hate About You', which is not only one of my favorite teen comedies but it is also adapted from `The Taming of the Shrew') and she did it well.  This is no exception.  Her heartbreak is devastating to watch.  As devastating as she is, Mekhi Phifer one-ups her by layering his breakdown with so many emotional lapses.  He really dissects this character flawlessly.  Josh Hartnett though is the clear standout.  What he does with Hugo is remarkable.  He just sinks his teeth into this character, divulging his selfish pursuits with a level of intensity and honesty that allows you to see his own plotting lifting up over his head.  His facial expressions throughout this entire film, but especially in the end as his plan escalates out of control, tell a story as old as time and one that is still poignant today.

Some may balk at a film like `O' taking a classic and reinventing it so severely, but `O' is faithful to Shakespeare's vision and merely makes it increasingly more accessible to today's culture.

Highly recommended.",1300320000,,3335,4.872340425531915
1664144,4,B00005U8EL,"After watching this for the first time all the way through yesterday, I must say what a story, sad but it was intense! The film is wonderfully directed by Tim Blake Nelson and the cast, though over-aged at times, are excellent in this story of Love, Betrayal, Emotionality, Jealousy, Misunderstanding, and Deception. Mekhi Phifer as Odin (Othello) and Josh Hartnett as Hugo (Iago) are perfectly cast and both stole the entire show. This film may be hard to watch for some and is not suggested to younger viewers, but overall its a hell of a film.

1664172,5,B00005U8EL,"Shakespeare's ""Othello"" has undergone many adaptions.  Perhaps this fact is due to the timelessness of the themes which transcend all centuries; jealousy, deception, and betrayal.  Shakespeare had a knack for exploring relevant themes.  ""O"" is a modern-day adaptation of the best of The Bard's plays.
Set in a private school, ""O"" revolves around the school's basketball team.  Odin is the star player, much to the anger of the coach's son, manipulative and unscrupulous Hugo.  The story also focuses on Odin's love for Desi, the Dean's daughter.  Hugo will use his supposed friendship with Odin to plant seeds of doubt regarding Dessi's fidelity.
This movie is unforgettable.  It is very disturbing when one realizes how young the characters are supposed to be, which proves that no matter what the age, young individuals have to wrestle with their baser instincts just like everyone else.
All of the performers are exceptional.  Mekhi Phifer is unsurpassable as Odin, showing his pain and anger in a totally sympathetic manner.  Julia Stiles is not the best performer in this movie, but she does fairly well as Dessi.  Rain Phoenix, (I hope this is the right actress!) is wonderful as Emily, Hugo's girlfriend and ultimately his tool.  She, like Emilia in the original ""Othello,"" is very smart and realizes what is going on.  Josh Hartnett is wonderful as Hugo, and even shows a human vulnerability to an otherwise despicable and irredeemable character.  His ""love"" sceen with Emily is very frightening as he exhibits his ultimate control.
This adaptation provides a commentary on the absence of adults in these teenagers' lives.  For instance, Hugo acts the way he does in order to receive attention, which he does not receive from his aloof father.
This movie will remain with you after the final credits have disappeared.  I was thoroughly impressed with how closely the director stayed with the original play.  Even snatches of Shakespeare's dialog is reworked into modern language without robbing them of their original meanings: ""Iago: How poor are they that have no patience. What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Hugo: Why is it you rich kids don't have any patience?  Good plans take time to work"" (Hugo's lines are slightly paraphrased because of some profanity).
I would recommend watching this movie in conjunction with the reading of the original play.  Also try the modern adaptation by Andrew Davies, starring Emmann Walker and Christopher Eckleston.  This British adaption, although taking many liberties with the plot of the original play, nevertheless examines the universal themes in an unforgettable manner.",1206921600,2,2631,5.177304964539007

I'm sure some think it's profound, but frankly, it's pretty heavy handed.  I'm teaching at the college level so *can* show it, but it's uncomfortable enough that I don't.  Well performed, but aside from that, it relies on and perpetuates stereotypes of black sexuality, violence, drug use, etc. much more than the original without anywhere near the character development that makes the original interesting.  From a pedagogical standpoint, I can use it as an excuse for a discussion on constructions of minoritized identity, which is fine and dandy, but then it's not doing its job as a companion piece for Othello to help them deepen their knowledge, except in the most superficial ways.  If I wanted to do that, I could assign the old black-face Orson Wells version.  As well, I'd rather just assign some James Baldwin if I wanted to discuss constructions of minoritized identity.

As a film, it's a good way to waste an evening.  I'd suggest renting it, though I did buy it because I'm also a Mekhi Phifer fan.  His acting in the role is much better than the material he is given.",1182729600,8,1260,4.7695852534562215
1664175,3,B00005U8EL,"O (Tim Blake Nelson, 2001)

It seems as if everyone's taken a tip from Kenneth Branagh and decided to do a Shakespeare adaptation recently Tim Blake Nelson tackles Othello, updating the setting to an exclusive high school. Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), the school's star basketball player, spends most of his time in the limelight, and the time he's not he spends in a secret relationship with Desi Brable (Julia Stiles). Odin's best friend, Hugo Goulding (Josh Hartnett), who also happens to be the coach's (Martin Sheen) son, is tired of seeing Odin in the spotlight all the time-- and, of course, also wants to be the guy dating the school's resident goddess. Thus, in true Shakespearean fashion, he contrives an impossibly complex plot to make Odin think Desi's scoring on the side while Odin's off scoring baskets. And, in true Shakespearean fashion, everything that can go wrong does. This is a tragedy. You know that things will not end well.

Now, given the updated setting and abbreviated running time, you know that this isn't Baranagh or Olivier, and O shouldn't necessarily be compared to Olivier (or, for that matter, Welles, who got a tan to play the title role a dozen years before Olivier did). And taken on its own merits, this is a pretty good stand-alone flick. Phifer is on fire in the title role. Hartnett could have probably been a bit more consistent, but when it comes to the climax, he rises to the occasion. Stiles is the weak link in this triangle; she's upstaged by Rain Phoenix, who plays her roommate, in every scene the two share.

I'm so glad that they didn't stray from the book, as most Shakespeare movies do; they keep it true as the author meant. Another great thing about this movie is that it is fantastically acted. Phifer is fantastic as Othello, and puts on screen all the rage that reading just can't act out. His anger, as written in the book, is portrayed very, very well. And Julia Stiles also is fantastic as his lover whom he loves, and with whom she loves just as much, yet can't do anything about the unknown false information that Othello(oden) is being fed. He's suspicious and she has no idea why. if only his jealousy wouldn't have gotten so far, but it did...

  What's so true about the movie, and book, is that the one who does wrong always gets off the easy way. Everyone dies but the criminal, everyone faces his punishment, yet the irony is the criminal is the one that faces no pain. IT is amazing irony. Good movie",1098144000,,1086,4.3399014778325125

1664193,5,B00005U8EL,"Modern directors have found a way of connecting great literature to younger audiences by putting recasting the context -- this is not a corruption, for indeed Shakespeare and other literary giants have had their work adapted for the times, and for different times, on stage and screen numerous times.  Perhaps the best comparison here is the adaptation of the French 'Dangerous Liaisons' to the modern, urban 'Cruel Intentions'.  One of the best places for playing out unbridled passion isn't the corporate boardroom or courtroom or political venue, but the intensely emotional and unrestrained world of teenagers and high school.  It is into this context that director Tim Blake Nelson (also known for his acting in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and 'Holes') and screenwriter Brad Kaaya updated Shakespeare's play of jealousy and betrayal, Othello.
While Mekhi Phifer is the title player ('O', actually Odin James, the modern Othello), Josh Hartnett in the supporting role of Hugo (Iago) steals the show.  Odin is a black basketball player in a private, mostly-white southern prep school, in love with the dean's daughter, and the star of the basketball team, setting up rivalries in the team based both on abilities and racial lines.  Hugo is jealous of Odin's popularity, skill and preferential treatment by all, even Hugo's own father, Duke Goulding (Martin Sheen), the basketball coach.  Hugo decides to ruin Odin, his jealousy becoming contagious of a sort to influence his roommate Roger, his own girlfriend Emily (Rain Phoenix), Odin's best friend Michael, and finally Odin's girlfriend, the dean's daughter, Desi (Desdimona, played by Julia Stiles).
This is an underappreciated gem.  The language is not Shakespearean (so comparisons to the recent diCaprio Romeo + Juliet fail here), but the situations are most assuredly from Shakespeare's story.  The ever-increasing layers of manipulation, as situations seem to grow out of control and each seem to take a life of their own, are dizzying and subtle, strong and astonishing.
The direction is slow and steady, as if the very pace of the film shares the slow but deepening growth of Hugo/Iago's dark desires.  The styles of the southern prep school, the soundtrack shifting from urban rap to darkening orchestral backing, and the earnest performances of the actors all combine to make this a stunning piece.  The ending, both the planning by Hugo, manipulating others into his intentions, as well as the actual ending is surprising but understandable.  Human emotions remain constant across the centuries.
There was controversy given the high-school context and violence in this film, and it was shelved for several years, having completed production for release about the time of the Columbine High School shootings.  The fears of comparison were overblown, as the situations in this film are very different.  Released in 2001 to theatres, it serves as a reminder to modern audiences of how earnest and passionate teen-age emotions can be, and how timeless and universal darker passions such as jealousy can be.",1086825600,6,3070,5.253578732106339

1664195,2,B00005U8EL,"Kids love abbreviations. That's probably why the masterminds behind the teen movie extravaganza based on Shakespeare's ""Othello"" decided to rename it ""O."" Why try to keep a young audience interested for those five extra letters, whatever their symbolic value might be. Symbolism? That is so four centuries ago!
 If the improvements over Shakespeare's work had stopped there, though, one might wonder what the point of creating this film might be. Fortunately, the overhaul is exhaustive. For one thing, Othello, who is now named Odin without explanation, no longer fights in an army, but plays on a basketball team. After all, are athletes not our modern gladiators? GENIUS! Also, the scribes behind this screen adaptation took note of the fact that very few modern youths would become engaged at the ripe young age of 17, at which Desi (Desdemona's new moniker) and Odin (Othello's name... for whatever reason) are currently residing. As such, Odin states that he doesn't ""want to run off to Vegas or nothing(sic),"" but that maybe they can ""pretend for awhile,"" as he slips a rubber band onto his love's ring finger. Few could argue that screenwriter Brad Kaaya has anything less than a subtle, genius handle on translating this timeless tale... for our times.
 Sit down. Breathe deeply. There's little doubt that your heart is practically beating out of your chest with excitement over these downright incredible advancements over Shakespeare's ""first draft"" of ""O,"" but you haven't heard the best of them yet, and it would be a shame for you to drop dead from gleeful shock before even having the chance to view this masterpiece. As such, let us fearlessly move on to how Kaaya dealt with ""the Michael Cassio Problem.""
 It hardly needs explanation, but in case you're simply clueless, allow me to reveal exactly what this conundrum constitutes: you see, my dear reader, it's common knowledge that the modern American teenager couldn't possibly care less about his or her reputation. Popularity is a secondary concern. Nothing shames them. They don't spend hours worrying about what others think of them. This is a thing of the past. Alas, though, Michael Cassio, an important character in ""Othello,"" does worry very much about his reputation... fortunately, this script is in the hands of pros, and they serve up a solution that is more than plausible, and in fact speaks volumes about the generation gap. ""Dude,"" worries Michael to Hugo (Iago), ""My parents are going to kill me... they're always talking about reputation."" Of course! He's worried about what his parents think. I wish I'd thought of that. Hugo, then, tells him to ""play by [his] own rules,"" and not worry what his parents think. I'm sure that's an improvement over whatever Iago might have said in the original play.
 Anyone with a head on his or her shoulders would prefer this film version of ""Othello"" to the script cranked out by Shakespeare. It's more visually stimulating, has a younger cast, is shorter, and avoids Shakespeare's fancypants showoffy writing in favor of good old  plain English.

1664198,5,B00005U8EL,"O is the modern day remake of William Shakespeares Othello, a great play in it's own right. The movie is about a young high school student (Josh Hartnett) who is jealous of his basketball teamate (Mekiah Phiper.) His teamate, nicknamed O (short for Odin) is the star backetball player and Josh Hartnett's character wishes that he could get as much attention as Odin gets. So he decides to ruin his life. He decides to befriend Odin, and then lie to him. He makes Odin believe that his girlfriend (Julia Stiles) is cheating on him.
This movie is going to have to go down as one of my all time favorites. Unlike in Romeo and Juliet (a terribly done Shakespeare play to modern day movie) Othello (O) is done very well and deserves alot of credit. The acting, especially Mekiah Phipers preformance was absolutley amazing. The only preformance I thought was weak (and the only part of the movie I thought was weak) was Josh Hartnetts preformance. I don't know I just felt it to be mediocre, and I thought he couldve acted like he was more into ruining O's life. Even with Hartnett's weak performance I must admit the directing was well done. One thing I really liked is the transiton of making this a William Shakespere play in the Elizabethan Age to an excellent modern day movie.

It is simply an awful adaptation.  All of the beauty of the orignial play is lost in the contrived unbelievable resetting of the story.  It feels like a stupid teen movie meets Shakespeare and it results in a movie that just feels wrong.
An easy comparison is to the modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet which many people interested in this movie may have seen.  R&J is an extremely stylized film and alhtough it is modernized, it retains the orginial location and manages to incorporate Shakespeare's beautiful words in some very creative ways.  I am not a huge fan of R&J but it comes off as a very faithful and unique adaptation.  This movie fails in every way the modern R&J succeeded.
I think the best way to watch this might be just to forget that it's based on Shakespeare's Othello at all.  Then the story and acting might be bearable.

1664215,4,B00005U8EL,"""O"" was originally scheduled to be released right after the Columbine High School shootings and since the film deals with violence and shooting in a high school setting it was pulled and not released for another two years.  But like the episodes of television's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" that were pulled in the period following the Columbine tragedy, it is impossible to look at this story and see it inspiring a similar crime.  Besides, did Mirimax (the original distributor, ultimately replaced by Lion Gate) ask schools to stop teaching ""Othello"" or have any of their other releases, which could also be accused of inspiring teenage violence, pulled from video stores?  Somehow, I suspect not.
Obviously the film takes Shakespeare's play and updates it by transforming the story to a Southern high school and its star basketball player.  Within that context I think the biggest change in the dynamic of the story is overlooked, because in ""O"" the big game is still to be played.  In ""Othello"" the war is over and Venice has been saved by the Moor.  This is a significant difference, because in this case Odin (Mekhi Phifer) has the pressures of sports working in tandem with the machinations of Hugo (Josh Hartnett) to fan O's jealousy towards Desi (Julia Stiles).  I admit I have something of a problem thinking that Odin really cares about any woman more than he does about the game, but it is worked into the complex plot that Hugo is weaving toward the story's fatal climax.
There are obvious comparisons to be drawn between ""O"" and other version of Shakespeare in high school dress, such as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (also with Stiles).  Actually the film that came to mind first with me was ""Cruel Intentions,"" another film where the classic plot line seems an absolute natural for being set in a high school, but the performances are justs a bit too stylized at times.  Not that this version does not have its advantages.  Certainly the motivation of Hugo is a lot clearer in ""O"" than what we find with Iago in Shakespeare, and O's final speech provides a fitting epitaph.  By paying attention to the essence of Shakespeare's plays rather than the time, place, or words (several key moments in the film are carried entire by the significant looks characters give one another), ""O"" certainly keeps the commercial viability of such projects intact.
Ironically, I picked up this DVD along with a copy of Shakespeare's ""Othello,"" only to discover that Disc 2 has a restored version of the 1922 silent film of ""Othello"" with Emil Jannings.  Finding that movie was included in this package was certainly a nice treat.",1044662400,6,2669,4.841758241758241

1664217,4,B00005U8EL,"I just watched this yesterday, and after reading some of the online reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if I saw the same film.  I'm probably the biggest Shakespeare fan I know, and I think this film updates Old Willy's story admirably, even going him one better, IMHO.  One problem I always had with Othello is that I never could figure why Iago feels he has to go to such lengths to destroy everyone; in ""O"" Hugo's jealously for his father's attention, coupled with his 'roid rage, make his motivations believable. However, I think you really should be somewhat familiar with Shakepeare's work to truly get the most out of this film.
The film is beautifully photographed and the brooding intensity of the main character is reflected in the murky sensuality of the foggy, Spanish moss-hung Charleston campus.
There are some very good performances, and the film doesn't try to soften what remains, after FIVE HUNDRED YEARS, a very powerful storyline. Mekhi Phifer is very good, Josh Hartnett is excellent, and Rain Phoenix gives a very strong performance.  I thought Julia Stiles was the weak link in this ensemble, however.  Though physically right for the role, (Desi should be the preppiest, whitest girl on campus, and Stiles is a fresh-scrubbed teen-model beauty) Stiles' performance irritated me, coming off as more than a little wooden.  For reasons I can't fathom, she played one entire scene (a two-shot with Phifer) looking just over his shoulder rather than at him.  Did she have cue cards over there, or what?
Note to parents and teachers: This film has graphic depictions of psychosexual violence that disturbed me greatly.  One earlier reviewer is a teacher who showed this to her AP English class; if I did that, I would be fired.  I'm no prude, and Othello is all about sexual jealousy; it is right for the character, but it is probably too intense for many kids under 18.  I wouldn't let my daughter watch it, and she's fourteen. It's an intense film, and a great film to discuss with grownups.  Movies like this prove that Shakespeare has unlimited potential on stage and on screen.",1038700800,2,2100,4.840782122905028

It works perfectly!  This tale of a man, who seems to have it all, betrayed by his friend's jealousy is adapted into a boarding school setting.  Mekhi Phifer is Odin, the tragic hero.  Odin is the star of the boarding school's basketball team, dating the teams daughter, popular and loved by all.  The basketball team's coach, played by Martin Sheen, has told Odin that he is like a son to him, much to the chagrin of his real son, Hugo (played by Josh Hartnett).

He hatches a plan to bring Odin down, deceptively drawing everyone into his web of deceipt.

Well, I was wrong about it being another teen movie.  Josh Hartnett goes, I think, psycho and kills (or is involved in killing) all his friends at his school.  I didn't expect it to be a slasher movie, but that's what it turned out to be (sorry if I ruined it for anyone).

1664250,3,B00005U8EL,"As you probably all know, the movie ""O"" is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespere's ""Othello"" and was held on the shelf two years earlier because of comparisions between the movie and the Columbine shooting. Well, it's been a while and I just rented this movie. Overall it's a fairly good movie, though I had a few bones to pick with it. First off, the beginning scenes seemed a bit ""Choppy"", not flowing together very well. I also think they could've done better in choosing the actor for the character of Hugo. I'm sorry but I think Josh Hartnett is overrated as an actor. No doubt he does have (some) talent, but I just didn't get much of a feeling from his acting...it just seemed quite bland. Julia Stile's acting was good as usual, though she really didn't have much to do in the film. There needed to be more actions regarding race. Everyone seemed to ignore the fact that Odin (O) was the only African-American in the school...which was what caused such controversy in the original Shakesperian play. Another bone I had to pick was background music. Yes they did need to put (some) Hip-Hop in the background but the amount they used was rediculous. This is TWO years ago when Hip-Hop wasn't as mainstream...and at a Southern Prep Boarding School I'm sure they listened to a lot more then Hip Hop. Anyways, I thought the movie got better and more powerful towards the end. I don't mean to be a spoiler, but hey...you'll know ""Othello"" is a tragedy and of course people die in the end. I thought the plot picked up towards the end, and we the audience learned more and more about each character which kept us interested (at first I felt like just turning off the moving it was so boring). In addition there was a lot of imagery...with the doves always enclosed in the circle (of course in an ""O"" shape) with a dark background. I like how there was narration in the beginning and end. Overall I thought the movie was pretty good but I was expecting more then what I got out of it. You'll just have to see it for yourself. At leased it had Julia Stiles who was the best as always!

That being said, however, O with it's tragic ending seems just a little bit unrealiistic in a modern setting.  But it certainly is imaginative to have it set in a modern day prep school with the title role transformed into a black basketball star in an all-white privileged environment.  Unfortunately something is lost in the translation.  Yet the jealousy and deception remain.
And I just have to comment that athleticism is something that just can't be faked on film.  And as much as I admire Mekhi Phifer as an actor his basketball talents leave much to be desired.  Plus the 8 foot rims were a little ridiculous.  Mekhi 'O' gives a credible performance (as he always does) just not over the top.

1664252,4,B00005U8EL,"This is a great update of the play Othello. It's been years since I've read the play, but the silent movie included on disc 2 helped jog my memory some. Comparing the two, it was interesting how closely _""O""_ follows _Othello_.
This is not like _Romeo + Juliet_ where the play was acted out within a modern setting. _""O""_ is a true update - including the language. You have a basketball player instead of a warrior out on the battlefield, a basketball coach named Duke instead of an actual duke, and so on. All of the elements are there even if there are slight changes to names. There may also be some changes with the ending. (I have not reread the play recently.) All of it has wonderful acting and production style. Some of the less major characters are not performed as well as the main ones, but they aren't too bad. Very powerful ending!!
The first DVD has the movie in both letterboxed and pan/scan. The DVD box incorrectly mentions the trailer being on disc 1. All of the extras are on disc 2.
The second DVD includes the trailer, interviews, deleted scenes and a silent film version of _Othello_.
The movie _Othello_ is a nice production of the play, and from what I can remember, it seems to follow the play very well. It appears to have been made on an average budget. The sets look like stage sets - which wasn't too unusual for silent movies. The silent film runs about 80 minutes. However, about 66 minutes into the movie, it appears some frames are missing. It doesn't seem to cause too much trouble in following the plot.

The story itself is a novel twist on Othello taking place at a private school in the South. Class lines, racial themes, etc. are all addressed and neatly packaged in this teen flick. However, the story itself just drags on forever until you want them all to be killed! Really, really putrid acting made it even worse! Reading the original play by Shakespeare would be more fun.

1664255,3,B00005U8EL,"You'd think any movie based on a Shakespeare play would have little trouble making it to the screen. Such was not the case with ""O'"", which is based on ""Othello"". Once the small, independent production was finished, prestigious Miramax Films quickly picked it up for distribution. Then came the Columbine shootings, and since ""O"" updates the violent story to a private high school in South Carolina, Miramax got cold feet and shelved the film. They didn't count on the persistence of Tim Blake Nelson, the director, who sued them. Finally, two years later, ""O"" was picked up and released by Lions Gate. All this fuss was about bad timing, not bad moviemaking. We can, of course, argue that movies overall are too violent. What was Nelson supposed to do? Change the ending of a story written four hundred years ago? Shakespeare's plays have either happy or unhappy endings, never ambiguous ones. ""Othello"" is definitely in the unhappy category; it ends the way it ought to.
This fictional private high school in Charleston, SC may be small, but it has one great basketball team. The star of the team, Odin [Mekhi Phifer] is the only black student. [Remember that in Shakespeare, Othello was the only black man in Venice.] When the team wins the game that allows them to go to the state championships, Coach Goulding [Martin Sheen] lets the whole student body know that he loves Odin as if he were his own son. This does at all please the troubled Hugo [Josh Hartnett], who is not just another star player. He's Goulding's real son. Enlisting the aid of another student, Roger [Elden Henson], who will do anything to get the approval of the school's winners and leaders, Hugo plots to destroy Odin. He tries several things that don't work before he discovers Odin's fatal flaw - a jealous streak that can be manipulated into rage and fury. When he suggests that their good friend, Michael [Andrew Keegan] may be sleeping with Odin's girlfriend, Desi [Julia Styles], a sinister plot is irreversibly set into motion. As is typical of Shakespeare, though, this plot is not as foolproof as its perpetrator thinks it is.
The cast is quite good. Josh Hartnett, often seen in big budget action fare such as ""Black Hawk Down"", gets to display a wide range of emotions. Mekhi Phifer does a wonderful job as Odin. Part of their success can be credited to the director, who is a fine actor himself.
The movie's plot follows Shakespeare closely, but it throws out all of his glorious dialog. This, and the choice of what setting to place the modern story in, are both the strongest and weakest points of the movie, depending on the point of view. It's strong because it presents the story in an accessible way to teenagers. It preserves Shakespeare's astute observations about the cataclysmic results that some emotions [in this case, jealousy] can induce. It shows that violence only begets more violence. The weaknesses, though, almost outweigh the strengths. It's true that the same character flaws that undo a great prince and warrior can also destroy a basketball player, but reducing the grandeur and stature of the characters also reduces the impact of the story. Hugo uses his words to propel Odin into action, just as Iago uses them on Othello. In Shakespeare's version, Iago's words are so powerful that we readily understand Othello's reactions to them. Odin's being so swayed by Hugo's modern lingo makes him seem rather gullible. As a result, that shocking ending loses much of its emotional impact.",1015632000,3,3498,4.860971524288107
1664256,1,B00005U8EL,"This DVD is SO bad! I can't believe that people are overlooking the MAJOR problems with the quality of this disc. The sound is atrocious. This, in my opinion, is due to two factors; bad directing and bad sound editing. First of all ALL of the actors are directed to speak in these hushed mumbled tones that are quite distracting. The cast is constantly speaking in whisper voices. Everything from the opening duet dialogues through to the murder scences are voiced in these hushed tones. This is a horrible directoral choice. Some of this might have been forgivable if the sound editor had worked in looping by raising the volume of the hushed voices. At least make what they are saying audible. I had to watch this movie with the sound cranked all the way up throughout just to make out what they were saying. Even with this, I still missed a lot of dialogue. The  only exception would be when the ""f"" word is used. It seems as though that came through loud and clear in the three dozen or so times it was uttered. Funny how Shakespeare never needed that word to get accross his point. It is a shame that the screenwriter is so talentless that he had to resort to using it so often making it virtually usless for High School teachers who might have been able to incorporate this film into a reading of Othello in their class. I guess that isn't such a bad thing since the movie is completely bad. The sound surprisingly gets a lot better suring the soundtrack moments. Blaring loud music through only to return to mumbled tones. I am not asking for The Matrix in sound quality but at the very least make what the actors are saying something we can make out without the aid of assisted listening devices!
The performances are not all bad. Mekhi Phifer shows rage and jealousy well though because of the mumbling of lines we are never quite convinced. Julia Stiles is a one dementional Desdemona whom we never really feel anything for at all. Josh Hartnett is only average as Hugo (Iago) and he does not turn in a performance that is noteworthy. Martin Sheen is almost laughable as the yelling, whinny coach of the basketball team. His performance is a study in overacting. It is truly a bad performance by a good actor. All the performances are undermined by the mumbling directing and bad sound. I know I have spent a lot of time on this point but it completely ruins the movie.
The only aspect of the movie that works is the original plot. If you are interested in good viewing of the Othello story go back to older versions captured on film. This DVD is frustating and not worth your time.",1015459200,8,2592,4.491525423728813
1664257,4,B00005U8EL,"""O"" is a brilliantly portrayed update to the classic play ""Othello"" written by Shakespeare.  This movie will make your skin crawl because it can be so chilling.  The music at the beginning and ending of the movie both make you feel kind of anxious.
The whole story revolves around three central characters, Hugo (Josh Hartnett), Odin or ""O"" (Mehki Pfeifer), and Desi (Julia Stiles).  Hugo is the self-involved son of the high school's basketball coach.  He wants everyone to love him and shower him with the attention that they give to ""O"".  ""O"" is the high school basketball team's star player and is the coach's favorite on and off the court.  Desi is the girlfriend of ""O"" and the headmaster's daughter.
Hugo is jealous that ""O"" has the perfect life, and doesn't even act like he really cares.  Hugo tries desperately hard to ruin ""O""'s life and finally comes up with a scheme to do such a thing--he must ruin the relationship of Desi and ""O"".
In order to do this, he not only ruins their love lives, but the lives of those around him...and eventually causes the controversial school shooting scenes.  Personally, I don't like violence, but the killings in this are done (in some of the cases) rather poetically.

I thought Jeepers Creepers was the worst and the stupidest movie I'd ever seen.  Anyway ""O"" has the makings of a remarkable film:  great acting, great plot, original cinematography, and some pretty good music.  For the running time of this film, I temporarily forgot that it's a modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello.  Mekhi Pfifer can count this as a milestone and breakthrough film of his career.  This is Shakespeare at its finest and Mekhi carries the movie brilliantly as 'O' (the modernized Othello).  The characters are layered and, unlike many of the films that were released betwenn 2000 and 2001, you're able to understand why things happened the way they did.  You understand why Iago (Hugo - played brilliantly by Josh Hartnett) is jealous of 'O'.  Think about it.  The coach (Hugo's father) seems to favor 'O' more than his very own son.  Julia Styles is both wonderful and beautiful as Desi (an updated Desdemona).  I understand the controversy that surrounded this film.  After all, it was filmed in 1998 and was scheduled for release in 1999.  But, who would want to see the death of teenagers knowing that the real-life tragedy of Columbine High School was still fresh upon the release of the film.  But, the fact that the film still remained current even after it was filmed, edited, and ready for release two years prior to its final release date is a credit to both the cast and crew of this film.  I now own this remarkable masterpiece on DVD and I must say that I enjoy it even more everytime I play it.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that is well-acted as well as well-written whether its Shakespeare or not.",1015027200,5,1798,4.714743589743589
1664259,4,B00005U8EL,"I liked this movie.  I did have a problem with the intensity of the emotions and actions of these young people, however. In Othello, the play written by William Shakespeare, the tragedy is more believable than it is in ""O"" because of the time period and the ages of the characters.  In ""O"", although the acting is quite good by these young stars, I personally find it hard to swallow that this could happen in modern times.  I suppose that is why the drugs and steroids were put into the mix.  I still had a hard time with it.
  In this movie Othello is Odin, known as ""O"" by his friends.  He's the MVP basketball player on a prep school team.  ( Sorry, I can't recall which state, though I know it was down south.) He's also black, though that isn't really a big issue in this movie.  Hugo (Iago) , the jealous foe who poses as Odin's friend,  does not envy him because he's a star and black, he just envies him because he's the star of the basketball team.  Wait though, that's not the only reason. I forgot to mention that Hugo is also on the basketball team.  He doesn't have the talent Odin does.  And here is why I liked this movie so much, Hugo's father is the coach.  Hugo resents his father's feelings toward Odin.  He's proud of him like a son.  I'm guessing that was the major motive for Hugo's dirty deeds.  It's funny though, I didn't hate Hugo as the villain.  I almost empathised with him because the look on his face at certain times in the movie made you believe he was hurting.  I thought before I watched the movie that it would be more about the girl, Desi (Desdemonia).She was just one of the pawns in Hugo's plan.  Very compelling.",1014681600,,1653,4.305194805194805

I had some problems with the logic of this plan, the almost seamless way it all came together,etc. While the movie has some praiseworthy goals (showing how the jock mentality dominates much of high school and can lead to violence in those who feel outside the spotlight, for instance) this one still seemed a bit forced to me.",1014508800,,826,4.696551724137931

Its the story of Odin ""O"" the African-American star of the prep school basketball team who falls in love with a popular white girl who becomes the unwitting pawn of Hugo's jealous lies.

I would have to say this is one of the best of the modern day Shakespeare adaptations.  All the actors are great in their potrayals of the characters.

1664283,3,B00005U8EL,"For starters, if you have seen or read Shakespeare's Othello, then you already know what happens in this film. With that in mind the filmakers have done a good job adapting it into a realistic present day tradgedy.
Odin is the star player of his prep school basketball team, he is popular, dates the girl of his dreams, the coach loves him like a son, and colleges are fighting over him. So what is the problem? The coach has a son, Hugo (sound familiar?) that wants his dad to love him like a son. He does everything his father asks yet Odin was still the MVP. All he wants is a little appreciation. Too bad they didn't give it to him. So angry is Hugo that he unleashes the largest double-cross since Iago double-crossed Othello. It is too good to go on. Lets just say for a while it goes as planned.
There are several major hang ups with this film that can't be overlooked. Unfortunatly some of them are plot spoilers so it would be wrong to go into them. However, this film does raise an interesting question about society, especially our youth. How long should we let people go before we ask is everything okay? See the film and you will understand.
The acting from the young cast is solid and the film looks great. The all rap soundtrack was a little out of place, but it did serve well in some dramatic moments. The story is very solid, but don't forget, Shakepeare really wrote it. And on an additional note, anyone who is affraid this film is in Shakepearian English can relax, it's not.

1664285,2,B00005U8EL,"What do you get when you take a brilliant seventeenth century Shakespearian tragedy about a general who driven to a murderous rage by a deceitful underling into believing his new spouse is unfaithful and set it in a private high school in the twenty first century? A very unconvincing, well meaning, but ultimately average movie. I am speaking, of course, about Lions Gate Cinema's O, directed by Tim Blake Nelson.
The Shakespeare play is, of course, Othello, and the plot is basically as simple as outlined above. But Shakespeare had a way of bringing out all the drama, pathos, and motivation of his characters and their situation. We could understand what made it possible for Iago (Hugo in the movie) to want to destroy Othello (Odin, or ""O""). We understand how Othello could be driven to murder because of his fear that Desdimona  (Desi) is being unfaithful to him with Cassio (Michael Cassio) in the movie. It never quite comes together in the movie.
The reason it doesn't work in the movie is simple: the translation doesn't work. The fact is that a hot shot basketball star is in no way shape or form comparable to a man who is a general in the battlefield. This is high school, and O and Desi have only been dating for four months.  A huge issue in the original play is that Othello is black. Shakespeare really tackles the issue of racism; it's part of Iago's motive. This movie totally glosses over the interracial aspect of the relationship. O seems totally unaware of the fact that he's the only black man on the campus. Everyone likes and accepts him. Hugo's  (played by Josh Hartnett, who may as well have been wearing a curled black mustache) problems with him is the fact that his father (played by Martin Sheen, doing his imitation of Bobby Knight on speed) loves O like a son, and O views Michael, not him, as his right hand man (naming him co-MVP at the end of the season). It also does short shrift to issues of bullying, drug abuse and intense competition in the basketball world. If the movie focused more on these issues it might have worked. Instead, it focused on the romantic entanglements of a group of callow, two dimensional teenagers I didn't much care about.
I thought some of the performances were excellent, if wasted. Mekhi Phifer and Julia Stiles are revelations.  They look to have long futures ahead of them. In fact, it is in part the fact that Phifer and Stiles made their characters seem so intelligent that the movie was so hard to swallow. I just couldn't buy that Odin would fall for Hugo's lies. How does a black guy who has had to bust his hump to get where he is, who must have seen and experienced some racism at some point, not get even slightly suspicious of a white guy who starts slamming his girlfriend and messing with his head just before the state championships? And, I'm sorry, as I said above, O and Desi were dating all of four months. If she's cheating on ya, just break up with her man!  I admired how Stiles tried to make Desi modern and intelligent But, she was really hampered by the plot (which is actually typical of Shakespeare plays - women are really important). She can see this guy getting weirded out, she calls him on it, and yet she doesn't just dump his sorry butt. It was ridiculous. The supporting players were great, as well. I totally bought it that Emily (the talented Rain Phoenix), Micheal (a surprisingly effective Andrew Keegan) and Rodger (a heartbreaking fantastic Elden Henson)
 The best part of the movie was actually the basketball scenes. I was totally wrapped up in the games, even though I knew who would win. And I really liked that the tone of the movie was sufficiently dark, although it did get rather plodding in points. And the symbolism was way too much. This is a top quality entry in the teen movie genre, but when push comes to shove, it takes more than just borrowing the basic plot events to recreate Shakespeare, and that was the filmmaker's goal, they failed.",1011139200,5,3965,4.593220338983051

Watching that movie in front of her aunt was embarassing.  I felt almost embarassed walking out of the theatre.  That movie was deep, dark, and disturbing.  We were both shaking on the ride home.
Besides the fact that it scared the hell out of me, I really liked the movie.  Josh Hartnett's acting was wonderful as he played evil Hugo Goulding.  Mekhi Phifer's acting was pretty good especially near the end.  Julia Stiles was a big disappointment.  In many of her other movies, she was a girl with an attitude.  In 'O', she sat their like a bug, as if she was just watching everything around her.
I would go see this movie again and I'm glad I saw it",1007942400,,786,4.27891156462585
1664288,5,B00005U8EL,"O, a film for the iron hearted.
By Emily Steadman
 Have you ever found yourself so angered by characters that you begin to feel sorry for their behavior? Some of the opening lines set an excellent mood for the film. Who is the real star in this film? Martin Sheen (the basketball coach) draws us to this same question by telling Odin that he loves him like a son. This film is a perfect example of a satisfying frustration.
 O is the story of a black basketball player in an all white preparatory school, who is weaved between the fingers of a jealous teammate, and finds himself doubting his love for his girlfriend Desi.
  The question is, did I enjoy the movie? Well, in a sense you could say yes. Besides taking after a classic Shakespearean play, O was written in such a way that you could relate to each of the characters. The actors had very believable roles, all portraying their characters fluently. However, the flip side to this film is that it was very realistic, very touching and very shocking. I am split down the middle by this movie. One part of me loved it, the other side of me was horrified. This is partly because we are all too familiar with the media swarming over high school violence, like fruit flies attacking a summer picnic. Their point: America scars when it's youth is harmed. But all in all, I give it a THUMBS UP.
  I was astounded by the feelings I left the theatre seats with, because the few catchy comedic lines were just enough to keep me from screaming at the tops of my lungs in agony for these characters lives. Hugo (played by Josh Hartnet) is left behind by his friends and his father, because Odin (Makki Pheifer) has become such a hero with his peers, that Hugo is soon forgotten. Desi (portrayed by Julia Stiles) finds herself less trusted by her father because she is dating a black student. Odin is still a hero in everyone's eyes, but is brainwashed into thinking that his life is crashing down all around him. I felt for  ""O"", because the villain is torturing his mind. However, I too felt for Hugo, because he desperately needed love and attention. As I was sitting in the theatre, I felt so torn between these characters, because I realized that this film was such a well-done portrayal of teen life. The only problem was that the writer weaved in the not so innocent parts of teen desires and hatred.  Through my tears, I was saying bravo to the writer.
I would recommend this movie to those who understand that O is a rewritten version of Shakespeare's tragedy, ""Othello"".  The movie will not leave you with the smiles and perks that 10 Things I Hate About You gave you, nor will it leave you in mystery about what is going to happen next. The violence and racial issues are also clear to the viewers. O is a movie you go to prepared and secure with issues like school violence. Be prepared to handle the tossed events happening in the media, and the emotions that draw you to kiss your children good night. It's a great one, but remind yourself that crying in a theatre is an O.K. thing to do.",1007942400,,3048,4.448028673835125
1664289,4,B00005U8EL,"""O""
  The movie ""O"" is an excellent up to date portrayal of Shakespeare's tragedy Othello, which is why I give it two thumbs up! This movie is intended for teenagers and adults alike, mostly due to its illicit context and demand for a higher level of perceptiveness from its audience. The idea of taking the works of Shakespeare, changing the language to fit with today, and making the setting a high school really works well for this movie. If you have already read the play Othello, you will find this movie very intriguing, since you will be able to relate parts of the play to parts that you see in the movie.
  The movie ""O"" is about a young black man, Odin James, who is brought to an all white school for his ability to play basketball. Because all the students, the coach and the dean's daughter Desi love Odin, he becomes the center for neglected Hugo's jealously. Hugo's father, the coach, is so caught up in being there for Odin that along the way he overlooks his own son. Therefore, Hugo in envy plants untrue stories of Desi in Odin's head to make him doubt her faithfulness and send vulnerable Odin in to a hurricane spiraling out of control. This in turn leads to the all so familiar climax of Shakespearean tragedies.
  ""O"" is satisfying from beginning to end with the outstanding actors that have been placed in this film: Josh Hartnett (Hugo), the master of manipulation, does a superb job as the friendly villain; he puts words to the phrase the villain you love to hate. Tim Blake Nelson shows you the relationship between Odin and Desi in depth to make you feel close to them. The way that Julia Stiles (Desi) and Mekhi Phifer (Odin) flow together caused their characters to become so real to me that at the end of the film I was frustrated and in denial that the movie had ended in such a tragic way for the young couple.
  Tim Blake Nelson does a great job all around on the direction of this movie. The camera angles will blow your mind-- especially the never-ending circular staircase that I believe foreshadows the twisted thoughts of Hugo.
  ""O"" was written as a portrayal of a Shakespearean play, not in response to the high school shootings in 1998--which got the movies release date postponed to 2001. This movie really opened my eyes to the negligence that is bestowed in today's youth, due to their own selfishness. ""O"" left an enormous impact, causing me to think about things that normally people try to avoid. The movie really makes you think about the people who surround you, and how they are treated; which leaves the thought in your head-are you treated better than them, and if so what will be the lasting impact that this envy may arise?",1007251200,3,2679,4.5625
1664290,5,B00005U8EL,"The film ""O,""based on ""Othello""by William Shakespear is very powerful and dramatic film, which keeps you on your toes the entire time. So if you like William Shakespear and tragedies, you will love this film.
  The protagonist, Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), is a black basketball player who is stuck in an all-rich, all-white high school, where he is preasured to lead the basketball team to the state chapionship. Along the way he falls in love with the deans daughter and the most popular girl in school, Desi Bramble (julia Stiles). The antagonist Hugo (Josh Hartnett) is neglected by his father, (The basketball coach) and brain washes Odin to belteve that Desi is cheating on him. In this Hugo devlopes a horrible plan to make himself shine.
  The director Tim Nelson keeps our attion by constantly moving the cameras in an unusual manner. The director or cinematographer portrayed the basketball senses as if they were a war. I think that is one of the reason why he moved the cameras around so much to make it exciting and to keep your attention. The film was completed in 1998 but because of the reasent high school shotings they repeatedly postponed the release util 2001. As a previous high school student I have learned alot about high school shotings by seeing this movie as well as wanting to read ""othello"" again. This movie stands out like a sour thumb and makes you think twice about what kind of impression poeple have on you and you on others. That is the responce I got from most of my peers after they saw it. The only thing that I am saying about this movie is that it is very realistic and in the back of your mind you are thinking, ""Wow, this could happen in my school,"" I think that is one of the reasons why I like this movie so much. The realism of the movie is why I think it got postponed. It will defiantly stick in your mind the rest of the day. I would very much recommend you to go see and enjoy this film.",1005004800,,1935,4.4576271186440675
1664291,5,B00005U8EL,"Kaaya's Oscar-worthy script makes Shakespeare's most annoying tragedy believable.  In the BBC ""Othello"" for instance, Desdemona's so irritating it's a relief when she dies!  Not so with the strong, determined Desi (Julia Stiles).  Though making Desi savvy creates problems with her plot line, Kaaya solves these problems, at least in part, by putting race in-your-face.  Aptly, Odin (Mekhi Phifer) and Desi's strongest love scene happens while they're debating ""the N word."" It's important, I think, that the camera never lets us forget how black Odin is (as films of the play sometimes do) or how racialized envy fuels the plot.

Though all three young lead actors are spectacular, Hugo (Josh Harnett) is literally to die for.  It's Hugo's movie, just as it's Iago's play, though Hugo's motives here are more credible than Iago's.  Drugs account for character change in an insightful, timely up-dating of the plot, and basketball really works as a substitute for the military.  Coach ""Duke"" (Martin Sheen) is a great re-invention of character.
Tim Blake Nelson's film is one of the few re-imaginings of a Shakespeare tragedy that actually plays as tragic.  I saw the film the day it opened and the sound of gunshots was so unsettling that a woman actually jumped from her seat and yelled ""Has somebody been hurt?""

Films rarely move me to tears, but I cried at the end of this one--at the VERY problematic end of this one. I'm ambivalent about the way that Hugo's last ""message"" will be received by the 12-16 age group who in theory won't be seeing this R movie...till it comes out on video.
Do go see ""O""--for its compelling characters, it's strong visual statement, and it's honest portrayal of the fragility of black success in an all-white world.",1002585600,,1751,4.945392491467577
1664292,4,B00005U8EL,"I went to see ""O"" not knowing what to expect. The trailers didn't tell much, and I hadn't read any reviews. I was very surprised with it, considering it hasn't gotten much hype.
""O"" is based on Shakespeare's ""Othello,"" and is a terrific modern remake. It is about a teen-age basketball player, Hugo (played by Josh Hartnett) who is overcome with jealousy for fellow teammate Odin (Mekhi Phifer). Hugo is the coach's son, and feels that he doesn't get as good of treatment because of this. He thinks he should have gotten MVP instead of Odin. He devises a plan to bring Odin down, by telling him he heard his girlfriend Desi (Julia Stiles) had been cheating on him. Once the seeds of doubt are planted, Odin becomes more and more violent, escalating to the horrifying climax of the movie.
The thing I liked about this movie the most is that it is different. It isn't like every other ""cookie-cutter"" movie out in theatres. The acting is wonderful, especially by Julia Stiles. I would defintely check out this movie if you think Hollywood is going down the drain.",1001635200,,1061,4.648936170212766
1664293,5,B00005U8EL,This movie was way better than i thought it would be. All of the actors did a great job and the director was great building the tension. I must also admit that Josh Hartnett was a perfect villian. Go see it now.,1000944000,2,211,4.0476190476190474
1664294,3,B00005U8EL,"This updated, stylized, high school version of Othello, is a frightening examination of jealousy and violence.  The problem with transferring this Shakesperean tragedy onto and into the lives of high schoolers is that it reads (without prior knowledge of the play, which I'm assuming most of the young people whom this appeals to will not have read) as just another examination of misguided teenage violence devoid of a thesis.
The cinematography is beautiful in places, and our new Othello (O) and Iago (Hugo) are well casted and well acted, but the excellent Julia Stiles (Desi/Desdemona) has nothing to do but look victimized and flat. (As in a flat character not flat chested). The racial tension is forced upon the viewer a little too forcefully; I think the screenwriter could have found more subtle ways to show us the animosities there.
This movie is disturbing and violent.  I would recommend discretion in regards to what ages view this film.  It's an interesting adaption, but (and I apologize if I come across as a purist) because the violence is so explicit,and in the end, pointless, there isn't a larger frame of reference to put this in for most people, no discussion afterwards like the reading of Othello in a classroom might provide, that I'm forced to wonder what was the point of making this film?  Do we really need further depictions of young people slaughtering each other?",1000857600,,1397,4.931914893617021
1664295,4,B00005U8EL,"Never having seen or read William Shakespeare's play ""Othello,"" I was unsure what to expect from ""O,"" a film that begins somewhat slowly, and then kicks into a higher gear as the plot thickens. This modern update of the classic play pays a great tribute to the work of Shakespeare, while also featuring some very well-wrought performances and a third act that is disturbing and affecting at the same time.
Taking place in Charleston, South Carolina, at the high-class Palmetto Grove prep school, the film begins with a basketball game as Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), brings the team to yet another victory, while the wildly jealous Hugo (Josh Hartnett) looks on from the sidelines. Odin's fame among his teammates and fellow students, not to mention his stable relationship with Desi Brable (Julia Stiles), the daughter of the school's headmaster, enrages Hugo, who keeps his cool and concocts a plan of earning Odin's fame for himself.
At this point, the actors have proved themselves very worthy of the film's many complex emotions. Phifer is also able to convince us of Odin's inner strength and sense of devotion to Desi, and Stiles mirrors these attributes in her character. The two share a warm and inviting chemistry seen little in films of a teenage nature; this is due in large part to the time the movie devotes to the developing of their relationship. This drawn-out approach may seem a bit tedious, but it serves to better the film by enhancing our connection with these two characters.
It is Josh Hartnett, however, who steals most of the show as Hugo, instilling in him a subtle sense of deception that can be quite chilling. Hartnett handles the material just as it needs to be, in a calm, laid-back fashion. Hugo is the type of person who steps on those around him to get where he wants to be, and for this to work, he must show no emotion over the actions he takes; Hartnett captures this trait beautifully.
As Hugo's jealousy grows, so do his evil plans. He involves many others in his quest for revenge; when fellow teammate Michael is temporarily kicked off the team, Hugo offers a glimmer of hope by suggesting that he get Desi to convince Odin to suggest to the coach that he be reinstated. Hugo then plays on Odin's doubts, filling him with suggestions that Desi may be sharing more than just friendship with Michael.
This begins an increasingly fascinating descent into untruths, deceit, and evil, as each character becomes involved in a final plot twist that will decide each of their fates. This, accompanied by the slowly progressing beginning and middle, make this one of the best Shakespeare reworkings I've seen to date. Everything about the film rings true to his work, right down to the dialogue, which, even in its modern state, evokes the tones and emotions that his original writings also do.
That final act is what almost kept the film from reaching the silver screen. Filmed before the Columbine High School disaster, the film was shelved for fear that it would create a stir after that most brutal act. Seeing it now makes it that much more effective; it takes teenage issues, like jealousy, loyalty, betrayal, trust, and love, and casts them into a light that no other film would dare touch. The violence that permeates the film's ending is gratuitous, yes, but it also serves as a warning sign of just how out of control our society can be.
""O"" can be considered an unconventional teenage film, due to its daring approach, and its success in carrying out that approach in a convincing manner. Its lead actors are able to sell us on the characters they play, while the story itself stays in touch with the many messages embodied in all of Shakespeare's works. At first, I found the film somewhat tiresome; upon further thought, it gains luster.",1000080000,48,3781,4.782874617737003
1664296,4,B00005U8EL,"Not a bad update of Shakespeare's classic work of jealousy and deceit.  The setting has been modernized from the Venetian army to the world of basketball at a North Carolina prep school.  When Hugo (Iago) becomes jealous of the accomplishments of Odin (Othello) he devises a trap to bring him down by having his girlfriend, Desi (Desdemona) break up with him.  Hugo weaves an all-too-intricate plan that becomes increasingly complicated as time  passes and stages of the scheme do no progress accordingly.  As this is of course a tragedy, the lives of everyone involved is either ended or horribly altered.
The acting is superb on the parts of Julia Stiles (Desi), Mekhi Phifer (Odin) and Josh Hartnett (Iago).  An appearance of Martin Sheen as the basketball coach and father of Hugo was pleasantly surprising.  The experience of this seasoned actor was evident in this production that was otherwise lacking in acting talent.  Sadly, the rest of the cast left something to be desired.  Even with the surprise appearance of Rain Phoenix, the younger sister of River, the supporting cast simply did not pull their weight.
Why 4 Stars?:  All things considered, this film is one of the few that is worth seeing in the theatre, though I would recommend a discount matinee as the full-price ticket is a little unwarranted.  The updated setting works well to have something tying these characters together (something Shakespeare was missing).  While the main cast turned out adequate performances their supporting cast needed some more work.",999820800,4,1535,5.0717131474103585
