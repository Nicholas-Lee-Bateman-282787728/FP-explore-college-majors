8557681,1,B000B8IABW,I was attracted to the cover of this dvd - bad mistake. None of the menacing and virile looking warriors even make an appearance in the movie. There are many interviews with people of dubious relevance to the production. There are individuals doing dance sequences who are really not terribly good. Lighting is poor. There is really very little to recommend this.,1174867200,,363,4.870967741935484
8557682,5,B000B8IABW,"I have seen a lot of Doc's and most are very good, but Battle Night has to be the best in a long time. Very well Directed, and an exciting pic to view. Pick this up to see for your self.",1132012800,,186,3.5609756097560976
