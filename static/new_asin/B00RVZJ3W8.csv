6936066,3,B00RVZJ3W8,"Lots of twists & turns so it keeps you guessing however my two main flaws with this movie are:

1) ""The Lady in Black"" is a super misleading title. Why this movie is called this & why that picture with the girl is a total mystery. Doesn't fit in a single way.

2) The initial set up of this movie is quite farfetched. If you have a knowledge about a crime before it actually happens, why in the world would you go to the cops with details they haven't even found as a 'good samaritan'?",1462752000,,485,4.094736842105263
6936067,2,B00RVZJ3W8,"So I did watch the whole movie.  I'll start with the positive.  I think I liked the plot and it was suspenseful.  This movie was just kinda sloppy.  They spent too much time on unimportant things no one cares about and not enough time on the reason your watching it.  Im confused by the title and the dvd cover featured.  The main character is just a terrible actor and really was just trying way to hard.  Music was cheesy. I wasn't surprised by anything, I mean, you didn't have a lot of choices as to where this movie was heading.  Honestly, I thought everything was ok and if maybe they had used a different actor the reviews would be more positive and I'd give more stars. I will say, I was obsessed the entire movie with finding out what the heck was in that drawer his girlfriend nailed shut!",1461283200,3,799,4.315436241610739
6936068,1,B00RVZJ3W8,I made it 5 minutes into the movie... The acting is flat and just blah.,1459555200,2,71,3.8
6936069,1,B00RVZJ3W8,don't waste your time watching this stupid movie.,1458259200,,49,5.25
6936070,2,B00RVZJ3W8,Very amateurish production.  The camera appeared to be on auto focus with it focusing on whatever it decided to focus on and sometimes not focusing on anything. the sound level was also erratic.  At times it looked like they were using a cellphone to record this movie.,1458086400,5,269,4.702127659574468
6936071,5,B00RVZJ3W8,Great psychological thriller. Fast and efficient service. Had me wondering who the killer was from the beginning. Awesome twist. Great interrogation scene between the two actors!,1443571200,,178,5.884615384615385
6936072,4,B00RVZJ3W8,Really good movie. Thank you,1434758400,,28,4.8
6936073,4,B00RVZJ3W8,"Thought I better write a review since there are none to be found on this movie anywhere. I bought it on a whim cz I heard some samples from the score that were amazing (I'm weird that way) and had to see what it was about. It is very well directed and interesting. It's a mystery story that has a man bugged out cause he is dreaming of people being killed and then they are. It pulled me in and had good characterization and twists to keep me guessing along the way about how it was all gonna end, and who was ultimately responsible. I have to say I was a little disappointed in the ending, only because I was hoping for a different answer, but I am also thinking there might be more to the ending than I thought and I'm gonna watch a second time to see what clues I can pick up along the way that I may have missed. So all in all a good movie if you like more artistic thrillers. It was originally called The Window, so it is not a ghost story or any sort of movie that has a Lady in Black in it. Just a way to repackage to coincide with the release of woman in black 2. But that's just the studio so don't hold it against the movie.",1429401600,4,1134,3.9563318777292578
8696045,1,B00RVZJ3W8,"From the first scene it comes across like a B movie with a low-quality script. The conversations feel forced. You're given no real reason to root for the protagonist. The character actions have no clear motivation. The character emotions make no sense (why would you be upset that the police don't consider you a suspect in a murder??). The directing wasn't much better. The camera angles hold zero drama to help build tension. Every scene feels staged. Even simple things like a news broadcast are wrong. (News anchors never hold the page when they're reading it.) It was a nice try, but a wide miss. I would recommend this to film students as a study in what not to do in a horror movie.",1515542400,,689,4.564516129032258
8696046,3,B00RVZJ3W8,"So the title is actually incorrect. On IMDB the movie is listed as ""The Window"". Not sure if this is an Amazon error or what. That said, it took me awhile to follow the plot and timeline. Worth a watch, but definitely no Lady in Black here.",1501372800,,240,4.127659574468085

8696048,1,B00RVZJ3W8,"If I could give less than a star I would. Don't get this confused with the ""Woman in Black"" as this is nothing like it. The production is amateurish and the storyline was pretty awful, I waited around to see what was in the nailed shut drawer.. Total let down. You wait and wait for a blah ending. I was waiting for the lady in black to appear..  Never was one. Not once in the movie was there even a mention of a lady in black or anything to do with a haunting of any kind. The DVD cover is completely misleading and has nothing to do with the movie. I don't know if it was a misprint or what but I highly suggest watching the Woman in Black movie over this.",1484697600,,659,3.992424242424242
