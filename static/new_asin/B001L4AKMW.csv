8317148,3,B001L4AKMW,"I am a fan of the never modest, Jorge Sanz and was attracted to the film, OVIEDO EXPRESS after I saw a preview online.  Also stars Carmelo Gomez as womanizer in the first degree and follows the drama of a theater group in Spain. Dialog in Spanish with no subtitles, but the story is easy to follow although you miss much of the humor if you do not speak the language. I give it a 3 stars. The acting by some of the top notch Spanish film stars of today make it worthwhile.",1294012800,2,472,4.075268817204301
