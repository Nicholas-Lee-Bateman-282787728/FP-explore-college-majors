The story begins with a song while the credits roll. Cowboys herd Hereford cattle. [Too many for this small herd?] Does a cow steal the scene between Gabby and Miss Jan? ""Ricky is drowning!"" A St. Louis newspaper is sending a reporter to Hereford Heaven. A modern diesel-electric engine with a ""Railway Express Agency"" wagon stops in town. The reporter detrains. An old printing press publishes their small weekly. Paying a bill with chickens. Editor Rogers gives reporter Connie Edwards a ride to the ""Flying T"" ranch. Sam Talbot made a will two months before his accident. Orphan Duke Lowery inherits the bulk of the estate! [Implications about his parentage?] Is there a clue in an old hymn book? [Who there reads it?] Are Jan and Steve in cahoots? ""They can't prove anything.""

Then there is a song for the audience. Shots ring out, two men outside Duke's window shot at him! They are pursued. One man is shot dead. Who is he? Tom Center was known to the sheriff. Will reporter Edwards go to jail? There is a song at the Breakfast Club. Duke rides Sam Talbot's white horse. What frightened this horse on the trail? Connie finds a clue about the time of death. Deboriah heard a whistle. Was this around the time of death? The Coroner doesn't like being questioned. The fight has some comedy. ""We shore did."" Jan learns what happened at the Coroner's office. The Hereford bulls are auctioned off at high prices. The men search for Duke. Jan deals with the undertaker. Can Roy and Gabby arrive in time to save Duke? There is a chase for action. Shots are fired at the Holloway ranch. There is a final conversation between Jan and Steve. Then Jan talks to Roy and Gabby. Can Roy catch the train and Steve? The sheriff arrests the guilty. Ricky recovers. There is a song to end the story.

Gabby has a more important role in this story. Roy Rogers played a wider range of characters in his movies. The use of a murdering villainess seems unusual for this series. Was it inspired by ""Double Indemnity""? Murder for inheritance was rare in this series.",1409270400,,2077,4.623306233062331

8028046,5,B0002HODTK,"One of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans best. A very special treat in that it was filmed on location at the Lazy L Ranch near Davis, Oklahoma. Roy and Dale were married here at the end of filming in 1947.
When Dale is thrown in jail you don't know whether to laugh or cry.
You'll get a bang out of this shoot 'em up!",1272931200,2,309,3.84375
