8092984,5,B000BVARDS,"Game Center CX DVD-BOX was released on December 23, 2005. Here's my DVD review.
The very first box set of Game Center CX/Retro Game Master contains the first two volumes on two discs in its own cases inside this Famicom themed case.

Volume 1:
Star Force (NES)
Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels (1986) (FDS/NES)
The Mystery of Atlantis/Super Pitfall II (NES)
Ghouls 'n Goblins (NES)
Transformers: The Mystery of Convoy (NES)

Volume 2:
The Japanese Arcades at Daily Shoppers
Prince of Persia (SNES)
Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES)
Shin'nya Arino's Reactions

As you can see, the first volume intrigues me because the last 2 episodes on that disc, Ghouls 'n Goblins and Transformers: The Mystery of Convoy have eventually gotten reviewed by The Angry Video Game Nerd along with Super Mario Bros. 3 from Volume 2. The SMB2 episode of GCCX comes in handy especially when it comes to that one familiar trick that was already seen on World 3-1 of the first SMB.",1495929600,,953,4.728915662650603
