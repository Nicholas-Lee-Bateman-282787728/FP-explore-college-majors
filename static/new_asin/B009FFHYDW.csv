5324134,5,B009FFHYDW,I am a huge fan of Bob Harper! His workouts are always challenging for me and I would consider myself a fairly advanced exerciser. Sometimes the Biggest Loser videos are only so-so because while I enjoy Bob's portion the other instuctors are just fair. But Dolvett Quince is just as good in this video. Definately adding to my rotation.,1362355200,2,336,4.711864406779661
5324135,5,B009FFHYDW,"I love all Biggest Loser exercise DVD's. Just another one to add to my vast collection.  Love the show, love to workout with them too!",1361923200,,134,4.36
5324136,5,B009FFHYDW,"I love this workout! The warm up and first two segments are the best, the third segment with Bob is not my favorite (only because two of the four exercises I can't do). I have most of Bob's DVD's and love all of them, I just wanted something different to switch up my workouts. This is very comprehensive and challenging and Dolvett is terrific. It is just the right workout for those who need something that's not too long, but can do the job and get you sweating. I will probably make my own modifications with the third segment or skip on to the cooldown. Thank you!",1361664000,,569,4.327102803738318
5324137,4,B009FFHYDW,"I own just about every single Biggest Loser and Jillian Michael's workouts. This one is by far one of the most challenging (and I love it!). There are several different workouts but all are challenging. I wore a heart rate monitor while doing the workouts and on Bob's ""All About Reps"" workout on this DVD, my heart rate got up as high as when I was doing the Insanity workouts. If you're looking for a workout that is challenging both cardio and strength training wise, this is the one! (The only reason I didn't give a solid 4 stars is because the dvd makes you choose your workouts one at a time. So you can't select a warm up, work out and cool down all at once. You have to select, then do the workout, then select another...but that's my only gripe with this dvd).",1360713600,4,770,4.317241379310345

I have never watched The Biggest Loser but have many of friends who do and love it! The Biggest Loser Power Ab Blast. The name alone scared me because I am not allowed (as per my doctor) to do ab focused exercises but was able to do much of the DVD and thought it was great. The warm up was  great, even the planks and core exercises  were easy for me to modify for my compromised belly. Nothing was fast paced and I would love to have Mr. Fitness Teach (the hubby's new name) try it out as well to see what he thinks now that he is sporting his six almost 8 pack belly!",1357516800,,589,3.9327731092436973

There's plenty of anaerobic work that gets my heart rate up and really works my muscles, without hurting my joints.

5324175,4,B009FFHYDW,"I have almost every Biggest Loser DVD, so when I saw this I had to have it too.  I love these ones that allow you to customize the workout (you can select any variation of the 3 workouts + warmup and cool down to play).  I think you can tell Dolvett isn't quite as comfortable or natural in front of the camera as Bob, but he does an OK job.  The first 15 min workout is an alternating 1 min cardio - 1 min strength workout with Bob.  Bob is the best - motivating and cute all in one!  It goes quick but its tough.  The 2nd workout is with Dolvett and is more plymetrics and strength.  He ends his 15 min segment about 1.5 min early and does some cool down moves in this 15 min segment.  The 3rd ""all about reps"" workout is crazy.  You do 4 rounds of 4 exercises - each exercise a minute long and you get a minute break between rounds. But it is HARD.  You're supposed to try and out-do yourself each round.  I found myself doing worse each round, which was a bit frustrating.
All in all, its a good and different workout for the rotation.  Not one I will do everyday, but I will fit it in once a week or so.",1397779200,5,1108,3.9638009049773757
5324176,5,B009FFHYDW,"This is a seriously hard workout! I like how they break it into 3 workouts so you can work up to doing all 3. Great interval training! It's annoying they don't have a ""Play All"" option, tho.",1395187200,,190,4.162162162162162
5324177,4,B009FFHYDW,"I started doing biggest loser workouts in high school and they helped me drop 20 pounds over the summer. I like that the workouts are not done by fitness models who never look winded or take short breaks. THIS is real people working out.

As for this DVD specifically, Bob kicks butt for the first segment (as always). I hardly ever have to take breaks when working out but I did for this one! You don't get breaks which gives it an extra element of difficulty. Dolvett's segment wasn't as challenging cardio wise but it was challenging for my thighs! My legs and abs burned like no other. Dolvett is such a sweetheart and cute! Very motivating trainers and I will definitely be coming back to this workout.",1391817600,2,707,4.5234375
5324178,5,B009FFHYDW,I have worked very often with Bob's DVDs but it was the first time to work out with Dolvett! Loved both workouts; they are very different but very effective and motivating.,1389657600,,172,4.580645161290323
5324179,4,B009FFHYDW,"I really love this video. It pushes me to work hard although, because of my arthritis, I need to modify some moves. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to ramp um their workouts.",1388448000,2,190,4.305555555555555
5324180,4,B009FFHYDW,"I like this DVD but it is more advanced beginner or intermediate. You will definitely sweat; I also love the music on this one. It makes you want to move and groove for sure. Once again, Bob Harper is the one who really makes you sweat or want to snap! I nearly try to get through it. He also messes with Ramon, but he lost a lot of weight on this one compared to ""Calorie Knockout"" DVD by Biggest Loser too. He also cut that beautiful hair he once had.

This one doesn't really offer modified moves except with Bob...

I was surprised I made it through this one. I borrowed from the library and hope to get in the future. Dolvett is the one that keeps me moving!

5324187,5,B009FFHYDW,This workout will definitely make you sweat! Even though the actual workout only lasts 15 min you are dripping by the end. Great workout to rotate through your week. I rotated a number of the biggest loser workouts and do a different one every day. I like the fact that they don't build off each other like some of the other biggest loser dvds so you get sick of the workout.,1372118400,,375,4.295774647887324
5324188,5,B009FFHYDW,I have several Biggest Loser/Jillian Michaels workout DVDs and this is one of my favorites.  I defintely work up a sweat.  All About the Reps is the hardest with all the burpees so I usually do that one by itself and do the other two together.,1369958400,,243,4.260869565217392

5324190,5,B009FFHYDW,"This is my first ""Biggest Loser"" DVD and I purchased it because it offered three different work out options, and included a warm up and cool down that you could do in under 30 minutes. It has become my favorite workout as it REALLY works you out. The warm up is a very good start, then you can select from three different 15-minute workouts, and then end with a good cool down. Their approach is lower key than Jillian Michaels (who I love and have three of her DVDs), but they work you just as hard. I am in relatively good shape, and I was definitely sore after. The exercises are easy to follow and do not need much thinking in terms of coordination.",1368835200,2,653,4.274193548387097
5324191,5,B009FFHYDW,"This is not an easy routine, it will challenge you daily and make you really get back into shape in no time flat. I am the type of person that gets bored easily with DVD workouts, but this DVD and the episodes within it kept me engaged and motivated to keep coming back for more. I have been finding that even though I have been using this now for a few days I am still getting winded and tired after every workout (and I am not in the worst of shape). One of the things that I liked was that the videos are short, but pack a ton into the time that you have to workout. One other thing that I will add is that I used to use more intense workouts that were harder on my body and I find that I am getting just as much of a workout with this without the constant pressure on my body (which is a nice change).

I think these workouts are just a little boring. They just seem to move so slowly. They just seem to lack personality. That being said I do sweat quite a bit and feel sore usually the next day.

5324201,5,B009FFHYDW,"I own about 7 or so work out videos. They all give me a good work out, but this video wins the prize for total body sweat! I typically do the Warm Up, Metabolic and Power train as my custom work out, and for a 35 minute work out I really feel it. Each exercise is only 1 minute long but the pace is fast and you end up working out your entire body. I have been working out steadily for about a month and a half and I still get my but kicked by this video. I highly recommend this work out program. And the ""Its all about the reps"" part is a great fast 15 minute work out if you don't have the time for a full 30. In a week or so I will brave adding all three parts as one long 45 minute hardcore work out but I just don't feel ready yet.

Lastly, I can contribute at least 5lbs so far to this video alone since I started using it two weeks ago. Well with a proper diet of course. I have lost more weight faster with this video then even with the P90 and all without the aches and pains that comes from the P90. I can not recommend this video enough, and I really hope they come out with a more advance version in a few months when I should be ready for it.",1363132800,56,1156,3.796680497925311
5324202,5,B009FFHYDW,"I have several other workouts from The Biggest Loser brand, and this one has quickly become my favorite!  The video consists of 5 separate workout segments--a warm-up which is 5 minutes; 3 working segments, which are 15 minutes each; and a cool-down, which is 5 minutes.  You can select any combination of these 5 segments to build your own workout.  The first segment (with Bob) and the second segment (with Dolvett) are similar in format.  They go quickly from one move to the next, each move lasting only one minute.  They alternate between cardio moves and strength moves, which does a great job of keeping your heart rate up.  One minute increments may not sound like much, but as you near the end of each minute, you will be sooooo glad to move on to something else!  I also like that during the second segment with Dolvett, there are a couple of exercises for abs--most of the other Biggest Loser workouts don't really work your abs.  The third segment (with Bob) is different--and hard!  You do 4 high-cardio moves (1 minute each), followed by 1 minute of rest.  You repeat that twice more, for a total of 15 minutes.  This segment is a little bit boring, since you repeat the moves, but it really gets your heart rate up!

What I really like about this video is how easily you can modify the moves to meet your fitness level.  This isn't a choreographed routine, so you can go faster or slower than the people on-screen.  If you need a harder workout, add propulsion, use heavier weights, and move faster.  If you need easier, do the opposite!  I don't think I would want to do this every day, but it's a great one to add to my workout rotation.",1362614400,40,1654,4.5

8540959,5,B009FFHYDW,"Very effective workout! I love this workout. I own many of the Biggest Loser workouts and this is one of my favorite. Bob teaches two of the segments and Dolvet teaches the other one. If you cannot do lots of jumping and high impact moves, one of the segments may be challenging but Bob shows modifications for the moves.",1496880000,,321,4.4576271186440675
8540960,3,B009FFHYDW,"I've done Bob's own video workouts and found them to be very interesting and effective. This one is ok, but not as good as the other 3 Bob Harper videos, or the Jillian Michaels videos for that matter. I do Bob's beginner workout, cardio workout and ""the hardest workout ever"" and lose myself in the workout. This one, not so much.",1492473600,,331,4.442622950819672
