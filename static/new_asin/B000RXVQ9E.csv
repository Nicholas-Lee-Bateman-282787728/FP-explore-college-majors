8202878,5,B000RXVQ9E,"This DVD is challenging for children's ages 6-8. There are geography, spelling, trivia facts and other questions, including ones for the parents.  It's a fun game to play as a family.",1396396800,,183,4.903225806451613
8202879,2,B000RXVQ9E,"I'm glad I bought this secondhand (read: cheap). We're fans of the Brain Quest cards and have used them on many occasions while waiting in Dr. offices, traveling, etc. By the description I expected more of a ""game"". All it is is a voice reading aloud the questions and answer choices, and you scroll through the answers with the arrows on your remote and select the right one. It's pretty boring. My daughter is 8 and in 2nd grade. Some of the questions were off-the-wall hard and others my 5-year-old could answer. They're kind of all over the place, which I guess keeps it interesting. She says she likes it but hasn't gone back to it again.",1358121600,3,643,4.504273504273504
