7875072,2,6304622813,"I ordered a very rare DVD so I'm not completely shocked it was not in ""like new"" condition and if it isn't fine but don't list it higher just to make a sale. The disc showed up in a CD jewel case instead of a DVD case which isn't a big deal just not what I expected when ordering, but the worst part was the disc hadn't even been cleaned before shipment so there were fingerprints all over both sides of the disc. These were easily cleaned off with Windex but that shouldn't have been my problem.",1339459200,,496,4.123711340206185
7875073,5,6304622813,"Ladies and Gentlemen, you have found it. The cream of the crop! This kung-fu flick has got to be in the top 5 of the greatest kung-fu movies ever made. This film has everything: unbelievable fight scenes (with the snake and crane styles), hilarious slapstick and a cocky jackie. I would give this one 6 stars if i could. Trust me, one of the best! The dubbing is pretty funny (jackie's voice is hilarious) and the storyline is pretty good too. (for a kung-fu flick) This one is a little harder to find, but if you come across it, don't you dare pass it up. you won't regret it.",987465600,5,577,4.302752293577981
