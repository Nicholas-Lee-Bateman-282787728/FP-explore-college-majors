The Moving Mountain Range (A-): Orphen takes in America as it's military. Yuu, Hime and Nakki are captured by Chinese villagers and they visit a Brain Powered graveyard.
The Governor's Ambitions (A): Kant tries to pilot a Brain and the American Grand Chers are destroyed by ""Brain Ghosts"".
A Problem of Hallucination (A): Hime finally talks to Orphen and the Americans commence a nuclear missile assault on Novis Noah.
All or Nothing (B+): Yuu brings his sister to Novis Noah where she actually settles in gardening with the children. However, her Grand Cher has other plans.
Sweet Memories (B+): Baron takes over Orphen while more Higgin's past is revealed.
Tricking Memories (B): Quincy Issa steals Hime's Brain in order to find her own Grand Cher. When she finds it, she discovers the history of the Isami familty.
Orphan's Hesitation (A): The Brains make a final assault on Orphen and Quincy lets Orphen swallow her.
Flight (A+): The rest of the Brains are transported back to Novis Noah while Hime and Yuu are left inside Orphen to fight Baron. Plus, Baron's identity is revealed.
The packaging, like the last volume, contains key terms that should help you understand the show better. The extras on this volume include a production gallery of the Brains and Grand Chers and the continuation of the interview with Yoshiyuki Tomino and Yoko Kanno from the last volume.
Overall, I was rather pleased with the ending to Brain Powered. It remained true and original right up to fanatastic ending that didn't slow the show down one bit. If you have never seen this series, by all three volumes right now. It is well worth it. Brain Powered is a fresh mecha series that should appeal to every anime fan. Highly recommended.",1035331200,2,1992,4.7936046511627906
