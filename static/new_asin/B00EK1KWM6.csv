WONDERFUL soundtrack, some amazing outfits and struts, weird weird humor and plenty of satire.  Fans of John Waters early work and 70s sleaze will most likely enjoy this fun and dirty movie.  Its filled with good parts. I actually reviewed this movie for my show! check it out! Major Spoilers! [...]",1377475200,,441,4.615384615384615
8606218,5,B00EK1KWM6,"This is an audacious and bizarre film. An exquisite souffl of disemboweled coke addled snuff film creators and psycho clowns. Watching this movie is like being sucked inexorably down a slaughter house drain pipe. Gobbets of blood and flesh and severed nipples fly past you at the speed of light. The soft thwock sound of a meat hook penetrating delicate back flesh becomes your new lullaby. But you can't sleep because each sick moment reveals something progressively more twisted. The cavalcade of sheer gonzo grotesqueness sears your eyes and ears and lobotomizes your brain leaving you speechless, drooling and laughing hysterically like vincent price on magic mushrooms. Highly recommended.",1376524800,3,694,5.376146788990826
