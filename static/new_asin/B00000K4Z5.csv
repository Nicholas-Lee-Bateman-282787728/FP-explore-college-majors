7914295,5,B00000K4Z5,"I'm a huge collector of anime. Tenchi in Tokyo was a collection that I started in the early 2000s, but I couldn't find many of the discs once they started doing box sets. Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,567,4.2592592592592595
7914296,4,B00000K4Z5,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.

In this DVD the girls begin to drift apart. Realizing that Tenchi is in love with Sakuya, they lose hope. Only Ayeka and Sasami remain. Ryoko returns to piracy, and Kiyone & Mihoshi are back at headquarters. Washu as usual is there, but far away. Things are getting gloomy at the Masaki house, an it's up to Ayeka and Sasami to fix it. But Tenchi is focused on Sakuya and doesn't seem to be to concerned with the situation.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1165,4.490566037735849
7914297,4,B00000K4Z5,"Ryoko, hurt and feeling betrayed, returns to a life of crime, while Kiyone and Mihoshi are promoted to Headquarters.  Washu has become so obsessed with her research that she even ignores Ayeka and the rest of the household, what's left of it.
Yugi and her minions are winning.  The family is breaking apart and as each person leaves Yugi becomes more and more delighted.
Even Sasami and Ryo-Ohki break away, feeling Ayeka has gone insane.
Soon Yugi will win...but what does that mean?  What will happen when she wins?  And has Tenchi become too involved with Sakuya to care?",1087603200,,574,4.767676767676767
7914298,2,B00000K4Z5,"Unlike some Tenchi series this one just stinks. The animation is horrible. I'm sorry to diss it this bad but it's true. This is, in my mind, the worst Tenchi series yet... I can't really find anything really good about this. I'd recomend Tenchi Universe or better yet the Tenchi OAV series. The people who did this one didn't do so well with the animation. The plot is acceptable but I've only seen these few episodes. It was very hard to get into.",1010188800,,448,4.409638554216867
7914299,4,B00000K4Z5,"I'm writing this review because the last one gave it a low rating because of the depressing parts of the series.  I think that a film that effects  you emotionally in any way is worth a lot.  This series is filled with  heartache and romantic confusion, and it even involves a couple of very  sweet scenes between Tenchi and Ryoko.  I nearly cried when I realized that  the Masaki family really was going to drift apart. In all, I would have  given this series 5 stars.  The only thing keeping it from being five star  material is that the artwork is terrible.  I can onyl guess that the  artists are different fro mthose who worked on Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi  Universe.  Sasami has red and black eyes, and Ryoko's face has completely  changed shape!  The story also differs slightly, in that Ryo-Oki now seems  to belong to Sasami, and has little to no connection with Ryoko. But please  don't let that deter you, if you are a fan of the Tenchi series, by all  means, buy this now! If you're just starting out, this series may give you  the wrong idea, I suggest beginning with either of the first two series.",969408000,3,1109,4.422885572139304
