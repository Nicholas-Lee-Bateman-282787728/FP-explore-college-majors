5895275,2,B00E8G5H2S,"The original movie was much better than this. A very weak plot, the Vampire is not in many scenes and He seems to be tossed in the mix. The dialogue between actors was boring, contrived, and not delivered well at all. There was some nudity and one lesbian sex scene, however there was no real sense of relationship between the young female actors, just thrown together scenes that were not interesting at all. It seemed like every actor just appeared suddenly and read their lines, no edge, intrigue, passion etc. A really boring ending as well, nothing we have not seen 100 times before in countless other movies.",1382054400,2,614,4.694444444444445

5895278,3,B00E8G5H2S,"I'm a fan of vampire flicks so was disappointed that there were no reviews on this soon to be released (writing this a week before release) straight to video movie... so I did a little research and got the basics.

This is a remake of a 1995 movie of the same name. IMDB shows 4.1 stars for that one. Descriptions for both films are about the same. 18 year old good girl starts college and gets involved with a vampire. Sex, nudity and minimal story. I'll take another look when the price drops A LOT (currently 25 bucks for Blu-Ray).

Since writing the above I've gotten negative comments for posting general info from other sources. I was just trying to be helpful. Won't do that again.

Meanwhile, watched the flick. Even worse than I expected.",1381104000,7,747,4.518518518518518

5895291,4,B00E8G5H2S,"Overall, the remake is not as erotic as the 1995 original with Alyssa Milano & Charlotte Lewis.  However, the Charlotte/Sarah love scene in the remake is far more sexually explicit than anything from the original.  In fact, it's far more explicit than any girl-on-girl love scene I've ever seen in a mainstream movie (with the possible exceptions of ""Bound"" & ""Femme Fatale"").",1436486400,,376,5.048387096774194
5895292,4,B00E8G5H2S,"This reboot is in a whole different league than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Embrace-of-the-Vampire/dp/B00FN7MHGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Embrace of the Vampire</a>&nbsp;(EV95) that came out two decades ago, and not just because contemporary film has a number of advantages. In case you missed EV95 (I wish I had), it featured a silly vampire who was on an inexplicable 3-day deadline, and of course the real reason most people watched: television star Alyssa Milano's implants exposed. As I never have and never will care about Alyssa Milano, I'll try to be kind by giving EV95 credit for daring to do at least a couple of things I'd never seen in a vamp film: [1] a neck bite done thru a net (I think it was a soccer net) and [2] a vampire licking a door for about a half-minute (granted, the door had blood on it, but it was still one the most ridiculous things I have ever witnessed in a film that was not intended to be absurd).

PROs
 Actors. Don't be surprised if you recognize some of the faces. Victor Webster: Carlos of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Continuum/dp/B00HUPC5UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Continuum</a>.

Ryan Kennedy: Josef of Defiance, Odin Sinclair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caprica/dp/B0057YFYP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caprica</a>. Chelsey Reist: Harper of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-100/dp/B00ONEM9MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 100</a>. Destiny Rumancek of Hemlock Grove. Most of the actors have been in numerous TV shows. As for the protagonist of Embrace of the Vampire 2013 (EV13), relative newcomer Sharon Hinnendael did better than you might expect for a contemporary B movie. I'd have to see her in another production to be sure, but it seems she can act... or in the least she can act like a melancholy, socially awkward girl.

 Cinematography: very well done. I wasn't expecting such high production values.

 Location: The story opens in Eastern Europe and EV13 seems like it's trying to fool you into thinking the whole thing is in Europe, but this was a Canadian production (you guessed it: British Columbia).

 Plot: it's a vampire flick, what do you expect? You don't need to be a rocket scientist to follow it, but EV13 is better than the cover art suggests. Who is the vampire? You don't find out until the second half, and that's a good thing. The innocent Charlotte (Hinnendael) is tormented by some ""mean girls"" ( la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B006MNH0DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers</a>) of the fencing team, which will admittedly bore many viewers who want action rather than character development; I found the mean girls implement (a classic horror mechanism) effective, as it provides a reason to bond with the protagonist.

 Strong female protagonist in the spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-tvS/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy tvS</a>. It took her the whole movie to get there due to loads of self-doubt, but she eventually became someone to root for... where's the sequel? EV13 probably put a dent in Hinnendael's career, so she might as well reprise the role.

CONs
 Horror tropes abound, making this a ""vampire plus"" film. I prefer my vamp movies with a little less random horror imagery and a little more vampirism. At least blood was a key component of these sequences.
 The plot was sufficient to hold my interest, but it doesn't break any new ground for a vamp film (although I'd never seen one before EV13 that centered around a fencing team).
 The ending. Fades to black just because they couldn't think of something clever to do after the central conflict resolves. Not bad per se, just lacking in creativity or even closure.

--
 Reboot? Yes, it was. Both movies open with a scene in the Old World and the same vampire antagonist, and both have characters named Charlotte, Chris, Nicole, Eliza, and Sarah. Both Charlottes were found passed out on campus after dream sequences. Both Charlottes have trouble during lectures. Do I need to go on?

 Sex. Yes, but very little. Despite the cover art suggesting ""soft-core,"" that would be a misnomer considering how mild and infrequent the erotica is in EV13. There was one tame female/female scene (~3 minutes), and the protagonist remains still a virgin when the closing credits roll. If you like boobs (not pornstar fakes, mind you, but real ones), then you've come to the right place.

 The vampire is the Buffyverse (Joss Whedon) type, i.e., face can be either regular human or true ugly... plus makes a growling sound during attack (I never did like that about Whedon's vamps).

 Funny things not intended to be funny. The female ""students"" of the cast were presumably supposed to be typical twentyish matriculants, but the casting choices made this impossible to believe unless these students were at the end of some kind of part-time 12-year program (Sharon Hinnendael is the saving grace for credibility here).

 Final Verdict  I may be giving it more credit than it's due because of [1] the occasional titillation, [2] Sharon Hinnendael's allure, and [3] Victor Webster playing a major role, but EV13 did keep my eyes open even through the closing credits.",1434153600,7,5579,5.766138855054812

No, the film does not mirror or match the story or eroticism of the original, which I frankly had some problems with as well. Forgetting that and taken on its own, it is a good entertaining vampire flick. It could have used a little more background to help build the story, such as why Sharon Hinnendael has the dreams and visions that pop up out of nowhere.

5895308,2,B00E8G5H2S,"This was one of those movies that I really wanted to like, but wasn't due to its shortcomings with the writing and uneven pacing. The story did have a nice twist to the Vampire story, but it got lost in the ho hum story somewhere between naps.
This Vamp story was based on a student that lost her mom in an auto accident a couple years ago. Charllotte (Sharon Hinnendael) is an honor student with a full ride scholarship and under tremendous pressure to succeed. With the pressure come strange visions and flashbacks that are interfering with school. work and a possible love connection. During these flashbacks we learn that her families history dates back a few hundred years where all of her trouble originated. These little events happen to often for me and at times do little to explain Charlotte's problems.
It was hard to feel very much empathy for Charlotte because of the way she interacted with others and the poor character development regarding her predicament.
The story has the usual problems that plague todays students like hazing, jealousy, alcohol, bullying, teachers lusting after the student and being shunned for being so everything.
The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the locations and the landscape cinematography of Quest University in B. C. Canada and the surrounding mountain ranges and was real close to giving this one 3 stars because of the GOOD production values that are the Saving Grace of the movie. The other Saving Grace is the attractive cast and a few good performances by some of the cast.
The movie does contain a fair amount of sex scenes with a fair amount of female nudity. The foul language was a lot less than expected and I can't remember if there was an f...word thrown in or not? The movie also has some hazing binge drinking and a few scenes of tame violence including decent gore/blood (knife, bite and spear wounds to the neck and torso) effects makeup.
I really can't recommend this movie, but I will say the locations were worth it for me.",1398470400,,2006,4.701704545454546

She is despised by the fencing team captain (Olivia Cheng), but is loved by Chris (Ryan Kennedy) Sarah (Chelsey Reist) and her fencing instructor (Victor Webster) who all want in her pants. Charlotte is clearly our dysfunctional Buffy who also suffers from hallucinations, bad dreams, and a gypsy (Keegan Connor Tracy) who needs to talk to her.

The vampire aspect is small. We don't find out who the vampire is until an hour into the film. Most of the film centers around Charlotte, her job, her hazing, and her locker room discussions. The film has gratuitous nudity which includes a stripping/drinking hazing scene as well as some girl/girl action that would be classified as soft core porn.
