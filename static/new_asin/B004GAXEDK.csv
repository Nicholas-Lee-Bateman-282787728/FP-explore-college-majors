8428575,1,B004GAXEDK,"North American buyers beware!  The product description is inaccurate.  It's advertised as an NTSC Region 1 disc, but it didn't work on my North American DVD player.  The DVD case says it's Region 0, and while it's not indicated on the packaging, I believe it's PAL.

One-star rating is for Amazon's labeling of the product, not the DVD's contents themselves.",1325808000,,358,4.916666666666667
