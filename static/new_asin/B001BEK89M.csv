3491139,5,B001BEK89M,"I still hear comments about this video's ""Tourmaline"" episode -- because I'm in it!
I was among the very fortunate rockhounds invited to the filming of this episode at the Himalaya Tourmaline mining claim in San Diego County!

I have been there multiple times, and WOW! have I seen some incredible tourmalines found in the ""tailings pile"" brought down from the mine site!  (These tailings are brought from the mining claim area and they are not ""picked over"" -- you pay a flat fee and you get to ""move as much dirt"" as you want from the tailings pile, and whatever you find there is yours to keep!)  How great a deal is that?!

[For the record, the Himalaya is no longer hosting trips to the actual mine site itself (without special arrangements with the owner of the mine). However, they operate a very good ""dig"" at the Lake Henshaw Resort/Campground in eastern San Diego County, just a few miles from Julian, California.  For many people, that isn't a ""negative"", but a ""plus"" as you don't have to contend with some of the ""critters"" (snakes, scorpions, etc.) as well as the steep slopes on the claim itself as the dig area at the Lake Henshaw resort is ""nice and flat""!!  Much better too is the fact that kids can come and they really have a great time digging (and are usually pretty darn lucky at finding ""the good stuff""!)]

I have found some pretty great tourmalines there...and I highly recommend this ""dig"" for ""kids of all ages!",1280361600,6,1439,4.575875486381323

8283013,4,B001BEK89M,I love this show & was sad to see it taken off Travel Channel's line up.  This doesn't have all of Kirsten's episodes but it's got some good ones.  I'd really like another DVD offered of Becky Worley's season.,1374019200,,209,4.333333333333333
8283014,5,B001BEK89M,LOVE THIS! LOVE KRISTEN! only ONLY complaint-where is season 2?? the out takes are fun at the end of each show.,1368489600,,111,4.333333333333333

8283016,3,B001BEK89M,"I thought this was going to be SEASON one. It turned out to be season two, which I already have. That was disappointing, and somewhat misleading, but it was my mistake because I didn't read the description of the episodes carefully. So I gave it to a friend. I'd really like to get the first season DVD.",1323648000,,303,4.333333333333333
8283017,5,B001BEK89M,"I like this DVD.  I always liked the show, now I am glad to see it on DVD.  DVD is a lot more portable than DVR formats or on demand that can only be played on limited media.  also DVD supports stereo and true suround sound.  blue ray would be a nice addition for this DVD.",1304985600,,273,3.8214285714285716
8283018,5,B001BEK89M,"I watched the different shows and now I'm turning emerald green with envy and my face is turning ruby red in embarassment at being envious. Before I turn sapphire blue from holding my breath too long, I'm just going to say that it was wonderful seeing all the shows one right after the other. It was easy to move around the shows and see or skip things. The quality was fine--what more can I say, except that I wish the shows had been hour shows instead of half hour shows. For an armchair prospector like me, the shows themselves were treasures!",1302566400,,546,4.415841584158416
8283019,5,B001BEK89M,"If you missed the series this DVD would be a good pick for you. It is comprised of past episodes starring Kirsten Gumm. However, it is not all of the episodes she starred in. In that respect it is disappointing. It is a good review for treasure hunters and rock hounders.

It shows actual on the scene collecting from some popular rock hounding sites and mines
open to the public and some private collection areas and fee areas.

Kirsten collects Herkimer diamonds in New York, Morel mushrooms, copper and agates in Michigan, turquoise in Nevada, tourmaline, fire agates, and jade in California, petrified wood in Oregon,
Dinos in South Dakota, gold in Alaska, emeralds in North Carolina, ginseng in West Virginia and
Star Garnets at Emerald Creek, Idaho.",1296777600,10,755,4.890625
8283020,5,B001BEK89M,"Just knowing the treasures that are out there on our green earth, and on top of that in the U.S. just waiting for us to extract it and admire it in its entirety. I can watch this a hundred times. It's exciting and I'm ready for it.",1295136000,,231,3.9361702127659575
