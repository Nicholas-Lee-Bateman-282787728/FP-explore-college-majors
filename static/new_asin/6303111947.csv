572609,2,6303111947,"Routine, familiar stuff this is, but the utter predictability is agreeably leavened by Republic's atypical shelling out for some pricey location shooting (flat California pine forests above San Bernardino) and a diversely animated cast. Rex Allen gallops Very Fast and croons a mean campfire ballad, Slim Pickens provides amiable comic relief, and Louise Beavers definitively steals the show in its repeated attempts to undermine her considerable dignity and geniality. William Witney, a practiced veteran at B-movies, directs the proceedings with some dispatch, in a slightly offbeat story of timberland insect infestation. There's actually a faint sense of woodlands responsibility and stewardship here, in a modest film predating Nick Ray's WIND ACROSS THE EVERGLADES by some six years. (Rex' nemesis is venal timber queen Carrie Hurley, favoring ecocide and clearcutting, played by June Vincent, iceblonde femme fatale of the 1940s noirs BLACK ANGEL and SHED NO TEARS.)

Allen, wicked Vincent, Beavers and Pickens alone make this worth your attention, a painless viewing experience and a great alternative to pricier, more pretentious and less entertaining Westerns.",1399248000,,1170,5.724137931034483
572610,5,6303111947,"Good westerns are very hard to find on DVD format so when I seen this I got it for my sister and she says ""It the best old western that she's seen in a long time.""",1377561600,,163,3.5555555555555554
572611,3,6303111947,"This film has all of the looks of an ""A"" film.  Picture quality keeps this from being a 5 Star film.",1366588800,,100,3.761904761904762
572612,5,6303111947,"Entertaining Republic musical western with Rex Allen and a good cast of character actors.  Other than being a little jumpy the first minute, overall this is a pretty good DVD presentation.  This Roan edition is by far the best with no splices and is complete.",1269129600,2,259,4.733333333333333
572613,1,6303111947,"I was really enjoying this movie,then the dvd ended before the  finish of the picture. The last eight minutes of the movie are missing from this dvd.  Do not buy this dvd.",1062806400,3,171,4.3125
572614,2,6303111947,"This looks like a transfer to DVD from a blurry VHS EP mode source. The picture quality detracted from the total enjoyment of the feature. The sound was also flat. You can only improve the film quality a tiny notch inspite of all the adjustment you make on the TV set. But since this is the only one available on DVD for this Rex Allen film, I suggest you get it. Very atypical of Alpha to come up with a release of this quality.",1054512000,4,429,4.119047619047619
572615,4,6303111947,This is the best movie for people who love these old time westerns Slim Pickens always has the charm to please the audience. If you like the 50's westerns this is it BUY IT!,950572800,3,173,4.117647058823529

7839154,4,6303111947,Can't do anything but enjoy Rex Allen westerns. The stories are a notch or two a above others made in the early 1940's and are a little more violent but great songs and recognizable characters in leading parts.,1428710400,,210,4.552631578947368
7839155,5,6303111947,"What can I say but that I just love all these old cowboy movies Rex Allen is awesome as is Rocky Lane among a umber of other fun action cowboys.
Great time filling stuff and time well spent IMHO",1426204800,,194,4.0

7839157,2,6303111947,"An acceptable story line, but could have been better.  It brings to mind the question, ""What happened that Rex Allen just dropped out of sight with an occasional voice for Disney products.  He had a wonderful full base voice and could really sing well.  But he just disappeared out of movies.  When I was a kid and we planyed cowboys and Indians I always wanted to be Rex Allen.  I loved his horse Coco too.  An unusual color for a horse.  I think Coco was theonly one I ever saw with that color.",1418083200,,496,4.268817204301075
