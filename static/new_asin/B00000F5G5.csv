1202327,5,B00000F5G5,"This really is a bitter-sweet love story. The story begins with war scenes and the near Death of a soldier. During the life saving surgery,there are several rather unusual events that forshadow future events. The whole story seems to revolve around the 50/60's paranoia of the unknown or communist invasion/subversion,then the story then becomes a mystery as more people are searched out for sinister and or unexplained  abilitiesduring theinvestigatigation it is  noticed that severly ill or hurt or damaged children are dissapearing. The ending is a beautiful and actually unexpected.",995241600,,586,5.5
1202328,5,B00000F5G5,"This, the only 2-part episode of classic Limits, demonstrates once again how good this series was at presenting spell-binding scifi entertainment, even with the second season's lack of a special effects budget.  Additionally, it beautifully showcases the warmth and humanity of the Stevens/Stefano vision that gave life to the series, even after its creators left.  But there is nothing sappy here; it is only after a harrowing and tense story build-up that the audience is delivered to its final affirmation of virtue and human worth, which resides as much in the alien as in the human, despite a wide empty space between them, and the alarm and fear that rush in to fill that vacuum in the meantime.  The theme of this episode is that sometimes, understanding can come only after a passage through fear and suspicion.  From the start, the intrigue mounts, wonderfully elaborated by an excellent musical score with the oboe carrying a deliciously tense melody against an ominous ostinato.  Robert Duvall deserves top honors for his portrayal of an FBI-like agent in charge of defending the country from what he astutely perceives could be an alien menace, against the somewhat more unwitting sensibilities of his otherwise competent colleagues and J. Edgar Hoover-like boss.  There is some enjoyably hardboiled dialog and some very taut scenes in which things seem to come to a head, only to be neutralized by the determination and apparent invulnerability of the alien intelligence, whose uncertain motives and objectives are the axis on which the plot turns.  A lesser storyline might have highlighted the paranoia and idiocy of Duvall's character, automatically thinking that the aliens' intentions must represent a threat to humanity; but instead we are directed sympathetically toward the potential, if flawed, heroism of his stand.  Duvall's zero-dialog portrayal of Boo in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" must have been a good warm-up for the last scene here, in which he is virtually struck wordless by the final story revelation.  Likewise, the four human hosts of the alien force (with strongly contrasting personalities) are poignantly portrayed, deeply conflicted about the alien presence within them, which even they are powerless to confront.  Perhaps the most dramatically gripping exposition of this theme is a lonely scene in a church, with one of them praying about it in a state of profound spiritual angst.  This is not the kind of thing we see routinely, even in the best science fiction.  It once again puts Classic OL in a category almost by itself for high class and excellence.  There are flaws in terms of production; such as the Vietnam setting's inauthenticity, but this was made before folks new what the SE Asian countryside looked like from news footage airing later in the 1960's in American living rooms.  Likewise, the ship built by the alien concern is not to study closely.  But these flaws are as though insignificant against the top-form story, direction, acting, and overall audience engagement.  If you like solid, non-juvenile science fiction drama, if you resent and despise the shallowness and vapidity of the ""Independence Day"" standard for such fare that passes in today's product-market, you might really enjoy this memorable OL episode.",991094400,6,3276,5.1878557874762805
1202329,5,B00000F5G5,"Four soldiers are shot in the head in battle and develop superhuman intelligence and mind control abilities.  Working independently and without even being aware of each other's existence, they use alien technology to invent four devices which when assembled will take themselves and a shipload of crippled children to another galaxy. A government investigator, played with sinister earnestness by Robert Duvall, reporting to the highest levels of the U.S. government, suspects Communists (not by name) but finds himself always one small step behind in foiling their plans.  He finally catches up with them moments before they complete construction of the spacecraft.  The surprise ending is worth waiting for the story to unfold.  In fact, the waiting is the best part. The story is convincing, the pacing is excellent, and you won't want to leave the room for a second. I don't think there is a bad episode in the whole series, but this is one of the best.  There is also something about black and white film that deepens your fears and darkens a mystery.  I enjoyed this episode, the only two-part, two-hour episode in the series, so much that I bought it. I watch it a lot because it makes me feel that the unknown is full of good things.  If you worry a lot about your future, so will you.",980553600,,1293,4.797297297297297
1202330,5,B00000F5G5,"This is one of my two favorite ""The Outer Limits"" episodes. I was dismayed when I viewed it and discovered that it was edited. This was a 2-part episode. Missing are the end credits of ""part 1,"" the flashback introduction to ""part 2"" and the opening titles to ""part 2."" Anyone being an enthusiast of this series my also be dismayed that these pieces of film have been trimmed.  From an artistic standpoint the deleted introduction was so well edited that it not only summarized ""part 1"" but it enhanced the viewers curiosity and increased the suspence as to how the story was going to unfold. The deleted introduction indicted and connected particular events that the viewer may not have been cognizant of. This edited version seems flat.",973728000,3,738,4.765625
1202331,4,B00000F5G5,"The Outer Limits show from the early sixties was one of the follow-on programs to Rod's Twilight Zone. Centering primarily on SF topics, the episodes tend to be bizarre and surreal.
There are one or two chapters of  the series that stand above the rest (at least in my opinion) ... 'The  Inheritors' is one of them.
This particular episode is also longer (being  in two parts -- both parts included on the VHS tape) than any of the others  I've seen. However, it is much more 'believable' and interesting.
The  tape copy is clean and clear (B&W as the series was aired), sound  quality is good.
The basic plot is: four unrelated soldiers (in Viet  Nam?) are critically wounded in the head with bullets made from a  particular meteor. The meteor is, in reality, a message from another world  which gives each of the four special skills and abilities above the norm.  It forms a 'second mind' in each of its recipients. One of the four becomes  a physicist, one a biochemist, one a metallurgist, and the last (and key  character) a financial wizard.
Each in their own way are guided by the  alien intelligence and contribute in the construction of a special craft  which will be used to transport handicapped children (those who never had a  chance in this world) to another, better place -- a second chance.
Our  main character is pursued by the 'science police' in the guise of Robert  Duvall -- cynical of the intentions of the four men and out to put a halt  to their plan.
The ending is heartwarming and touching. A well done piece  of dramtic work.
Though the series is very dated and special effects are  almost nil, I would say that it still has a place for fans of the SF  genre.
If you enjoy a good science fiction story and have fond memories  of the original Outer Limits, this one is a good start for your collection  - probably the best episode in the series. Go for it.

1202332,4,B00000F5G5,"I remember as a child seeing this particular Outer Limits episode on commercial television. I also remember the feeling of absolute joy at the outcome of the two part episode. This video can still have the same effect  on me some 30 years later, and it is just as I remembered it... an absolute  tear jerker! I highly recommend this video for any and all Outer Limits  fans past, present and future!",952473600,5,399,4.513888888888889
1202333,5,B00000F5G5,"A US Army lieutenant (Steve Inhat) is shot in the head in some unnamed Southeast Asian War, but lives and develops some extraordinary mental abilities.  The CIA (Robert Duval) investigates and discovers that there  are three others, also shot in the head in the same war, who also survive  and begin to display expanded mental capabilities.  The metal used in the  bullets proves to come from a meteor, and is honeycombed to suggest that  something was present that leaked out into their brains.  The leader  develops the ability to manipulate the stock market and provides money for  the others, although they have never met.  One of the other men becomes a  metallurgist although he's had no formalized training in the field; another  disappears up the Amazon looking for rare plants; the final person becomes  an electronics genius.  When they come together they build a spaceship  capable of reaching another star.  The electronics genius holds the CIA at  bay with a force-field while the leader convinces sick and lame children to  accompany them on their trip.  This is the best of the excellent Outer  Limits stories.  Where the writing on Twilight Zone was usually dark and  somber, in this series and this particular epsiode the outcome is one of  hope for the future.",942192000,12,1278,4.9245283018867925

7906748,5,B00000F5G5,"Somehow, I lost my copy of this when I moved recently, and I was concerned that it would no longer be available.  Imagine my surprise and joy to find that brand-new copies are still available--even if they are in VHS format!

This episode is the only 2-parted story from the original Outer Limits series and is, in my view, the best one.  The story involves four ex-soldiers and a group of physically-challenged children--""a few odd pieces"" as the narrator calls them.  The men have been tasked by an extraterrestrial force to create a spaceship with which to transport them and the children to another planet in order to perpetuate the species.  Although the extraterrestrial is never seen, it manifests itself in the men's brains by increasing their natural talents to extraordinary levels and stopping anyone from interfering with ""the project"" as it's called.  Each man struggles with his particular task, but finally comes to terms with it.  A government agent played by Robert Duvall tries to stop the project until he is told about the mission. Eventually, he accepts (if somewhat reluctantly) the group's fate and, as the screen shows the spaceship making its way to the planet, the narrator concludes that those who had been a few odd pieces now fit smoothly ""into the jigsaw of creation.""",1399507200,,1298,4.926605504587156

I thought Demon with a Glass Heand was good but this is even better. I don't understand why we never see anything on tv  like this anymore. Writing has surely fell off. All I can say is, there's a danger in judging people until you know all of the facts. I would have helped him every step of the way and then some. I wish all children with special disabilities could have a place to go where they'll be kings and  rulers of their very own planet.

7906753,5,B00000F5G5,"The most groundbreaking episode of a groundbreaking series The Inheritors is a treatment of multiple fascinating subjects. They vary from the question of what is human to what a sufficiently advanced technology could accomplish, were they to set their minds to it. More importantly, it looks at their possible ethics and how that might impact on how that civilization does things.
Admittedly, the method by which the four protagonists are gathered up and advanced is rather unlikely, but once you get past that its a really interesting story with few holes in either its storytelling or science. Indeed, despite having been written for TV in 1964 the physics still holds good - remarkably so in that current thinking suggests that everything shown is possible.
Well worth the investment.",1072483200,,787,5.15625
7906754,5,B00000F5G5,"How often the ""awe and mystery"" of the outer limits was overstated!

""What is intent""?  ""Can unilateral action ever be ethical?""  This may be the only episode of TOL that ever made me cry...",1023148800,,425,4.613333333333333

7906756,5,B00000F5G5,"Arguably OL's best single story.
Four soldiers from Vietnam suffer what should be mortal head wounds in the same theater of war, recover with astronomical I.Q.'s and curious new interests, and have something no human being can have:  a second brain wave pattern.  More interesting still, all four soldiers' second brain wave pattern is identical.  The soldiers disappear, manage to meet each other through no mechanism our suspicious government can fathom, and act in concert toward the aim of building an interstellar spacecraft  -  and their leader is collecting a number of crippled children for a one-way trip to...somewhere.
This is a truly brilliant episode, the only one in the second season where producer Ben Brady's prosaic police procedural formula actually worked to excellent effect.  Robert Duvall is the senior agent investigating the case, who alternately comes off as monomaniacal or correct in his diagnosis of the situation as a bit of extraterrestrial invasion and kidnapping.  The four infected soldiers are wonderful, Steve Ihnat as the leader striking exactly the right note as a gentle and righteous man, yet one compelled against his will to perform acts even he isn't sure the outcome of.  And the kids are adorable (keep your eyes peeled for the young Morgan Brittany), making the potential menace of the situation all the more palpable.
The only problem with this story is its sometimes artificially inflated melodrama.  This is more than counteracted, however, by the intelligent and sensitive script, the mature performances of the entire cast, and an incredibly satisfying and emotionally moving finale.
Unquestionably one of OL's superior episodes, not to be missed.",1017446400,,1698,5.3059701492537314
