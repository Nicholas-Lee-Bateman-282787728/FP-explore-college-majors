1819298,1,B00007L4MD,This movie is terrible.  You can barely hear what they are saying and it will bore the hell out of you.  Turned off before end.,1100995200,4,127,4.04
1819299,4,B00007L4MD,"Not a great film - good ideas, but it should either have either been expanded or stripped down to a BBC TV play.  Joss Ackland and Ronny Cox both give the expected quality performances as the misguided scientist and the terminal cancer patient who is given ecstasy (with a small e) as the way out of personality problems. But the reason you'll buy this DVD is the young Christopher Walken.  ... Combine this performance with that in the Anderson Tapes and it is easy to see why he could have been up for Han Solo or the lead in Love Story. Charisma, intelligence, phwoaar and acting ability.  He makes it all look so easy.........",1062892800,14,630,4.508771929824562

1819379,3,B00007L4MD,"I give The Mind Snatcher three stars. I feel it probably should be two because it is not a very good view and has a poor plot. The problem is the film has Christopher Walken in it and some good dialogue here and there, so I can't bring myself to downrate it.",1444262400,,258,3.980769230769231
1819380,5,B00007L4MD,"I've read some comments saying that this film was anticlimactic, but there's a good reason for that. There have been many movies made for the sole purpose of warning humanity of the dangers mankind faces, and this is one of them. Walking is adorable in this, as always.",1442620800,,269,4.625
1819381,3,B00007L4MD,for those who love christopher walken  this is of his first  movies for him it just shows what a great actor he is the movie is bad  but he is great in it,1421452800,,154,3.606060606060606
1819382,2,B00007L4MD,A young Ronnie Cox and Christopher Walken in a slow film with no joy at the so called climax. I would not recommend this film to anyone.,1419984000,,136,4.074074074074074

1819385,3,B00007L4MD,nice to see a Very young Christopher Walken & we could see his major star potential but the movie was lame.,1415404800,,107,4.142857142857143

1819388,4,B00007L4MD,"This is a take on the Manchurian Candidate, with added technology.  It's a bit dated, made in the 70s, but still effective.  Christopher Walken handles the lead very well, as usual.",1407456000,3,181,4.806451612903226
1819389,4,B00007L4MD,"This movie is not quite Clockwork Orange but does suggest a crude form of mind control or conditioning of people too willing accept subjugation. I always think filmmakers are telling us a story about something in subtext. This is a slow movie. It uses Vietnam, corruption of U.S. gov't, and military to inform us that this may affect us all. It's worth watching esp. if you are good at reading between the lines.  IMO: Why were Vietnam and soldiers used? Nam was an excuse for many hidden agendas not spoken of in Univ Text books including the extermination of a generation of men from the poor and working class in America. It hints to the use of Nazi Scientists brought to the U.S. to continue unethical medical experimentation for purpose of social engineering and culling of populations. It doesn't suggest this blatantly, but Nam certainly didn't end communism, improve the U.S.economy, or protect the U.S. from Tyrannical regimes. What Nam did do was ruin a whole generation of future heads of households, introduce drugs to soldiers in unprecedented quantities in U.S. military history, while introducing these same drugs into the communities that these PTSD Vets would be returning to.  So by the time they got home it was nearly ensured that these men would not be able to function as fathers, husbands, or leaders within their struggling communities.",1407369600,5,1360,4.9605263157894735
1819390,1,B00007L4MD,I like Christopher Walken as an actor.  This was one of his earlier movies.  Definately a difference skill wise from then until now.  It was pretty cool to see him as a young guy.,1398124800,,179,4.205882352941177
1819391,5,B00007L4MD,Great flick. Good monologues if you are looking for some for a class or for an audition. Very usable and probably never heard of. If you want to see Walken do a low budget Clockwork Orange routine and knock it out of the park then look no further!,1389052800,,247,4.166666666666667
1819392,1,B00007L4MD,I just started watching it and just turned it off.  It was not my kind of movie so I stopped watching.,1388966400,,102,3.857142857142857
1819393,5,B00007L4MD,"The movie itself is fine.  A young Christopher Walken makes this worth seeing.  It's like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" on a smaller scale.",1379548800,2,143,4.68
1819394,3,B00007L4MD,I like movies that are very suspenseful.  This one didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.  Okay for an old movie.,1368144000,,113,3.869565217391304
1819395,5,B00007L4MD,"My Sis wanted this DVD. She got it and was very happy.  Since she is happy about it, so am I.",1272153600,,93,3.4285714285714284
1819396,4,B00007L4MD,"Mind Snatchers is a decent movie.
This will be completely spoiler free.

Basically, Walken plays a really mean and angry person who is taken to a hospital for others with mental issues. He's diagnosed with some sort of condition unto which he is so aggressive. But, given he's such an angry man, he begins to prod into the hospital's background. He makes certain alliances, certain people help him, they even compromise with him, but his tenacious demeanor gets him deeper into our plot.

Overall, there's some good suspense and nail biting moments when you're holding back from screaming 'COME ON, CHRIS!' but mind you this is an old film. If you can't look past the mediocre cinematography, sound feedback and a bit of cheesy supporting acting- don't watch. But, if your view is open to such, enjoy the film.",1269302400,14,810,4.820143884892087
1819397,3,B00007L4MD,"My interest in this movie stems from my fascination w/ mind control, government conspiracy, and mad science / experiments gone wrong. Though all of these elements are present, THE MIND SNATCHERS is just too long and slow. This would have made an excellent 20-30 min. short, or anthology segment. As it is, TMS has a bloated mid-section, sandwiched between a decent beginning and a perfectly downbeat ending. Christopher Walken (THE DEAD ZONE, THE PROPHECY) plays the violent, angry Reese w/ his typical ease and un-forced oddness. Ronny Cox (DELIVERANCE, THE BEAST WITHIN, ROBOCOP) is also good as Reese's unhinged, hillbilly roommate. Shaved down, this could have been a classic...",1264118400,5,682,5.26605504587156

7977930,1,B00007L4MD,Just not my cup of tea.  The prev posts are more interesting than the movie.  I fast-forwarded thru the thing.  Very slow moving plot.,1477785600,,134,4.5
7977931,5,B00007L4MD,have to watch it through to the end - all the humdrum beginning is understood and worth the ride...,1469318400,,99,4.2631578947368425
7977932,2,B00007L4MD,This file has terrible technical quality. Don't bother unless you are a Walken fanatic,1465084800,,86,5.214285714285714
