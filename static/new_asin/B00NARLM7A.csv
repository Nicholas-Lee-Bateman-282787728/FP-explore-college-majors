6621399,5,B00NARLM7A,"I could just write a one word review, and that one word would be AWESOME. I love independent cinema. Even bad movies are entertaining, and worth watching as long as the people involved put their heart and soul to it. That being said, this is by no means a bad movie. Sure, it doesn't have the big Hollywood budget, but what is here is very well done. The special effects are excellent, and the acting, while sometimes over the top, fits perfect with the characters and story. Anyone who has seen other Dustin Mills movies should be very familiar with this cast. Hell, Erin R Ryan and Allison Egan could just sit and stare into a camera for an hour, and I would watch it. Two very talented, beautiful and underrated actresses in my opinion. Add in Brandon Salkil and Dave ""Mr Parka"" Parker and you have movie magic.",1423094400,3,814,4.469798657718121

6621401,1,B00NARLM7A,"Wow! I tend to like low budget indie movies, but there is no excuse for the terrible C- acting. The only horror movie I have seen in the last year that was worse than Skinless was the Cohasset Snuff film and that movie could have been redeemed by a different lead actor. Even the sound editing in Skinless is atrocious. Just listen for when anyone screams.",1421280000,3,356,4.409090909090909
6621402,1,B00NARLM7A,"I'm the opposing voice here. As a lover of horror and gore, I thought I would enjoy this movie. But as soon as it started and the 'actors' opened their mouths, I was like ""Oh no...""

Bad acting, bad atmosphere and stupid as all get out. One of the worst movies I've ever wasted my money on. I took it out of the DVD player, stuck it back in its case and into the trash it went.

I enjoy gore but I don't appreciate complete and utter stupidity.",1421107200,5,444,4.034090909090909
6621403,5,B00NARLM7A,This is probably one of the best films i have seen in awhile. The effects are outstanding and the film is very dark with its story. I love the characters. Dustin mills is a great filmmaker and it's good his films are getting released! Highly recommend,1418169600,5,251,4.478260869565218

8676864,4,B00NARLM7A,"Really great acting for an Indie B movie. Great direction. I enjoyed the movie. If you like B movie slashers, this is good. Erin Ryan's nude scenes are tasteful and she has a great voluptuous figure.",1515715200,,199,4.555555555555555
8676865,4,B00NARLM7A,"If you want to see what $2,000 and some intense imagination can achieve, I would recommend that you purchase this film. Originally shot under the title THE BALLAD OF SKINLESS PETE, director/co-writer/editor/music scorer Dustin Wayde Mills, one of the new wunderkinds of no-budget filmmaking (Whose other films include THE PUPPET MONSTER MASSACRE - 2010; NIGHT OF THE TENTACLES - 2012; ZOMBIE A-HOLE - 2012; EASTER CASKET - 2012; BATH SALT ZOMBIES - 2013; HER NAME WAS TORMENT - 2014; and nearly a dozen more), does a splendid job here, but it wouldn't be nearly as effective if it weren't for the acting talents of Brandon Salkil (who co-wrote the screenplay and is a regular player and screenwriter in Mills' films) and Erin R. Ryan, who are so good, I see nothing but great success in their future. And you would think that with a title like this, the film would be wall-to-wall gore, but while there is plenty to keep gorehounds delighted, deep-down inside this is a parable about how our current healthcare system ignores the dying when there are treatments that can cure them (I, too, was a victim of that very same corkscrew crooked healthcare system, where I learned that the FDA does have a price limit on what it will spend to keep you alive, so it is up to the suffering individual themselves to look for proven treatments outside the United States, even if it means breaking useless laws. A human life should have no price but, until we get the FDA and the government to understand that dying people are willing to try anything to stay alive, that is just what people like myself will do. And I am still here because of it. I may have gone broke doing it, but a person can always make more money. They can't make another life.). The film opens with Dr. Alice Cross (Ryan) strapped to a gurney, pleading for Pete (Salkil) to get some help, but Pete (who we do not see in this sequence) tells Alice, ""That person...that organism...no longer exists.""
The film then moves a couple of months earlier, where a totally nude Pete and his also totally nude ""girlfriend"" Olivia (Allison Fitzgerald) have just finished making love (we see a nasty open sore on the backside of Pete's left shoulder) and Olivia has to leave for her college finals, as soon as she finds her panties (Pete thinks that sex is just sex and doesn't mean it has to be a commitment). While Olivia is walking out of the house, she meets Pete's partner in medical research, Alice, who gives Olivia the cold shoulder, because there is some chemistry (pardon the pun) between Pete and herself that goes back to when they were in medical school together, but neither one of them ever acted on it. When Olivia goes downstairs to the lab, Pete still has no pants or underwear on, so she tells him to get dressed so she doesn't have to stare at his junk (While there is full frontal nudity by both women, we only get to see the naked posterior of Pete. I am not gay, but I think that films should start showing men's junk for the women and gay men, because full-frontal nude women have been on film in a whole lot of low-budget genre films throughout the years and I can count the times I have seen man's junk in these kind of films on one hand).
It seems that Pete has genetically invented a way to cure melanoma and all other kinds of cancer and it is called a ""phasia worm"", a genetically-altered new life form that eats cancer cells until there are no more left in the human body and then dissolves and is released through the sweat glands. So far, Pete has only been able to use the worm on human corpses, but the worm has a side effect: It also eats the human skin. Pete and Alice do an autopsy on the only phasia worm left and synthesize the chemical the worm secretes, so all they have to do is inject live animals with the new serum to see the results. Bad news comes when their chief financial contributor, Neil (Dave Parker), refuses to fund them anymore until they come up with results. Until then, his wallet is closed (and, yes, he's a prick). Rather than wait 20 years for the FDA to approve the serum after many clinical trials (and I firmly believe that the FDA would never approve such drugs because their pockets are full of healthcare and big pharm company's money). Pete decides to use the serum on himself, since that large open sore on the back of his shoulder is melanoma and, eventually, he will die from it. He shows Alice the huge sore and what he is about to do, but she says if he uses the serum on himself, she will never come back (which will hurt Pete more than he knows because Alice is the only real friend he has had for most of his life). But a dying man has to do what he has to do and, when Alice leaves for the night, he injects himself with the serum and, the next morning, the huge sore on his shoulder has disappeared. Pete thinks he has finally created a cure for cancer. But like all good intentions, it comes with a price, and Pete is about to experience the mother of all problems.
At first, everything is peaches and cream for Pete, but his major stumbling block is that he can't tell Alice what he has done. Then the situation begins to get very serious, as he wakes up one morning with his shirt bloody where the sore originally was. He takes off his shirt to discover that it is now triple the size it was before and it is spreading. It seems the serum is eating his skin like the worm did on the human corpses in his trials. Two weeks pass and Pete has not answered any of the phone calls or texts Alice has sent him, so she and Neil enter his house and go down stairs to the lab. They find blood everywhere and Pete has covered himself head-to-toe in medical scrubs, wearing what looks like a rubber mask with a surgical mask and sunglasses. While Alice is checking out another part of the lab, Pete takes off his mask and excretes some kind of liquid right into Neil's face, making his skin dissolve. He also pulls off Neil's right hand (the skin stretches like cheese on a pizza) and, for good measure, removes Neil's lower jaw with his bare hands. Pete goes to eat the jawbone, but Alice sees it all and tries to escape the house.
Pete captures her, knocks her out and when she wakes up, she discovers she is locked in the attic with no way to escape, while Pete wraps Neil's body in plastic and puts it in another room. Pete then enters the attic, hands Alice some toiletries and tells her the whole sordid story of what happened in the past two weeks (via flashback). Pete takes cold showers and baths as his skin dissolves to counteract the itching it causes and he surgically removed his own face with a scalpel before it is eaten away (that mask he wears is not rubber at all, but Pete's actual face removed from his head!). He had also called Olivia over and invited her to work with him over the Summer, but it was only a ruse. When she arrived, he told Olivia to strip (""Let me see your skin. Come closer, let me touch you!"") and he sprayed her with his secretion over her whole body, making all the skin on her body dissolve, Pete eating her flesh to survive (the serum has also given him an extremely long, thin tongue, almost like a tentacle [a running theme in a lot of Mills' films]). He wrapped Olivia's body in plastic and puts it in the same room where he would eventually put Neil.
Alice is repulsed by the whole story, as Pete asserts his love for her and says he has loved her since college, but he didn't want to put their friendship in jeopardy. Alice says that she always loved him, but only as a friend and she never had romantic feelings for him, so Pete leaves the attic. Alice is forced to pee and poop in a bucket (The last time I pooped in a bucket was over 30 years ago when me and a friend were driving in the middle of nowhere and I suddenly got a case of explosive diarrhea [damn you scrapple!] and pooping in a bucket is not as easy as it looks.). Alice finds an old photograph of her and Pete in college, but more importantly, she find her small canister of pepper spray hidden in her backpack which Pete missed. Pete allows her to come downstairs after a couple of days to use the shower and shes hides the small canister of pepper spray in her vagina by cutting the strings on her tampons and using toothpaste as glue (when toothpaste dries, it does have the elements of glue) to attach them to the canister for easy removal (She is resourceful, I'll give her that.). Pete gives her an ugly black dress and makes her put it on in front of him (it looks like an ugly bridesmaid's dress). Pete is obviously as mad as a hatter by now, as he tells Alice the entire human race should be exactly like him. It seems that the jawless Neil is not quite dead yet, as he rises from the plastic and brandishes a gun he had on his body. Peter catches him just in time and beats him to death by pummeling his head into a bloody pulp and then he exposes himself to Alice for the first time (It's a really decent makeup job). Alice pulls her pepper spray from her hoo-ha and uses it on Pete's face. His already skinless face become gooier, as his long tongue wraps around a fleeing Alice's ankle and pulls her towards him. He ties Alice to a chair and duct tapes her mouth, as she watches Pete pull off a piece of Neil's flesh and eat it off a plate like a normal person would eat dinner. Pete pulls the duct tape off of Alice's mouth and once again tells Alice that he loves her, but when he hears Alice say, ""Just because I was being nice to you (in college) doesn't mean I was obligated to f**k you!"", he goes bonkers and squirts the pepper spray into Alice's eyes. Alice wakes up wrapped in plastic in that special room that Pete reserves for his victims, but she is really unable to see because of the pepper spray. She is attacked by the monster dog Pete experimented on (who he calls ""Itchy""). The dogs goes to grab her with its own long tongue, but Alice rips it from its mouth and crushes Itchy's head with a crowbar. Alice tries to escape the house with very blurry vision, but Pete is waiting for her at the top of the stairs. We are now at the point where the film began: Alice nude and strapped to a gurney, while Pete is about to do something awful to her. Since he lost his manly parts to his disease, he plans on impregnating her by sticking his long tongue into her girly parts. As his tongue gets closer and closer to its destination, Pete finally gets a conscience and rips his tongue out of his mouth, releasing Alice before he dies. Alice cradles him before she shoots him in the head with Neil's gun. Alice sits next to Pete's dead body crying her eyes out and the film ends, proving that even monsters can redeem themselves because there still is some semblance of humanity hiding in their bodies.
For a film only costing two grand, Dustin Mills gets a lot of nasty gore, a literate screenplay and, especially, believable acting from both Brandon Salkil and Erin R. Ryan. He does this by keeping the cast down to four people and filming everything on two sets. It's like a filmed play, but with full-frontal nudity and bloody effects. Mills is a prolific director and I haven't seen anything else he has done, but I will be purchasing a few of his films to see if they keep the same standards as this one. Clocking in at a small 80 minutes, the film doesn't overstay its welcome and it looks decent for a filmed-on-digital-tape film. These DTV/SOV films have improved a lot since the late-80's & 90's, so I plan on watching a few more to see if my mind has changed about them. I seriously doubt they have acting as good as is in this film, though. Recommended for people who don't mind horror films with small casts and and underlining parable on what people must do to stay alive when the government fails them. An MVD Visual DVD Release.

8676866,2,B00NARLM7A,"I liked the idea behind the movie and realize that there was a very limited budget. I think they did what they could with what they had. I give the special effects credit, especially since they used real fx + not computers. I definitely don't think this movie was worth the price though. I would like to see this movie remade someday.",1444348800,,334,4.403225806451613

8676872,4,B00NARLM7A,"I've heard about this film and looked up on it and thought I'd buy it. It wasn't a bad film at all. It's up there as one of the goriest/graphic and disturbing films I've seen. The acting was mediocre but in all this film was pretty good. The gore was top notch for a low budget film and the plot was pretty damn well done. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this film, it's totally worth it. I just wish it was a bit longer. Definitely not for people that can't stomach realistic non CGI blood and gore. 6/10",1427760000,,511,4.019607843137255
