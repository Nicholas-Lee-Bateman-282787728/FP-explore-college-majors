2827889,2,B000PSISNS,"The quality of the recording is very poor, and the pace of the exercises themselves is too slow.  I am  disappointed with this purchase.",1344211200,,136,4.625
2827890,2,B000PSISNS,"I feel compelled to write this so that maybe the author will redo this DVD and improve it. The material is excellent and the author, Sherri Betz P.T. is certainly knowledgeable, but the DVD, as a tool for exercise, has many problems. First, it's way too long. I've had it for months and it's almost impossible to make it all the way through. Because all the levels are done in SEQUENCE, you have to keep fast forwarding and rewinding to get to the parts you can do. Why not have two people demonstrating the same exercise at the same time with one showing the beginner and one the advanced version? That alone would probably cut the time in half. Second, there's no index or scene selection, so you can't find sections easily. Third, the commentary is interspersed throughout, further dragging things out. I also bought the Osteoporosis Exercise Book, which seemed to be advertised as a companion to the DVD. I hoped I could use this to speed things up. But it doesn't go along with the DVD at all and has completely different material. The amount of exercise I actually do off this DVD would probably take only 20 minutes, but with all the fast forwarding and rewinding it truly takes hours. It's grueling to get what you need out of this tape. Could be vastly improved.",1343606400,24,1271,4.578947368421052
2827891,5,B000PSISNS,"Compared to sitting on my mat watching a glorious hunk rush through yoga poses to the sights and sounds of ocean waves on an Hawaiian beach, Sherri Betz may look ""boring."" (review by Rudy) ""Watch"" is the key word - I never moved past Rodney's first few poses.  Then I simply admired Rodney.  I can actually get on a mat and work along with Sherri.  The exercises each begin with an explanation and start very slow and easily and work up to surprisingly strenuous Pilates exercises.  Sheri keeps at a tempo I don't have to race to follow.  Nice and slow and sustained.  I do have poor posture due to mild scoliosis which has led to osteoporosis in my upper spine and osteopenia in my hips. Working along with Sheri has been very helpful to me and my bone density scans and spinal xrays have both shown improvement.",1244678400,48,813,4.45945945945946
2827892,5,B000PSISNS,"This is a very challenging and well-constructed routine.  The woman who does the instruction is clear enough and encouraging.  She says to do the routine at least 4 days a week, and she is right.  I have osteoporosis in my spine and often get a back-ache at the end of the day after taking care of my two-year-old, heavy grandchild. Since doing this DVD faithfully, I have had fewer and fewer problems.  I am much more comfortable and stronger; a lot of the aches and pains have disappeared!!",1215820800,47,492,4.556818181818182
2827893,5,B000PSISNS,"I own this in VHS and am about to purchase it in DVD. It is an excellent program,especially for those with osteoporosis but also for those wanting an introduction to Pilates in a safe, effective regimen. The instruction is excellent - clear, well-paced with precise, easy to understand reminders. I recommend this very highly, both for its Pilates instruction but also for its specific osteoporosis benefit in stretching and strengthening. The instructor does the program and cues it; she is a physical therapist and obviously knows both Pilates and the specific condition of osteoporosis.

In response to the other poster identified as Rudy from Kansas: your comments were absolutely off the mark and inappropriate for this video. I know Pilates well and this program is excellent; I also know the kind of therapy that is appropriate for osteoporosis and again her instruction is excellent. As for your odd criticisms of her clothing in the video, they are very strange comments indeed. She is wearing a modest two-piece outfit of a black leotard or camisole with slim straps and she is wearing what are commonly called ""yoga pants"" with slightly flared lower legs but closely fitted otherwise, with elasticized waist; these are the same kinds of clothing usually seen in either yoga or Pilates classes or videos. Your strange comments about a diaper? Grandma? What in the world are YOU watching??  Not THIS video! I only hope that your ridiculous comments didn't put off anyone who might benefit from this video because it would be a very worthwhile purchase for anyone wanting this kind of regimen.",1211846400,75,1601,5.037735849056604
2827894,1,B000PSISNS,"This was the most boring!
exercise dvd I have ever
seen. I showed it to my
Pilates instructor and she
couldn't even make it through
the first five minutes.  The
outfit was hideous, like
someone wearing a diaper, and
it was extremely slow paced.
Probably good for my great-
grandma!",1195257600,3,281,4.62
8193082,5,B000PSISNS,Purchased for a friend - she is very pleased with the exercises and how well they are described.,1519862400,,96,4.388888888888889
8193083,5,B000PSISNS,Clear easy to follow.,1461801600,,21,4.5
8193084,5,B000PSISNS,"Some reviews indicate the voice on this DVD is monotonous, but that didn't matter to me.  The exercises very easy to follow and I felt much stronger and relaxed after using the DVD.  Great DVD for all women, even those who don't have osteoporosis.",1426032000,,247,4.590909090909091
8193085,3,B000PSISNS,"There are some good things on it, however, the video quality isn't very good. I am watching it on my TV with my DVD player. Other videos look fine, but this one is grainy and there are some jerky movements.",1408406400,,206,4.175
8193086,5,B000PSISNS,"Have practiced pilates for many years and consider my self to be on an above average/advance level. Recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. This DVD has helped me learn appropriate modifications to use. I especially like  the pelvic movements that targets the lower back and abs. Gave me a new awareness/control I was lacking even after many years of practice. Great cues and a variety for different levels.
I disagree with some reviewers that complained about the length of this program. Yes, it's long, but you get more bang for your buck. It's organized in chapters, so it's easy to review the program and adjust it to your needs and level. Use the fast forward/rewind button. I have an extensive collection of pilates DVDs and do this for all my workout sessions. No one program can meet everyone needs. I appreciate the extensive amount of material that is offered.
I do agree with the complaints regarding the filming from a single angle.",1403740800,2,942,4.8875
8193087,2,B000PSISNS,"With osteoporosis one is to omit flexion.
This DVD does not respect that fact;
Though Sherri R. Betz was highly recommended
I do not endorse this DVD.",1383350400,3,150,4.592592592592593
8193088,4,B000PSISNS,This is a good exercise tape. The modifications for people with osteoporosis are very helpful. I have been using this tape 3 times per week and I feel the difference in my flexibility already. I am also taking a class in Pilates and showed the tape to my instructor. she also gave this tape a thumbs up.,1378339200,3,303,4.333333333333333
8193089,5,B000PSISNS,"This is an outstanding exercise DVD.  No nonsense, difficult, but I felt like after 3-4 weeks, I could do all the exercises.  Sheri Betz is a phenomenal teacher.  She taught me be precise, never sloppy with this program.  Very inspiring.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone of any age.
PS I have Osteoporosis",1366761600,4,310,4.666666666666667
8193090,5,B000PSISNS,"Many DVDs are designed to PREVENT osteoporosis, but this one is designed for those (like me) who HAVE osteoporosis. The exercises are led by a physical therapist who describes all the movements in detail, and suggests alternate movements for those with other physical limitations.  None of the movements proved too challenging, and I am convinced they will help to build greater flexibility and prevent bone fractures.  I highly recommend it!",1364688000,2,442,5.3
8193091,3,B000PSISNS,"I found the instructor's voice to be comforting and pleasant, her clothing and demeanor reasonably modest, and the exercises featured here were good.  However, the quality of the video was sorely lacking.  The entire video was shot from a single viewpoint, and often did not show enough ""spot detail"" so some of the exercises in terms of positioning or detail in movement were unclear.  We needed zoom shots, plus a roving camera that would have shown the exercises from various angles to ensure proper positioning.  The pace is very slow, but that's okay.  The worst part of it for me personally is that I could not even dream of doing so many of the exercises here, so it was very disheartening and left me feeling extremely discouraged and sort of hopeless : (

I think the best ""intro to pilates"" dvd out there is ""Pilates Workout for Dummies"" by Michelle Dozois.  I wish Sherri Betz could have modeled these exercises for osteoporosis on Michelle Dozois' video style, it would have been much more enjoyable and understandable in terms of technique.  I also wish she could have presented a few exercises using free weights, which can also help combat osteoporosis.",1348444800,11,1168,4.834170854271357
