It had me enthusing and raving and shouting Bravo.

I loved the music, starting with the beat, a fast-paced energetic folk-dance beat that NEVER STOPPED!  It made me feel as exhiliarated as if i'd been doing energetic folk-dance stomping  WITHOUT STOPPING the whole time.  It made me feel the happiness and energy of REAL PHYSICAL DANCING.  You know how if you are doing a vigorous fast Polish folk-dance, twirling, swirling, stomping, weaving, by the end you are exhausted and laughing--- that's what i felt like from sitting on a couch!!

I loved the modern//folk blend of music, like Stravinsky plus Kletschmer band, i loved the tonality of ( the shtetl? or whatever).

I loved the energy of the performers--- is this what Yiddish theatre was like once?  Or is it modern--- they are dancing like this, in principle,  at the Paris national ballet now, non-stop motions.  These Czech were better though, they NEVER STOPPED doing their energy-interpretations of ordinary movements, making everything into energy--- tumblings, turnings, like a hyperactive kid, except everyone became hyperactive!

I was thrilled!  Something really NEW & DIFFERENT; or just my introduction to old Eastern Europe? I loved the music.  One of my top favorites (having seen it only once).",1283990400,3,1292,5.213592233009709
8338038,4,B001RIGCEW,"From the title we Americans expect Goldilocks and the Three Bears, but this fairy tale in dance from Prague is another tale altogether. In this version, a young cook disobeys his evil king by eating a dish that enables him to talk to animals. When the king gobbles down the dish he knows that the cook has betrayed him and, as a punishment, sets for him three tasks. Accompanied by his faithful dog, the young cook sets out on the tasks. He is aided by animals (mostly insects and fish) that he saves from various dangers. One the of last tasks is to bring back two waters--one of which causes death and another which brings life. Their powers are revealed when the dog is killed trying to save an insect from a spider and is killed. The young cook kills the spider with the deadly water and restores his faithful companion with the other. Finding Goldilocks, the bride he has been seeking for the king, he falls in love with her and she with him. The angry king orders the young cook's death, but the insect that was saved tells Goldilocks how to bring him back to life. Seeing this, the king decides to partake of the magic water, but swallows the wrong one and dies. The ballet ends with great rejoicing.

The music is played by a small orchestra and is reminiscent of Stravinsky's L'Histoire du Soldat (but not nearly as good). The choreography is quite simple, but clever and easily performed by the young cast. It reminded me of performances by the Northern Ballet Theatre. The young cook is very personable, the dog is cute, Goldilocks beautiful, and the entire production is charming. Children (and those of us who are still children at heart) will enjoy it.",1274486400,2,1666,4.5719063545150505
