3924844,5,B002GJX0QO,"I have watched this video many times and found it to inspire and clarify how to approach journaling. Gay and Christina walk the viewer through all the basic steps for starting a journal, sharing their insights, coaching, and humor. An excellent production, Jerome Domurat's editing style is fluid and straighforward. This is an excellent DVD for anyone, adults, children, teenagers, and could help teachers in the classroom.",1266537600,4,424,5.343283582089552
3924845,5,B002GJX0QO,"If you love ""step-by-step"" instruction and are a ""visual learner"" AND love getting to ""meet"" the artists, this is a great video.  When I viewed it, I was a beginner artist, and I watched it along with my friend, an accomplished oil and acrylic artist.  We used the video to do a ""paint-along"" together, which was alot of fun and the perfect introduction to art journaling and watercolor.  This is a wonderful video for a watercolor painting group or journaling group to do together as a paint-along.  After watching the video, I took the class from Gay and Christina, and have been carrying my watercolor journal with me on day-trips and vacations ever since, and am now on my third journal book.  On this DVD, Gay and Christina make journaling FUN and accessible and they are so encouraging with their own stories.  This video contains pages from their own journals, which are very inspiring. Also, if you have any qualms about freestyle sketching, this video will encourage you.",1251763200,10,980,4.803571428571429
3924846,5,B002GJX0QO,"I came upon this excellent DVD two years ago and have watched it several times since then. I was already a fan of keeping a watercolor journal. This DVD had so many wonderful and simple ideas for getting your day down on a page. I really liked the way Gay and Christina divided up the sessions in an easy progression. I teach groups of beginning or intermediate watercolor journal keepers and I have found their way of instruction to be very helpful. They are encouraging and allow a novice to feel comfortable even if they have never drawn or painted a single thing in their lives. The DVD is jam packed with information and encouragement.

3924847,5,B002GJX0QO,"Some time ago I found this DVD, and I have not stopped journaling since!! I Even started my own Blog!  The talent and understanding of illustrated journaling is lovingly and clearly presented and inspiration ensues! I only wish this DVD was available 30 years ago - I could have chronicled so much of my children's childhood and my travels and everyday adventures.  I highly recommend this DVD. Everyone can start a watercolor journal and the Joys are Endless!",1251763200,5,460,4.884615384615385
3924848,5,B002GJX0QO,"I purchased this video a couple of years ago and have watched it several times and even had groups of friends to watch it with me.  It's a wonderful video to introduce one to watercolor journaling.  It takes away the fear of the page. My favorite ""line"" in the whole video is ""our goal is imperfection""!!!  How freeing that statement is!  I highly recommend this to anyone considering watercolor journaling.  Gay and Christina shoe how easy it really is in plain, simple terms.",1251763200,4,477,4.698795180722891
3924849,5,B002GJX0QO,"I've enjoyed the glorious journal pages of Gay and Christina and their students for years, so I was delighted to find this video.  In separate chapters, it explains the techniques that they teach their beginning and advanced students.  There's plenty of inspiration here, and no intimidation.  These instructors are used to teaching the very new student, but their own work is so gorgeous it will inspire you if you have been keeping a sketchbook journal for years.",1251763200,3,465,5.012987012987013
3924850,5,B002GJX0QO,"As a retired art teacher, I found Beginning Watercolor Journaling to be informative for the experienced artist as well as the novice.
It is easy to check out selected sections.
The DVD can stand alone for it's aesthetic quality and viewed many times.

8369795,3,B002GJX0QO,"I'm a homeschooler, and I wanted to do nature journaling with my kids. This video was recommended on a homeschool blog that I follow, and I thought that since it was geared specifically for nature journaling and not just watercoloring in general, that it would best fit our needs.  And it is okay.  But not great.

Other reviewers have complained that the women are too chatty.  I don't have a problem with that, but I do dislike how they seemed not to have a plan as they start some of the segments.  They say things like, ""Well, should we do it this way?"" or ""Should we do it like that?""  If I pay for an instructional video, then I would prefer that the teachers put thought into what they are teaching ahead of time.  Maybe they were trying to demonstrate the thought process they go through as they start a journal page.  Maybe that I means what I really wanted was a straight-up watercoloring instructional video.  If I had it to do again, that's what I would buy instead.

I've recently been reading the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laws-Guide-to-Nature-Drawing-and-Journaling/dp/1597143154/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laws Guide to Nature Drawing and Journaling</a>, which I LOVE, but trying to communicate all the many, many lessons in that book to antsy children was overwhelming.  This video conflicts with some of the important lessons in the Law's Guide, such as what the three primary colors actually are and how to mix them.  In the end, I picked several of the step-by-step lessons in the Law's Guide which were about birds, and I had my kids work through those.",1500768000,2,1623,5.06015037593985
8369796,5,B002GJX0QO,"This is an inspirational DVD - gave me the impetus to begin art journaling and a desire to learn more about watercolor...subsequent online classes have helped, and also make me realize what a good background this provided.",1420761600,,222,5.027027027027027
8369797,1,B002GJX0QO,"What do you get when you stick a video camera in front of a couple of clueless airheads who call themselves ""artists""...and then have the audacity to charge nearly $30 for 90 minutes of banal babbling, and dabbing a couple of watercolors on paper. For those who are considering spending their money on this waste of time, there are many, many better videos online that are free. The reviewers who gave this turkey high ratings must have been looking at a different DVD.",1403740800,2,469,4.662650602409639
8369798,3,B002GJX0QO,It was ok but I was hoping for a little more.  I pretty much knew everything they showed and was hoping for some new ideas.,1403049600,,123,3.92
8369799,5,B002GJX0QO,Great cd!! exactly what I expected....a great demo of art journaling and sketching. A little pricy though but Im from canada,1399939200,,124,4.9523809523809526
8369800,3,B002GJX0QO,I enjoyed the presentation and basic drawing. I would have liked to see more of each artists personal entries and writing as well as paintings and other daily ideas.,1397692800,,165,4.724137931034483
8369801,5,B002GJX0QO,"I am so glad I purchased this DVD.  The two ladies are fun to watch and listen to, and best of all, they do wonderful demonstrations of watercolor painting.  It is a valuable resource for a beginning painter like me.  After only watching a few minutes, I was able to do a watercolor wash:  one of those things that sounds simple, but reading ""how to do it"" never quite made it clear.  Well worth it!",1370390400,,399,4.266666666666667
8369802,1,B002GJX0QO,"I Teach watercolor to both adults and children and this dvd was booed by the audience. Stuffed bunnies really.  While some of the principles were useful the overly tender and non challenging approach left both the children and adults frustrated. to quote the person who picked the tape the pictures on the box were really great and then it was just two ladies laughing and talking and drawing bunnies.
Maybe this plays well in California but the intelligence and drive of a New Yorker is frustrated.
A more honest set of pictures that lets the teacher and the students know that it is about basic principles and not about the lovely pictures on the cover would be ....well honest for one and would let the audience see just what the subject would be....Even the little girls were bored with the bunny bit and as for the adults..Unless there home ridden and very limited they just looked at me like I was nuts. At the home they just said know they wanted to paint some landscapes.

I can't understand all the rave reviews...friends maybe?
First lesson of teaching is: 'never play down to your students!!!!!!!!!!'",1347580800,9,1111,4.721649484536083
8369803,5,B002GJX0QO,"I really enjoyed this video. Unlike a book, you get to see both of them doing the techniques and it makes a big difference. Way better than a book. It's like taking an in-person class with them, and I think it is well worth the price. I can see this material covering at least 3 in-person classes when you practice what they are showing you. The best part is how accessible they make the techniques. It really is something anyone can do. I was impressed by how quickly you can sketch using the techniques shown of blind contour and sighting. Even though I previously learned those in ""Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain"", this dvd encourages you to go faster, let go of perfection and have fun with it. I've already started my journal and look forward to watercolor journaling enhancing my travels, helping me to slow down and really experience where I am.",1347321600,4,860,4.519230769230769
8369804,4,B002GJX0QO,"This DVD is good because it introduce you to watercolors in the most basic form possible. However, it is kind of brief on each subject,still informative,and shows you right away how they journal. Even though I already knew some of the techniques I was able to learn a few things that are useful. What I did not like much was that the artists kept talking between themselves looking at each other most of the time; that kind of made me feel like I was eavesdropping on them. Though the information is valuable, I think that it is overpriced, I was expecting way more from this DVD due to it's length. However, I still recommend it to anyone new to watercolors and/or journalinng; you'll find it very informative and inspirational.",1330300800,10,729,4.658914728682171
