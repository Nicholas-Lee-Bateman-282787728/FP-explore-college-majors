3764648,5,B001QFF620,"Dr. Joel Fuhrman strikes a nerve with his new Osteoporosis Protection for Life DVD.

From the start, Dr. Fuhrman rejects the marketing hype of the drug industry. He makes a persuasive case for nutrition, the correct choice of nutritional supplements, and exercise for prevention of osteoporosis, while arguing that commonly prescribed drugs often fail to achieve the intended benefit and may even achieve the reverse--and with considerable cost and side-effects.

Anyone concerned about future risk for osteoporosis--meaning all women and many men!--should view Dr. Fuhrman's instructive and insightful video. His step-by-step program shows the viewer how to seize control over this ubiquitous condition using tools that are already within arm's reach.

3764652,1,B001QFF620,"Many of the movements included in this program are very dangerous for those who have even ""mild"" osteoporosis.  How negligent not to have made that repeatedly clear throughout the presentation.",1396915200,2,193,5.433333333333334
3764653,5,B001QFF620,"Wish I could have done this a decade ago when I was first diagnosed with osteoporosis. I'm eating the diet and my physicians say they have never seen anyone grow new bone (for a pelvic fracture) as fast as I.  They expected someone to grow as much bone after 3 months, but not 3 weeks.  By the next x-ray, the fractured bone was totally replaced with new bone.

The exercises are important. Unfortunately, I am not strong or limber enough to do them --too many injuries and not enough flexibility because I keep breaking older bones.

I refuse to ingest E-coli created genetically engineered pharmaceuticals, and only eat foods grown by the organic method, which I think is part of the reason the minerals in the soil are getting to my bones faster.

Herbicides made by petrochemical corporations are mineral chelators and bind the minerals to the soil blocking them from getting to the plants and the people or animals who need them to repair and grow.

Eating organic vegan helps me repair and build new bone fast while I work on getting stronger.",1395014400,6,1049,4.673913043478261
3764654,3,B001QFF620,"While I believe this is a good DVD to have for lots of people, I am not able to do all of the exercises on it due to mobility issues.  It isn't very long for the price, but still has some good exercises to follow.",1386115200,2,213,3.7333333333333334
3764655,4,B001QFF620,"The lecture part of the DVD was good, but I don't look at it on a regular basis.  The exercises have been good since I have osteoporosis in the spine.",1379894400,,150,4.0
3764656,5,B001QFF620,"Like all other Dr Fuhrman information and related products, this DVD is fantastic! I highly recommend it to all! Far more athletic than I anticipated, Dr Fuhrman absolutely knows what works and shares same with us. Delighted with my purchase and will share info about it with anyone who will listen!",1377907200,2,299,4.882352941176471

3764666,4,B001QFF620,"the exercises on here are good, but nothing new to what I've seen before.  For anyone who has never exercised before, this will be great.  Easy exercises for the most part.  Since I have seen this DVD I can do the exercises  without it because there are only afew to do and very easy to learn and remember.",1352505600,9,306,4.224137931034483
3764667,5,B001QFF620,"An easy to follow workout confirming my belief that nutrition and muscle strengthening, not medication with questionable side effects, is the best way to combat osteoporosis. The informative bonus booklet details the key factors causing osteoporosis and the best food (fruits and vegetables) for bones. A great bone strengthening regimen.",1344297600,7,338,5.78
3764668,4,B001QFF620,I think the Osteoperosis Protection for Life DVD is an excellent source of information. I was diagnosed with Osteopenia a year ago. This DVD is knowledgeable as to what key exercises to focus on to prevent Osteoperosis. Dr. Fuhrman explains a lot about health and nutrition along with the supplements you should be focusing on. The exercises are easy and he and his team also demonstrate each exercise. I highly recommend this DVD.,1343606400,13,431,4.917808219178082
3764669,4,B001QFF620,"This video pinpoints all of the basic information you need to build bone with targeted exercise rather than lose bone as you age.  The emphasis is on instruction, and each exercise is carefully explained and demonstrated;  the group then does four or five repetitions of each, rather than the full workout. Once you have the moves down, you can stop the DVD and do the recommended number of reps.  The accompanying booklet is full of great information about nutrition and lifestyle choices.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to be proactive about their bone health or is finding out after the fact that she/he is losing bone density and wants to do something about it.  Some of the exercises involve jumping, so probably best to check with your doctor about safety if you have significant osteoporosis already.",1331337600,32,822,4.884892086330935

3764671,5,B001QFF620,"I follow Dr. Fuhrman's Eat to Live eating plan and was anxious to see him in action in this video.  It is easy to follow and shows a number of exercises designed to strengthen the bones, especially important as we age.  The other participants are his office manager and his wife, Mrs. Fuhrman.  It's not a fancy DVD, but it does the trick.  I like it and think it will do as stated- protect you from osteoporosis.  No broken hips for me!",1312416000,29,437,4.280487804878049
3764672,3,B001QFF620,I got it and found out there are numerous exercises that I could not do because of the advance stages of my osteoporosis.  It would be good for people to prevent getting it.,1309219200,21,173,4.242424242424242
3764673,5,B001QFF620,"I was so tired of getting insistance by my doctor that I MUST take Boniva or my bones would break when I got older.  After lots of research about Boniva (and other Osteopenia/Osteoporosis drugs),  I refuse to take them. These drugs only make our bones hard,  they do not strenghten our bones natually (the way nature meant it).  I took the drug (Boniva) 1 year and developed GERD and muscle aches and pains, etc.  I had lots of side effects.  The cure was worse than the so-called ""disease"" (which it really isn't).  Unfortunately a lot of our medical community give us a ""pill"" to try and fix our problem.  10-15 years ago, I wouldn't have even been given any prescription for my bone density score.  Finally, a doctor who supports what I have alwasy thought.  Our body is made to heal itself if only we use the proper diet, exercise and rest to help it heal.  Thank you Doctor for a DVD that I wish all persons would view and use,  who have osteopenia/osteoporosis.  I will be taking this DVD to my OB/GYN to show her when she get ready to do my bone scan again this year.",1297036800,68,1074,4.363636363636363
8335491,1,B001QFF620,"Instructions do not include adaptive exercises for those with knee pain. Most all of the exercises are bending and doing squats which of course strengthen your legs but fall ill to knee pain and joint problems. This is Not a very well designed routine.

8335493,5,B001QFF620,"This video is specific and shows you the proper exercises  to reduce your risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia. It's nice to know the exact exercises to work on. It does not go through the whole work out but he shows you how to do the exercises and then you can do however many reps you want on your own.  You can adapt the exercises to your ability. He also talks about the importance of a weighted vest which is a great idea based on the research I've done about it. I wish I had known about osteoporosis earlier. I am only 50 but I am very small, only 5 feet tall and thin so someone like me is at a higher risk for osteoporosis even though I'm a healthy person.",1490745600,,664,4.1
8335494,4,B001QFF620,"Good exercise routine for strength building, especially in the thighs, back and hips. I bought mine a few years back off his web site. I was so sore after i first tried it, could barely walk for 3 days..lol. I do it twice a week and now notice it's easier. I like it cuz it's a short routine. There are 10 different exercises which is perfect. I've been following Dr Fuhrmans diet recommendations for over 10 years and have seen many health improvements.",1486080000,,454,4.481927710843373

This book would probably be helpful for someone with osteopenia, but I don't recommend it for people with osteoporosis.  Many better options out there.",1424822400,,325,4.785714285714286
