While I really loved this series with all their twists and turns, this season was a downer, especially the whole first episode concerned getting a cursed pair of swimming trunks off the guy. The alternative world episodes just bombed. Not recommended for those that have a warm feeling for the first two seasons.",1469750400,2,380,4.953125

7712046,5,B01DEQ941M,"I've seen the entire series of When They Cry, this OVA is a good one to buy. I don't want to spoil any info of these upcoming OVA, but it will enlighten you with new info, that's all I have to say. I recommend you have to see the first and second season of When They Cry, my answer will explain why I said that before. Other than that please enjoy these series and own them. I know I'm purchasing them all",1459641600,6,405,3.951219512195122
7712047,4,B01DEQ941M,"This collection contains the five 30-minute OVA episodes of Higurashi, taking place somewhere after the events of ""Kai."" Two are extensions of the more comedic events at the beginning of each of Season 1's arcs, and I found the humor to actually be well-played and ironic, focusing on the ridiculousness of some past events and characterizations. The other three are much more keeping in with the spirit of Higurashi, and there are some genuinely chilling scenes that make me lament why this release does not receive more laudatory comments from fans of the series. Some of the emotional moments and situations have a greater sense of gravity than can be found in either Season 1 or Season 2. Now, far be it from me to say these are worth your money, though, as they are expensive (as much as a full anime) for an episodic package. However, I will say that ""Rei"" is definitely worth the time of Higurashi fans, so procure this somewhere, somehow, and permit yourself a peek. Take my word as you see fit.",1459382400,10,1003,4.672316384180791

8755760,5,B01DEQ941M,"One going into these must know two main things.  If your starting here have a buddy with you that has seen all of it so they can translate a lot of back story.  Secondly these are bonus episodes almost like a OVA separate from the main storyline but borrowing a lot from them.

The first episode is just nonsensical fun, next 3 are a what if scenario that really pocks fingers at the second seasons wrapped up nicely ending.  Something i wasn't the biggest fan of, but also understand that it was necessary to have a cohesive experience by episode 50.  But this in many ways comments on a wrapped up ending as it was a possibility and choices were made.  The final episode is hilarious and really plays into it's horror roots without actually diving deep and messing up the whole happy vibe.

I watched these with my roommate last night, she's never seen any of them before and she liked it.  But i did play translator for a lot of the big story points for the middle 3 episodes.",1487808000,,979,4.370165745856354
8755761,4,B01DEQ941M,The story was good enough. But I want Sentai Film Works to improve several points. I 'd like to turn off English Sub. And I want English Dub as well.,1482624000,,149,4.0

8755763,5,B01DEQ941M,"If you are here you probably don't need a review to help make a decision. You know you are buying this one. The first season was English dub second and third are sub. I prefer dub because I don't speak Japanese and I love the voice talent, but this story is so good I'm just glad to have it sub or dub.",1473033600,,302,3.8870967741935485
8755764,4,B01DEQ941M,"While the first season was a mystery-horror-thriller, and the second an exposition and resolution about the first season, this ""season"" (only 5 episodes) comes across as an after-thought, or at least the middle 3 episodes do called the Die Killing arc. The first episode is an overflowing return to silliness bordering on the absurd. If you can get through that one, you are rewarded with a surprisingly deep and thoughtful final arc, Die Killing. These 3 episodes were worth the purchase. I enjoyed them more than the entire 2nd season because it's lays on the ethics and philosophy thick enough to make anyone doubt their choices in life, finishing bittersweet. It's not the best of its kind, but it's really good. The final episode is more like the 1st and returns to silliness, probably trying to leave the audience a bit lighter-hearted after hitting them with the Die Killing arc. For me, the 1st and 5th episodes were fairly forgettable but the Die Killing episodes were amazing. So there's no return to the strangeness that made the 1st season and the franchise itself famous, but it's still worth a watch if you love the characters.",1469750400,2,1141,4.856410256410256
