5775402,5,B00D6I7IYY,"As I write this, the shock of the loss of nineteen firefighters in the major wildfires in Arizona is still an open wound on the hearts of all who consider such men and women doing this as a career as  true heroes. Indeed, my DVD arrived on the day of the memorial service in Arizona for the fallen ""Hotshots"". Forest fires, newly coined as ""Wildfires"" are part of life in the American West. They will always occur, and teams of firefighters will always go into danger to extinguish them to lessen loss of life and property. And unfortunately, from time to time, some of these courageous women and men will lose the fight and their lives.
 The Red Skies of Montanna was produced in 1952 and is the story of the loss of five of six members of a crew of elite  ""smokejumpers"" working on a remote fire in the forests of Montanna, much the same as what has just happened as life imitated art. In this story, however the foreman of the crew is the only survivor, and in investigations that clear him, the seeds of doubt as to his courage are planted in his own mind as well as in the mind of the son of one of the killed crewmen, and the film rides on this terrible  tide of amnesiac doubt, mistrust, and blame. Richard Widmark as the survivor and Jeffery Hunter as the vengeful son shoulder the load. Action is present in a well done plot and Technicolor photography is beautiful, although most intense in fire scenes. And speaking of scenes, the film was mostly shot on location with some real fires filmed and intercut with studio filmed special effects. That's real fire the actors are filmed in, with the only model stuff shown is some false forests going up. No computer effects were even dreamed of then. Hats off to 20th Century Fox on this one. The cast actually went through a substantial bit of U.S. Forest Service basic training and show the smokejumper drills with actors doing a lot of the stuff. Also to be found among the actors are many guys who would later be recognizable faces in movies ant TV of the 50s and 60s- Richard Boone, Richard Crenna( in the equipment line behind "" Pop"" as the doomed men gear up for the drop early in the film), John Fiedler( we know him as the little owl-faced milquetoast actor from the era, but mostly as ""Lawyer Dagget"" from TRUE GRIT),and in the crew cafeteria and later on the fire line at the climax of the movie, look for Charles Bronson.
 The Forest Service also supplied equipment and aircraft for the film. Great shots of the smokejumpers inside and leaving a USFS Ford TriMotor. A movie to watch as well as own. (Boy, it would be a natural to remake and update today.)
 One final note, the story here is fiction, but it is rooted in fact. In 1949, a smokejumper team was lost in fighting a fire in the Mann Gulch tragedy. This story borrows a bit from those events. And still more, in the late  1990s, Sebastian Junger, writer of The Perfect Storm, wrote the book YOUNG MEN AND FIRE, telling the story of yet another such fatal tragedy as well as directing interest towards the Mann Gulch event and this film. One more book- Stan Cohen of Missoula, Montanna, home of the smokejumpers school, wrote a history of SMOKEJUMPING in the 1980s with references to the above movie and events up to that time.",1373500800,18,3253,4.457142857142857
5775403,2,B00D6I7IYY,"This review is about the poor video quality of this film. It looks like an old analog master, probably once ran on television. It is too bad that this studio cannot do a better job on these mod releases.",1372550400,6,203,4.230769230769231
5775404,5,B00D6I7IYY,"The re-emergence of this film is extremely timely, given the tragic deaths of 19 firefighters in Arizona as of July 1, 2013.  The film starkly shows how dangerous these wildfires are. How they put the movie together is a wonder, particularly in an era without computer special effects.  Trees are burning and exploding all over the place.  You learn a great deal about fire-fighting back in the 1950s (Richard Widmark has a walky-talky that looks like a giant handheld robot) and it's in color no less.  The blah actress Constance Smith is given top billing but has little to do but wish her husband (Widmark) well as he goes off to fight another fire.  (She's vacuuming the bedroom when he calls to tell her.)  There's a big misunderstanding by Jeffrey Hunter about Richard Widmark, but it all gets resolved at the end after everyone fights a really big fire.  Richard Boone, who has always seem dour and depressing to me, turns in a really good performance here and is sympathetic to boot.  Oh, by the way Fox Cinema Archive fans -- there's a pet raccoon in this film and I believe it's the same one used in ""Lost in the Wilderness.""  A good full-frame (4:3) print. Another review here is critical of the print, but to this eye it's worn but the color is solid and it's stable.",1372550400,8,1279,4.574561403508772

5775440,4,B00D6I7IYY,Was a good movie about the smokejumper forest firefighters. Had a good story line but wish more time was allowed about the firefighter techniques the smokejumpers use. All in all was a good enjoyable movie and would recommend it to be seen by all.,1435795200,2,247,4.636363636363637

5775444,5,B00D6I7IYY,"I first (and last) saw this movie in the late 1950s when I was a kid and have long been trying to get a copy.  Thanks to Amazon for making it available.

  I remembered it fondly but not terribly well and I'm happy to say that it is still very much worth watching.  It is the story of the folks who fight forest fires.  In the movie, the guys are smoke jumpers, guys who parachute to places where it's hard to get to.

  The movie's story was loosely based on a real incident, the Mann Gulch Fire of August 1949, when a number of smoke jumpers were killed when the fire spread very quickly.

  This is an exciting and dramatic movie, with a lot of action, some beautiful scenery and a narrative at the beginning of the film that talks a little bit about how forest fires might get started (dry lightning, or lightning strikes when no rain follows).  I like those little touches and wish modern movie makers would go back to those just a little bit.

  The cast was made up of actors who were well known at the time and I also like the differences in mood and style of movie-making:  I like modern approaches too, but sometimes it's just a lot of fun to see them made the old fashioned way.

Over all this is a winner.  There have been a number of movies about fire fighting, but all too few on fighting forest fires.",1421712000,,1316,4.21285140562249
5775465,5,B00D6I7IYY,"I saw the movie when it first came out. I was disappointed that they didn't follow the actual fire.
 I was there and fought the Mann Gulch Fire from 6 Aug to 10 Aug. 1949.
 The movie couldn't follow what had actually happen because it was still being investigated.
  I go back to Helena, MT occasionally - 1999 for the  50th Memorial  Anniversary -
  and lately Sept 2014 for the 65th anniversary. Glad that you have the film to remember that Forest fires are not forgiving and we can still praaaaay for those thaaat have perished in  protecting Mother Nature.",1420588800,,560,4.52

5775471,5,B00D6I7IYY,"Dynamite movie.  I saw this as a kid on TV.  Could never find a copy anywhere.  It's based on a real event that occured about when I was born.  Years later I'm working in CT.  A woman I worked with yelled out ""Mann Gultch"" when I mentioned the movie.  Turns out she was from Montana.  Seems that everybody from that part of the woods knows about the incident and the movie.  May I suggest reading ""Young Men and Fire"" by Norman McClean.  It covers the fire, the subsequent loss of life and the inquiry into it.",1403308800,,510,4.229166666666667

5775473,5,B00D6I7IYY,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1952.  It was based on an actual event from 1949 (The Mann Gulch Fire.)  I was 7 at the time, and it must have made a huge impression on me, because I have remembered all these years.  I have despaired because it wasn't available (that I know of) until recently.  I received my copy of the dvd yesterday (5/2014) and I must say I am as impressed now as I was then.  The filming of the fire scenes had to have been intense for all concerned.  I love Richard Widmark.  He always had such a convincing presence, no matter what role he played, and this role calls for bravado, reluctance, and leadership.  To me, he covered these more than adequately.  The entire movie made me cry, cheer and be a bit scared.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this great movie available.  By the way, if you look carefully, you'll catch a quick glimpse of a young Charles Bronson (in an uncredited role) in mess hall scene.  I wasn't sure what I'd seen, but a few minutes later I heard his unmistakable voice.  This movie is also, in my view, a great companion piece to Steven Spielberg's ""Always.""",1400630400,4,1118,4.342995169082125
5775474,5,B00D6I7IYY,I first saw this when I was 6. Liked it then and was really surprised  when I saw that it was finally on DVD. It is still one of my movies till this day,1396915200,,152,3.4705882352941178
5775495,4,B00D6I7IYY,"A 1952 drama about a United States Forest Service smokejumper (Richard Widmark) who works to save his fire fighting crew from a disastrous forest fire and how the son of a smokejumper that was lost reacts to his perceived cowardice. This film is loosely based on a real event, the Mann Gulch Fire of 1949. If you like breathtaking scenery you'll probably find a great interest in this film. The acting is a little over dramatic at times, but nothing anymore unusual for early '50s films. Widmark, as he usually does, effects a strong performance, but at the expense of very slight overacting. Plausible because this film is based on a real event, the story is surrounded most of the time by natural action.  .",1393718400,,709,4.672
5775496,5,B00D6I7IYY,"Since last year when we lost the 19 firefighters..this movie really comes so close to the real thing. No dump blue/green screen..but their right in the middle.

5775499,5,B00D6I7IYY,"I'm a Widmark fan from the days of early TV broadcasting his films on weekend matines.  Smoke Jumpers, (later renamed Red Skies of Montana) protrays the first 'hot shots' in the USFS.  Paratroopers dropped into back country wild fires to hold the lines until Cats could clear roads into the fire zones for full on assaults.  The delight is seeing the country as it was sixty years ago; the cars we drove, the way we dressed and talked, and what we expected of ourselves.  The simple plot of this film unwinds within the war zone of big fires.  It's all he-man and the social mores are so different.  Women stayed home and fretted and men went out to slay the dragons.  Really it's the look back to another time I enjoy the most.  Depiction films, movies based in current affairs, show us close ups and wide angles on our own past.  Our Grandfathers, my Dad, I'm 61, lived these movies.  They take us back.  Richard Widmark had a talent for the troubled, introverted, courageous, everyman.  I'll take him over John Wayne's too big heros anytime.  Roberta in Reno",1386806400,4,1061,4.579787234042553
5775500,5,B00D6I7IYY,"This DVD has great color and comes in a good packaging.  The movie is well known but little seen.  The story is inspired by the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire that claimed the lives of a smokejumper crew and the surviving leader was the subject of an investigation and was cleared of any wrong doing.  This film is a fictional version of that incident with Richard Widmark as the surviving team leader.  Widmark had made a career out of playing aloof hard nosed leaders of elite teams.  This movie comes just one year of him playing the leader of a team of Underwater Demolition Team divers in ""The Frogmen"" and while that movie inspired a generation of watermen to become frogmen and SEALs it is no doubt that this movie played a big part in leading young foresters to become smokejumpers.

The movie shows many of the unique aspects of smokejumping, such as the ford tri-motor aircraft that they jumped from and also special training like the use of loweringlines and the dreaded sit up rack and has some good jump scenes. A few years ago I worked on airfield improvements at the Missoula smokejumper center, where this movie was filmed, and it was interesting to compare it from than and now.

I first became aware of smokejumpers in the 1970's in jr High School when I read the book ""The Smokejumpers"" by Randle Hurst about 1955 fire season.  After 6 years as an army paratrooper I became a park ranger but went to work under the waves as an underwater rescue/swift water rescue specialist.  That was rewarding but when a touring Ford Tri-motor came to my airfield I took a ride and sat by the jump door and dreamed about what could have been.

This is a good movie and a good way to enjoy the outdoors when you are in doors.
