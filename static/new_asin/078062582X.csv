33081,5,078062582X,"This film is quite interesting, and actually not as bad as many people make out. There's the odd laugh here and there, Ving Rhames does his usual solid support and Burt Reynolds is enjoyably sleazy as a perverted  congressman. What makes the movie is the beautiful and very sexy Moore, who  may not be able to act very well, but boy is she hot. Seeing her strip is  worth the price of the DVD alone, but beyond the gorgeous Demi there's an  entertaining almost-satire to be had - but who needs that when you've got  an (almost) naked Demi. It may be the cinematic equivalent of a night out  at a strip joint, but what a night out...put this in your collection just  to see one of the sexiest women alive show just why she's so goddamn hot.  You'll need to cool down after this one...five stars just for the lovely  Demi.",948585600,6,820,4.342105263157895
33082,3,078062582X,"The reality is that any skin flick is going to get panned by the critics no matter how good they are.  This genera is not politically correct and we all know it.
  This movie was a part of Demi Moore's ongoing statement  about artistic limits.  The inane plot is not the focus of the movie.  The  purpose of the movie was to showcase Demi's body and it does a pretty good  job of that.
All the objections in previous reviews are valid, but they  miss the point.  It is too bad that the subject cannot be presented better  by writers, directors and producers, but they too appear constrained by  political correctness; the stripper has to be forced into the lifestyle and  must escape from it, etc. etc.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but  the banality of the plot is an unecessary drag on the film.  Demi could  have made a wider statement if she had, or was allowed, to expand on her  stated love of dancing or of  turning men on, which some strippers do.",944352000,8,963,4.308988764044944

33084,4,078062582X,"Although the plot is the same, nice girl intimidated by the bad guys, the story line is a bit off the beaten path.  There aren't alot of surprises, but the movie really takes off, so to speak, as it goes on.  Set in a  Florida dance club, the Eager Beaver no less, the supporting cast add a bit  of much needed humor to the plot, and most of the supporting cast is very  pleasing to the eye.  Burt Reynolds is very beliveable as the idiot  congressman, as is Vingh Rhames as the loveable club bouncer.  As I said,  not many surprises, but lots of fun.  The true Demi Moore fans will want to  pack a lunch for this one, because once won't be enough.",920419200,,648,4.145161290322581
33085,1,078062582X,"Just what the hell was Demi Moore trying to prove here?  That she knows how to make a truly worthless film?  What could have been a daring, provokative movie is rendered hopeless by an inept script.  At least Ving  Rhames and Burt Lancaster are fairly funny.",912729600,4,258,4.543478260869565

It is a straight transfer from film to BluRay, meaning it's like a high quality DVD in terms of video quality. Do not expect the incredible detail and enhanced color you'd get with a fully Digitally Remastered film to BluRay transfer. But, for $12, it's not a bad deal at all.

Like Showgirls, this movie is not the bad film critics make it out to be. It's actually a heartwarming story that tugs at the heart. What kind of a mother wouldn't do anything-and I mean, ANYTHING-for her child? The acting is very good. I'm glad Burt Reynolds shaved off his mustache for the part, as he was not only unrecognisable, but also because audiences probably wouldn't have liked him with the mustache in the film, given what happens at the end. The humour in the film is sprinkled throughout, and given the tone, it's appropriately twisted.

The book STRIPTEASE is no exception. The movie falls quite flat by comparison, which is surprising given the number and size of the bosoms in it.

33462,4,078062582X,"This movie is actually pretty funny. Its acting makes it hard to take it serious even at parts that in any other movie would be serious points. In this film Demi Moore plays Erin Grant a recently divorced mother who is unemployed from her desk job with the FBI. In a unfair custody ruling her criminal ex-husband gets custody of their daughter. In order to pay for the appeal Erin starts working at The Eager Beaver which is a strip club. Her problems proceed to get worse as a crooked politician falls head over heels for her and begins to romantically pursue her. As Erin finds herself wondering deeper and deeper into troubled waters she must make risky decisions to protect herself, her daughter, and their future together.

Striptease is a good movie, its not real high quality acting but i tend to believe that is intentional due to it is the only time i have ever seen some of the actors give such a 'unique' performance. It has plenty of funny moments and one liners where you get a decent laugh. It won't make you laugh until you cry but they will be decent laughs. This is a good popcorn movie that is enjoyable to watch. Its not going to gross you out, its not going to scare you, or keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. The plot is fairly predictable and easy to guess what will happen next. It will however offer decent entertainment to those who are willing to lower their nose and give it a chance.

The nudity in my opinion deserves its own paragraph. If your planning on buying this for the nudity then be warned you may be slightly disappointed while there is a good amount of it i wouldn't consider much of it extremely good. If your a Demi fan then you will love it because this is the only film i know of that she bares as much as she does in this film. There is plenty of nudity but i agree with the review written by The Hawk that the casting department did a good job making Demi one of the better looking girls in the movie.

I also agree with The Hawk on the statement that this movie does attempt to change some social stereotypes that plague strippers and related professions. Being someone who knows two strippers and also knowing a few women in the adult film industry i was happy to see a movie that tries to show that strippers are people and are just as human as anyone else. Many people forget that about strippers and in related fields (adult film industry) that the women in those occupations are still people who feel all the same emotions that the rest of us feel. It was nice to see a film that tries to show that they are not evil people but are just people.

This film is really funny and is fun to watch. It is not a movie to that will leave much of a long lasting impression on you. Meaning you it won't really change how you look at life. Other than what i mentioned above, it might make you realize strippers and women in related professions are not evil people. This is not a twisting thriller or a complex puzzle like Courage Under Fire it is just something that will entertain you with quirky acting, funny lines, and decent nudity.

To sum it up Striptease is a pretty good movie for the value. I give it 4/5 stars it is pretty good and a fun popcorn movie that is fun to watch over and over.",1349827200,,3251,4.2882736156351795

seen when it first came out years ago.  I couldn't even remember the movie so that says something about it.  The King could

run out of the alloted 'movie theatre time limit"" or b) ran out of money to finish it properly.  The end in the book was WAY better

I'd not been aware of the White Rose non-violent resistance to the Nazi regime until seeing this film.  Indeed, the full story of White Rose hadn't been known until original source material surfaced after the fall of East Germany in late 1989.

What struck me was the sheer bravery of the movement's young leaders, the brilliantly staged rendition of the Nazi show trial that followed their arrests and the finality of the quick, shocking punishment that is meted out.  In particular, the show trial scene is movie-making of the highest order with a knockout Downfall-esque performance by Andr Hennicke as Richter Dr. Roland Freisler.  The production design, too, is worthy of special note - the courtroom in the trial scene is spectacularly staged.

The film also serves as evidence that not all Germans marched in enthusiastic lockstep to the Nazi war machine.  Reviews accompanying the film's 2005 release relate that German audiences reacted very positively to the film, perhaps because it demonstrated the courage and dissent alive in the populace at that time.  Stars Julia Jentsch and Fabian Hinrichs (as Sophie's brother Hans) beautifully convey the passion, innocence and bravery of the Scholls.

It was only six days between arrest and conclusion.  The movie does a great job at conveying a rush to judgment that mocks the idea of jurisprudence.",1287792000,2,1435,5.068085106382979

33485,3,078062582X,"It's really unfortunate that most people know this brilliant story only as a mediocre film.  The story was adapted from an absolutely delightful novel written by Carl Hiassen of the Miami Herald.  Having read Strip Tease before seeing the movie, I enjoyed Striptease a lot more than most viewers.  I can understand how people would think the movie missed the mark if judged only by the movie.

Burt Reynolds plays Congressman Dilbeck almost exactly as he's portrayed in the book and he does a fantastic job in the role.  Ving Rhames does a great job playing the bouncer, Shad, at the Eager Beaver.  Unfortunately, the screenwriters' adapted screenplay attempts to make the Erin Grant role a bit more serious than she was in the book and, quite honestly, a more significant character than she was.  Given that ""Strip Tease"" the novel was a dark comedy, having any character delve into the seriously dramatic was not really something I feel Hiassen intended.

Whether talking about the book or the film, do note that this story isn't a sex-fest.  While the story does have a great number of scenes where the strip club is the setting, it's really done in such a way that it's not at all distasteful.  I think that while some of the scenes where Erin was dancing were dragged on for the moviegoers who were just there to see Demi nude, the filmmakers did a commendable job keeping it from becoming entirely about sex and I give them credit for that.  The story could have been slanted an entirely different direction with this kind of story.

I found the story to be plausible, but the bad acting and choppy story flow left much to be desired.  From what I understand, this movie was originally set as a drama, but it was turned into comedy for the sake of mass appeal.  If it was a drama it would have made a little more sense.

Demi Moore plays Erin, a single mom who is looking to make ends meet and keep custody of her daughter.  Like a lot of desperate women with no education or skills, she turns to the pole.  She's a likeable gal despite the sleaze and desperation a job and enviornment like this constitutes, and is completely drug free as well.  (Now we're talking fiction!)  Burt Reynolds, in the only true comic relief in this movie, is a senator who's a little off his meds one day when he sees Erin dancing and becomes obsessed with her, providing the one and only plot movement to see what will happen once they see each other again.  And there's some crime or something that they witness in between and there's a twist in it.  Or something.

THis was a vehicle for showing us Demi's buff and tumble body.  I admit, I hope I will look like her at age 40, let alone after one, let alone after THREE children.  And perhaps she wanted to make us a little jealous, but now I have every reason to be jealous since she's married to Ashton Kutcher 15 years her junior.  Still, it's a weak movie.

33490,2,078062582X,"...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for Worst Picture of the Decade?

I think, ""Striptease"" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness. The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver"" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers - after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material.

Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million - one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.

Demi Moore plays Erin, a mother that just got divorced from her sleazy of a husband (Robert Patrick of T2 fame), and has lost custody of her daughter (played by her real life daughter!)In order to get an appeal for the case Erin gose to work at a strip club, she becomes that clubs start dancer because she's hot and is a decent dancer, however her antics attract a crazed fan and a horny congressmen. Erin tries to use the congressmen to get her a far chance at getting her daughter back from her ex that like to steal wheel chairs, however, people near the congress men are afraid that Erin might something that could cause embarrassment tohim, and hurt some of his shady friends in the sugar industry.

Base off a hilarious book by Carl Hiassen, the movie is able to capture MOST of the people, story and humor of the book.  Although less endowed in the book, Demi is able to perform Hiassen's character with the beauty and intelligence we saw when we read the book, although the political undertones of Florida politics (Hiassen trade mark) are gone the movie dose do the book some justice compared to how other books that have been made into movies.

The plot is basically Demi Moore's character as a single mom who needs money so she works in a strip club (yes, stripping) and has men problems (crappy ex-husband, lecherous politician).

33502,5,078062582X,"Demi Moore was excellent in this film. She is not only a beautiful woman, not just body wise, but within her soul.
Demi plays a divorced woman, Erin Grant, who looses custody of her beloved daughter to a scumbag of an ex husband. (This is typical justice in the real world. I relate to this movie because it happened to me and I haven't seen my daughter for 13 years.)
Anyway, she had a respectful job at the FBI and looses it because of her husband's criminal activities. Then she looses her daughter because she doesn't have a job.
So she becomes an exotic dancer to make the money needed to get her daughter back. It's excellent money for her but she doesn't really like what she's doing. However, she performs with class and dignity, regardless of the stigmitism of ""strippers."" Ving Rhames, who is the bouncer Shad, has a soft spot in his heart for Erin. Anyone calling her a ""stripper"" will find a drill gun spinning at their forehead. She is a ""dancer.""
Burt Reynolds plays the corrupt, twisted Congressman who finds his ""angel"" (Erin) and persues her. There is legal snaffu's, funny scenes, and Erin is witty and courages because she will not give up on her daughter. Her love for her daughter is deep and real.
Demi learned to dance like an exotic dancer for this film and after just having a baby at the time, she looks great.
This film you will either like it or not. If you're looking for a lot of skin, T&A, this is not what you want. This film does have class. Demi's brief nudity in the film just proves that she is a confident woman and a great actress.",1082678400,58,1569,4.413793103448276

Ving Rhames, who I always love, did a superb job playing a no BS bodyguard. Burt Reynolds was hilarious. And Demi? Well, she got naked. That's about all I can say for her. The story was hugely predictable, and the acting was pretty bad, but this movie was really funny. There were some great one-liners.

33510,4,078062582X,"After reading the excellent book I just had to go out and get the movie.  I would say that except for a collapse at the end, this film does capture the essence and spirit of the movie.  And that's not an easy thing to do.  Carl Hiaasen's novel about the topless business in Florida walked a very fine line.  On one hand, just about everyone but Erin, played very well by Demi Moore, was portrayed as a loser to some degree under the biting pen of the author.  Yet he told a story that made these characters seems realistic.
The movie does  a much better job than I thought could be done with the subtle attitude of the story.  A lot of the reviews I've seen show that the reviewers who saw it just don't get it.  Yes, most of the characters are dumb and or evil, but they are done so in a sly, elegant manner.  Just about every character in the movie nails the book, except Stuart Pankin's dull portrayal of the sleazy lawyer.
There are two factors that keep it from five-star territory.  First, Hollywood does wimp out on the ending.  One of the fine things Hiassen does while keeping his characters funny is also to make some of them realistically dangerous.  These are nasty people, and while there is death in the movie, there was a lot more in the book.  Were they thinking of making a sequel?
The other factor, and I have to be a stickler about it, is that the book portrayed a nude club, and there's just not enough shots of the ladies the way I'd like to see them.  Some plot is just too important to leave out.",1045872000,15,1519,4.2473867595818815

33512,2,078062582X,"This movie is not a fully erotic movie as it might be expected. But it is not a clever and funny movie either. So what makes Striptease bad,I guess,is that it doesn't manage to satisfy any taste at all.
Erin Grant (Demi Moore) must strip for a living,and her biggest fight is against her ex-husband to get her little daughter back. Meanwhile a [physically excited] congressman (Burt Reynolds)gets fixated on her,a murder occurs and things get quite complicated.
Striptease has humor at times,but not much really happens. The plot,if there is any,is pretty weak. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is probably Demi Moore and her dancing on beautiful Eurythmics songs. However other than those ""music videos"",there is nothing else to care about in the movie. I wish Eurythmics used Demi on their videos,which would make making a movie like Striptease unnecessary.
The DVD doesn't have a single extra as it suffers from being an old release,so I can not show any reason why you should buy this DVD,except if you are a hardcore Demi fan..",1025568000,20,1051,4.877094972067039

First off, Demi Moore is naked.  Surprisingly, I didn't find her ""dance"" scenes too hot.  The silicone enhancement moves like a rock statue.

Anyone who knows strippers knows that most of them have children that they are trying to support at home. This movie is mostly realistic and honest. I think that the only reason it hasn't done better in review, and in the box office, is because this brand of honest reality is the kind that most people don't want to face or acknoweledge existance of. I applaud the makers of this film.. talk to a stripper (which im not) and you will find that this kind of thing is daily for them, customers get enthralled with them on a fantasy level, and it usually leads to drama.",984700800,2,751,4.489051094890511
33518,2,078062582X,"While not Carl Hiaasen's best novel -- I'd nominate ""Skin Tight"" or ""Native Tongue"" for that -- ""Strip Tease"" is far wiser, funnier and richer than the anemic film version by Demi Moore would have you believe.
Instead of FBI secretary-turned-stripper Erin being a strangely desexualized perfect being, in the novel, she's a complicated mess. In other words, a real human being. Her ex-husband is a piece of crap, yes, but not the cartoonish lout we see in the film. Really, everyone in a Hiaasen novel is a bit of a goofball, once their foibles are looked at unflinchingly, which is part of the fun.
Those only familiar with ""Strip Tease"" via the movie don't get any of that: The good guys are too good to screw up, and the bad guys are too stupid to have any redeeming qualities. And to top it all off, Demi apparently doesn't understand that stripping is meant to titillate, not spiritually enlighten its audience. Those aroused by the film ought to get out more.
In fact, the book tops the film in every way, with the possible exception of what Burt Reynolds brings to the film. But even then, in his role as a corrupt politician -- and, ultimately, the engine for the story -- punches are pulled and he's not quite as sleazy as in the book. Apparently, giving people a lesson into how greed is destroying the Everglades was just too heavy for the film audience.
Those who liked the film -- and they exist, strangely enough -- still ought to pick up the book, to learn all about the characters and read the situations that didn't make the final cut. For current fans of Hiaasen's work, the book is roughly on par with ""Stormy Weather,"" although much more politically barbed than that work, which took aim at humanity's folly generally.
And for Demi Moore, what were you thinking? You owe Carl and his fans a big apology, as well as your own fans, who deserve better.",976060800,3,1869,4.565476190476191

The strip scenes were convincing and pretty well done (although by far not the best they could have been, in my opinion), and there were some cute scenes with the girl.  Otherwise I wasn't much impressed with this movie.  It delivers what it promises- Demi Moore's (and some other nameless actress') half-naked bodies.

moore's character in this film, is remarkable cause she makes friends with ppl at a job at a club

and when u compare the erin grant character to moore's earlier character in disclosure
apparently what could have given this film, a slight more humor is if she was in the same position as the michael douglas character in disclosure was, meaning, that yes she cares about her child and works at this bar, but she should have also understood that if a judge in this film is flat out crooked, along with a disrespectful ex husband, who obviously sees her daughter, and the aid to a congressman played by burt reynolds, who sounds to me like she should have gotten way way way way more help from :the detective character by armand assante, not to mention the two sidekicks that seem to like talking to her, including that bouncer played by ving rhames, if they had in this film, used some slight disclosure referneces even for a comedy, then the ex husband wouldnt have got away with the clueless ridiculous nonsense involving keeping her daughter under some sort of divorce order, and then of course, she could have decided to keep her new job rather than being forced back in to the fbi job
which to us, the viewers, seems like she should have been given a choice, and she should have chose to work at the bar more, rather than wanting her fbi job , and i kinda have appreciation for this movie, a lot more than disclosure, cause, moore's character is totally sympathetic of her kid, and she wants to do what she can to keep her safe, this film is truly wonderful, especially when u see moore with her kid",1521072000,,1749,4.5
