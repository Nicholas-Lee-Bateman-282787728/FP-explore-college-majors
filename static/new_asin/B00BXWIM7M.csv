5681415,4,B00BXWIM7M,"Don't let the jacket of this DVD mislead you. This is not a dungeon-torture flick. Most of the action takes place in an artist's lovely loft apartment and involves more realistic relationships.

It's true that this ground has been covered in many other movies, including the similarly named ""Wait Until Dark."" A blind woman is threatened by someone whose full intentions she cannot see. But this movie does include some uniquely chilling shots. Look at what happens to the family pictures on the artist's wall.

The first 3/4 of the film takes its time unpeeling the extent of the villain's derangement. Then the pace of the film switches to a rather abrupt realization and resolution. It's as if the directors feared they might be running out of film and wanted to cover the essential elements of the plot as quickly as possible.

Despite this final yank on the viewer's leash though, this remains a worthwhile, effective thriller. I watched several high-budget Hollywood thrillers the same week that I saw this film. Despite it's low-budget, made-for-TV production values, it won my award for the best of these new releases. It contained the most true-to-life threat and held my attention the most consistently.",1372291200,4,1213,5.024875621890548

8575201,3,B00BXWIM7M,"Note: This is not a horror film, despite the cover art and dvd imprint art. It is a thriller/ psychological thriller. But, it is a very slow-moving film.

The director remained focused like a laser beam on the specific intent of the story:  a blind woman is being ""stalked"" by her overly-possessive male aid. The film is well-acted, the dialog is good (meaning that the actors talk like real people would), and it is well-photographed. My complaints are two-fold:
1) Very slow-moving. The transition from ""normal aid worker helping his blind client"" moves along very subtly to "" lunatic possessive guy seeking exclusive possession of his blind client."" No particular rhyme or reason is suggested for this transformation.

2) The aid worker, though he was obsessed with his blind client, had no reason to ""stalk"" her. He could have just as easily developed a true romantic relationship with her in the natural course of events. In fact, at the beginning, the blind woman seemed to be interested in developing such a relationship -- but he quashed it. And, she took it to mean that he wasn't interested in her beyond their professional relationship. He continues to deny there is anything other than a client- caregiver relationship when the subject is brought up by the neighbor across the street.
So, this is a major flaw in the telling of this tale. The background, psychological details, etc. of the caregiver aid was glossed over (or left on the cutting room floor). The motive behind his actions is therefor left completely unaddressed. Had the character and his motives or background or psychology been fully explored (or even partially explored) this would have been a very effective psychological thriller. But, in its present form, it simply remains incomplete.",1464134400,,1769,5.010204081632653

8575205,3,B00BXWIM7M,"Ali Lear (Elisabeth Rhm) loses her family and eye sight in an accident. She gets assigned Jeff (Sam Page) to help her adjust. Jeff has spent his life with a blind mother. Jeff takes advantage of the situation and becomes a possessive voyeur.

This is a well acted film, but didn't make much sense as his relationship with Ali could have escalated to another level making his sneaking around totally unnecessary. Not overly entertaining as it is slow developing and goes practically nowhere.

Redbox lists this as a horror film while IMDB has it as a drama which is closer to the truth.

8575206,5,B00BXWIM7M,"Luv horror, suspence, sci-fi and anything that resembles them. This is pretty dam good I'd even watch it again. I'm known for my numerous watch times. I've watched Avatar about 10 times now. My fav horror flicks about 20 times and Hitchcock all classics I just don't get tired of them. Freddie and Jason oh yea bring them on watched all of those at least 20 times over.",1381449600,,369,4.4411764705882355
