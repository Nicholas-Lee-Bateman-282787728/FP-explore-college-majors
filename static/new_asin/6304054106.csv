787478,4,6304054106,"This was one of my Favorite Ghost Story Books!  I some how missed this movie.  Now that I have seen it I am glad I was missing it!

This movie is not the book.  If you have read Haunted then stay away from this movie unless you are so curious, you just have to see it, or maybe you wish to see Beautiful Actress in it.  You really have to want to see this film to watch it if your read the book.

Where to began.  Let's start in the beginning, shall we.  The beginning of this film is absolutely horrible, the pacing is wrong, the music for the film is wrong.  The film uses this cheezy romance theme with sevenths as broken chords in the bass, and it doesn't fit the film at all.
There is one part where it's sweet(when they dance in that room with the piano),
other then that this is a score that does not create the proper atmosphere except for a silly romance movie.

I am really amazed at how bad the beginning is.  The pacing is just horrible it's as if they were trying to cram as much as possible
into the intro so they could fill out the rest of the book in the movie.  It is really bad!  Honestly just skip to him getting off the train.

This film had so potential!!  Both Robert and Simon are spot on! I love those characters.  The plot of this film is sort of close to the books but
changes so many things it is different beast.  It's more of a romance story then anything called Haunted.  It has it's moments and they are sweet but it misses the whole point of Haunted.

The story of this movie is plain silly, compared to the awesome story of the Book Haunted.

I love the estate, it fits the books well.  The atmosphere could have been a lot better in the movie.

The acting is really good in the movie Christina and Robert really stand out.  The more I think about it all I can say is this was a total let down.

See Awakening, Others, Devils Backbone, Innocence, if you wish to see a good ghost movie.  still hunting for great Ghost films.

I watched this again with a detachment away from the Book and it is a good Love Ghost Story.  It has good acting and the theme works well for the love story.  The Music is little Flat and could have done with better orchestra arrangement(not enough Cress to the main theme romance theme)
over all it is a really good Ghost movie and I do recommend it.  Honestly though I think you should watch it from him learning about the Place in his office.
A better ghost movie that is different is The Changling with George C Scott and his wife.",1473120000,,2493,4.146137787056367

787480,5,6304054106,"""haunted"" along with the film ""uncovered"" are two of my very favorite films starring kate beckinsale. either seem to be more from the romantic side of things which make the films that much more appealing. as always kate beckinsale lights up the screen.

I just purchased the book and I am sure there are those who will like the book better...however, I thought the movie was excellent...more of a mature/adult audience. This movie is not for teenagers because it will make you think...and I just read an article that the attention span of a teenager is 5 minutes.",1455753600,2,652,4.533898305084746
787482,5,6304054106,"Good story line but this movie has been altered from it true story. In an old film this was called the Tiara if I am correct. It was the boy who teased the girl and stole her crown. Yes, they were fraternal twins. Then she fell in the lake because he took the Tiara. There were not 3 siblings and the boy felt guilty and jealous of his sister and had some physiological issues from it and went on a killing spree in the castle. In the end, he was found dressing in a girls dress, wig and Tiara with an ax in his hand.
This film was good and entertaining but the ending could of been better. IMO",1455494400,,594,4.0

787484,1,6304054106,"HAUNTED, classic supernatural Horror from the 90's
Still waiting for a blu-ray release or a proper dvd release in widescreen format
this U.S. dvd release from over 15 years ago now is only in 1:33:1 Full screen format
plus has no extras at all, except for theatical trailer
plus the picture quality is pretty bad i can only assume it's VHS transfer Digitally remastered a little
shocking effort i must say for a classic thriller like this film
if you want to watch this film in bigger screen format than 1:33:1 full screen
and much better picture quality and some extras
you'll have to buy the German dvd version by Kinowelt which has English language option in 2.0 stereo anyway
Kinowelt have given the film a much bigger screen ratio for sure 1:66:1 ratio much better than a 1:33:1 fullscreen
a 1:85:1 ratio would be excellent, but kinowelt extended the ratio to 1:66:1 at least
plus the picture quality is very Good, much better than the U.S. transfer
plus kinowelt also added some extras, making of promo featurette & the Theatrical trailer of course
check amazon Germany for the listing, this dvd has amazon.de listing so you can get it shipped express courier to you
the French dvd is the same 1:66:1 ratio with English language option & making of promo extras
 check amazon france for the listing
i think the Dutch dvd version has the screen ratio even bigger than 1:66:1 ratio, but not sure
i've seen photos of the Dutch dvd on amazon uk
German , french Dutch dvd's are all region 2
you do need all regions player for the region 2 dvd
pretty stupid effort this U.S. Distributor has only given the film 1:33:1 full screen transfer and no extras except for trailer
and yet the European Distributors have given the film more respect with bigger wider screen ratio & extras
does that make sense!
so your better buying the German dvd or french dvd for a bigger screen ratio & extras, your Decision

787648,3,6304054106,"I was excited to order this movie because everybody said it was one of the classics, a 'must see'.  I watched it and got bored fast.  I'm a huge scary movie fan (without the gore) and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more scary excitement.  It was full of odd things that kept getting stranger and stranger until in the end the secret of the movie is revealed in a rather anticlimactic way, since you have been suspecting it since the beginning.  Then again I think I've read the book before in my horror book collection, so I knew what was coming.  It's like the people that made it thought their audience was gonna be a bunch of second graders, so they drop hints throughout the movie making the final twist obvious.  Just a warning I didn't initially see a label rating the movie, but after viewing I'm assuming it's rated R.  I was shocked at the amount of nudity.  It seemed that every scene had a long drawn out nude scene until eventually It was a surprise to actually see some of the actors wearing clothes.  Although I love Kate Beckinsale I was disappointed that she played such a loose character (in other words (and please forgive me) her character was a serious 'slut')  If I wanted to see that I would just go back and relive high school.  Since the movie had such a great cast, and since some of the scenes were actually entertaining I give this movie three stars.  Still wish I hadn't spent the money on it.  Do yourself a favor and read the book, it's far more scary.",1401926400,,1497,4.380434782608695

The movie deals with a professor that has the goal to disprove all ghost stories. He travels to an old English manor in Sussex to disprove one old ladies belief that ghosts haunt the manor. As it turns out, the professor meets the various ghost and interacts with them as normal living people, not aware of their special status. At the end, he has to face the fact that he has spent days with these ghosts and accepting them as normal.

Kate is especially good looking and has many naked scenes in the movie. She even has a romantic night with the professor. She never looked better than in Haunted.",1395187200,,855,4.509677419354839

787743,5,6304054106,"So, New Years Eve, and I found myself alone in the house. I ask you, what better way to ring in the new year than to immerse oneself in a ghost movie? Maybe the ghost can be a metaphor for the death of the old year.

Or maybe thats reaching.

At any rate, I rented Haunted, a 1995 movie with a starring cast including Sir John Gielgud, Kate Beckinsale, and Aidan Quinn. Professor Ash, a ghost debunker, journeys to the country estate Edbrook at the request of a troubled housekeeper who begs him to rid the mansion of ghosts. Once the professor arrives, however, the housekeeper grows more troubled and cannot even tell him who the ghosts are or what they want. To find answers, David Ash lays his ghost traps and involves himself in the lives of the estates heirscontrolling brother Robert, impish brother Simon, and the alluring sister Christina.

David Ash has his own past, a past that haunts him. (And how great a name is Ash for a story of death and ghosts?) He blames himself for the accidental death of his twin when they were children. He is drawn to the close-knit siblings of the manor and soon finds himself falling for beautiful, mysterious Christina. All these elements play into the dark psychological tale that director Lewis Gilbert develops.

And here is what I loved most about this movie.

Unlike modern ghost movies (Haunted was produced in 1995 and based on a 1988 book by James Herbert) that devolve into a monster fest, Haunted remains an old fashioned ghost tale (albeit one with a twisted psychology) that chills and awakens rather than deadening the viewer with demonic rage, projectile vomit, and overblown special effects. Also fun is the period set piece. Haunted takes place in the 1930s (oh, the luscious costumes!) with occasional flashbacks to 1905.

So, a movie from the past about the past. What better way to look to the future?

As you have probably guessed, I recommend this movie. Watch it today and bid adieu to the ghost of 2013. Incidentally, author James Herbert died in March, in the thirteenth year of this century.",1388534400,,2061,4.692520775623269

787746,4,6304054106,"Having read the book and watched the movie, I have to wonder if those involved making the movie even read the book?  With all the changes they made with regards to the book, one wonders why they bothered with it at all...they changed so many important things...the main thing being the relationship between David Ash and his sister...it was not a loving relationship, at all.  I realize Hollywood always ""adds to and takes away"" when making movies from books...but what they did with Haunted was just too much.

787820,5,6304054106,"""Haunted: The Ferryman"" was part of ITV's 1974 Haunted series which comprised only 2 dramas, the other being ""Poor Girl"". I did not enjoy ""Poor Girl"" as much as I enjoyed ""The Ferryman"", both of which I watched online at a streaming website. ""The Ferryman"" has an interesting premise and the acting is compelling. Jeremy Brett plays author Sheridan Owen whose debut novel, ""The Ferryman"", has garnered critical acclaim. To get away from it all, Sheridan and his wife, Alex (Natasha Parry) go to the countryside where they come across an inn and decide to stay the night. Before long, Sheridan notices some strange coincidences between the people and surroundings at the inn and his own novel and it appears like his novel is coming to life. Given that the antagonist in ""The Ferryman"" is a deranged killer, this does not bode well for the Owens.

The story is atmospheric and the suspense builds up slowly but surely. Both Brett and Parry do an excellent job in their respective roles, especially Brett. His natural skepticism about supernatural phenomenon gradually gets ripped apart when he realizes the events he is experiencing cannot be rationalized. The ending is open-ended and leaves the viewer wondering what will happen next. It is a classic thriller with shades of the supernatural and will appeal to fans of the genre.",1369180800,2,1330,4.9375

I finally remembered one of the key stars, Anthony Andrews, and started to review his films and came across the title that I remembered. I also remember trying to find this film at Blockbuster locations in the Chicago Area with no luck. Using amazon.com made it easy once I filled in my memory blanks. The DVD quality rated 4 stars out of 5 , with the only disappointment being a bit of DVD disc glitch that I noticed in the end credits. I also was interested in receiving by Halloween and the advertisement from the provider through amazon.com (Amazing Media) promised if ordered by 10/27/11, that I could receive by Halloween. Unfortunately even with Express Delivery, the DVD arrived Wednesday, November 2nd, which was disappointing.

787914,4,6304054106,"Haunted is a bit deceiving in name.  You fully expect it to focus entirely on scares and suspenseful moments involving spirits, but that's not what actually happens.

Instead, it's more like a love story that develops between a British man and a woman, and it moves along at a *very* slow pace.  This film could basically fall under the category of a love story to be honest.

The actual scares are few and far between, but when they do occur (such as a certain sudden explosion scene, along with a fire segment taking place much later) the movie does make you feel a *little* frightened.

Anyway, it's about a British man who doesn't believe in ghosts at all, so he spends some time in a castle, meets a woman (along with a few other people including a nanny) and the storyline takes off from there.  There's just WAY too many quiet and unmemorable segments to really recommend this film to horror lovers.

The best moment actually comes from the very beginning when the British man is able to prove that a psychic reading is a scam.  Too bad it takes over an hour and a half for the next best moment to make an appearance.

However, the reason I give the film a rating of 4 out of 5 is because of an EXTREMELY big storyline twist at the end that basically saves the movie.  Without that twist, I'd probably give Haunted a rating of a 2 since the majority of it is quite dull.

That twist is a major one though, and besides that, only the nanny with her strong belief in ghosts would save the storyline otherwise.

I guess you have to be really patient in order to enjoy Haunted and be open-minded to lengthy love scenes.  Otherwise you'll just end up sorely disappointed.",1279152000,,1673,4.428104575163399

788040,3,6304054106,"I find myself conflicted writing offering this review. I found the movie entertaining and the plot with some mystery (not a bad ending), yet the premise for the plot seemed to derive from a combination of formulas used many times over. Still, other than some seemingly unrealistic, or unsensical events, the movie does captivate interest. On to some of the details (contains spoilers)...

Overall, the casting and actors'perfomances provide a solid anchoring of a quality production (Aidan Quinn, Kate Beckinsale, et al). The scenery was well chosen, but I wonder if more dramatic lighting would have set a more frightening mood. Most scenes seemed too well lit. Also, in some of the more dramatic moments that should have created a more drastic reaction, the object of the 'scare' was opaque or in the periphery. I draw reference to the scene where the professor emerges from the house of the family doctor/confident, where he seems to spy something that captures his bewilderment. The camera pans over a scene on a hill where, seemingly, nothing is worth notice! I had to reexamine the scene and freeze to capture the existence of the ghost of the little girl standing off to the far side and blurred. Other scenes left me scratching my head as to the reality of the situation. In one sequence, Kate brings Aidan to a small house on the property, which, supposedly, her mother loved to spend time. While there, a rocking chair starts rocking, to little comment or notice from the two! Also, how did a supposed ghost drive the car to pick up the professor at the train station (unobserved) or around the property? Why didn't the nanny reveal her situation earlier, in fuller detail? All of these things (and more) could have been addressed better with a more thorough scrutiny of the plot by the director.

This film is worth a view and you will find it entertaining, but don't place credence in the comparison to such supernatural classics as 'the changeling','the legend of hell house', and 'ghost story', it isn't even close. 'Haunted' is an upgrade from 'the others' and a few others, but not a classic.

788042,3,6304054106,"Haunted (Lewis Gilbert, 1995)

I'm a sucker for a good James Herbert adaptation. They are few and far between, especially given that Herbert is, in his native England, the rough equivalent of Stephen King on this side of the pond. He's written any number of spine-chilling novels, and every one I've ever read, including this one, have been fantastic. And yet only four of Herbert's novels have been adapted--The Survivor in 1981, The Rats (as Deadly Eyes) in 1982, and then both Fluke and Haunted in 1995. Please, someone, adapt a few more.

Haunted is the story of David Ash (Aidan Quinn), a professor and skeptic in Britain who is invited out to the supposedly-haunted Edbrook House to chronicle the supposedly paranormal activity there. While he's not too sure about the ghosts, he's certainly bewitched by young Christina Marielle (Kate Beckinsale), who lives there with her brothers Robert (Anthony Andrews, recently of Last Night) and Simon (The Discovery of Heaven's Alex Lowe). The three of them, very close, are presided over by their nanny (Affinity's Anna Massey), and are visited regularly by a local doctor (Sir John Gielgud), but are otherwise pretty much cut off from society. While David is initially amused by the somewhat archaic nature of life at Edbrook, he does eventually start to realize that there are some pretty weird things happening there that have nothing at all to do with isolation.

I'm not a huge fan of either Quinn or Gilbert, but I'm willing to put up with almost anything for a Herbert adaptation. While Gilbert does go a little over the top with the special effects in a scene or two, Quinn pulls off what may be the role of his career here. He's skeptical, but faced with something he doesn't understand. He's trying to be tough as nails, faced with trying to keep his faith to a girlfriend at home while being tempted with one of the most beautiful women he's ever seen, one who's obviously interested in him. I've always thought of Quinn as one of those flat-affect actors who can't play anything but himself, but he brings a low-key current to this role that's just as electric as the current running through the house that may or may not be haunted. Beckinsale looks just as good in lacy frills as she does in skintight leather, and fans of her beauty will be gratified with the amount of time she also spends out of those lacy frills. Andrews and Lowe do a sufficient job of playing the good cop/bad cop routine, and Massey is just awesome, as she usually is. (Sir John's performance goes unremarked not because it's in any way pale, because he's Sir John Gielgud. Can you imagine him giving a bad performance?)

All this said, Haunted doesn't hold a candle to The Survivor; Gilbert and screenwriter Timothy Prager seem far more interested in the romance aspect of the screenplay most of the time, rather than the supernatural aspects, and as a result the movie plays out more like a costume drama than it does a ghost story. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when you're seeing a James Herbert adaptation, you expect the ghosts to come fast and thick (as well as the deviance, which is tastefully understated here; that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your point of view). Still, not bad. Look at it as a romance with supernatural elements instead of a horror flick, and you'll have a good time with it. ***",1246147200,2,3378,4.701013513513513

The ghost story takes a backseat to the love story, so if that's your thing, you may really enjoy this, but from a horror fan's perspective, I found the whole thing to be very blah.",1241481600,2,499,4.617977528089888
788045,2,6304054106,"This is an odd movie. It's a fairly basic premise: a wealthy trio of dilettante siblings ask a cynical paranormal investigator (suffering from his own demons) to come and exorcise their beloved childhood nanny, who is plagued by ghosts and careening towards the boobyhatch. When he arrives at Stock Stately Home, things go (literally) bump in the night and suddenly the cynic is confronted with that which he has always decried. And et ceterah.

The first and most commendable thing about ""Haunted"" is that there's a very fine sense of creeping dread and several elegant scares to be had over the course of the first hour of this movie. Several scenes, not least the opening with its two very competent child actors, jump from the screen and speak to a very high standard.

Unfortunately, for every decent, well-filmed moment in ""Haunted"", there's a corresponding boring and/or unintentionally funny moment to counteract the sense of terror. Director Lewis Gilbert's lack of consistency is as confusing as it is detrimental to the overall effectiveness of ""Haunted"" - witness the mounting dread of David's (Aidan Quinn) first night in Edbrook House completely undermined by the appalling special effect sequence of his second night: it looks more like a commercial for some sort of salt-based floor cleanser than anything else. A wonderful set-piece involving a piano playing in an abandoned music room is similarly undone by David's positively gymnastic leap from a car towards the film's end... ...confusingly, ""Haunted"" seems to be saying, ""Look, I know I can be great, but you're just going to have to sit there and put up with mediocre. Boo!!"".

The acting here suffers from the same bipolarity of standard: on one hand, Quinn and Kate Beckinsale have a believable chemistry together and neither of them does much wrong - but on the other hand, the grinning foolishness of Alex Lowe and the downright laziness of Brideshead Reunited (Anthony Andrews and a surprisingly underused John Gielgud) make for tiresome, vanilla viewing.

This movie lacks a basic sense of direction. When it's good, it's excellent: when it's bad (and it is more bad than good: the end is tired and predictable, the visual effects laughable even for 1996, and there are LOTS of continuity goofs, in addition to the plain sloppy scenes) it's pretty unwatchable.

Great alternatives include 1989's ""The Woman In Black"", 1963's ""The Innocents"" and, of course, ""The Others"". Each of these movies delivers something in spades that ""Haunted"" fatally lacks: quality. Avoid this one unless you choose to see it on TV.",1217548800,,2588,5.08
788046,3,6304054106,"I guess these movies with the twist on them is becoming old news, because I guessed from only a few minutes into the plot what the outcome was going to be, and I guessed it right. And my suspicions grew stronger as the movie unveiled a few more clues to it's final outcome.

However, even tho I predicated what was going to happen in the end, there was a few twist and turns that I could not work out, and kept watching to find out where it was going, and that was enough to keep me interested from start to end of this story of a writer who is invited to a house to meet an elderly woman who was the nanny of of the house's 3 children. (The people who owned the house, not the house itself)

She claims she has been seeing ghosts and the house is haunted. Yet the 2 brothers and daughter she has helped to raise all there lives think she is just crazy.

So this man who has written many ghost stories based on the facts, who has never really encountered a ghost and claims they are non existent, stays with them in the house for a couple of days, to investigate and discovers there are in fact strange things happening in this house.

He suspects there may be someone behind it at first, but discovers much more then he ever expected to by the end of this film.

------

As I said, I worked out very early in the film the outcome result of who certain characters and there story really where, but there are a lot of other things I did not predict, and it keeps you guessing to the end if your thoughts are right, or if it's something else.

If you care, I thought it was going to turn out that 2 of the characters where married and lying about there status etc.. but I guessed that one wrong. So if your someone who easily works out outcomes before they happen like I sometimes do, then I'd urge you to check this one out as it can confuse and trick you into one belief throwing you off the track your think it is going to in some aspects of the plot.

On the scare factor, I don't think it's on the creepy or spooky side of film making at all. It's more of a mystery film surrounding the supernatural then anything else really, don't expect blood and gore and terrifying scares from the walking dead, it's a clean mystery that slowly unravels as it proceeds with interesting twists and tales, yet very predicable for some like me, but even with that said, I still think it was a very enjoyable movie.

At the behest of an old lady who previously worked as a nanny in an old country manor in the English countryside, Davod goes there to help her resolve the question of whether or not there are spirits haunting the manor.

788114,4,6304054106,"Although the dreadful Pearl Harbor put British actress Kate Beckinsale on everyone's radar, before that she did the far superior Haunted.  An impressive film featuring big stars, based on a James Herbert novel, and executive produced by (among others) Francis Ford Coppola.

Haunted opens in 1905, in the picturesque English countryside, when a young David Ash (Peter England) inadvertently kills his sister, Juliet (Victoria Shalet).  During a moment of horseplay, she strikes her head and falls into a stream.  David jumps in to rescue her, but fails.  Juliet drowns.

Flash forward to 1928, and the adult David (Aidan Quinn) is now an Oxford professor and professional skeptic.  He not only discounts ghostly sightings in his well-received book, he spends off-campus hours exposing charlatan spiritualists.  Although he's still haunted by guilt and grief, he's accepted his sister's death; now he wants to help others rid their emotional crutches of belief in an afterlife.  It's more than a job; it's his calling.

So renowned an author is David, he is deluged by fan mail, including from the elderly but wealthy ""Nanny Tess"" Webb (Anna Massey), who asks David to exorcise her country manor of ghosts.  Dismissive at first, David is convinced to try and help the old woman by his kindly secretary.  Not to rid the manor of ghosts, but to prove to Nanny Tess that there are none, and to convince her to seek therapy.

Upon arriving in the country, David is met by Nanny Tess's niece, Christina (Kate Beckinsale).  David soon meets Christina's brothers (Anthony Andrews and Alex Lowe), and the hauntings begin.

Complicating matters, whatever spirits are tormenting Nanny Tess are now joined by a rival ghost, that of David's long-dead sister, Juliet, whom only David can see.  Just as, at times, only Nanny Tess can see her ghosts.

Further complicating matters is a burgeoning love between David and Christina.  Complicated, because it inflames the jealousies of Christina's older brother, who paints nude portraits of Christina.  The other brother prefers to spy on Christina, when he's not skinny-dipping with her.  And Christina, well, she's not as innocent as David may like to believe.  (If you're hankering for nude scenes of Beckinsale, this film delivers.)  Those English aristocrats do have their dark wild side, and it is the Roaring Twenties, and David can be such a square...

And yet, despite its risqu? content, Haunted has the ambiance of an old-fashioned English ghost story.  Languid pace, period piece decor, classy English accents, rich musical soundtrack, sumptuous cinematography of the English countryside.  If Merchant Ivory were to do a horror film, it would look like Haunted.

Yes, there is enough ghostly terror to please horror fans.  But there are also lyrical interludes of horseback riding along the white cliffs of Dover in glorious telephoto, lovers galloping through autumnal colored woods, then tumbling in the hay in some absent yeoman farmer's barn.  And capping an afternoon so visually resplendent it could be used for a high-fashion photo shoot, along comes a rustic fortune-teller.  Her red weather-beaten face and peasant teeth evoke so much local charm, we expect the romantic interlude to end with a prediction of marriage for our young lovers.  But instead, the fortune-teller's ominous palm reading (reminiscent of the one in Jacob's Ladder) returns the story to unsettling terror.

Haunted has many unexpected twists, especially as events cascade in the final reel, culminating in a surprise revelation that packs a powerful punch.  David's final discovery is an unexpected shock, yet it all suddenly makes sense.

Much as in The Sixth Sense.

Haunted is an obscure film, especially compared to the wildly successful Sixth Sense.  Yet it's hard to believe that Haunted did not influence The Sixth Sense.

Odds are most Americans didn't know of Kate Beckinsale until she appeared in Pearl Harbor.  In previous films, I found Beckinsale's onscreen persona to be both compelling and annoying (e.g., Cold Comfort Farm, The Last Days of Disco).  In Haunted, Beckinsale is ... compelling and annoying.  Compelling, because she is attractive, occasionally even sympathetic.  Annoying, because her characters are often persnickety, and always conceited, scheming, and manipulative.

This is not to describe Beckinsale, but it's the role she often plays.  (She was nobler in Pearl Harbor, but also blander.)

But David Ash is the main character in Haunted, and Aidan Quinn effectively predominates the film.  His David is sympathetic, courageous, sensitive, multi-textured, buffeted by events as he struggles to understand and aid and comfort, fighting for new love while still grappling with guilt and grief over his past.

Quinn and Beckinsale both perform splendidly, but so too the entire cast.  One expects slick craftsmanship from a Merchant Ivory film, and Haunted delivers that (although not a Merchant Ivory film).  But Haunted also succeeds as an entertaining and atmospheric English ghost story, full of mystery and terror and suspense, and a powerful surprise ending.",1144800000,15,5121,5.273176761433869

The only actor miscast here is Aidan Quinn who proves once again that he is much better in supporting roles than trying to sustain interest in his character throughout the film.  If I have to pick a standout performance it would be Kate Beckinsale who is so seductive that my eyes were drawn to her presence in every scene regardless of the prowess of the other actors.  By the end of the story it's almost scary how alluring she is, as if any man coming across her character would do well to bolt in the opposite direction, but he would fail to do so due to her vampiric charm.  I wanted to point out flaws in the filmmaking, itself, but in retrospect some of the scenes were purposely confusing.  Sufficed to say, if you go with the flow and you don't get bogged down by the slow pace of the movie some pleasant surprises are on the way.  There are some flaws here and there, like the obvious body-double used for Aidan Quinn in a stimulating scene with Kate Beckinsale; I think Kate did the scene herself, but one never knows these days.  This movie is worth checking out if you like a cerebral ghost tale loaded with British-style acting that relies more on subtelty than bombast.",1137801600,3,1310,4.4978902953586495
788116,4,6304054106,"An early film featuring Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale. The premise is quite simple: a man who whose sister died when he was young has dedicated his entire life to disproving the existence of paranormal and psychic phenomena. The movie takes place in the 1920s, and makes excellent use of the English countryside to set the tone for the film.

The film also excels at using the interactions of its main characters (aside from Quinn) to create a disturbing sense that something is wrong. Quinn goes to a house out in the country to help a woman who claims she is being tormented by ghosts. Nanny Tess (eerily portrayed by Anna Massey) lives in her estate with her three grandchildren (Kate Beckinsale, Anthony Andrews, and Alex Lowe), all of whom seem more than slightly off-kilter in a manner which may or may not be attributed to that peculiar form of pleasant British snobbery.

Whether or not there actually are ghosts is, of course, the main plot of the movie, and true to the genre it dances around the question for a good length of time before finally answering it. Suffice it to say that while a little predicatble, the final unraveling is still quite fun to watch.

The copy is not very good, but it's decent, they didn't do a great job parsing it to DVD and it doesn't have any interesting extra features. Still it looks OK and provides Over an hour and a half of great entertainment. Enjoy.",1128643200,5,744,4.246478873239437

Perhaps more provoking than scary, and being original that way for a ghost story -though I must add that the outcome of the twist plot was a bit too predictable. This being said; I wasn't bored, and that says a lot too about a movie without loads of special effects to ""spice it all up"", but instead dependent on its' story and actors. And both working out well. Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale both fit for their parts. I like movies involving haunted mansions and ghost stories, and though this is far from being ""Sixth Sence"" in both production and screenplay, I was entertained and curious.

But despite all the high rates here on the page for this movie I recommend horror-fans to moderate their expectations -and keep in mind that this is a tv-movie, and indeed so in design when it comes to quality on sound and picture.",1128470400,4,888,4.656050955414012
788180,4,6304054106,"""Haunted"" is a great romantic spookshow, set in the earlier part of the 20th century and involving a college professor/'paranormal debunker' (for whom a personal tragedy early in life has led him, oddly enough, not to hope for a 'better beyond' but to spend much of his life strenuosly trying to disprove the existance of anything otherworldly), played by Aidan Quinn, called upon to investigate a great manor deep in the English countryside and lay to rest once and for all any suspicion of a haunting.  The great house is inhabited by three siblings (including the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) and their troubled grandmother, who is the one who seems to believe something supernatural is afoot.  Beckinsale's role is her most revealing that I've seen by far (a definate highlight) and her performance is among the best she's delivered, enough to be immensely memorable even without the welcome exposure.  And Anna Massey as ""Nanny"", as her grandchildren call her, is superb in her role as a frightened older lady who's either delusional or is seeing things that no one else can...or will admit to if they are.

  Romantic, scray, sexy, dramatic and mysterious with a shocker ending, this is a movie that cries out for a sequel.  After a decade I don't know if the chances for that are good or not but I do have some good news to report on that front: author James Herbert, who wrote the novel ""Haunted"" from which this movie sprang, also wrote a followup called ""The Ghosts Of Sleath"", which I'm not sure if is a direct sequel or a followup in the sense of just having a couple of the characters turn up in a brand new story.  Obviously I haven't read it yet, but it's definately on my 'Must-Get' list, and other fans of the movie may want to give it a look too.

  The only minus for ""Haunted"" (in my opinion) occurs in the latter going and I can't therefore can't discuss.  Don't be put off by that, it's a very well-done part but it's one of those cases where, subjectively, I would have preferred the movie to take a diiferent fork in the road than the one it chose.  On the other hand, there's another, truly awesome, twist toward the end I Really appreciated.  A great movie; hugely recommended.

788182,5,6304054106,"For fans of Kate Beckinsale the movie ""Haunted"" is certainly a guilty pleasure - why guilty, not because it's a bad movie  but simply because the young British actress has more nudity in this picture than in all her other movies combined.
Two years prior to this movie Beckinsale has her first topless scene in the movie ""Uncovered,"" and here she throws all caution to the wind - along with most of her clothes. It's a somewhat uncharacteristically scary movie from Lewis Gilbert, the man who gave us some of the silliest James Bond movies such as ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Moonraker.""
In this 1996 movie the ever-watchable Aidan Quinn plays Dr. Ash, a skeptic who accepts the invitation to investigate supernatural goings-on at a creepy country estate. Once there he begins to witness some unexplainable occurrences and for those of you looking for a twist in the end of your stories - this one has a doozey. Not to give too much away, but nothing is quite as it seems and this one gives they yet-to-be-made ""Sixth Sense"" a run for its money in more ways than one.
Adapted from the James Herbert novel this movie is probably one of my all-time favorite haunted house tales and joining Quinn and Beckinsale are the likes of Anthony Andrews, Anna Massey and John Gielgud (in what is essentially an extended cameo). It's a brilliant gothic tale with plenty to recommend about it. I saw it with my roomies, who are all horror-movie aficionado's and they all agreed it was a good show.

788184,4,6304054106,"Certainly not a world beater but Haunted is a somewhat haunting movie that you may enjoy. In some respects it's an older and distant cousin of the Nicole Kidman movie The Others, a little less confusing but with an equally bizarre twist.

The skeptical Parapsychology Professor David Ash (Aidan Quinn) has written a bestseller which refutes the supernatural and spirit world and teaches such a course in an unnamed British university(perhaps Oxford). He also spends some of his free time exposing charlatans, debunking their paranormal activities. (seances, fortune telling, etc.)

David is intrigued when among his daily fan mail he receives a note from an elderly lady, not too far away, imploring him to come to Edbrook and eliminate the ghosts that are haunting her.

Of course David knows there are no ghosts but he feels he may be able to help her understand and therefore overcome her delusions.

The story begins in 1905, where tragedy strikes when young David is playing with his twin sister Juliet suddenly falls in a pond and drowns.

The story continues twenty-three years later when David now a professor at Oxford University accepts an invitation to country manor for the purpose of helping a terrified old woman who is being haunted by ghosts only she can see.

Once arriving at Mariell Manor David meets and is captivated by the free spirited, child like, beauty, Christine. Next he meets the object of his travel, the somewhat catatonic, Nanny Tess (Anna Massey), who may or not be Christina's aunt.

Eventually we meet Christina's childlike brothers, Robert (Anthony Andrews) who seeming has nothing to do except paint canvases of his lovely sister in the nude and Simon (Alex Lowe) who fancies himself as a jokester.

Yes this is indeed a peculiar family and just how aberrant becomes evident to David as he watches Cristina undress and jump into a small lake, followed by Simon, also nude.

Later strange occurrences begin, some of which could be explained as pranks but others like being caught in a fire only find out he imagined it, has our cynical professor confused and bewildered, unable to reconcile these bizarre events. David is also conflicted as his feelings for coy, ever flirting, Christina escalate and apparently she for him but brother Robert is obviously envious of the attention she bestows on David.

As a romance heats up between David and Christina, however, David appears to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the household. Even the apparently unwholesome relationship Christina appears to have with her brothers, especially Robert, initially fails to distract David. Too late, he realizes the nature of the evil within this isolated, rural manor house. In the end, it takes the force of something beyond the grave to save him from an almost unimaginable horror.

CONCLUSION

No, Haunted is no world beater of a movie. It's relatively small budget and has an even smaller cast with only five primary actors, (John Gielgud has more of a cameo part) and only a few others, namely young David and Juliet and later David's secretary. However I was pleasantly surprised by the movie as one of the more intriguing, well done ghost stories I've ever viewed. As in almost all so called horror movies there are lose ends or questionable directions, which did which did occur to some extent in Haunted but not nearly as much as similar contemporary movies.

The acting is superlative. This is an extraordinary tale of ghosts and otherside but it is subtle. It doesn't hit you over the head with unbelievable concepts and cheesy special effects. (except for a little at the end) This is a well done, stealthily told, haunted house story that is sure to hold viewers interest throughout. Kate Beckinsale give a wonderful performance as the seemingly quirky, provocative and free spirited Christina. Anthony Andrews is excellent as the slightly sinister, oldest sibling, Robert. Alex Lowe is appropriately eccentric as Christina's off the wall brother, Simon. John Gielgud gives a terrific cameo performance. Aidan Quinn is effective as the erstwhile debunker who loses sight of his mission and is mislead into a false sense of reality.

As I mentioned, Quinn and Beckinsale both perform splendidly (she can ask me out anytime she wants to), but so too does the entire cast. The reason I did not rate Haunted five stars is because of the application cheesy effects near the end. Shame on the director for devising or allowing it but it did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the film.

So, though Haunted may not be a world beater in general it may be one in its genre. Haunted succeeds as an entertaining and atmospheric English ghost story, full of mystery and terror and suspense, and a powerful surprise ending. I think it is one of the best haunted house movies I've seen but I'll let you be the judge.",1097625600,11,4853,4.908424908424909

This movie impressed me so much I made the mistake of reading the James Herbert books the movie is based on (""haunted"" and ""the ghosts of Sleath""). The movie is far superior and hardly recognizable to the original novels. And believe me, that is a GOOD thing! (I reviewed both novels so no sense in beating a dead horse here.)

788186,5,6304054106,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was an interesting ghost story with a few unforseen twists. Quinn plays a professor who likes to debunk supernatural phenomena as all just 'smoke and mirrors'. He's asked to come visit a stately manor house and check out three siblings'old housekeeper-nanny's complaint that the house is haunted. At first it looks like the nanny's imagining things, but after a day or two, Quinn begins to wonder if maybe the old woman isn't on to something evil. He begins to doubt his own thoughts regarding the supernatural. And worse- if there are evil ghosts at the old house, what do they want with him? There is some subtle clever dialogue in this movie that slipped right by some Imaginative Cinema Society friends of mine-and who were delighted when I pointed them out. See if you can catch them, too!

788263,3,6304054106,"""Haunted"" as a film has some very good points going for it - but it also has some very bad points as well.  Over all the good points outweigh the bad points but one or two of the bad points are really, really glaring.  The film is enjoyable and very worth watching but unless you're a big fan of the genre I don't think it's worth adding to your collection.
First the good points, the cast really is good - all the actors are top rate even if the script is a bit weak at times.  The cinematography is also among the good points and the music does a wonderful job at conveying a mood.  The not so good points are the slow development of the plotline - there were a few scenes that did nothing to move the plot forward at all they were just sort of there, almost like they needed to make the film a very specific length (which being a Hallmark film for television is understandable but they could have done little more editing for the DVD).  Another point not in the movies favor was the blatant inconsistency in the behavior of the lead character which I found to be incredibly distracting.
The film opens with a young boy losing his twin sister in a tragic accident.  Many years later, the boy (played as an adult by Aidan Quinn) has become a psychologist who spends his time disproving psychic phenomena.  Invited to a grand estate near his childhood home to investigate an older woman's problems with ghosts.  Once as the estate he is drawn in to the lives of the three siblings that live there.  He is even more drawn to the sister (played by Kate Beckensale) and begins a romance with her.  Slowly he begins to question things going on and even his own sanity as things begin to happen.  Can he solve the mystery before time runs out for everyone?
SPOILER WARNING:  As I said my major problem with the film is the inconsistent behavior by Aidan Quinn's character - he pursues his love interest with the sister, Christina (Kate Beckensale), even after he sees increasing evidence of an intimate relationship between her and one of her brothers.  This just seemed just completely out of character to me.  It's because of this that I only give the film three stars.",1036454400,,2166,4.436868686868687
788264,4,6304054106,"This is a little heralded gem of a film and a chilling adaptation of James Herbert's spooky novel of the same name. With a star studded cast, the film does not lack for talent. Beautifully acted, this gothic ghost story is a wonderfully atmospheric, haunted house tale, sparely told.
The film begins with a turn of the century scene in Sussex, England with two children playing in the idyllic English countryside. They are fraternal twins, David and Juliet Ash. While playing, Juliet ends up drowning, and David, to his life long regret, is unable to save her.
Years later, David (Aidan Quinn) is a Professor of Psychology with a penchant for debunking so-called supernatural occurrences. After receiving an intriguing and pleading letter from a Mrs. Webb about ghostly apparitions at the rural manor home in which she resides, David goes there, only to be met by the Mariell clan, consisting of Christina (Kate Beckindsale), and her brothers, Robert (Anthony Andrews) and Simon (Alex Lowe). It turns out that Mrs. Webb is their old nanny, whom they all still call Nanny Tess (Ann Massey). She is clearly terrified of something that is going on in the house, and the Mariells all seem to be humoring her.
The Mariell siblings, at first, appear to be wildly eccentric Brits, but later seem to be more than just a little twisted, as it soon becomes apparent that all is not right in that household. There are things that go bump in the night, strange music is played, and the ghostly apparition of a young girl seems to glide about the house and grounds. Moreover, Nanny Tess always appears to be in a state of acute terror and is even so when the seemingly benign Dr. Doyle (John Geilgud) appears to give her a check up.
As a romance heats up between  David and Christina, however, David appears to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the household. Even the apparently unwholesome relationship Christina appears to have with her brothers, especially Robert, initially fails to nonplus David. Too late, he realizes the nature of the evil within this isolated, rural manor house. In the end, it takes the force of something beyond the grave to save him from an almost unimaginable horror.
The acting is superb in this remarkably told tale of ghosts and things that go bump in the night.

I won't go into the plot, since anyone reading these reviews will have already been introduced to the characters and the actors who play them.  Aidan Quinn is one of my very favorite actors, and as far as I'm concerned, the chemistry between all of the actors couldn't have been more perfect.  I would probably have given this film FIVE stars, BUT, one thing that totally disappointed me about the film was, that, during the love scene between Kate Beckinsale and Aidan Quinn, the scene 'switches' to a full body shot of the lovers, and suddenly, when the scene (shot) angle is changed, the man Ms. Beckinsale is making love with is NOT Aidan Quinn!  The lovers flop over, the shot angle changes and WA LA!  She's 'doin' Mr. Quinn again.  I mean, I understand about stand ins, but the director screwed up this scene, showing the stand-in's face quite extensively in the shot.  How he could think he could get away with that and expecting that no one would notice, I don't understand.  The character change had nothing to do with the plot or characters in the movie, trust me.  The director just screwed up with the stand-in.  And, in the beginning of the movie, when Aidan Quinn's character exposes a charlatan medium, he pulls her accompice out of a 'closet' of sorts, exclaiming ""THIS is my mother!"".  Say, what?

788320,2,6304054106,"Add Lewis Gilbert's overlooked (and with good reason) ""Haunted"" to the steadily growing list of clich-riddled horror movies that form the nadir of Hollywood's throw-away movies. Featuring a beautiful yet strangely meek set design, a particularly well-known cast, eerily familiar scoring, and a plot that is little more than a recycle bin of overused twists, and you come up with a movie that tries to cover up its inept storytelling with fashionable excess.
The movie begins promising enough, when David Ash (Aidan Quinn), an English college professor, receives a letter from one Ms. Webb (Anna Massey), known as Nanny Tess to the children who live in the house she believes to be haunted by evil spirits. Ash, who lost his twin sister at a young age, has typically built an emotional block against all things supernatural as a way of not dealing with his guilt. His capacity for scrutiny forces him back to his hometown of Sussex to quell Nanny Tess's fears about the ghosts she claims are haunting her home.
But, of course, he soon is party to strange occurrences once within the house: there are scratching noises on his door in the night, voices can be heard throughout the house without a body to claim them, and other sorts of delusional phenomena that he passes off as mere child's play. Of course, the so-called children are adults: there's jokester Simon (Alex Lowe), who delights in playing pranks, tight-lipped, serious Robert (Anthony Andrews), who finds it his place to rule over his sister, Christina (Kate Beckinsdale), who instantly takes a liking to David.
After some more of the usual bump-in-the-night trickery and games of the mind, the story begins to fall into even more familiar territory, losing what little suspense it had going for it and settling for a plot that grows ludicrous and bombastically bad. A tepid love interest with Christina leads to tension between he and Robert, who also seems to have a more-than-brotherly relationship with his sister; talk about family dysfunction. And of course, David will see his long-gone sister romping around the house and the grounds, leading him to each piece of the puzzle surrounding the apparitions of the house.
These and many other routine plot twists and storylines abound without hesitation through the film's entire. I enjoyed the beginning of the relationship between David and Christina, played nicely by Quinn and Beckinsdale, who share a warm chemistry. But the script is a waste of their talent, keeping Quinn's character in a glassy-eyed haze much of the time, while Beckinsdale provides various T&A shots that are distasteful and unappealing despite her attractiveness.
The mere fact that this movie had some good potential, as evident in its well-developed beginning, also furthered my fatigue throughout the final act; perhaps I expected too much. And why not? If a movie such as this can afford the talents of Beckinsdale and Quinn and waste them both, it could at least make an effort to look like a first-class movie. Here, the sets are nice to look at, but lack the opulence needed to truly dazzle an audience, such as that of Robert Wise's ""The Haunting."" The musical score is reflective of dozens of scores from similar films, playing like something out of an ""Unsolved Mysteries"" rerun, which prevents it from evoking any believable tone or energy.
Director Lewis Gilbert seems to have made an attempt to create a movie that is marginally pleasing, but ""Haunted"" is little more than a waste of time better spent looking for a better movie. His ""surprise"" ending may not be easily spotted until its arrival, but the satisfaction it provides (or lack thereof) is something entirely different. This is a very unremarkable horror film, one that attempts to put a spin of elegance on a standard, run-of-the-mill plot that can't seem to find a suitable hiding spot these days.",1008460800,6,3865,4.984520123839009

I was a bit disappointed by the film, and it occurred to me that Haunted is more of an anti-horror film.  It's almost as if the creators of Haunted took the stereotypical horror flick and did the reverse with Haunted.  Instead of the characters being a bit cheesy and fun, the characters in Haunted were dulled and lacked intensity.  There was no blood or gore, and the only real scare/startle attempts in the film were the few instances of someone/something popping up in front of your face yelling ""Boo!""  Instead of having that one gratuitous skin shot, there were quite a few skin shots (about the only enjoyment I got out of this film - but not what I was looking for in a horror flick =).  In fact, if it weren't for all of the skin shots, I don't think there is anything else in this film that would have kept it from being rated `G'.
Also unlike many other horror flicks, this one has a plot that is easy to follow, but then again, the whole mystery behind the plot was easy to figure out (which I did about a quarter of the way through the movie).
Overall, I can't give this any more than three stars.  The acting was good but the characters were dull, the plot was good but very basic and easy to figure out, what little special effects there were had little effect, and the film lacked any sort of thrills, chills or electricity.

788324,5,6304054106,"This film is a ghost story of a very special type. The hero is an American professor just arrived in Cambridge, England. He does not believe in ghosts. He is summoned by someone and enters into a country mansion where three brothers and sister live with their old Nanny. She is the one calling for him and he does not find anything wrong with the house at first. Then little by little he discovers that things are slightly wrong. He lost his twin sister at the age of six. She drowned. He is thus plunged into a totally fake environment where everything is a pure lie, a pure unreal reality that looks, sounds, tastes, feels normal. And the descent into hell starts. He ignores the signs that something is wrong and decides to stay because it suddenly begins sounding strange. The descent would have no end if it were not for his drowned sister. So he will finally escape, but in what mental state ! Still convinced that ghosts do not exist ? Maybe not, maybe yes, though we know they exist. Ghosts are created by some guilt that is burried deep in our subconscious and unconscious and that guilt will never go away. Ghosts are just the reenacting of the events that produced that guilt. And he learns that from ghosts. So are they the figment of our guilt or are they real ? No answer emerges from this film that is made in such a tactful and delicate way that we really doubt of everything at the end of the story. Even the walls of our houses seem unreal and ghostlike. Thats English talent at its acme : to make us doubt of our strongest truths and beliefs. England is a misty country and mist as well as fog blur the picture of the real world, make reality fuzzy.

788381,5,6304054106,"This movie IS scary. And it IS NOT becouse of scary faces (it's NOT like in the EXORSIST) and NOT becouse of blood, gore and violense (It's Not like CHILD'S PLAY). No, this movie isn't really violent, what is scary about it is the WONDERFUL story of James Herbert's novel. The story is not only scary but it's iteresting and beautiful (so not only guys would like it but girls will too).
The movie has actors that played GREAT! This isn't the movie that will amaze you with it's makeup and super effects. This is a movie that will amaze you with a story much stronger than any other movie you will EVER see.
And the best part is the twist in the end that will make you not only like the movie but LOVE it!  Trust me, this isn't the movie you would want to see just once!",976147200,7,770,4.167785234899329
788382,5,6304054106,"With the pervasiveness of the slasher sub-genre in the horror marketplace over the last 15 years, it's been rather difficult for more discriminating horror fans to find horror films that disturb and frighten without resorting to decapitation and mutilation of all sorts of obnoxious teenagers. For all the genuine originality and post-modern irony of the original Scream (which - like Unforgiven - should have closed, not reinvigorated,its sub-genre) its novelty has long since worn out thanks partly to its cynical, bland sequels and other putrid imitations. Thankfully, the recent success of The Sixth Sense and - to a lesser extent - A Stir of Echoes and What Lies Beneath suggests there may be light at the end of the tunnel for those of us increasingly tired of endless, infantile and inferior rehashes of Halloween and Black Christmas. But for horror collectors who revere movies like The Uninvited, The Innocents, Rosemary's Baby, The Haunting (original), The Legend of Hell House, The Exorcist, Don't Look Now, The Changeling, Burnt Offerings and the like, the bulk of recent Hollywood horror output has not been kind to our collections. Well look no further horror buffs! Lewis Gilbert's superb Haunted is the unacknowledged classic you've been looking for. Deploying the staples of intelligent classical horror - a haunted mansion; a twisted family history; a sceptical investigator - Gilbert has fashioned a classic of the genre that is destined for cult status. Beautifully set in the rustic south of England following World War One, the story involves a Cambridge professor (Aidan Quinn) who is a renowned debunker of supernatural phenomena. Invited to Edbrook Estate to investigate an old woman's allegations of ""evil spirits"" haunting the mansion she tends, he encounters the eccentric but charming family occupying the mansion. As his relationship with the sister (Kate Beckinsale in excellent form) grows, dynamics are brought into play which gradually begin to reveal the true evil at the heart of the house and its history. To complicate matters, the young professor is haunted - first emotionally, then literally - by his dead sister, whose drowning at the age of seven he blames on himself. From its wrenching opening scene (recalling Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Know) through to its unsettling concluding revelation (only the sharpest of you will figure it out beforehand), Haunted grabs you and never lets go. Midnight scratches on doors; mysterious gypsey seances; empty chairs rocking vigorously; apparitions swirling across dark lawns; spectral fires springing from nowhere; and something horrid in the lake ... Haunted hits all the right buttons with an admirable lack of embarrassment or irony. This movie is out to scare you and every frame accords to that function. So for those of you unable to get your fix from Jan de Bont's abysmal remake of The Haunting, take my word for it - this is the movie you'd been expecting! This is a horror classic awaiting for your discovery.",970185600,90,3003,5.181069958847736
788383,5,6304054106,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE WAY THAT ENGLISH WRITERS ARE ABLE TO BLEND IN THE ASPECTS OF A GOOD OLD FASHIONED SUSPENSE TALE(THIS IS A GHOST STORY  THAT HAS ALOT OF ELEMENTS OF SUSPENSE TO IT) AND PUT IN A ROMANCE ANGLE.THE  WAY THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MANIPULATED BY THE FAMILY AND HOW HE ACTUALLY  BEGINS TO FINALLY BELIEVE THE STORIES THEY ARE TELLING HIM IS  WONDERFUL.THIS IS A VERY GOOD STORY ACTED OUT BY SOME VERY TALENTED ENGLISH  ACTORS.IT IS A VERY SENSUAL MOVIE WITH A ENDING THAT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE.I  REALLY ENJOYED ALL THE PLOT TWISTS AND AM THINKING OF PURCHASING THIS IN  THE DVD VERSION.,967161600,2,602,4.467889908256881

The plot is complex, the  characterization and acting are superb, and best of all it generates within  the viewer genuine goosebumps, which is rare in this age of movies which  use special effects to thrill the viewer, instead of old-fashioned quality  movie making.  I hope to see more movies like this one in the future!",966729600,12,435,4.375

However, I felt it was too boring in places and sometimes the F/X were not as convincing as they should have been. It's  a shame this film is underated, it could have been a lot better and I'm  sure that the novel would be scarier.",951868800,,332,4.171875

788388,5,6304054106,"This movie is first of all a great haunted house story.  If you don't think you like haunted house stories try this one.  It's different and clever and eerie.  It's also beautifully filmed and acted.  Aidan Quinn  does a fine job as David Ash, the skeptical investigator of things that go  bump in the night who is still troubled by the death of his twin sister  years before.  Kate Beckinsale steals the show as Christina Mariel the  ""audaciously charming"" girl whose home Ash comes to investigate.  Their love story is well done.  (When will Kate Beckinsale get the kind of  notice she deserves?  The lady continues to do superb work in every kind of  role.) When you pop this into your VCR (please relaese this on DVD soon!)  you're in for a real treat.  You won't be safe from goosebumps until the  final credits. . . and maybe not even then!
