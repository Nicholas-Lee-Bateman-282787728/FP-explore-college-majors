2018215,2,B0001NBMY4,"The Charactors and story have potential but rent it first. If you can't watch it, it doesn't count for much. The discs don't play on all machines, some problem in the coding. Bandai knows of the trouble with the discs but hasn't said anything about it or if they'll be doing anything about it. So be warned.",1090454400,4,307,4.4035087719298245
2018216,4,B0001NBMY4,"With the success of the original .hack releases behind them, Bandai went on to make a short series out the .hack mange, which have also only just appeared in translation.  Set four years after the first crisis it is the story of two new players, Shugo and Rena, who are introduced to The World as part of a promotion where they win the right to use the characters of the original dot hackers - Kite and Black Rose.
The same events that heralded the first crisis are beginning to reappear.  Balmung, who has become a system operator, is concerned that Twilight is returning.  When Aura appears to give the new 'Kite' his data drain bracelet and dangerous creatures begin to appear in beginner's dungeons we know that once again The World needs saving.  Shugo and Rena bring a lighter and more human touch to the story though which seems to make it all the better.
The differences from the manga series are subtle, but significant.  In the TV series, the twins have been separated in their parents divorce, and the relationship between them is a primary focus for the story.  The World is the only place they can meet.  Several of the internal relationships are rearranged as well.  Shugo is a bit more inept as a fighter, some episodic details are left out, and new characters are introduced to smooth the way.  But the over all story is the same.
It's difficult to compare manga and TV series, since the media are so different in what they can allow.  The TV Series flows much better than the manga, and the characters come across as a bit older (in behavior) than they do in the comic.  All of the changes are favorable, and I found myself enjoying the lighthearted touch of the TV series much more than I expected to.  Artwork is better than the first TV series and the viewer gets a genuine feel for what life is like in the artificial reality called the world.  Well worth watching for any .hack fan.
Be warned though that I experienced the same technical problem on one of my DVD players that a previous reviewer did - with the disk loading the trailers/previews repeatedly.  These disappeared when I used my computer's player though.  This is a serious issue from a purchase point of view, and you should insist on a trial period when buying.",1087689600,17,2248,4.557213930348259
2018217,3,B0001NBMY4,"mediocre rating, not b/c the show was bad.  i have enjoyed the .hack series.  but i was expecting more out of the dvd version.  the english voices are poor (typical) i favor the Jap w/subtitles.  there aren't any decent preview trailers for other shows.  and it didn't have storyline or concept art feature that i enjoyed on the .hack/sign discs.",1087171200,,346,4.7
2018218,5,B0001NBMY4,This is another .hack show and god does it do better than the original! Yes it does take place in the World but sheesh has it changed for the better! The main characters Shugo and Rena win a limited edition contest which gives them the special costumes of the legendary .hackers Kite and Blackrose. They go on adventures and actually interact with other characters that are not part of the main party Shugo and Rena usually interact with. ALso no Subaru thankfully...hehe she was happily replaced by a much better character named Lord Balmung oh yeah and he actually has a personality. well other than that this series rocks and is one of the better series I have seen this year. go out and buy it! make sure you buy the box with it its really worth it. Also one more thing I have no idea what that one guy is talking about his disc for 'cause mine works perfectly fine maybe he's just psycho.,1085961600,4,893,4.418181818181818
2018219,5,B0001NBMY4,this is the best .hack series ever i have seen it all it has more action but less of a story the chracters are great and it has to be on your list of animes to watch if youve played the game and if you are a big fan of the game ^_^,1081468800,2,231,3.3773584905660377
2018220,5,B0001NBMY4,"Legend of the Twilight is much different from Sign. First Twilight takes place after the game series. Its not as long and not as serious as the Sign serious, but just as good as Signs. Think of Twilight as a funny haha version of Signs, you will see the usual characters from Signs plus a few new ones. Though its a completely new series there are a few bits very familiar to the Sign series. Personnaly i feel its just as worth it to have as the Sign series. Best of all about the Twilight's storyline is that since its set apart from the game series, even if you havnt played the game, you won't be lost.",1078963200,4,606,4.188034188034188
2018221,3,B0001NBMY4,"After the games resolve much of the mystery and dilemma in THE WORLD, you have to assume that KITE and BLACKROSE were booted from the game for some reason, because their characters are revived and raffled off to hopefuls.  The hopefuls who recieve the characters are a brother and sister team of Rena and Shugo who live apart due to schooling in Japan/Tokyo.  They soon play in the WORLD and use it as a place to be together while living apart.  However, Kite gets drawn back into problems left unresolved in the game and is given the data drain bracelet again.  Through a series of light hearted adventures in a kawaii anime style, they meet some of the adventurers from the video games, and reveal some of the minor mysteries left unanswered from previous .hack installments.  One of the funnest episodes in the first DVD is where the same girl from SIGN who dumped an ill Grunty of Tsukasa does the same to one of the TWILIGHT characters, but is revealed at the end to be scamming people so she didn't have to care for her pet...and the girls deal with her off screen.  This kind of resonance helps make TWILIGHT seem like more then a minor appendix to .hack.
While it is a very cute and fun little series, involving more animation and action then SIGN, TWILIGHT doesn't have the kind of deep, emotional story of its predecessors.  TWILIGHT is a 12 episode series with a beginning, middle and end, and in some ways mirrors the video games.  Within the episodes, you will see Balmung, Sanjuro and Mistral but none of the SIGN characters.  It's cute!  It is fun.  It isn't great.  While some light hearted sexual interest is encountered, the oddest element is a kind of incest implied again and again between the brother and sister as Kite gets nervously arroused over Black Rose's design.  The animation is a little soggy, but it doesn't kill the idea of the series - cuteness.",1078790400,9,1879,4.589820359281437
8015036,5,B0001NBMY4,"Love it , its funny , great animation and very cute . If your a gamer than the Hack series will hold some interest to you if not for the gamer aspect of the series . This was some of my first anime I got into , that would lead to my love for anime , so its a great series and light hearted . Its nothing like the Hack Sign series if not its the complete opposite of it . Great series.",1383868800,,384,3.63855421686747
8015037,2,B0001NBMY4,"Before beginning this latest installment of the .hack franchise, I rewatched .hack//SIGN, the prequel to all the TV series and the PlayStation II games.  Comparisons between the two are impossible to avoid, since it seems as if Bandai took to heart the criticisms of those who really disliked the original, making this the exact opposite in every way possible.  Where SIGN was a 26-episode series criticized by many for its slowness of plot development, LOTT's 12 episodes breeze along at a fast clip.  The overall gloomy weirdness of the first is replaced by chibi cuteness galore, with overall character designs modified for most, including the Gruntys.  There is an unexplained mix of these almost chibi characters with only slightly simplified original designs like Balmung, one of the few who returns from previous versions of The World.  Although the seasoned viewer will easily recognize many locations within The World ( like Mac Anu and some of the playing fields ), they nevertheless look fresher, more colorful, and less threatening; and therefore less interesting.

The characters themselves behave differently, with very little time for - or interest in - the introspection that was the focus of the original.  The protagonists Shugo and Rena, twin siblings in real life, seem like typical bubbly anime teens, neither silent nor brooding like Tsukasa, Mimiru, or Subaru often were. Shugo's clumsiness, ""sister complex"", and overall libido are indistinguishable from most teen boys populating anime.  But of course things are not as they appear on the surface, and there are the usual expected threats to the stability of The World.  The ""real"" world outside the games is also depicted more here than in SIGN; but there somehow seems less division between the two.  I have seen this praised for its inclusion of more players moving through the game; but the convenient ability for all the main characters to be so easily available at the same times for parties, etc. is not believable given their differences in ages and stations.

In short, it's as if Bandai has taken the original concept as presented in SIGN, shortened and simplified it to please its detractors; and thereby removed all the uniqueness and mystery that made the original such a feast for all the senses.  Not the least casualty of all this is Yuki Kajiura's wonderful score, here replaced by an easily forgotten bubblegum confection.  It's not that LOTT is SO bad - it just suffers irreparably by the inevetable comparison with the original.  It's safe to say that if you loved SIGN as I did, you will probably be disappointed at the least by this; and conversely if you hated it for the reasons stated, you will probably like this undistinguished piece of fluff.",1233619200,,2745,5.0176211453744495

8015039,4,B0001NBMY4,"It is a safer, kinder place.  Yeah, right.  Shugo and his twin sister, Rena, are new to the game and have won two legendary characters, Kite and Black Rose.  They meet and make many friends but also run into dangerous monsters.  High level monsters that seem to be appearing in low level areas.

Is it a bug or is something more happening behind the scenes?  The two characters they have won are not your run of the mill characters.  And as the ununsual events continue to happen more and more people are starting to notice.

Maybe it IS just a bug in the program?  Right.",1125619200,,572,4.371428571428571
8015040,1,B0001NBMY4,"This was a very...very...very... uh... well... interesting DVD. Let's see... how can I say this uhh... IT SUCKED. I'm the type of person who usually loves everything I watch, I love almost every genre and its easy for me to like things. Especially anime. If I say an anime is bad...its pretty dang bad. This anime is about 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins for the online game, .HACK. They won the skins of 2 legendary characters who beat the game. Even though the sister is excited (her skin is Black Rose, yea, you know who I mean .HACK video-gamers), the brother (he has Kite's skin) well... isn't excited. It's just a pretty lame show that insults the amazing video games and the OTHER .HACK anime which is a masterpiece. If you really--and I mean REALLY--want to check out this series, I reccomend the manga; it's MUCH better.",1123113600,,834,4.604026845637584
8015041,4,B0001NBMY4,"This is the first .hack// series I've watched and so far I really enjoy it. The character designs are adorable, and the animation is pleasantly bright and colorful without ever looking garish or overdone. The upbeat opening and soothing closing music go well with the general feel of this series. Each episode has a good amount of action and comedy mixed in to keep the viewer entertained. I found the story fairly easy to follow even without prior .hack// knowledge. Overall a very cute, pleasant, and easy to follow series. I found it to be a nice break from more intellectually heavy and dark anime series.",1114992000,4,609,4.754716981132075
8015042,5,B0001NBMY4,"This story is so well done, and the climatic ending is philosophically profound as always, leaving you with a ""whoa"". What I really love about these .hack anime is that they incoporate so much philosophy into it, giving you a complete experience. Of course, this is the type of excellent work I expect from the makers of ""Evangelion"".

The characters from the series are so loveable too!  From Shugo's goofy , tooth-missing smile to Reina's ""Oni-chan"" to what's-her-name's rare item obsession, its great.  Anyhoo, watch the anime in its orginal language with the English subtitle, you'll get a much better experience.  Japanese voice actors are superb, unlike some dubbing artists ;)

Enjoy! And this series rock!",1094169600,4,713,5.112068965517241
