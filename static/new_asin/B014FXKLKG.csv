7391318,3,B014FXKLKG,"The three stars are for the price. Other than that, if you have the set that was released in 2008, don't get this one.  Its the same thing. The cover and art work on the discs are different, however, the menu is the exact same as the 2008 edition.  Buyer Beware before purchasing if you already have the 2008 set. This is pretty much a duplicate.",1456012800,13,346,4.2272727272727275

7391343,5,B014FXKLKG,"I watched this series on TV when I was young, but I hadn't seen all the episodes. I loved it then and I love it now. Get to see a lot of great actors at a younger time in their careers, and they look like they have so much fun with their characters. One of my favorites is Christopher Reeves. Such an underrated actor. Another interesting piece was The Nightengale with Mick Jagger and Barbara Hershey. The only downside is the audio is a bit low, so I had to turn it up quite a bit. Overall, love this collection.",1502928000,2,514,4.15

7391357,4,B014FXKLKG,"While I can say this product is not the best on the market, I will say for the price it is a good choice. Please note the pros and cons bellow, but know that I was purchasing this to replace VHS copies I had since I was a child. While I did want a certain amount of quality I wasn't going to spend the quadruple price of the high end copies.

Pros: 1) Price, 2) Fairly nice packaging and disk, 3) Complete series as noted, 4) Unlike a number of other reviewers I can say all my disk played without error, 5) the package fits where only one of the VHS once stood and on VHS it was one episode to a tap so... SPACE SAVER!

Cons: 1) While the packaging is lovely it isn't heavy duty and mine came with a few of the spindles broken so the disk fell loose.
2) While the disk are nicely made the claims it made of being ""digitally remaster and restored"" are a little... boastful. I was purchasing this to replace a set that was on VHS and while I can say they were better on the disk than on VHS, they weren't so far above and beyond in quality. This set really could have been created from VHS originals(this and number 3 are the reasons I deducted a star)
3) No closed captioning. My hearing isn't what it once was and some of the speech is difficult to make out so it would have been nice to have had closed captioning but since I suspect this came from VHS copies unsurprising as to it lacking.",1491696000,16,1392,4.076642335766423

7391368,5,B014FXKLKG,Great box set! Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend who grew up watching the series in the 80s.

7391386,5,B014FXKLKG,"I was so happy to find this series on Amazon. I loved it in the eighties', and I still love it today. There are some great performances in this series, including Jeff Goldblum as a henpecked ""big bad wolf"", and Robin Williams, who played a frog so convincingly, he really almost became one! This series is safe for most children, although Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood might be too intense for very young ones. There is very mild profanity in one or two episodes ( Sleeping Beauty was one ), so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to that. All in all, this is a wonderful show that brought fairy tales back into our lives. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.",1469059200,4,680,4.404761904761905
