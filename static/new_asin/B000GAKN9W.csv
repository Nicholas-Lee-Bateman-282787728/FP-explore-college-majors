By a large, they are the best and most fun assemblies the kids could attend. I've been a ""Christy"" follower for many years. No one teaches dance better than her or makes it more fun. She is high energy!!Every year I have choreographed the faculty dance for the school variety show at our local elementary. Where do I go for inspiration? Christy's videos. I love ""Funky Freestyle"" as I can simplify the steps for the teachers, yet still look hip and up to date.",1243555200,3,584,4.625
