8249743,5,B0013B34YE,"Most of us who watch architectural documentaries are used to video house tours using constant panning and, usually, a soundtrack of chamber music or narration by a talking head.  This documentary features a stationary camera, with what are basically color slides lingering for a moment on whatever the filmmaker found interesting or evocative -- much the same way in which I actually study architectural details when I'm looking at a house.  The ambient noise is wonderful; makes you feel what it's like to live in that house in that neighborhood. In most cases, the interiors are included. For most of us, seeing these iconic houses in person is not possible. I rented this DVD, watched it about 10 times, and plan to purchase it soon. Not recommended for those who are not overwhelmingly visual, or who need spoon-feeding by a narrator.",1302480000,5,838,4.9361702127659575
8249744,1,B0013B34YE,"As previously remarked ""do not buy this. it is a sham. a high school kid could do better with a mid range video camera"".This DVD is waste of time and money. It displays no understanding of Architecture or how to convey Architectural imagery and meaning to the viewer. Some of the buildings appeared to be filmed without the permission or knowledge of the owners and over their neighbors back fence with the background sound of birds and cars. A lot of the images of Schindlers projects could be seen by anyone from the street begging the question, Why this DVD was made?  Issues such as light, shade and the quality of  the spaces get lost in poor images which are composed at odd, strange angles and lack the perspective composition to explain the space thus depriving the viewer of any idea of what these buildings are like.
I wonder if this DVD was really produced to promote Schindlers Biuldings",1293926400,,899,4.647798742138365
8249745,5,B0013B34YE,"I saw this film at a museum screening in San Francisco, with the filmmaker in person.  This is clearly not a typical documentary, with talking-head interviews and narration to drive things along.  It is just footage of the buildings, a series of static images for each house (shot on 35mm film, and recorded in dolby sound, I might add).  A unique approach, and there is something beautiful about this film.  If you love the work of R.M. Schindler, you have to watch ""Schindler's Houses"".  Since it is such an unusual film, preview it on You Tube first (you'll find a couple of scenes there).",1289260800,2,592,4.653846153846154
8249746,5,B0013B34YE,"I'm writing thing because of the first review.  I saw this film at the UCLA Hammer Museum when Heinz Emigholz was in town for a visit.  I quite enjoyed it.  However, the way its made needs a bit of explanation--its certainly not a typical documentary with narration and such, if you're wanting that, then look elsewhere.  A perennial challenge with making films about architecture is capturing on film what its like to be in the space.  This is what Emigholz is trying to do.  He wants to give you a  sense of encountering the building with a kind of experiential bareness.  And so the film is a series of ""captures"" of being in the presence of the building and allowing you to experience it for yourself.  Its best viewed on a large screen.  The key here is what these images bring up in you.",1225324800,8,793,4.444444444444445
8249747,1,B0013B34YE,"do not buy this.  it is a sham.  a high school kid could do better with a mid range video camera.  this is not a documentary. no naration. no story - at least on the main video.  i could not bring myself to watch the bonus features.  the only good news is since there is no narration, you can speed through this horrible waste of time.

it consists of still (tripod) shots with a video cam, with background sound like birds and cars etc, of schindlers projects with access that any one could see from the street.

i am going to return it if amazon will take it.

i am amazed that amazon would put such a bad DVD up for sale.",1209081600,4,624,4.057377049180328
