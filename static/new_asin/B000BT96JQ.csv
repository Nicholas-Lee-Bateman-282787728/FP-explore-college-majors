The film begins with a picture of a ship, the titles are shown. ""Classified and Passed by the National Board of Review"". Next we see night and fog, a man walks along the street. Joseph Beck enters a law office, he has worked in the jungle for oil companies. Now he has come into an inheritance. A shade is raised and lowered as if for a signal. But Beck survives the attack, and hurries to ship out on a tramp steamer. A showgirl also leaves on the ship. The bartender Dawson suggests another travel route. [Does he know something?] Beck carries a revolver in his suitcase; is he in danger? The Captain wants to marry Nita Paxton and tells Beck to stay away. Will he? Beck has a near accident; he learns of the plot against him. Where did Dawson go? Beck plans to leave the ship when they arrive at the next port; but he won't leave Nita.

Beck finds there is an imposter aboard. He learns the truth about Dawson and Nita! Bergstrom didn't find the papers. Will the ship hit the rocks? Can Nita save Joe? Yes, the ship hits the rocks but doesn't sink. Bergstrom talks a lot. A seaplane passes overhead, then lands to rescue the people. Anybody can pick up an envelope from General Delivery. Will Bergstrom and Mike force Nita to give up the letter she doesn't have? Will Joe rescue Nita from harm for a happy ending?

This interesting film would be better with a better script and budget. Joe was like a secret agent who has to escape dangerous enemies to accomplish his mission safely. This reminds me of a novel by Eric Ambler (""Journey into Fear""), and is similar in parts to ""The Maltese Falcon"". Other films would have a similar plot (""Borderline"").",1267401600,2,1684,4.478827361563518
