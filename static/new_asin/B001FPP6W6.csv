8302267,5,B001FPP6W6,"One of the most gifted dobro artists to come along in our lifetime, Rob Ickes effortlessly blends the rich tradition of bluegrass with contemporary sensibility.

In this video, you'll get a close up look and listen to one of the most recorded acoustic instrumental musicians on the planet. Comprised entirely of music he's recorded on his solo outings, this time it's just Rob and one other musician in a casual setting. No studio magic, EQ's, Reverbs, etc. Just incredible raw music.

Whether you love dobro as a casual listener, or because you're a dedicated musician - you'll come away delighted.

And.... there's a bonus! Not just the DVD, but a CD of the same performance is included in this package. Well worth the money.",1237939200,3,727,4.846774193548387
