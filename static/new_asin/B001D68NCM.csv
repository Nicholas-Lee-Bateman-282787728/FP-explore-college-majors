8291876,4,B001D68NCM,"Outstanding journey through the historical lineage of the blues.  Many references throughout to the tie-ins and influences on Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, but one disappointment in my eyes is that John Paul Jones and John Bonham are scarcely mentioned if at all.  To me, they are just as key ingredients in the ""Zep formula"" if not THE key ingredients which took much of what their influences did and differentiated it and elevated it to something that could stand on its own independent of its forefathers.",1409788800,,507,4.883720930232558
8291877,5,B001D68NCM,"This is for everyone who wants to understand the roots of the blues, and the origins of blues based rock. To see Son House's style on film.......the holy grail of the matter. As a player from the sixties,having spent time with John Renbourne, and grew up playing ""Angie"" by Davie Graham, nostalgically a little icing on the cake.",1358640000,2,329,4.689655172413793
8291878,4,B001D68NCM,"Forget the title and cover - if you are a fan of the Blues you will love this DVD. Bringing together the insights of musicians and historians (with Delta State Professor Dr. Luther Brown, most notably) we have a chance to follow the Blues lineage up to Led Zeppelin. The first 48min. are devoted to founders of American Blues, starting with Charlie Patton. Tremendous insight and commentary from knowledgeable authors and scholars; all interspersed with great music. Then we move to Sun Studios with emphasis on Elvis. After that there are snapshots of Jimmy Page and his occult interests but this comes across as mostly filler as it reflects some of his musical style for a short period. The true inspiration is found in the musician's that caught the attention of Plant and Page in their teens.

In part this is somewhat ironic as we Blues fans still feel the sting of the poor recognition offered to Howlin' Wolf, Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson, Bukka White and others that Zeppelin freely borrowed from. None the less the truth of this DVD provides some atonement.

You won't be disappointed - pick up a copy",1240790400,9,1112,4.786458333333333
8291879,5,B001D68NCM,"This dvd gives us insight into the Bluesmen who helped shape the sounds of Led Zeppelin. Charley Patton is examined in great detail, and we actually get to see Dockery Plantation, just as we get to see Stovall Plantation and the muddy water which gave the great Muddy Waters his name. Robert Johnson is examined in a manner which, while giving him credit for being a great musician and wonderful lyricist, does not over-emphasize his greatness at the expense of House or Patton. The second half of the dvd is quite different, as we get to learn about Skiffle, a watered-down British attempt at American Blues and Folk songs. Despite the music's lack of emotion and authenticity, it was interesting to learn about how huge the Skiffle scene was in England at the time, and how men like Page were influenced by it. The three acoustic European guitar players who influenced Page are shown, and we are able to see how one of these men's fascination with Arabian and Indian music influenced Jimmy. Though it is sometimes unclear exactly how a particular artist influenced Led Zeppelin's Plant or Page, at other times, the connections are made quite clear. Considering the price of this dvd and the excellent production value, I highly recommend this documentary to any Blues and/or Led Zeppelin fan. Ironically, a dvd dedicated to Led Zeppelin is full of more information on Blues than the seven-part ""The Blues"" series from a few years ago.",1234310400,4,1436,4.841463414634147
