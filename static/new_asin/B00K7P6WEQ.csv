8656625,3,B00K7P6WEQ,"This boxed set is magnificent in every respect save one: there are no subtitles. If there were, this would be a five-star review. All the comprehensive bonus materials are fabulous, and if the filmmakers care enough to make them part of the package, they should care enough to provide subtitles. Although the recording of voices is, with rare exception, extremely fine and clear, some essential words of dialogue cannot be understood except by lip readers; but if the camera is pointed at someone other than the speaker, even lip readers cant get them. Sometimes, if two actors are speaking at the same time, you cant tell what either of them is saying. Other times, a slammed door or a pot dropped in the sink will obliterate an important word or phrase. Crying babies often can obliterate something of significance that youd really like to hear--as can the occasional loud music

At the time I write this review, this boxed set is no longer available through Amazon. Who knows if or when it may return. But other sets are available, and they won't be subtitled either.

Thirtysomething was a brilliant series when it first appeared. And it holds up very well indeed. It was the first TV series that really explored human character in all its subtleties and complexity. It will make you laugh and cry and, more than anything else, think. It presents human nature in the round, in all its glittering, bright and dark facets. Its a series you shouldnt miss.",1511740800,2,1456,4.773809523809524
