THE ARRIVAL is a nightmarish sci-fier about an astronomer who first tunes into alien broadcasts and later discovers these shape-shifters have already come to Earth and are actively adapting our eco-system to their liking. The plan is to poison our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, thus raising the planet's mean temperature by about 25F.

Ron Silver is outstanding as an ET who's infiltrated JPL, the hi-tech company that Sheen works for, by morphing into and then replacing the boss Sheen reports to. When Charlie brings taped evidence of otherworldly broadcasts to Silver, he's fired from his job and the tape is destroyed. Sheen's partner in the radio location project (Richard Schiff) is murdered, but it's arranged to look like a suicide. This event and his job termination don't deter Sheen from working independently to tune into and capture on tape the transmissions he'd previously picked up.

When a signal originating from Mexico crosses in with the outer space one, Charlie travels there to locate the source. This is how he meets Lindsay Crouse, a climatologist investigating massive levels of greenhouse emissions. Their opportunity to work together ends when Crouse is murdered. Worse, Sheen is made to look like her killer after he trespasses at the supposed power plant, one of several that's ""terraforming"" Earth into a hothouse, and learns the full extent of the creepy-looking aliens' invasion and plans.

Confronting Silver with what he's learned just makes Charlie a target for elimination. The story's exciting climax occurs at a satellite dish broadcasting base, where Sheen and his girlfriend, Teri Polo, battle for both their lives and the survival of all humankind.

This great start to what could've been a phenomenal movie series was unfortunately kiboshed by an extremely mediocre sequel.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
