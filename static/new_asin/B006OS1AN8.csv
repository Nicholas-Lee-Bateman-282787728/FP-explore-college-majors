Evil Roy Slade makes this a fun little release, but, oh, attaching Brothers O'Toole to it makes you want to find a way to get through the protective Blu coating to scrape off that latter film.

Evil Roy Slade:
ERS was a 1972 TV-movie featuring John Astin as the most wonderfully nasty Westerrn bad guy.  It's a funny 90 minutes, with an abundance of excellent supporting talent, including Mickey Rooney, Henry Gibson, and Dick Shawn...and the lovely Pamela Austin. who can make any man's heart beat faster.  Basically, the story sets Slade as an orphaned baby in the Old West who even Indians and wolves refused to take in.  He grows up not loving anything except his six guns.  Until he falls in love with the prim and proper Pamela Austin, that is.  At her urguing, he tries to give up his outlaw ways and go straight.  John Astin (The Addams Family) had a field day with this role.  Video is quite good (ranging from 3.5 to 4.0), but, considering its 1970s TV roots, will never be compared to any recent movies, please bear that in mind.  Sound is clear.  There are no extras.  Movie: 3.5.  Video 3.5. Audio: 3.5. Extras: 0.  Overall: 3.5

And then we get to the second film on this disc...

Brothers O'Toole:
Now I must disclose I have not been able to sit through any more than the first 15 minutes of this film, but I could not take any more of it than that.  Maybe I am wrong in being so negative about Brothers O'Toole, because I have come across a few reviews of the film by fans who rate it highly.  I wanted to enjoy it, honestly, but after 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 15, I felt the remaining time in my life is much too valuable to use any of it watching it.  The video for B.O. is abysmal, looking like a cheaply-made film that has come nowhere near being restored for DVD, let alone Blu-ray.  Think bad VHS.  Movie: 1.  Video rating: 1.  Audio: 3.  Extras: 0.  Overall: 1.5",1339977600,3,1961,4.336088154269972

8502171,1,B006OS1AN8,"My one star rating has nothing to do with the movie itself; I have seen it multiple times before and would rate it five stars. It is an excellent movie with lots of laughs.
I'm giving this purchase a one star rating but would like to give it no stars because the Blu-ray disk will not load in my Blu-ray player. This is the second disk I received from this seller that would not load. The first was a gift of the same movie. I did not know how to return a gift, so I ordered another. Rats! Same result! I intend to return the one I ordered and will never order another from this seller.",1474070400,,586,4.060344827586207

8502173,2,B006OS1AN8,"I saw Evil Roy as a teenager and remembered it as being absolutely hilarious. It came up in an office conversation, so I decided to order a copy and share the happy memory with my wife. So, you may ask if its still just as funny, now that I'm in my 50's. The answer: not so much. We almost turned it off before finishing, but managed to watch it all the way to its disappointing end.",1447718400,,383,4.052631578947368
