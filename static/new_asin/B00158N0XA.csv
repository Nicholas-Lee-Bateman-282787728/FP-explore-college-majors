8257827,3,B00158N0XA,"Another story of the ""forgotten ones"" in Spain, by none other than Eloy de la Iglesia! In ""Colegas"" (""Friends"" from 1982, AKA ""Pals""), best friends and pals---'Antonio' (Antonio Flores) and 'Jos&eacute;' (Jos&eacute; Luis Manzano), live in a housing project just outside Madrid. They're both eighteen years of age---directionless and are desperate for work. Things get even more desperate and complicated, when 'Jos&eacute;' knocks-up 'Rosario' (Rosario Flores), who happens to be his girlfriend and his best pal 'Antonio's' sister. Confused? Don't be, this is typical ""Eloy de la Iglesia"" territory.

I'll explain why I think the film was good but far from excellent. First of all, both 'Antonio' and 'Jos&eacute;' came from working-class families and, the family unit was still intact even though they were financially strapped (in the scenes at home, the family always had their meals together. So, its not like their parents were on drugs or negligent of their children. If anything they were like any struggling working-class family anywhere in the world). The dialogue between the trio was somewhat realistic and not forced (they were pretty good for non-professionals), but the scenes involving their respective families were wrought with melodrama. The filmmaker's own ""peccadillos"" seemed to be on display by the very theme and nature of some of the scenes. Which I think were unnecessary and distracting, and actually lends itself to something much worse than ""exploitation"". They were way too suggestive (I won't go into any of it here, but for those of you whom are familiar with the work of Eloy de la Iglesia, have an idea of what I'm referring to). My other grief, the post-dubbing/synchronization is awful, especially when it doesn't involve ""the trio"" for some reason.  Anyway, the story itself was solid when it came to the ""trio of friends"", but veered off-course otherwise. It's still a good effort by Spain's first and foremost filmmaker from the era of ""el destape"". And, believe me I respect his boldness and honesty tremendously, which is one of the reasons of why I admire his overall work.

Here's an interesting tidbit about the young people that took part in the film. Antonio and Rosario are real-life brother and sister. Their mother is none other than the iconic flamenco singer/dancer and movie-star---Lola Flores. Both young actors---Jos&eacute; and Antonio were hooked on ""smack"" (just like Eloy de la Iglesia), and died prematurely from an overdose, along with another young cast member who was known as ""el Pirri"". So, that does make the preceding here somewhat realistic and tragic at the same time. Rosario Flores went on to become a fine actor and, had a very successful singing career too.

The quality of the DVD (by Divisa Home Video from 2015) is truly fantastic, an excellent job. The film has been completely restored. I first saw this film on VHS (from Facets), and it was transferred from a faded and worn print, so believe me I know! The other big miss---no English subtitles (how are they ever going to market this to the English speaking world, I don't get it!). Spanish (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 94 mins. Due to the adult nature of the story, recommended for mature audiences only. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.es for 7.36 euros.)

8257829,5,B00158N0XA,i personally thought that there would be more nudity do not get me wrong there is a good amount.  i personally do not like the fact that the lady was thinking about abortion but i like the idea that she did not get it done.  none of the movie is in English.  a great movie though.,1343174400,,280,3.9642857142857144
8257830,5,B00158N0XA,"I must admit that I love European movies a great deal because most of them rely on story and acting rather than special effects.  This was a devastating story of young people facing some extremely difficult situations.  They brought them on themselves by wrong decisions, but they live in an environment that certainly makes the punishment for their actions even worse.  I loved the movie, and have watched it several times.",1321574400,2,424,4.943661971830986

8257832,5,B00158N0XA,"This movie is a candid study of contemporary teen friendships set in Spain. Antonio and Jose have been the best friends for most of their eighteen years. They've drifted into a jobless lifestyle of the young-in-waiting for a future.
*When Antonio's sister discovers that she's pregnant by Jose, a chain of events is set in motion. While she's trying to decide over her options of keeping the child, abortion, or adoption sale, the friends engage in street hustling and drug running to raise money to pay for her decision.
*This is all balanced against the friend's relationship with their respective families; mostly with Jose's brothers open sexuality and his parent's disapproval of his friends. The ending has a good and a tragic outcome for both friends.
*I highly recommend purchasing this movie because of its believable and sympathetic characters, which we can draw parallels to in our American culture.",1210204800,12,910,5.114093959731544
