1845309,3,B00008G8YL,"I usually always see anything that stars the slightly trashy-for-some-reason-always-sexy Rosanna Arquette. It's a fetish and I'm getting help for it. And Don Cheadle has methodically established himself as a bankable Hollywood talent. I also love the earnestness of independent films. Although not many people have seen this film, it showcases a performance from Don Cheadle that could've served as an aggregate preview of his future work. I must admit though, I'm not quite yet a Gabriel Mann fan. I think he sometimes comes off as a skinny, spaced-out younger version of James Spader. For those of you who don't appreciate independent films, you may not enjoy this movie, because it does take a while to come together. But with a little patience this film delivers. This film also shows a bit of courage, as it delves into some of the rarely talked about fallout only rape victims can identify with; namely, the subsequent preferring or needing of abusive situations for sexual satisfaction and the revolving door of guilt that scenario consequently opens. Although Things Behind the Sun is predictable in spots, the strength and depth with which the characters are explored makes this film an underrated winner.",1179619200,4,1214,5.136363636363637
1845310,4,B00008G8YL,"Things Behind the Sun (Allison Anders, 2001)

When you make a movie like this-- a deeply personal autobiographical flick whose main characters are played by relative unknowns, but whom you've surrounded with top-flight actors who are consistently underrated by Hollywood-- you're bound to make either a film that will eventually be called one of the greatest ever made or a piece of utter crap. There's really no middle ground-- or at least, there wasn't before. Along comes Allison Anders and changes all that. Things Behind the Sun is not the kind of deathless filmmaking we've all been aware, in the back of our heads, she's capable of since we all saw Four Rooms. But it's certainly not bad, not bad at all. It's a little manipulative, kind of cheesy in spots, but if you're aware that this is autobiography, you can't not watch this movie and keep thinking to yourself ""this could have been so much worse than it is.""

Sherry McGrale (Deadwood beauty Kim Dickens) is an up-and-coming singer-songwriter in Florida with a past so ugly she's repressed it, but everyone around her knows something very bad happened; she shows up drunk on the lawn of the same house three years running. Chuck (Don Cheadle), her manager, tries to get her through and best she can and keep her from derailing her career. An intern at a music magazine in LA gets ahold of one of the group's demos shortly after and plays it for her boyfriend Owen (Dominion's Gabriel Mann, doing his best James Spader impersonation), a writer at the magazine, who is stunned by it, and campaigns stridently for the magazine to go interview the young singer. Owen, of course, has a catch-- he, and his older brother Dan (Killing Zoe's Eric Stoltz), are directly involved in the traumatic events in Sherry's past.

It's the kind of coincidence that simply doesn't fly in fiction, which is likely the main reason that the movie's publicity (and the DVD's jacket copy) goes to such lengths to impress upon potential viewers that, yes, it really did happen this way. And once you swallow the mother of all coincidences, Things Behind the Sun becomes an intriguing movie about memory, guilt, and forgiveness, brave enough to ask the questions and never provide satisfactory answers for them. Despite her closeness to the material, Anders takes almost a hands-off approach to directing-- put the actors in front of the camera and let them do their thing. You need a strong stable of actors for that, and Anders has them. Just to back things up, her minor characters read like a who's-who of the best B-list talent Hollywood has to offer-- Elizabeth Pena, CCH Pounder, Patsy Kensit, Rosanna Arquette, Alison Folland, and a number of others. (It helps to have your main character's backing band made up of members of Redd Kross and Dinosaur Jr., as well.)

Anders has put together quite a good little film here, one that has been unjustly overlooked. Do yourself a favor and rediscover it. *** ",1165968000,3,2949,4.820158102766799
1845311,5,B00008G8YL,"This is an absolutely wonderful film that I had never heard of before chancing upon it at a public library. Someone there should get a raise. There are two excellent reviews here by eurotrashgirl and jhclues, and I have only a few things to add.
If you are close to someone whose life has been degraded by childhood cruelty, you must see this film. If you merely love superbly realistic storytelling and wonderful acting, see it as well. In addition to the performances mentioned by the other reviewers, the lovely and gracious Elizabeth Pena has a brief but crucial role as the young mother who now lives at the house where Sherry was raped those many years ago. Her character sets a beautiful example of overcoming disdain and disgust to sense someone else's pain and reach out in compassion. Very moving and inspiring.
Be warned that this is definitely not for the immature or squeamish. There are several torrid sex scenes that push the boundaries of an R rating. They all serve the needs of the story in one way or another, but most are at least disturbing and two rapes of young girls are both terrifying and heartrending. Think hard before letting your kids see this.
All in all, a film I would like to add to my collection and see again (but not more often than I can stand something this intense).",1073952000,23,1306,4.585470085470085

The main character is struggling with PTSD after a rape she experienced in her adolescence and she is in 'self distruct mode'. You gotta have the stomach to watch this but when you decide to, do watch it because it's a gem. This film should be celebrated for shedding light on self distruct mode.  That someone struggling through it isn't easily capable of living in peace, but instead are punishing themselves and trying to still survive something they went through at the same time. The script is excellent and very we'll written. I will tell all of my friends to watch this film and buy myself a used copy.

Will the truths set us free ... or will we be left to die in their darkness? It's only in the telling of it that we may even perhaps know.
This movie seems to me to be relatively ""low budget"" which lends itself to some beautifully and simply shot scenes. Very well acted ... a lot of nuisance in expressions from all actors. Paced and pieced together in a compelling way. Never overly maudlin, exploitative of emotions. It asks for your genuine consideration of the story, and gives every reason to be worthy of it.

1845422,4,B00008G8YL,"I have to say that, had I seen this movie at age 10, 11, 12,  I could probably have avoided a lot of pain in my life.  So many girls grow up without any ""street smarts"". While that is basically a good thing, girls need to understand what some boys and men are capable of doing.  In the movie, the young girls always sensed something ""off"" in conversation with the guys, but they did not understand the urgent need to flee.  Once coerced into the apartment, they were mercilessly attacked sexually, their innocence taken, and their life forever altered.  Girls need to be taught to trust their gut instincts and don't let fear of embarrassment or ridicule keep them for one second in a dangerous situation.",1391558400,2,705,4.563492063492063

1845425,5,B00008G8YL,"This is an interesting exploration of a complex event across a time span that is usually much more narrow. Structurally, the focus on several main characters, as well as a nice mix of supporting and transient characters, further show how the core event of the film has an impact on people who were there, who knew, who were bystanders drawn in, who are employed to deal with the repercussions to society as a whole. As an attorney and a psychologist, this interconnectedness makes this exploration of the effects of a crime a welcome addition to the film world.

As a music fan, this movie hurts, hurts so bad because the soundtrack is so good. Less than a quarter of the way into the movie, I was on the internet searching for the soundtrack to buy...but it doesn't exist. And musicians contribute songs under alternative names, or write them for other performers...from the 1960s dark and moody pop to the experimental rock bands who revved up in the 80s, and back to the original songs that loop back to 60s as interpreted by the SubPop-type bands who grew up on them...you want it, and you cannot have it.

In a way, it fits the film. In an artistic sense, most definitely not in an ""I can't buy a soundtrack is as bad as gang rape"" sense.",1384646400,,1243,4.52
1845464,5,B00008G8YL,"Despite some dated production values, this is fine film, a story well told by passionate and earnest actors.  One senses real humanity caught in the grip of a terrible and immoral trauma, a gang rape of a 12 year old girl.  The film nicely bridges between the childhood events and the consequences for adulthood of all the players, victim and perpetrators.  I recommend it highly.",1378598400,,380,4.815384615384615
1845465,4,B00008G8YL,"The director deals with a difficult issue using thoughtfulness and craft.

1845468,3,B00008G8YL,"This was a deep movie and it touched on some real raw material. I like that they did the 3 way scene. Some thought it was buzzard but I thought it was brave and brought to light a well kept secret about some psychological effects of rape.

I gave it only 3 stars because sometimes the acting was just so emotional and the things they said at those moments were so cliche and trite it came off corny.  Right when you think you are really feeling the movie it becomes sometimes so corny its laughable which is too bad because the suject matter is serious.

The movie doesn't let you figure anything out on your own it's too overdone.",1360281600,,631,4.285714285714286

1845473,2,B00008G8YL,"The best way to kill a technically well made film is through a bad screenplay. Exhibit 1A: filmmaker Allison Anders' 2003 Showtime film Things Behind The Sun. Ostensibly based upon Anders' real life `trauma' of being raped as a child, the film wallows in every manner of clich on the subject of victimhood imaginable, as well as wasting some fine performances, save that of the ever PC and increasingly hyperbolic Don Cheadle, whose performance here presages his terrible role in last year's Oscar-winning Crash.
  Yet, for all the potential this film has- and which a better and/or more objective director may have well exploited, it bogs down in the sort of Feminist PC clichs that made Monster such a bad film. The men are either unrepentant beasts- like Dan and his rapist pals, or wimpy excuses for men- like Owen and Chuck, straight out of the Alice Walker school of misandry. The film even ends with a trite dedication to Anders' long dead grandmother, described as a rape `survivor,' not `victim.'
  Yet, despite this seeming sensitivity, instead of showing how the vast majority of rape victims actually do adjust, mature, and cope with their violation, then move on, Anders indulges the Hollywood clich of the eternal victim who cannot move on. This is, however, in keeping with the film's immature schizophrenic attitudes toward sex and psychology. As example, it also has too many pointless T&A scenes of sex, yet no male genitalia. Yes, we know Owen is impotent, so why do we need to see him try banging two different women, and failing? That such gratuitous, and sexist, sex is in this film is startling since the rest of the film is so PC. And, as a whole, the film is far too long at two full hours, and could lose much of its first forty minutes by just getting Owen back to Florida, and cutting the scenes of him shooting blanks. Yet, if that were not enough, there is the bizarre threesome scene with Sherry and two of her groupies, climaxing to furious rock music- an obvious steal from the famous drug scene of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, to the music of The Doors' The End. Even worse, though, is the whole device of the flashbacks tells too much of the story, and lessens the impact of Owens' telegraphed guilt, as well the impact of the film.
  Things Behind The Sun is, ultimately, an example of the old good intentions lead to....trope, and fails as a work of art, despite glimmers of breaking through its self-imposed political strictures. In that way it recapitulates its main characters' failures to move beyond themselves. If only such a trope had been ameliorative.

She is drawn to this same house year after year, but she doesn't know why. ""Things Behind the Sun,"" the title of which is taken from a Nick Drake song, is a heart-breaking story of the long-term effects of rape on a woman and one of her (unwilling) perpetrators. Sherry was gang-raped at age 12 by her friend Owen's older brother and friends. Owen was a victim himself, forced by his violent brother to participate in the rape. Many years later, Owen is a successful music journalist and Sherry is gaining notoriety as a singer-songwriter, but both continue to struggle with the effects of the rape. Owen is impotent, while Sherry is a alcoholic who must re-enact her rape with random sexual partners in order to feel alive, Under the guise of writing a music article, Owen embarks on a quest to reacquaint himself with Sherry, so they can both bear witness to their painful past. His desire is to save Sherry, but he also realizes that to truly heal, he must save, and forgive, himself. The entire cast is fantastic, but Kim Dickens and Gabriel Mann anchor the film with their brave and heartfelt performances. Alison Anders has long been one of my favorite filmmakers, and this is by far her most raw and personal film. It is also her most important film. No movie I have seen more realistically captures the long-term effects of sexual assault on not just the victim but on everyone around her/him. It also reminds us that there is hope for people to recover from the trauma of rape. With courage and support, people can take back the power from their perpetrators. ""Things Behind the Sun"" is a beautiful, powerful film, and it should be mandated viewing by all.",1441065600,3,1778,4.629746835443038
