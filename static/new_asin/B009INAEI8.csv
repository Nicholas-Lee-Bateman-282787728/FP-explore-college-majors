I just have always seen him in a certain way, a certain kind of purity that comes along with his films. It's good to see him spread his wings though and try something a little different.  In the end, if your a fan then get this set and enjoy. Jacking Chan power all the way!  :)",1517616000,,405,4.05
8541849,5,B009INAEI8,"As a huge Jackie Chan fan myself, I do not consider ""Crime Story"" and ""The Protector"" to be his greatest films, or even in my top 10 list of greatest action movies of all time. However, I can safely say that that the former is far greater than the latter. It will become obvious for which movie he had grater creative control.

""Crime Story"" is a very suspenseful thriller with few fight scenes. But the action is very intense and there is not a dull moment! The story is a blend of ""cat and mouse"" and ""race against time"" as Eddie Chan (Jackie Chan) must find and rescue the kidnapped businessman Wong Yat-Fei. Unbeknownst to Eddie Chan, Wong Yat-Fei has been kidnapped by his own partner in the force!

This blu-ray release of ""Crime Story"" is the best I've seen yet. It has a very sharp and natural image. The picture has been remastered and the audio is as good as you'll get. The audio is a solid DTS 5.1 HD Master and is the original Cantonese soundtrack, with an option 5.1 English dub or the original 2.0 Cantonese mono track. The special features for this movie are the deleted scenes and an interview with director Kurt Wong. Both are presented in SD, but anamorphic, and have English subtitles.

Now, for ""The Protector""

This was Jackie Chan's 2nd attempt to break into the Western/International film market, after the failure of ""Battle Creek Brawl"", and was directed by James Glickenhaus. According to Chan's autobiography, he became dissatisfied with the movie immediately during its production, and unsuccessfully tried to get Glickenhaus replaced. And when you watch this movie, it's not hard to see why he didn't like it. His character is a ""Dirty Harry"" type of cop, always serious, ""talking tough but carrying a big stick"" so to speak. This is the only movie where you'll hear JC say the F-word. The action sequences in this movie are also paced much slower than the style of JC's Hong Kong films. Also present is gratuitous female nudity, something that also upset Jackie Chan.

However, present on this blu-ray is the Asian/Hong Kong version of the film, also known as Jackie Chan's personal edit. Many Jackie Chan fans consider his personal edit to be the superior version of the film. When Chan gained the Asian distribution rights to the film, he did the following

1. Removed all nudity scenes. The naked female workers in the drug factory have been replaced with workers wearing outfits appropriate for a lab.

2. Filmed an entire sub plot involving the massage parlor coin, featuring actors who were in the original US version but didn't have a big part, and actors who didn't appear in the US version, such as Sally Yeh. This subplot adds more depth to the film, and provides us with 3 additional action sequences, one of which features ANOTHER fight scene featuring henchman Benny Garucci (Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace).

3. Cut out the pointless ""fortune teller"" scene, and other scenes were trimmed to help speed up the movie's pacing.

4. Dubbed the entire movie in Cantonese. This was done mainly to replace the cursing and American slang. However, in some scenes the Cantonese dub is completely different from the original spoken dialog in order to match the story as told in the Hong Kong version.

5. Completely re-edited the final one-on-one fight between himself and Bill Wallace. Unlike in the US version, this version's final fight is much more fast-paced, less predictable, and features Chan's style of a fight scene!

However, the downside of Shout Factory's release of JC's edit is that they clearly did not care about giving it an adequate presentation. Unlike other releases, the JC edit is anamorphic, but it's not HD (unlike the US version on this disc). They did not take any time to clean up any film grain and scratches, nor did they try to make any color correction. If you're familiar with the now out-of-print Universe Laser DVD, well, let's just the say that the picture quality here for JC's edit is even worse on this blu-ray release, with the only benefit here being that Shout Factory's blu-ray version is anamorphic.

To compare both versions, the US version has
1. Superior picture quality (HD)
2. The original undubbed English soundtrack (DTS-HD 5.1 Master), complete with all the American slang cursing
3. A lot of female nudity

The Hong Kong version has
1. Inferior picture quality (anamorphic SD, film grain & scratches, no color correction)
2. The subplot that gives which provides more depth and action sequences
3. No nudity
4. The dubbed 2.0 Cantonese mono track with English subtitles
5. A superior re-edited fight scene between Jackie Chan & Bill Wallace

It's all going to come down to your own personal preference. If you're a true Jackie Chan, I recommend buying this for your collection!

Also for ""The Protector"", we have an interview with director James Glickenhaus who gives ""his side of the story"" for why he made the film the way he did, and a Cantonese-dubbed behind the scenes featurette (with no subtitles).",1503878400,,4987,4.8163742690058475

8541856,4,B009INAEI8,"It has been so difficult to find good copies of older Jackie Chan films that I welcome any blu-ray versions at all.  That being said, this blu-ray is definitely better than any other version of these films, including the original Hong Kong DVDs, which I have--just don't expect miracles, because film preservation has never been a priority in Hong Kong, and the makers of the blu-ray, while they did adequate ""clean-up,"" are not exactly the Criterion Collection (but then, it's not as pricey as CC releases, either).  My only wish is that they had not squeezed what is essentially three films onto one disc, although blu-ray technology has enough ""room"" in its info code to do that.  The disc contains ""Crime Story"" with a choice of soundtracks (including English dubbed for wimps) and subtitles, the original American release of ""The Protector,"" and, in its bonus features, Jackie Chan's Hong Kong version of that film, which is the only thing that makes even having this film on the disc worthwhile.

""Crime Story"" is a fairly straight forward police drama based on the problem of ransom kidnappings that were prevalent in neighboring Macau and Taiwan at the time.  It is a more serious story than the usual Chan romp, probably because the film was not created for him, so it doesn't feel so much like a Jackie movie, per se.  It still has lots of his trademark action, however, and also highlights his serious acting skills, which tend to be ignored.  Being able to watch this film in Cantonese on blu-ray is worth the price alone in my view.

""The Protector"" is the result of one of Golden Harvest's early attempts to introduce Chan to the American market (the others being his parts in the ""Cannonball Run"" films which they produced, and the minor but sweet ""Big Brawl""), and the original American release is not only an utter failure, but rather a nasty piece of work.  With Danny Aiello spewing the F word non-stop, ridiculously offensive nudity and even racist attitudes abounding, it is hard to watch even for Jackie's work, and deserved to die its commercial death.  It must have always been the plan to have a different version of the film for release in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia, as the nudity and violence typical of '70s Hollywood flicks would earn a Category III (adult X rating) in HK, Taiwan, etc., but I believe it was Chan's disappointment in the film as directed by hack James Glickenhouse, and his status at GH that made it a matter of essentially recutting and re-filming it into an entirely different film, and one that is much superior.

The Hong Kong version has not been available in any US release until now, so unless you have a copy of the HK DVD, this is probably your first chance to see the film.  Chan's version is infinitely superior, although he was stuck with enough of the Glickenhouse footage to keep it from being more than a fun watch, not up to the usual Jackie offering.  Obviously, Danny Aiello is dubbed into Cantonese, without the cursing, which is a big plus, and the nudity is replaced with alternate scenes, which is also a blessing, because the bare breast shots were not only ugly, but nonsense: the female drug lab workers are naked ostensibly to keep them from hiding drugs on their bodies, but they are cutting open casaba melons (ha ha, melons and melons) and stuffing them with packets of heroin--are they supposed to tape them closed afterwards, and Customs won't notice?  Instead, Chan has substituted workers in lab coats injecting drugs into the melons, which makes a hell of a lot more sense.  Chan also added scenes with popular HK singer/actress Sally Yeh that allowed for his trademark shenanigans of comedy-laced action.  If you've only ever seen the American original, this version will be a revelation to you; if you've never seen this film at all, do yourself a favor and skip right to this version (found in the bonus section), and never, never, ever watch the other one.",1364256000,8,3948,4.733236151603498
8541857,4,B009INAEI8,"""Crime Story / The Protector"" combines two of Jackie Chan's more unusual projects into one package.  Jackie did not have total control over both these projects, and it shows.  Normally, Jackie had control over the script, the directing (often doing it himself) and all the action.  In ""Crime Story"", the story and direction were in place before he became involved.  It is still a pretty good picture, with more gun play than normal for JC, but hard hitting and with one of the most memorial villains, as well as a bit more sex.  I'd give it a very healthy 4.5 stars alone.
""The Protector"", on the other hand, is trash.  It has way too many needlessly naked women, and Danny Aiello is plain offensive in his attitude towards Asians.  JC did the movie without complaints, then took his option to re-edit the picture for the Hong Kong market, re-shooting many of the scenes and extending the action, as well as getting rid of the nudity.
Which gets me to the bonus features, which are outstanding, especially for ""The Protector"" there is a short interview with the director, where he gets to state his side of the case.  More importantly, the JC version of the movie is also included, and it plays like an entirely different feature - and it is the better version, if not in picture qulaity.
For the money, there is a great deal of value in this package.",1361145600,3,1351,4.576763485477178
