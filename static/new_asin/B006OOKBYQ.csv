8502111,5,B006OOKBYQ,"Frederic and Veronica Patenaude did not waste any time to ""play around"" on this DVD they packed as many recipies as they could in 3hrs. Veronica did most of the ""cooking"" and she was very amazing. I just can't wait for her to come out with many more including the book for the DVD. The recipies all look delicious but I have only tried a few and so far they are good. I love the sauces which make my salads very delicious. Like they say you can adjust the amount or kinds of ingredients to your taste.

My husband and I watched the DVDs on a rainy day when we were just relaxing at home, and after preparing a few of the recipies for him, he is now 80% raw from being a vegan for over 38 years. The presentation was very good and the couple make a great team. Some of the recipies are Veronica's personal recipies, and that makes them different from many of the recipies on the DVDs I have watched and books I have read on raw vegan ""cooking"".

I have enjoyed this 2 DVDs package and I hope you will too. I really like how The DVDs were focused on cooking than straying off to some other form of entertainment, because this makes it jam packed with cooking ideas.

Thank you both for making these DVDs. I love simple raw cooking but on the weekend I life to treat myself to some tasty treats for breakfast lunch and dinner, since during the week it's mostly fruits and veggies.

I must say in one of the recipies where Veronica prepared a kale salad she softens the kale by cutting it it small pieces then washed it in water while bruising it with her hands, but that's not what I do to soften the kale. I usually cut it in small pieces after washing it, then bruse it in a wide pan with lemon juice and some natural spices. However, hers was ready to serve and I usually let mine sit for a while to absorb the ingredients before eating. I will try to do it her way as well.

I highly recommend this DVD set because it changed my husband's life and my taste buds are happy.",1338595200,10,1973,4.167979002624672
