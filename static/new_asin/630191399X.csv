380018,4,630191399X,"One of the first (if not THE first) major Hollywood films to be shot in and around the ruins of Europe after WW2, Jacques Tourneur's BERLIN EXPRESS (1948) is a fun ride for fans of film noir, with great starring roles for Robert Ryan, Merle Oberon and Paul Lukas.

When a carrier pigeon is shot down over Paris, it's cryptic message is discovered by a group of children and forwarded on to the authorities.  Soon after, a group of disparate government workers from the United States, England, Germany, Paris, and the Soviet Union all board a train headed for Amsterdam, where noted German peace activist Dr. Bernhardt (Paul Lukas) is to give a speech.  After narrowly avoiding an explosion in his sleeper, Bernhardt later disappears once the party arrives at the station in Amsterdam.  Bernhardt's secretary Lucienne (Merle Oberon) must appeal to the combined efforts of the traveling companions in his recovery.

An obvious attempt by producer Dore Schary to make a statement on the need for countries to band together after the tumult of WW2, BERLIN EXPRESS is a moody, noirish thriller, which makes good use of it's location filming (particulary the bombed buildings and underground cabarets of Amsterdam).  The script by Harold Medford (based on an original concept by Curt Siodmak) is well-rendered and the performances are fine.  Merle Oberon's shocking French accent aside, she's all you could possibly want as the heroine, and Robert Ryan matches her every step of the way.  Paul Lukas' performance as Bernhardt seems to dovetail his Academy Award-winning role in ""Watch on the Rhine"".

Four men who happen to be on the train, from four different countries (Britain, France, Russia, & the U.S.) all team together to rescue the activist. Truly great stuff.

380020,3,630191399X,"While still worth seeing, BERLIN EXPRESS should have been a better film than it turned out to be.  The plot involves the attempt to protect an anti-fascist German statesman (Paul Lukas) from members of a die-hard Nazi underground.  An attack made on the train ultimately leads to a manhunt through bombed out Frankfurt.

According to the DVD's cover, this was ""the first American movie filmed in post-World War II Germany"".  Director Jacques Tourneur and cinematographer Lucien Ballard take full advantage of this opportunity by producing some superb visuals of the city's remains.  In my opinion, they even do a better job than Roberto Rossellini did, in this regard, for ROME, OPEN CITY (1945); a film that obviously influenced BERLIN EXPRESS.

Unfortunately, the visuals and overall pacing are impaired by a convoluted script.  Specifically, an attempt is made to make BERLIN EXPRESS more than an espionage thriller.  It also tries to be a ""why can't we all just get along"" film.  With this in mind, the train passengers that later form the manhunt group were drawn from different nationalities; Robert Ryan is American, Merle Oberon is French; there is also a Britisher, a Russian, and a few Germans.

Despite the ensuing international relations socio-political dialogue, it is still a film worth seeing.  The scene of Robert Ryan being shot at in a large beer vat is quite affecting: it has stayed with me for decades.  And I'm not sure if I'll be able to get Merle Oberon's feathered hat out of my mind anytime soon.

The Warner Archive Collection print has not been restored in any way, and there are a number of visual artifacts, but this did not interfere with my enjoyment of the film.",1277251200,10,1695,4.905263157894737

380023,4,630191399X,"'Berlin Express' may not have much of a reputation, but it's one of Jacques Tourneur's best thrillers. Virtually none of it takes place on the Berlin Express, with the majority of the film shot on location in the awe-inspiring ruins of an almost totally destroyed post-war Frankfurt where Robert Ryan teams up with an Allies-in-microcosm group of companions including unflatteringly shot Frenchwoman Merle Oberon (sporting the film's worst accent by far) and Brit Robert Coote (who thankfully doesn't even attempt a Liverpool accent) to find Paul Lukas' kidnapped politician and save him from die-hard Nazi fanatics. Great moments abound, from the Paris opening where a carrier pigeon is shot, then nearly given a formal burial in the shadow of Montmatre's Sacre Couer by children before reaching maman's kitchen table to reveal a coded message, to Robert Ryan literally finding himself trapped in a barrel in bombed out brewery.

Great production line entertainment that demonstrates just how good studio product could be when you got the formula right, this is a trip well worth taking.

380026,2,630191399X,"This is an incredibly boring film, with lots of meaningless talk and talk. However, there are nice outdoor shots of Frankfurt in 1948, with all the post-war rubble all around. There were other films with scenes of Germany during this post-war period. One that comes to mind is Billy Wilder's ""A Foreign Affair""; which is more interesting than this bland film, even though it is not one of Wilder's best. Another great film of this type is ""The Third Man"", but that has scenes of Vienna, not Germany.",1020902400,2,499,4.681818181818182
380027,3,630191399X,"Berlin Express was the first post war American movie to be shot on location in defeated Germany and the evocative location shots of bombed out townscapes and the depiction of a nation so economically and spiritually depressed that cigarettes are its chief currency and the spirit of resentment towards its conquerors still burns brightly are the most striking aspects of the picture.
The plot revolves around the attempts of dissident Germans,unwilling to accept the reality of their crushing defeat in World War two ,to foil the plans of a prominent politician to press ahead with unification plans and greater co-operation with the occupying Allied powers
Out to stop them are some of his travelling companions on the eponymous train--his secretary(Merle Oberon) an American nutritionist,an English teacher ,a Soviet military man and an individual whose nationality remains elusive(Charles Corvin)
The tale takes them to low cabarets and abandoned warehouses ,coming to a climax back on ther train with one of their number turning out to be a traitor
Strong performances by Ryan as the nutritionist and Walter Slezak as the politician keep things rolling along and some atmospheric direction by the  under-rated Jacques Tourneur help sustain interest
The tension between the occupying powers and the mutual suspicion between the Soviets and the Western powers is put over succintly and well
The movie is over-relaint on voiceovers and has dated but still has interest. The Internet Movie Database puts this in its bottom 10 film noir list which is silly
Its neither that bad nor is it a film noir,but rather is  a neat thriller with an optimistic ending and a belief in progress and the possibility of peace between nations It might be naive but it isn't noir",1009929600,23,1761,5.132404181184669
380103,4,630191399X,"Saw half of this years ago on late night cable, glad to see it available, though the dvd-r I received froze.  Amazon did replace it and the second disk worked fine.  No fancy  packaging, extras, restoration - very basic.

The movie is an old-fashioned spy thriller, post-WW2 but before the Cold War politics settled in and defined spy and war movies for the next few decades.  As such, it is dated, but so are screwball comedies.  And, it seems,are a lot of Cold War movies.  that doesn't mean it can't be entertaining.  It isn't classic Tourneur, but there are great little scenes and touches, images that stay with you.  Shot in post-war Germany for the most part, the background ruin is sobering.

Robert Ryan add Merle Oberon give great performances.  The script is uneven, occasionally heavy on voiceovers, but then delivering nice little bits like using a clown for a plot device (evil or good, depending on who inhabits the costume).  the image of the clown making his way through ruins is quite startling.  Exchanges like the one between Oberon and Ryan in the train as he discovers she's taken over his sleeping cabin, and when Ryan breaks down the definitions of ""attractive"" and ""good-Looking"" by calling out ladies sitting at other tables in a dive, are nicely done.  And there's cleverness in having two representatives of the occupying forces settling who is going to ""occupy"" the lower bunk with a coin flip, as they head into Germany. And a set piece death struggle that takes place in an enormous beer vat is outstanding.

While not in the same league as The Third Man, or Out of the Past or Cat People, this is a movie that deserves to be appreciated by film fans whose taste can accept pre-MTV film making as a legitimate art form.  This is one of those movies I want to revisit every now and then.",1388188800,2,1817,4.63125

380107,5,630191399X,"One of the first American films photographed in postwar Europe including Paris, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin Germany. In divided Germany just after WWII, people from many different countries are passengers on a train. When one of the passengers, Dr. Bernhardt, a German working for peace (Paul Lukas), is kidnapped by former Nazis who don't want his ideas to work, the others must set aside their differences and work together to find him in time for an important conference. Robert Ryan portrays an American government agricultural envoy who becomes entangled in the intrigue, and beautiful Merle Oberan is the German Peace envoy's assistant.  Much of this took place before the Russian blockade of Berlin, and it's interesting to see a young Russian officer (Roman Toporow), a former English soldier (Robert Coote) and a Frenchman (Charles Korvin) grudgingly cooperating to find the kidnapped envoy. But not is all as it seems, and the surprise ending will keep you glued to your chair!  The photography is top-notch, showing the bomb-destroyed cities of Germany, and lots of great scenes of the steam-powered train that carried important military and civilian personel to Berlin in the post-war Occupation period.  It has all the flavor of an Orient Express mystery!  I highly recommend this film for the historical value of what geopolitical relations were like in Europe follwing the Second World War.",1366848000,2,1406,5.207964601769912
380108,4,630191399X,"Most of Hollywood's post-WW2 dramas filmed in Europe were directed by European expatriates, as was this 1948 RKO production. Director Jacques Tourneur started out in French cinema as a teenager, but spent most of his career in the American studio system. He was ideally suited to direct a film in post-war France and Germany.

 BERLIN EXPRESS transplants a fairly standard film-noir story to postwar Europe; a random collection of people working for the Allied Occupation are caught up in neo-Nazi attempts to kidnap or kill a German statesman(Paul Lukas)prior to a major postwar conference in Berlin. Robert Ryan plays an American agricultural expert; British actor Robert Coote's a schoolteacher; Merle Oberon plays Lukas' devoted French secretary; Charles Korvin plays a French businessman, and Roman Toporow plays the stoic Red Army Lt. Maxim.

 The location filming, in Berlin and Franfurt-am-Main, is staggering in its depiction of an utterly devastated country being brought back to life---it goes a long way toward selling a made-in-Hollywood script. Definitely a period-piece, but worth seeing and enjoying.",1364774400,3,1116,5.508771929824562

The film recreates Paris, the ashes of Frankfort and part of Berlin with sharp reflections on the various layers were present, as Soviet, British and American efforts to establish a minimum of order in this horrendous mess.

The delirious performances Merle Oberon and Robert Ryan, the feverish tension around the kidnapping and agile direction of Jacques Tourneur make this curious film (along with Notorious and Sabotage) an unmissable film.",1320278400,,866,5.260869565217392
380111,4,630191399X,"""Berlin Express"" is a 1948 black and white cold war drama (one of the very first) set in Berlin immediately after World War 2. The film is notable for some of the first film of post war Germany showing large sections of Berlin and Frankfurt which are devastated by the bombs. Variety called it ""extraordinary background of war-ravaged Germany.""

The film concerns a German professor (Paul Lucas) who travels to Berlin to present his plans to unite the allies (Russia, France, U.S. and U.K.) in their joint caretaking role, and the attempts of hard core Germans to prevent him from appearing.

Paul Lucas (1891-1971) plays the Professor. Lucas won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for his performance in ""Watch Over the Rhine"" (1943), a considerable feat considering  he was up against Bogart (""Casablanca"") and Gary Cooper (""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). He's probably best known as the Professor from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".

Merle Oberon (1911-79) plays his Secretary. She started in films in 1928 but it was her role as Anne Boleyn opposite Charles Laughton in ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) that brought her to stardom. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Dark Angel"" (1935) but is probably best remembered for her role as Cathy in ""Wuthering Heights"" (1938).

FWIW - Oberon was married to cinematographer Lucien Ballard at the time. To hide her facial scaring, Ballard invented a type of lighting, named ""Obie"" (after Oberon), that is used to this date to de-emphasize facial imperfections.

Robert Ryan (1909-1973) plays an American who tries to help the Professor. Ryan made nearly 100 films between 1940 and 1973. In his early years he often played a villain especially in film noir dramas (""Crossfire"", ""Act of Violence"") then transitioned into the tough guy with a good heart role (""On Dangerous Ground"").  My personal favorite Ryan role is Deke Thornton in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).

Director Jacques Tourneur (1904-77) is best known for his work on films with Val Lewton, like ""Cat People"" (1942), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1942), and ""The Leopard Man"" (1943). In the 50s he transitioned to TV. Along with ""Out of the Past"" (1947) this is one of his best film noir creations.

Over his 50 year career Lucien Ballard (1908-88) was voted Best Cinematographer at the Venice Film festival (""The Devil is a Woman"") in 1935, was Oscar nominated (""The Caretakers"") in 1963 and won an NSFC award for his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He worked with Sam Peckinpah on the TV series ""The Westerner"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""Cable Hogue"" (1970), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), and ""The Getaway"" (1972). He was a favorite cinematographer of director Budd Boetticher and worked on 7 Randolph Scott films. While he is best known for his westerns, he had an impressive list of film noir (""The Killing"", ""The Lodger"", ""Laura"").

In 1948, Bogart and Huston teamed up to make the #4 (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") and #12 (""Key Largo"") top grossing film of the year and went on to win two Oscars (Director, Supporting Actor). Other top 10 grossing films were ""The Red Shoes"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Red River"", ""Easter Parade"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""The Snake Pit"" and ""Joan of Arc"".

The NY Times praised ""realistic, awesome and impressive vista"" and Variety said ""this film etches a powerfully grim picture of life amidst the shambles. It makes awesome and exciting cinema."" The film was nominated by the WGA for best writing.

The film borders on film noir, which was popular at the time, and which actors, director, and cinematographer were experienced and adept. Certainly the photography carries the film noir trademark as does the location, the night shots, and the seedy cast of characters. We have a protagonist (Ryan) who gets sucked into a vast conspiracy and there is betrayal and double crosses galore. The only lacking element is a femme fatale.

As part of the cold war propaganda, one can see the ""bad"" Russians and the ""good"" Yanks and Brits being portrayed, yet the script also has some hope for the future. Today it seems a little bit corny, but in 1948 it was a bold statement.

Bottom line - a post war film noir with incredible photography.",1317772800,,4181,4.8787023977433
