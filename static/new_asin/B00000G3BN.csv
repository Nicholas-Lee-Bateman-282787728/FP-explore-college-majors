1214775,5,B00000G3BN,"Great scenery...fantastic music...nice little story line...but most important of all shows the contrast between an ill-prepared ,ill-concieved attempt to climb Everest(when the Hall-Fisher led groups met with disaster)  and the well prepared, level headed I-Max ""Dream Team of climbing did  it right. I would have liked to been on the recieving end of one of those  Araceli Segarra hugs when she got back to base camp. My only complaint is  that the movie wasn't twice as long.",920332800,,477,5.1558441558441555
1214776,5,B00000G3BN,"With Imax, three words always ring true...
YOU ARE THERE.
Everest is truly no exception.  Seeing the spirit behind a climb up the world's tallest mountain is incredible.  There is a lot of psychological strain  involved with this climb; just looking into one of the endless crevasses  gets me nervous and I'm watching on a TV screen.  This is definitely a film  that belongs in many collections.  Go ahead, buy the thing already!",920246400,,429,4.794520547945205
1214777,5,B00000G3BN,"Next best thing to having an IMAX screen in your home.  Made you feel like you were really there..I shivered right along with them and when they reached the summit, I cried!!!  For someone who dreams of climbing Mt.  Everest this was incredible.  Avalanches coming at the camera, footage of  the storm, and even a small clip of Rob Hall's transmissions while stuck on  the summit make this a must see.  If you've read Into Thin Air and The  Climb, or any other accounts of the 1996 Everest disaster, you MUST see  this film!!!  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.",917740800,,560,4.565656565656566

1214789,4,B00000G3BN,"Wonderful coverage of the climb, people, and incredible challenges.  I very much enjoyed the interviews with various people on the team, especially Beck Weathers.  4x3 format is a drawback, wish it were 16x9.",1493337600,,208,5.2727272727272725

1214792,3,B00000G3BN,"This was probably awesome in IMAX, but having just read Into Thin Air, and watching this on my computer, I was not overly impressed. The story is simplified to the extent that it feels like a kids' picture book. I am looking for a movie to show what it's like (to some extent) to climb Everest, and this is not the movie.",1486598400,3,321,4.193548387096774

1214850,5,B00000G3BN,"I admit I did not know about the 1996 tragedy nor had I seen any previews before watching this film. But it did not take me long to become engulfed in the start. Though Hollywood screenplays are written for entertainment and their portrayal of people and events may not be exactly accurate. After seeing the film I set out to read more about the story. As I said earlier writers are tasked with formulating characters, plots and resolutions and after reading more of the story I learn what poetic license the writer and director took. That's the reason the film starts with a disclaimer that the film is BASED on actual events. If the film was 100% accurate it would be a documentary.

I found the film to be interesting, thrilling, emotional and entertaining. That's why I have watched it several times. I would reccomend the movie even to watch with older children as younger kids may have difficulty with the death portrayed.",1473206400,,928,4.693251533742331

1214854,5,B00000G3BN,It takes me to somewhere that I probably will never be physically.  It weaves the climb with the life stories of the team members and other climbers.  Very well made and does not feel long or dragging like some documentaries could be...,1472515200,,236,4.595238095238095

1214897,5,B00000G3BN,"I have been an Everest sponge ever since watching the Everest Movie (2015 film) and have since read 2, and am currently reading 1, book(s) from the survivors of the 1996 tragedy. Knowing that an Imax team was very involved in the rescue attempts of some survivors and after reading the box of the DVD whish says ""The True Story Of The 1996.. Disaster"" I was very excited and bought this on amazon.ca. That excitement faded as I watched the film because it had very little to do with the 1996 disaster and did not offer much, if any, insight into the tragedy. I felt it was positioned as an easy cash-grab rather than show case Mt Everest itself (which is what this movie does). All in all I was pretty disappointed in the film and was tempted to return it until I saw the extra features which included a 30 min interview with Beck Weathers one of the survivors of the 1996 Everest tragedy. This video alone is worth the price of the file and is honestly the only saving grace of the entire DVD.

Notes:
Worth The Money: Yes (because of the extras)
Would I Recommend It: Yes (because of the extras)",1469232000,,1097,4.377450980392157

This film is more focused on the mountain itself from a local perspective,  perhaps explaining its title. After reading Krakauer's book, the film does not provide additional insight into the mountain and its significance to the local people, and the events of the 1996 climbing season are only an after thought.

1215128,4,B00000G3BN,"'Everest, IMAX'  is a visually thrilling, exciting and beautiful film. 45 mins in length, it consumes all of your oxygen.
This was filmed in 1996 during the terrible event on Everest when 8 climbers died in an horrific storm.

Liam Neeson narrates this film, and his voice is at once calming and stirring. In this expedition, Ed Vesturs and his new bride, Araceli Segerra, a Spanish climber, and Jamling Norgay, son if the famous Norgay who climbed Everest I with Edmund Hillary and were the first to reach the summit in 1953. A remarkable and capable crew.

Everest grows 1/4 inch a year due to the expansion and contraction of the mountain. This group was bringing equipment that would measure earthquake data and assist in the research. They would be climbing the 51/2 mile mountain Everest, 29,000 feet above sea level. Thus mountain gas several snow avalanches a day. At that time 150 people had died on the mountain, 50 of them in avalanches.

The group flew via helicopter into the mountains and then walked 30 miles to base camp. Ed's wife would stay and manage base camp, while the other three with 30 Sherpas would climb the mountain. At Camp one, they acclimated for 6 weeks. It wS at this time the storm descended on the other climbers, and the tragedy of 8 deaths occurred. Beck Wethers survived and he gas a story to tell. These three climbers waited until the storms abated and then took their turn. They made the summit and Jamling Norgay was able to make the same climb as his father before him, 46 years ago.

This visually appealing film us a must see for anyone who loves mountains, climbing and Everest. To see it at an IMAX theatre is best, but however, you see it, you will love this film.

1215130,4,B00000G3BN,"This wasn't my first time watching this IMAX film, and it probably won't be my last.

On this particular occasion, I rented the movie after watching the TV movie Death on Everest based on the work Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer. Although the movie was interesting, the acting and sets left something to be desired. I had a clearer picture of the sequence of events that night but little else. I didn't get a feel for what being on that mountain really was like. Well, as much as one can understand from the couch.

For that, I needed to watch Everest where the mountain comes to life. You get a true sense of the incredible scale and allure of the mountain, as well as the nature of the climb itself. You always hear about the exhaustion a climber feels in the Death Zone, but it doesn't really hit home until you see the climber take a single step in the snow and then breathe like they've just run a marathon. You can see into the depths of the bottomless crevasse and gaze up at the foreboding Hillary Step.

The narrative is thin and leans towards the cliche and cheesy. However, the section with the storm and the climber's reactions to the tragedy is thoughtful and poignant.

I recommend watching this on the biggest screen you can find. Unfortunately the quality is only standard but the film is still very effective.",1378339200,4,1324,4.481327800829876

1215154,4,B00000G3BN,"It seems that producers believe audience interest would lag if a film about Mt. Everest focused primarily on climbing technique and mountain scenery.  Perhaps they are correct.  In any case, the IMAX production, ""Everest,"" joins a group of similar offerings in seeking to retain the audience's attention by making human interest stories its central focus.  Some viewers may be pleased to see a personal element injected into the presentation.  But the effect can be to convert a mountain adventure into a Himalayan soap opera.  In ""Everest,"" we follow Jamling Tenzing Norgay as he seeks to emulate his father Tenzing Norgay (who, together with Edmund Hillary, was the first person to reach the summit); Ed Viesturs, a world-class climber who is spending his honeymoon on the mountain; and Araceli Segarra, who is attempting to be the first Spanish woman to reach the summit.  It is interesting to learn about them, but the process of meeting them and following them to Katmandu consumes roughly one-fourth of ""Everest""--rather too much in view of the fact that its duration is only about 42 minutes.

There are some good shots of the IMAX expedition's trek up to the base camp.  Then ""Everest"" follows the climbers through the ice fall to their middle camp.  The jewel case informs readers that ""Everest"" was ""Filmed During The Infamous 1996 Climbing Disaster Documented in Into Thin Air.""  To some this might suggest that the film is about the 1996 disaster.  But, when planning their expedition, the IMAX producers did not know there would be a disaster.  They wanted to document a climb to the summit, and just happened to be on the mountain when the disaster occurred.  The film does offer a six-minute interlude about the disaster; and this is appropriate, because some members of the IMAX expedition participated in the rescue efforts.  But there is no original footage of the storm, during which visibility was virtually nil.  The film's final eleven minutes take viewers to the top of the mountain.  There are some spectacular views of the mountain and its surroundings; but these do not adequately exploit the wide-angle panoramic potential that is the special strength of IMAX photography.  In a decision symptomatic of the film's unfortunate priorities, on breathtaking views from the summit, the producers chose to superimpose snapshots of the climbers panoplied in climbing suits that concealed both their identities and their emotions.

In a sense, the extras are better than the feature.  This is especially true of ""The Making of Everest,"" a 37-minute segment that explains how the movie was made.  In this, we learn about the logistical implications of IMAX photography.  A frame of film exposed by an IMAX camera is ten times as large as that exposed by a traditional 35mm film camera.  IMAX cameras consume film at the astronomical rate of 360 feet per minute--a 500-foot reel yields only 90 seconds of film.  Since the customary 100-pound IMAX camera was unsuitable for ""Everest,"" engineers designed a compact 40-pound version specially constructed to withstand the cold.  Four sherpas had the task of getting the camera gear up the mountain--separately assigned to carry the camera, the tripod, the film, and the batteries and other accessories.  In order to film, the camera crew had to prepare special landings for the tripod, set up all the equipment, and load the film.  Only tremendous effort and favorable weather enabled the IMAX expedition to succeed in their venture.  But this was not ""Candid Camera""--with this technology, there could be no close-up pictures of a climber ascending the Hillary Step.

""Everest"" provides five minutes of footage that was omitted from the main feature.  This is presented with music, but without commentary.  Given the costs and technical requirements of IMAX photography, all the filming was carefully planned.  And some omitted shots are so good one wonders why they were not used.  There are also the Climbers' Video Journals, in which Segarra, Norgay, and Viesturs discuss their climbing experiences.  Without doubt, the most gripping of the extras are the 36 minutes of outtakes from what must have been a lengthy interview of Beck Weathers, the Texas physician who lost both of his hands to frostbite during the 1996 storm.

1215157,3,B00000G3BN,"The extended interview with Beck Weathers was riveting!  Very intelligent, heartful man.

The Weathers interview really shows how someone just telling a story - no music, just a human recounting an experience - can mesmerize & trump the most spectacular scenery.

The documentary itself had wonderful, impressive Everest shots; but as someone else here observed, there was a ""Disney-esque"" feel about it - swelling theatrical music & not a real sense of the tragedy of what happened on Everest in May 1996.

The ""making of"" bonus material was much more interesting, esp. since it didn't have that ""you must be awed!"" IMAX music & had fewer of those somewhat condescending religious-ritual re-enactments.

I'm still woozy from that ""climber's eye view"" shot of crossing a ladder over a deep crevasse in the Icefall.

And the IMAX view of the climb of the Spanish lady up that rock-cliff in the sea was great!",1357689600,,907,4.973509933774834

1215159,1,B00000G3BN,"This video promised much and delivered little.

I am, of course, impressed by the magnitude
of the accomplishment of filming such an adventure
and of those who are such capable athletes.

The presentation of the expedition was utterly
boring other than the hair-raising ladder-bridge
chasm-crossing. (say that ten times fast).
Some of the views were truly great, but one
has to think that there is an easier way to
acquire such images than to have someone haul
an IMAX camera to the summit of Mount Everest.

There was lots of Buddhism and references to
Gods and a Goddess of the mountain.
There was the horrific and wasteful tragedy
of some fellow climbers, many of whom died
in a terrible storm on the mountain,
including one man who had a wife that was
seven months pregnant and another who was
nearly dead and lost his eyesight, both hands,
and apparently his nose to frostbite.
A daring rescue saved the life of the latter,
but what was he doing up there in the first
place.
All of this is a substantial part of the video
even though the people involved were not a part
of the team that set out with the film crew.

The only thought I had after the IMAX team
continued on their quest after the death
of eight people that they had been traveling with
was that these have got to be the stupidest people
on earth. Suicidal thrill seekers are not all that
sympathetic.

Our IMAX team succeeded in surviving the expedition.
That's a good thing.
This video, though, is not a good thing.
I would have preferred an entire video on the rock
climbing of Araceli Segarra, an amazing athlete.
The brief images of her climbing in Mexico (?)
left me wanting to see more, but the remainder
of the video didn't deliver much more.
That was one of the problems with the video:
not nearly enough climbing action or views
for which I purchased the DVD and expected to get.
Honorable mention to the aerial photography
of Katmandu, but like everything else, it was
far to brief.

This had the potential to be a really great movie,
but as it is, it is not even good enough to watch
a second time and is not a keeper.

The soundtrack is insipid ""la la la"" violin music, if the type in Ron Howard or Spielberg movies ... except, with less artistic talent. Then, in the middle of it, they show you a guy walking through ... with no nose. Does it convey the horror of the poor guy whose nose got rotted off by the pitiless winds? Does it convey the insane horror of Everest, littered with corpses? No; it makes it seem like some kind of Disney special where everyone lives happily ever after. I found that offensive. Particularly when I learned about the insane stuff which happened that year. Oh yeah, and it's over in 45 minutes. I don't care if that's IMAX standard; it's retarded.

1215200,2,B00000G3BN,"I didn't have high expectations for this film, so I can't say I was actually disappointed. I imagine this is exactly what people expect from an IMAX film when they see it in the cinema - a breathtaking visual adventure set to soaring music with an uplifting message. The cinematography is truly dazzling, and the panoramic shots of the top of the world are impressive.

Unfortunately this film fails to capture the true character of the mountain. The IMAX cameras happened to be on the mountain on the most sobering day in Everest's history, May 10 1996, when eight people died. The film does address this tragedy, and the sorrow expressed by the mountaineers in this film is authentic, however by focusing predominantly on the death of Rob Hall and the miraculous rescue of Beck Weathers, it fails to represent the horror and grief which has always been associated with summit attempts. These are recognised elements of Sherpa culture, and their religion and mountain mythology attempt to explain both triumph and struggle, but even Buddhism is Hollywoodised here as a mere sentimental gesture to gods and ancestors.

The music is also a major issue for me. It's both constant and melodramatic, giving even moments of tragedy or banality an eerily triumphant tone. Why Irish flutes and uilleann pipes feature as strongly as they do, I have no idea (because the narrator, Liam Neeson, is Irish? Because of the success of the Titanic soundtrack?), but there is no excuse for it. At a juncture of Chinese, Tibetan, Indian and Nepalese cultures, there's rich material for a very dramatic musical score that doesn't sound like it was composed by the people who made Riverdance.

Ultimately the film's failure is that it doesn't convey the sheer physical struggle of the climb, especially in the death zone, where even healthy climbers are unable to function normally. That struggle is interesting, and I wanted to understand it. Unfortunately the combination of blue skies, dazzling white snow and a booming orchestral crescendo means the audience emotionally reaches the summit while the climbers themselves are still cheating death one painful step at a time. With the summit in sight, it seems that the quest is all but over. Never mind that many climbers are forced to turn back so close to the top, that the summit itself can be deadly, or that the trip back down the mountain is often more dangerous and fraught than the ascent.

Cinematography aside, Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" will leave you with a more truthful, and not less compelling, impression of Everest.",1284249600,9,2569,4.953596287703016

1215206,2,B00000G3BN,"If you're into eye candy, this will fit the bill.  But given the context of the 1996 disaster on Everset and Krakauer's book about it, this is a strange film, made during a  historic disaster on Everest and barely mentioning it even though the film crew was part of the attempt at the rescue. It's very odd that this whole thing is only about 45 minutes, given the scale and scope of what happened in May 1996.  As for that, the best part of the DVD is the extended interview with Beck Weathers, in the bonus stuff, not in the film itself.  Here in the obligatory thrown in stuff you have the real story of what really happened in May 1996 on Everest.  Beck Is a movie unto himself, as is the whole May 10-12 effort of everyone who was up there then, including the Imax film project.  Their efforts to help the stranded hikers way up above, including offering to give up oxygen tanks to potential rescue teams, gets barely a mention.  Come on! Give yourselves some  credit other than in the Bonus Material! In the main, this is a self-indulgent piece of cinematography, fun to look at, but edited in the wrong way for the conditions under which it was actually filmed and in which the film crew actually  experienced the disaster. It had the potential to  capitalize on its situation, adapt, adopt abd improvise, but it seems that the predetermined script held sway. Consider also most of what is in the bonus features--the suits, sitting on snow capped peaks (not Everest) much later talking about how the goal of the movie was to make a movie and bring some heavy camera equipment to the top of Everest.  They missed a historic opportunity to grab what happened and instead stuck to just a mundane let's-get-the-camera-to-the-top visual spectacular.

Moreover, this climb coincided with a far more fateful one in which several climbers perished.

1215240,5,B00000G3BN,"Grab this DVD! If you're one of those who sees a run time of ""45 minutes"" and that tends to keep you moving on, don't, because there are various bonus extras on the DVD so that 'hours' of viewing is a more equitable consideration.

First of all and in addition to the 45 minute IMAX film there is the ""Making of Everest"" which goes into much detail and what happened during filming when the unrelated to the IMAX film 1996 Everest tragedy struck during filming and the effect of that tragedy therein. So too, there is an extended and fairly lengthy bonus interview with Dr. Beck Weathers who was part of the 1996 Everest tragedy and this extended interview is particularly moving. Then there are deleted scenes as well as climber video journals.

Speaking of Dr. Beck Weathers, I'll tell you, that extended interview was 'so' compelling and moving to watch that one would have to be made of stone not to be affected by it. He says, among other observations, when he gave up his place on the helicopter rescue [** there was only room for 'one' passenger besides the pilot due to altitude and weight considerations] to another critically injured man and not knowing whether the helo could even 'make' another return landing attempt at such high altitude [** it had never been done before [1996] at least at C1 [Camp 1] where others of the climbing community had gotten a partially frozen and almost fully blinded [by his injuries] Dr. Weathers down from Camp 4 which he managed to reach on his own] , ""You have to have some sense that you behaved well ... that you did the right thing ..."" and about the helo pilot [Col. Madan] who in fact came back a second time when another landing was precarious at best, ""I think he did it because he 'does' have a brave heart ... ."" These moments and others when Dr. Weathers recounts the horror where even his wife was informed that he was ""confirmed dead"" [sic] and then some hours later she gets another call saying, ""It looks like he's not dead after all [!] ... but he's critically injured"" and the part about being placed into the tent when he staggered into Camp 4 and administered to at least to the extent possible in an obviously isolated area but essentially, and ironically, since he had already been left for dead in the snow before getting up and staggering on to Camp IV, he's 'again' left for dead in the tent because the feeling was that no matter what medical aid had now been rendered to him, he was thought to be too far gone to survive his horrendous condition [** both his frozen hands were subsequently amputated as well as his nose, et al] and he underwent extensive reconstructive facial surgeries [plural]. It's a powerful and gripping interview and well extended from his comments in the IMAX film itself.

The film is spectacular and while you're not going to get what IMAX viewers experienced in those multiple 10-story high IMAX screens, it is nevertheless  breathtaking in scope. Like various others, I follow the goings-on of both Everest and K2 climbing expeditions and endeavors .. and the often high 'cost' of those summits. It once again makes the 'fact' that accidents/disasters on places like Everest and K2 [et al] happen more on the 'descent' versus the 'ascent' where the weather or sudden serac fallings are always an often unpredictable factor to reckon with as the recent disaster on K2 [August 1, 2008], where 11 seasoned climbers were killed, tragically demonstrates.

Since Edmund Hillary first summited Everest in 1953, over 150 people have died trying to scale its heights (about a third of them by avalanche). This interesting if short (45 minutes) film documents a successful 1996 IMAX expedition by three climbers--Jamling Tenzin Norgay, whose father accompanied Hillary; Araceli Segarra, the first Spanish woman to ever reach the top; and Ed Viesturs, a professional climber who also happens to use this trip as his honeymoon. As fate would have it, their climb occured at the same time as the disaster documented in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air when New Zealander Rob Hall and seven others were caught in a storm and killed. Spectacular scenery takes you to the crevasses and cols, the gale winds, snug tents, base camps, and minus-100 temperatures. But the successful climb that the film documents is overshadowed by our knowledge that the ""real story"" at that time was about Hall and his ill-fated companions. A powerfully emotional interview with Beck Weathers, a survivor of the Hall expedition who lost both hands and part of his face to frostbite, is a ""special feature"" of the DVD that makes watching this otherwise interesting film all the more worthwhile.

This is not, I repeat NOT, a film about the events that happened to Rob Hall's and Scott Fisher's commercial teams in 1996. IF you did actually read the book (which I doubt some of the reviewers have since they seem to be so confused) ""Into Thin Air"" you would have known that the IMAX team was a completely different team, made up of world class climbers, that was filming their OWN documentery about climbing Everest. They agreed to attempt the summit at a latter date than the two above mentioned teams so as to not get in the way. Get it? This is a flim about Everest and attempting to conquer it and NOT about those tragic events. Yes, it does touch upon these because the IMAX team was on the mountain when they happened and because they were instrumential in helping many of the stricken climbers. This team dropped its own summit asperations to help the other climbs by donating their equipment (batteries, oxygen, and such) to the other climbers and even helping some of the stricken climbers down. Now, having said all that, this is a breathtakingly beautifully shot film with impressive panaramic visuals and helps the other 99.9% of the rest of us who will never climb Everest to gain some sort of insight into what it takes to overcome this uncaring mountain. I am also fully impressed by that fact that someone had to carry the camera and film up the mountain! That is an amazing feat by itself. I highly recommend this film to anyone, however if you are looking for a film about the tragic events that occured in 1996 this is not it!

This movie of course if filled with realism and Liam is a great narrator.  It touches on the Everest catastrophe of 1997 and you can see some of the real people involved in that, not cheesy actors as from the other movie.  ""Everest"" is not the greatest IMAX movie you would ever see, but the realism makes up for it.

1215303,3,B00000G3BN,"ok, so i haven't watched this film yet.  but i did want to address a couple of things said in other reviews.

1)  the movie is short because it was shot on the 65mm film used for imax, which goes through over 5 feet of film per second.  most imax films are 30-60 minutes.  even if they weren't, you're simply not going to haul that much 65mm film up everest.  90 seconds worth of 65mm film weighs a couple pounds.

2)  this movie has nothing to do with the disaster, because a) that was not what the movie was supposed to do and b) they were busy helping instead of filming.  the team immediately gave away much of their bottled oxygen supply to relief efforts & lent their team of sherpas to support.  co-director & cameraman david breashears personally carried down a near-fatally wounded man.

3)  if it has a disney-esque feel to it, that's probably because a disney owned company financed the picture.

hope this helps.",1137715200,,924,4.461077844311378
1215304,4,B00000G3BN,"Has some great shots of the mountain, you ""kind of"" get a feel for how it would be to climb it.  You don't really get too attached the characters, but who cares about them, you're watching it for the mountain.  A couple things:  the movie doesn't make the climb look all that dangerous, and lacks any drama that you might expect to see in a movie about climbing everest (even the part where they talk about the '96 disaster is intentionally played down).

The makers of the film seemed to want to give the movie a ""G"" rated Disney feeling and do so successfully.  I'd recommend it, but due to how short it is relative to others, and the lack of showing the true hardships of the mountain, I'd recommend other Everest videos before this one.  My favorite Everest film so far is NGC's ""50 Years on the Mountain"" NOT to be confused with Surviving Everest, which is completely awful and a sad waste of money.

1215305,5,B00000G3BN,"The actual IMAX film loses something in translation to a smaller screen. We watched on a 62"" HDTV, but you don't get a feel for the great expanse that IMAX intended. I'd still go see it if it comes back to the local IMAX theater.

Yes, the story is slightly bland like other reviews stated, but still fascinating that people would put themselves through the physical challenge of climbing Everest. I felt that watching the 1997 NOVA Everest special (also available on DVD) on the effects of climbing at high altitudes, helped me to understand what the climbers were going through.

That said, the ""Making of Everest"" on this DVD was wonderful. They delved into the climbing tragedies that affected the making of the film and you also hear from the filmakers about how they felt while all this was going on. There is also an ""Extended Interview with Beck Whethers"" that is just so emotionally touching, you'll believe in miracles.

If you can get past the fact that the scenery of the film won't have the impact of seeing it shown 7 stories tall wrapping around you, it's a truely fascinating DVD. Almost makes me want to go there (or at least read more on what motivates these high altitude climbers)!",1122508800,5,1201,4.65566037735849

The movie is ""peppered"" with video-game-like graphics.  I've honestly seen better ornamentation in corporate PowerPoint presentations.  The viewer gets no sense of the drama of what actually occurred (at least 7 people died on Everest while the film was shot).  Liam Neeson's narration only heightens the artificial feel of this film.  There has been much talk of the frozen bodies still on Everest.  You will not find them in this Disney-esque feature.  If you're thinking ""K2"" or ""Vertical Limit,"" you are way off base.  Heidi's climb to Grandpapa's chalet in the 1968 classic was more action-packed and realistically staged.",1119830400,6,793,5.038461538461538

The 3 climbers that are profiled in this film each have interesting stories to tell and their final conquest of Everest is a wonderful experience to be shared!  This is one of the best IMAX productions I have ever seen and a powerful and amazing documentary of how nature's elements can be a devastating event for climbers!

For those fortunate to see the IMAX version of this same film I can only imagine how wonderful the views of the top of the world must be. ""Everest"" is a dramatic story - a daring adventure of triumph over tragedy surrounding the events of the storm that claimed eight lives at the top of Mt Everest in 1996.

The film is narrated by Liam Neeson who does an excellent job of narration. ""Everest"" will take you over creaking icefalls and gaping chasms, up dangerous, towering cliffs until you are standing on the summit of Mt Everest along with the climbers.",1104364800,3,627,4.452173913043478

They are impressive people and what they did in the service of the hapless climbers (putting their expedition on hold to help the rescue efforts, lending their oxygen tanks, etc.) should all by itself have made an incredible story. Beck Weathers' incredible against-all-odds survival and the heroism of the Nepali Air Force chopper pilot who rescued him are in the movie but could have figured larger. In fact, there was so much more that could have been done with this movie that it was almost anticlimactic to watch. Very disappointing, considering the subject. Also, the visuals were by-and-large not as impressive as previous IMAX movies I have seen. If you want to experience a real nail-biting version of the Everest disaster of 1996 you must read Jon Krakauer's excellent and definitive book ""Into Thin Air.""

1215362,5,B00000G3BN,"Since reading ""Into Thin Air"", I have become a virtual Everest '96 hound, and this is my first quarry.  The IMAX team's goal on Everest was to film David Breashear's expedition in that fateful year, focusing primarily on Ed Viesturs, a seasoned climber from the States, and Araceli Segarra, in her quest to be the first Spanish woman to reach the summit.  A lot of attention, deservedly so, is paid as well to Jangbu Sherpa, son of Tenzing Sherpa who accompanied Sir Edmund Hilary in his premier trip to the summit.
And watching these climbers was riveting--ascending sheer sheets of ice, yards high, that look as though they are leaning in towards the climber; crossing bottomless chasms by placing an aluminum work ladder from one side to the other, and using it as a bridge; and feeling (in part through the excellent cinematography) the pull the mountain exerts on them to continue on.  But I was floored, completely, by the thought of the cinematic team following along, all the way to the top, regardless of the weight and awkwardness of the equipment. For example, in the aforementioned aluminum ladder scene, shots seem to be taken from each side of the chasm.  Had they carried that heavy equipment accross that ladder?  And, once they came down from such a difficult and draining climb,  they still managed to piece together a marvelous film.
The cinematography, once again, is gorgeous.  Shots of the mountain convey not only its beauty, but its terrifying danger, as ice and whirling snow tower over the climbers, as a rescue helicopter wavers, uncertainly, as Liam Nelson explains the scientific impossibility of a helicopter to work in such thin air (it does).  Seeing the Icefall alone, I think, was worth the price I paid for the video.
Warning:  If you get this movie expecting it to be a documentary covering the Adventure Consultants  and Mountain Madness Expeditions, chronicled in ""Into Thin Air"", you will be disappointed.  The IMAX expedition was unrelated to the others, and of course the crew could not predict that those expeditions might yield more interesting, if tragic, results.  But the teams do interact with each other when it becomes clear that members are facing unexpected danger. I enjoyed ""meeting"" many of the folks I had read about.
Finally, ""Everest"", the film, stands on its own.  With a terrific story in Araceli Segarra, wonderful images from Utah and Spain as well as Nepal, and a score assisted by George Harrison melodies, it provides a great armchair journey to the top of the world.",1088553600,154,2531,4.899297423887588
1215363,5,B00000G3BN,"I am professional outdoor/aerial photographer from Alaska who has seen grandeur of mother nature which would make most people cry in utter awe. This movie reminds me of spending quality time at Denali (Mt. McKinley) climber's basecamp at 7,300 feet. With 14,000 to 20,320 foot peaks and the constant rumbling of avalanches all around you, you get a sense of ""total sensory overload"". This DVD is as real as big mountains get when placed onto the big silver screen or your home TV.  The ""extra"" parts to the DVD make it even more worth buying!

This movie is also a godsend for the tourism in Nepal and Himalayan Region. The sheer maginitude of the Himalayas is shown here on this movie is as deep as the human spirt and as tall as the sky. However, to see this visuals from the elevation these climbers see it, you risk AMS, HAPE, HACE, snow blindness, avalanches and/or most certainly death for any small mistake in judgement.
David Breashers deserves a medal of international honour for making such a masterpiece of a documentary. In addition, I wish pay a great tribute to the late George Harrison for making such awe-inspiring and chilling music scores for the backdrop of this movie. If you were moved this movie on DVD, you owe it to yourself to buy the audio CD soundtrack as well. Every you go where Mother Nature shows off her wonders, take the CD with you and get inspired. When you listen to the audio CD, you can visualize the raw beauty of the Everest region and seens from the DVD in your mind.
May the climbers from the 1996 Everest Disaster rest in peace. Also to all potential Everest climbers, you need to learn from these climbers fatal mistakes before you become a statistic yourself. As Ed Viesturs says regarding risk and climbing, ""Getting to the top is optional, getting down is mandatory"".

1215364,5,B00000G3BN,"The images in this film are absolutely stunning--crisp, colorful, and so real that they barely seem one-dimensional.  The deadly beauty of Everest comes through loud and clear:  sheer ice falls; huge chasms that must be crossed by way of precarious stepladders flung across them; avalanches; blizzards; subzero degree temperatures; sheer drops on either side of narrow, narrow trails.  One can feels frozen and short of breath watching this film.
But the beauty notwithstanding, what especially intrigues me about the film is the obsession that the mountaineers have to scale Everest.  Part of the story of the film details the multiple deaths in a party trapped in a storm on Everest's slope.  The leader of the party had a seven-month pregnant wife; all the other slain climbers had loved ones they left behind; the survivors placed rescuers--helicopter pilots and other mountaineers--in jeopardy.  Is so much death and threat of death worthwhile?  Isn't there a certain point where responsibility for others trumps a desire to stand on the ""top of the world""?  The film doesn't explore these questions, nor the issue of why so many people have such a compulsion to scale Everest.

The visuals are simple stunning.  Fantastic, sweeping landscape shots.  Wonderful interviews on the mountain.  Great narration from Liam.
I was thinking that they would have covered more of the tragic ascent that season, but they do touch upon it and include an interview with one of the survivors.  Nonetheless, if you've read ""Into thin air"" or ""The Climb"" this DVD is a must to help visualize what these people face.
The last shots of the climbers literally having to pull their feet out of the snow and force out another step helps demonstrate why the climbing of Everest is dangerous and practically impossible.
The subjects are very likeable and each has their reason for going on the expedetion.  There's some really nice pre-everest training shots as well in Utah and in Spain that are really stunning.",1068076800,3,918,4.896774193548387

I originally saw it in the IMAX format on the big screen, but the DVD transfer is stunning. Very little quality has been lost, either visually or in the audio segments. This is a high quality production from beginning to end, and you will not want this film to end!
Though only 44 minutes in length, you can watch it repeatedly and always take something new from the experience. What I most enjoy about this movie is that you get to know the climbers that are profiled. You get to see them training for the gruelling Everest experience months in advance in their home countries. Various climbers are shown bicycling through the Arizona desert or rock climbing in Spain. They are interviewed and you're allowed a little window into their soul, so when they struggle on the mountain, you have empathy and understanding of their plight. The characterizations of the climbers are like getting to know people in novels, it's unusual in a documentary, but very compelling.
The movie is magical in its visual beauty. The vistas are crisp, clear and sharp. The narration by Liam Neesom is understated, elegant and never intrusive. The ending credits play a stunning live version of the Beatles classic 1969 hit, ""Here Comes the Sun"" sung by George Harrison, recorded in Japan. All in all, this is a film of mastery.

For David Brashears, Jamling Norgay and Araceli Cegarra, another big BRAVO for the effort displayed.  What a must sorry matter that this film was being held while the 1996 tragedy took the lives of several climbers.

This isn't Hollywood-they don't always focus on the deaths, ya know.  It was explained in this film that the folks on the expedition chose to wait out a storm and watched the other parties ascend only to hear of the climbers that were stranded.  When one that had fought his way back down came into contact with the filming crew, they put the gear down and did everything needed to save the man's life.  And this reviewer was upset by that?!!?
The ""making of"" section is almost more interesting than the actual movie.  The main feature is really too short for my taste.  The camera work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is a perfect match but it is all too brief.

If you like this DVD, then be sure to read the two books mentioned earlier, they are very well written. As for the rest of the film, the footage is breathtaking. From Kathmandu, to the southeast ridge, the IMAX film crew did a great job of getting everything in with the small amount of footage they had. The film is just the beginning too.

The cinematography is breathtaking.  It put me right on the mountain and there I was, gasping for air with the climbers, putting one booted foot after another on a rickety aluminum ladder suspended over a deep crevasse, pounding spikes into ice in spite of exhaustion, and feeling the cold and the wind and the fear of ice falls and avalanches.
All that in 44 minutes.  Wow!
The human stories were all there too.  Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa climber, whose Buddhist faith and example of his father who was one of the first men to reach Everest in 1953 made this climb a religious experience for him; Ed Viesturs, an experienced American mountain climber on his honeymoon; and Araceli Segarra, an award-winning mountain climber in her native Spain, striving to be  the first Spanish woman to reach the summit.
This team didn't expect it, but they were plunged into the drama of five deaths and extreme courage of the subjects of the book ""Into Thin Air"".  They assisted with the rescue and then made a decision to continue.
I must say I held my breath as the camera traveled with them all the way up to the summit.

1215434,4,B00000G3BN,"Having seen a few Everest videos, this one is at the top. Wheareas the IMAX format affords a clear and crisp panorama of the climb and the descent, it is really the bonus cuts which make the DVD worth a viewing, in particular: the computer-generated 3D climbing route and vista from the summit, the interviews with the 3 featured climbers, and the thoughtful and methodical introspection of a climber rescued after a near-death experience, Dr. Beck Weathers!  The video could have given the viewer a better background on the mountain itself. Its 3D graphics, though clear, reminded me of the graphics from my son's video games of a few years ago.  To the moviemakers' credit, they justly call the Sherpas who toted their equipment and supplies (some of it all the way to the summit), ""the real heroes of the expedition."" Among world-class climbers, such acknowledgement and attribution are rare.  Finally, of special note are the comments of Jamling Norgay, the son of Tensing Norgay, the first climber, along with Edmund Hillary, of Everest in the 1950s.

Everest puts you on site of the tallest mountain in the world. David Breashears shows the training and tribulation of the mountain that everyone goes through. The movie was filmed during the 1996 climbing dissaster. The expedition was halted to help rescue these climbers. The making of Everest documents this disaster.
The Making Of Everest also has tons of information on the IMAX film and the hiking team. The team was composed of many climbers including a rock climber from Mexico and a Sherpa, whose father was with the first ever to climb Everest. The IMAX film is 10 times sharper and can be shown clearly on screens up to 7 stories high. One reel weighs 10 pounds and only get 90 seconds of video.

What I got was much different than I had  expected, to say the least.  After I had recovered from the damage of my  expectations I realized that the footage the crew captured was truly  breathtaking, not so much because of great cinemaphotography but more over  because they had gotten any footage at all.  I loved this DVD because I was  shown a part of the world I'll likely never see and I am grateful a crew  risked their lives to bring this to film.

Everest
I wanted to take a second to address one reviewer's thoughts:
Reviewer:  William  from Texas  January 16, 2000  If you've read ""Into Thin  Air"", you'll be disappointed in the film's inability to capture the  human drama and hardships of the climbers. It is interesting, however, to  see the scenery that you read about in the book. The film is only 45  minutes long - not a real good price-performer. The additional material is  very good though - the interview with Beck Weathers is by far the most  impactful piece of this disk.
  * * *
And if you read  ""Into Thin Air"" you will also notice that it was written by Jon  Krakauer who was not even a member of Ed Viesturs team. ""Everest""  is an account of Ed Viesturs' team and *their* experience climbing to the  top of Mount Everest. Of of the 4 teams that got stranded on top of Everest  on that fateful night, there were people that had ""no business being  there"". I cannot remember whether it was Ed Viesturs or Aracelli but  that's a direct quote from one of Viesturs team members. ""Many teams  lacked a critical amount of experience"" was another quote from  Viesturs.
Ed Viesturs' team was the ""dream team"" of mountain  climbers. They assembled a great cast of leaders, a great support team,  they planned the entire trip from the start, and as luck would have it, the  ""Gods"" were on their side as well. They also made the right  decisions at the right time which certainly helped to avoid a lot of the  hardships other teams had to face. Jamling Norgay (having been born in  Tibet) and his team of ""sherpas"" had lived in the Himalayas all  their lives. If anyone knew about survival tricks and tactics living in the  Himalayas it would be Jamling Norgay. Of course he was able to pass along  his wisdom and insights to the rest of the team. It is not discussed in  detail in the movie, but Viesturs team was probably very well financed.  This results in better clothing, equipment, better food and/or more food.  After all, Imax (as well as some Geological survey team) was sponsoring  this event from the start. It's hard to do a film when you don't have the  tools you need to do your job right. They had to haul a 40 pound camera all  the way to the summit. Think that's easy?  Jon Krakauer didn't have 30  pound rolls of film strapped to his back. Somebody had to carry that  camera, all those rolls of film, tripod, and so forth up the summit (and  back down). So in one sense Viesturs' team had to endure a lot more than  the other teams did. And just to give you an idea of how important weight  was, the climbers were cutting their toothbrushes in half just to save some  weight! Yes, you heard me right, they were shaving off every little once  just to make it *THAT* much easier to pull themselves up the ice! That 40  lb camera probably felt more like 100 lbs at the summit.
Yes, the movie  is only 45 minutes long, but you have to look at this in the context of  what you are seeing. You are climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain  in the world.
You can't compare this to say, the beautiful beaches of  Hawaii where anyone can go and shoot a scene. You can't compare this to the  Sierra Nevada because that area is easily accessible.
There's only 1/3  the oxygen level up there so there's nothing for the rotors of a helicopter  to bite onto. It's not like you can just fly up there with a camera and  shoot because you might get killed.
Everest is a place where neither man  nor machine is welcome and that makes this video VERY special.
Off to the  side, this DVD is chock filled with extra features. In addition to the Beck  Weathers interview, there's ""The Making of Everest"" which was  about 45 minutes in length. I found this to be very informative and enjoyed  it as much as the movie.
There's a ""3D Map"" which gives an  computer generated image overview of Everest. Within this ""3D  Map"" there's ""Camp Information"" (info on Base Camp, Middle  Camp and High Camp) as well as the ""Climber's Perspective"" (a  short description of that part of the mountain).
There's a set of  ""Climber's Video Journals"" which is an up close video of 3 of the  climbers.
Lastly, there's ""Deleted Scenes"" which are all the  scenes that did not make the final cut. So actually you do get quite of bit  of ""bang"" for your ""buck"". Well over 2 1/2 hours worth  of film I would guess.
As for one reviewer below who was complaining that  they could have made this longer and more into a ""feature"" film:
This isn't supposed to be a full length feature film. All of IMAX's  films are around 45 minutes. It's more of a documentary, and this film has  absolutely stunning cinematography for a documentary.
I've seen several  IMAX movies before since I was a small child. The first time being at  Mariott's Great America about 15 years ago where (at the time) it was only  one of two IMAX movie screens in the entire world. This is the best IMAX  movie I've ever seen. From the reviews I've read on IMAX's other films  being sold on Amazon dot Com ""Everest"" gets the highest ratings  by far. And even though you probably won't be able to see this on an IMAX  screen, a big screen TV will still provide you with plenty of beautiful  stills that will make you want to watch this over and over. If you have a  DVD player, definitely add this one to your collection!",950054400,182,5445,4.454268292682927
1215471,3,B00000G3BN,"This is a good film overall, and has quality DVD images, photography and sound. What lacks though is any length or suspense to the film. I think more editing at the tables could have made this film more of a feature. The  photography is just that, snap shots. The narrative is scripted, and much  of the climb in the film recreated not at Everest, but instead in the  United States. Special features of the DVD fall short of what to be  expected for the purchase price, such as a trailer not even for this film,  but for another. The extended Beck Weathers interview is better than the  film. For Everest documentaries, look for National Geographic specials.

I try to be there through  them and to experience what they feel. This is not about the tragedy in  1996; it was only coincidence that the deaths occurred at the same time. It  is not a documentary about the mountain or about Nepal. This is about human  effort and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their  dreams....and about dreams realized.

What I got was a dull narrative, a bunch of scenes that do not belong on 70mm (packing / unpacking / talking on a telephone / assembly-line lunch) and very little  footage of the mountain or climbing.  Why would I want to see this on DVD  or VHS without the benefit of WideScreen footage anyway?  I am pretty  disappointed with the whole package.  I would guess that the camera crew go  gun-shy after the tradgedy that claimed 8 lives.  As a result, we see the  rear of the climbers, mostly, and shots from conservative angles.  They  said that helicopters had a hard time getting up that high due to the lack  of air.  What about aeroplane shots?  I think this project, derailed by  tragedy, should have stayed that way.  The result is piecemeal, at best.  Some nice deleted scenes, though.

If you read Krakauer's book, you'll  realize what the movie and the book should be used for...to enjoy Everest  from afar and leave the summit to the lucky few in the world that have the  ability and stamina to make it.

A viewer from Santa Barbara, CA. , May 21, 1999 called Everest a ""Fantasy flick"" IMAX  has only extended the far-fetched dream of Everest to the masses of  unexperienced people who might be led to think that climbing Everest is not  an exceptional feat. I read these reviews before watching the movie and I  can honestly say: The only fantasy in the film is the life the viewer from  Santa Barbara is living in. Oh my god, where do I begin? This flick is  filled with nothing but harsh atrocities and unbelievable camera angles.  Camera crews managed to capture portions of the worst disaster in the  history of Mt. Everest. This includes the last conversation between Rob  Hall and his wife (7 months pregnant) as they named their unborn baby  before Hall's untimely death. If that didn't pull at your heart then you  don't have a pulse. The team was forced to cross icy crevices over 25 feet  in length over a makeshift aluminum ladder pulled together with some blue  rope. Beck (part of Hall's party), nearly lost his life. Instead he wound  up losing both hands to frostbite, half of his nose, and two of his toes.  And they even had the gruesome before and after closeup photos to  punctuate. The loss of life of half of Hall's party. The use of oxygen  canisters due to the lack of oxygen. The grueling bike training over the  desert. You call this your ""basic summer vacation""?!? I'd like to  know what do during your summer vacations mkirkland! Then again, maybe not.  This film is harsh, period. Anyone who says otherwise like the boneheads  above are full of it.
