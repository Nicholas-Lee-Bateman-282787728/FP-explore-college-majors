8683906,5,B00OJN1YGS,"This fourth in a four-part DVD series brings the set into a whole. You've already learned how to improve your visual, tactile and auditory reflexes (you have watched the previous three, right?). Now, you learn how to build blinding speed upon those quick reflexes. It's great to have fast reflexes, but that won't make a difference if you can't quickly strike or move; that's why this DVD brings everything together. Sammy does a great job of explaining these exercises. I especially liked the weighted vest and dumbbell punching exercises.",1415232000,,540,5.078651685393258
