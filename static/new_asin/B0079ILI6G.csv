5066588,5,B0079ILI6G,"This is one of the best adaptations of the marvel universe I've seen since the old spider man and x-men shows of the 90's. This is just like this accept its more 21st century, its faster paced, there's so many villains because of the shear ammount of marvel lore that its can be daunting to keep track of whos whos. everything I've said so far makes a show absolutly spectactular because god forbid it makes you use your brain.

At ant rate This is tottally worth the price and also you can catch the first season for free on netflx but then support amazon and buy the second season.",1336089600,7,583,4.348623853211009
5066622,5,B0079ILI6G,"For those who haven't experienced Marvel overload yet, this show is a must-watch!  Easily the best animated adaptation of not just the Avengers, but perhaps any Marvel story.
The key to this show are the characters and the storytelling. The animation is modern and quite good, though I would prefer more detail and better backgrounds; it's good, but it could be better - see ""Young Justice"".
The stories however are stellar. Reaching into the entire Marvel pantheon, this cartoon does all it can to satisfy even the most die-hard Marvel fan. From original costuming, to featuring some underused villains, this show creates a very legit animated Marvel continuity.

The Blu Ray has a pretty sharp picture and really good HD sound. Features 6 interviews which last about 2 mins, with no other extra features.
Season 2 comes on an entirely separate volume.",1510099200,,853,5.0

5066624,5,B0079ILI6G,"My son, an expert in all these comic books, absolutely loves this series. This is 1 of the best animated Marvel shows he's watched. Exceeded by only 2 series.",1503360000,2,158,4.482758620689655
5066625,4,B0079ILI6G,"There is such a wealth out there now of superhero stories, and a ton of Avengers stories many of which get regurgitated so that we see the same histories developed with minor tweaks and modifications over and over and over again, so that it begs the question of why one should check out Avengers Season 1 when there are a variety of other options? I think thats a good question. The answer is simple: this series takes its time in developing and introducing the characters, and in bringing them together. It takes its sweet time so while you can jump in and watch whatever episode title might catch your fancy or based on your favorite character but the true reward for the patient viewer is to start at the beginning and savor. This may move too slow for some, and Ill admit that at times I began to get anxious for the team to come together and get to avenging, but in the end I appreciated that they took the time to develop and so to spotlight these characters. The team doesnt really gel in this first season, they're still working the kinks out and theres still plenty of smaller threads to pull on and to follow through the season (my favorite being the dynamic between Hawkeye and the Black Widow and how Hawks reacts to being betrayed by the Widow), and they put enough spin on some classic storylines like Masters of Evil that even for those familiar with those story threads will find them approached differently. As for the animation fans of classic Warner Bros. DC animation of Batman and especially Superman and the newer Justice League are sure to enjoy this blocky style that never has too much going on in the back- or foreground but just enough to fill it all out. I prefer a more detailed animation, but this still works.

A couple of my personal fave eps from this season have to be Hulk Versus the World with Hawkeye and Black Widow stopping the jolly green giant and The Man In the Ant Hill which focused on Hank Pym and Janet van Dynes interpersonal dynamic (her zest for living life and his desire to remain the humane scientist with hopes to rehab criminals). My wife, who joins me on my superhero excursions, also enjoyed this season and were both looking for more. 4.5 stars.",1502582400,2,2202,4.505
5066626,5,B0079ILI6G,"It's so very rare that we get ensemble superhero serials that are done right, and this is truly one of the best, standing easily alongside DC's Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. The characters are well-written, and the stories are pulled from classic comics of the the silver age through the modern era, and the interpretations appropriately updated. The animation is stylistic but extremely competent, bright, and looks fantastic. The story actually progresses, the villains are menacing, and it's just a joy to watch. And there's humor of the witty and well-written variety -- not the tired slapstick and Vaudvillian schlock that you'll find in ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" and ""Hulk: Agents of S.M.A.S.H.""

A side note: Don't confuse this masterpiece with ""Avengers Assemble,"" which is an awful cartoon that exists in the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" & ""Agents of S.M.A.S.H."" universe. That series has the Avengers fighting the Red Skull in an Iron Man suit -- for some reason -- and a bunch of Z-list villains including the worst representation of Dracula in anything, well, EVER. The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes is superior to that pile of garbage in every single way (as it actually takes time to develop its characters and put them against classic villains rather than just having mindless and pointless fights every single episode). The easy way to tell which one you're getting is by looking at Hawkeye -- if he's got on his classic point-mask costume, it's good, but if he's wearing sunglasses, it's not.

So remember, Earth's Mightiest Heroes = Good. Avengers Assemble = So, so bad. Make the right choice. Buy this series!",1501286400,2,1637,5.127340823970037

The scripts are well and intelligently written, and the approach, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is to start by introducing the main players in their own solo adventures, and then create the Avengers team.  It's simple enough to understand for younger viewers and yet not simplistic, incorporating enough complexity of character and politics to intrigue their parents as well.

They introduced us to Wasp, Ant-Man, THE REAL YELLOWJACKET(lol), Ultron, The Negative Zone, Black Panther, etc..I would recommend watching this in addition to the comics for the respective material, even before you see the movies so you can get some background information about your heros and their battlers.

5066814,5,B0079ILI6G,"I will try to keep this short and sweet:  Earth's Mightiest Heroes (EMH) is, hands-down, the greatest superhero/comic-based animated series ever produced.  The characters are intelligently developed, the voice acting and animation are outstanding (by the way, it is glorious HAND-DRAWN animation, not that computer-generated crap that dominates modern cartoons), and the writing is brilliant, riveting, and refreshingly faithful to the classic source material.  (The latter point is perhaps this show's most endearing quality.)  Moreover, EMH benefits from being presented in a serial, as opposed to episodic, format, resulting in smooth continuity between story plots and character arcs throughout both seasons.  Captain America especially shines in this series -- so much so that Cap became my favorite superhero (alongside Superman) after watching this show.  In fact, you'll never find a more perfect portrayal of the Steve Rogers character ANYWHERE.  Indeed, as admirable of a job as Chris Evans has done with the big screen adaptation of the Sentinel of Liberty, he doesn't even come close to Brian Bloom's definitive interpretation of Cap.

If I have any complaints about EMH, it would be these two:  (1) Some of the female characters (Black Widow, in particular) are inappropriately/provocatively rendered and sexually objectified, which is both inexcusable and, frankly, shocking for a children-oriented cartoon series; and (2) Season 3 never happened.  The latter fact is simply tragic, because the series (Avengers Assemble) that replaced this gem is insipid, childish pap that was created for the sole purpose of promoting the Marvel Cinematic Universe Avengers films and whose writers are overtly (and obnoxiously) biased toward the Iron Man/Tony Stark character (e.g., Cap, who should be the recognized leader, constantly has to play second fiddle to Stark, is made to look incompetent and helpless without his aid, and literally has to eat crow and say, ""You were right, Tony!"" to the reckless egomaniac before the end of almost every episode -- TOTALLY backwards relationship/roles!).  So, don't waste your time with Avengers Assemble.  The only animated Avengers series that matters is the matchless Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  Buy both seasons on Blu-ray NOW, and remember that you may save much money by ordering it through Amazon Canada, as I did!",1442102400,2,2366,5.484848484848484

5066861,5,B0079ILI6G,"If you're buying this then I don't need to tell you how awesome this series is.  Sadly despite it's awesomeness it has yet to receive a North American Bluray release, or even DVD season sets.  In Canada however they were released, which makes this an import.  First I will say that these are much cheaper on Amazon.ca.  I paid $26 for both seasons which included shipping.  The only down side is I had to wait almost a month for them to arrive.

Once it did though I was quite pleased.  While it's a bit annoying that everything on the package is written in French as well a English that alone is a pretty minor complaint.  Inside under the disk trays are lists of episodes which is a nice touch.  The disks themselves each house 13 episodes and the Bluray itself is entirely in English.  The HD transfer is flawless and looks as good as any other animated series I own.

All in all I am quite happy with this.  I am unsure if it will ever get a North American release on Bluray like Wolverine and the X-men or Spectacular Spider-man.  Both those series were produced by different studios and released under other labels.  Even if they are released these sets are more then ""worthy"".  The only reason I could see buying any future release is if you prefer the package art.

Bottom line if you like the show then this is a must buy.  If you don't mind waiting I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon.ca over here to get it at the best price.",1423008000,5,1442,4.381132075471698

5066924,5,B0079ILI6G,"This is animation gold!  I love this series and it's sad the it only lasted 2 seasons, but at least they were 2 action packed and filled to the brim seasons.  Plenty of great stories were told and a lot was covered.

Marvel doesn't fare well when comparing their animations to DC's offerings, but this one is excellent.  And of course being excellent means it had to get cancelled in favor of a lesser Avenger's animation.

I am so happy to have it on blu-ray.  For some reason, Disney has refused to release it this way, forcing people to buy countless individual dvd  volumes at a much higher price and lower quality.  I imported this blu-ray and it's fantastic.  Colors and saturation are much better and the picture is beautiful.  The DVDs look fine to because most animation is already all digital these days, but these blu-rays stand out.

As another reviewer pointed out; these blu-rays lack subtitles.  It's an odd omisison, but one I can live with to have this great animation in my collection.",1401321600,18,1003,4.636363636363637
5066925,5,B0079ILI6G,"26 episodes of the first season.  I waited on this until it came out in a full season format (hate those little collections).

With some minor caveats, it was worth the wait.  This is the best Janet and Hank I've seen in animation.  There were great villains to fight, and they certainly thought about their plots.  Cap and Hela.  Love that.  And my favorite Jane Foster version.

There were several Easter eggs I saw:

Some of the mercenaries from the original Predator movie working for Klaw.

Wild Bill from GI Joe a Hulkbuster helicopter pilot.

The Futurist - reference to RDJ's album.

Logan as a Howler.

The SHIELD hovercar and barbershop.

Had some quibbles.  Iron Man really went overboard on the arrogance, and too many things were ""his fault"".  Hulk was a bit too talkative.  And Loki really needs to wash off the mascara (yeah, I know, Frost Giant.  Still looks silly).  Sometimes continuity wasn't the best.  So, where did Janet's winter coat go?

Definite pick up if a Marvel fan.

No subtitles though.  Extra features are just some interviews, so that was quite disappointing.",1397347200,12,1092,4.783783783783784

5066955,4,B0079ILI6G,"The Avengers is a solid and fun show.

It can be enjoyed as an adult level cartoon or, depending on your tolerance for violence, for very young children.

I am tickled pink that CPT America  he was in the Army so the abbreviation should be CPT  is back as a character that is all heart and no compromises. The troubled, angst ridden CPT America that I remembered from the comic books in the 70s was just wrong.

The way the series pulls in other Marvel characters, Iron Fist, Powerman, and Spiderman, is pretty neat as well.

The one thing that disturbs me about the whole Avengers/Shield interaction is the new Nick Fury.  I remember SGT Nick Fury and his howling Commandos. I remember LTC Nick Fury Agent of Shield.  Since when did every army guy have to be a four star General or Medal of Honor winner to get the leading part in an animated story or Marvel movie?",1384473600,,866,4.40251572327044
5066956,5,B0079ILI6G,"I will admit, I love this show!  I originally found it because my 3 year old son has somehow become obsessed to the 9th degree with Ironman.  I'm talking, he says Ironman probably, easily, 30 times a day.  Ironman is my brother, Ironman is big, I want big Ironman, I want Ironman's friends, I am Ironman...etc etc..all day, all week, all month.  Anyway, since he's too young for the movies, and he doesn't like the newer cartoon with the Ironman teen, I found this and it did not disappoint!  It's done well, like a real drama for adults.  There are the rest of the Avengers, crazy back stories threaded in.  It's so freakin good.  I literally sit in suspense as I watch.  My husband calls me to come to dinner and we (the kids and I) literally ignore him and keep watching.  So, I recommend you watch and get ready to be entertained.  I admit I've always liked superheroes but I never got into the Avengers; more of a Batman, Spider-Man, and Hulk tv series girl.  So now I'm into them, thanks to this show and my adorable boy who loves Ironman!",1383004800,6,1045,4.385416666666667
5066957,4,B0079ILI6G,"As a permanent resident of Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Children, I've never been much for the 'Avengers'; however, they seem to be the current, popular fascination, and so I've availed myself to learning a little about them.  This cartoon has not been a failure in introducing me to the world of the 'Avengers'; I love the character development, as well as the broad roster of characters.  Almost every episode offers the viewer another player in the machinations of the 'Avengers' and their nemeses.  I also love the patience of the story-arcs, allowing the focus to veer away from this character or that character for one or more episodes, and give some time to the development of another element of the story.  So, for one or two episodes, the story develops Iron Man and his tense relationship with SHIELD; then, for another two episodes, we watch the development of Hawkeye and Black Widow.  This slow-paced development allows the world of the 'Avengers' to become 'three-dimensional' and autonomous, as opposed to a reflexively-generated locus for a lot of explosions.

Speaking of explosions, I have a single caveat: it seems that every episode demands an action sequence of some kind.  Given that each episode is only 20 minutes in length, squeezing character development and a big fight-scene into every single episodes renders the episodes mighty fast and pace, and you feel yourself dizzy and out of breath by the closing credits.  Giving some episodes completely to battles, and others completely to character and plot, would allow for a much more naturally-progressing story.",1371427200,5,1597,5.115384615384615

8512794,5,B0079ILI6G,This Avengers cartoon was based on the comic books. This probably was Marvel's best cartoon next to the original X-Men cartoon from the early 1990s. Too bad it only did two seasons before they wanted to replace it with Avengers Assemble which resembles the movies. This cartoon came out before the Avengers movie it was to get people ready for it and introduce them to the characters if they didn't know them already. Great stories great characters great artwork.
