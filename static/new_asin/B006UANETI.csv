So I  got her ones she can enjoy  over and over. The good ole cartoons from back in the day !!,1481760000,,255,3.7358490566037736

8504499,3,B006UANETI,"NOTE: ""EDITORIAL REVIEW"" INDICATING THAT THIS COLLECTION ONLY INCLUDED THE FIRST 14 EPISODES OF THIS SERIES WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT TIME OF PURCHASE.

The Flintstones as a series is fantastic but the if you're expecting a mix of all 6 seasons in this dvd collection, you are going to be greatly disappointed.  What you are actually getting are the first two DVDs from the first season collection--no Pebbles and Bamm Bamm episodes since Pebbles isn't born until the middle of season 3 and Bamm Bamm doesn't arrive until the beginning of season 4.  So, no, you cannot ""revisit Jurassic jokers . . . Pebbles and Bamm Bamm . . "" because they didn't exist in the series yet.

On these two discs you will receive the episodes: ""The Flintstone Flyer"", ""Hot Lips Hannigan"", ""The Swimming Pool"", ""No Help Wanted"", ""The Split Personality"", ""The Monster From the Tar Pits"", ""The Babysitters"", ""At the Races"", ""The Engagement Ring"", ""Hollyrock, Here I Come"", ""The Golf Champion"", ""The Sweepstake Ticket"", ""The Drive-In"", and ""The Prowler"".

Subtitles included in English, French, and Spanish.

Disregard the ""Special Features"" option because all it tells you is that the special features are on the ""B"" side of the 4th first season disc which, of course, does not come with this set.

This collection is good for those who just need a little ""Flintstones Fix"" but don't really care that these are basically rehashed DVDs.  Otherwise, I would suggest that you shop around.  If all you're going to get with this collection is season 1 anyway, you might as well spend an extra five bucks and purchase the ENTIRE season 1 with another seller (yes, they're out there).",1333929600,16,1649,4.881720430107527
