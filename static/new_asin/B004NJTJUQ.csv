Though this is a standalone I'd firmly say it's better as a final visit to the world portrayed in the series of the same name. There is a quick summary of the series at the beginning to get you ""up to speed"" so you understand this as a standalone.

I refer you to the review I've just written for the series as there are marked similarities between the two.

I'm not going to go into great detail here having written a detailed review for the series.

It is a pleasant watch on its own but I'd rate it only as 2-3 starts if seen on its own. For me you don't build the same rapport with the principals that you get having watched the 11 episode series.

FWIW I considered the series well worth watching and 4 star.",1391299200,,834,4.1234567901234565
