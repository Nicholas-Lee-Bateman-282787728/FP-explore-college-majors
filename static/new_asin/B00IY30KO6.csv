8646306,4,B00IY30KO6,"The Chaperone:
Triple H makes his WWE Studios debut as he plays Ray Bradstone who used to be a wheel-man for a group of bank robbers led by a man named Larue (Kevin Corrigan) but was caught & served a prison sentence where he rehabilitated himself via advice from a radio show & knowledgeable books. He gets released with the goal to leave his past behind him, including refusing to be acknowledged by his past nickname of ""Ray Ray"", & set things right with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter) & ex-wife Lynne (Annabeth Gish). After the difficulties of being an ex-con in the real world effected Ray as his family kept telling him that they've moved on while he couldn't find a job & lost everything he had in a fire, he agreed to do another job with his old crew but had a change of heart at the last minute & ditched the crew during the robbery and stowaway on his daughter's class trip to New Orleans. When the Larue & the robbers discover that Ray left them & the police chase them, one of the robbers drop the bag of money next to the school bus Ray is on by accident & it gets loaded on the bus that Ray just happens to be on making Larue think that Ray set them up to take the fall while he gets away with the money. So while Ray uses this trip to try to reconnect with his daughter, he has to deal with so many other issues such as the trip's supervisor Ms. Miller (Yeardley Smith), Larue on his tail, the police also looking for Ray assuming that he was was part of the robbery, and dealing with the kids on this trip from the ""spoiled"" Paris Hilton type to a ""brainiac"" to a prankster.

Legendary:
After being an ex-Marine & a New Orleans detective, John Cena returns to another WWE film with ""Legendary."" The movie revolves about a book-smart teenager named Calvin Chetley a.k.a. ""Cal"" (Devon Graye) who goes to high school in Oklahoma, lives with his mom Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), has a female best friend name Lulu (Madeleine Martin) who clearly has more than just ""friendship"" feelings for him which he's obivious to, and developed a friendship with an older man (Danny Glover) who looks out for him with good advice. He goes out for the wrestling team knowing the history with his brother & late-father having success in the sport, despite the fact that his mother is against it, but just has no luck at it. On the other side is Cal's brother Mike (Cena) who is a former All-American but very distant from his family, hard on his luck, and somehow keeps getting into trouble. Cal asked Mike to help train him initially & refused until Cal helped him out in court causing Mike to return the favor & train Cal leading to the brothers bonding together & Cal having better success wrestling. However they both still have to deal with issues throughout the movie like facing the issue that caused Mike to be so distant from not just Cal but his mother, Lulu & Cal's relationship evolving into something more, and Mike's past catching up to him.

Knucklehead:
Paul ""Big Show"" Wight plays Walter Kronk, a 32 year old orphan who's looks like a giant but it really just a child at heart & accidently sets fire to the kitchen in the orphanage causing thousands of dollars of damage that will result in the place being shut down in a week if they don't get the money to begin repairs. Elsewhere is a man named Eddie Sullivan (Mark Feuerstein) who's a mixed martial arts promoter who owes a heavy debt to Memphis Earl (Dennis Farina) & is trying to find a new fighter to win a tournament to get the money he needs to pay off the debt. After meeting Walter, Eddie convinces the head nun Sister Francesca (Wendy Malick) that Walter could make the money as a MMA fighter in a tournament out in New Orleans & send him off on the road, for the first time in his life, with her assistant & Walter's friend Mary (Melora Hardin) as a chaperone. From there they get attempt to build his reputation via the internet by fighting in the most unusual situations such as churches, backyard at a children's party, a bear at a carnival, and frat houses while running into issues of their own such as transportation issues, Eddie & Mary facing their past, Walter seeing this as his only opportunity to be a hero, and Memphis Earl & his fighter Redrum (Lester Speight) trying to stop them at all cost.

""Legendary"" unlike any previous WWE film in that this wasn't an action based movie as it was more focused on being a more serious family drama as Cena played more of a supporting role in his best acting effort as he showed diversity playing a guy who clearly had some emotional issues with a bad attitude in the first half of the film with the acting with everyone else was very good & the best cast put together for a WWE film to date along with the multiple stories being told throughout the film.  ""The Chaperone"" was humorous with the dialog as it was a modern day ""Kindergarten Cop"" & a good overall family comedy.  ""Knucklehead"" allowed Big Show to showcase his ""Chris Farley"" method of comedy in that he's a big softhearted guy who's just very clumsy & doesn't realise just how big he is at times leading to a lot of physical humor more than punchlines & jokes as the acting wasn't much but I was still entertained at the end of the day. In the end, I enjoyed each film for what they were designed to be & all were movies that you can just sit down with the family, watch and enjoy so this is definately worth checking out for a viewing.",1400025600,2,5432,4.4063745019920315
