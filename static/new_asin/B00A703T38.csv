5391764,3,B00A703T38,"The storylines for each of the short movies in this movie were very interesting, and trying to figure out what was actually going on was fun. Unfortunately, the scariest the movie got was a couple of jump scares. The plotlines make up for it though.",1381449600,6,249,4.555555555555555
5391765,3,B00A703T38,"But I can't give it 3-1/2. Somewhat entertaining but its like I've already seen these before. Sure the plots differ slightly
and maybe there's a twist or two but it seems to me that the Asian horror genre relies on one or two basic scare tactics.
In this case, a little can't go a long way.",1378166400,7,290,4.196428571428571
5391766,5,B00A703T38,The film must be truly awful in every way for me to not enjoy it.  Black Night was very good and I loved every minute of it.  Can't get enough of scary ghostly films and no one does them finer than the Asian directors and actors.  Highly recommend it to hardcore Asian Horror lovers!,1373846400,7,283,4.203703703703703
5391767,5,B00A703T38,"The picture quality is excellent. The first story was good enjoyed the kinky theme of girlfriend next door dies accidentally after you played with handcuffs but she is going to haunt you for it literally.
The second short story is about a woman who is able to see the people who tormented her in life, they are all dead. She goes to the psychiatrist and he digs out a memory of an imaginary creature who is maybe real or not, who kills people who make her unhappy.
The last story is about a woman who looses her memory of herself and family, she gets it all back but not they way you expect. I enjoyed all the acting, this movie does have subtitles but I did not find that distracting.",1367452800,7,685,4.276923076923077
5391768,4,B00A703T38,"Black Night is a horror anthology. In ""Next Door"", Jane returns to her boyfriend, presumably after running off on him, but finds out he's being seeing the girl next door. In ""Dark Hole"", Yuki has been suffering from the same nightmare for awhile and begins to see a young boy in a yellow outfit; she eventually visits a psychiatrist that reveals the nightmares of her past. ""The Lost Memory"" follows a young, single mother, Prang, as she believes she's being stalked by a mysterious man; she begins to see visions of her past, some that are nightmarishly vivid. Black Night is a low-budget, yet creepy and scary anthology.

""Next Door"" is a creepy story. It uses ghostly images and a closed setting (mostly in an apartment building) to create a great horror atmosphere. There are plenty of creepy scenes, and a few great jump-scares; and a disturbingly realistic death scene. The acting was great from the small cast. The pacing was fantastic as time flew by, partly due to its immersive story/scares. It is a typical ghost-vengeance story, though. (4/5)

""Dark Hole"" implements psychological terror, along with some ghost scares. Yuki, and her friends, really begin to question her sanity as she goes deeper into her past; and I liked this because it made the ending harder to predict. Aside from a few creepy scenes, its not really a consistently scary story. The ending is great, though, except for some mediocre special effects. The acting was great, as well. (3/5)

""The Lost Memory"" also focuses on a character trying to regain her memory. This story, however, packs more jump-scares than ""Dark Hole"", and has a high ""creepy"" factor. Along with the ghostly images and scares, the concept of being stalked is terrifying for anyone. The ending of this story packs an unexpected twist. The last third of the film does take the serial killer/""run and hide"" turn, though, which didn't really fit with the rest of the story. (4/5)

Overall, Dark Night is a great horror anthology to kill a night; packs plenty of scares and variety to keep you seated, especially for Asian horror fans. As of 3/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is recommended for fans of Asian horror, a rental otherwise.

Dark Night has violence and blood.",1364083200,17,2284,4.861182519280206

5391771,4,B00A703T38,"I'm too old for these now. Loved them when I was younger. Sort of an Asian ""Tales from the Crypt"". Good stories for this genre. Love lost, betrayal, redemption sort of thing. Just think of the old-school Japanese-horror. Still trying to get my ""Sadako"" fix, but just can't find it.",1434758400,2,281,4.64

5391777,5,B00A703T38,"I'm a big fan of Asian horror movies because they are original. I know the Japanese have a heavy hand on school girls in uniform type of movies, but they are still more original than most western horrors.

These 3 stories, specifically, are great. They are not overly scary, but they do catch your attention all the way to the end. The first one was my favorite.",1393027200,3,362,4.402985074626866

8547622,2,B00A703T38,"If water freaks you out then by all means watch this film that's composed of three short stories. It's not the worst or the best just good enough to keep you suspended to the end. The first story is the worst but the characters are good looking and it's refreshing to see a strong female character take charge of a situation. The second one is too tangled up in the psychosis but I guess they might want to make you feel crazy since Japanese are good at that (Go watch Dark Water now that is scary AF) As for the last story, it just dragged on until it made some emotional sense.",1491523200,,579,4.178571428571429

I think christian bale is the best actor to play the part of batman to date.

Never liked batman movies or better yet DC comics superhero movies,this move changed that.

I gave it 5 stares.",1444176000,,223,4.525
