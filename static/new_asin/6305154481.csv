7884131,5,6305154481,"I first saw this film at the Taos Film Festival in 1998.  I was already familiar with Shepard's plays and prose, and had seen him perform in most of his films.  He is one of the great American writers, with a brilliant use of language and characterization. This film paints an equally gifted portrait of Shepard that, like his writing, leaves one with questions regarding the nature of existence and, specific to the film, the nature of being a writer and actor.  There are some very amusing anecdotes (Shepard's fear of flying), excerpts from Shepard reading his prose, and interviews that give a glimpse into the mind of the writer. This is a documentary, and one with an artful eye toward its subject matter.  Even if you know very little about Shepard, you'll enjoy the film for it's own artistic insight, humor, and visuals.",989712000,9,829,4.736111111111111
