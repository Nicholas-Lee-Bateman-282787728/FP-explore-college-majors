188748,4,1572524421,"I fully agree with Mr Forsythe from London (Ontario). If like Mr Maitlin, you judge this movie with the special effects of the 1999, the movie is hokey. But the character, dedication and courage of Ulysse has never been  so well portrayed as by Kirk Douglas. Sylvana Mangano doesn't do much, but  she portrayed only too well why a man will fight 20 years to return to her  and their son. Anthony Quinn gives a fine performance as the suitor.  The  recent version with Armand Assante, while proficient in special effects,  doesn't exploit the richness of characters showned in the multi-european  film. I have seen this movie in the 1960 and again this year. It is the  same emotion and commitment. This is Homer's Odyssey. If you have not seen  this movie, get your hand on the vid&eacute;o. This is a film I would gladly buy  in VideoLaser disc or the new DVD. It is worth the money.",931478400,74,884,4.537974683544304
188749,4,1572524421,"The orginal  Homeric hero, tossed about by the Gods of Olympus as he spends 20 years from home. The overbearing suitors run their generous hostess to her limits as the son, Telemechus prepares to defend the honour  of a hero long since forgotten.  The return from the Trojan war was long  fought for ullysse and his crew. Ten long years filled with various  adventures created by the gods are told very nicely in this movie. The  special effects, which arrive in the early 60's with Jason and the  Argonaughts, though missing here should not take away from the sense of  adventure which Douglas beautifully portrays.  This should be on all young  men's list to see. Though lacking the modern star wars flair, 90 minutes of  watching a hero return to his homeland Ithiaca still can be moving.  Hokey-  i say not- fundamental hero, yes. Homer's cunning warrior king is very  nicely presented in this classic of 1955.",925776000,3,914,4.738853503184713

Every actor spoke English, and watching closely, you can see Kirk D. mouthing English words. I wonder what happened to the original movie in English ? It was called ""The Wanderings
of Ulysses"". Periodically I reread the ""Odyssey"" by Homer. I'm on the ninth reread now. This is such a classical story, that I think it might have actually occurred. Who knows,.... all those thousands of years ago. The Iliad and Odyssey are older than the bible.",1511568000,,552,4.53

189052,5,1572524421,A classic.,1440547200,,10,4.5
189053,5,1572524421,"In this fantasy-adventure based on Homer's epic poem The Odyssey, Kirk Douglas is larger than life in the title role and Silvana Mangano is spellbindingly beautiful in the dual role of Penelope/Circe. Most importantly, the story & script are compelling. The Cyclops sequence is a highlight and the F/X are surprisingly good for 1954. Moreover, the climax when Ulysses is revealed after posing as a beggar is dynamic. Sometimes it's necessary to temporarily kowtow to the arrogant in order to assess the situation and bide your time for an effective strike.

In my humble opinion this version is better than the 1997 rendition with Armand Assante, ""The Odyssey,"" because it's more streamlined, lacks the eye-rolling manifestations of the gods and it's hard to beat Douglas' imposing portrayal. However, ""The Odyssey"" is still worth checking out since the effects are more modern and there are some quality cast members and effective sequences, particularly the crew's horrific confrontation with the three-headed monster, Scylla, and the entire final act.

The movie runs 117 minutes and was shot in Italy, the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa.

I don't know if there is anyway to know about this ahead of time, but the sound and voices do not match up with the actors as they talk.

189076,4,1572524421,"The main reason for using this DVD is it has a wonderful way of depicting the women in the Odyssey.  They all are played by the same woman and therefore, all look like Odysseus' wife, Penelope--wonderful way to convey a solder's longing for home.  It also answers the age old question of many who read the Odyssey--how can he be both faithful to Penelope and yet, have relationships with other women while he is lost and far from home?  The answer, according to this film, to him they were Penelope--a way of having her there.  I think this may have been because this is an Italian produced film and they feel a connection with the Greeks and the Ancient society of the Mediterranean people.",1435017600,7,691,4.548387096774194

189127,3,1572524421,"I'm torn on this, being a Kirk Douglas fan.  This is obviously a foreign production with few US stars, except of course for the lead and chief villan Anthony Quinn both of whom turn in solid work.  This is dubbed in english, so the mouth movements often aren't in sink with the dialogue.  The story is rather selective, not all Ulysses' adventures from Homer's work are presented. This is probably because of the Special Effects budget, which refects the somewhat  pedestrian effects  we are provided.  I must say that unfortunately, Silvana Mangano seems to have overdosed on Valium while filming as she provides some eye candy but no real emotion as Penelope or as Circe the seductive Goddess.  This treatment still keeps one interested and anticipating our hero's return to take care of the pack of arrogant suiters infesting his home.  Yes, many opportunities for a crackling good feature were missed here, but there is enough meat on the bones to satisfy the serious viewer that appreciates the films' background.",1421193600,,1018,4.947058823529412

189180,5,1572524421,"There are two versions of this 1955 film available from Amazon. One is the original Italian production with English Subtitles that I downloaded to my Kindle and the other is in English for purchase. I prefer the Italian although I saw this film when I was nine in the English language dub. Kirk Douglas and Antony Quinn are dubbed into Italian in the version I purchased.

It is impossible to cover Homer's Odyssey in a movie and many a mini-series has failed, but for this one hour and forty-five minute film I still believe ""the Shakespeare of Hollywood"" Ben Hecht did the best job. The film was made by Carlo Ponti in Italy and the names are not the original Greeks, but their Roman  counterparts. The story is told in flashbacks first Penelope the Queen of Ithaca attempting to hold off her suitors and then from a ship wrecked Ulysses attempting to remember who he is. This works beautifully to keep your interest.

Somebody wrote a review stating he will wait for the restored widescreen production before seeing this movie and recommends you do not watch either of these versions. As I write this review it has been 59 years since the movie was made and if even in Italy no such copy exists.

We recently downloaded this movie for my 7 year old daughter who had just read a children's version of the Odyssey and has started to be intrigued by the Greek/Roman mythology and epic history. The movie was exactly as I remembered it. My daughter truly enjoyed it and I was glad to relive a little bit of my past. Of course, compared to today's movie technology (CGI, 3D, etc.), the special effects are clearly inferior, still not bad as newer cheesier movies.

But for mythology buffs like me, it would rate as so-so if not below average. It runs too short a time for character development and for viewers to fully understand the main plot. Ulysses is barely depicted as the clever & resourceful man that he is supposed to be, merely being shown as a loquacious smooth talking and manipulative con-man, and the all-important role of the gods in his journeys, especially Athena his patron goddess is virtually non-existent. Also, Penelope (Silvana Mangano)should have been portrayed as a woman of strong character, steadfast in her belief that Ulysses might yet return & resolute in her refusal to give in to pressure by the suitors to choose a husband among them, not as a drama queen complete w/hysterics & crying. Telemachus is merely a babbling wimp in this movie & Nausicaa unfortunately depicted as a silly air-headed brat given to childish whims & fantasies.

Many scenes have a haunting atmosphere, relevant to the events described in Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey.
Kirk Douglas presents a thoughtful representation of the Greek hero and his performance is at times passionate and convincing, as Kirk usually is.
An appearance by fellow American actor, Anthony Quinn, as a Greek suitor to Ulysses' wife, Penelope, adds further interest for the worldwide audience, I would think.
The depiction of the giant cyclops, Polyphemus, is stunning, spectacular and a little frightening, which is what Homer would have wanted; I am sure!

189279,4,1572524421,"I know this is a Korean product, but English subtitles would have made this a 5-star item for me because it includes the Italian soundtrack. I'm one who prefers subtitles in foreign films, because I like hearing the actor's real voices. The english dubbing in this stinks: sounds like they did it in someones' bathroom.

In Italian, the discussion between Penelope and the ""beggar"" is much more effective because you can hear all the subtleties the actress put into her lines as she expresses her despair. She actually has a very nice voice. In the Italian soundtrack, you also hear the breeze in the courtyard while Ulysses is saying hello to his old dog Argus. Nearly all the background atmospherics are lost in the english dub: The ocean sounds like someone swishing water in the bathtub.

You can't go wrong with this movie. I was surprised at the quality of the movie considering its age. It's an old movie so don't expect the quality of a 2009 movie. However, the quality of the movie is better than when I saw it as a child. They did a great job at restoring Ulysses. You'd be a fool to pass it up.

If the only version of THE ODYSSEY you know is the more recent made-for-television film starring Armand Asante, admittedly good, you really want to see this earlier version.  Kirk, one of the original great Hollywood stars, brings Ulysses (aka Odysseus) to life with a boisterous sense of humour Asante was lacking.  Adventurer and king, braggart and military genius, nobody has done Ulysses better than the great Kirk Douglas.

189288,4,1572524421,"According to Homer, Ulysses is king of Ithaca, and father, by his wife, Penelope, of Telemachus...

Homer portrays Ulysses as a man of outstanding wisdom, eloquence, resourcefulness, courage and endurance...

In the Iliad, Ulysses appears as the man best fitted to cope with crises in personal relations among the Greeks and his bravery and skill in fighting were demonstrated repeatedly...

Ulysses wanderings and the recovery of his house and kingdom are the central theme of our film, which also relates how he accomplishes the capture of Troy by means of the wooden horse...

The motion picture, fill in the gaps with flashbacks, describes Ulysses' wanderings between Troy and Ithaca... As a troubled man, Ulysses spends much time at the shore trying to remember his past...

He encounters Polyphemus, the Cyclops, son of Poseidon... He escapes from his cave by getting him drunk and running a ram into his eye...

Shipwrecked, his men gone, his memory lost, he is discovered by a beautiful young princess Nausicca (Rossana Podesta) who immediately falls in love with him... Ulysses defeats the champion wrestler of Phaeacia in a public exhibition, but remains distant trying to recall his past...

He then encounters the Sirens whose songs lure sailors to their death... Plugging the ears of his men with wax, he has himself tied to the mast with ropes so that he can hear their call...

Ulysses reaches the island of the enchantress Circe who casts her spell on him... Taking on the appearance of his wife Penelope, she held him captive and turned his crew into swine, but fails to keep him in her company...

After almost l0 years, Ulysses at last arrived in Ithaca, where his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, had been struggling to maintain their authority during his prolonged absence...

Kirk Douglas plays, with sensitivity, Ulysses, ""the man of many turns"" who had many opportunities of displaying his talent for ruses and deceptions; but at the same time, his courage and loyalty..

The full-figured Silvana Mangano plays a double role: Penelope, the faithful wife and Circe, the sorceress...

Anthony Quinn is the arrogant Antinous, the most persistent of Penelope's suitors, hanging around the palace with a group of vicious noblemen, trying to persuade the lovely queen that Ulysses is dead and that she should choose one of them as her next husband..

With the elements of an Italian epic adventure tale photographed in Technicolor, the film is quite entertaining in its attempts to translate episodes of Homer's Odyssey...",1168819200,16,2544,5.1012048192771084

Although the dialogue was dubbed in in English after filming; Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn's voices are used for their own parts, so you almost forget this fact while enjoying the action. Both men act up a storm and the woman who plays Penelope is sympathetic and sexy in her duel part as the witch Circe. The special effects are primitive but believable in a campy ""Batman"" style. The voice of the Cyclops is wonderful and his eye even moves in its socket! The cimamatic tension as Odysseus and his men stomp the grapes in the giant's cave is truly infectious. The color and picture quality of this Korean print is excellent and the sound is good.

So was my opinion of the original Godzilla, and Rodan, etc. Sadly, after ordering the DVD, I quickly realized that a child sees things through different eyes than does an adult. The cyclops scene was the only excitement worth noting (despite a terrible makeup job on the cyclops). The film is basicaly a big letdown. The sound and picture quality are very poor; a lot of static in the sound and a picture that sorely needs to be remastered and cleaned up. The film offers 3 language choices (English, Italian, and French) but there are no subtitle options or extras.

189295,4,1572524421,"...and that's putting it mildly! Here Kirk is playing the Greek general Ulysses who spends twenty years away from the bosom of his family, ten at the Trojan War and ten on an ill-fated voyage back to Ithaca.
Now, when I first came across my brothers watching this video, I couldn't believe my eyes that Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn were in such a cheap-looking movie! Nobody else is an actor or actress of any standing, and the production values are not up to Hollywood standards. Most distressing of all, everyone's dubbed in, including Kirk!
Once I had gotten over all these obstacles, though, I was able to enjoy the movie. Ulysses' adventures are recounted as a flashback as he recuperates from amnesia in a strange kingdom. We see him outwit the Cyclops, go mad from the siren's song, and lose all track of time while being enchanted by Circe. Intersperced with Ulysses' strivings are scenes back at Ithaca, where Penelope has all she can do to hold onto her absent husband's throne from would-be usurpers vying for her hand. A new suitor emerges from the pack, played by Anthony Quinn, and he, like Kirk, plays his role straight despite the film's other limitations. The VERY end, AFTER all the bloodshed in the banquet hall, seems to end abruptly with Kirk and Penelope talking very fast off screen about how they have to make up for lost time. That looks a little, ""We have to give the cameras back, so let's end it now.""
Still in all, ""Ulysses"" will entertain you if you let it; it did wonders for me, my brothers, and a two-year-old who wandered into the room and found the Cyclops really exciting.",1003104000,22,1610,4.6328671328671325
