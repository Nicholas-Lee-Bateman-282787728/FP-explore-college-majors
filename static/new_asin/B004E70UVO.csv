Still, I am glad that I purchased this DVD. The company sends e-mail updates regarding the package, while being shipped and they try extra hard to offer great customer service.

Very interesting background story of The Village People. They are the real stars in this movie. Valerie, Steve and Bruce failed miserably. Instead, enjoy the great music and acting by The Village People. I wish that there were a part 2 depicting the band's success after their stardom!",1509321600,,635,4.934579439252336
8426550,4,B004E70UVO,"I  liked it.  It was campy and just showing me New York City that I loved and grew up with.  The songs I liked, hell I went to this movie when it was in the theaters.  Bought the album.  Rented it recently and it just brought back memories.  This is just me.  I loved The Village People even before I knew they were gay.  But can still dream of the Construction guy David as may be being BI.  LOL But little did anyone know Bruce Jenner would become Kylin Jenner and he played a straight conservative person who wouldn't be caught dead with even gays let alone become a transsexual/Transvestite wrong person to be playing that conservative lawyer.",1504742400,,647,4.415254237288136
