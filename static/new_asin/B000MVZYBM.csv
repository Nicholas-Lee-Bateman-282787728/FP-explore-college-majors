2750597,5,B000MVZYBM,good film noir...totally entertaining with such a surprise ending...i really enjoyed seeing this movie...a good mystery to be sure...i encourage a see of this movie,1408320000,,164,5.6
2750598,5,B000MVZYBM,"A wonderful British gem of a movie. Good character actors, neat ghost story, give it a try if you've never seen it. Enjoy!",1404691200,11,122,4.3478260869565215
2750599,4,B000MVZYBM,"I was a great Arthur Askey fan going back 50 years and more. This is nostalgia for me. It was and is still played as a stage performance. It is a pretty hokey story and the film has some inconsistencies. The special effects were no hell in these days, either, but it's fun. So you suspend your judgement.",1383523200,2,304,4.258620689655173
2750600,5,B000MVZYBM,"I love British humor coupled with suspense and a well-crafted surprise ending that was shocking!  Also, I greatly enjoyed seeing the British actors of the World War II period.  However, the sound was bad for the first few minutes - after that it was fine.",1380844800,8,255,4.644444444444445
2750601,3,B000MVZYBM,"A motley group of train passengers miss their connection, and find themselves stranded at the station. Of course, it's also a dark and stormy night. If that's not bad enough, they're told by the station master that the place is haunted! It seems that years earlier, a train-wreck left many dead, leading to the GHOST TRAIN of the title. The group makes the best of it, but soon the station master falls down dead! Then, a mysterious woman arrives, followed by her brother. What is their role in all of this? The plot thickens. As serious as this may sound, this is actually a British screwball-comedy film. At least, at first. Things take a drastic, semi-suspenseful turn toward the end, leading to a fairly unexpected twist. Worth a look...",1375488000,2,741,4.751937984496124
2750602,1,B000MVZYBM,"I hoped for so much more than was delivered by this little English film.  The two ""leading"" men in this 'mystery' were apparently a comedy duo of the time.  If so..., they are probably why Vaudeville died.  I love English films from that time period, but I should have passed on this one.",1369699200,,288,4.39622641509434
2750603,5,B000MVZYBM,"This movie is one to curl up on the couch for. Great suspense. I believ3e the film is unrestored, but is great never-the-less.",1368144000,6,126,4.521739130434782
2750604,5,B000MVZYBM,"A gem of a movie. Fun, entertaining, and choked with action. Enough content here to keep you fancied, charmed, and joyful. A period piece that clearly is a departure from an aesthetic experience all to much in short supply by today's standards.",1334534400,15,244,4.833333333333333
2750605,2,B000MVZYBM,Didn't what more than 5 minutes.,1469664000,,32,4.5
2750606,2,B000MVZYBM,"It was boring, I lost interest after the first 30 min",1469577600,,53,3.909090909090909
2750607,3,B000MVZYBM,Arthur Askey is very likeable with his quick liverpudlian wit and cheeky misbehavior in this film. I'm sure he influenced the Beatles as young lads. There is a remarkable similarity in the train car adventures of this film and the playful mischief the Beatles project in A Hard Day's Night. I liked the film and found reward in watching it beyond the dated condition of the film. Askey is sure to bring forth an unstoppable smile and bursts of laughter. Askey was born in Dingle near the childhood home of Ringo Starr (Richard Starkey).,1469404800,,536,4.712765957446808
2750608,3,B000MVZYBM,In its day it was a nice formulated stage play. This version did justice to the original play.,1469318400,,94,4.277777777777778
2750609,1,B000MVZYBM,Lousy first 20-minutes. Couldn't watch the rest.,1469318400,,48,6.0
2750610,5,B000MVZYBM,I love old movies so I really enjoyed this one.,1469318400,,47,3.8
2750611,2,B000MVZYBM,Kind of silly.,1469318400,,14,4.0
2750612,4,B000MVZYBM,Kind of fun old British wartime tale.  Some good character actors/actresses in this comedy/mystery. It's not Hilarious but not bad light entertainment. Didn't see the end coming but should have expected it since it was wartime British fare.,1469318400,,240,5.315789473684211
2750613,5,B000MVZYBM,The suspense builds and builds.  The ending is believable.  it helps to know that this is set in England during World War II.,1469318400,,125,4.391304347826087
2750614,5,B000MVZYBM,just a great  story even better actors,1469318400,,38,4.428571428571429

2750618,1,B000MVZYBM,Don't waste your time,1468972800,,21,4.5
2750619,3,B000MVZYBM,"Ghost train was not too bad of a movie but you have to like British films, and there is one character who drove us crazy(a hyper entertainer) and he was just too over the top.....  The story line was pretty good though and fun to watch an old British movie....",1468972800,,260,4.2
2750620,2,B000MVZYBM,Very different - not funny.  One of the characters was quite annoying.,1468886400,,70,4.833333333333333
2750621,1,B000MVZYBM,"too slow--one of the character really overacted--but what can you expect--it is coming right out of the silent movie era where overacting was a must.
Never could finish the movie",1468800000,,178,4.966666666666667
2750622,3,B000MVZYBM,"It's a 1943 British comedy mystery based on a stage play.  There are no chills here.  Mostly a dark a very stormy night. But no ghosts.  A group of stranded train passengers must spend the night at a small station to await the next possible train.  In the first two acts, quite possibly filmdom's most irritating character, Vaudeville style comedian Jimmy (?) Gander takes center stage.  His leering, teetering comedy style is never funny.  Always irritating.  He's manic, in-your-face, and basically deserves a solid sock-in-the-puss.  All the other characters tolerate him.  So I stayed with it until the third act.  Here is got much better.  Mr Gander calms down and becomes less of a focus.  New characters arrive at the station.  And the mystery evolves to a pro-Nazi sympathizer plot who use the ghost train to disguise their ""dark night"" deliveries.  I'd give it 1 star for Acts 1 and 2.  And 3 stars for Act 3.",1468800000,5,918,4.75796178343949
2750623,3,B000MVZYBM,"Not scary.  The comedic relief became so irritating that you wanted to scream for him to shut up.  Many of the actos also protrayed their irratiation.  One would have thought that the director would have realized that this would detire from the movie but they let it keep going on,  Kind of an ""ex machina"" ending.",1468713600,,314,4.553571428571429
2750624,1,B000MVZYBM,I can watch many bad movies and still find something to enjoy. Not the case with this one...,1468627200,,92,4.166666666666667
2750625,4,B000MVZYBM,A fun light comedy during one of the more challenging times in world history.,1468627200,,77,4.571428571428571
2750626,3,B000MVZYBM,Good black and white,1468540800,,20,4.25

2750631,2,B000MVZYBM,It's ok - a little too much comedy for me.,1468540800,,42,3.3
2750632,2,B000MVZYBM,Fun WWII film but very lacking on the whole 'Ghost Train' persona.,1468540800,,66,4.583333333333333
2750633,2,B000MVZYBM,Just one word horrible,1468540800,,22,4.75
2750634,2,B000MVZYBM,Couldn't stay with it. It's a bit dated with predictable somewhat stale humor.,1468454400,,78,5.076923076923077
2750635,4,B000MVZYBM,Very funny and it had a nice plot. You can figure out who the criminals are,1468195200,,75,3.75

2750638,5,B000MVZYBM,"I had added this to my watchlist but hadn't noticed the name of the star.
How happy I was to see it was another Arthur Askey bit of silliness.
He and Stinker are always amusing in their movies.
Don't go in to this expecting anything more than light amusement, and you won't be disappointed.
For those who like light comedy from the 1940s, look for Arthur; he made a number of movies.",1467504000,3,383,4.333333333333333

2750641,2,B000MVZYBM,"I like older black and white movies - US as well as foreign, particularly English movies. This movie is really boring though and I just couldn't finish it. I had to stop watching about 1/2 way though. It just didn't hold my interest in any way.",1466812800,,244,4.326086956521739
2750642,3,B000MVZYBM,"My favorite eras for films are the 30's and 40's. Certainly not comparable to today's films as far as acting and technique.  But if comparisons to modern films can be put aside, it was enjoyable and worth watching.",1466812800,,214,4.631578947368421

2750647,5,B000MVZYBM,Interesting characters stuck in a railroad station overnight waiting for the next train. Enjoyed the antics and was surprised by the ending.,1466640000,,140,5.409090909090909
2750648,2,B000MVZYBM,Horrible.  'Comedy' it wasn't.  A Scooby-doo predecessor.  Except lacking in any entertainment.,1466553600,,95,6.75
2750649,3,B000MVZYBM,It was fun to see the corny jokes,1466553600,,33,3.25
2750650,5,B000MVZYBM,"Uniquely worth watching, altho quite dated and devoid of any known actors.  The plot was cleverly hidden until the last few minutes, showing the cleverness of the film makers. The short comic character was quite funny, and a couple of the others were credible.  Despite a hurried -up ending, I'd recommend it to any sincere film consumer.",1466121600,,338,4.912280701754386
2750651,4,B000MVZYBM,"Actually pretty interesting plot and story line. Some comedy, some suspense and couple good actors . Surprise ending.",1466121600,,117,5.555555555555555

2750653,4,B000MVZYBM,"Held my interest, no clue to ending.  Black and white vintage movies are my favorite.  Could stand remastering in order to improve sound but worth viewing",1466035200,,154,4.884615384615385
2750654,5,B000MVZYBM,I really like the way I was kept guessing.  Ending was a surprise.,1466035200,,66,4.076923076923077

2750662,4,B000MVZYBM,"First of all, I love old movies and especially the murder mysteries! This one was a hoot! The little comical guy got on my nerves, but he got on everyone's nerves! This movie is very entertaining and so much fun.",1465776000,,212,4.325
2750663,3,B000MVZYBM,"Though the movie is one that is a good mystery, one character drove me crazy (the comic relief).",1465776000,,96,4.388888888888889

2750668,3,B000MVZYBM,If you like vaudeville-you will enjoy this. A lot of vaudeville comedy routines. Too easy to guess the villians though.,1465430400,,119,5.0

2750679,2,B000MVZYBM,"I took pleasure in the setting and primary plot.  The characters were a little too one dimensional for me.  The humor fit in with the expectations of the era, but I found the primary character to be annoying.  I found myself hoping that the other characters would tie him to the ghost track.",1465171200,,291,4.452830188679245

2750692,5,B000MVZYBM,I stumbled upon this movie when it was on a cable channel a couple of years ago and immediately became a great fan.  I have watched it on Amazon multiple times.  I think it is a very entertaining movie and I admit that I truly laugh out loud watching the antics of the cast--they are such an interesting group of characters randomly thrown together at the train station.  I highly recommend!,1462320000,,391,4.47887323943662

2750696,4,B000MVZYBM,"A ""comedy-mystery"" not being the easiest thing to pull off successfully, I was a bit hesitant to give this a go - and while the lead character's restless energy and endless clowning was at first annoying (something like a fly buzzing around a room), his endearing charm soon wins one over. Between the well-paced staccato of his pranks, fresh action and the occasional humdinger of a twist, the story keep's one's interest on through to the a-ha! end.",1460332800,,451,4.794871794871795

2750711,5,B000MVZYBM,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old black & white mystery-comedy movie!!

Very quirky, and somewhat droll, but considering how and when it was made a surprisingly entertaining film! Enjoyed it, but you must also know that I love old movies. Although, for awhile at the beginning I was wondering where in the world the movie was headed, it did eventually get to more interesting bits. This is a classic British comedy-thriller.  I was VERY impressed with the mixture of drama, suspense & comedy.  This old fashioned British chiller has its moments. A great cast, good story, with humor and a bit of spooky overtones

The star this time around is Arthur Askey (abetted by Richard Murdoch) who is as unlikely a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating...but one soon warms up to him, and Askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split into two here, with Murdoch acting as the star's straight partner.

The remote single setting (the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night) provides for some wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled. Also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink.

Wonderfully atmospheric. Askey does indeed come across as over the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just as Oh, Mr Porter is for Will hay. If you like old dark house movies and trains, then this is definitely for you.  It's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare. The 'odd' band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical British wartime movie. It would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by Ealing studios .

There was a type of British comedy film which the Brits were careful never to send over to the States. I suspect it was because in their hearts they knew that some time in the future Masterpiece Theater was going to do more for America's image of Britain than Churchill, the Tudors and Noel Coward would do rolled into one. And these comedies would make Masterpiece Theater unbelievable. These were comedies that were just as brash and broad as Coward's diction was clipped and upper class. They were comedies for the working class, and in Britain that could be a bad thing as well as a good thing.

A wonderful British gem of a movie. Good character actors, neat ghost story, give it a try if you've never seen it.  The comedic lead is way over the top, but I enjoyed his antics.  A good way to spend a Sunday afternoon  Enjoy!

If this sounds interesting to you, you can check out (a fairly poor quality) copy of the movie before you buy it.

SPOILER ALERT
Mismatched travelers are stranded overnight at a lonely rural railway station.

Tommy Gander (Arthur Askey), a vaudeville comedian, pulls the communication cord on a GWR express train, bringing it to a stop so he can retrieve his hat. Returning to the train, he escapes an angry conductor by ducking into a compartment occupied by attractive blonde Jackie Winthrop (Carole Lynne), whom Gander flirts with. Another passenger, Teddy (Richard Murdoch), has his eye on Jackie as well, but her companion Richard Winthrop (Peter Murray-Hill) ejects both of them from the compartment.

When the train stops at Fal Vale Junction, Cornwall, these four get off to change trains, as do Herbert (Stuart Latham) and his fianc&eacute;e Edna (Betty Jardine), spinster Miss Bourne (Kathleen Harrison), and the tippling Dr. Sterling (Morland Graham). However, the stationmaster, Saul Hodgkin (Herbert Lomas) tells them the last Truro-bound train has gone, and that they cannot remain at the station, as he is locking up for the night. The passengers insist on staying, as it is raining heavily and the nearest village is four miles away.

Hodgkin warns them the station is haunted. A branch line once crossed the river on a swing bridge close to the station. He tells them about a phantom train which is said to travel these parts at dead of night, carrying ghosts from a long-ago train wreck in the area. A phantom train has been heard periodically on the abandoned track. It is said to kill anyone who looks upon it.  With that, he reluctantly leaves them.

As the passengers make themselves as comfortable as they can, they hear footsteps outside. Richard opens the door, and Hodgkin collapses into the room. Dr. Sterling pronounces him dead. Later, a terrified young woman in black (Linden Travers) appears. She pleads for help, saying that someone is pursuing her. A car spins off the road and crashes into a tree. The driver is unhurt, but his car is damaged. Back in the waiting room, he introduces himself as John Price (Raymond Huntley) and explains that he is searching for his sister Julia, who he says suffers from delusions. Julia protests that he is lying. Price further explains that she thought she had seen the ghost train, and became obsessed with it ever since. The passengers tell him that Hodgkin has died. When Price insists on seeing the body, they discover it has mysteriously vanished.  Price leaves to arrange transportation.

The travelers eventually get to the bottom of the things that go bump in the night. In between the scary bits, comedian Arthur Askey plays the gags with his Vaudeville style humor, to the constant irritation of his fellow passengers.

Then an approaching train is heard. As it thunders past, Julia smashes a window to look at it, then screams and faints. They hear singing from the nearby railway tunnel mouth. Julia claims that Ben Isaacs (D. J. Williams), the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back. Teddy shoots at the ""ghost"", causing it to flee back into the tunnel, leaving behind a bloodstained cloth.

Teddy shows the others the cloth and orders the others, at gunpoint, to stay put until the police arrive, but Richard punches him, knocking him out. The passengers carry him to the bus Price has obtained. When Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard, as now there will be no one to intercept the train on its return journey. When Gander remarks that he had returned the bridge to the open position, Dr. Sterling suddenly orders the bus driver to stop, while his confederate, Price, produces his own gun. Sterling orders the driver to turn back so they can warn the train.

Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the ""ghost train""; a very much alive Hodgkin flags the train off and climbs aboard. Teddy explains that the train is really being used by Nazi Fifth Columnists to secretly transport arms. While Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try to stop the train, Teddy knocks Sterling out and gains control of the situation. The train plunges into the river.",1443744000,,7239,4.782051282051282

Some movie trivia ...

 When Winthrop is introduced as an all-rounder for the MCC, this indicates that he plays for the English cricket team (the MCC was the name used by the national side for many years) and played as a batsmen and a bowler.

The doctor's quote, 'There are more things in heaven and earth ...', is from 'Hamlet' (Act 1, scene 5, line 166).

Tommy Gander's quote, 'It's a far far better thing I do ....', is from 'A Tale of Two Cities' by Charles Dickens.

Tommy Gander makes a comment about the parrot singeing its 'parson's nose'. The 'parson's nose' is a nickname for the pygostyle, the fleshy protuberance visible at the posterior end of a chicken that has been prepared for cooking. It has a swollen appearance because it also contains the uropygial gland that produces preen oil.

Due to previous work commitments having taken him around the country, Arthur Askey's first real experience of the Blitz came when he arrived in London to shoot the film, having despatched his wife and daughter to the perceived safety of Lakeside at Lake Windermere.

Director Richard Lester used the opening comedic train sequence as the inspiration for the similar sequence in A Hard Day's Night (1964).",1427155200,,1513,4.683018867924528
