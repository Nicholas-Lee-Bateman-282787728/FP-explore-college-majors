8727250,5,B013C6OPIG,"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.

Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play, or there are black lines on the side of the picture. I don't know if they got bad copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no freeze ups and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time. That is all good BUT THERE ARE black bars hard matted on the image like other reviewers mentioned. Someone at Olive done gone and messed up but my friend Ron2900 found a fix, I tell you what. I'm going to let him explain in his own words...

Boomhauer isn't always that easy to understand so we thought I should explain this. When I have a full frame 4:3 dvd I will watch it in 4:3 mode on my tv and there will be black (in my case, gray) bars or I can watch it in 16x9 or screen fit and the image stretches with no black bars. With this season the black bars will not go away in 16x9 or screen fit and when I watch it 4:3 there are black bars in addition to the gray bars on my set so the image is scrunched and the image is too tall and skinny. Someone messed up at Olive and I'm going to contact them about re-authoring these and getting replacement dvds but in the meantime...

I was able to fix the problem and view the show ""normally"" just like the previous seasons by changing the tv type setting in the menu on my Sony dvd player from 16x9 (I have a 16x9 tv set) to the 4:3 letterbox or 4:3 pan and scan setting. Once I changed the settings the hard matted black bars were gone when viewing in 4:3 and I was able to stretch the picture to fill up my tv set when viewing in 16x9. If anyone has any questions or needs help setting their player, feel free to comment or email me and I will try my best to help y'all. Back over to Boomhauer...

Yeah man, I tell ya what man, black bars are gone.

Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 22 uncut episodes of Season 12 are on three single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:

Disc One:
01 Suite Smell Of Excess
02 Bobby Rae
03 The Powder Puff Boys
04 Four Wave Intersection
05 Death Picks Cotton
06 Raise The Steaks
07 Tears Of An Inflatable Clown
08 The Minh Who Knew Too Much

Disc Two:
09 Dream Weaver
10 Doggone Crazy
11 Trans-Fascism

17 Six Characters In Search Of A House
18 The Courtship Of Joseph's Father
19 Strangeness On A Train

Video: Black bars aside, the episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The colors pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.

Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English

Extras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!",1501977600,13,3874,4.1644385026737964
