1808734,1,B00007G1ZB,"NYPD detective, Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff), investigates the mysterious death of a man hit by a subway. The condition of the corpse show signs of a contagious disease. When other victims are found looking very similar, it raises the concern of Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone), a Department of Health researcher. After her findings reveal the deaths were not caused by a virus, she teams up with Mike to try to figure out the source of these deaths. Their investigation leads them to a sinister, voyeuristic website, feardotcom.com, that shows human depravity and live murders. Apparently, the victims died 48 hours after visiting the ""fear"" site and Mike and Terry are now racing against the clock, trying to unravel the mystery, the secrets of FearDotCom before they too succumb to its curse.

I have plenty of horror films in my ever expanding DVD-BluRay collection- of all ages, across all tastes, ranging from the classics to the cult classics; from the bigger productions to the ridiculously low budget. I like most of them. Being a big fan of this under-rated genre, I can be easily entertained for hours by even the most hated of horror films - ""Exorcist 2- The Heretic"" anyone? This film, is one of the exceptions. Having recently re-watched it (after a full decade of not seeing it), not only is this worse than I remembered... it is worse than that.

Directed by William Malone (""House on Haunted Hill"" - 1999), ""FearDotCom"" has some atmosphere and an interesting premise but that is the only positives I will give it. This is, simply put, not a scary movie. Worse than that, it is not a good movie- not even close. It is sloppy, haphazardly edited and directed, badly acted, badly lit, providing no thrills, no chills, and it is boring. The story is muddy and doesn't make much sense but one of the worst things about this movie is the acting. It is horrific. When watching this, I almost became convinced the Director must have told these actors to act as badly as possible. This is the only explanation I can think of to explain such horrible, amateurish performances. Either that, or they were just collecting their big pay checks (this film apparently had a budget of $40 million which is insane considering the outcome) and couldn't give a darn about anything else. Stephen Dorff is a stiff leading man. He gave a far more compelling performance as a child in the 1987 horror movie, ""The Gate"". What happened here? Even his commercials for those fake cigarettes have more depth and charm. As wooden as he is, he is not the worst of the lot. His dullness is overshadowed by the atrocious performance of his leading lady, Natascha McElhone- current viewers may recognize her from Showtime's ""Californication"". She is unbelievably stiff and awkward, delivering her lines in mode - monotone (think Madonna in ""Body of Evidence"" or anything by Keanu Reeves). I have seen better acting in a porno. The rest of the cast does not fare any better. It is not the actors' fault that their dialogue is horribly written (""I believe death should be repulsive, so we don't grow too fond of it.""....."" How enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be... or is that fear?"") but the actors must share the blame for their subpar performances. Even the child actor, who doesn't utter much as far as dialogue is concerned, is lame and seems to be sporting an awful wig.

As a lover of the genre, I still have to admit there is not much here to recommend- even to the most undiscriminating horror film fans. The script is lazy, the scares non-existent, the characters - uninteresting and it remains boring. This was released shortly before 2002's (far more successful) ""The Ring"" - a remake of the Japanese horror hit ""Ringu"". The latter shares a similar story and despite being a bit dated, it remains an effective and spooky supernatural thriller. ""FearDotCom"" seems destined to remain forgotten and quite frankly, this is a fate it deserves. This is a bad movie and time has done nothing more than to enhance its awfulness. Skip it and watch ""The Ring"" instead.",1431043200,,4058,4.777777777777778
1808735,5,B00007G1ZB,"I know many who dislike this movie and would disagree with my vote for it entirely. I understand the fact that it lacks a lot. I am someone who feels a movie has to have a good plot and twists and if none of this syncs well then it is trash. But this movie has a odd place in my heart on its own due to when I watched it and who I watched it with, and I will explain

To be honest my father bought this movie a few years back and one day a friend wanted to watch some movies they have never seen so I grabbed this one and several others so we could relax, -get lit- to put it lightly (Which is something I rarely ever did and no longer do)

It didn't take much for me I was stoned beyond compared when we watched this, and this is more than likely why I thought this movie was so awesome at the time. I didn't think the plot was great and some of the acting was a bit under par BUT the weird video clips they played and the weird stuff that was going on while people had their odd hallucinations in the movie, made me like this movie. I like odd, dark and twisted stuff that seems to be anything but ordinary. But thats me. But I would prefer this compared to the same old horror movies with some dame in distress running down a dark alley only to fall down while being chased by a murderer, or some hormone raging teens being slaughtered in one of their moms minivans, while they make out in some vacant lot. I at least feel they tried for something different with this movie, though it wasn't extremely great all the way around and they didn't blow millions with excessive gore, explosions and etc.",1429056000,,1600,4.076190476190476

1808742,1,B00007G1ZB,"Can someone PLEASE tell Hollywood that the Internet is not scary? Except to Hollywood executives who are convinced that cat videos will kill their profits?

Sadly, at least one of those people greenlit a movie known as ""Fear Dot Com"" -- yet another movie that tries to take something from the Internet (a website) and make it scary. Not only is it not scary, but it slowly leeches the energy out of anyone who tries to watch it -- dull, slow, and constantly trying to scare its audience with something that isn't scary.

Dead bodies are popping up, all with an expression of horror and profuse bleeding from every orifice. Detective Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Department of Health worker Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) initially think that it's some kind of new ebola-like disease, but are forced to reconsider when it turns out to NOT be a disease. So what is it?

Well, it turns out to be a website called Feardotcom (actually, it's Feardotcom.com). A serial killer is luring the women to a remote warehouse so he can slowly torture them to death on a webcam -- and when someone looks at the site, they die 48 hours later. And yes, Terry and Reilly are stupid enough to visit the site, and must find the killer before the time runs out.

Technically ""Fear Dot Com"" came out before the Hollywood remake of ""The Ring,"" so presumably it was busy ripping off the original Japanese version. It has pretty much everything you expect of a ""Ring"" clone -- creepy little girl, horrible deaths, time limit, cursed website instead of a videotape -- but without the internal logic.

And it commits the cardinal sin of any horror movie: IT IS NEITHER SCARY NOR HORRIFYING.

Instead William Malone (who specializes in awful horror) just trots out every single ""cursed object"" horror movie cliche in existence. The movie just lurches along at a leaden pace, livened up only by cliched jump scares (eek! A mouse!) and dialogue so wretched that it almost becomes funny (""How enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be... or is that fear?"").

And while ""The Ring""/""Ringu"" succeeded in making a VHS tape spooky, a website is not spooky. Why? Because it can be dismissed, minimized or blocked... and if news of a cursed website got out, at least half the country would be dead within two days. They are simply replacing one medium of communication with another, and it makes no real sense.

It also has a pair of colossal morons as lead characters, who only seem to log onto FearDotCom.com because... well, that's what happened in ""The Ring."" Dorff manages to be both forgettable and irritating, and Natascha McElhone is clearly just operating on autopilot -- and Stephen Rea is just so embarrassing that you want to look away.

If you are one of the five people in the world with cyberphobia, ""Fear Dot Com"" will probably give you nightmares. The rest of the world will just wish they were watching ""The Ring."" So go watch ""The Ring.""",1367366400,,2919,4.707843137254902

Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Terry Huston of the Dept. of Health (Natascha McElhone) investigate some bizarre deaths. If you read the title to the film, you know what they all have in common. The film wasn't put together well. It should have created a mystery the audience wanted to solve and then drop clues along the way. The film attempted to do that in a haphazard fashion, but you really didn't know you were looking for something. The film really needed a star in one of the lead roles, which it didn't have.

1808761,2,B00007G1ZB,"Brief thoughts on ""FeardotCom"".

The biggest flaw with this movie is that there's two premises, and they didn't quite mesh together.  One is about a serial killer who kidnaps and tortures his victims until they asked for death, and does so while being broadcasted live on the internet; the other is a about a ghastly website called feardotcom (redundant) that has the victims kill themselves 48 hours after surfing the website.  When I was watching it, I thought the website was in relation to the serial killer's live feeds, but then it turned out it wasn't.  It was confusing as to what kind of story I'm following, since the serial killer has been underplayed for the vengeful internet killer, and even when the stories connect at the last 20 minutes, it made the rest of the movie kinda pointless.  Why does the ghost (the one that's controlling the website because apparently the internet can be filled with evil energy...yea, I don't buy that either) bother to kill the victims when all it's really doing was crying for help?  How the website was even found in the first place?  What was the purpose in the victims having nosebleed besides being a cheap horror tactic?

Speaking of cheap tactics, ""FeardotCom"" relied on the most rudimentary of horror clichs: it had a creepy little girl, the music is heavily on shrieks, the characters are doing things they were asked not to do, dark lighting amidst thunderous storms, and plenty of distorted imagery; they're obnoxiously used in spades, and they're not effectively scary.  Although this follow all the horror formalities, at least it didn't have a predictable twist ending, although the actual ending of it had no purpose.  I really wish this movie was bad in a funny way like ""The Wicker Man"", but it's really bad in a boring way.  All the actors take their roles so seriously in an inconsistent plot, which is usually the case for unintended laughs, but they're too uninteresting to emote.  The film does have one redeeming moment in how the serial killer was finished off; it looked really impressive just by the art direction.  But there's nothing else of value to be had here.",1280534400,2,2139,4.795640326975477
1808762,2,B00007G1ZB,"Not a big fan of this kind of thing (torture porn) but I thought this started off pretty interesting. The characters were interesting and the acting was pretty good, so it kept me watching. The problem is...what the hell is it? If it just stuck to the story of the guy killing girls on a website and the police trying to catch him they may have had something. But all this rubbish about the website having evil powers and one particular girl living in the computer - you lost me. It goes on way too long and too much of the time I just couldn't figure out what was going on. Thumbs down. Waste of talented actors.",1280188800,2,613,4.247863247863248
1808763,5,B00007G1ZB,"I am suprised by the ceaseless drumbeat of complaint about this film. Personally I like it a lot. The story is pretty simple, but people talk of plot holes. Whatever. I guess nobody noticed that this is the most gorgeous looking horror film in ages - probably the best genre film, visually, since Blade Runner (which drags terribly for a noir, but that's another battle). The acting is fine, tho Jeffrey Combs is hamming a bit. The industrial soundtrack is excellent. The use of the usually obnoxious Rammstein is perfect. The art deco design, and other thirties riffs (like Gesine's outfit in the elevator), are great. The lighting is just astounding. The hero dies, and there is no sentimental slop about it. The ending coda is nice and subtle. It's about torture, but not hard to watch like that J-Lo flick The Cell. If you want something to gripe about, why does the Karloff Frankenstein feature a bunch of Brits with German last names living somewhere vaguely germanic? And why is Victor called Edward? And why doesn't the monster get smart, cruel and all Byronically tortured, like in the book? Yet that film somehow manages to be pretty good anyway. As does this one. Here's hoping that its reputation improves over time, like Fire Walk With Me, Jennifer 8 and other stray cats of the cinema.

The acting is good, engaging without being over the top. Most of the supernatural horror happens toward the end of the movie, and before that it is mostly horrific torture. Sitting through this is worth it, just because of the end graphics, which are almost a perfect copy of the ghostly graphics of House on Haunted Hill, which was also directed by William Malone.

Over all, the mystery unfolds at a good pace, enough to keep you engaged without being too fast and the story is both classic and just novel enough.

A little info about the ""plot"" (term used lightly):  Four bodies are found in New York City.  All died 48 hours after logging onto a website called feardotcom.com.  The ghost of a girl named Jeannine haunts the site and kills anyone who enters it.  Jeannine died at the hands of ruthless doctor Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea).  He's a freak who abducts women, tortures them for fun, and televises everything on the web.  He's now started his murderous rampage again, but he's unaware that someone from his past seeks revenge.

Now, detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Department of Health inspector Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) become involved in the search for Pratt.  They became involved after a couple of German tourists filmed their dealings with fear.com.  Reilly signs on to the site himself to see if he can crack the case.  Now, he too only has 48 hours to solve the case.

Reilly ends up in the hospital, but Terry manages to solve the riddle of Jeannine and eventually she finds where Alistair Pratt is hiding out.  In the end, there's a big confrontation between Reilly, Terry, Alistair, and Jeannine's ghost.  Mercifully, this is where the movie ends as well.

I'm a big fan of horror movies and I enjoy suspense, but this movie is neither scary or suspenseful.  The acting is average at best, and its really hard to ""get into"" the characters, because they are so poorly developed.

The plot-gimmick in this movie is very similiar to that of THE RING. Only, in this one, instead of a black-haired little girl, it's a white-haired little girl. (Big surprise. They were really trying to make it different, right? gimmie a break.) And, this time around instead of having only SEVEN days to live in order to solve the mystery of this deaths you have only 48 hours.

Another dopey thing about this movie was how the death-look on each victim's face was similar to THE RING. The only difference was that blood poured out of the eyes.

This movie would have doen really great had it not been for these similarities/lazy gimmicks. The dialogue was alright but the plot distracted you in a way where you really didn't care for the dialogue becuase it was so close to THE RING.

Rent it, don't but it. Trust me, it's just that bad. The thing that I didn't like about this movie, besides my previous complaints, is that fact that I know it could have done better . . .but didn't. And that, folks, is the real tragedy here.",1143676800,3,1652,4.46843853820598

Stephen Dorff who plays detective Mike Reilly is a very good actor IMHO (watch him in Blade....hot!). The others are not worth mentioning which includes Stephen Rea who plays Alistair Pratt, the perverse psycho maniac who abducts and tortures his victims who pays a visit to his looney tune website. And while we are on this subject, that has got to be the oddest looking website i have ever seen in my life because websites DO NOT look like that for pete sake!! Do you expect the viewers to have no clue what a true website looks like on the internet? Movie makers who patronize viewers intellect does not make for good entertainment. We just get annoyed ...remember that next time okay?

This movie also seems to suffer from lighting problems because it is shown mostly in this dark haze throughout the whole movie ...maybe it was intentional to give that creepy affect but you can barely see some of the items due to this. I think they just turn the darn contrast down a notch or two to get that dark hue affect if you ask me. The story concept is interesting nevertheless but it is how they put it all together that is lacking....directions seems to be lost throughtout, poor acting overall and you can almost tell the lack of interest from the actors as well. Like they know this movie stinks and are only there to be paid.

I can't even call it a rip off or Ringu, because everything was screwed so badly that I found it hard to tell who the bad guys were.

As far as I can tell, the plot (Hah!) centers around a detective and a health inspector (?) investigating the deaths of a few people who all died different ways but bled out their eyes. One of them happened to have died clutching a book about the 'secrets of the internet' which led them to check the computers of all of the dead, and which then revealed that they all visited a website called [...] Shock, horror!

The detective, who must be the biggest moron on earth, also decides to take a peak... now the race for time is on. A whole other bunch of boring crap happens, and some weird ghost girl appears a lot with her ball (Why is she a little girl? Wasn't she an adult when she was killed?)just before they die. Oh, and a creepy torturing doctor who kills people over the internet is there too... Basically, this movie is a whole lot of half-baked ideas, added with a script that must have been written by a 1st form English class and served with some of the darkest, most depressing lighting ever (seriously, can these people not afford light bulbs).

The film develops slowly, especially up until the time that the Professor in the Coffee House covers the main story exposition about the nature of energy on the Internet. And however general this exposition is, the focus is on an innocent woman who is killed in a hideous fashion by a male who wants to ""personalise"" the experience of death on the Internet.

The prime  ghost evokes a solution by inviting those who discover the ""good  Doctors""  website, and invites them to play. And the games stakes are life or Death. The winner gains their life, and the Ghost has their  death uncovered, or conversely the loser loses their life, and ghost's secret remains  hidden.

The supporting cast is probably more powerful than the leads.

And the role that FEAR  plays, is that each person's ""choice"" fear, the fear that can literally scare them to death, is the one that manifests itself as the 48 hours ticks  closer.

1808865,1,B00007G1ZB,"Congratulations, fear dot com! You are the first movie that I've ever given one star to! This movie is just plain bad. Director William Malone has no sense of horror at all, so he should just stop right now and try drama or comedy. What you think is going to be a scary movie turns out to be nothing more than the filmmaker attempting to invoke fear by using cheap tricks-- dark lighting (police stations aren't that dark, come on!), boobs, and a little girl that looks like she was abducted from the movie The Village of the Damned. Not even Stephen Dorff can redeem this movie. Turn away from this awful showing of horror! If you can even call it that!

Dorff plays a detective who works in the darkest police station ever. It's always rainy and cloudy where he lives. And everyone walks around looking back and forth like a crazed hoot owl. He's trying to figure out why people keep dying of bloody eyes and noses. Is it a virus? No. As it turn out, it's a website. A website that will make any viewer die 48 hours after visiting it. Think of it as The Ring on a much smaller, crappier scale.

Avoid this movie. It's not scary. It's stupid. And everything scares me. I recently saw The Astronaut's Wife for the first time and that freaked me out more (and it's not that great of a movie either). fear dot com is slow, it sputters along helplessly and not even Stephen Dorff can play the hero and rescue this movie from the sandtrap it's stuck in.

1808868,2,B00007G1ZB,"Now the monsters are in our computers.....when will it ever stop?

This dark and confusing film is directed by William Malone, someone notorious for filming with strange lighting and alternate worlds from what normal human beings reside within. This entire film is in the dark and that includes the storyline. Viewers are asked to believe that a website that features murder, mutilations and abuse can infect their brains via the internet.....just not very plausible! But as horror films go we must believe so that we can be scarred to death, which is exactly what happens to the victims of this film. Each person who logs onto the horrible website dies in 48 hours of what they fear most in the world. Unfortunately the story does not explain itself until the very end when it is all supposed to make sense. It would have been a better film had the story been part of the movie before the ending.

Acting in this movie are Stephen Dorff, as a moody detective, and Natascha McElhorne, as a health inspector. Together these two people solve the internet ""virus"" while also getting sucked into the game. Stephen Rea is also seen as a creepy doctor and manages to be the only one with any clout. The acting is alright but I feel the actors suffer from the material they were given to work with.

1808884,3,B00007G1ZB,"Upon finishing this movie I felt extremely dissapointed.  William Malone certainly knows how to create a dark and ambient atmosphere as demonstrated in his House on Haunted Hill remake but Fear Dot Com falls short...way short.

I watched the movie again with commentary and realized that the movies downfalls weren't because of sloppy film making or incompetence but rather his intention to make the film as dark and resembling a nightmare as possible.  As we all know, many nightmares are incoherent and in capturing this vision, the story falls apart.

The performances fall by the wayside in this over the top visual journey but each actor still holds their own and its a shame they didn't have more to work with.

The story itself has amazing potential that is never quite lived up to due to the over concentration on imagery.  The characters are under developed and as the film goes on the viewer will find itself confused (and possibly having a seizure)

To sum up this movie I will say this:  It is a 95 minute art exhibit...nothing more.  Where Malone found a perfect balance of concentration on the art direction and plot development in House on Haunted Hill he fails in Fear Dot Com.  That still doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth viewing.  Fear Dot Com is so over the top and unusual you won't find anything like it on film, at least as far as art direction is concerned.

1808887,1,B00007G1ZB,"The only fear in ""Feardotcom"" is the fear you will have wondering if you can survive watching this clunker. Directed by William Malone (who made the lousy remake of ""House on Haunted Hill""), ""Feardotcom"" is a horror film so loaded with clichs; so weighed down with bad acting, a confusing script, plodding pacing, and continuity errors in the thousands that surviving the experience says something important about your mental and physical fortitude. If you do come out the other side unscathed, as I did, the most you will get out of the experience is the realization that you are a complete dunderhead for sticking with it when instinct told you to turn it off five minutes after the film started. It kills me to write such an acidic review of Malone's monstrosity only because actor Stephen Rea co-stars in it. Rea, if you aren't familiar with his acting, usually turns in excellent performances. His role as a conflicted yet sensitive forensics expert in the HBO drama ""Citizen X"" was one of the best acting gigs in the 1990s. Rea also starred in the critically acclaimed ""The Crying Game."" What he is doing in this boat anchor is a question for the ages. Maybe he needed the money. Maybe he owed a friend a favor. Maybe he went completely insane. Whatever the case, he should have passed on ""Feardotcom."" The damage to his career may well be irreparable.
I never felt as though I caught on to the plot in this film. Perhaps I am a lazy viewer who gets a little crabby when a movie doesn't reveal everything to me in an easy to understand way. Nah, that can't be it. If so, why would I watch films like ""Fando & Lis"" and ""Begotten""? Challenging films don't usually bore me. Problem is, ""Feardotcom"" isn't the sort of movie you want to find challenging. The central idea of the film involves a nasty looking website called, what else, fear.com. Anyone who signs on for a peek dies mysteriously two or so days later. Why? Apparently, the ghost of a girl named Jeannine haunts the site and kills anyone who dares log on. Why? Apparently, Jeannine died at the hands of the nefarious Alistair Pratt (Rea), a psycho who abducts, tortures, and murders women so he can televise his handiwork live on the Internet. Now Pratt is staging a new round of webcam murders, seemingly unaware the revenant of one of his former victims seeks revenge. For the record, Alistair Pratt is a real loony who likes to whisper overwrought serial killer type lingo to his victims as he prepares to slice and dice for the entertainment of his fans. Rea is a great actor, but even he fails to pull Pratt's dialogue off in a convincing manner.
Enter stage left (or right) Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Department of Health Inspector Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone). Reilly and Huston become involved in both the Pratt investigation and the website hauntings after a couple of German tourists accidentally film their experiences (and ultimate demises) with fear.com. Predictably, and after several other minor characters expire, Reilly signs on to the website in an effort to discover exactly what is going on. Start the clock, folks, because the cop only has forty-eight hours to crack the case before he ends up in a garbage bag down by the river. Sadly for Reilly, he ends up in the hospital for a time, thus leaving Huston to pick up most of the investigative duties. She discovers the secrets behind the Jeannine incident, finds the girl's corpse underwater, and eventually uncovers Alistair Pratt's secret lair. There's a big showdown between Reilly, Huston, Pratt, and the ghost of Jeannine before the credits mercifully ring down on a film that ought to find comparisons to such dreck as ""Manos, The Hands of Fate"" and ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers."" O.K., I am exaggerating; it's not as bad as those two films, but ""Feardotcom"" really ought to win some sort of award for bad filmmaking.
The movie's difficulties are just too much to overcome. First, the acting is insipid. Even Rea can't bring himself to inject a modicum of interest into his character. Dorff and McElhone resemble less human beings and more two of those wooden chiefs you used to see outside cigar shops. How can a viewer care about a film when he or she cannot care about any of the characters? Second, it's obvious Malone made his actors secondary to the special effects, a bad move here. ""Feardotcom"" is chock full of dark buildings, strobe light effects, and the sort of cheap shocks routinely employed by your local haunted house around Halloween. It's just not scary; I kept expecting the principal characters to break into an extended disco dance sequence with all those lights spinning around. Finally, the continuity errors massacre any hope the film had at success. Suspending disbelief is important in any film, but doing so here is impossible. It took several days for a hemophiliac to perish at the hands of Pratt? How did Huston find a body under all that submerged junk? Couldn't anyone in the world sign on to that website? Sigh.
The ""Feardotcom"" DVD contains loads of extras: a trailer for the film, cast and crew filmographies, a deleted scene that makes no sense whatsoever, an interview with the director, and a behind the scenes featurette. Maybe we should give it up for Malone and his ""Feardotcom"" juggernaut. How many films this bad manage to get a theatrical release in this day and age? Precious few, my friends, precious few. I think this one went in and out of the theaters so quickly it gave moviegoers whiplash. Even horror fans would do well to give this one a pass.",1081987200,16,5560,4.750775594622544

Are we truly supposed to feel pity for these spirits who were wrongfully murdered, when in fact they are murdering many more people than their initial murderers?
At any rate, the acting was terrible, even for a horror movie.  Also, I thought it was pretty lame that the movie couldn't even use [...] as the name implies.  Since the movie was relegated to use the redundant [...] shouldn't the name of this atrocious movie be ""feardotcomdotcom?""

The problem with it is an overbearing direction and script that are truly confused and can't seem to find a coherent or plausible structure. William Malone who has the awful House On Hunted Hill to his name among other average B horror films, manages to annoy instead of scare me with his fast camera shots,digital images, and grating soundtrack. And he also manages something very few directors are able to do, casting excellent actors,(Stephen Dorff, Natascha Mc Elhon and Stephen Rea) and bringing out their worst performances ever! Unexplicably they all deliver their lines in a very slow and slurry manner, and have a 'what on earth am I doing here' look throughout the film.
Well, to be fair, the film could have been far better, dealing with the 'evil'and 'soul' of the net(a subject that is interesting and can have a social,philosophical and psychological dimensions), but alas all is lost because of the mediocre direction and script.
If the minimum requirement you seek in a horror movie is to be scared or at least feel some kind of tension or shock then Fear dot com will only deliver that kind of tension and anxiety that comes from the feeling that you have just wasted a good hour and half of your life!

Using a similar plotline to The Ring but using a website instead of a video tape, Fear-Dot-Com does not have the suspense or the mystery that The Ring had.
The most notable fault is the editing, jerking from one scene to the next without proper flow, and the speed-shot flashes are too fast and too disjointed to have any impact on the viewer.  There is too much repetition in initial visits to the website, doing nothing more than adding painful minutes to this movie as padding.  The torturer-doctor is more cheesy than creepy, some of the acting is poor, and it definitely takes too long to get going.

In this, a serial killer essentially creates snuff films while internet viewers watch. Now anyone who goes to the site is doomed to die in 48 hours. Why?

1808933,3,B00007G1ZB,"The scene that crystallized ""feardotcom"" for me came when the two main characters were watching a video tape in which a kid was talking in German.  At that point I realized that this 2002 horror film was a lot more interesting when you did not understand what was being said, because then instead of trying to understand what was going on you could look at the striking visual images that infest ""feardotcom"" and make up your own horror story.  Chances are you could not do not much worse than this script, which is equal parts convoluted and confused.
As the title sort of indicates, this film is about an evil web site: if you surf the net there you die 48 hours later from your deepest fear.  This will involve being visited by a little girl in a white dress and a white ball, and when you die you will bleed from your eyes.  The last point is important because it is really the only thing that allows Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Department of Health inspector Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) to start connecting the dots.  Anyhow, I guess the Web site downloads bad karma into those who dare to visit the site, which sort of makes sense in terms of movie logic.
The Web site fear.com has shock-wave images of bloody knives, screaming lips, and such, and then a cyber babe comes along and asks you a series of interactive questions, one of which is the standard ""Do you like to watch?""  However, instead of sex, voyeuristic subscribers get to watch a psycho (Stephen Rea) basically perform an autopsy on a living woman.  What does this creep have to do with the little girl and the bouncing white balls that burst open to reveal bunches of not nice things?  Well, unless you have never seen a horror film, you should have a clue on how to connect the dots here.
Visually the film is disturbing.  This is a dark and dingy world, where apparently it always rains, which establishes the pervading mood of gloom and doom.  When the creepy Alistair is slicing and dicing people we get flashes of horrific images, although the attempt at grossing out the audience does take the Hitchcock approach in ""Psycho,"" where we think we know what we just saw, but we did not really see it.  You may well find the combination of real and implied violence to be a bit overwhelming at some point in the proceedings and I have to admit to being rather surprised this film was not rated NC-17.
The rule here for enjoying this film is quite simple: look but don't think.  That is because the more you think about it, the less ""feardotcom"" makes any sense.  It looks like a classic horror film, thanks to director William Malone and cinematographer Christian Sebatl, but they are trying to build an expressionistic castle here on water with a bit of sand in it.  I would be willing to bet that if you showed the entire film to one group of sophomore white rats (all college studies are done on sophomores or white rats, so for all intents and purposes there are no differences between the two) and just the last twenty minutes or so to another group, the latter would rate the film higher.

Many of the modern day's horror movies suffers from a very serious problem ....Clishes which means taking some successful elemnts or themes which was implemented in previous successful movies in the past and applying them again , this results in the movie being a very pale copies of the past shiny one , and unfortunately (FearDotCom) is a very clear example on the above lines .
The story focuses on a bizzare website filled with strange images of torture and death , any visitor for this site suffers a deadly bleeding to death within forty eight hours of entering the site , a local Detective (Mike played by Stephen Dorff) teams with one of the staff of Health Department (Terry played by Natascha McElmone) to solve the Mysterious deaths , the blood trail leads them to the Doctor , a strange character used to torture his victims and broadcast the whole process on the Web , and in order find the answer to their questions they have to visit the doomed site themselves , means they have only less than forty eight hours to solve the mystery and save themselves .
the main problem of the movie aside of the Clishes is the almost unexisting plot , the plot is very tiny , with a very weak building up for events , Stereotype characters which is impossible to care for, dumb characters driving themselves foolishly in the wrong situations and all the other sort of the low qualities of the cheap horror flicks(which in my opinion includes an Unnecessary usage of nudity ).
the casting was satisfying with typical performance from Dorff and McElmone , you really feel their effort to deliver a good performance but unfortunately the movie hasn't helped them , the photography needs to be mentioned here , it really was great and added some value for the movie , the director of the photography ( Christian Sebaldt ) have done a good job in capturing the haunting atmosphere required for this kind of movies , with a good use of colors and shadows and strong scenes of torture made with different techniques , the Director (William Malone who did a commentary for the DVD along with Christian Sebaldt ) tried and tried but with this kind of scripts you can't deliver anything whoever you are .
FearDotCom wasn't really that bad as many reviewers said , it has some good moments with one or two jumping moments but all of that had fade to black like their black website .",1065398400,,2495,4.608988764044944

""Do you want to hurt me?"" (I want to hurt whoever's responsible for green lighting this tripe).
""You're lying"" (Honest Injun. Don't spend your money on this).
Written & Produced by Van Damme's frequent collaborator Moshe Diamant, & Directed by William Malone, the man responsble for the gory but pointless update of the William Castle classic HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, FEAR DOT COM revolves around a serial killer who is stalking his prey through a website named, you guessed it; FEAR DOT COM. A site which combines seduction with sadism.
Early on the film provides some genuinely disturbing moments; but from there it becomes just plain boring with its flaky FX & dull, incoherant story. All FEAR DOT COM suceeds at is wasting a good cast which includes Stephen Dorff (BLADE), the attractive Natasha McElhone (RONIN) & Udo Kier (STORY OF O), Jeffery Coombs (RE-ANIMATOR) and inevitably the viewers time. Don't punish yourself like I did: this is coming from a guy who LOVES bad horror movies. FEAR DOT COM breaks the Vidiot's cardinal film viewing Commandment: ""Thou shalt not bore""; and for that the movie's negative deserves to be cast into the fiery inferno along with the master tapes of Paul ""Cheeky Darkie"" Holmes's CD. Long may the ""creative"" team beind this abomination suffer from Holmesie's painful warblings of drivel like LINEMAN & CHUNDERING IN THE SAND & may Holmesie's nose wart be bestowed upon thee liketh the black plague; for yay liketh him you possess no talent but are full to the gills with your own bloated self-importance.

1808940,2,B00007G1ZB,"It's hard to see how Fear Dot Com could be anything less than spectacular - until you actually watch it, that is.  I love the idea of this film, and there are plenty of intriguing aspects to the storyline, but unfortunately none of these inspirations is ever truly explored, and the ending is a complete mess that only spreads the questions and confusion generated by the film in all manner of confused directions.  It's akin to watching a criminal in the old days being drawn and quartered; your excitement at watching it turns to disgust and dismay once you see the mess left after the film is pulled in so many directions all at once.
Even the opening death scene is problematic.  You have this weird guy somehow standing in a subway station that is miraculously empty, only to get himself killed after seeing a creepy girl in white playing on the tracks; the guy seemed to have reached a safe spot only to jump back in front of the train for no apparent reason.  Stephen Dorff plays Mike Reilly, the lead detective in the case, and he is joined by Terry Huston from the Department of Health (Natascha McElhone) because the victim apparently began bleeding from his eyes before he was killed.  Huston's initial suspicions of an Ebola-type virus are soon disproved, yet she somehow manages to stay on the case and be treated like a bonafide detective by the whole department.  Some other people die in a similar manner, including Terry's boss, and it turns out that the only thing the victims had in common was a recent visit (exactly two days before their time of death) to a certain web site.  As all of this is going on, we see the handiwork of ""the Doctor"" and get to enjoy a few peeks at his web site; what this guy does is to torture victims online while other sickos watch, killing them only when they beg for death.  It sounds pretty cool, but it isn't; it's especially hard to be frightened of a guy who talks like Liberace having a bad hair day.  Terry begs Mike not to visit the website in question, but you can imagine how all of this plays out.  Two-thirds of the way in, the movie really falls apart; all the promising plot lines are allowed to go their own separate directions, and the ultimate confrontation is really just silly.  After all of this, we are treated to a final scene that means absolutely nothing as far as I can tell.
What really frustrated me about this film, though, is not the inferior plot.  It is the fact that the director seemingly refused to use any lighting whatsoever for any of the scenes.  I can understand the desire to make a film dark and dreary, but what we get here is ridiculous.  I was constantly peering into a dark screen simply trying to see what was happening.  No one in this movie turns on a light, and the sight of a flashlight was a joyous occasion for me; these New Yorkers don't even turn on a light when they arrive home in the middle of the night.  Autopsies are performed in the dark - it's ridiculous.  Why go to the trouble of even constructing a set if you're not going to let your audience actually see any of it?
I would be remiss if I did not mention the presence of horror icon Jeffrey Combs in this film, but I have to say his is basically a throwaway role that contributes almost nothing to the story.  The DVD does feature a deleted scene that failed to impress me, and a short featurette on the making of the film.  The featurette and the trailer can make the film sound pretty good, but it is really a major disappointment.  I should probably listen to the commentary with director William Malone just to see how he explains himself, but given the fact that this would require me to watch this movie again, I think I will pass.",1065139200,,3705,4.420588235294118

Possible, but not probable, judging by the vast ocean of negative feedback the theatrical release received.
My partner wanted to see this film and talked me into seeing it. The preview didn't look all that bad, the title amused me, and Stephen Rea happened to be in it, the talented star of The Crying Game. How bad could it be?
Astonishingly bad is the answer, and not in an ""oh, but I love bad movies"" kind of way. This is a monotonous, dull, confusing trainwreck of a film with nothing to redeem it but the occasional atmospheric camera shot. The plot has something to do with a website that contains a subliminal advertisement which triggers hallucinations of a little girl bouncing a ball. Somehow, these hallucinations lead to the characters' deaths, which didn't happen quickly enough for my liking, as none of them were particularly interesting. Even Stephen Rea fails to generate any real sense of emotion, momentum or (heavens forbid) danger, despite playing as macabre a villain as any in recent memory.
After apologizing for dragging me to it, my partner proceeded to kill the rest of our evening by fuming about what a terrible waste of film it was, and how shamelessly it ripped off The Ring, Poltergeist, Seven, etc. I can safely say I've had better evenings.

1.  *most irritating point*  The story was supposed to be set in New York, with American characters (for the most part).  If this is so, then why does half the cast speak with one form of European accent or another?
2.  Too many plot holes.  I had no clue who half the vital characters were (the Albino woman, anyone?  what was that?), and half the lead characters were completely useless (Styles).
3.  Too many inconsistencies. *A bit of a spoiler here, I guess.*  What sane parent allows their child to play in an abandoned steel mill?  And what parent of a HEMOPHILIAC child would even consider the thought for a moment?
4.  Inane dialogue.  (Not that any horror movie dialogue is necessarily good, but at least try!)  ""From soup to nuts""?  Who says that anymore?  And lines are delivered without feeling for the most part.
And these are just general complaints.  I don't have space for the specific complaints other than the major irritants I listed above.  Whether it's like The Ring or not is irrelevant -- it's simply a terrible movie.  Don't waste your time, go read a book instead.

1808957,4,B00007G1ZB,"I am a horror movie buff. I have seen most of 'em throughout the past twenty some years.  From zombies to haunted houses, I have enjoyed some, hated others.  Thus I think that in some small way I have a knack for seeing the quality of a movie (or rather lack-there-of).
In this case the movie is Fear Dot Com.  Yes a lot of people will say it is a lot like The Ring, another excellent movie of terror.  I have to say while yes it does have a lot of nuances from The Ring, it still has its own mysterious horror that would be enjoyable.
First off I like the characters.  Yes they are the usual cliche detectives and investigators in the horror movies, but the actors play their parts rather well.  I felt that the people really put their all into who they were acting out...from the detective to the psycho murderer.  The scenes from the mundane to the mysterious are executed rather well in my opinion.
Second the premise is enjoyable.  The scenes are disjointed at times, yes, but that adds to the vertigoish feeling of falling into a private hell of the murdered victim who haunts the world through the website Fear Dot Com.  As is pointed out in a few of the reviewers of this movie, some things are not understood and have to be presumed later, this is because one might even call this a William S. Burroughs kind of murder mystery/ horror.  The pieces and clues from one scene to the next are out of place like any puzzle, but they are put back together again as time rolls on and the characters move through the labyrinth maze.  By the time the movie is over, and you see how all the pieces fit together, you will be amazed and glad you saw the movie.
All in all its not a bad movie to buy or have.  If you like a good horror movie, pick it up.  It is worth its time.",1055894400,,1773,4.210059171597633
1808958,2,B00007G1ZB,"I watched Fear Dot Com a few days ago with a friend and unforunately for me, I was the one who'd paid to rent it.  The basic concept of the movie is actually pretty decent, involving a website (fear.com obviously) and people die from their own fears 48 hours after visiting it.
The problem is that the acting and screenplay are horrible.  Many times the dialogue doesn't make sense.  For example, near the beginning of the movie one line is ""well at least we have the camcorder.""  The only thing is at the time you have no clue whatsoever what the actor in question is talking about.  Evidently two of the people who visited the site and died had a camcorder and the investigators found it, but you don't realize this until later.  Throughout most of the movie, the viewer is forced to make assumptions on their own because very little is explained in the movie and the dialogue is often very haphazard and in a few cases, utterly incoherent.
All in all, the movie ends up being boring.  My friend left the room halfway through it and just went to bed.  Since I'd paid for the rental I decided I'd watch the whole thing even if I didn't care for what I was watching.  It really was not worth my money or time.  Sure, some of the imagery presented is good, but it doesn't have a halfway decent plot to back it up with.  Horror movies generally leave me with some sort of feeling or impression afterwards, but Fear Dot Com left me with nothing but the same feeling one has after watching an everyday primetime television sitcom--if even that.",1055203200,10,1540,4.444839857651245

1809017,1,B00007G1ZB,"Granted, my expectations were extremely low before viewing film director William Malone's ""Fear dot com"" due to scathing critical reviews the movie received. Much to my surprise, this horror film was even worse than I could have possibly imagined. I suppose one could start with the muddled screenplay, the mimicking of better films and directorial styles, the waste of the talented actor Stephen Dorff, and a complete disregard for viewer sensibilities. But I think what truly offended me about ""Fear dot com"" was the lack of a single original idea drenched and camoflauged with pop psychology when dealing with voyeurism and perversion.
An absolute ..... of the superior ""The Ring,"" which in turn was a remake of the Japanese cult classic ""Rungu,"" ""Fear dot com"" tells the story of a police detective (Dorff) and health inspector (Natascha McElhone) stumbling across a series of unusual deaths linked by the victims having logged on to a website. After viewing this site, unlucky Internet surfers die within 48 hours. Naturally, Dorff and McElhone log on, and then must solve the mystery within the allotted time. Throw into this mix an especially sadistic serial killer (Stephen Rea) who tortures and kills women for Internet viewing pleasure. It's doubtful ""Fear dot com"" will ever play as a double feature with ""The Yearling,"" but I suppoose anything is possible in Hollywood.
I appreciate William Malone's reverance for past horror films, noted by his interesting, if over-the-top remake of ""The House on Haunted Hill"" and the casting of old-time horror stars (Udo Kier, Jeffrey Combs, Michael Sarrazin) in supporting roles. But the world he recreates in ""Fear dot com"" is far too reminiscent of David Fincher's ""Seven."" In fact, Fincher's unique style (also seen in ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club"") has been completely stolen by Malone. Darkness of vision (and the soul) comes natural for Fincher. For Malone, it's forced and rather heavy handed.
I also do not particularly enjoy scenes (mostly insinuated) of young innocent women being kidnapped and tortured. When watching ""Fear dot com,"" I was reminded of a very old film directed by William Friedkin in 1980 called ""Cruising."" An appalling movie experience which also dealt with a serial killer, it chose to immerse itself in filth and degradation in order to prove a point to us uneducated viewers. Such arrogance offended me then, and it offends me now.
""Fear dot com"" is laughably bad. It shamelessly borrows from other films (all of them superior), producing a patchwork quilt of filmmaking laziness masquerading as high art.",1046131200,6,2586,5.130331753554502

That wouldn't have bothered me THAT much (after all, there is nothing new under the sun, is there?) except that none of the imagery is especially scary either.  Malone uses a similar technique in ""Fear"" as he did in ""House"", quick flashes of supposedly shocking, gruesome scenes.  This was very effective in ""House"", mainly because he lingered just long enough on it for you to register it in your mind.  In ""Fear"", these flashes have been cut in half, so they come so fast you have no time to figure out what you are looking at, let alone be scared by it.(Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I don't enjoy using freeze-frame to watch a movie frame by frame.)

Sorry to say this, but with the exception of ""The Ring,"" her presence seems a sign of loss of creative power in Hollywood.  (But ""The Ring"" is, well, a remake of a Japanese horror shocker ""Ringu""... not again.)
""Fear Dot Com"" is similar to the premise of this scary Noami Watts film, but the way they carry out the concept is different.  In short, ""visit an internet site FEARDOTCOM.

Detective Stephen Dorff investigates curious cases of deaths of people who supposedly watched something on the site, and Dorff himself, to crack the case, sees the site against his better judgement and his love Natascha McElhorn (""Ronin"").
OK.  The film gives sometimes very gripping, surreal images of the girl I said before, a deserted factory, and so on shot in highly stylish fashion.  However, Willaim Malone, the director of the remake of ""House of the Haunted Hill,"" fails to imbue any substance into the film.  This is partly because of the meddled script, which attempts to explain the origin (or cause) of horror, which should be left unsaid.  When Stephen Rae appears as a very suspcious character; and when the film shows him reciting uninspired lines seducing a too innocent girl, then you know this is just another B-thriller, completely throwing whatever unique or original into the gutter.

It is clear that director is fan of the horror genre, for we see the faces like Stephen Dorff (who was in vampire flick ""Blade""); Udo Kier (beside in ""Blade,"" ""Shadow of Vampire"" and ""Andy Warhol's Dracula""); and Rae himself in one Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise hit movie (you know what).

This movie was a a preety good movie, and it had alot of twists and turns. And if your over 10 years of age, it's not hard to follow. When some people are saying, ""It's confusing, and I don't get it."" This movie wasn't hard to follow. It was rather easy.
Fear dot com is about a detective (Stephen Dorff) and a public health inspector (Natascha McElhone) investigating on the deadly influence of the titular Web site, which channels the innermost fears of its visitors until they die of fright 48 hours later. They must go into the web-site ti figure out what's going on with the killing's, which all point to the web-site.
This movie had many twists and turns, which was real good. I do have some suggestions though. For example, when Nastascha woke up one morning, she had all make-up on.

It's a shame that fear dot com is so jumbled because director William Malone gives the film an incredible visual style. Malone (who also directed the much better update of House on Haunted Hill) uses his talents to create atmosphere where the script provides none. This is particularly evident in the grand finale, shot in grainy sepia tones reminiscent of old horror movies. Although the look is ancient, the special effects are quite modern and creepy.

 I found FearDotCom to be a highly stylized film, full of rich atmospheric tension, and taut horror suspense. The ingenious use of dark & grainy scenery and disturbing images was an invaluable contribution to the films interestingly original story.
 I believe in fact that director William Malone lived up to his previous House On Haunted Hill. A well crafted plot, albeit the ending is somewhat less than spectacular, definitley worhty of a look. I don't believe that any horror fan, or avid web buff will be disappointed by Malone's investigation of the darker side of the net. On the Amazon Rating Scale this film receives a 3.

1809073,1,B00007G1ZB,"No sense of danger.  No interesting characters.  No good lines.  Nothing except a lot of CGI, music-video-style images, incredibly predictable sound cues, and the bewilderment of watching a host of good actors wasting away under the twin assault of inane scripting and direction.
The concept was pretty much doomed to begin with, the frivolous nature of the internet being a poor conduit for the mystical mumbo-jumbo of the script.  That didn't stop director William Malone from making a stab at it.  But FearDotCom commits the same sin as his previous effort, The House on Haunted Hill, and to a farther extent:  Namely, too much playing with camera and lighting, and no genuine threat.  I could literally predict, to the second, when the next loud, obnoxious sound cue was coming to try to scare me.
Considering how much effort was put into the cinematography -- strictly on a photographic level, the film looks good -- one wonders at some of the glaring aesthetic gaffes.  The ""feardotcom.com"" website in the film looks like it was designed by a 17-year-old, complete with Buffy-style fonts, too much animation, and an overall cheesiness that suggested a horror spoof.  The various abodes of the characters don't offer much of a sense of character, and thanks to Malone's addiction to flashy white lights, all of the locations are flattened to a homogenous flur.  That's probably also because none of the characters, including the protagonists, was given more than 10 seconds of character development, making their death and suffering completely innocuous...and therefore not gripping at all.  This despite the game effort of the cast, which (stunningly) includes top-flight talent Stephen Rea, the terrific Natascha McElhone thrown away in a transparent role, and Stephen Dorff, who shows none of the grit he had displayed in the past, probably because of the impoverished script.  The relationship between ""Mike"" (Dorff) and ""Terry"" (McElhone) is simply laughable.  And Rea's scenes until the finale look like they were all shot in one day, so stagnant and uninteresting are they.
One of Malone's greatest follies was to repeat what Joel Schumacher's 8mm did.  In Schumacher's film, the central piece of horror -- the snuff film -- is never shown, thus rendering all efforts to investigate its origin senseless.  In FearDotCom, the ""horror"" of the film is supposed to be anchored by ""Alistair""'s torture of his victim, but since Malone never shows the more excruciating details, FearDotCom falls squarely into the category of all bark, no bite.
The script makes the same mistake as most post-'80s horror scripts, which is to confuse 'horror' with 'suspense'.  Writer Josephine Coyle, unfortunately, tried to write a detective story out of the concept.  First rule of horror:  Keep things simple.  Did The Exorcist need a whodunit plot?  Did the first Halloween need to provide a motive for knife-wielding maniac Michael Myers?  Did Night of the Living Dead waste time trying to find a scientific explanation for the zombie uprising?  Scream started the trend, and unfortunately it's rendered horror movies into ungainly whodunit stories with a little more gore.  Add that to the music-video stylings of directors like Malone, and you got vacuous ""horror"" films such as FearDotCom, 8mm, The House on Haunted Hill, and the like.
The only thing I enjoyed in this film was the ""mouse"" gag, several minutes into the film.  Hardly worth the rental price.",1042675200,4,3453,5.135957066189624

1809076,4,B00007G1ZB,"Fear Dot Com is probably the most stylish and frightening film to have debuted in 2001 that was not a sequel or a prequel.  However it got a lot of negative attention mostly due to the fact that to many critics had compared it to the movie Seven, which is another 100% one of a kind film.  Fear DOt Com is one of those films that will be nearly immpossible to duplicate and and can not be compared to anything.
Fear Dot Com starts off about Stephen Dorff searching for a serial killer known as the doctor.  This killers gig is he totrtures his victims live on one of his own disturbing websites.  However when a large number seemingly unrelated people start to die in a similar manner the link to the doctors current website and and these people seem to be the key, but how?
Fear Dot Com is not only a Suspense thriller but is something else as well.  If I was to tell you the other half of what this is than that could and would ruin the whole plot of the movie.  So instead lets just say that the past will come back to haunt thee.

It put me in such a mood for the same sort of movie as those, that I eneed up disappointed, even though I never was a huge fan of POLTERGEIST and its sequels or their particular sub-genre of horror. Yes, FEAR DOT COM delivers even less than those. This film is muddled, sometimes resembling a supernatural shockfest, sometimes a detective story, and sometimes a cyber-thriller. And those disparate elements adhere together to make a coherent whole poorly if at all. I ended up not knowing for sure just what happened in this story or just how the title web site inexorably drew its victims into their fate. What's more, it didn't make me care that much. It's not like I missed anything I'd want to view the movie again to decipher -- just that there couldn't be anything there possibly un-confounded enough to hang in for and try to take in. It seems a worthy cast is wasted herein. I particularly hoped to see Natascha McElhone do more. I remembered her mainly from THE TRUMAN SHOW, in which she was a likable character one would want to see have a role in the story's outcome, only to see the movie treat her as a throw-away character as if we weren't supposed to care about her. But she gives us little more to care about in FEAR DOT COM, nor does any of the rest of the cast. The most memorable character herein remains the eerie little one bearing an uncanny resemblance to Carol Ann or a clone thereof, lurking through this movie's confusion.

1809109,4,B00007G1ZB,"I am reading some of these reviews and I am having a Bruce Campbell moment.
""Hello, fancy pants! It's a horror/thriller film, not a John Huston drama."" Unless you were going to see Lilo & Stitch and went in the wrong theater, and were tied to the seat, you sort of knew you were going to see something that was trying to be a little ""scary"".
I know we have classics like, ""The Shining"", ""The Thing"", and ""Aliens"" and I think of Clive Barker, Dario Argento, Alfred Hitchcock, and Takashi Miike before ""SeVen"" comes to mind, but whatever. It is a horror film trying to spike your blood pressure, shine a little light on the dark voyeuristic obsessed decade we are living in, (Reality TV, aka: [BAD]), and make some money. Geeze! I liked this film, because I like horror films.  I like film, it's my business.  I think that on a technical level, it could have been a little tighter, and I don't know about the ""love"" interest part of the story, it was a bit vague and choppy, but - the attraction I could buy. Love is always an important factor in horror, but also a hard sell. I mean there is usually someone that we care about and that is why we are going into the dark house, alone... in the dark . Someone, money or a threat to our life. Something that makes it seem less STUPID. So I bought Dorff's character's motives, but the girl came off a little on the scary/desperate side, but nice underneath it all. I loved seeing the guys from the Warhol films and Re-Animator, makes my heart warm to see them always. I like Dorff as an actor - I think he did well with the part. * I do have issues with the make-up person though, not the effects person, the make-up for the talent on set. It was way too heavy on the female actors, very ""Dallas"", like the alarm goes off in the morning and you have full make-up? Hello. But - all in all - I liked the acting, and the story. You may notice I am not going to much into the story, because I don't want to ruin it for you, I am just telling you it is a fun ride, with a couple of jumps for you horror fans. As for the above review complaining about editing - and how ""SEvEN"" was better, number one, as an editor I just want to say Abel Gance! Montage was not created in the last two decades. I liked the images, I really did. Number two; they are totally two different movies, apples and oranges.  I think I would have liked everything to flow together just a bit more, but as far as a good creepy movie I was very entertained. I love the way the mood was created and how the story developed.

Actually, it would not be inaccurate to compare what he has done so far with David Fincher because the two directors have such an awesome, singular style all their own. What is unfortunate is that while Fincher was doing modern classics like Fight Club and Se7en, Malone was doing guilty pleasure B-movies. Not to knock either of Malone's movies, both were sufficiently creepy and entertaining, but they will not be remembered a decade from now by anyone but die-hard horror fans.",1030924800,,616,4.876190476190477
1809111,3,B00007G1ZB,"If you want a visual extravaganza that is genuinely scary at times, this is your movie.  If you care deeply about things like believability, reality, and plot, maybe not.  This is a great escapist film that should have been released at the beginning of the summer, not the end.
OK, the good stuff.  We've had movies before that try to visually interpret what goes on ""behind"" that screen more and more of us Internet browsers look at.  The fact that this is a horror film means the makers of the film have to add that element to it.  For this, I think the movie succeeds very well.  If you haven't figured it out from the title, this is a movie that suggests that something very nasty is happening in connection with an Internet web site.  This is not giving away too much plot.  And this is what they do very well.  From little teasings at the beginning, to taking several people through the steps of... the movie does it's job in making it appropriately creepy.
It also does a good job in supplying scares when one is not looking at a computer screen.  Also without revealing too much, there is a ghost/monster/whatever that accompanies the torment of those who fall victim to the site.  This entity is both beautiful and scary at the same time.  When it appears, it's very well done, and provides the movie's scariest moments.
There are other scary parts that start going into the problems I have with plot.  The heroine, Natascha McElhone, who looks like a younger, taller, cuter Meryl Streep, is told later in the film that she can find something she's looking for by swimming through what seems to be industrial waste water at an abandoned industrial plant.  The fact that this is a very scary undertaking and the scream payoff is big may be all that you care about, and at that level it's great.
However, this movie has been compared to ""Seven"", and the fact that there are deaths and it always seem to dark and raining are tie-ins.  But I would compare it closer to ""Dark City"", a much better sci-fi film a few years ago.  In that film, it was not only dark all the time, but there was a lack of humanity that made us not get as close to the characters as we'd like to.  In ""Seven"", also a much better film, there was the presence of Gwyneth Paltrow to bring human caring to the grisly things going on.  There is no such relief here, which is probably the look the directors wanted.
Another criticism is the complete lack of reality when it comes to police procedure.  It looks like after all the money was spent on terrific special effects, there was no more left to hire more actors.  The cast is really very small, and sometimes it seems there are only two or three police officers on an entire large metropolitan police department.
Which might explain why crime scene after crime scene doesn't contain even a bit of restraining tape, and anyone seems to be able to go to the scenes as much as they want to.  Or that the underwater scene, as scary as it was, would not have occurred in real life.  No I don't believe that a female who is not even a cop, would go to a very creepy shut down factory and swim what seems like a half a block underwater at night just because some bum told her to.  And when they finally find the bad guy, again there is no real backup, and Stephen Dorff seems to not even know the basics of prisoner procurement once he seems to have nailed him.  Perhaps this police department also lacks handcuffs.
But if things like that are not important, then catch the film.  A lot of effort was spent to create a new world, and in that sense they succeed.  I just think that with a few adjustments, they could have come up with a real classic.",1030924800,5,3673,4.396449704142012

1809113,2,B00007G1ZB,"Now here's another example of Hollywood putting all the effort into the visual effects and none into the other aspects of the movie. The film is very weak. I would recap the plot here if it was at all coherent, but if you saw the trailer you pretty much get the jist of it. I couldn't really begin to list all the problems in the film because there are so many but I'll try to give you a few. The acting is uninspired and the dialogue is weak. The plot jumps around all over the place so quickly that you find yourself wondering: How did they get here? or What lead them to this place? Many plot holes and unanswered questions. There is pretty much zero character development and it's obvious that the script was pretty much thrown together around the visuals.
The only good sides to this movie are the visuals. There are some nice visual effects that are entertaining and thought provoking but that's it.

However, she suddenly disappears and he's hit and killed by an oncoming train. Turns out 3 other people suffered similar fates within the confines of the train tunnel.
