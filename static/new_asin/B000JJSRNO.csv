8151291,5,B000JJSRNO,"This recording of the penultimate (as far as is known) opera by the first master of the opera-form- Claudio Monteverdi, is going on 40 but still stands out as the  (to me) most satisfactory. The Ponnelle - Harnoncourt team produced the three known (or alleged) operas by the first master of the genre. Yes the Scholar-brigade and others have criticized their approach but I must say after many viewings of the  three operas I find them ultimately viewable and breath-takingly beautiful. Yes I've see several ""Orfeos which were quite good; and some new versions of ""Poppea"" particularly the Bicket - Alden are more in keeping with what I think is the soul of drama (it is more of a modern drama-opera then the previous known works). However none of the more recent ""Ritorno D'Ulisse"" disc are as satisfactory to me as the old recording.
This drama is the most intimate and intense of the three Monteverdi opera. Here the long suffering Penelope (a mezzo with a restricted tessitura) is so intense that we focus on her almost entirely; beautifully done by Trudeliese Schmdt whom I did not know before or since. Every cast member performed well. Memorable was the glutton suitor Irus of Arley Reese.. The production was totally great.
To me much of the greatness lie in the scenic pieces and costumes used in this grand drama. Jean=Pierre Ponnelle was in his day the MASTER of what he did. The current Regie-theatre is totally lifeless Eurotrash as compared to this true apostle. Yes, this is an old but favorite disc that I will treasure as in the past and into the future.",1405728000,3,1571,4.750915750915751
8151292,4,B000JJSRNO,"The visuals of both the production, including the acting, and the video recording are nothing short of stunning. The audio quality is also outstanding.

Although the lip syncing is carried off the best I can imagine it could be, still I found it off putting throughout, to the point that it detracted from the overall effect.",1379894400,,325,4.803571428571429
8151293,5,B000JJSRNO,"I loved this recording. I am spoiled by blu-ray, so it was less of a sure thing knowing that the image could not be the ultimate. No, you can't miss this. It is full of treasure... including soprano Janet Perry. If you love opera and you have missed Janet Perry... I suggest you get busy. Really, you do not want to go through life without enjoying this.",1358380800,4,354,4.298507462686567
8151294,5,B000JJSRNO,"I have seen this performance many times, and a few other Ulisses available on DVD today;  and the question arises - why this one is simply unsurpassed?

It seems to me that the major problem an opera director faces today is that the audience for which these operas were written had disappeared.  Monteverdi worked for the Gonzaga family in Mantua; that court was renowned throughout Europe for its cultural endowments and artistic sophistication; it was for that family that Andrea Mantegna decorated Camera degli Sposi in Palazzo Ducale with frescos that are a major masterpiece of Italian renaissance;  it was in that family circle that the action of Castiglione's Il Cortegiano book is taking place;  it was Leonardo whom Isabella d'Este, the great-grandmother of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Claudio Monteverdi's employer, tried to employ in Mantua.

The court of that Ducal family were Monteverdi's audience - it was an environment of the refined knowledge and sophisticated opulence; but also of the power of aristocracy and religion.  The sensual desire therefore was expressed discreetly through rich allegory and ornamented understatement.  The pictures of voluptuous beautiful women were presented as pictures of Madonnas, Saints, Goddesses, Queens and Heroines of Antiquity;  time-wise, it was closer to Giorgione's ""Sleeping Venus""  than to Edouard Manet's ""Olympia"".  There was no trace yet of petit-bourgeois demand for easy, non-intellectually demanding entertainment; the destruction of Arcadia by French revolution is not yet seen even through the strongest telescope of Galileo.

With Monteverdi's Ulisse, we find ourselves in the cultural world where Tiziano's Venus of Urbino still firmly rules on Venetian Parnassus.  It is time of Bernini in Rome,  Rembrandt in Amsterdam, Rubens in Antwerp - and amazingly,  Rubens was also employed by the same Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga who patronized Monteverdi.  But since then, in 1641, Monteverdi is long in Venice and in his 70s.

Those times in La Serenissima are prosperous and wealthy; good times roll for all - aristocracy, merchants, common folks.  Yet the artistic taste is maintained by nobility - but of the Republic of Reason, and we find marvelous fusion of the most sublime virtues with  witty humorous salaciousness  of the pragmatic spirit of Venice.  The artistic environment is of the perfect harmonious union  of Apollo and Dionysus - clever, intellectual and beautiful accompanied by joyful, cheerful and sensual; yet always divine. Elegant, uplifting, high-spirited, passionate but never base, banal and vulgar.  Aretino winks at us from time to time, but it is dominated more by Castiglione.

What makes  this and other two Ponnelle's productions so unique and precious is that he transcends the atmosphere of that time to us.  He is not trying to ""translate"" the aesthetics of Monteverdi's time and audience to the modern one; he is not trying to make him ""People's Monteverdi"".  The magic is that the result is the best interpretation of this opera - and the lesson is that it is really futile and ungratifying artistically to ""translate"" the masterpiece 300+ years old to the contemporary person, presuming that this music/drama should be understood by the masses, or that a modern opera lover is ignorant of culture and history.

It seems that the director who embraces  these principles  will succeed in his mission to bring Monteverdi to a modern audience for the most satisfaction.  Innovation does not always bring improvement; why try to re-write a masterpiece?  The demand for Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rafael, Tiziano's art has not diminished by now;  those who tried to re-write them, as Duchamp and post-Dada artists, have not, to say the least, outperformed the old masters - and most of them admit that.  So why then in the world of music most modern directors try to paint Camera degli Sposi  with the spray paint from Home Depot?  The result will not be too good.

The miracle of Ponnelle is that he appears to understand that,  and this is why a perfect harmony is achieved in his productions between all elements of opera, weaved in a splendid magic carpet - musical, visual, dramatic.  Visually, he made for us a Baroque feast - Neptune appears at the horses  from Bernini's Trevi fountain, or similarly, from  Ruben's pictures of the King of the Sea ( one can be seen locally  - Neptune Calming the Tempest, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University).

Costumes of the suitors are of Louis XIII epoch, even details like soft tresses or men and their moustache and beards are exactly repeating  such  fashions from the known portraits of the King and Cardinal Richelieu.  There are marvelous jokes lurking discreetly - the three kings-suitors are made as from Adoration of the Magi, where one king is necessarily African; here this innuendo adds to the sensuality of the claim and to the general exhilaration.  The whole scene of gallant and persistent suitors wooing, persuading and slightly threatening timid Penelope is so marvelously hilarious,  exquisitely beautiful and believable.  Her attitude is  a perfect  ""vorrei e non vorrei"" - I am sure this ambiguity is exactly what made Monteverdi's audience smile, and Ponnelle makes us do the same, too.

The end of Scene IV in Act II is marked by Primaticcio's picture of Odyssey and Penelope; it is another elegant and discreet touch; the picture is of Fontainebleau School, perhaps alluding to Franois  Premier (Francic I), and his long war ordeals, including captivity by the enemy Charles V.  Yet  Franois Premier was also, like Gonzagas, a great patron of the arts, and it is he who introduced Renaissance into his medieval France, transforming its cultural and artistic development; it is under his aegis that Leonardo came to live in France from Italy, bringing Mona Lisa with him to stay in France and reside in the Louvre, whose current collection was started by this king.  There were other great artists of the time working in Fontainebleau - Benvenuto Cellini,  Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano.  Franois  Premier has also collected works of artists like Michelangelo, Tiziano, and Raphael.  Thus, it is really marvelous for the director to include Primaticcio's picture - an artist who also worked at the palace, and whose work only further whispers about the aesthetics  used for this mise-en-scne.

Singing is superb in the whole opera.  It is interesting to notice several vocal styles  in the opera.  For instance, Minerva sings in a style that at the time was called ""cantar passaggiato"" - to sing with numerous passaggi or vocalizes, as only the gods can do;  this style was regarded archaic.  Ulysses, Penelope and Irus sing in the ""cantar d'affetto"" style, which was modern, and the three suitors sound like madrigalists become operatic singers.

Finally, it should be noted that Monteverdi's authorship of the entire opera is not entirely beyond dispute.  Unlike his first opera, L'Orfeo, which was published in a printed edition subsidized by the Mantuan Court, his scores for the venetian commercial public opera houses have survived only in manuscript copies in various hands and in different version, and it was not and is not possible to establish to what extent the manuscripts represent Monteverdi's own composition.  Harnoncourt's interpretation, however, it superb.

There is a reason why this production is well-alive 30 years after its release.  Let's say that Ponnelle and Harnoncourt, together with all the participants of these unsurpassed series, created the most astonishing monument to Monteverdi's operatic work of art, and it is accessible to all wishing to see and hear it;  for the world of Baroque Opera on DVD this performance is the same as Venus of Urbino or Bernini's Trevi Fountain are to art.

A masterpiece of all times; and a must-see for Baroque opera lovers.",1285718400,11,7842,5.160983346550357
8151295,5,B000JJSRNO,"How am I dumbfounded? Let me count the ways!

1. I find myself writing the first review of this incredible DVD!

2. This performance took place in 1977! All my theatrical and musical instincts tell me that the World should not have continued spinning in the same old way, that there should have been an almost universal clamor for more such productions, for Monteverdi festivals from sea to rising sea... yet the opera companies of the USA keep grinding out 19th C sausages!

3. Most of all, I'm dumbfounded by how well this costumer's phantasmagoria works dramatically and musically. This is Monteverdi rendered as GRAND opera, even though the theater shown in the film is intimate in scale. Everything about the production is lavish, busy, and bold -- the very same qualities that make the Harnoncourt/Ponelle staging of L'Orfeo incoherent -- but here the excess becomes expressive.

4. I'm dumbfounded also by the artistry of the singers, most of whom never considered themselves ""early music"" specialists. To whom does the credit go for convincing them to sing Monteverdi as Monteverdi has to be sung? To Harnoncourt? If so, the man was more of a genius than I realized. In case I'm not being coherent, in my dumbfounded state, let me say it plainly: the singing is superb! If your TV screen is large and clear, you will notice that the sound track isn't really a direct recording of the stage performance, and the lip synch is far from perfect. This is a blessing I don't choose to reject; the sound is as fine as a studio recording session could make it, and after all, it's the music that I value most.

5. I have a minor dumbfoundification over the obvious: Monteverdi should never be cut! The scenes of the Gods a-squabbling, which other productions omit, are not only great music but essential to the meta-content of the libretto. This is truly as near as the Humanists ever got to fully recreating the world-picture of classical Greek drama. The 'totality' of this music-drama deserves to be taken seriously.

Thirty-two years old, this production, but don't hesitate! It's as fresh today as it was when first staged.

*** Update, 9-16-2011
However, it has been surpassed and supplanted, unless you are a Monteverdi enthusiast enough to own several DVDs, by two productions conducted by William Cristie, the older at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the more recent at the Teatro Real in Madrid. The latter is musically the most superb recording of any Monteverdi opera, any year any theater, I've ever heard.
