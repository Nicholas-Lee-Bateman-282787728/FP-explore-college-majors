8174771,5,B000N4SHYO,Great overview on President Ford's presidency and life.  Very under-rated President.  The man united the country after the trauma of Watergate and Vietnam.,1376870400,,155,5.695652173913044
8174772,3,B000N4SHYO,"I thought the gushiness of this work may have been a practice of the cliche ""Do not speak ill of the dead.""  However, this work seems to have been released before the President's passing.  His accomplishment as the longest living president does not come up.  Yes, the work admits that Ford was not Nixon's top choice for vice-president.  However, the work applauds Ford as head of a football team and a Yale Law alumnus, thus causing surprise to the viewer to learn that some thought of him as a light-weight, in a Dan Quayle fashion.

Bill Clinton spoke in a documentary about FDR, so I wasn't surprised to see Cheney and Bush the Father provide interviews for this work.  However, the work crosses party lines when Michigan's Governor Granholm praised Ford and Ford's daughter comes out as a Democrat.

Alexander Hamilton may have revealed too much to the press and FDR may have had a defensive relationship with them.  This work seemed to say Ford's dynamic was in-between, a sign of honesty and ""civility.""  The work does not look at his presidency in a vacuum.  It questions whether Ford's pardon of Nixon sealed his fate and whether the country would have thrived better if Ford had won the campaign against Carter.

I'm a staunch Democrat who is proud to live in Blue America.  This work did not make me want to switch parties or residences.  However, I'm learning how Ford was the president when I was born and for lack of a better term, this is making me ""nostalgic.""  I had a positive experience in learning more about this former head of state.",1184544000,2,1555,4.648351648351649
