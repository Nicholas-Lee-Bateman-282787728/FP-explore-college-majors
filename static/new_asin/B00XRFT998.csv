7192987,1,B00XRFT998,"If you're looking for a documentary on UFO phenomenon, don't buy this ""Film"". Distracting background music, repetitive use of  stock footage, computor generated pulsing lights mascarading as ""UFO"" footage, and a ridiculous foray into the history of world war II. Alien Skies is a huge waste of time and money. We feel cheated, swindled, and scammed! In other words:THIS THING IS TOTAL GARBAGE!!!",1440288000,2,395,5.26984126984127
7192988,2,B00XRFT998,"This is probably for younger people who are used to blasting music in the background when someone is trying to talk.  For myself
I will never understand what is wrong with producers that promote such stuff.  It is worthless.  Also why did they spend a quarter of the DVD on Pearl Harbor??? Had NOTHING to do with the UFO situation.  I would only recommend this to someone who likes loud music as background to drown out what is being said!  It WAS supposed to be a documentary after all.",1440115200,2,487,4.426966292134831

7192992,1,B00XRFT998,A great disappointment!  I actually only watched roughly 15 minutes.  The audio was poorly tracked; music was drowning out the narrator.  No actual footage of any kind; the narrator would speak of an incident and the video would just show a bunch of strobing or starring lights.,1475193600,,278,4.872340425531915

7193000,1,B00XRFT998,"Yeap, that was an hour that would have been spent better doing almost anything else, including staring at a wall.  I'm pretty sure the wall would have presented me with more useful information.  Terrible CGI, and the ""footage"" at the end is a complete misrepresentation, as it was not footage, it was more CGI.  Worse yet, the ""footage"" looked more like a murmurous than an alien craft.  If anything this film removed any possibility of the existence of UFOs from my mind.",1469318400,,472,4.719512195121951

7193014,2,B00XRFT998,"This is definitely a listen to video. So, play a game, do your nails, take a bath, cook, whatever. You won't miss anything. They used lots of low-quality, low-budget footage and stock footage. There are no supposed ""actual"" footage until the last ten minutes of the film when they show the footage of several people who witnessed the same thing. The actual footage lasts less than 15 seconds. The audio is louder than the moderator and at times you can't even make out what's being said. They don't do well with presenting their ""evidence"". There is one part when they covered the incident in Los Angeles back in the early 40s. However,they mentioned that it was around the time of the war with Japan. From there they take you into eight long minutes of actual war footage from the 40s of the Japan bombing in the U.S. and it side tracks with this horrible and very old footage seemingly to give you background on why things may have gone down the way it did in L.A. But, after making it through that irrelevant information about Japan, they only spend about 4 or 5 minutes actually talking about the L.A. incident! So, okay entertainment if you're bored and don't mind blowing off time, but other than that, you have to select another documentary if you're looking to make a decision about UFOs and aliens being real.",1453852800,2,1318,4.6127659574468085
7193015,1,B00XRFT998,"This is one crappy ""documentary"". I couldn't finish watching it because it just simply bored me to death. I kept waiting for the real material to begin but it just ran on and on like an extended intro. There is nothing new reported in this film nor is there any one incident discussed in detail, only speculation and a cheesy ""we might never know the truth"" type summation. Not worth buying or even watching for free I'm afraid.",1453593600,6,428,4.5

7193019,1,B00XRFT998,A miserable DUDumentary. The typical narration of UFO stories with flashes of stock photos and video. Weak graphics that do nothing. This is RUBBISH. Spend your time elsewhere watching internet advertisements as it would be better than this failed piece. The DON #moviestarweb,1451088000,7,276,5.441860465116279
7193020,1,B00XRFT998,"I really tried to watch this. Twenty minutes in and I have concluded that the narrator can't read, the writer is an 8 year old with an obsession with the last few ""documentaries"" this company has cranked out and the special effects team consists of art school dropouts. All of the crap the narrator spews is regurgitation from every other low-budget UFO/E.T. doc produced.",1450828800,3,372,4.828125

7193027,2,B00XRFT998,Nothing new!,1446336000,,12,5.5
7193028,1,B00XRFT998,This is a really cheaply made exploitation video of UFO sightings with nothing to offer but repeats of old rehashed material and some really terrible CGI [although that's an exaggeration to call it that] that had nothing to do with the sightings being described]. They even have a 15 minute sequence of world war two news reels to kill time while a man with a British accent drones on throughout the entire mess. I turned it off midway to write this review in disgust.,1446249600,2,468,4.583333333333333
7193029,1,B00XRFT998,"When the video begins by saying, ""You may not want to believe, but after watching this video, you WILL.""  Yeah.  You should know what you're in for.  This documentary is truly awful.  From the new age music that's so loud it drowns out the narration to the long gaps with no narration where you simply watch stock Particle Illusion emitters spewing glowing particles all over the screen, it's difficult to find any redeeming value here.  The content is rehashed from countless other (better produced) UFO documentaries.  I watched this for free on Prime.  For free, it's not worth it.  If you're even remotely thinking of paying for this, think twice.",1446163200,3,651,4.8545454545454545
7193030,1,B00XRFT998,"This should not get any star. The only UFOs were blurred spotlights, a loud synthesizer type of music played while a man narrated the video in a subdued voice. I could not see or hear anything. It should not even be available on Amazon because it is not worth the time to try to watch it and then be frustrated.",1445558400,,311,4.2

7193032,3,B00XRFT998,"It is emotionally and intellectually shattering to be a witness!  A paradigm shift in understanding occurs in the witness.  I have known something extraordinary has happened to me from four years old on.  I don't know what they are or where they come from unlike some witnesses like Billy Meir who is adamant, his visitors come from Pleiades, have names and have shown him outer space in their vehicles.  Seeing them makes one different from the majority of people surrounding us.  In a sense we came outsiders ourselves when being contacted.  We KNOW they are here, but none dares enter our world of understanding, because challenging them makes them take an oppositional stand against us.  Ergo, I along with many others I won't discuss it with a lot of people.  Something is going to happen of that I am sure.  Human beings are fearful and lack trust for anything they don't understand.  If, people like in the movie, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" act aggressively and hostile we will not win!  None of us know what they ultimately intend???  Angels, Demons or both we have yet to learn!  God Help US!",1444348800,,1106,4.697916666666667
7193033,1,B00XRFT998,"This is the worst I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  The production had the overtone of someone trying to hypnotize you through melodic music and  pulsating images.  I divorced myself from it when old WW2 film clips were used over and over to set the foundation for the battle over LA.  Actual photographs of the object caught in the searchlights were not used.  I just cannot find adequate words to express the waste of time it was, and will be for others, in watching this phony production.  UGH...",1444262400,2,511,4.622222222222222
