8215802,5,B0002VG5QK,"Great Videos! I was skeptical at first due to the price, but after watching these with my 10 yr. old son the first time, I knew it was worth it. He is in his last season of non-checking hockey (Squirts) and he is preparing for checking in Pee-wees next season. He was amazed at all of the techniques that are leagal and effective. He started using the stick checking techniques on defense at the end of the season and his game was instantly better. None of the opposing offensive players were able to just skate around him. He chose great positions and angles to shut them down. I believe this was a critical learning tool for this age group, oh and I learned a bunch as well.
