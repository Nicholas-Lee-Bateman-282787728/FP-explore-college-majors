8421826,4,B004BA9JTI,"Space Patrol was one of the great science fiction shows of early 50s TV.  Broadcast live and recorded on film, the episodes showcased imaginative writing, spirited acting and inventive effects.  Ed Kemmer, who played  Commander Corry, was himself a World War II flying ace, having piloted a  P-51 Mustang on many missions and was shot down behind enemy lines -- so he  makes a very convincing hero!  The commercials on the show are equally  delightful, hawking Space Patrol premiums that are prized collectors items  today.  All in all, a thoroughly charming and endearing show.",931824000,10,578,5.0638297872340425
