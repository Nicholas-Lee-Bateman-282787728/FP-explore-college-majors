It's brilliant. Be sure to head over to Robert's Anime Corner Store.

They carry it and their service, packaging and care for customers is second to none.",1434412800,3,449,5.414285714285715
8679988,5,B00NT6RHGW,"If you like over the top mecha animes that don't take themselves seriously, then you will love Gurren Lagann.  Every episode feels fun and exciting, and truly separates itself from similar animes.  Gurren Lagann takes place in the distant future, and mankind has regressed to living underground, but that's only until our two heroes decide to challenge that belief.  Now, I understand that this set is very expensive, but it's also a limited edition, and looks super slick and nice.  Amazon doesn't carry this edition, but you can find it at Rightstuff.com right now, but I'm sure it will be gone soon.

I just wanted to add that I'm a little disappointed in the packaging.  Although this series is great, the packaging is very thin in person compared to the image on Amazon.  I was expecting the packaging to be a little thicker and streadier, but it's very thin and not very strong.

Contains episodes 1-5 plus a double-sided poster and a 16-page booklet featuring creator interviews and an illustration gallery!

Special Features: Textless Opening and Ending, Episode 5 Preview (On-Air Version).

Spoken Languages: English, Japanese, English subtitles.",1415318400,3,1155,5.095744680851064
