8223376,4,B000WGZGWO,"I love Larry The Cable Guy, heck, who doesn't... being Australian I never got see any of the Red Neck Blue Color stuff... and I thought this might have been a best of, or bit's from that tour, but it is nothing of the sort.

The front cover of this DVD shows CURRANT images of Jeff, Larry & Ron. However, the 3 performances here are late 1980's, early 90's, possibly when they first started stand up. And something to note, it is PRE-Larry The Cable Guy!! If you did not know, Larry The Cable Guy is actually a character played by Dan Whitney, thats his actual name... and this is a pre Larry days performance where he is almost unrecognizable from what we know him as today. Here he kind of looks like a young Colm Meaney crossed with Joey from Full House.

However, even tho these are old performances of these guys, i'm not here to complain about it, cause all 3 of them even in the young days are still pretty darn funny.

The DVD cover may lead you to believe there is only 3 comedians on this DVD. There is a whole heap.

Jeff Foxworthy
Dan Whitney (now known as Larry The Cable Guy)
Ron White
Jerry Dye
Steve Ferett
Time Wilson
John Bowman
Mark Jack Wilks
Leslie Norris
Blake Clark
David Orien
Grant Turner

I myself had not heard of any of these other guys apart from the 3 I've mentioned already, except for Blake Clark, everyone knows him from a lot of Adam Sandler Movies like 50 First dates as the father and his appearances on Home Improvement as Harry, the guy who owned the hardware store. Anyway, him, he starts off slow, but he's pretty funny by the end of his act.

Grant Turner, I have never heard of him, but after seeing this, he was the funniest on this whole disc, they saved the best for last and i'm going to be looking for more of his stuff in future, sometimes the simplest comedy is the best.

Overall, if this was a more expensive DVD, I would be complaining, however, for the couple of measly bucks, it's worth it for a good laugh.

My only con to say here is it doesn't run long enough, it only run's for about an hour and it's censored with *bleeps* There is no bonus content at all... no subtitles, no nothing, just play all, and choose a comedian/chapter selection.

As I said, for the measly amount of pocket change they want for this, it's a good deal, guaranteed to make anyone laugh at most of the acts on this DVD, I only found about 1 act I didn't enjoy cause his country song needed to be funny, not serious with a one liner between versus.

At the end of this DVD it says keep a look out for a second one of these things coming soon... I gotta feeling they will probably release a few of these, then slap them all together as a box set. Usually I'd say wait for the box set as it will most likely be cheaper, but in this case it's chicken feed, so Git-R-Purchased",1208131200,,2805,4.235955056179775

Their humor is certainly 'across cultures' - guess it doesn't matter where you live, funny is funny!  Thanks, guys.",1204761600,,264,4.717391304347826
8223378,4,B000WGZGWO,I bought this DVD to see one of Larry the Cable Guy's earlier performances.  It is very funny.  I recommend you watch this and see for yourself.,1202169600,,144,4.296296296296297
