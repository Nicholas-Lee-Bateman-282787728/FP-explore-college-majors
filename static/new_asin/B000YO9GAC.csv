3033584,2,B000YO9GAC,"I expected much more than what it portrayed. It was just a scripted narration of the seasons wins losses and autos. Most were bits and pieces personal film, and in some situations they would reuse a clip. Would not recommend.",1391299200,6,225,4.65
3033585,5,B000YO9GAC,"Title is a little misleading since it covers only international Grand Prix and Sports Prototype championships.  However I loved it since that is exactly what I wanted.  The only possible criticism is that it is so crammed full of information and moves along so fast that you sometimes have to be ready with the backup button to take it all in.  But I thought it was terrific, a documentary account of the ""golden age"" of international racing.",1382313600,6,442,4.714285714285714
3033586,5,B000YO9GAC,Better presentation  than the companion 60's dvd. The comparison of tracks still raced with those here is mind boggling particularly as to widths and safety provisions as is the car handling. I would like to see more of Duke's dvds.,1293926400,4,232,4.8

8233541,4,B000YO9GAC,I was just a young kid during this era of racing. My dad and his friends were racing fans and so was I. I knew a lot about the drivers and cars of this era because of them. This DVD has lots of video of both the cars and the drivers but not a lot of racing though it does include some snippets of racing action. Overall I really like this DVD.,1485129600,,343,3.7777777777777777
