Now we`re getting deep here for a WIP flick, so stay close and try to keep up, OK? This film is a bit edgier than the other Switchblade Pictures I`ve reviewed, and it`s not terrible to endure, even enjoyable if you`re a fan - if not, what the hell are you doing here reading my review? The lead actress can act (within reason) and the other inmates aren`t as hideous as those in Roger Corman`s releases from the 70`s, but a WIP flick is a WIP flick, no more, no less. Some less painful than others (again, read my reviews) and this is one of them. If you`re in the choir, let`s run through it one more time, from the top.",1266624000,3,909,4.290697674418604
