2816275,1,B000PDZIX6,"I have been desperate to learn how to ""jam"" in the kitchen while balancing my crazy schedule.  I listened to everyone about Rachel Ray and bought several of her books, and DVD hoping for something to sink my teeth in.  I blame myself because my ""type A personality inspired me to buy several of the dvd SETS, and numerous books- at the same time.  So now I am stuck with this mess, and refuse to waste my time opening some of them.  [Hey- I could have passed them on as Christmas gifts.. a missed opportunity] Anyway, the menus are lousy and didn't excite my taste buds.  Maybe she is good on the Food Network; however, thats free... save your money and skip over her collection if you want REAL meals.

I did find a more realistic 30 min or less recipe book: ""The Busy Family Cookbook"" by Taste of Home.  I made the aloha chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, one dish with veggies, and much more with great success.  This book was worth much more than the $10 I paid for it.  Its saved me money and time because the dishes are inexpensive and the items are handy.",1230595200,2,1059,4.33502538071066
2816276,5,B000PDZIX6,"it seems like to me Rachael Ray is a top cooking expert. I have read most of her cookbooks, watched many episodes on the Food Network. Her talk show is excellent and she will continue with her success. She has made cooking a great name for the ones who don't want to spend all the time in the kitchen. Short cut is her middle name. I would love to have rachael visit with me about life, cook for me and take me to all those places known for the great food and only with $40.00 .  I love it when she says EVOO.",1224979200,,509,3.941747572815534

8190622,1,B000PDZIX6,"I won't even write a long review.  It is just a waste of time.  The video is boring and I lost interest midway through it.  The sad thing is that I ordered many of her DVD's at once.  So now I am stuck with them... Or maybe I can re-wrap - what do you think? LOL.

I ended up buying tons of straight cookbooks after this lousy experience. Her cooking tips and suggestions are not that helpful.  The recipes are not practical and its just a hot mess altogether.  Don't waste your time or money like I did.... RUN AWAY FAST!!!!!",1242345600,7,526,4.148514851485149

8190624,1,B000PDZIX6,"Are you kidding me, thirty minute meals?  Don't get me wrong, a person can make a meal in thirty minutes regardless if it is a frozen dinner or a tuna fish sandwich it can happen.  Evidently, Rachael Ray's concept of thirty minute meals is asinine.  The reason this declaration is being made is quite simplistic, if a person knows how to cook, they would know that the ""ruses"" Rachael Ray uses to cook are drivel and tomfoolery.  I am man enough to admit I have watched enough of her shows to witness her charades and daft mannerisms.

For instance:

- Water takes longer than five minutes to boil.  I don't care what type of pot is used.

- Raw potatoes do not completely cook in five minutes.  Then cool down enough in another five to make salad.

- Pasta does not cook in two minutes.

- Why dry pasta off with a cloth dish towel?

- It isn't possible to cut a head of celery, two peppers and an onion over a commercial break.

- When you prep all your salads in advance that should factor into the thirty minutes.

- The dishes Rachael Ray makes aren't always cost friendly.  Things like real crab, lamb chops, fresh fish, rib eye/strip steak and gourmet cheese are just some of the ""cost friendly"" items Rachael uses in her meals.

- Extra virgin olive oil (or as she calls it E.V.O.O.) doesn't taste good with everything.  For example, she fried a rib eye steak in E.V.O.O. once, blasphemy.

- She states most of her foods are ""figure friendly"", yet 95% of her food is fried in olive oil.

- Just about everything she cooks and or fries she burns, badly.

This isn't including her mind numbing phrases like:

-  ""Yummo""

-  ""Quick thinking Lincoln""

-  ""Let these guys hang out"" when speaking about the food she is cooking.

- ""Potato overboard"" this is when any food item falls out of a pot or on to the floor she will state the ""food item"" then say ""overboard"" after it.  In this case it was a potato.

- ""Delish"" a shorten version of delicious, because it takes too long to say ""delicious"".

- ""You'll be a rock star with this dish""

Rachael Ray is a testament that the American Dream is still alive.  She started out doing food shows in local grocery stores and was discovered.  She had no culinary training, so she really is the ""every person's"" chief.  In all honesty, it is cool that she made that huge leap from a small town girl to a celebrity cook. I think the reason that she is so popular is because she is so silly and seems like a normal person.  Whatever, that's fine.  My only purpose here is to say that if a person had all the ""professional"" equipment and the luxury of television editing (under the assumption all of her ingredients could be afforded) then they too could make thirty minute meals.

DUMMO!!!!!",1232496000,15,2734,4.396
