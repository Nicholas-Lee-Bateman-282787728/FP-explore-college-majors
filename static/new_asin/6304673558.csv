7875326,1,6304673558,"These videos are much dated and did not appeal to me at all even though I have an engineering background. I only watched two tapes (moon landing and challenger) and couldn't stand it anymore. For the moon landing, the narratives were extremely boring, few and uninformative. The pictures were ok, but not worth much without good narration, I found. Challenger tape was more recent but even more boring. For the first 20 minutes all you see is astronauts dressing up in real-time. Then you see the shuttle take off and explode for 1 minute. The last 40 minutes or so present you with an official investigative report produced by NASA which contains so many details that you are bound to fall asleep.",978998400,,698,4.729508196721311
