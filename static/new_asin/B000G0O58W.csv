8128199,4,B000G0O58W,"Made in 2004 and released in 2006, The Lonely Ones is an ultra-low budget cabin-in-the-woods slasher flick chronicling the adventures of nine college studentsfive girls and four guyswho vacation in a big modern cabin in Arizona owned by the family of one of the girls. Havoc ensues when they discover they're the prey of a few strange people lurking in the woods or, perhaps, THINGS.

This is the kind of micro-budget flick that rises above its limitations and offers something truly worthwhile. It only cost $100,000 to make and most of that went into lodging & catering for the cast and crew in the middle of nowhere. For the most part, the first 36 minutes are weak with all the characteristics of no-budget faredubious sound, bad lighting, fuzzy cinematography from handheld digital cams, etc. But at the 36-minute mark things spark into motion till the end with numerous effective, moving or thrilling sequences. Ill be honest with you, I was about to give-up on the movie because of its shortcomings in the first act, but Im glad I stayed with it because it just totally turned everything around for a pretty potent backwoods monster movie. Despite the presence of no less than a dozen characters (featuring a pretty diverse cast) and a non-budget, director/writer David Michael Quiroz Jr. was able to flesh out the characters with a well-crafted and original script. On top of this, theres a varied score thats pretty effective, even though one long sequence in the second act drones on with the eerie piano. Speaking of the piano, one part is reminiscent of Savatages Storm, which is good in my book. The score also includes some moving acoustic guitar pieces.

Of the five girls, they're all pretty average-looking (not ugly, just average) with the exception of petite cutie Devanny Pinn as Tifa, whos a unique-looking semi-hottie.

BOTTOM LINE: The Lonely Ones really surprised me; its a gem in a sea of micro-budget dreck. But you won't be able to appreciate it unless you can adapt to its no-budget style, which I was fully able to do after the first act (I also went back and re-watched the first act whereupon discovering that its actually a solid set-up for the rest of the movie). Once the second act started I was gripped to the end and very impressed by the proceedings despite the movies obvious limitations. This would be a great movie if it were redone with a decent budget. The director/writer shouldve gone on to better things but, as of this writing, he hasn't directed anything since 2009, and that was a TV episode. Thats a shame because The Lonely Ones shows that hes got the talent to create greatness. He just needs the funds to back up his creativity.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Greer, Arizona.

8128200,2,B000G0O58W,"Cabin in the woods. Cue spinner and we get...ghouls! That is a little different. This is a low budget indie production that takes a decent idea and kills it. It suffers from most of the problems of low budgets. Bad acting and bad dialogue. One scene the dead girl moves her eyes, in another the camera lens was either dirty or had a glare in the middle of it. The soundtrack was lame and with sour notes. In the opening scene Little Tarantino experimented with a top/bottom split scene, which worked half-well, but they never did that gain.

The action doesn't take too long to happen. The gang gets to the cabin and before they have time to play truth or dare, strip poker, or shower, the ghouls arrive. They seemed to have arrived too early as the chase/kill scenes got boring.

8128201,4,B000G0O58W,Good story.  Don't believe I've ever seen a ghoul flick before.  Acting is a little amateurish but I can work with it.  I love low budget horror.  One quibble - and it's a tough one - sound track has a delay that makes watching kind of tiring.,1278892800,,243,4.1063829787234045
8128202,4,B000G0O58W,"To be honest, I went into this movie expecting a 1 or 2 star ""maniac-stalks-and-slays-teens-in gruesome-fashion"" elephant turd. Well, I was mistaken. Sometimes it's good to be wrong! Yes, the budget is extremely tiny. Yes, the acting is stiff and downright funny in spots. Yes, the dialogue tends to be silly at times. Still, the story is very inovative, and the sfx are gruesome and believable. The more I watched, the more I enjoyed THE LONELY ONES. I especially liked the way we get to see the ghouls' perspective: the way they think, what they say to each other, and what they're planning. This movie pulls no punches in it's portrayal of murder, dismemberment, and cannibalism. I was amazed by some of the gore scenes! One in particular had me spitting out my beverage! So, you gorehndts should get a warm feeling from this one! I would say that THE LONELY ONES has a slow, mediocre beginning, a fast, unpredictable middle, and a dynamite ending. Check it out...",1219276800,,967,4.761904761904762
8128203,4,B000G0O58W,"I watched this on the Zone Horror channel on a night where films were being played after votes from viewers. Having seen the film, I can see why this was a choice for a prime time viewing slot from the viewers...

The plot sees nine students go away on a weekend to a lonely cabin far in the woods , in northern Arizona. On the way they are warned that a group of girls went missing in the 1980s in a nearby location. Undeterred, they make their way to their weekend retreat. To their horror they later find out that their cabin was none other than the very place that the previous group went missing. Worse, they soon realise that the same predators await them in the forests outside, and that those predators are an ancient race of carnivorous ghouls - The Lonely Ones who have an appetite for human flesh.... A terrifying fight for survival then ensues as the group desperately try to make it through the night.

Sure the film is low budget and the SFX while acceptable could have been better. It is nonetheless an absorbing film that really takes off once the group start their fight for survival. On an initial look, the story and setting are hardly original. However, the cast acquit themselves well and manage to keep their characters above being the usual plastic fodder for the bad guys. There are some good twists in the plot and the film remains quite suspenseful. It is gory but does not become gratuitous, despite the ever increasing body count.

Director David Michael Quiroz has made an enthralling and enjoyable horror film here, and is definitely a name to watch out for in the future on the strength of this showing. This is a film that is gaining a solid standing within the Horror Genre from word of mouth and deservedly so.

8128205,4,B000G0O58W,"Lower-budget production is the only flaw that has me grade this film down to a B+.  Starts out w/ many horror cliches: Sorority girls murdered in the 1980's; but no trace ever found.  Today, city kids drive up to remote cabin in Northern Arizona forest for good time.  This is the same area where the sorority disappeared.  There are romantic and sexual tension in the air.  They start partying, get drunk, and start to freak each other out w/scary stories.  What's next is beyond unpredictable and is why this film stands out above your typical trash.  There's actually an elaborate plot behind the whole trip up to the cabin.  (I won't spoil it for you.)  No this is not a grade A film like Alien, The Grudge, Saw, The Exorcist or something.  But it's not a C grade or worse film either.",1157241600,10,789,4.492957746478873
