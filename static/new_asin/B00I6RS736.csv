6252935,5,B00I6RS736,"Give Princess Nine a chance--after four episodes you and your whole family will be hooked.  The basic plot is that the principal of a girls' high school wants (for mysterious reasons of her own) to put together a girls' baseball team to compete in the boys' championship tournament.

You do not need to be into sports drama or girls' shows to love this series.  You just have to love great characters and great storytelling.  The characters are the real strength of the show: for example, the 'antagonist' Izumi is one of the most compelling and complex characters I have ever seen on television, animated or not.  I could understand each character's motivations and fully understand (but not predict) their behavior.  Some of the minor characters are a bit one-dimensional, but they all get at least one great moment in the sun.  P9 may have the best original score of any anime I've seen, except maybe Cowboy Bebop.  The animation is not of the highest quality, although the character designs are good and they put in extra effort for the important scenes and Ryo's crazy pitches.

P9 has all the sports drama you could want, including different strategies for each game; a drunken lazy but brilliant coach; a love triangle that is actually interesting; and a great ""putting-the-team-together"" sequence.  It's inspiring and positive, but never preachy, and it's not afraid to get into some interestingly dark emotional territory.  The ending is absolutely perfect, which I have never seen in anime.

Again, this show is NOT just for sports fans, or for fans of girly anime: it's for anyone who likes a great story and amazing characters.  There's very little that could be called ""fan service,"" especially considering the opportunities provided by the setting.  Adults and kids of both sexes will enjoy it--my son (13), daughter (10), and wife all loved it--but ideally the kids should be old enough to read the subtitles (if they don't speak Japanese), because the English dub is **far** inferior in quality to the original Japanese voice acting.  Sorry to be a subtitle snob, but without the subtleties of the original voice acting it's just not the same show.

If you love great TV you cannot go wrong with Princess Nine.  Get over the title and check it out.",1396483200,6,2264,4.884816753926701
8639644,2,B00I6RS736,"The only issue I really had was when I played all the episodes, some of the discs stopped running as soon as I got to the previews for the next episode.
If you encounter this problem, one will have to turn off EVERYTHING in order for it to play again; to avoid this, skip the credits and next episode preview.",1488931200,,309,4.166666666666667
8639645,5,B00I6RS736,"Well, if you insist on knowing how it ends before even starting, the title of my review should let you know; like the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-News-Bears/dp/B00AEFXHNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad News Bears</a>, you don't watch this today because you are wondering about the outcome.  However, unlike the case of most of the copycat post-1976 sports shows that are more unwatchable than the copycat pre-1976 sports shows (because the utterly predictable outcome of losing is worse than the formerly utterly predictable outcome of winning), this series holds its own and makes you cheer even though the heroines come up just a little bit short.

That's partly because in all the sports movies or TV shows I've ever watched, the deck has never been so stacked against.  Of the 9 total players (that's right, unlike in every other school, every single girl has to play every single inning of every single game), 8 have to struggle with one or more damning problems before the season even begins, half of those have their problems continue into the season, and half of those quite literally face death.  They don't even obtain 9 total players until episode 10, the third (!) attempt to disqualify the girls the right to play on equal terms with the boys in the Summer Koshien tournament doesn't fail until episode 18, and the girls don't even start playing games in the tournament until episode 23.

And don't get me started about the love triangles.  In addition to the brutal, all-consuming, 5 party mess that is still roiling into the last episode, you have in addition the nearly 20-year-old mess that started the whole thing and an intriguing possibility for the future, not counting the one that spins off the 5 party mess.  And none of the participants are all sinners or all saints.  Never seen anything like this in other sports shows!

The other thing that is clear throughout is that the story would go on.  Keiko Himuro is absolutely laughed at for initially promising her freshman girls baseball team will make it to Koshien in three years, but we only see one year in the show.  Even one of the people who worked on the show notes in an interview included as an Extra on one of the DVD's wishing he got the chance to work on seasons 2 and 3.  Alas, no such seasons were ever made, and the story stops at least a season short of Koshien, but like the girls we can dream.  If they got this far after all they had to go through in season 1, they'd have to be one of the most feared teams in seasons 2 and 3.

Note: One of the spectaculars about this series not as obvious at first is the quality level of the music; at a time when most TV series didn't see anything close to this effort, this soundtrack was a labor of love at an intensity level far above what anyone was expecting in 1998, and the two CD's are worth tracking down:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Nine/dp/B00009NH7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Nine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Nine-2/dp/B0000A4G8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Nine 2</a>.",1475452800,,3223,5.233009708737864
8639646,4,B00I6RS736,"A good baseball anime, but still not anywhere close to classics like ""Major"" or ""Ace of Diamond,"" ""Princess Nine"" gets off to a great start.  It features an interesting cast of characters, a disparate gang of girls each with different skill sets, of course their leader is Ryo Hayakawa, whose father was once a great baseball player, and who managed to inherit his ability to throw a blazing fastball that sends blades of grass flying as it is hurled from the pitcher's mound to the plate.  Naturally, it wouldn't be a baseball anime if the lead character weren't a pitcher, who of course happens to also be a leftie.  This was a fine show with themes of overcoming prejudice and discrimination in that girls normally don't play hard baseball, only softball.  It has good production values and in particular I would draw attention to its brilliant orchestral score.  It is one of the few anime that I actually own the soundtrack (released on 2 CDs) to.  Princess Nine falls short of being great though, it is a typical anime that is great right up to the very end.  The ending, unfortunately is a complete let down. So many anime shows don't know how to end properly and Princess Nine is yet another example of that.  When I showed this series to a fellow anime fan, he was into it until the last episode: ""man that sucked. Why did we even watch this?!"" Princess Nine is a show that is content to push the envelope a little but not really change things.  Gender boundaries can be challenged but ultimately, baseball is still a MAN's game.  That's the message I got from this show. Don't these people know there are no ""moral victories"" in sports???",1471305600,,1648,4.593856655290103

8639651,3,B00I6RS736,"This series is pretty good it's very dramatic though. it gets annoying that some of the girls team players almost lose games because of feelings for boys and stuff get in the way of their game play.
The product is a regular dvd case with six discs. I really like how each disc has artwork of a diffrent character on it. My only problem is that the girl on disc four has tan skin but in the anime she has light skin. its not really a big deal but I noticed it right away when I opened the dvd case for the first time",1406592000,,515,3.9615384615384617
8639652,5,B00I6RS736,"This is a terrific story. It has heart, courage, romance, real character development. While it's like a girls against the world anime, it shows how people can overcome things and achieve worthwhile goals. It is heartwarming, too. And it says a lot about how tough and competitive girls/women can be, in spite of the gender differences.
Besides, I really enjoyed watching this!",1404691200,,376,5.080645161290323
8639653,5,B00I6RS736,"I'm so glad Lucky Penny is re-releasing this gem of a series and keeping it at 6 discs instead of putting it on 4. I'm not going to get too much into the story but if you've ever watched sports animes, it's got the same principles. The build the team, camaraderie, hardships are all in this series. This is one of my favorite series and I'm glad I'm able to pick it back up. I'm also glad Lucky Penny kept the ADV dub as I actually enjoy watching this series in English. Hopefully with this series no longer being oop, fans who have never seen the original can pick this up and enjoy it. Top 5 sports title, my opinion, along with Slam Dunk, Cross Game, H2 and Wild Striker in no particular order. If you've never seen this series, do yourself a favor and buy it. You won't regret it.",1396656000,4,784,4.198675496688741
