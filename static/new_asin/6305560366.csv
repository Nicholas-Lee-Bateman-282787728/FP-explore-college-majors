7892245,5,6305560366,"But the main character is not Pedro Infante, but Angel Infante (his brother).  Pedro does make a cameo appearance in the movie.  It is, nonetheless, an outstanding comedy, the kind they don't make any more! I have been looking for this movie forever!!!!",1401148800,,253,4.8604651162790695
7892246,4,6305560366,"Another good movie from pedro, not one of the best he has made but none the less very good, especially if you are collecting his movies.",1399852800,,136,4.269230769230769
7892247,5,6305560366,"I have been looking for this movie for a long time. No store had it ! I recommend it to all.  It's about  father who uses his daughter to catch rich husbands, but wasn't counting a smart rancher who made sure to teach all them a lesson. Pretending to be a just another worker at his ranch and his employee pretending to be the rich owner. He put the in-laws to work out in the fields the mother in law in the kitchen and the wife and sister n law to house chores. It is halerious and romantic. All in one. I won't give out the ending you must watch it...enjoy",1363564800,,559,4.027027027027027
7892248,4,6305560366,"it was a very entertaining movie, I liked it very much, the way it was described made it sound like the main character was Pedro Infante but he was not, I enjoyed it anyways",1357603200,,173,4.117647058823529
7892249,5,6305560366,"A Comedia Ranchera, this film is about a fast talking aristocrat who has fallen on hard times, and tries to marry his pretty daughters off to wealthy men, to avoid having to work. As part of his plan, he takes them to a fancy nightclub, where they meet a naive but rich ranch owner who is smitten by one of the daughters. Then the plot thickens; the daughter is stubborn and self-indulgent, and the rancher must go to great lengths to ""tame"" her. Though die-hard feminists will not be amused, the twists and turns are very funny.

The cast is great:

It does not star the wonderful singing cinema idol Pedro Infante (1917-1957), but rather his brother Angel. Pedro makes a special appearance, in the beginning, a little later to sing a duo with Angel, and at the end, when he crashes his airplane into the ranch; in this last scene, he sings one of his most outstanding performances on film. This song is superb, and will delight every Pedro Infante fan. The plane crash is a sad omen, as this was how he was to die 5 years after this film was made.

Fernando Soler (1896-1979), who had a distinguished career of over 100 films as actor, and 22 as director, plays the elderly aristocrat, Anastasio Adolfo Armijo de Arpegio; Silvia Pinal, who was one of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's favorite actresses (""Virdiana""), plays the obnoxious Isabel, and Angel Infante (1914-1987) as the rancher, Jose Manuel, is terrific. Tito Gomez adds a lot of humor as the aristocrat's son, who was brought up by an Argentine uncle.

The songs, assisted by the legendary Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, are: La del estribo; Como estoy enamorado; Te he de querer; Las alazanas, La negra, Las Isabeles, as well as the title song, Por ellas aunque mal paguen.

Directed by Juan Bustillo Oro almost entirely on a soundstage, this may not be the most original of plots, but is fun-filled merriment, and with an unforgettable song by Pedro Infante, who is after all these years, still so dear to many hearts.",1176768000,7,1973,4.674351585014409
