8550215,3,B00ADQDTMM,"This 8 film set reeks of low budget tv or straight to video releases. Still, there are some bright spots and positive aspects. I'll review each film individually:

The Secret Kingdom:
A family discovers a tiny kingdom under there kitchen sink. The children are transported there by a rebel group of the kingdom of Relkin, a place where their religion allows for the surgical alteration of the brains of anyone believing that a world exists beyond their own. Can the kids get home AND save the kingdom from an evil dictatorial perfection seeking freak? It sounds great on the surface but many of the plot's points aren't fully realized. Why are so many of the people of Relkin without eyes? What allowed for such a dictator to have control of Relkin? How did they know technology that could shrink a person from our world and transport them to theirs? How did they even know the size of the people in our world so they could shrink one? Still, all these shortcomings aside, The Secret Kingdom is an enjoyable film to watch unfold. Don't let the slow start sway you as it picks up rather quickly and keeps it's steam up until the end. Remember to watch thru the credits so you can discover what happened to the evil leader. It's pretty amusing. 3 stars overall.

The Kingdom Of El:
A family inherits a beautifully scenic old English property with a history of tales about faeries inhabiting the property as well as a tale of a gold mine where several faeries were trapped more than 100 years prior. With their dad deathly ill having only a couple months to live, will they save the faeries in time for them to heal dad's illness or will they instead give in to local superstitions that the faeries are actually demons trapped in the mine? This is another case where the small budget doesn't really matter as the story is engaging and interesting enough to outweigh any negative aspects such as the boom microphone seen twice in the opening scene or the meager special effects involving the faeries. fantasy/ sci fi B-movie veteran actors Corbin Bernsen and Malcolm Macdowall use their acting chops well here and the messages about the dangers of evils of the heart and the strong emotional bonds of the family resonate beautifully. Another solid film. 3.25 stars

The Meeksville Ghost:
Judge Reinhold, horribly miscast as a wild west sharpshooter is the cursed ghost of a hotel in an old west town that is now largely deserted save for the few tourists who occasionally visit. The town's property is being acquired by an evil real estate developer who has ties to the original person who shot down Reinhold's character. Enter our protagonist: a teen who drifts into town only to discover that he too has ties to the history of this now nearly defunct town. Will he be able to stop the developer and end the ghost's curse?The acting in this film is atrocious even in light of it's non existent budget. The story, if you can call it that, is as thin as the budget, with our hero bonking his head every few minutes at the grins of Reinhold's ghostly visage. Don't waste your time on this one, you'll be wanting those minutes back.... badly... 0 stars.

After the Wizard:
Another great idea not fully realized. An orphan girl known for using the books at the orphanage as an escape from he problems gets a healthy dose of reality when the scarecrow and tin man from the Wizard of Oz show up in the flesh, sure that she is Dorothy and can help them with their quest to lead Oz properly. The premise could have been sensational as the film does have some amusing situations involving the scarecrow and tin man's attempts to fit into our world as they try and find 'Dorothy'. Along the way they meet an old and wise blind man who they are convinced is a wizard due to his intelligence and ability to reason. The animal shelter where they try and find Dorothy's dog Toto was amusing and cute as well. The problem starts with the costumes for our two main characters: The scarecrow is pretty good overall, but he's wearing a straw fedora, not a straw cowboy hat, and the tin man wears no metal at all, instead he's in a grey cotton shirt and what appear to be grey dickies pants and a winter beanie as well as what appear to be plastic shin guards attached to inline skating elbow guards and baseball gloves worn on his arms. I can understand 'low budget' but surely they could have done better on the costumes. They appeared to be playing in some local theater play, where such inconsistencies could be overlooked. The acting on the part of the girl, who you are led to believe the story should be about, is dreadful. Surely there were other young actresses who could have pulled off the role. The direction and storytelling is off, like they tried to tell two different stories at the same time, but because of the girl's uninspiring performance, this is clearly the scarecrow and tin man's story all the way. In spite of the wardrobe failures, horrifyingly bad acting of the girl and plot misdeeds they do an admirable job at trying to plod their way thru the dreck. 2.25 stars.

The Journey:
I tried many times to watch this film and each time I found myself unable to make head or tail of it. Every time, I found myself turning it off about 30 minutes into it. It is apparently, unwatchable. 0 stars

The Sorceror's Apprentice:
No, this isn't the Disney version from 2010, this one is from England and was made in 2002 and is one of this set's best films. A boy named Ben meets his destiny (and Merlin) as the one entrusted with wielding an incredibly powerful staff, a staff so powerful that it could overcome the person holding it with great negative power. Is Ben strong enough to keep the negative power from overcoming him and stop Morgana, an evil witch, from getting the staff? There isn't a whole lot of story to hold the film together as far as the magical aspects, this is really about Ben becoming more confident in his life and understanding that he can make his own destiny in life in general, not become a prisoner of it. The growing friendship between Merlin and Ben is also fun to watch. You get a true sense that the friendship is genuine. At first, Merlin isn't sure he can trust that Ben is definitely the one to acquire the staff, but he gives in as their friendship grows and he helps Ben cultivate power of the spirit, the most powerful magic of all. If you're looking for a terrific film to add to your magic collection, The Sorceror's Apprentice is worth the price of this set all by itself. 4.75 stars

Merlin: the Return:
This enjoyable but slightly confusing sword and sorcery tale involving Merlin, King Arthur and the knights of the round table and two unwitting kids that stumble upon a scientist's nefarious plans to bring back Mordred, an evil sorceror banished in his own time to a life of imprisonment throughout time. The sword in the stone and stonehenge come into play and it's (of course) up to the kids to save the world alongside the knights. The sword fighting scenes are often better than ones you'd see in more expensive big budget films and there is evidence that most of the budget was spent on special effects as there are plenty of magical energy effects present throughout the film. Acting is above par for a movie of this caliber as well. As is the case with most of the low budget films, the plot and pace stumbles a bit at times, but in the end you're left with a feeling that you've just seen a very substantial film. 4.25 stars

Teen Sorcery:
Another stinker. I REALLY want my wasted time back from this one. Geek teen girls versus popular teen girls, all using witchcraft. Stereotypes galore, including the librarian who exaggeratedly holds up a pair of old fashioned spectacles on a stick. The acting is subpar as is the story (actually, there is NO story to speak of except revenge of the geeks against the popular girls) Think Jawbreaker or Shes All That meets Sabrina the Teenage Witch along with Ordinary Magic, only without any engaging characters, humor or memorable, substantial moments. This ties with The Journey and Meeksville Ghost for worst film in the set. Absolutely abysmal. 0 stars

So there it is. Some good films, a couple great films, some mediocre films, and some to skip altogether. There are indeed solid reasons to buy this set so if you're in the market for some interesting magical fantasy films,",1405814400,,8370,4.582109479305741
