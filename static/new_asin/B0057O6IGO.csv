4597295,5,B0057O6IGO,"If I was going to put together a top 5 outrageous comedy anime list, this series would most definitely be on it.
This show dives right into the comedy without the usual 2 or 3 episodes of plot development that most series usually start out with, it has some very funny and unexpected references to other mainstream anime and some very talented voice actors in Japanese, no English dubs on this one.
  The main male character is a masochist who's trying to overcome his problem and seeks out help from the Second Voluntary Club only to find out the girl who caused him to become masochistic in the first place is one of the members. As if that's not bad enough he finds out the ""girl"" he has a crush on is really his(male) friend who is a cross dresser, don't worry guys he says he's not gay, although according to this anime, cross dressing is great way to slip into the women's restroom undetected.... I'll have to remember that next time.
  I can't really describe how awesome this show is without using a bunch of expletives that amazon wouldn't like or giving away too much of the comedy so I'll just say this: If you like your comedy on the outrageous side buy this show, you won't regret it.",1336694400,10,1197,4.427272727272728
4597296,5,B0057O6IGO,"This story won't have an end, cause the author was gone. Such a bad thing. I've watched this anime, and I think it's fun. The reason why I buy it is not just because I want to watch it again, but to remember the author.",1326758400,5,219,3.888888888888889
4597297,5,B0057O6IGO,"I watched this show before it came out in the states, in two words to describe it: different, amazing :)
its very interesting because it dabbles in the flavor of S&M without being porn.
Theres sadism,masochism,fear of men,cosplay fetish, megalomaniac, plenty of complex situations with each character,
I would reccomend this to any fan who thinks that they've seen it all. because this is different from most run-of-the-mill anime ;)",1322265600,2,433,5.2
4597298,5,B0057O6IGO,"Alright everyone! This isn't your basic happy love anime, its a straight up comedy. It has it's moments where it's just to much but you'll find out those are the funniest. You will quote this show, and pretty much fall in love with it. The show is about a guy who needs help with his S&M problem, so he meets a girl who claims to be god. She says she can cure everything because who she is. With his problem trying to get cured he ends up joining her club, so he can be fixed (...so he thinks).

Animation is pretty much the same as every other cute comedies. Big eyes, adorable girls, and school boys.
The language for this show is not for minors.
The situations in this show is not for minors.",1315699200,15,695,4.186567164179104
4597299,3,B0057O6IGO,I love this show but why is aren't there english dubbing? This is becoming more common and I don't like it. The seems like a reasonable solution to series that might not sell as well but I have seen many slip through the cracks lately that would have been great with english dubbing.,1313884800,10,283,4.3584905660377355
4597300,3,B0057O6IGO,"There are twisted tales and twisted tales, but few are as twisted as poor Sado's, who's just realized that he actually likes being made miserable. Of course, knowing that only makes him more miserable, which in turn... well, you get the idea. Desperate to break the circle, Sado volunteers for a special club where he hopes he can work through his issues only to discover that the other members have equally... complex... issues to deal with.

For example, the hyper-aggressive club president Isurugi not only has a violent fear of cats, but also believes herself to be a god! Then there's Yuno, who's terrified of men; the Nurse, who forces other people to perform cosplay; and Hayama, Sado's best friend and a compulsive cross-dresser, who's also the girl that Sado is infatuated with.

Contains episodes 1-12.

The box contains 2 discs... That's all, a little disappointing... But the series is awsome!",1378339200,,254,4.3125

8460952,4,B0057O6IGO,"No Hentai, Fanfare and Harem. . .

So. . .a high school guy has a problem, He's a masochist in a big way.  But their is a solution to his problems when he meets a sadist.  His best friend is a transvestite.  His mom and big sister want to be his girlfriends.  The nurse loves cosplay.  The other member of the club is an androphobic.  Her best friend hates pervs.  I almost forgot about the brilliant Lolicon. . . Its all relatively PG-13 in nature with the talk and how indepth they get.

I was thoroughly amused.  Minus one star for the short series that could have had more, but you can only due so much with a theme like that without getting into Hentai.",1366588800,,658,4.192
8460953,5,B0057O6IGO,This anime may be a bit weird but it was always making me laugh.  If you like comedy and random acts of things that happen to the main character I would recommend this.,1365811200,,168,4.090909090909091
8460954,4,B0057O6IGO,"Sado has a serious problem. He's a hyper masochist. He gets seriously turned on by being abused by cute girls. Mio is the president of the 2nd volunteer club at their high school. Mio is a hyper sadist. She hears of his issue and decides to use her sadist powers and self proclaimed god powers to cure him. Sado joins the club along with the shy and cute Yuno (who happens to have a crush on Sado, as well as a terrible fear of men). Along with the perverted cosplay obsessed school nurse, the 4 weirdos experience many crazy things on the path to curing Sado and Yuno's psychological problems.

This anime is totally off the wall. It's like Haruhi Suzumiya meets Toradora and Baka & Test, but on tons of crack. The production quality is pretty high. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting is all really good. The story is kind of thin, as you can surmise from the synopsis. Even with the manic nature this show leans toward, the characters do develop quite well. It's only 12 episodes long, so there isn't much time for in-depth character development. It's super funny. The masochist thing does get old to me after a while, and I started wishing that they would just focus more on the character relationships.

Overall, this anime was pretty entertaining. I got it for under 20 bucks, so I fell like I got a good deal. I can't give this show 5 stars though. I already mentioned that it got kind of monotonous towards the end, but I have 1 other complaint. It's not dubbed in English. Some people don't care if they have to read subs, but I'm one of those that prefers to relax and focus on something other than the bottom of the screen. Sentai Filmworks seems to be lazy about dubbing the anime that they put out in America. They dub some shows that suck, like Battle Girls and ignore some things that are pretty good, like this one. Those are the 2 things that keep me from giving it 5 stars. I did enjoy it quite a bit though. It's a good anime.",1364083200,2,1953,4.392265193370166
8460955,5,B0057O6IGO,"I got two word's to sum up this anime ""Complete Randomness""!
I totally fell in love with this show from first episode too last! The plot may be random but it does have a plot nonetheless. Basically the Main character ""Sado Taro"" is a guy who is perfectly normal. (When a cute girl DOESN'T torture him in any way) BUT!!! When they do hurt him in any way (mainly HER the Queen of S) it triggers an alternate version of him. Mainly the Super Masochist version of him. ""Surprisingly"" he's not the only one with a skeleton in the closet.
Like his best friend Tatscitchi is an ""Extreme Crossdresser"" who is also a completely cool fellow when he is in guy clothes. (But when he is called beautiful or looks good on you when he is in girl clothes) he becomes the character he play's as.
And then there's Yuno who's terrified of men when she get's too close (and I mean 3 meters close) except for Sado cuz she thinks of him as a dog.(Also she's super hot w/ a nack for punching Taro in the face)
A girl who thinks she's GOD Ms. Isurugi (who's afraid of cat's) and is a Sadist/Tsundare Queen cuz she loves torturing Taro, but hides the feeling she has for him BECAUSE she doesn't really know what it is yet. (Also she the most adorable Protoganist ever!)
Ms. Michiron who's a cosplay lover who loves dressing ppl up for her own satisfactory. (Mainly Girls)
A super Guiness... That doesn't really have a problem just that she feels lonely.
Her side kick with a Lolita Complex!
Taro's boss who's infatuated with anime girls!
A sister with a Bro-con fetish.
A mother with a MotherXSon Complex.
A Girl who loves feeling up women.
And others...
But mainly what I love about this anime is the completely random event's that take place in a highschool that spells out Hentai!
So enjoy this hilarous comedy! Laugh your butt off! Cry with tears of laughter! See Taro's cool moments! And then laugh some more because this show is ""painfully"" funny.
Unless your not that much of a perv or nvr thought being a little perverted is funny... Cuz trust me when I say this butt uhh... If not older then 18 or you nvr had a perverted conversation or never heard of a perverted conversation... Yeah probably not your ganre...",1355356800,,2196,4.465174129353234
8460956,5,B0057O6IGO,"This anime is a great anime from the start to the finish. on  episode i did not lose interest once bc its was so funny, and there was somthing new to offer in this anime. I won't tell u about the anime bc i don't want to giveaway anything and theres already a description the dvd. So there, thats how i feel about this anime",1346889600,,324,3.9846153846153847
8460957,5,B0057O6IGO,"I wish there could be more. Me and my cousin loved it! I'll buy this soon. Love MM!
Wish the price were a little lower since it's only 12 episodes, though...",1343174400,,157,4.096774193548387
