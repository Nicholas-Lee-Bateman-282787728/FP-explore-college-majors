3100751,5,B0012Z36EO,"I have been hoping for some time that this show would make it to DVD. This is one of the best Sci-Fi series you will ever see.

I faintly remember it from childhood. I year ago, I had the pleasure of watching both seasons--wow! Very intriguing and captivating. You quickly get pulled into David's nightmare. While there are some problems with the logic of some of the plots, it is one of the most plausible shows of this genre.",1201910400,7,427,4.405063291139241
3100752,4,B0012Z36EO,"Well, it is time that this series got its due on DVD.  My parents liked
the Fugitive.  I like it, sorta(at 15, I thought Kimble was too wussie),
but The Invaders, man sci-fi and Vincent kicking alien  wayyy coooooooool!  I enjoyed Invaders so much, I even got the VHS copies release of single episodes at Hastings over a 13 week period.  Thanks be to the people who released the 1st season.  Let's hope they do the 2nd season as well.",1201824000,9,434,4.3625
3100753,5,B0012Z36EO,"When I was a kid, this show truly terrified me and DID give me nightmares - but I loved it anyway! Now, at long last, the original, iconic Sci-Fi TV Classic ""The Invaders"" is being released on DVD in boxed season sets. The first 17 episodes have been gathered in the initial DVD release.

The Invaders, which premiered on ABC in 1967, starred Roy Thinnes. It was a mid-season replacement show that was an hour-long, full-color science fiction thriller that sadly lasted only 43 episodes. Families across the country truly gathered around their TV sets when the series aired on Tuesday's at 8:30 p.m. to see what happened next.

The show opened with an unforgettable and chilling narration: ""The Invaders, a Quinn Martin Production starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent. The Invaders - alien beings from a dying planet. Their destination - the Earth. Their purpose: to make it `their' world. David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut that he never found. It began with a closed, deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy. Now, David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here; that they have taken human form. Somehow, he must convince a disbelieving world, that the nightmare has already begun...""

Voice talents were Hank Simms, who was the introductory narrator, and William Woodson who was episode narrator for the entire series.

In the first episode, Vincent is driving home at night after working a long, tiring day. He turns onto what he believes is a shortcut, then down the dark, isolated road. Unexpectedly, he ends up at Bud's Cafe, situated in a ghost town. Exhausted, he decides to park to rest for a while before continuing home. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, something wakes him: a strange glowing object is ""landing"" in front of his eyes.

Leaving his car and edging forward, he sees the advance army of what he learns is an alien invasion. From that moment forward, he tries to warn a skeptical world that there are aliens in their midst masquerading as humans. At the same time, he struggles to stay alive - because not only had he seen the aliens, but they had seen him!

While the premise seems simple in this day and age, the series had such great production values, flawless acting by Thinnes, fantastically creepy music by Dominic Frontiere, use of creative and intentionally distorted camera work, and even weird title credits by Wayne Fitzgerald, that it really did scare the wits out of legions of fans. In addition, the true form of the Invaders was never shown, so viewers' imaginations were encouraged to run wild, an effective creative device that has been sadly abandoned in this ""show everything no matter what"" Internet age.

As the series progressed, Vincent was able to identify some Invaders through certain characteristics, and he also learned that their human forms were unstable and had to be ""regenerated"" occasionally, or they would perish.

In 1995, there was a feeble attempt to resurrect the show in a mini-series starring Scott Bakula as Nolan Wood, with an appearance by Thinnes.

""The Invaders"" remains so popular that in 2004 the character of David Vincent was ranked No. 6 in TV Guide's list of the Twenty-Five Greatest Sci-Fi Legends.

It may not be coincidental that The Invaders seems an intriguing mix of the Sci-Fi film masterpiece ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and the TV Classic drama ""The Fugitive,"" which was also produced by the brilliant Quinn Martin, who also produced The Untouchables, and The Streets of San Francisco, to name a few.

Episodes included in this boxed set are: Beachhead; The Experiment; The Mutation; The Leeches; Genesis; Vikor; Nightmare; Doomsday Minus One; Quantity: Unknown; The Innocent; The Ivy Curtain; The Betrayed; Storm; Panic; Moonshot; Wall of Crystal; The Condemned.

Let's hope the remainder of this fantastic series will be quickly released on DVD.",1201392000,194,4020,4.921713441654357

3100769,3,B0012Z36EO,"Whatever enjoyment I experience from watching this series is to approach it as an artifact from the 1960's, when sci-fi tv series had to rely on low-budget, low-tech FX. Each episode is written, more or less, to stand on its own.  The plot threads are weak, and sometimes silly, but somehow they got a lot of good actors to appear in individual episodes (Ed Asner, Ann Francis, Richard Anderson, et al). Roy Thinnes tries his best, but his acting chops are not that strong.  The writing (including dialog) is wooden and uninspiring.  One plus, however, is seeing all those humongous cars that Detroit was rolling out in the 1960's.  This review also applies to Season 2",1470700800,,669,4.741379310344827

From then on, Vincent becomes aware that the nonhuman aliens have taken on human form and are here in numbers, with the purpose of wiping out humanity and taking the planet.

Bear in mind that this is filmed in 1967 when we had the ""nuclear threat"" and ""cold war"" always being blared at us on television. Imagine those who had lived through the ""McCarthy days"" Inquisition which turned Americans on Americans to accommodate the HUAC.

I'd also forgotten (or never noticed) its inherent goofiness and occasional lack of continuity.  Example:  In the 2nd episode the cop in his patrol car wears a motorcycle cop's helmet.  In the car ... out of the car ... he wears his crash helmet.  Huh?  The show has many more odd quirks than I remembered, but the creepiness is still intact.  Its fun seeing some of the guest stars, like Grandma Walton (Helen Corbett) playing an evil, stiff-pinkied alien.  Am glad I made the purchase.

3100793,5,B0012Z36EO,"I first watched this show when the Sci-Fi channel was new and actually showed classic sci-fi. My mom told me that she also watched this show on TV when it was new in her younger years and was also glad to see it on the Sci-Fi channel. That didn't last long, as we all sadly know how that channel turned out. Watching this in proper order for the first time after it came out was a real treat. I was very impressed at the production quality and special effects in this show, truly state of the art by 1960s standards. I was truly scared for David Vincent at times, wondering how the advanced alien technology would be used against him. I had the same feeling when the ""V"" mini-series was on TV back in the early 1980s. I thought the alien technology was truly frightening in ways. I felt like a bug in a jar, not knowing really who or what was watching or when, and that I had nowhere to hide and no defense if they ever wanted to come get me. I liked how the show and David progressed as the season went on, evolving as he learned more and more. I don't think the aliens were as dumb and incapable as they were sometimes shown, though. I think they probably could have liquidated anyone they wanted at anytime. They did continually thwart Vincent's plans, though, no how carefully prepared. Like ""Khan"" from Star Trek, they managed to kill everyone else but like a poor marksman they kept missing the target.

  To sum up, if you're expecting the kind of cheesy Lost In Space or Thunderbirds kind of TV series and special effects and plots, you're going to be pleasantly surprised here. Think more on the lines of ""Star Trek"" special effects from the same time period and you'll be right. Combine that quality with the drama and suspense of shows like..well..Star Trek, but with intense intrigue and mystery like I Spy or Mission Impossible or one of those type of shows, or THE FUGITIVE! Yeah, there's some of that in here.

  There were also a couple of movies that came out in the 1990's, ""The Arrival"", and it's sequel ""The Arrival 2"" that were virtually a copy of this show's premise. They could have just as accurately been called ""The Invaders: The movie"" 1 and two. They were good movies too.",1436572800,2,2200,4.433168316831683

Quinn Martin Productions put out very good shows and the Music is by the Guy who did the Outer Limits Dominic Frontier ( may misspelled His last name ) , so you know its creepy music that adds to the suspense  and each week they have some very good guest stars . I had my local library order them to my delight and hope others see this set at the libraries . Theres no CC , though the discs are transferred well , though not digitally but still very good quality . I love the cars from the 60's , unlike the FBI another Q. M . Production who only used Fords, this show uses all types of cars .

3100799,1,B0012Z36EO,"The Invaders - Season 1 [0574 - 11-11-2014 - TV show - SF] Summary:
  First off this is a 1960's Science-Fiction TV series concerned solely with the apparent clandestine invasion by alien beings from outer space - which look - talk - dress and behave like middle class folks you would encounter in any town in the 60's. Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) is apparently the only person in the United States who truly believes the space aliens have invaded and travels from coast to coast and points between to frustrate the invaders depraved goal of world domination. In each episode David encounters and puts a stop to their shenanigans - with the help of local folks who, after encountering the aliens and witnessing them turn a glowing red and disappear when killed still doubt their existence.

Content & Packaging:
5 disks - 17 episodes - first shown on ABC from 1/10/67 to 5/9/67. Season 1 is packaged in the standard, snap case - episode summaries are printed on the reverse of the cover insert - not very handy since you have to jimmy the disks to read the text. - The most interesting ""extra"" is the Roy Thinnes introduction to each episode.

Positive Comments:
 The show features many 1960's TV stars in supporting roles.
 Some of the locations are visually interesting but there is not mention in the credits where they a located.
 The video quality is very good - colors are true and vivid.

The Cast:
Even with the familiar faces in supporting roles none stand out in these dramas. Roy Thinnes is very good in a most difficult role - he has to convince us viewers that the aliens are real but ""somehow"" can not convince anyone else - think about that for a moment.

Negative Comments:
 The major failure of this show is that the creative talent - writers - producers - directors never bothered to even attempt to convince the viewer that David Vincent's efforts are credible and even marginally believable. I see it as contempt by them for the intelligence of their target viewer.
 Here we have an unemployed architect traveling all over the country - one week in Florida - next New England - then the mid-west (all suspiciously looking like southern California) - clutching a newspaper article about a strange event - finding the exact persons causing the mischief (aliens of course) defeating their nefarious scheme and musing that no one still believes him.
 How does he obtain the funds to travel all over the country? - He has no employment or benefactor and is not, by appearance or life style, wealthy. Also how does he obtain the newspaper items with the oddball occurrences from all over the United States?
 The aliens are fully aware that David Vincent is their sworn enemy - in fact Vincent has had many conversations with the space people and even was taken for a ride one of their saucers.
 Since he is such a thorn in the alien's side and they are aware that no one believes him why not just eliminate him - Vincent's efforts have resulted in the death of numerous aliens just in season 1 - so payback would be only fair.
 We have been informed in several episodes that the aliens have no pulse. All Vincent has to do is capture one of the aliens and bring him to a hospital or doctor to get the attention that he so desperately desires - of course that never happens.
 Let us assume that Vincent can travel everywhere since he is independently wealthy and can afford a super efficient service that reviews every newspaper in the country looking for those quirky news items that hint at the alien's schemes. If so then why doesn't Vincent hire some muscle to help him. In many episodes he get pummeled by several aliens and can hardly fend them off.
 If you watch all the episodes you will see the same light blue Ford pickup truck in several shows - I mean to say what the heck those stupid viewers won't notice.

Recommendations:
Watching these shows I learned a lesson about wishful nostalgia. You see in the winter of 1967 I viewed some of the """"Invader"" shows as a nave teenager. Fast forward almost 50 years and I was startled to see the shows were released on DVD - well so much for what I thought was entertainment as a teen. I did watch all 17 episodes hoping for redemption but, alas, there was none to be had.
I could only recommend this show to dedicated fans of early TV series and/or SF shows.

I did watch all season 2 of ""The Invaders' and was still disappointed. Yes David did convert a few followers but I still could not ""suspend my disbelief"" to recommend these shows. I will now openly admit that I now keep a sharp lookout for folks with bent pinky fingers who wear dark suit and drive around in Ford sedans.",1416009600,2,4670,4.5579450418160095
3100800,4,B0012Z36EO,"What if the conspiracy theorists were RIGHT?!? Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) discovers that at least one popular conspiracy - a secret alien invasion - is true, and as the season unfolds he learns the aliens plans for Earth do not involve the human race! Interestingly, the aliens do not always agree, and some of them actually don't support the invasion. But enough do, and are threaded through the world, that Vincent has trouble convincing people of their existence. He manages, here and there, and he makes enough noise about it that the aliens don't dare murder him, for fear folks will start taking him seriously. But that doesn't mean they're giving up.

3100807,4,B0012Z36EO,"After the success of The Fugitive, producer Quinn Martin's next effort built on the themes that worked so well in The Fugitive: a lone hero on a mission, finding that danger lurks in every town he visits, and never knowing who he can trust. However, instead of an accused killer trying to clear himself and avoid capture, this time the stakes are much higher. Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) has to convince the world they've been invaded by aliens whose goal is to conquer them from within.

The invaders appear human (although some of them have a deformed finger that allows Vincent to spot them more easily). They also have an advanced technology that helps them accomplish their goals (including a device with which they can kill people so that it appears the person dies of a cerebral hemorrhage). Most disconcerting for Vincent, when they die, which occurs frequently, they turn a glowing red and completely vanish, along with all their clothes and everything in their immediate possession. That makes Vincent's task of proving their existence considerably more difficult.

The show only lasted a season and a half, and this set includes the 17 episodes of the original half season (the show premiered in the winter). There are actually two versions of the pilot episode (in which Vincent learns of the alien's existence and that they have taken over a small California town), the version that aired and an extended version some ten minutes longer which works better. The show started to run out of gas midway in the second season, but this initial set has most of the best episodes and is of considerably better overall quality.

The plots generally involve just that, alien plots. Typically, Vincent hears of strange goings on in some location and goes to investigate, only to discover the aliens have set up some sort of facility he has to stop. For the most part, the aliens themselves are not mastermind geniuses or raving fanatics but average everyday sorts, and figuring out just who in a town is or is not an alien often keeps Vincent and viewers occupied for much of an episode. The quality of the guest cast is good, with a lot of familiar TV faces who would soon have shows of their own, such as Jack Lord, Peter Graves, Arthur Hill, William Windom, and Ed Asner. Thinnes himself wasn't the acting equal of David Janssen in The Fugitive, but he was good at portraying harried desperation that his character often felt.

The two best episodes are somewhat offbeat. In Vikki, Suzanne Pleshette plays the title character, an alien who hasn't fully bought into their plans and tries to help Vincent, while the two develop feelings for each other. In The Innocents, Michael Rennie plays an alien leader, who tries to convince Vincent that their goals for earth are really beneficial rather than harmful. This involves a bit of mind control on their part, and eventually, Vincent figures out what they really want.

Episodes like these two showed the series' potential, but most of the very rest fell into a familiar formula and weren't all that much different from the PI shows of the era. The only difference was that instead of trying to uncover a smuggling operation or drug ring, Vincent is trying to find a facility that enables the aliens to regenerate themselves or some other bizarre enterprise. The action may have felt familiar to audiences, but the episodes were quite well done.

The Invaders has become somewhat forgotten today, and a 90s attempted update as well as periodic feelers for a feature film have failed, but it proved to be the inspiration for many science fiction and action films and series over the years.

From the opening theme to the Epilog, Invaders captured me, again. The focus on exposing aliens from a dying planet almost never wavers. Only one episode gave David Vincent, our hero, a love interest. That is refreshing when so many present series thrust a new love into the mix week after week until they are killed off for a new face. Hard core fans will be delighted. This is not a documentary and makes no apologies for delivering as promished. What is interesting is Vietnam was in full swing, but is never mentioned.

  Special Features - see below
------------------------------------------------
I remember watching the show as a young teen in 1967.  We didn't have a color tv
so this was my first time to see it in color.

For me, the show was not as good as I remembered.  The David Vincent character is
so wooden that he could easily pass for one of the aliens.  Every episode has the
same tone or feel.  Compare that to a contemporary series like Star Trek where it
would vary from week to week.  It might be a drama, romance, comedy, action, tragedy, mystery, etc.

The creator, Larry Cohen, says his intent was to combine science fiction with the
""running man"" concept as in The Fugitive.  There was a new location each week and there were ""name"" guest stars but that is the extent of the similarity in my opinion.  The Invaders are not actively pursuing David Vincent and the police think he is just a kook.  He travels around the country openly (no alias).  I remember one episode where DV slugged a policeman and in the end he wasn't even charged!
Many episodes have the exact same story line:  DV reads about some strange occurrence.  He traves to the scene to investigate and uncovers an alien scheme.  He thwarts their plans but they manage to destroy all evidence.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Features

Episode intros by Roy Thinnes -  Most are only a couple sentences.  He gives the title and the date it originally aired.  RT seems bored.  He does add a little more on later episodes but the intros are not really worth watching.  How about some
interesting/funny anecdotes about your guest stars?

Expanded version of the pilot episode - a few extra scenes

Interview of Roy Thinnes - not a real interview.  RT talks about some preselected
topics.  It was an interesting feature.

Commentary by series creator Larry Cohen - One episode is shown with the audio muted and a voice-over by LC.  He didn't really comment on the episode itself.  It was just a rambling dialog, much of it about other tv shows and movies that he had
worked on.  He was very honest in telling about his concept for the show.  He wanted to do a Fugitive type show with a sci-fi theme which would evolve into a Mission Impossible show as a team was assembled to fight the Invaders.  He basically sold the concept and a bunch of story ideas and that was it.  The producer, Quinn Martin, had his own team of directors, writers, etc. so Larry Cohen was essentially shut out.  He didn't like the repetition of episodes as the show went on.  He thought there were too many Invaders and they were too easy to kill.

He was writing for tv at the tail end of the McCarthy/blacklisting era and was upset by what was going on.  He wanted to take the concept of the infiltration of society and make a ""mockery"" of it by putting it in terms of aliens from another planet.  That didn't make sense to me.  If he thought the anticommunist hearings were a witch hunt then shouldn't David Vincent have really been a kook, with the Invaders just in his imagination?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of aliens masquerading as humans is a classic sci-fi concept, most notably portrayed in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  It certainly deserved to be explored in a longer format but for me it just became repetitious as a weekly series.  It is too bad they didn't have miniseries back then as that would have been a good way to explore the idea in more depth.  I think the show would have been better if DV had a sidekick or love interest.  Suzanne Pleshette appeared in one episode as an alien who didn't fit in (with the Invaders) because she had developed feelings.  She would have been perfect as a companion for DV.  The show could have been played straight or as a spoof ala The Avengers.  It just needed some romance or humor or something to mix it up a bit.

The only thing that made it worth watching for me was seeing all the familiar guest stars.  It was like reuniting with an old friend.  Some from the first season:  Diane Baker, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, Arthur Hill, Jack Lord, Diana Hyland, Wm Windom, James Whitmore, Susan Strasberg, Michael Rennie, Susan Oliver, Ed Begley, Joseph Campanella, Barbara Luna, Peter Graves, Burgess Meredith, and Ralph Bellamy.

A reasonable price for this set would be about $15.00.  I probably will not buy the second season unless the price drops to that level.",1340064000,4,4534,4.7535301668806165
3100817,3,B0012Z36EO,"It isn't quite as I remember it, but it was entertaining.  It's hard to believe that good ol' David Vincent never got his hands on one of those alien weapons or grab some evidence just once. The aliens were just as lame: kidnapping and extortion? Just vaporize the guy after a certain point.",1317168000,,291,4.490566037735849
3100818,5,B0012Z36EO,"Quinn Martin, who made a name for himself in the TV crime drama genre, was admittedly not much of a sci-fi fan when he was pitched the idea for The Invaders, but went ahead with it and wound up creating one of the most memorable and scary shows of the late 1960's.

The series' pilot, ""Beachhead"", begins with the intro that would appear before the remaining episodes of the series: architect David Vincent is driving home from a business trip. Obviously groggy, he stops at a diner, hoping for a cup of coffee and a little respite from the road when, all of a sudden, he sees a flying saucer land at the diner. For the rest of the episode, Vincent tries to convince the townspeople what he saw; some folks are skeptical, while others believe him...most of those other folks being the aliens, who do pretty much everything to Vincent to get him out of town, even trying to frame him for the murder of his partner, Alan Landers (James Daly).

For the rest of this season, we see more of the same: Vincent traveling to a small town somewhere to meet with someone who could help him or to investigate some bizarre phenomena, ultimately running into aliens who want to kill him (their shiny disc to the back of the neck causing either heart attack or stroke) and skeptical law enforcement/government people. It's a sci-fi man on the run series, similar to Martin's classic The Fugitive, even created by Larry Cohen, who wrote some of the better Fugitive episodes.

So what sort of mayhem do the aliens cause in this first season? They're responsible for a plague of locusts attacking a Kansas farm town (""Nightmare""), they try to sabotage the U.S. space program (""Moonshot""), they cause serious tidal waves off the coast of Florida (""Storm"") and infiltrate a major communications plant (""The Condemned""), among other things. Through it all, Vincent remains a dogged, determined hero, out to stop the aliens from taking over the human race!

In addition to the 17 episodes featured here, there are a few bonus items. Thinnes himself appears before each episode, giving slight commentary about the episode and guest actors (even shamelessly plugging other shows on DVD from CBS like Mission: Impossible), and also gives a more in-depth interview as well. There are also a trio of network promos for the series, but the highlight would have to be the rare extended version of the pilot, with 15 minutes of extra footage. Definitely recommended!",1276646400,2,2437,4.781472684085511
3100819,4,B0012Z36EO,"Think ""The Fugitive"" meets ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and you can imagine the tone of this sci-fi show.  I loved it when it was on its 1st TV run and it stills holds up fairly well.  The special effects are of course quite dated but acceptable like the original Star Trek.  The tension and sense of foreboding are constant giving this series a good pace.  A worthwhile watch.",1271203200,2,381,4.478260869565218

3100821,3,B0012Z36EO,"When the TV series The Invaders came out I loved the concept of not being able to tell the bad guys from the good guys, such as in The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  It was scary and I probably saw every episode.  If you are one of those that loved the old program this is for you.  I bought both the season 1 and 2 DVDs, which is all there is.  The picture quality is excellent - far better than was possible to see on the TV sets of the day.  The only disappointment was the introduction by the star Roy Thinnes.  His comments might as well had been mailed in.  He seemed bored.  I had hoped for some inside comments on what went on during the making of the episodes, but there was little of that.  Nevertheless, if you enjoyed The Invaders as much as I did back in its time this is worth a revisit.",1252454400,2,803,4.031645569620253

3100833,5,B0012Z36EO,"Though I enjoyed both seasons of THE INVADERS, Season One is my favorite.  As with most first season shows, Season One of THE INVADERS is when the production team did some experimenting before it settled on a ""formula.""  As such the beginning of the season is fresher and a little more raw than the series' second year run.

In the first season David Vincent bears the burden of his crusade against the alien invasion alone. Although each show adds additional witnesses to alien activity, Vincent is seemingly the only one dedicated enough to give up his personal life, employment, and reputation in the pursuit of the aliens.  This is very different from Season Two where Vincent is a member of a larger organization of believers.

The plot:  Aliens from another galaxy have landed on Earth slowly establishing their network.  Their goal is to acquire the Earth as a replacment planet for their dying world.  The aliens have taken human form both to survive in the oxygen rich environment and to infiltrate society.  In the pilot episode ""Beachhead"" Architect David Vincent accidentally witnesses one of the alien landings and finds that no one believes him.  Worse is that police treat him as a kook and the aliens are out to do away with him all together.  Ultimately Vincent takes up his lonely pursuit of the aliens.  Vincent is played by handsome blue-eyed Roy Thinnes.  Thinnes had alreay appeared in several prior Quinn Martin television productions and ended up landing the starring role in THE INVADERS.

The pilot episode was a bit of a disappointment in that Vincent's initial encounter with the alien saucer is little more than what we are shown during the beginning credits, theme music, and narration.  In fact the beginning narration and credits of each episode show us the saucers traveling past the moon toward Earth, something that is never seen in the pilot.  Still it was a fitting beginning to the series.

In terms of infiltration the Invaders are certainly successful in that aliens are already well established -- in most cases the story lines give them at least a year of tenure -- in law enforcment, industry, the military and government agencies. In terms of their appearance we are only treated to the Invaders in human form.  We never see them in their original alien state.

There is no rhyme or reason for why the Invaders take one particular human form or another.  You would think they would be best served appearing as strapping young healthy men and women.  Instead the Invaders show up as young and elderly, heavy and petite, or any other common human forms.  Though the Invaders sometimes borrow the identity of a deceased individual it is more the case of identity theft than one-for-one replacment ala INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  In most cases the Invaders are experts at forging certificates, identification and other documents allowing them unimpeded access across the country.

One of the alien prime directives appears to be to prevent the general public from finding out about them.  As such the Invaders generally restrict themselves to standard firearms and make use of Earth-bound technology such as radios and rotary phones -- though I am sure there were production budgetary reasons as well.  When cornered the aliens will not hesitate to take their own lives to prevent their capture.  Episode three is the first episode where we witness the aliens incinerate when they are dying or badly wounded.  Thus when the aliens die they leave no trace behind.  Even the items they are carrying incinerate with them.

Each of the episodes are stand alone stories with conflict and resolution within each episode.  Though the aliens schemes are normally foiled by Vincent, sometimes it is difficult to determine the victor.  Season One has some great and very familiar guest stars, several who would appear again in Season Two as totally different characters.  Included in Season One are J.D. Cannon, Ellen Corby, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, William Windom, Jack Lord, Michael Rennie, James Whitmore, Burgess Meredith, Ralph Bellamy, Joseph Campenella, and others.

The DVD does feature a few special features such as audio commentary and optional introductions to each episode by a contemporary Roy Thinnes.  In the Thinnes introductions there was a missed opportunity in that the introductions are limited to a short synopsis of the episode highlighting the appearance of a guest star.  It would have been better to allow Thinnes to elaborate on behind the scenes aspects of each episode.  Season One is also limited to 17 episodes.  Remember that the first season of THE INVADERS was as a midseason replacement.  The second year was a full 26-season season.",1242432000,3,4713,5.001283697047497

And the only person standing in the way of their evil schemes. Is?.You guessed it,David Vincent. This five disc 17 episode DVD set takes us on a journey with David Vincent as we share his nightmare. In his fight against the invaders week after week. The episodes on this DVD set includes attacks by the invaders. On our space program,our nuclear program,the ecology system and even our weather. The Invaders was created by Larry Cohen and was a Quinn Martin production. And over the years has become a Sci-Fi icon and a classic TV show. This show use to give me nightmares. Along with its eerie music and a long list of noticeable guest stars like Roddy McDowall,Peter Graves,Suzanne Pleshette,Jack Lord and Joseph Campanella.

3100838,5,B0012Z36EO,"Do UFO's and little green men from other planets really exist? For David Vincent he's about to put his mental abilities to the ultimate test. Have alien creatures really come from their dying planet to inhabit the Earth and take over its unsuspecting citizens or are these the lunatic hallucinations of a man on the verge of insanity?

While traveling a desolate stretch of road one night David Vincent on the verge of falling asleep pulls off into a very remote area of the woods for a quick nap and witnesses something he can't believe is really happening. To David's surprise an alien spacecraft has in fact landed on Earth and at this point he is the only one who knows of their existence. He quickly realizes he must do something to tell the rest of the people, that the aliens have arrived. The only problem for David Vincent is that the aliens are aware he has seen them; he just doesn't know that they know. Welcome to ""The Invaders"" Season one.

From the creative genius of Larry Cohen, producer Quinn Martin and special thanks to Paramount Studios we have the first 16 episodes of this classic Sci-Fi television show to enjoy when ever we want. The overall quality of the first 16 episodes is pretty good as it appears the prints are from the 35mm prints and not the original source material. I'm no expert on this, it just seems like that's the case here. The episodes do suffer from dirt, debris and some graininess here and there, but not enough to detract from my viewing experience. This 5 disc single sided DVD set is well done and Paramount Studios should be commended for their efforts. My only complaint is that they split the set up into two volumes instead of a complete series release. Even with the quality issues I've raised, these episodes in my opinion have never looked better!

3100839,5,B0012Z36EO,"What a pleasure it is to have this series available on DVD at last! For those old enough to remember, David Vincent's lonely, never-ending battle to save humanity from secret alien invasion provided plenty of thrills & chills, especially if you were an impressionable child. And it's equally a pleasure to discover that it holds up very nicely, just as paranoid & frustrating as it ever was ... for David Vincent was truly a prophet without honor in his own land, generally mocked & dismissed by the very people he struggled to save. That haunted, unheralded aspect of the series always added an extra punch for me.

Yes, the special effects aren't so special by contemporary standards, and the overall storyline not as ""realistic."" But the special effects, though crude now, are still effective; and in any case, they're merely frosting on the cake. The same might be said about the ""unrealistic"" portions of the series -- just how did David Vincent support himself, and so on. TV shows of that era tended to have a heavier, more obviously symbolic content, and trusted in the imagination of the viewers to fill in some blanks. And those ""unrealistic"" gaps gave it an additional nightmarish quality that can still take a very cold grasp of your primal fears. While everything becomes dated in one sense, I've got a feeling that a great deal of contemporary TV, supposedly far more ""realistic,"" won't age as well as this series has ...

So open yourself up to a different style of storytelling, enter this waking nightmare, and keep an eye out for that deformed little finger -- the aliens are already here! And after all, isn't that what so many of us still fear today -- the Other who looks just like us, but isn't? It's a fear that's always current & relevant, and thus can never become dated, alas.

And the second season should be here shortly ...

To those who complain that the special effects seem primitive by today's standards, you must remember that this show was produced over 40 years ago. That was way before the days of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery). In 1967, a computer with same computing capacity of today's cell phone had a price tag of several million dollars!

But it is!

It's pretty basic science fiction, with inexpensive sets and what might be considered laughable effects. Sort of The Fugitive, with aliens. (Same producer did both.) But there's lots of familiar faces, fine acting, and some real issues that still prompt discussion today. There's real chills and suspense, and you'll never look at people's pinkies the same way again.

Another thing I didn't expect was the way my husband and I marveled at the way people lived in 1966. He makes calls from a pay phone! The cars are huge! The suits are baggy! They listen to records!

If you were a fan back when, ya gotta have. If you weren't, it's still a charming example of a thoughtful science fiction series at a time when this was very rare. Perhaps it paved the way for Star Trek.",1218672000,7,937,4.398843930635838

Transfer for DVD coul be better, but both sound and image are highly satisfactory. For the price they ask for it, it's a fair purchase.

There's only one unforgivable flaw, in my opinion: the lack of English subtitles for the hearing-impaired. I know there's a budget and a profit assingned to each product, but I think it's almost an offense to not inlude (at least) English subtitles.

1967, seventeen episodes, color, mono, approx 15-1/2 hours, five discs, 4:3, and CC... not subtitled. Two versions of the pilot episode... the second version is on the last DVD of this set... half a 'regular' season, since it was a replacement series for a cancellation.

There is also an -extra- version of 'The Innocent' on disk three, with a sometimes rambling commentary by the series creator, Larry Cohen... who was apparently marginalized, not really part of Quinn Martin Productions. Plus three promos.

3100860,4,B0012Z36EO,"About the Show:

Unlike the other two major television networks of the era, in the late 60's ABC had what it called a ""second season"" which premiered new shows in January.  One of the network's biggest hits was the campy ""Batman"" which premiered a year earlier in 1966.  ""The Invaders"" premiered as a part of the 1967 second season and immediately caught the attention of the television viewing public.

Produced by the legendary Quinn Martin (""The Untouchables,"" ""The FBI,"" ""The Fugitive"" and later ""Cannon"" and ""Barnaby Jones""), ""The Invaders starred Roy Thinnes as David Vincent, an architect that accidentally witnesses the landing of an alien spacecraft.  This sighting launches Vincent on a campaign to stop the alien invaders, either singlehandedly or with the aid of others that he convinces of the threat to humanity.

Each week Vincent goes to a different part of the country to do battle with the space invaders and somehow, within the confines of the show's hour-long format, he manages to thwart their plans.

Naturally, the aliens try to do Mr. Vincent in but somehow he manages to escape certain death.

Thinnes brings believability in his role of a man determined to protect humanity from the other worldly menace, a man that will do all within his power to bring down the alien menace.

Boy, he must have some really deep pockets in order to travel all over, never appearing to actually work at his architectural firm.  Only In the pilot episode (""Beachhead""), along with ""The Innocent""), is there even the hint of his design skills.

The show does not rely heavily on special effects, dealing more with character interaction and some really intriguing situations for the hero and his encounters.

One of the series' strengths is the quality of the writing and the line-up of guest stars, many familiar and some on amazing up-and-comers.

The guest list reads like a ""who's who"" of character actors of the 60's, 70's, and 80's: the ubiquitous Alfred Ryder, Louise Latham, John Larch, Jeanette Nolan, Andrew Duggan, Irene Tedrow, Phillip Pine, Robert Emhardt, Milton Selzer, William Talman, Susan Oliver of ""Star Trek"" Orion slave girl fame, the eternally youthful Barbara Luna, Robert Walker (""Star Trek's"" Charlie X), Murray Matheson, Murray Hamilton, Harold Gould, Lloyd Gould, Joanne Linville, R.G. Armstrong, William Smithers, Paul Carr, Frank Marth, Harry Lauter, Ford Rainey, Richard X. Slattery, Barney Phillips, John McLiam, Kent Smith, the dependable Strother Martin (""Cool Hand Luke""), Edward Andrews, Ross Elliott, and Wesley Addy. Each greatly delivers to the stories that intertwine Vincent's quest to uncover the alien threat and his interactions with unsuspecting citizens along with the malevolent aliens.

Guest stars that had yet made their jump to stardom or greater familiarity in shows of their own or movies include Jack Lord (one year shy of his ""Hawaii 5-0"" triumph), Peggy Lipton (""The Mod Squad"" and future wife of Quincy Jones), Suzanne Pleshette (""The Bob Newhart Show""), Simon Scott (""Trapper John, M.D.""), Peter Graves (""Mission: Impossible""), future Emmy winners Ed Asner (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), William Windom  (""My World and Welcome to It""), James Whitmore (""The Practice""), Jack Warden (""Brian's Song""), Burgess Meredith (""Tail Gunner Joe""), and Ellen Corby (""The Waltons""),as well as Arthur Hill (""Owen Marshall""), a very young Dabney Coleman (""9 to 5""), Dabbs Greer (Reverend Walden on ""Little House on the Prairie""), and Norman Fell (""Three's Company"")

Actors accustomed to appearing on both the big and small screen that get involved with David Vincent are Roddy McDowall (""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Fright Night,"" ""National Velvet""), Diane Baker (""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Marnie""),Oscar winner Ed Begley (""Sweet Bird of Youth""), Susan Strasberg  (""Picnic,"" ""Rollercoaster""),  Michael Rennie (""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""The Lost World,"" ""Hotel,"" ""Island in the Sun""), Ralph Bellamy (""Sunrise at Campobello,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Trading Places""),

Incidentally, Ryder, Addy, Rennie, Luna, Matheson, and Nancy Wickmore deliciously chew the scenery as alien leaders, respectively in the episodes ""Vikor,"" ""Doomsday Minus One,"" ""The Innocent,"" ""Storm,"" ""The Ivy Curtain,"" and ""The Betrayed,""

""Storm"" also boasts an intriguing religious slant pitting a priest torn between his faith and the fate of the world with a great performance from Joseph Campanella, later to star on ""Mannix"" with Mike Connors.

Another of the show's strengths is the music provided by composer Dominic Frontiere.  Frontiere had already endeared himself to sci-fi fans for his fantastic music for the first season of the classic ""The Outer Limits.""

Besides the obvious (fashion, cars, haircuts, etc.), one of the show's aspects that dates it is the use of the term ""girl"" for the featured women in the respective episodes.

This show was definitely pre-woman's lib.

Also, most Quinn Martin shows featured a disclaimer at the end announcing that cars were provided by the Ford Motor Company and ""The Invaders"" is no different.

What an understatement!  A caf scene has no less than five Fords of various vintage parked in front.  Another had cars going up the street...all of `em Fords.

About the compilation's features:

Each episode can be played with or without an explanatory intro by Thinnes.  There is also a commentary by creator Larry Cohen that can be optionally heard during the viewing of ""The Innocent.""
The extended version of the pilot offers a few more details that don't necessarily add to the storyline; thus, it's no wonder that they were deleted from the version aired in '67.

The interview of Thinnes demands much patience because the actor tends to babble a little but he does provide some interesting insight into the production of the two-season series.

Because of that interview and Cohen's rather mundane commentary track, the five-star series loses a star for the DVD compilation.",1215993600,4,5947,5.265889830508475

3100876,4,B0012Z36EO,I have never seen this show before this release and its been great! the stories are good and overtake the 60's special effects. Highly recommended!,1215129600,,147,4.92
3100877,4,B0012Z36EO,"I was 9 when The Invaders came out.  I didn't get to see the first episode, nor see it every week, but at that age, I loved all things Sci-Fi.  We still had Star Trek at the time.  The Invaders was so creepy to me that aliens were here and seemed to run most everything and I loved it.  David Vincent worked alone to stop them, a superhero with no super powers.  Since I was so young, I got outvoted on a lot of shows and didn't get to see many that ""I"" wanted.  But I remembered the few episodes of The Invaders I saw . . . and that awesome show intro-- each week with the landing spacecraft and David Vincent's glowing face, looking in wonder. Since The Invaders didn't go into syndication there were no reruns.  I have remembered 40 long years.

Fast forward to 2008.  Now I am 50, and still never got to see that 1st Episode.  When I saw the DVDs were coming out I could hardly wait.  When the DVDs came out I bought the set and finally watched that 1st episode.  Roy Thinnes is very believable as David Vincent.

Watching the shows, I was impressed at how well the show progressed, advancing the plots that could have become VERY formula driven.  The first few were like this, but after about the 4th episode things started to change and I believe this show holds up very well.  There are Guest Stars galore -- and excellent ones.  Famous 60's and 70's and current biggies, too.  That makes the show better with great actors, that sometimes overshadow the not-so great storylines that happened sometimes.

A nice interview with Roy Thinnes is included - He seems like a nice man and I wish he could have been seen more on screen all these years.

WARNING:  DON'T WATCH THE ROY THINNES INTROS WITHOUT SEEING THE EPISODES FIRST -- HE GIVES OUT MANY SPOILERS!!!!  Watch them after you see an episode or disc.

In summation, the set is really good -- not loaded with extras but some good ones.  The look of the video is exceptional, especially for a 40+ year old show. The acting is great and Roy Thinnes makes the main character very sympathetic and enjoyable.

Back then the Aliens needn't to show their original form (although in one of the episodes we got a small hint) to intrigue my senses, I believe that leaving that to own's imagination adds even more suspense to this unique watching experience. I particularly enjoyed the second episode (The Experiment, guest star none other than Roddy McDowell!), definetely a Classic. I have to mention that for being a 1960's TV series, it had some decent effects for the era and the nail-biting suspense combined by the excellent actors of the day, this is surely a gem to watch.

Well I broke down and purchased ""The Invaders"" and this review is coming from someone who had never seen one episode of this show.

1. After watching ""Beach Head"", I was slightly disappointed in the writing and directing. The way David Vincent gets out of jams seems unrealistic at times.
2. I am at this time watching the last episode on disc 1 call ""The Leeches"" ! The color seems to go from excellent to kinda fuzzy.

3. This show is slowly growing on me and I may change my rating later.

3100899,5,B0012Z36EO,"Ah, the 60's in America--the cold war, space race, Vietnam, alien abductions, flying saucer sightings, and The Invaders.  What could be scarier than alien invaders with sinister intent, using a small disk with blinking lights that causes death to the unwitting (or unwilling) when held on the back of their neck.  Of course, it had to be held there by a human looking alien, except for the one finger sticking out on their hands (no, not that finger!) so we could tell them apart from the good guys.

And so it began one mysterious, foggy night when David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) looks for a shortcut and finds a flying saucer instead.

I have to admit, I loved this series.  During high school I avidly read all the UFO related books out there, went to a lecture or two, watched every schlocky '50's alien movie I can't tell you how many times, and couldn't wait to see how Vincent would both defeat and be defeated by the bad aliens each and every week.

The series was produced by Quinn Martin, famous for such series as The Fugitive, The FBI, 12 O'Clock High, Cannon, Barnaby Jones, etc.  But think of The Invaders as the Fugitive in reverse! Instead of searching for a one-armed man, Vincent knows there's plenty of aliens around--just look at their straight fingers and sinister expressions--but they thwart his attempts to expose them every week!  He's chasing them, instead of being chased.  Go figure!

But, hey--it was good TV then and it's GREAT TV now!  The set includes all of the episodes from the first season, 17 in all.  The bonus disk includes a lengthy interview with Roy Thinnes, an extended version of the pilot episode, ""Beachhead;"" and 3 of the first season promo pieces.

Some great guest stars in these shows, many prior to becoming real stars, and a few quirky almost typecast character actors, as well.  For example, I recognized the actor who played Spock's rival in ""Amok Time"" playing an alien henchman in the first two episodes of the Invaders!

You can choose to play an introduction from Roy Thinnes before each episode, if you wish.  Some of them offer behind the scenes trivia about the episode and series, special effects and obstacles they had to overcome in production.

It's well worth owning, even if you're not paranoid.  And the music is by Dominic Frontiere--one of the most gifted composers of TV and movie music in history--the Invaders them is still contemporary today, holding its own against the techno, syntho, whatever electronic crapola pop theme you want to throw against it.

OK, why are you looking at me like that?  And what's that disk you have in your hand?  Um...about that finger you can't straighten--you're making me nervous.  Very nervous!

Guess I'll wait for the next DVD set or two to see how the series really turns out.  Seriously, I'm not climbing this ladder into any disk shaped object with you, no matter what.  So just go back inside and report back to Area 51, where you belong!

With the technologies of today and because of the popular demand the show was produced on DVD.  I purchased this for two reasons 1: The great reviews posted here on Amazon and 2:  My interest for great Sci-Fi.

I must say after watching the entire Season 1 on DVD I was not disappointed!

Here are the reasons to own this wonderful DVD:
-------------------------------------------------
1.  Excellent quality- The reproduction on DVD is super clear. Considering the show was produced in the 1960's, the color and clarity are awesome!

2.  Engaging storyline- The premise of the show and every episode was done with alot of creativity and supports the show's storyline/premise very well.  Each episode has a feel as if it can stand alone as a mini-movie.  The show is broken down into 4 Acts and an Epilogue (ending, summary).  Well done with the segments!

3.  Great acting and well-known superstars-Roy Thinnes as the main character suits the show perfectly and his acting couldn't have been done better by any other actor.  Alot of actors made appearances on episodes in Season 1 like Vanessa Redgrave, and other actors. I would name more actors/actresses but its more a suprise seeing who appears on that episode as its playing.

4.  Great extras- Interview with Roy Thinnes, optional introduction by him available for each episode, ""Beachhead"" Extended Pilot Episode ( Disregard the fact that this may not have been the longer one that was produced). Other reviewers knock this for not being included, but no one is perfect!, and 3 Season 1 promos.

Reason to not own this DVD:
---------------------------

ABSOLUTELY NOT A SINGLE REASON!!!

This show is a must owned DVD for any true Sci-fi fan.  Considering the lack of the crazy technology and high tech products that are produced in today's day and age, the producers and creators did a wonderful job of the laser gun and disappearing of the aliens when killed.

This show set a precedent of all sci-fi shows of today. Shows like the X-Files wouldn't have been possible had it not been for this show.

A true 5-star rating and own it today!

I will certainly purchase Season 2 when it eventually becomes available.",1213315200,4,2349,4.802992518703242

The Invaders was one of the two Sci-Fi TV series which I remembered most from my early teen years - the other being The Time Tunnel.  I received The Invaders DVD's last week, while The Time Tunnel (both volumes) had been in my collection for over a year now.  My little comment is thus on a comparison between the two.

Both releases faithfully bring back the episodes; the stories, the background music/noise, and the mood I recalled having enjoyed. Being able to hear and watch Roy Thinnes in person again is very nice.  David Vincent; being the sole character working often alone in many of the episodes, however, does make him kind of lonely in the interview.  The Time Tunnel, managed to get hold of more of the crew: Doug Philips, Tony Newman and Ann MacGregor, made a more happy reunion.

While it might be icing on the cake, the availability of subtitle in The Time Tunnel would, I believe, allows more senior and less privileged people to enjoy the show more fully.  It is one thing I always want to see with new DVD releases.

If you liked the ""X-Files"" you'll love this show. This is one of my favourite TV shows of all time.
The show follows the exploits of architect David Vincent who one night on a lonely road witnesses the landing of a space craft. Of course even his closest friend doesn't believe him and soon after he finds out,much to his amazement,that the aliens are among us and are trying to take over the earth. He goes from episode to episode trying to find and defeat the aliens any which way he can and trying to convince a skeptical public of what he knows. He makes headway little by little gaining some converts here and there but knows he can't stop until the entire world knows the truth of what is happening.
The show had high production values throughout and Roy Thinnes who plays David Vincent is superb in his role. He is also more than ably supported by top notch stars and a myriad of supporting actors in every episode. As in the ""X-Files"",this show also maintains that constant atmosphere of tension and dread every moment which made the show so appealing in 1967 and still does today.
It is interesting to note the special effects used throughout the series. The biggies were the landing and taking off the space craft and the
death of the aliens themselves,who would dissolve in a sea of red. Other effects were minimalistic but VERY effective. For example the human appearing aliens would often have to regenerate themselves,if they didn't they would start glowing. To enhance this aspect the actors would raise their hands to their faces which held,unseen in their palms,a light which would enhance the glowing. Other small things like dressing in blue cover-alls or dark suits,or the way the actors portraying aliens would give a simple but solemn look. The mutated fourth finger which caused their pinkies to stick out was also a very simple thing to achieve. All these things and more simply enhanced the feel and look of the show.
Each epsiode was done in four acts with an epilog and had a spoken intro and final wrap up dialogue at the end. The series music was done by none other than Dominic Frontiere well know for his work on the original""Outer Limits"".
Looking on the technical side of things we unfortunately find a bit of a let down,which is why the four star rating.
First this show is NOT remastered but definitely should have been. These were transferred from existing masters and the earlier eps especially show major colour differences/deficiencies associated with film that old. The transfer is adequate and fairly crisp but a good remastering from the original film elements with colour correction(much needed in parts where the colour is washed out or faded)and a good clean up would have made these look beautiful,like the great job done on""The Wild,Wild West"" series. For example some shows like ""The Time Tunnel"" have not been remastered either,but look incredibly clean and crisp as if they had been. Others not remastered but BADLY needing it are shows like ""McHale's Navy"" and ""The Addams Family"".It all depends in what shape the masters are in.
Secondly,and more disturbing, is the teeny tiny fine print on the back of the DVD case which says:""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"".This could mean ALOT of things. I looked closely at each one. Two things I found stand out. Any signs with a brand name product on it have been blurred out;and the end credit has been changed to reflect the new ownership of this product to Spelling Entertainment(2008) replacing the old Quinn Martin logo and date. There are many incidents of incidental music throughout these eps also and considering the way many companies these days,for some reason,seem to be replacing what was on there originally with a newer score,this MAY also be another area of editing.
Considering that this set hasn't been remastered I doubt very much whether the second and last season will be either. But I hope that the format this one has follows into the next. That is,Roy Thinnes himself is there to introduce each and every episode in his own inimitable fashion! It was a surprise but a REAL joy to see him on screen and see that he is looking very well. As an aside I recall that Mr. Thinnes after the show ended became very popular on the UFO convention circuit. The mid-60s was witness to a huge UFO flap and this show attracted many of those who witnessed and believed in the phenomenon. They could identify with the character who was always at constant odds with a disbelieving authority.
Also included in this set are special commentary tracks,an interview with Roy Thinnes(which I can't wait to see) and the rare extended pilot version of the first ep ""Beachhead"".The latter contains alot of deleted and extended scenes the originally aired version doesn't and is ultimately the better and more satisfying of the two. A great edition to the set.
In conclusion this the progenitor of the ""X-Files"",which has finally made it to DVD(a 5-disc set),will not disappoint anyone interested in that show,old fans of ""The Invaders"",the alien angle or just good Sci-Fi drama period. It made a huge impact on a lot of people,including myself, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. It is a shame that it was not remastered and cleaned up the way it should have been but the prints here are adequate and fairly crisp.

3100918,5,B0012Z36EO,"I was in junior high the year the series started (it was the same season that the original Star Trek began.) Lost in Space had begun the year before, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea the year before that, and around that time The Time Tunnel also appeared. My friends and I would talk about the show enthusiastically the next day after each new episode. I hadn't seen a single episode since it went off the air in 1968.

I've now seen the first season which was just released on DVD. I find these to be quite enjoyable. The stories were interesting (for the most part), the effects stand up just fine even in today's world of CGI, and the acting cannot be beat.

Roy Thinnes, playing the lead character, does an excellent job as a man trying to find irrefutable evidence of the presence and intent of the invading aliens. Many of the guest stars were top names in that day. Even the background character actors are well-recognized by anyone familiar with TV in the 1960's. The show made creative use of many photogenic locales in the L.A. area though of course studio sets were also utilized.

I thought the writers made the stories more believable by having credible characters believe Vincent (Thinnes' character) and even try to help him or work with him. Vincent endeavors to get official recognition and intervention, but at times has to settle for minor victories over these creatures.

One of the credited story creators (Cohen) provides a commentary on one episode.  Unfortunately, much of what he says relates to his resume of other shows and experiences having nothing to do with The Invaders. I think it would have worked much better to have Thinnes provide a commentary for at least a few of these. It's always fun to hear little anecdotes and trivia that only someone on the set can provide.

I thought most of the episode transfers were ""good"", though not as consistently clear and pristine as I've seen with other sci-fi shows from the 60's that made it onto DVD. Still, they tracked down the original pilot in a longer version and have included that among bonus features. Also, there is a great interview with Mr. Thinnes and he briefly introduces each episode.

Overall, I'm ecstatic they have released this series on DVD. It is a slice of Americana from the 1960's. Watching all those beautiful old cars (when they were new!) and styles and fashions from that period was very nostalgic. I don't think you'll regret buying the set. I look forward to the release of the next season.",1212451200,,2497,4.661363636363636
3100919,5,B0012Z36EO,"Other reviewers have already done a great job of describing the basics about this DVD set, so I'll focus on one aspect that really hasn't been covered yet.

If there is one component of the Invaders that played a pivotal role in making it not only one of the most frightening TV shows of the 60's but also the most memorable and quite honestly perhaps one the very best, it would have to be the theme music.

Having now watched some of the season 1 box set, it has been brought all back again after not being viewed for such a long time. And the theme music by Dominic Frontiere truly set this series apart from almost everything else at the time.

Not coincidentally, one of the other most frightening tv shows of this time period was ""The Outer Limits"" also scored by Dominic Frontiere.
The music of course is quite eerie but also draws you into the deep horror that is felt by the main characters. It makes the events on screen effect the viewer in a much more compelling way. It places you right there with the events as they unfold. I think because Frontiere is so sparse with the music. Just a few notes is all it takes. Long drawn out chords but deftly placed and never overplayed. Deep bass strings and horns can always set the proper mood for horror and sci-fi. Understated, subdued yet incredibly powerful yet never overpowering what is seen on the screen. Dominic Frontiere certainly sets the mood properly and makes this one of the most unforgettable shows you'll ever watch.

Not many other TV series are better than this one. We've all waited so long for the ""The Invaders"" to finally return to earth. And bringing the stories the characters and that great music back to us, after so long unheard but ALWAYS remembered.",1212364800,6,1733,4.527156549520766

I also like the colors used & this is one Sci-fi show where the special effects takes a back seat to the excellent scripts. It's like a combination of the TV show ""The Fugitive"" with a weekly plot like ""Hill Street Blues."" All I can say is when is the next release of this series due out? HURRY PLEASE!!!""

Second, the cast of guest actors/actresses is great. Mostly familiar faces later seen in motion pictures.

Third, a lot of the filming is outdoors in various locations instead of mostly indoors, on sets, or the LA area, like Mission Impossible and some of the others.

3100922,4,B0012Z36EO,"I rate this excellent DVD box set four stars for being an outstanding video transfer.  I am enjoying viewing these DVD's on a modern large screen HDTV played by an upward compatible DVD player. This is a much better viewing experience than watching THE INVADERS on an old B&W set in the late 60's.  The picture is crisp, the colors are vibrant and the sound is excellent.

I was an addict of the THE INVADERS TV series during my third year in engineering school and even stood up to the college crowd which was in love with STAR-TREK, the newest sci-fi series.  I felt that STAR-TREK was just another of the popular TV fads with the college crowd (e.g., BATMAN). However, I was soon to be a convert as I found that THE INVADERS was always going places but never really getting anywhere.  Week after week we saw similar plots on THE INVADERS and after a while it started to grow a little thin.

When real boredom set in, and after some prodding by my college friends I had to turn the dial to see STAR TREK, which was aired during an overlapping time slot. After sampling the different interesting themes that were explored by STAR TREK I had to admit that THE INVADERS was worth giving up.  However, I would have continued watching THE INVADERS in hopes of some progress if only it had it been aired during a different time slot.

I still enjoyed THE INVADERS, and hope to see the second season box set available before too long.  By the time the second season came along in the late 60's I was too busy watching STAR TREK to care.  However, I may be able to catch it the second time around in a DVD release.

On the commentary side, THE INVADERS comes from an earlier more innocent era when Air Force Intelligence, the FBI and our CIA were always considered to be the good guys in films, out fighting for truth and justice in addition to our national security.

UPDATE - Recently, while watching an INVADERS episode I never saw on TV entitled ""Innocent"" I was surprised to learn that its script could have been used as the basis of the X-Files episode ""TBD"".  MORE TO COME.",1212105600,,2074,4.426315789473684
3100923,4,B0012Z36EO,"THE INVADERS, Season One has been quite an anticipated release on DVD.  It's rarely been seen on American TV since the '60s and is fondly remembered by those who saw the original run on ABC.

The producers of this DVD set almost got it all right.  They got Roy Thinnes to do episode introductions and an interview; they included some original network promos and bumpers; and they found and included a 60-minute unaired version of the pilot episode, which contains additional and expanded scenes, fleshing out the story and its periferal characters.

What's wrong here is the time-sped version of the aired pilot (and only that episode).  All of the others are at the correct speed.  There's also some questionable film elements used.  Episode 4, ""The Leeches"", for example has a small section of the episode that looks sourced from a 16mm print.  As such, the release comes off as looking rushed - not quite finished to perfection.

Other than that, it's a good release, and it should be a welcome addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1212019200,6,1034,4.829545454545454

SPOILERS:

Architect David Vincent(Roy Thinnes)stops to rest after a long drive back from a meeting with a client when he witnesses an alien spacecraft land in the middle of nowhere. When he reports it to the local police he's treated with distain  by a detective (the wonderful character actor J.D. Cannon)and finds that even his own business partner (James Daly) has a hard time believing him. They encounter a couple on their honeymoon who completely discount Vincent's account of the landing. Going back to the site to speak with the couple again Vincent discovers that they are aliens themselves and part of a large conspiracy that has infiltrated every part of our society.

END OF SPOILERS:

We get some very cool extras that fans will enjoy. On the last disc is the long missing 60 minute pilot episode. While it doesn't look quite as good as the series itself with faded colors, it still looks surprisingly good without any restoration. The longer pilot had a number of brief scenes that were cut prior to the airing of the show including a slightly different ending.

Roy Thinnes provides an introduction to each episode including the unaired pilot. He also sits for a nearly 30 minute interview discussing how he became involved with the show, the numerous guest stars he worked with (he essentially was the only regular on the show (aside from the unseen episode narrator William Woodson and introductory narrator Hank Simms)as he was always traveling to uncover hot spots where the invaders were up to no good). Characters did show up in multiple episodes but Thinnes carries the show.

It's easy to see where ""The X-Files"" got its inspiration from. Thinnes praises the writers for the show as well as the directors (the first two episodes where directed by TV and film veteran Joseph Sargant who does a terrific job of setting up shots with cinematographer Andrew MacIntyre creating moody and magnificient atmosphere during the first episodes that rival ""The Outer Limits"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" at their best.

We also get three promo spots produced by ABC for the series. The promos are essentially clip jobs with narration describing the series. They are still very nice to have in this set.

Thinnes also discusses everything from the challenge of creating aliens that burn up on demand to shooting on location. He also shares a story that I haven't heard before about seeing a UFO himself with his wife shortly before the show aired.

Larry Cohen's commentary on ""The Innocent"" is quite good. He shares production stories, ideas he had for the second season that didn't come to fruitation including giving Vincent a sense of humor and a life outside his pursuit of the aliens.

The first season set looks exceptionally good given the age of the series. Although images are a bit soft the color is surprisingly strong and bold. During the episode ""The Leeches"" there was a brief but very noticable drop in image quality and it looked as if the producers had to use a dupe several generations away from the original. There's occasional bits of specs that show up but that's not really a surprise given the age of the show. It doesn't effect the quality of the set either way. The mono audio sounds really good with dialogue crystal clear. Interestingly, series composer Dominic Frontier who also did the music for the first season of ""The Outer Limits"" cannibalizes music from that series for the pilot episode.

Often seen as a Cold War metaphor, ""The Invaders"" is far more than that. The writing is superb and the episodes resonate because of the skilled direction and exceptional, believable lead performance by Thinnes. While it would be a stretch to say this series had a ""story arc"" like most modern TV shows, there is a sketchy one which is that Vincent sets out to find proof and expose the invaders. They, in turn, want to eliminate him because he's one of the few crusaders trying to uncover their plot to take over our world.

Overall Paramount/CBS has done a superb job bringing this classic series to TV. I'm surprised at how well it has held up with most of the writing/direction/acting top notch. Featuring well known guest stars such as William Windom, Harold Gould, Roddy MacDowell, Suzanne Pleshette, Ed Begley, Dabney Coleman and Michael Rennie during its brief two year run, ""The Invaders"" was an exceptionally good series with cool visual effects but, more importantly, well written stories that could drawn an audience into the world of David Vicent.

I'm hoping that the second season set will see the 1995 TV mini-series that starred Scott Bakula included (although that did have a separate home video release) and, perhaps, we can get more interview time with Thinnes about shooting season two.",1211587200,24,5133,4.925925925925926
3100925,5,B0012Z36EO,"I have updated my review of THE INVADERS.

The film transfers appear to be from 35mm positive prints, rather than the original negatives.  There is some grain & too much film dust.
The episodes have been slightly sped up to run 49 minutes instead of 51 minutes.  The theory is that these are from the European PAL transfers where their projectors run at 25 frames per second (as opposed to our 24 frames stretched to 30).  Roy Thinnes says this show is very popular in France where it is in syndication.  This is probably the source material.

Still, these look better than they originally did on first airing.

The 27:25 long interview with Roy Thinnes is very informative, giving us insight on how he got involved with the series & some of his memories with the other actors.
BUT I would suggest not watching the individual show intros that he does as he talks about the plot of the episode, and gives no insight about its production.  I think it is better to let the episodes tell the story first, then watch the intro after.

-Original Review-

Some reviewers here talked about the poor region 2 DVD case.  I want to re-assure U.S. buyers that the region 1 case does NOT have overlapping discs. The slightly thicker keepcase has two swinging holders inside that store two discs on opposite sides of each other.  The 5th disc is stored on the inside back of the case.

The clear case has a two-sided insert that gives the episode information (showing through the clear case) on the inside of the case.

There are 5 single-sided discs.
The 17 episodes have new introductions by Roy Thinnes. ***SKIP OVER THIS INTRO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE EPISODES*** .  Roy just gives you some of the plot and no insite about the making of the episode.
Disclaimer on the back:""Some Episodes may be altered from their original network versions"".  This is generic and does not give specific information, and it does not say they actually are edited.  I have nothing to compare the episodes to.

The episodes are COMPLETE, running 49 minutes each.  Not cut down 45 minute syndication versions as some have rumored.

I did a quick view of a disc 5 episode WALL OF CRYSTAL and am happy to report that CBS retained the original ""COMING UP NEXT: THE INVADERS, IN COLOR"" introduction bumper!  The transfers are crisp & the colors well balanced. The only time I noticed film dust was during the process matte shots, and this is inherent in the negative from when the special effects were done.

However the transfer of the next episode has dust appearing quite frequently, so the quiality varies.

The episodes are broken up into chapters so that you can quit at any commercial break and quickly jump to the next segment when you are ready to watch again.  There is a mute Invaders bumper at the end where the original sponsorship would have been announced.  The ABC logo at the end has been replaced with a CBS logo (not a CBS Paramount logo).

The three season 1 promos show what the series would look like un-restored, a little grainy with negative dust.

Of Note, Roy makes a comment at the end of his interview about the popularity of THE INVADERS in France, where it is syndicated on television.",1211241600,39,3992,4.470994475138122
3100926,3,B0012Z36EO,"This show has only seen a limited, and incomplete
release before on a series of 12 VHS tapes by
""Goodtimes"" in 1988. There was one episode per tape,
each of varying print quality. The order of the
episodes on tape was seemingly random, and based more
on who the guest stars for the episode might be rather
than series continuity. The tapes were only released
in extended play mode, which when combined with poor
quality prints did not make for a pretty picture.

This new DVD set is an improvement over the VHS tapes,
but that's not saying too much. Judging from the two
episodes I've watched ( the first episode, ""Beachhead""
and ""The Experiment"" ) I would guess that these
episodes have been converted from the masters created
for the British releases. I base this supposition on
the fact that the soundtracks are pitched up slightly
faster than the American tapes; a common occurence due
to the different frame rate between PAL and NTSC.

The prints are better than the ones used for the VHS
releases, but are not neccesarily of consistent
quality. They are definitely NOT newly struck prints
from the original negatives, nor has there been any
digital clean-up done. The soundtracks are simple mono
which means that, on the positive side, there has been
no untoward monkeying around with the audio. On the
negative side ( or positive, if you're into nostalgia ),
this gives you about the same quality of sound as
you might have heard if you saw these episodes in
syndication.

Comparing my old ""Goodtimes"" VHS copy with the DVD
version of the second episode ( ""The Experiment"" ).
there do not appear to be any noticeable syndication
cuts. BUT BE WARNED; In microscopic type on the back
of the DVD case there is a disclaimer which reads,
""Some episodes may be edited from their original
network editions"". I have my suspicions that the
episode version of ""Beachhead"" may be one of those
that are""...edited from their original network
versions"", which is truly unforgiveable in a
commercial DVD release.

One positive bonus to this set is that a copy of the
full 60 minute pilot version of ""Beachhead"" was
located and included on disc five. The pilot version
contains about fifteen minutes of footage not in the
broadcast version. Entire scenes that were excised are
included, as well as a different end title sequence.
Also of note is some differing footage of a disguised
alien starting to glow as his rejuvenation time
approches. The shots included in the pilot, while
definitely filmed at the same time as the aired
version, might have been considered slightly more
unsettling to television viewers back in the sixties,
so the more subdued shots with the alien's hands
partially blocking his face were inserted ( this is
just my own theory, but I must admit that I was caught
off guard by the original footage, which seemed a bit
creepier to me - although VERY tame, by today's
standards ).

Another nice bonus are three vintage series promos,
plus episode intros by - and an interview with -
series star Roy Thinnes ( although it tends to ramble
a bit, and doesn't provide a whole lot of in-depth
info on the making of the series ).

This DVD set is far from perfect and will be somewhat
disappointing to those hoping for a loving restoration
of the episodes, but it is better than nothing
( especially for someone like me, who never got to see
the show when it originally aired, or even during it's
short run on the Sci FI Channel during the early '90s ).
So if you're interested in the series I can definitely
recommend the set, but if you're looking for the ultimate
version, this ain't it ( but sadly, it's probably the best
we're gonna get ).",1211068800,23,3653,4.6645962732919255

3100931,5,B0012Z36EO,"This is one of the best Science fiction series to ever be on TV. The problem was, it was years ahead of it's time. American audiences just weren't into the sci-fi thing in the age of westerns in the mid-sixties. For its time, this show was every bit as good as the X-Files were in the nineties. Produced by Quinn Martin, the man who produced great hit series as ""The Fugitive"" and ""The FBI"" it should have been a hit. Today it is a cult classic. Roy Thinnes portrayal is similar to David Janssen's Fugitive, as one man on a mission. Thinnes character architect David Vincent, while driving late one night sees a Alien ship landing. He begins his quest to tell the world. The problem is that the aliens have taken human form and are very intelligent. The only way to tell them from humans is a deformity on some of the aliens which is a pinky finger that will not bend with the rest of the fingers. The aliens do not bleed and they incinerate after being killed. On a limited 60's TV budget the special effects are not outstanding, but its the brilliant acting that makes the show. Great actors like James Daly, Jack Lord, and Suzanne Pleshette. For those who have never seen this show it is worth the effort to buy it. Enjoy!",1206316800,4,1225,4.37719298245614
3100932,5,B0012Z36EO,"The 42 one-hour episodes of the science fiction series ""The Invaders"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1967-1968.  That might seem like just one season but the series was a midseason replacement, which premiered in January 1967.  The season one DVD set includes only the 16 episodes produced to fill out the remainder of ABC's 1966-67 broadcast season.

Like ""The Prisoner"" which also premiered in 1967,  ""The Invaders"" has become a mega cult hit over the years and this DVD package is greatly anticipated.  The series has its roots in 1950's paranoia science fiction, specifically those films (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""It Came From Outer Space"", ""Invasion From Mars"") that were surrogates for the anti-Communist hysteria that swept the country during the early Eisenhower era.

""The Invaders"" took up the old theme of finding the enemy in our midst and was a worthy successor to the classic anti-Communist series ""I Led Three Lives""  (1953-1956).  But the anti-Red phobia was no longer a draw by 1967 so the series confined itself to aliens from outer space and drew few parallels to those folks from behind the Iron Curtain.  It did exploit the growing distrust of American business and government leaders by showing alien infiltration of these sectors.

Ray Thinnes plays architect David Vincent who stumbles across a spacecraft of disembarking aliens one night.  They are from a dying planet and have come to colonize the earth.  Their strategy is to infiltrate society by taking the form of humans, but like the robots of ""Westworld"" they have a little problem with their hands (or in this case with a bent pinky finger).  They also have no heartbeat as a consequence of having no heart.  And when they die their bodies rapidly evaporate, leaving no trace for Vincent to prove his claims to the authorities.

Vincent becomes a latter day Paul Revere, riding around trying to spread the alarm to a citizenry that dismiss him as a nut case.  He is never able to bring physical proof of his claims to anyone important.  The aliens do not kill him because his death might make his story more believable so they monitor his activities and do their best to thwart his various schemes.

Each episode was structured as a four-act play with commercial breaks between acts and an epilogue. Quinn Martin regular William Conrad provided a narration.  Conrad also did narration for ""The Fugitive"".  During its run ""The Invaders"" became more and more like ""The Fugitive"" because the original concept offered the writers no where else to go.  There were only so many ways Vincent could fail to warn people of the aliens and should he successfully convince the world of the invasion the series would end.  So like Richard Kimble he becomes a man on the run who episodically meets up with new people each week.  This takes away from the original idea of an alien invasion.

The acting is generally first rate and the music lively and distinctive.  Production design is standard Quinn Martin, the occasional sci-fi devices are meant to be taken seriously and are not the self-parody stuff of 1960's sci-fi series like ""Lost In Space"" and ""The Time Tunnel"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1205625600,7,3206,4.878003696857671

I loved this show, it followed after the old Star Trek went off and I needed to fill the void in the non-cable times of only three networks and this was fab-u-lous!  What was really great was it did not utilize a lot of gimmicks, and there was no c.g. effects  Good acting, suspense filled camera work, and bad guys who were bad!

However, when it comes to ""The Invaders"" well that show still is one that I remember fondly.  I have often wondered why they have never released more episodes when they were releasing the VHS version.  Well anyway it has been a long time in the making, but it is finally coming out.  I have waited for this show for a long time and I am glad that I will now be able to watch all of the episodes that are availible.  It is a shame that they left so many TV series and other shows hanging to where it always left a nagging question of what happened.  Never a conclusion so we could have closure.

3100935,5,B0012Z36EO,"The Invaders would definitely be at or near the top of the list of television shows that ended way before their time. That list has many science fiction series on it (the original Star Trek being one among many), but this series stands out because of its great production values (for the time), great performances, and the air of paranoia that shows like this must have to be believable.

Roy Thinnes played David Vincent, an otherwise ordinary fellow, an architect by profession, who happens to make the horrible discovery that we have been invaded by beings from another planet who have taken the appearance of being human, and whose intentions are to take over the planet. This sets in motion Vincent's lonely (at least in the first season) quest to root out and thwart the invaders' plans for world domination.

Thinnes hit the right note as a regular guy finding himself in extraordinary circumstances, and show producer Quinn Martin, having also produced The Fugitive, knew how to frame a series based around a lone wanderer who is destined to hunt and be hunted. The loneliness and isolation experienced by Vincent is very similar to that felt by the Fugitive's Richard Kimble.

This was a wonderful show, and now it will be seen and loved by a much wider audience.",1204156800,10,1272,4.799086757990867
3100936,5,B0012Z36EO,"This is good news for science fiction fans as well as boomers who remember the show from its original airings. I got bootlegs of the show a while back and thoroughly enjoyed them. If you want to see what inspired X-Files, this is the show. There were some great guest stars in the 2 seasons this ran, like Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell, Dabney Coleman and many familiar faces from the David Janssen ""Fugitive"" series. Quinn Martin Productions had a sort of ""favorites"" list for casting guest stars and supporting players, and it is fun spotting them in various shows produced by QM. Anyhow, my recommendation is to watch these shows a few at a time, not in a marathon. Remember, this is not like LOST, where back to back viewing reveals small details. Invaders was a weekly show, and while it has a continuity to it, it can get repetitive if you watch more than a couple in a sitting.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive-Season-One-Vol-1/dp/B000Q6GUSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive - Season One, Vol. 1</a>",1203638400,2,1067,5.319526627218935

3100941,4,B0012Z36EO,"As of today 22 April 2008, and further to my review below, Paramount have done what I requested. According to images of the back cover of the new DVD (not released till May), Roy Thinnes will be providing episode introductions as well as being interviewed.  There is also a 60 minute version of Beachhead apparently after a call to fans. Finally there is a commentary by series creator on one episode, 'The Innocents'.  Well done. Looks like I will have to buy the Region 1 edition to replace my Region 4 copy. Now, Paramount, could you please keep up the good work with the second and final season!

Original review : I am hopeful that the US DVD version of the Invaders will be done right by Paramount.  Although I was glad to see season one released here in Australia some months ago, there was no 75 minute version of Beachhead (as originally broadcast) or any extras. Roy Thinnes is still an articulate advocate and commentator on the series, and in cases like this, there might only be one chance 'to get it right'. In my view, DVD extras are likely to have historical signifance for future generations, and similarly, there is a need to preserve the most complete and best quality episodes available. Having said all that, the picture quality of the Season One episodes released here in Oz were pretty good. However, I do not know if they are uncut. This series is a well loved and remembered show for baby boomers such as myself, and season two is eagerly anticipated! Could someone at Paramount ask Roy to do some interviews and commentaries please.",1201910400,10,1558,4.634057971014493

3335250,5,B0012Z36EO,"When I was a kid, this show truly terrified me and DID give me nightmares - but I loved it anyway! Now, at long last, the original, iconic Sci-Fi TV Classic ""The Invaders"" is being released on DVD in boxed season sets. The first 17 episodes have been gathered in the initial DVD release.

The Invaders, which premiered on ABC in 1967, starred Roy Thinnes. It was a mid-season replacement show that was an hour-long, full-color science fiction thriller that sadly lasted only 43 episodes. Families across the country truly gathered around their TV sets when the series aired on Tuesday's at 8:30 p.m. to see what happened next.

The show opened with an unforgettable and chilling narration: ""The Invaders, a Quinn Martin Production starring Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent. The Invaders - alien beings from a dying planet. Their destination - the Earth. Their purpose: to make it `their' world. David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut that he never found. It began with a closed, deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy. Now, David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here; that they have taken human form. Somehow, he must convince a disbelieving world, that the nightmare has already begun...""

Voice talents were Hank Simms, who was the introductory narrator, and William Woodson who was episode narrator for the entire series.

In the first episode, Vincent is driving home at night after working a long, tiring day. He turns onto what he believes is a shortcut, then down the dark, isolated road. Unexpectedly, he ends up at Bud's Cafe, situated in a ghost town. Exhausted, he decides to park to rest for a while before continuing home. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, something wakes him: a strange glowing object is ""landing"" in front of his eyes.

Leaving his car and edging forward, he sees the advance army of what he learns is an alien invasion. From that moment forward, he tries to warn a skeptical world that there are aliens in their midst masquerading as humans. At the same time, he struggles to stay alive - because not only had he seen the aliens, but they had seen him!

While the premise seems simple in this day and age, the series had such great production values, flawless acting by Thinnes, fantastically creepy music by Dominic Frontiere, use of creative and intentionally distorted camera work, and even weird title credits by Wayne Fitzgerald, that it really did scare the wits out of legions of fans. In addition, the true form of the Invaders was never shown, so viewers' imaginations were encouraged to run wild, an effective creative device that has been sadly abandoned in this ""show everything no matter what"" Internet age.

As the series progressed, Vincent was able to identify some Invaders through certain characteristics, and he also learned that their human forms were unstable and had to be ""regenerated"" occasionally, or they would perish.

In 1995, there was a feeble attempt to resurrect the show in a mini-series starring Scott Bakula as Nolan Wood, with an appearance by Thinnes.

""The Invaders"" remains so popular that in 2004 the character of David Vincent was ranked No. 6 in TV Guide's list of the Twenty-Five Greatest Sci-Fi Legends.

It may not be coincidental that The Invaders seems an intriguing mix of the Sci-Fi film masterpiece ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and the TV Classic drama ""The Fugitive,"" which was also produced by the brilliant Quinn Martin, who also produced The Untouchables, and The Streets of San Francisco, to name a few.

Episodes included in this boxed set are: Beachhead; The Experiment; The Mutation; The Leeches; Genesis; Vikor; Nightmare; Doomsday Minus One; Quantity: Unknown; The Innocent; The Ivy Curtain; The Betrayed; Storm; Panic; Moonshot; Wall of Crystal; The Condemned.

Let's hope the remainder of this fantastic series will be quickly released on DVD.",1201392000,194,4020,4.921713441654357

Each episode is written, more or less, to stand on its own.

That didn't last long, as we all sadly know how that channel turned out. Watching this in proper order for the first time after it came out was a real treat. I was very impressed at the production quality and special effects in this show, truly state of the art by 1960s standards. I was truly scared for David Vincent at times, wondering how the advanced alien technology would be used against him. I had the same feeling when the ""V"" mini-series was on TV back in the early 1980s. I thought the alien technology was truly frightening in ways. I felt like a bug in a jar, not knowing really who or what was watching or when, and that I had nowhere to hide and no defense if they ever wanted to come get me. I liked how the show and David progressed as the season went on, evolving as he learned more and more. I don't think the aliens were as dumb and incapable as they were sometimes shown, though. I think they probably could have liquidated anyone they wanted at anytime. They did continually thwart Vincent's plans, though, no how carefully prepared. Like ""Khan"" from Star Trek, they managed to kill everyone else but like a poor marksman they kept missing the target.

  To sum up, if you're expecting the kind of cheesy Lost In Space or Thunderbirds kind of TV series and special effects and plots, you're going to be pleasantly surprised here. Think more on the lines of ""Star Trek"" special effects from the same time period and you'll be right. Combine that quality with the drama and suspense of shows like..well..Star Trek, but with intense intrigue and mystery like I Spy or Mission Impossible or one of those type of shows, or THE FUGITIVE! Yeah, there's some of that in here.

  There were also a couple of movies that came out in the 1990's, ""The Arrival"", and it's sequel ""The Arrival 2"" that were virtually a copy of this show's premise. They could have just as accurately been called ""The Invaders: The movie"" 1 and two. They were good movies too.",1436572800,2,2200,4.433168316831683

3335296,1,B0012Z36EO,"The Invaders - Season 1 [0574 - 11-11-2014 - TV show - SF] Summary:
  First off this is a 1960's Science-Fiction TV series concerned solely with the apparent clandestine invasion by alien beings from outer space - which look - talk - dress and behave like middle class folks you would encounter in any town in the 60's. Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) is apparently the only person in the United States who truly believes the space aliens have invaded and travels from coast to coast and points between to frustrate the invaders depraved goal of world domination. In each episode David encounters and puts a stop to their shenanigans - with the help of local folks who, after encountering the aliens and witnessing them turn a glowing red and disappear when killed still doubt their existence.

Content & Packaging:
5 disks - 17 episodes - first shown on ABC from 1/10/67 to 5/9/67. Season 1 is packaged in the standard, snap case - episode summaries are printed on the reverse of the cover insert - not very handy since you have to jimmy the disks to read the text. - The most interesting ""extra"" is the Roy Thinnes introduction to each episode.

Positive Comments:
 The show features many 1960's TV stars in supporting roles.
 Some of the locations are visually interesting but there is not mention in the credits where they a located.
 The video quality is very good - colors are true and vivid.

The Cast:
Even with the familiar faces in supporting roles none stand out in these dramas. Roy Thinnes is very good in a most difficult role - he has to convince us viewers that the aliens are real but ""somehow"" can not convince anyone else - think about that for a moment.

Negative Comments:
 The major failure of this show is that the creative talent - writers - producers - directors never bothered to even attempt to convince the viewer that David Vincent's efforts are credible and even marginally believable. I see it as contempt by them for the intelligence of their target viewer.
 Here we have an unemployed architect traveling all over the country - one week in Florida - next New England - then the mid-west (all suspiciously looking like southern California) - clutching a newspaper article about a strange event - finding the exact persons causing the mischief (aliens of course) defeating their nefarious scheme and musing that no one still believes him.
 How does he obtain the funds to travel all over the country? - He has no employment or benefactor and is not, by appearance or life style, wealthy. Also how does he obtain the newspaper items with the oddball occurrences from all over the United States?
 The aliens are fully aware that David Vincent is their sworn enemy - in fact Vincent has had many conversations with the space people and even was taken for a ride one of their saucers.
 Since he is such a thorn in the alien's side and they are aware that no one believes him why not just eliminate him - Vincent's efforts have resulted in the death of numerous aliens just in season 1 - so payback would be only fair.
 We have been informed in several episodes that the aliens have no pulse. All Vincent has to do is capture one of the aliens and bring him to a hospital or doctor to get the attention that he so desperately desires - of course that never happens.
 Let us assume that Vincent can travel everywhere since he is independently wealthy and can afford a super efficient service that reviews every newspaper in the country looking for those quirky news items that hint at the alien's schemes. If so then why doesn't Vincent hire some muscle to help him. In many episodes he get pummeled by several aliens and can hardly fend them off.
 If you watch all the episodes you will see the same light blue Ford pickup truck in several shows - I mean to say what the heck those stupid viewers won't notice.

Recommendations:
Watching these shows I learned a lesson about wishful nostalgia. You see in the winter of 1967 I viewed some of the """"Invader"" shows as a nave teenager. Fast forward almost 50 years and I was startled to see the shows were released on DVD - well so much for what I thought was entertainment as a teen. I did watch all 17 episodes hoping for redemption but, alas, there was none to be had.
I could only recommend this show to dedicated fans of early TV series and/or SF shows.

12-22-2014
I did watch all season 2 of ""The Invaders' and was still disappointed. Yes David did convert a few followers but I still could not ""suspend my disbelief"" to recommend these shows. I will now openly admit that I now keep a sharp lookout for folks with bent pinky fingers who wear dark suit and drive around in Ford sedans.",1416009600,2,4670,4.5579450418160095

Interestingly, the aliens do not always agree, and some of them actually don't support the invasion. But enough do, and are threaded through the world, that Vincent has trouble convincing people of their existence. He manages, here and there, and he makes enough noise about it that the aliens don't dare murder him, for fear folks will start taking him seriously. But that doesn't mean they're giving up.

3335304,4,B0012Z36EO,"After the success of The Fugitive, producer Quinn Martin's next effort built on the themes that worked so well in The Fugitive: a lone hero on a mission, finding that danger lurks in every town he visits, and never knowing who he can trust. However, instead of an accused killer trying to clear himself and avoid capture, this time the stakes are much higher. Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) has to convince the world they've been invaded by aliens whose goal is to conquer them from within.

The invaders appear human (although some of them have a deformed finger that allows Vincent to spot them more easily). They also have an advanced technology that helps them accomplish their goals (including a device with which they can kill people so that it appears the person dies of a cerebral hemorrhage). Most disconcerting for Vincent, when they die, which occurs frequently, they turn a glowing red and completely vanish, along with all their clothes and everything in their immediate possession. That makes Vincent's task of proving their existence considerably more difficult.

The show only lasted a season and a half, and this set includes the 17 episodes of the original half season (the show premiered in the winter). There are actually two versions of the pilot episode (in which Vincent learns of the alien's existence and that they have taken over a small California town), the version that aired and an extended version some ten minutes longer which works better. The show started to run out of gas midway in the second season, but this initial set has most of the best episodes and is of considerably better overall quality.

The plots generally involve just that, alien plots. Typically, Vincent hears of strange goings on in some location and goes to investigate, only to discover the aliens have set up some sort of facility he has to stop. For the most part, the aliens themselves are not mastermind geniuses or raving fanatics but average everyday sorts, and figuring out just who in a town is or is not an alien often keeps Vincent and viewers occupied for much of an episode. The quality of the guest cast is good, with a lot of familiar TV faces who would soon have shows of their own, such as Jack Lord, Peter Graves, Arthur Hill, William Windom, and Ed Asner. Thinnes himself wasn't the acting equal of David Janssen in The Fugitive, but he was good at portraying harried desperation that his character often felt.

The two best episodes are somewhat offbeat. In Vikki, Suzanne Pleshette plays the title character, an alien who hasn't fully bought into their plans and tries to help Vincent, while the two develop feelings for each other. In The Innocents, Michael Rennie plays an alien leader, who tries to convince Vincent that their goals for earth are really beneficial rather than harmful. This involves a bit of mind control on their part, and eventually, Vincent figures out what they really want.

Episodes like these two showed the series' potential, but most of the very rest fell into a familiar formula and weren't all that much different from the PI shows of the era. The only difference was that instead of trying to uncover a smuggling operation or drug ring, Vincent is trying to find a facility that enables the aliens to regenerate themselves or some other bizarre enterprise. The action may have felt familiar to audiences, but the episodes were quite well done.

The Invaders has become somewhat forgotten today, and a 90s attempted update as well as periodic feelers for a feature film have failed, but it proved to be the inspiration for many science fiction and action films and series over the years. Taken for what they are, these episodes are still well made, well acted, well written for the most part, and entertaining today.",1387670400,5,3780,4.834621329211746

  Special Features - see below
------------------------------------------------
I remember watching the show as a young teen in 1967.  We didn't have a color tv
so this was my first time to see it in color.

For me, the show was not as good as I remembered.  The David Vincent character is
so wooden that he could easily pass for one of the aliens.  Every episode has the
same tone or feel.  Compare that to a contemporary series like Star Trek where it
would vary from week to week.  It might be a drama, romance, comedy, action, tragedy, mystery, etc.

The creator, Larry Cohen, says his intent was to combine science fiction with the
""running man"" concept as in The Fugitive.  There was a new location each week and there were ""name"" guest stars but that is the extent of the similarity in my opinion.  The Invaders are not actively pursuing David Vincent and the police think he is just a kook.  He travels around the country openly (no alias).  I remember one episode where DV slugged a policeman and in the end he wasn't even charged!
Many episodes have the exact same story line:  DV reads about some strange occurrence.  He traves to the scene to investigate and uncovers an alien scheme.  He thwarts their plans but they manage to destroy all evidence.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Features

Episode intros by Roy Thinnes -  Most are only a couple sentences.  He gives the title and the date it originally aired.  RT seems bored.  He does add a little more on later episodes but the intros are not really worth watching.  How about some
interesting/funny anecdotes about your guest stars?

Expanded version of the pilot episode - a few extra scenes

Interview of Roy Thinnes - not a real interview.  RT talks about some preselected
topics.  It was an interesting feature.

Commentary by series creator Larry Cohen - One episode is shown with the audio muted and a voice-over by LC.  He didn't really comment on the episode itself.  It was just a rambling dialog, much of it about other tv shows and movies that he had
worked on.  He was very honest in telling about his concept for the show.  He wanted to do a Fugitive type show with a sci-fi theme which would evolve into a Mission Impossible show as a team was assembled to fight the Invaders.  He basically sold the concept and a bunch of story ideas and that was it.  The producer, Quinn Martin, had his own team of directors, writers, etc. so Larry Cohen was essentially shut out.  He didn't like the repetition of episodes as the show went on.  He thought there were too many Invaders and they were too easy to kill.

He was writing for tv at the tail end of the McCarthy/blacklisting era and was upset by what was going on.  He wanted to take the concept of the infiltration of society and make a ""mockery"" of it by putting it in terms of aliens from another planet.  That didn't make sense to me.  If he thought the anticommunist hearings were a witch hunt then shouldn't David Vincent have really been a kook, with the Invaders just in his imagination?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of aliens masquerading as humans is a classic sci-fi concept, most notably portrayed in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  It certainly deserved to be explored in a longer format but for me it just became repetitious as a weekly series.  It is too bad they didn't have miniseries back then as that would have been a good way to explore the idea in more depth.  I think the show would have been better if DV had a sidekick or love interest.  Suzanne Pleshette appeared in one episode as an alien who didn't fit in (with the Invaders) because she had developed feelings.  She would have been perfect as a companion for DV.  The show could have been played straight or as a spoof ala The Avengers.  It just needed some romance or humor or something to mix it up a bit.

The only thing that made it worth watching for me was seeing all the familiar guest stars.  It was like reuniting with an old friend.  Some from the first season:  Diane Baker, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, Arthur Hill, Jack Lord, Diana Hyland, Wm Windom, James Whitmore, Susan Strasberg, Michael Rennie, Susan Oliver, Ed Begley, Joseph Campanella, Barbara Luna, Peter Graves, Burgess Meredith, and Ralph Bellamy.

A reasonable price for this set would be about $15.00.  I probably will not buy the second season unless the price drops to that level.",1340064000,4,4534,4.7535301668806165
3335314,3,B0012Z36EO,"It isn't quite as I remember it, but it was entertaining.  It's hard to believe that good ol' David Vincent never got his hands on one of those alien weapons or grab some evidence just once. The aliens were just as lame: kidnapping and extortion? Just vaporize the guy after a certain point.",1317168000,,291,4.490566037735849
3335315,5,B0012Z36EO,"Quinn Martin, who made a name for himself in the TV crime drama genre, was admittedly not much of a sci-fi fan when he was pitched the idea for The Invaders, but went ahead with it and wound up creating one of the most memorable and scary shows of the late 1960's.

The series' pilot, ""Beachhead"", begins with the intro that would appear before the remaining episodes of the series: architect David Vincent is driving home from a business trip. Obviously groggy, he stops at a diner, hoping for a cup of coffee and a little respite from the road when, all of a sudden, he sees a flying saucer land at the diner. For the rest of the episode, Vincent tries to convince the townspeople what he saw; some folks are skeptical, while others believe him...most of those other folks being the aliens, who do pretty much everything to Vincent to get him out of town, even trying to frame him for the murder of his partner, Alan Landers (James Daly).

For the rest of this season, we see more of the same: Vincent traveling to a small town somewhere to meet with someone who could help him or to investigate some bizarre phenomena, ultimately running into aliens who want to kill him (their shiny disc to the back of the neck causing either heart attack or stroke) and skeptical law enforcement/government people. It's a sci-fi man on the run series, similar to Martin's classic The Fugitive, even created by Larry Cohen, who wrote some of the better Fugitive episodes.

So what sort of mayhem do the aliens cause in this first season? They're responsible for a plague of locusts attacking a Kansas farm town (""Nightmare""), they try to sabotage the U.S. space program (""Moonshot""), they cause serious tidal waves off the coast of Florida (""Storm"") and infiltrate a major communications plant (""The Condemned""), among other things. Through it all, Vincent remains a dogged, determined hero, out to stop the aliens from taking over the human race!

In addition to the 17 episodes featured here, there are a few bonus items. Thinnes himself appears before each episode, giving slight commentary about the episode and guest actors (even shamelessly plugging other shows on DVD from CBS like Mission: Impossible), and also gives a more in-depth interview as well. There are also a trio of network promos for the series, but the highlight would have to be the rare extended version of the pilot, with 15 minutes of extra footage.

The picture quality is excellent - far better than was possible to see on the TV sets of the day.  The only disappointment was the introduction by the star Roy Thinnes.  His comments might as well had been mailed in.  He seemed bored.  I had hoped for some inside comments on what went on during the making of the episodes, but there was little of that.

3335330,5,B0012Z36EO,"Though I enjoyed both seasons of THE INVADERS, Season One is my favorite.  As with most first season shows, Season One of THE INVADERS is when the production team did some experimenting before it settled on a ""formula.""  As such the beginning of the season is fresher and a little more raw than the series' second year run.

In the first season David Vincent bears the burden of his crusade against the alien invasion alone. Although each show adds additional witnesses to alien activity, Vincent is seemingly the only one dedicated enough to give up his personal life, employment, and reputation in the pursuit of the aliens.  This is very different from Season Two where Vincent is a member of a larger organization of believers.

The plot:  Aliens from another galaxy have landed on Earth slowly establishing their network.  Their goal is to acquire the Earth as a replacment planet for their dying world.  The aliens have taken human form both to survive in the oxygen rich environment and to infiltrate society.  In the pilot episode ""Beachhead"" Architect David Vincent accidentally witnesses one of the alien landings and finds that no one believes him.  Worse is that police treat him as a kook and the aliens are out to do away with him all together.  Ultimately Vincent takes up his lonely pursuit of the aliens.  Vincent is played by handsome blue-eyed Roy Thinnes.  Thinnes had alreay appeared in several prior Quinn Martin television productions and ended up landing the starring role in THE INVADERS.

The pilot episode was a bit of a disappointment in that Vincent's initial encounter with the alien saucer is little more than what we are shown during the beginning credits, theme music, and narration.  In fact the beginning narration and credits of each episode show us the saucers traveling past the moon toward Earth, something that is never seen in the pilot.  Still it was a fitting beginning to the series.

In terms of infiltration the Invaders are certainly successful in that aliens are already well established -- in most cases the story lines give them at least a year of tenure -- in law enforcment, industry, the military and government agencies. In terms of their appearance we are only treated to the Invaders in human form.  We never see them in their original alien state.

There is no rhyme or reason for why the Invaders take one particular human form or another.  You would think they would be best served appearing as strapping young healthy men and women.  Instead the Invaders show up as young and elderly, heavy and petite, or any other common human forms.  Though the Invaders sometimes borrow the identity of a deceased individual it is more the case of identity theft than one-for-one replacment ala INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  In most cases the Invaders are experts at forging certificates, identification and other documents allowing them unimpeded access across the country.

One of the alien prime directives appears to be to prevent the general public from finding out about them.  As such the Invaders generally restrict themselves to standard firearms and make use of Earth-bound technology such as radios and rotary phones -- though I am sure there were production budgetary reasons as well.  When cornered the aliens will not hesitate to take their own lives to prevent their capture.  Episode three is the first episode where we witness the aliens incinerate when they are dying or badly wounded.  Thus when the aliens die they leave no trace behind.  Even the items they are carrying incinerate with them.

Each of the episodes are stand alone stories with conflict and resolution within each episode.  Though the aliens schemes are normally foiled by Vincent, sometimes it is difficult to determine the victor.  Season One has some great and very familiar guest stars, several who would appear again in Season Two as totally different characters.  Included in Season One are J.D. Cannon, Ellen Corby, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, William Windom, Jack Lord, Michael Rennie, James Whitmore, Burgess Meredith, Ralph Bellamy, Joseph Campenella, and others.

The DVD does feature a few special features such as audio commentary and optional introductions to each episode by a contemporary Roy Thinnes.  In the Thinnes introductions there was a missed opportunity in that the introductions are limited to a short synopsis of the episode highlighting the appearance of a guest star.  It would have been better to allow Thinnes to elaborate on behind the scenes aspects of each episode.  Season One is also limited to 17 episodes.  Remember that the first season of THE INVADERS was as a midseason replacement.  The second year was a full 26-season season.",1242432000,3,4713,5.001283697047497

And the only person standing in the way of their evil schemes. Is?.You guessed it,David Vincent. This five disc 17 episode DVD set takes us on a journey with David Vincent as we share his nightmare. In his fight against the invaders week after week. The episodes on this DVD set includes attacks by the invaders. On our space program,our nuclear program,the ecology system and even our weather. The Invaders was created by Larry Cohen and was a Quinn Martin production. And over the years has become a Sci-Fi icon and a classic TV show. This show use to give me nightmares. Along with its eerie music and a long list of noticeable guest stars like Roddy McDowall,Peter Graves,Suzanne Pleshette,Jack Lord and Joseph Campanella.

Have alien creatures really come from their dying planet to inhabit the Earth and take over its unsuspecting citizens or are these the lunatic hallucinations of a man on the verge of insanity?

While traveling a desolate stretch of road one night David Vincent on the verge of falling asleep pulls off into a very remote area of the woods for a quick nap and witnesses something he can't believe is really happening. To David's surprise an alien spacecraft has in fact landed on Earth and at this point he is the only one who knows of their existence. He quickly realizes he must do something to tell the rest of the people, that the aliens have arrived. The only problem for David Vincent is that the aliens are aware he has seen them; he just doesn't know that they know. Welcome to ""The Invaders"" Season one.

From the creative genius of Larry Cohen, producer Quinn Martin and special thanks to Paramount Studios we have the first 16 episodes of this classic Sci-Fi television show to enjoy when ever we want. The overall quality of the first 16 episodes is pretty good as it appears the prints are from the 35mm prints and not the original source material. I'm no expert on this, it just seems like that's the case here. The episodes do suffer from dirt, debris and some graininess here and there, but not enough to detract from my viewing experience. This 5 disc single sided DVD set is well done and Paramount Studios should be commended for their efforts. My only complaint is that they split the set up into two volumes instead of a complete series release. Even with the quality issues I've raised, these episodes in my opinion have never looked better!

3335336,5,B0012Z36EO,"What a pleasure it is to have this series available on DVD at last! For those old enough to remember, David Vincent's lonely, never-ending battle to save humanity from secret alien invasion provided plenty of thrills & chills, especially if you were an impressionable child. And it's equally a pleasure to discover that it holds up very nicely, just as paranoid & frustrating as it ever was ... for David Vincent was truly a prophet without honor in his own land, generally mocked & dismissed by the very people he struggled to save. That haunted, unheralded aspect of the series always added an extra punch for me.

Yes, the special effects aren't so special by contemporary standards, and the overall storyline not as ""realistic."" But the special effects, though crude now, are still effective; and in any case, they're merely frosting on the cake. The same might be said about the ""unrealistic"" portions of the series -- just how did David Vincent support himself, and so on. TV shows of that era tended to have a heavier, more obviously symbolic content, and trusted in the imagination of the viewers to fill in some blanks. And those ""unrealistic"" gaps gave it an additional nightmarish quality that can still take a very cold grasp of your primal fears. While everything becomes dated in one sense, I've got a feeling that a great deal of contemporary TV, supposedly far more ""realistic,"" won't age as well as this series has ...

So open yourself up to a different style of storytelling, enter this waking nightmare, and keep an eye out for that deformed little finger -- the aliens are already here! And after all, isn't that what so many of us still fear today -- the Other who looks just like us, but isn't? It's a fear that's always current & relevant, and thus can never become dated, alas.

And the second season should be here shortly ...

That was way before the days of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery). In 1967, a computer with same computing capacity of today's cell phone had a price tag of several million dollars!

But it is!

It's pretty basic science fiction, with inexpensive sets and what might be considered laughable effects. Sort of The Fugitive, with aliens. (Same producer did both.) But there's lots of familiar faces, fine acting, and some real issues that still prompt discussion today. There's real chills and suspense, and you'll never look at people's pinkies the same way again.

Another thing I didn't expect was the way my husband and I marveled at the way people lived in 1966. He makes calls from a pay phone! The cars are huge! The suits are baggy! They listen to records!

If you were a fan back when, ya gotta have. If you weren't, it's still a charming example of a thoughtful science fiction series at a time when this was very rare. Perhaps it paved the way for Star Trek.",1218672000,7,937,4.398843930635838

Transfer for DVD coul be better, but both sound and image are highly satisfactory. For the price they ask for it, it's a fair purchase.

There's only one unforgivable flaw, in my opinion: the lack of English subtitles for the hearing-impaired. I know there's a budget and a profit assingned to each product, but I think it's almost an offense to not inlude (at least) English subtitles.

3335357,4,B0012Z36EO,"About the Show:

Unlike the other two major television networks of the era, in the late 60's ABC had what it called a ""second season"" which premiered new shows in January.  One of the network's biggest hits was the campy ""Batman"" which premiered a year earlier in 1966.  ""The Invaders"" premiered as a part of the 1967 second season and immediately caught the attention of the television viewing public.

Produced by the legendary Quinn Martin (""The Untouchables,"" ""The FBI,"" ""The Fugitive"" and later ""Cannon"" and ""Barnaby Jones""), ""The Invaders starred Roy Thinnes as David Vincent, an architect that accidentally witnesses the landing of an alien spacecraft.  This sighting launches Vincent on a campaign to stop the alien invaders, either singlehandedly or with the aid of others that he convinces of the threat to humanity.

Each week Vincent goes to a different part of the country to do battle with the space invaders and somehow, within the confines of the show's hour-long format, he manages to thwart their plans.

Naturally, the aliens try to do Mr. Vincent in but somehow he manages to escape certain death.

Thinnes brings believability in his role of a man determined to protect humanity from the other worldly menace, a man that will do all within his power to bring down the alien menace.

Boy, he must have some really deep pockets in order to travel all over, never appearing to actually work at his architectural firm.  Only In the pilot episode (""Beachhead""), along with ""The Innocent""), is there even the hint of his design skills.

The show does not rely heavily on special effects, dealing more with character interaction and some really intriguing situations for the hero and his encounters.

One of the series' strengths is the quality of the writing and the line-up of guest stars, many familiar and some on amazing up-and-comers.

The guest list reads like a ""who's who"" of character actors of the 60's, 70's, and 80's: the ubiquitous Alfred Ryder, Louise Latham, John Larch, Jeanette Nolan, Andrew Duggan, Irene Tedrow, Phillip Pine, Robert Emhardt, Milton Selzer, William Talman, Susan Oliver of ""Star Trek"" Orion slave girl fame, the eternally youthful Barbara Luna, Robert Walker (""Star Trek's"" Charlie X), Murray Matheson, Murray Hamilton, Harold Gould, Lloyd Gould, Joanne Linville, R.G. Armstrong, William Smithers, Paul Carr, Frank Marth, Harry Lauter, Ford Rainey, Richard X. Slattery, Barney Phillips, John McLiam, Kent Smith, the dependable Strother Martin (""Cool Hand Luke""), Edward Andrews, Ross Elliott, and Wesley Addy. Each greatly delivers to the stories that intertwine Vincent's quest to uncover the alien threat and his interactions with unsuspecting citizens along with the malevolent aliens.

Guest stars that had yet made their jump to stardom or greater familiarity in shows of their own or movies include Jack Lord (one year shy of his ""Hawaii 5-0"" triumph), Peggy Lipton (""The Mod Squad"" and future wife of Quincy Jones), Suzanne Pleshette (""The Bob Newhart Show""), Simon Scott (""Trapper John, M.D.""), Peter Graves (""Mission: Impossible""), future Emmy winners Ed Asner (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), William Windom  (""My World and Welcome to It""), James Whitmore (""The Practice""), Jack Warden (""Brian's Song""), Burgess Meredith (""Tail Gunner Joe""), and Ellen Corby (""The Waltons""),as well as Arthur Hill (""Owen Marshall""), a very young Dabney Coleman (""9 to 5""), Dabbs Greer (Reverend Walden on ""Little House on the Prairie""), and Norman Fell (""Three's Company"")

Actors accustomed to appearing on both the big and small screen that get involved with David Vincent are Roddy McDowall (""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Fright Night,"" ""National Velvet""), Diane Baker (""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Marnie""),Oscar winner Ed Begley (""Sweet Bird of Youth""), Susan Strasberg  (""Picnic,"" ""Rollercoaster""),  Michael Rennie (""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""The Lost World,"" ""Hotel,"" ""Island in the Sun""), Ralph Bellamy (""Sunrise at Campobello,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Trading Places""),

Incidentally, Ryder, Addy, Rennie, Luna, Matheson, and Nancy Wickmore deliciously chew the scenery as alien leaders, respectively in the episodes ""Vikor,"" ""Doomsday Minus One,"" ""The Innocent,"" ""Storm,"" ""The Ivy Curtain,"" and ""The Betrayed,""

""Storm"" also boasts an intriguing religious slant pitting a priest torn between his faith and the fate of the world with a great performance from Joseph Campanella, later to star on ""Mannix"" with Mike Connors.

Another of the show's strengths is the music provided by composer Dominic Frontiere.  Frontiere had already endeared himself to sci-fi fans for his fantastic music for the first season of the classic ""The Outer Limits.""

Besides the obvious (fashion, cars, haircuts, etc.), one of the show's aspects that dates it is the use of the term ""girl"" for the featured women in the respective episodes.

This show was definitely pre-woman's lib.

Also, most Quinn Martin shows featured a disclaimer at the end announcing that cars were provided by the Ford Motor Company and ""The Invaders"" is no different.

What an understatement!  A caf scene has no less than five Fords of various vintage parked in front.  Another had cars going up the street...all of `em Fords.

About the compilation's features:

Each episode can be played with or without an explanatory intro by Thinnes.  There is also a commentary by creator Larry Cohen that can be optionally heard during the viewing of ""The Innocent.""
The extended version of the pilot offers a few more details that don't necessarily add to the storyline; thus, it's no wonder that they were deleted from the version aired in '67.

The interview of Thinnes demands much patience because the actor tends to babble a little but he does provide some interesting insight into the production of the two-season series.

Because of that interview and Cohen's rather mundane commentary track, the five-star series loses a star for the DVD compilation.",1215993600,4,5947,5.265889830508475

3335374,4,B0012Z36EO,"I was 9 when The Invaders came out.  I didn't get to see the first episode, nor see it every week, but at that age, I loved all things Sci-Fi.  We still had Star Trek at the time.  The Invaders was so creepy to me that aliens were here and seemed to run most everything and I loved it.  David Vincent worked alone to stop them, a superhero with no super powers.  Since I was so young, I got outvoted on a lot of shows and didn't get to see many that ""I"" wanted.  But I remembered the few episodes of The Invaders I saw . . . and that awesome show intro-- each week with the landing spacecraft and David Vincent's glowing face, looking in wonder. Since The Invaders didn't go into syndication there were no reruns.  I have remembered 40 long years.

Fast forward to 2008.  Now I am 50, and still never got to see that 1st Episode.  When I saw the DVDs were coming out I could hardly wait.  When the DVDs came out I bought the set and finally watched that 1st episode.  Roy Thinnes is very believable as David Vincent.

Watching the shows, I was impressed at how well the show progressed, advancing the plots that could have become VERY formula driven.  The first few were like this, but after about the 4th episode things started to change and I believe this show holds up very well.  There are Guest Stars galore -- and excellent ones.  Famous 60's and 70's and current biggies, too.  That makes the show better with great actors, that sometimes overshadow the not-so great storylines that happened sometimes.

A nice interview with Roy Thinnes is included - He seems like a nice man and I wish he could have been seen more on screen all these years.

WARNING:  DON'T WATCH THE ROY THINNES INTROS WITHOUT SEEING THE EPISODES FIRST -- HE GIVES OUT MANY SPOILERS!!!!  Watch them after you see an episode or disc.

In summation, the set is really good -- not loaded with extras but some good ones.  The look of the video is exceptional, especially for a 40+ year old show. The acting is great and Roy Thinnes makes the main character very sympathetic and enjoyable.

This was a great show and I await season two. for the 60's the effects, the saucer and aliens burning up were great. Why didn't David Vincent just carry a camera, oh well, I am glad he didnt.

Back then the Aliens needn't to show their original form (although in one of the episodes we got a small hint) to intrigue my senses, I believe that leaving that to own's imagination adds even more suspense to this unique watching experience. I particularly enjoyed the second episode (The Experiment, guest star none other than Roddy McDowell!), definetely a Classic. I have to mention that for being a 1960's TV series, it had some decent effects for the era and the nail-biting suspense combined by the excellent actors of the day, this is surely a gem to watch.

Well I broke down and purchased ""The Invaders"" and this review is coming from someone who had never seen one episode of this show.

1. After watching ""Beach Head"", I was slightly disappointed in the writing and directing. The way David Vincent gets out of jams seems unrealistic at times.
2. I am at this time watching the last episode on disc 1 call ""The Leeches"" ! The color seems to go from excellent to kinda fuzzy.

3. This show is slowly growing on me and I may change my rating later.

4. This show would have been more effective in Black & White, as it would have given it a Sci-fi/Film Noir feel to it !!

3335396,5,B0012Z36EO,"Ah, the 60's in America--the cold war, space race, Vietnam, alien abductions, flying saucer sightings, and The Invaders.  What could be scarier than alien invaders with sinister intent, using a small disk with blinking lights that causes death to the unwitting (or unwilling) when held on the back of their neck.  Of course, it had to be held there by a human looking alien, except for the one finger sticking out on their hands (no, not that finger!) so we could tell them apart from the good guys.

And so it began one mysterious, foggy night when David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) looks for a shortcut and finds a flying saucer instead.

I have to admit, I loved this series.  During high school I avidly read all the UFO related books out there, went to a lecture or two, watched every schlocky '50's alien movie I can't tell you how many times, and couldn't wait to see how Vincent would both defeat and be defeated by the bad aliens each and every week.

The series was produced by Quinn Martin, famous for such series as The Fugitive, The FBI, 12 O'Clock High, Cannon, Barnaby Jones, etc.  But think of The Invaders as the Fugitive in reverse! Instead of searching for a one-armed man, Vincent knows there's plenty of aliens around--just look at their straight fingers and sinister expressions--but they thwart his attempts to expose them every week!  He's chasing them, instead of being chased.  Go figure!

But, hey--it was good TV then and it's GREAT TV now!  The set includes all of the episodes from the first season, 17 in all.  The bonus disk includes a lengthy interview with Roy Thinnes, an extended version of the pilot episode, ""Beachhead;"" and 3 of the first season promo pieces.

Some great guest stars in these shows, many prior to becoming real stars, and a few quirky almost typecast character actors, as well.  For example, I recognized the actor who played Spock's rival in ""Amok Time"" playing an alien henchman in the first two episodes of the Invaders!

You can choose to play an introduction from Roy Thinnes before each episode, if you wish.  Some of them offer behind the scenes trivia about the episode and series, special effects and obstacles they had to overcome in production.

It's well worth owning, even if you're not paranoid.  And the music is by Dominic Frontiere--one of the most gifted composers of TV and movie music in history--the Invaders them is still contemporary today, holding its own against the techno, syntho, whatever electronic crapola pop theme you want to throw against it.

OK, why are you looking at me like that?  And what's that disk you have in your hand?  Um...about that finger you can't straighten--you're making me nervous.  Very nervous!

Guess I'll wait for the next DVD set or two to see how the series really turns out.  Seriously, I'm not climbing this ladder into any disk shaped object with you, no matter what.  So just go back inside and report back to Area 51, where you belong!

3335409,5,B0012Z36EO,"I must say that I have been a big sci-fi fan since the 1980's and was born in 1970, so I didn't have an opportunity to actually watch the show when it was shown on television.

With the technologies of today and because of the popular demand the show was produced on DVD.  I purchased this for two reasons 1: The great reviews posted here on Amazon and 2:  My interest for great Sci-Fi.

I must say after watching the entire Season 1 on DVD I was not disappointed!

Here are the reasons to own this wonderful DVD:
-------------------------------------------------
1.  Excellent quality- The reproduction on DVD is super clear. Considering the show was produced in the 1960's, the color and clarity are awesome!

2.  Engaging storyline- The premise of the show and every episode was done with alot of creativity and supports the show's storyline/premise very well.  Each episode has a feel as if it can stand alone as a mini-movie.  The show is broken down into 4 Acts and an Epilogue (ending, summary).  Well done with the segments!

3.  Great acting and well-known superstars-Roy Thinnes as the main character suits the show perfectly and his acting couldn't have been done better by any other actor.  Alot of actors made appearances on episodes in Season 1 like Vanessa Redgrave, and other actors. I would name more actors/actresses but its more a suprise seeing who appears on that episode as its playing.

4.  Great extras- Interview with Roy Thinnes, optional introduction by him available for each episode, ""Beachhead"" Extended Pilot Episode ( Disregard the fact that this may not have been the longer one that was produced). Other reviewers knock this for not being included, but no one is perfect!, and 3 Season 1 promos.

Reason to not own this DVD:
---------------------------

ABSOLUTELY NOT A SINGLE REASON!!!

This show is a must owned DVD for any true Sci-fi fan.  Considering the lack of the crazy technology and high tech products that are produced in today's day and age, the producers and creators did a wonderful job of the laser gun and disappearing of the aliens when killed.

This show set a precedent of all sci-fi shows of today. Shows like the X-Files wouldn't have been possible had it not been for this show.

A true 5-star rating and own it today!

I will certainly purchase Season 2 when it eventually becomes available.",1213315200,4,2349,4.802992518703242
3335410,4,B0012Z36EO,"I am delighted to be able to watch The Invaders again with this DVD release.  The Invaders was one of the two Sci-Fi TV series which I remembered most from my early teen years - the other being The Time Tunnel.  I received The Invaders DVD's last week, while The Time Tunnel (both volumes) had been in my collection for over a year now.  My little comment is thus on a comparison between the two.

Both releases faithfully bring back the episodes; the stories, the background music/noise, and the mood I recalled having enjoyed. Being able to hear and watch Roy Thinnes in person again is very nice.  David Vincent; being the sole character working often alone in many of the episodes, however, does make him kind of lonely in the interview.  The Time Tunnel, managed to get hold of more of the crew: Doug Philips, Tony Newman and Ann MacGregor, made a more happy reunion.

While it might be icing on the cake, the availability of subtitle in The Time Tunnel would, I believe, allows more senior and less privileged people to enjoy the show more fully.  It is one thing I always want to see with new DVD releases.

I am looking forward to the next release of The Invaders DVD, and more specials and delightful surprises along with it.",1213228800,,1234,4.5225225225225225
3335411,4,B0012Z36EO,"Name your ""X-Files"" mantra:""UFOs-I believe"",""Trust no one"" or ""The Truth is out there Somewhere"".All of these and more apply to the Invaders,first broadcast in the early winter of 1967. If you liked the ""X-Files"" you'll love this show. This is one of my favourite TV shows of all time.
The show follows the exploits of architect David Vincent who one night on a lonely road witnesses the landing of a space craft. Of course even his closest friend doesn't believe him and soon after he finds out,much to his amazement,that the aliens are among us and are trying to take over the earth. He goes from episode to episode trying to find and defeat the aliens any which way he can and trying to convince a skeptical public of what he knows. He makes headway little by little gaining some converts here and there but knows he can't stop until the entire world knows the truth of what is happening.
The show had high production values throughout and Roy Thinnes who plays David Vincent is superb in his role. He is also more than ably supported by top notch stars and a myriad of supporting actors in every episode. As in the ""X-Files"",this show also maintains that constant atmosphere of tension and dread every moment which made the show so appealing in 1967 and still does today.
It is interesting to note the special effects used throughout the series. The biggies were the landing and taking off the space craft and the
death of the aliens themselves,who would dissolve in a sea of red. Other effects were minimalistic but VERY effective. For example the human appearing aliens would often have to regenerate themselves,if they didn't they would start glowing. To enhance this aspect the actors would raise their hands to their faces which held,unseen in their palms,a light which would enhance the glowing. Other small things like dressing in blue cover-alls or dark suits,or the way the actors portraying aliens would give a simple but solemn look. The mutated fourth finger which caused their pinkies to stick out was also a very simple thing to achieve. All these things and more simply enhanced the feel and look of the show.
Each epsiode was done in four acts with an epilog and had a spoken intro and final wrap up dialogue at the end. The series music was done by none other than Dominic Frontiere well know for his work on the original""Outer Limits"".
Looking on the technical side of things we unfortunately find a bit of a let down,which is why the four star rating.
First this show is NOT remastered but definitely should have been. These were transferred from existing masters and the earlier eps especially show major colour differences/deficiencies associated with film that old. The transfer is adequate and fairly crisp but a good remastering from the original film elements with colour correction(much needed in parts where the colour is washed out or faded)and a good clean up would have made these look beautiful,like the great job done on""The Wild,Wild West"" series. For example some shows like ""The Time Tunnel"" have not been remastered either,but look incredibly clean and crisp as if they had been. Others not remastered but BADLY needing it are shows like ""McHale's Navy"" and ""The Addams Family"".It all depends in what shape the masters are in.
Secondly,and more disturbing, is the teeny tiny fine print on the back of the DVD case which says:""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"".This could mean ALOT of things. I looked closely at each one. Two things I found stand out. Any signs with a brand name product on it have been blurred out;and the end credit has been changed to reflect the new ownership of this product to Spelling Entertainment(2008) replacing the old Quinn Martin logo and date. There are many incidents of incidental music throughout these eps also and considering the way many companies these days,for some reason,seem to be replacing what was on there originally with a newer score,this MAY also be another area of editing.
Considering that this set hasn't been remastered I doubt very much whether the second and last season will be either. But I hope that the format this one has follows into the next. That is,Roy Thinnes himself is there to introduce each and every episode in his own inimitable fashion! It was a surprise but a REAL joy to see him on screen and see that he is looking very well. As an aside I recall that Mr. Thinnes after the show ended became very popular on the UFO convention circuit. The mid-60s was witness to a huge UFO flap and this show attracted many of those who witnessed and believed in the phenomenon. They could identify with the character who was always at constant odds with a disbelieving authority.
Also included in this set are special commentary tracks,an interview with Roy Thinnes(which I can't wait to see) and the rare extended pilot version of the first ep ""Beachhead"".The latter contains alot of deleted and extended scenes the originally aired version doesn't and is ultimately the better and more satisfying of the two. A great edition to the set.
In conclusion this the progenitor of the ""X-Files"",which has finally made it to DVD(a 5-disc set),will not disappoint anyone interested in that show,old fans of ""The Invaders"",the alien angle or just good Sci-Fi drama period. It made a huge impact on a lot of people,including myself, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. It is a shame that it was not remastered and cleaned up the way it should have been but the prints here are adequate and fairly crisp.

3335415,5,B0012Z36EO,"I was in junior high the year the series started (it was the same season that the original Star Trek began.) Lost in Space had begun the year before, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea the year before that, and around that time The Time Tunnel also appeared. My friends and I would talk about the show enthusiastically the next day after each new episode. I hadn't seen a single episode since it went off the air in 1968.

I've now seen the first season which was just released on DVD. I find these to be quite enjoyable. The stories were interesting (for the most part), the effects stand up just fine even in today's world of CGI, and the acting cannot be beat.

Roy Thinnes, playing the lead character, does an excellent job as a man trying to find irrefutable evidence of the presence and intent of the invading aliens. Many of the guest stars were top names in that day. Even the background character actors are well-recognized by anyone familiar with TV in the 1960's. The show made creative use of many photogenic locales in the L.A. area though of course studio sets were also utilized.

I thought the writers made the stories more believable by having credible characters believe Vincent (Thinnes' character) and even try to help him or work with him. Vincent endeavors to get official recognition and intervention, but at times has to settle for minor victories over these creatures.

One of the credited story creators (Cohen) provides a commentary on one episode.  Unfortunately, much of what he says relates to his resume of other shows and experiences having nothing to do with The Invaders. I think it would have worked much better to have Thinnes provide a commentary for at least a few of these. It's always fun to hear little anecdotes and trivia that only someone on the set can provide.

I thought most of the episode transfers were ""good"", though not as consistently clear and pristine as I've seen with other sci-fi shows from the 60's that made it onto DVD. Still, they tracked down the original pilot in a longer version and have included that among bonus features. Also, there is a great interview with Mr. Thinnes and he briefly introduces each episode.

Overall, I'm ecstatic they have released this series on DVD. It is a slice of Americana from the 1960's. Watching all those beautiful old cars (when they were new!) and styles and fashions from that period was very nostalgic. I don't think you'll regret buying the set.

3335416,5,B0012Z36EO,"Other reviewers have already done a great job of describing the basics about this DVD set, so I'll focus on one aspect that really hasn't been covered yet.

If there is one component of the Invaders that played a pivotal role in making it not only one of the most frightening TV shows of the 60's but also the most memorable and quite honestly perhaps one the very best, it would have to be the theme music.

Having now watched some of the season 1 box set, it has been brought all back again after not being viewed for such a long time. And the theme music by Dominic Frontiere truly set this series apart from almost everything else at the time.

Not coincidentally, one of the other most frightening tv shows of this time period was ""The Outer Limits"" also scored by Dominic Frontiere.
The music of course is quite eerie but also draws you into the deep horror that is felt by the main characters. It makes the events on screen effect the viewer in a much more compelling way. It places you right there with the events as they unfold. I think because Frontiere is so sparse with the music. Just a few notes is all it takes. Long drawn out chords but deftly placed and never overplayed. Deep bass strings and horns can always set the proper mood for horror and sci-fi. Understated, subdued yet incredibly powerful yet never overpowering what is seen on the screen. Dominic Frontiere certainly sets the mood properly and makes this one of the most unforgettable shows you'll ever watch.

Not many other TV series are better than this one. We've all waited so long for the ""The Invaders"" to finally return to earth. And bringing the stories the characters and that great music back to us, after so long unheard but ALWAYS remembered.",1212364800,6,1733,4.527156549520766

Second, the cast of guest actors/actresses is great. Mostly familiar faces later seen in motion pictures.

Third, a lot of the filming is outdoors in various locations instead of mostly indoors, on sets, or the LA area, like Mission Impossible and some of the others.

3335419,4,B0012Z36EO,"I rate this excellent DVD box set four stars for being an outstanding video transfer.  I am enjoying viewing these DVD's on a modern large screen HDTV played by an upward compatible DVD player. This is a much better viewing experience than watching THE INVADERS on an old B&W set in the late 60's.  The picture is crisp, the colors are vibrant and the sound is excellent.

I was an addict of the THE INVADERS TV series during my third year in engineering school and even stood up to the college crowd which was in love with STAR-TREK, the newest sci-fi series.  I felt that STAR-TREK was just another of the popular TV fads with the college crowd (e.g., BATMAN). However, I was soon to be a convert as I found that THE INVADERS was always going places but never really getting anywhere.  Week after week we saw similar plots on THE INVADERS and after a while it started to grow a little thin.

When real boredom set in, and after some prodding by my college friends I had to turn the dial to see STAR TREK, which was aired during an overlapping time slot. After sampling the different interesting themes that were explored by STAR TREK I had to admit that THE INVADERS was worth giving up.  However, I would have continued watching THE INVADERS in hopes of some progress if only it had it been aired during a different time slot.

I still enjoyed THE INVADERS, and hope to see the second season box set available before too long.  By the time the second season came along in the late 60's I was too busy watching STAR TREK to care.  However, I may be able to catch it the second time around in a DVD release.

On the commentary side, THE INVADERS comes from an earlier more innocent era when Air Force Intelligence, the FBI and our CIA were always considered to be the good guys in films, out fighting for truth and justice in addition to our national security.

UPDATE - Recently, while watching an INVADERS episode I never saw on TV entitled ""Innocent"" I was surprised to learn that its script could have been used as the basis of the X-Files episode ""TBD"".  MORE TO COME.",1212105600,,2074,4.426315789473684

They got Roy Thinnes to do episode introductions and an interview; they included some original network promos and bumpers; and they found and included a 60-minute unaired version of the pilot episode, which contains additional and expanded scenes, fleshing out the story and its periferal characters.

What's wrong here is the time-sped version of the aired pilot (and only that episode).  All of the others are at the correct speed.  There's also some questionable film elements used.  Episode 4, ""The Leeches"", for example has a small section of the episode that looks sourced from a 16mm print.  As such, the release comes off as looking rushed - not quite finished to perfection.

Produced by Quinn Martin (""The Fugitive"")and created by Larry Cohen, ""The Invaders"" took elements from Martin's most popular series ""The Fugitive"" and successfully created a paranoid science fiction thriller that inspired later shows like ""The X-Files"", ""Dark Skies"" and ""The 4400"".

SPOILERS:

Architect David Vincent(Roy Thinnes)stops to rest after a long drive back from a meeting with a client when he witnesses an alien spacecraft land in the middle of nowhere. When he reports it to the local police he's treated with distain  by a detective (the wonderful character actor J.D. Cannon)and finds that even his own business partner (James Daly) has a hard time believing him. They encounter a couple on their honeymoon who completely discount Vincent's account of the landing. Going back to the site to speak with the couple again Vincent discovers that they are aliens themselves and part of a large conspiracy that has infiltrated every part of our society.

END OF SPOILERS:

We get some very cool extras that fans will enjoy. On the last disc is the long missing 60 minute pilot episode. While it doesn't look quite as good as the series itself with faded colors, it still looks surprisingly good without any restoration. The longer pilot had a number of brief scenes that were cut prior to the airing of the show including a slightly different ending.

Roy Thinnes provides an introduction to each episode including the unaired pilot. He also sits for a nearly 30 minute interview discussing how he became involved with the show, the numerous guest stars he worked with (he essentially was the only regular on the show (aside from the unseen episode narrator William Woodson and introductory narrator Hank Simms)as he was always traveling to uncover hot spots where the invaders were up to no good). Characters did show up in multiple episodes but Thinnes carries the show.

It's easy to see where ""The X-Files"" got its inspiration from. Thinnes praises the writers for the show as well as the directors (the first two episodes where directed by TV and film veteran Joseph Sargant who does a terrific job of setting up shots with cinematographer Andrew MacIntyre creating moody and magnificient atmosphere during the first episodes that rival ""The Outer Limits"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" at their best.

We also get three promo spots produced by ABC for the series. The promos are essentially clip jobs with narration describing the series. They are still very nice to have in this set.

Thinnes also discusses everything from the challenge of creating aliens that burn up on demand to shooting on location. He also shares a story that I haven't heard before about seeing a UFO himself with his wife shortly before the show aired.

Larry Cohen's commentary on ""The Innocent"" is quite good. He shares production stories, ideas he had for the second season that didn't come to fruitation including giving Vincent a sense of humor and a life outside his pursuit of the aliens.

The first season set looks exceptionally good given the age of the series. Although images are a bit soft the color is surprisingly strong and bold. During the episode ""The Leeches"" there was a brief but very noticable drop in image quality and it looked as if the producers had to use a dupe several generations away from the original. There's occasional bits of specs that show up but that's not really a surprise given the age of the show. It doesn't effect the quality of the set either way. The mono audio sounds really good with dialogue crystal clear. Interestingly, series composer Dominic Frontier who also did the music for the first season of ""The Outer Limits"" cannibalizes music from that series for the pilot episode.

Often seen as a Cold War metaphor, ""The Invaders"" is far more than that. The writing is superb and the episodes resonate because of the skilled direction and exceptional, believable lead performance by Thinnes. While it would be a stretch to say this series had a ""story arc"" like most modern TV shows, there is a sketchy one which is that Vincent sets out to find proof and expose the invaders. They, in turn, want to eliminate him because he's one of the few crusaders trying to uncover their plot to take over our world.

Overall Paramount/CBS has done a superb job bringing this classic series to TV. I'm surprised at how well it has held up with most of the writing/direction/acting top notch. Featuring well known guest stars such as William Windom, Harold Gould, Roddy MacDowell, Suzanne Pleshette, Ed Begley, Dabney Coleman and Michael Rennie during its brief two year run, ""The Invaders"" was an exceptionally good series with cool visual effects but, more importantly, well written stories that could drawn an audience into the world of David Vicent.

I'm hoping that the second season set will see the 1995 TV mini-series that starred Scott Bakula included (although that did have a separate home video release) and, perhaps, we can get more interview time with Thinnes about shooting season two.",1211587200,24,5133,4.925925925925926
3335422,5,B0012Z36EO,"I have updated my review of THE INVADERS.

The film transfers appear to be from 35mm positive prints, rather than the original negatives.  There is some grain & too much film dust.
The episodes have been slightly sped up to run 49 minutes instead of 51 minutes.  The theory is that these are from the European PAL transfers where their projectors run at 25 frames per second (as opposed to our 24 frames stretched to 30).  Roy Thinnes says this show is very popular in France where it is in syndication.  This is probably the source material.

Still, these look better than they originally did on first airing.

The 27:25 long interview with Roy Thinnes is very informative, giving us insight on how he got involved with the series & some of his memories with the other actors.
BUT I would suggest not watching the individual show intros that he does as he talks about the plot of the episode, and gives no insight about its production.  I think it is better to let the episodes tell the story first, then watch the intro after.

-Original Review-

Some reviewers here talked about the poor region 2 DVD case.  I want to re-assure U.S. buyers that the region 1 case does NOT have overlapping discs. The slightly thicker keepcase has two swinging holders inside that store two discs on opposite sides of each other.  The 5th disc is stored on the inside back of the case.

The clear case has a two-sided insert that gives the episode information (showing through the clear case) on the inside of the case.

There are 5 single-sided discs.
The 17 episodes have new introductions by Roy Thinnes. ***SKIP OVER THIS INTRO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE EPISODES*** .  Roy just gives you some of the plot and no insite about the making of the episode.
Disclaimer on the back:""Some Episodes may be altered from their original network versions"".  This is generic and does not give specific information, and it does not say they actually are edited.  I have nothing to compare the episodes to.

The episodes are COMPLETE, running 49 minutes each.  Not cut down 45 minute syndication versions as some have rumored.

Bonus: 3 season 1 promos.

I did a quick view of a disc 5 episode WALL OF CRYSTAL and am happy to report that CBS retained the original ""COMING UP NEXT: THE INVADERS, IN COLOR"" introduction bumper!  The transfers are crisp & the colors well balanced. The only time I noticed film dust was during the process matte shots, and this is inherent in the negative from when the special effects were done.

However the transfer of the next episode has dust appearing quite frequently, so the quiality varies.

The episodes are broken up into chapters so that you can quit at any commercial break and quickly jump to the next segment when you are ready to watch again.  There is a mute Invaders bumper at the end where the original sponsorship would have been announced.  The ABC logo at the end has been replaced with a CBS logo (not a CBS Paramount logo).

The three season 1 promos show what the series would look like un-restored, a little grainy with negative dust.

Of Note, Roy makes a comment at the end of his interview about the popularity of THE INVADERS in France, where it is syndicated on television.",1211241600,39,3992,4.470994475138122
3335423,3,B0012Z36EO,"This show has only seen a limited, and incomplete
release before on a series of 12 VHS tapes by
""Goodtimes"" in 1988. There was one episode per tape,
each of varying print quality. The order of the
episodes on tape was seemingly random, and based more
on who the guest stars for the episode might be rather
than series continuity. The tapes were only released
in extended play mode, which when combined with poor
quality prints did not make for a pretty picture.

This new DVD set is an improvement over the VHS tapes,
but that's not saying too much. Judging from the two
episodes I've watched ( the first episode, ""Beachhead""
and ""The Experiment"" ) I would guess that these
episodes have been converted from the masters created
for the British releases. I base this supposition on
the fact that the soundtracks are pitched up slightly
faster than the American tapes; a common occurence due
to the different frame rate between PAL and NTSC.

The prints are better than the ones used for the VHS
releases, but are not neccesarily of consistent
quality. They are definitely NOT newly struck prints
from the original negatives, nor has there been any
digital clean-up done. The soundtracks are simple mono
which means that, on the positive side, there has been
no untoward monkeying around with the audio. On the
negative side ( or positive, if you're into nostalgia ),
this gives you about the same quality of sound as
you might have heard if you saw these episodes in
syndication.

Comparing my old ""Goodtimes"" VHS copy with the DVD
version of the second episode ( ""The Experiment"" ).
there do not appear to be any noticeable syndication
cuts. BUT BE WARNED; In microscopic type on the back
of the DVD case there is a disclaimer which reads,
""Some episodes may be edited from their original
network editions"". I have my suspicions that the
episode version of ""Beachhead"" may be one of those
that are""...edited from their original network
versions"", which is truly unforgiveable in a
commercial DVD release.

One positive bonus to this set is that a copy of the
full 60 minute pilot version of ""Beachhead"" was
located and included on disc five. The pilot version
contains about fifteen minutes of footage not in the
broadcast version. Entire scenes that were excised are
included, as well as a different end title sequence.
Also of note is some differing footage of a disguised
alien starting to glow as his rejuvenation time
approches. The shots included in the pilot, while
definitely filmed at the same time as the aired
version, might have been considered slightly more
unsettling to television viewers back in the sixties,
so the more subdued shots with the alien's hands
partially blocking his face were inserted ( this is
just my own theory, but I must admit that I was caught
off guard by the original footage, which seemed a bit
creepier to me - although VERY tame, by today's
standards ).

Another nice bonus are three vintage series promos,
plus episode intros by - and an interview with -
series star Roy Thinnes ( although it tends to ramble
a bit, and doesn't provide a whole lot of in-depth
info on the making of the series ).

This DVD set is far from perfect and will be somewhat
disappointing to those hoping for a loving restoration
of the episodes, but it is better than nothing
( especially for someone like me, who never got to see
the show when it originally aired, or even during it's
short run on the Sci FI Channel during the early '90s ).
So if you're interested in the series I can definitely
recommend the set, but if you're looking for the ultimate
version, this ain't it ( but sadly, it's probably the best
we're gonna get ).",1211068800,23,3653,4.6645962732919255

Produced by Quinn Martin, the man who produced great hit series as ""The Fugitive"" and ""The FBI"" it should have been a hit. Today it is a cult classic. Roy Thinnes portrayal is similar to David Janssen's Fugitive, as one man on a mission. Thinnes character architect David Vincent, while driving late one night sees a Alien ship landing. He begins his quest to tell the world. The problem is that the aliens have taken human form and are very intelligent. The only way to tell them from humans is a deformity on some of the aliens which is a pinky finger that will not bend with the rest of the fingers. The aliens do not bleed and they incinerate after being killed. On a limited 60's TV budget the special effects are not outstanding, but its the brilliant acting that makes the show. Great actors like James Daly, Jack Lord, and Suzanne Pleshette. For those who have never seen this show it is worth the effort to buy it. Enjoy!",1206316800,4,1225,4.37719298245614
3335429,5,B0012Z36EO,"The 42 one-hour episodes of the science fiction series ""The Invaders"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1967-1968.  That might seem like just one season but the series was a midseason replacement, which premiered in January 1967.  The season one DVD set includes only the 16 episodes produced to fill out the remainder of ABC's 1966-67 broadcast season.

Like ""The Prisoner"" which also premiered in 1967,  ""The Invaders"" has become a mega cult hit over the years and this DVD package is greatly anticipated.  The series has its roots in 1950's paranoia science fiction, specifically those films (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""It Came From Outer Space"", ""Invasion From Mars"") that were surrogates for the anti-Communist hysteria that swept the country during the early Eisenhower era.

""The Invaders"" took up the old theme of finding the enemy in our midst and was a worthy successor to the classic anti-Communist series ""I Led Three Lives""  (1953-1956).  But the anti-Red phobia was no longer a draw by 1967 so the series confined itself to aliens from outer space and drew few parallels to those folks from behind the Iron Curtain.  It did exploit the growing distrust of American business and government leaders by showing alien infiltration of these sectors.

Ray Thinnes plays architect David Vincent who stumbles across a spacecraft of disembarking aliens one night.  They are from a dying planet and have come to colonize the earth.  Their strategy is to infiltrate society by taking the form of humans, but like the robots of ""Westworld"" they have a little problem with their hands (or in this case with a bent pinky finger).  They also have no heartbeat as a consequence of having no heart.  And when they die their bodies rapidly evaporate, leaving no trace for Vincent to prove his claims to the authorities.

Vincent becomes a latter day Paul Revere, riding around trying to spread the alarm to a citizenry that dismiss him as a nut case.  He is never able to bring physical proof of his claims to anyone important.  The aliens do not kill him because his death might make his story more believable so they monitor his activities and do their best to thwart his various schemes.

Each episode was structured as a four-act play with commercial breaks between acts and an epilogue. Quinn Martin regular William Conrad provided a narration.  Conrad also did narration for ""The Fugitive"".  During its run ""The Invaders"" became more and more like ""The Fugitive"" because the original concept offered the writers no where else to go.  There were only so many ways Vincent could fail to warn people of the aliens and should he successfully convince the world of the invasion the series would end.  So like Richard Kimble he becomes a man on the run who episodically meets up with new people each week.  This takes away from the original idea of an alien invasion.

The acting is generally first rate and the music lively and distinctive.  Production design is standard Quinn Martin, the occasional sci-fi devices are meant to be taken seriously and are not the self-parody stuff of 1960's sci-fi series like ""Lost In Space"" and ""The Time Tunnel"".

I have waited for this show for a long time and I am glad that I will now be able to watch all of the episodes that are availible.

That list has many science fiction series on it (the original Star Trek being one among many), but this series stands out because of its great production values (for the time), great performances, and the air of paranoia that shows like this must have to be believable.

Roy Thinnes played David Vincent, an otherwise ordinary fellow, an architect by profession, who happens to make the horrible discovery that we have been invaded by beings from another planet who have taken the appearance of being human, and whose intentions are to take over the planet. This sets in motion Vincent's lonely (at least in the first season) quest to root out and thwart the invaders' plans for world domination.

Thinnes hit the right note as a regular guy finding himself in extraordinary circumstances, and show producer Quinn Martin, having also produced The Fugitive, knew how to frame a series based around a lone wanderer who is destined to hunt and be hunted. The loneliness and isolation experienced by Vincent is very similar to that felt by the Fugitive's Richard Kimble.

There were some great guest stars in the 2 seasons this ran, like Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell, Dabney Coleman and many familiar faces from the David Janssen ""Fugitive"" series. Quinn Martin Productions had a sort of ""favorites"" list for casting guest stars and supporting players, and it is fun spotting them in various shows produced by QM. Anyhow, my recommendation is to watch these shows a few at a time, not in a marathon. Remember, this is not like LOST, where back to back viewing reveals small details.

Original review : I am hopeful that the US DVD version of the Invaders will be done right by Paramount.  Although I was glad to see season one released here in Australia some months ago, there was no 75 minute version of Beachhead (as originally broadcast) or any extras. Roy Thinnes is still an articulate advocate and commentator on the series, and in cases like this, there might only be one chance 'to get it right'. In my view, DVD extras are likely to have historical signifance for future generations, and similarly, there is a need to preserve the most complete and best quality episodes available. Having said all that, the picture quality of the Season One episodes released here in Oz were pretty good. However, I do not know if they are uncut. This series is a well loved and remembered show for baby boomers such as myself, and season two is eagerly anticipated!
