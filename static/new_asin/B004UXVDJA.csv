4473625,1,B004UXVDJA,"I have watched all episodes to date and I've enjoyed the show until ""Forgive us our trespasses.""  I've appreciated that this series has NOT been a living, breathing response to whatever the current political climate is, but this week they blew it.  :(  If they continue to do this, I'll stop watching and stop recommending it as a decent drama.",1313020800,2,344,4.7
4473626,5,B004UXVDJA,"Most series go into a decline by the fourth season but there are ocassionally a few that do keep your interest beyond the fourth or fifth season. Very few improve. Closer is one that does. The seventh season finds the great cast clicking like a machine, with all the quirks of the characters we have come to care about continuing (I do miss Daniels and was sorry to see her go). The scripts are a nice mixture of drama and comedy as we have come to expect from Closer.  The show revolves around Kyra Sedgwick, the head of the Major Crimes division, but several episodes allow the cast members to take center stage. Very nice. This is the best season yet. If you like Closer at all you will really like this season.

The first time I remember seeing Kyra Sedgwick was in Tai-Pan in 1986, who would have expected that young lady to evolve into this gorgeous woman. She just keeps getting better looking every year.

The eight season is scheduled to be the last, I expect they will go out on a high note. Perhaps leacve some room for a movie or two down the line.",1312675200,98,1060,4.343434343434343
4473627,1,B004UXVDJA,"Just as the Stock market Crashed, Episode 4 crashed a few days earlier!
 The 4th episode was a JOKE. No man is going to kill his own flesh and blood son to make his ex wife mad, thats STUPID! If anything you'll kill the ex wife, she's the one you cant stand. Just horrible writing, absolutley horrible.  Maybe it will get back to where the show is capable of being at.
Already I see the negative comments and all, I mean come on People! I love the Closer too but lets be real, when an episode sucks...it sucks!  Why be so fake to always give it 5 stars.",1312416000,,553,4.101851851851852
4473628,4,B004UXVDJA,"maybe it is time to say goodbye. The Closer acts all cold as ice that she dropped off that thug who then got murdered, she can care less. The 4th episode was a JOKE.

I look forward to the up coming season but I am also sad that this is their last season. What am I going to do next summer without the closer? I hope they change their minds, this is too good of a show to end so soon!",1310428800,3,391,4.0256410256410255

In this final season, Brenda finds herself in hot water (how come it took her 7 seasons?) and leadership is changing, but the tight-knit squad continues to work together, providing light moments as well as serious ones. It's a tribute to the quality of the writing that the situations continue to be believable and suspenseful, and the ultimate solution always makes sense.

4474082,4,B004UXVDJA,"Good, but I didn't likek the script of having 'The Closer"" loose it and being out of control.  It just didn't fit her character.  I know they had to have a reason to close out the series, but really?  Of course, she supposedly got her man.",1438300800,,239,4.1521739130434785
4474083,5,B004UXVDJA,"Having finally worked through my DVD backlog of The Closer I can honestly say Ill be sad to see it go- or is it really going?  Other reviewers have commented on the fact that this season seems less like a farewell and more like a set-up for the spin-off series, Major Crimes (which I have not seen but note that theyve been renewed by TNT for a 4th season this fall).
  The showrunners dilemma began once the charismatic and beautiful star, Kyra Sedgwick, decided to pull the plug on The Closer despite continuing strong and growing ratings.  How to wrap things up?  When they decided to continue on with the bulk of the engaging supporting cast (minus Chief Pope, Detective Gabriel and Brenda of course) who would lead them?  Picking Mary McDonnells Captain Sharon Raydor character was an interesting choice.  Having only appeared in a handful of earlier episodes she was Brendas nemesis and her squad had no love for her (Provenza and Flynn draw a stick figure of her as a witch in on a white board in a season 6 episode).  The catalyst for the shakeup pivots on an uncharacteristic morally and ethically poor decision Brenda makes in Season 6.  This action results in the death of a gang member and subsequent civil suit by the deceaseds family.  While the notion of the despicable self-confessed murderer (who managed to get an immunity agreement) receiving some street justice is satisfying it never seemed true to Chief Johnsons personality and thus unlikely.
  A lot of energy during this season goes into rehabilitating Capt Raydors persona to be more likeable to the Major Crimes team and more importantly, to the audience.  So we get lots of Raydor, shes always around the murder room, shes following a suspect and helps the team take him down including a between the eyes shot with a bean bag shot gun round that impresses the guys.  All-in-all its quite a makeover by the finale.
  So, I wish Kyra much luck, she made Deputy Chief Johnson a fun character to watch (and remember the squad wasn't too wild about her when Will Pope brought her to L.A. in the first season, I think Provenza called her Scarlett OHara).  Mary McDonnell looks good in a tailored sheath dress too but whether shes got the charm to fill Sedgwicks heels and make this work is hard to picture.  That said, Ive got Season 1 of Major Crimes on DVD to see for myself.",1438300800,,2349,4.632850241545894

Although I'm a little put off by the network's bending over backward to be politically correctseems like every chief or assistant chief is a woman (Castle, etc.), which is fine if it were actually reflecting reality rather than simply kissing up to political correctnessI think Kyra Sedgwick (Brenda) has created one of the best female characters on TV. The Closer is well written and has a strong supporting cast. Season 7 ended the series on a very high note. Congrats to all involved. I think it earned 5 stars.",1425081600,,564,4.707070707070707

We found 'The Closer' in syndicated reruns on a local TV channel, but Prime streaming is ever so much faster and better suited to a 'Closer' marathon. Sadly the sequel isn't yet available on either streaming or in local TV syndication.

A superb showcase of talent and love, I am so pleased to be able to access it here. After following it from the beginning, this show managed to capture each character in an organic way having me convinced they were real people. I had to constantly remind myself it was television drama. One person who played her role to a T is Frances Sternhagen who played Brenda's mom. We get to see her always smoothing over the rough surfaces without ever sacrificing her sweet and genuine nature, the way you would expect a woman of her era to behave. Even at the worst moments, her ability to ensure everyone is appreciated and cared for to preserve their personal dignity wins her the role of true heroine in my estimation. The bittersweet lead up to the finale is poignant and true to life, as per usual in this series. Hands down though, it was Kyra Sedgwick's performance that captured me from the start. What talent in this woman. Every little nuance, every expression, even the way she would always be examining the faces of those she was speaking to. Watch her eyes when she is engaged with others, whether in an interrogation or just in the presence of others and talking. You see her looking not just at their eyes, but at their whole face, especially watching their mouths. Very intriguing to me. I love this show.",1419984000,,1458,4.568702290076335

I have the entire blu-ray set, and I've watched it all the way through many times.  It'll last forever if taken care of.  If you haven't ever watched it, start with the first season and get to know the wonderful characters, which is one of the reasons this show has touched my heart.  There is wonderful humor and tense drama.  You may have to overlook Brenda's (played brilliantly by Kyra Sedgewick) sappy southern accent until you get used to it!  lol  Awesome season - awesome show!

4474929,5,B004UXVDJA,"The last season was the best, i think, except for the death of Brenda Leigh's mother. I love frances sternhagan--she caught my eye many years ago in a little known sci-fi movie called OUTLAND, and I've followed her work ever since. But the the whole cast, especially Flynn and Provenza, provided some comic relief by getting themselves in tons of compro-mising situations. I would also like to commend the acting work done by Kyra's daughter, Sosie Bacon--I wasn't expecting much, and she surprised me with her stage presence in HER scenes. It certainly proves that the apple didn't fall far from the tree, and I think Sosie has a bright career ahead of her, if she really wants it. In short, this season provided the best that ALL of the series regulars could offer and you will not be disapponted in watching the entire season.",1418515200,,829,4.724137931034483

I'm just an ordinary viewer; no acting experience; no movie  industry summer job while in school; don't even know any TV actors.
However, the characters in this project; I did feel like (on some level that)  I knew them, because they were so genuine.
I realize no one show is going to be accepted by all the viewers out there - yet this project really did get many viewers.

as to the cast members involved they all took a back seat to ms sedgwick. it was her show and i am sure she had handled the duties of executive producer properly.  this was a fun show.  not real in any way but quite entertaining all the time.  i still don't know who exactly played her husband Fritz but he did rather well in a supporting role also.

4475195,5,B004UXVDJA,"It is such a pleasure to have all seven seasons of this truly outstanding and unique show -- a television program that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with the medium's all-time greatest crime series, and probably with all series regardless of the genre. What the producers, directors, actors, and, above all, WRITERS created with this riveting ensemble drama is an atmospheric and thoroughly entertaining 7-season masterwork that shows us all how good television can be ... when the stars align and immense talent and charisma come together across-the-board.

Over the years, I have rarely discovered a television program wherein I absolutely and undeniably loved and cheered for every single member of the main cast. 'The Closer' inspired that kind of ""viewer enthusiasm"" in me, and, believe me, no one on this planet is more jaded about the state of contemporary popular television (and film and music, for that matter) than am I. Just watching the opening credits and sequences was always enough to put a smile on my face, without me even realizing it. For an hour a week, I felt captivated by Brenda Leigh Johnson, the scattered, lovely, flawed, feisty, ultra-feminine and gifted Southern Belle transplanted to La La Land to tackle and solve some of the most gruesome (and often gruesomely funny) murders the City of Angels had to offer. The sheer contrast between Brenda Leigh's dyed-in-the-wool Atlanta charm & provincial values and the chaotic rootlessness of Los Angeles life made for a constantly compelling ambience wherein she HAD to be the underdog, wherein she had to scrape and scrounge and use every wit and wile at her disposal to get the job done, and in doing so she never looked like anything less than a Lady, despite her very real personal deficiencies and character flaws. That alone is just plain great television.

But I equally loved Flynn and Provenza, the crusty old detectives whose gruff exteriors and epic misadventures (the Stewardess Episode and the Jennifer Coolidge Episode were particularly hysterical) belied their devotion and prowess as members of the squad. I loved Lt. Gabriel, whose boy-scout loyalty and decorum were cleverly offset by his own complexity as a man who could let his own ambitions get in the way when he wasn't looking. I loved Tao, with his gentle spirit and earnest compulsion to overshare when it came to his encyclopedic knowledge of EVERYTHING. I loved Sanchez, who was tough enough to have taken the whole world's troubles on his shoulders, but who always looked like a lost little kid who might explode in a fit more frightening than a force of nature at any moment. I loved Pope and Commander Taylor, the two bureaucrats who really want to do the right thing for everyone so long as it doesn't interfere with the right thing for them, and even then they usually found a way out of their own personal manifestations of immaturity. I loved Captain Raydor (who now helms the spin-off, 'Major Crimes') because her tranquil, by-the-book, lurker ""attitude"" made me dislike her intensely at first, but when she revealed glimpses of the fact that she could be the best friend anyone on the squad could ever have on their side, I believed this character was the real deal. I loved Fritz, the voice of reason and calm, the rock who only loved his Lady and wanted the best for her, despite the pressures of his own, often competitive, work demands and ulterior motives. I loved the recurring characters of Brenda's Mama and Daddy -- they provided not only a crucial link to an understanding of how Brenda actually turned out to be the woman she was, but they added an always-welcome dose of wisdom and innocence amid the edge-of-your-seat drama.

Mostly, I tip my hat to the writers of this award-winning show. They kept it fresh and evocative every week, they never seemed to show the magician's hand moving to put the rabbit into the hat, which could easily have happened give the built-in conceit that someone or something in every episode was going to flip the switch in the lightbulb-of-genius above Brenda's head and lead her to solve the crime (usually). The scripts were gripping, fluent, witty, well-plotted, accessible, and intelligent without ever making audiences feel as if they were not ""in on the fun"" (or the fear) along with the squad. The cinematography was always capable of panoramic scope and comforting intimacy, from one scene to another, and it is a testament to great direction and technical agility on the part of the crew that LA was as much a ""regular"" cast member as the members of major crimes.

The piece de resistance is that the 7th season was almost as good as the first, groundbreaking season. The seasons in between are excellent, too, but for a program of this type to make its swan-song season, the one that sends-off the central character, such a tour-de-force of cohesive drama, suspense, humor, pathos, and ultimate resolution is quite an achievement. To everyone's credit, Brenda left at the top of her game and the program had a chance to hopefully become a completely different animal without losing a step or suffering too much by comparison.

There are two final things that I loved most about this marvelous series. 1. It had heart. Amid all the grim subject material and its depiction of human degradation, the show had heart, and it let us know this each week without needing to wear that heart on its sleeve. Never sentimental, The Closer communicated heart through hard lessons, and eloquent ones. 2. Not once in this series did I ever feel that some preachy, overarching political agenda or partisan lecture was being shoved down my throat. Not once. I can't tell you how grateful I am for that.  It was about people doing their jobs, and I was formidably entertained. What a great mix of talent was brought to the equation, and they consistently hit the ball out of the park. Buy this season and the rest, because shows this full of quality only remind me that I don't think we're going to ever see writing this good again, in our age of Dumbed-Down Everything.",1413676800,,6081,4.847930702598653

Of course, it would not be the ""Closer"" if it didn't throw in some grand surprises, like in ""Last RItes"" where Brenda's mother dies (not the father as one may have expected) and finally getting the ""Last Word"" in the last episode in capturing her old nemesis Mark Stroh.  Chief Brenda Johnson is truly ""one of a kind"" in her demeanor which truly masks the highly intelligent person she is.  What held my attention throughout the entire series was the ability of the show's creators to continue to creatively intertwine Chief Brend Johnson's work persona with her home life which sometimes became blurred for she was truly never ""off the job"" which many times work to her aiblity to ""close"" her cases as well as to the detriment of her inability to do the same for home and family.  Chief Brend Johnson would truly be a study in motion for professionals in the area of psychology.

There is a great plot twist in one of the last episodes of The Closer that will have you reeling.

4475694,4,B004UXVDJA,Love the show,1404950400,,13,3.6666666666666665
4475695,5,B004UXVDJA,"This was one of the great show.
I really got into Brenda Leigh Johnson's character.
She seemed so real and outrageously fine which I couldn't let her go.",1404950400,,153,4.5
4475696,5,B004UXVDJA,"For likeminded viewers who appreciate police procedurals written for thinking adults, this series is for you. For a long time I avoided The Closer thinking it would be too fluffy and irritating (especially after binge-watching The Shield which I LOVED.) However when I finally submitted to the first season, I quickly became hooked. I was engrossed with the storylines, characters, the interdepartmental politics and of course the sprinkling of humor throughout. By the seventh and final season, I could fully relate to Brendas difficulties with losing some family yet still remaining committed to her partner, her colleagues, and her work. Kyra Sedgwick is a fantastic actress and is gifted with a hugely talented  ensemble cast, wonderful writers, and great production values. This is an adult show that hits every mark  I highly recommend.",1404950400,,842,5.323308270676692
4475697,5,B004UXVDJA,This was my favorite season.  I've enjoyed the characters humor and growth throughout the series. If you like crime/murder mysteries with a bit of humor and back story you will like this series too.,1404864000,,198,4.823529411764706
4475698,5,B004UXVDJA,The Closer was one of the best shows in my opinion.  Kyra Sedgwick played the role of Brenda Lee so well that it's difficult to picture her without the accent.  Have purchased all seven DVDs and have watched them more than once.,1404864000,,228,4.404761904761905

4475705,5,B004UXVDJA,Its not just a cop show it how the group of people become more like family. They work well together and they have the compassion for one another. The crimes range huriffic to out right stupid reasons why people commit murder. You never really know what's going to happen. Then they through other crimes or agencies into the mix so there's always something going on. So nice you can pause it and avoid commercials so you never miss anything.,1404432000,,440,4.582278481012659

4475709,4,B004UXVDJA,"I really enjoyed watching season 7 (the last season). One thing I liked about the show and the writing was the weaving of multiple stories into each episode. For example, the dynamics between the characters and the deepening of the interpersonal relationships. In contrast between the Closer, and the new spinoff (Major Crimes), only has an average of two threads, the specific plot of the episode as well as the ongoing evolution of Rusty and his situation.",1404172800,,458,4.961038961038961
4475710,5,B004UXVDJA,This show has been great from the first season to this last season.  I think the ending was awesome and stayed true to the entire show.  Definitely a must buy!,1404000000,,159,4.266666666666667
4475711,5,B004UXVDJA,This was great because they kept the MF-er down - did not need to use all the bad language to have my attention.,1404000000,,112,3.9130434782608696

4475736,4,B004UXVDJA,The seasons were great. It seems the content was the same as the last show. Needs a little more fling every now and then. Was a little boring.,1403740800,,142,4.107142857142857
4475737,5,B004UXVDJA,Always a great series.  Brenda Lee Johnson uses feminine guile to solve Los Angeles major crimes while she struggles to control her errant older detectives and remain married... Always a good mix of crime and humor.,1403568000,,215,4.972222222222222
4475738,3,B004UXVDJA,Kyra Sedgwick plays a character with few endearing qualities.  The stories start off well and the initial draw for me was the innovative ways that Brenda Lee obtained confessions. These instances appeared less and less as the show progressed.  There were many obvious attempts to get the viewer to like the main character by putting her in emotional situations where she had to cry.  I wonder if this is because Kyra made the character so unlikable.  This season felt rushed.  Situations that took several episodes to set up were often resolved in minutes.,1403568000,2,556,4.935483870967742
4475739,5,B004UXVDJA,I have enjoyed watching this show with all the great story-lines & characters! Looking forward to the series spin-off Major Crimes.,1403568000,,131,5.285714285714286
4475740,5,B004UXVDJA,"One of the absolute best shows I have seen in a long time.  The last 3 episodes of the series had me in tears.  But the way the producers ended this show was done really well.  A lot of other series should take note from this one on how to end a series (like the producers of Glades).  I hope that maybe in the next year or so, Kyra Sedgwick is back on TV.  Maybe in the roll of the job she was taking at the end?  I certainly hope so.  I think that would make for a very good spin off of The Closer.  Tying the 2 together would be like icing on the cake.

The cast on this show are absolutely wonderful to watch.  They are work so seamlessly together like so few others ever have.  As for the writers they know how to keep the story moving forward and how to end it.

If your looking for a good show to watch then pick this one.",1403568000,,829,3.8402366863905324
4475741,4,B004UXVDJA,"It's not often that one runs into a television series that is on the air for seven years and the scripts remain fresh and the characters continue to develop.  I am not a TV watcher - I don't own one by choice.

This series kept me riveted to my kindle Fire HDX (which I also highly recommend) for quite a while.  Yes, I do plan to watch some or all of the episodes at some later date.

Do yourself a favor.  Watch episodes one and two and you'll see.  Good acting.",1403308800,,464,4.043956043956044

4475775,5,B004UXVDJA,"Good price and arrived within a week.
Never watched when The Closer was on TV, but watched the seasons 1- using my library.
They did not have season 7 and had to know what happened to Major Crimes.
Enjoyed it very much.",1403049600,,219,4.238095238095238

4475803,5,B004UXVDJA,"When Kyra Sedgwick announced she was leaving The Closer, writers must have been given full reign. The final season did not disappoint. Plus, a new story line was created which resulted in a spinoff program, Major Crimes. With Mary McConnell taking over major crimes due to Brenda Leigh Johnson's (Sedgwick) departure, I was doubtful the super soft spoken Sharon Raydor would keep fans coming back. Boy was I wrong! They just premiered season 3!",1402704000,,444,5.013513513513513

4475806,5,B004UXVDJA,"Recently, I re-watched every episode of ""The Closer"" from the very first episode to the last. I loved getting to know the characters and their individual personalities.  The writers are masters at making a mish-mosh of personalities coalesce into a top-notch team of law enforcement folks. The quality of the program is outstanding from sets to locations to individuals. If you can put up with Brenda Leigh Johnson's  ayakksent you'll learn to appreciate her abilities as an analytical and dogged detective. Even the characters that irritate us (Brenda's dad, for example) add to the color and tone of the show. If the sight of blood doesn't repel you, you'll love The Closer.",1402617600,,676,5.026785714285714

When Judy passed  I inherited her 3 pets:  2 huge dogs and a 7 month old kitten.  The pups are a 118 lb Rotweiller, 72 lb shepherd mix and the 7 month old bottle fed kitten who Judy the Great rescued after it was abandoned on her property had no name, just like Brenda never really named ""Kitty"".  Larry is now almost 3 yrs old and she's a rowdy little type A.  I gave Larry a boy's name even though she's a girl, in honor of Brenda.

I'm not sure if the ending of this series was planned ahead or ended abruptly but there were times when I felt the end was being rushed and found myself wanting more but no more to watch unfortunately. Would like to see an Amazon recommended list of dramatic series similar to this for those of us who enjoy ongoing drama series without all the violence and language of today.

4476072,5,B004UXVDJA,"The characters in this series are very human and fun to watch, the sub-plots / stories are what really keep me coming back... not the crime solved in each episode. I also appreciate that violence is not a priority in the series. I can watch this in the evening and then sleep without reliving it in dreams. Relaxing and interesting, instead of scary.

4476077,4,B004UXVDJA,"I came across this show by accident, and it became a guilty pleasure for occasional binge viewing via Amazon Prime and Roku.  The characters are borderline cartoonish at times, but that's part of the fun for me.  It's no Law & Order, but that's fine.  This final season is, as much as anything, a set-up for a major shake-up in the cast and a retitling to Major Crimes.  That story arc actually makes this season a little less enjoyable since it takes on a more sad tone for the lead character, Brenda.  At the same time, it actually delivers a message about fairness in the judicial system and individuals' rights to fair trials and such.  While that is a good thing, it sort of takes away from the nature of the show.",1395360000,,719,4.409090909090909
4476078,5,B004UXVDJA,"Good entertainment for anyone who likes their heroine to be relentless and dedicated to the business of bringing those ""bad guys and gals"" to justice.  Her cronies are undoubtedly helpful in their pursuit of the facts which enable her to zero in on her prey; however, their occasional off the cuff entanglements are amusing and enjoyable.

4476081,5,B004UXVDJA,The Closer is an example of how good cable TV series are when compared to broadcast network series. It's addictive and the follow up series Major Crimes with many of The Closer characters is just as good if not better.,1395014400,,218,4.475

I've purchased each season and have rewatched each prior to viewing the new purchase (so I believe I've seen Season 1 about 5 times total). The last episode was so perfectly written and I appreciated the nod to the phrase Dpt. Chief Johnson uttered in her very first episode. I'm sad the series ended but I have all seven episodes to review for years to come.,1394928000,,430,4.3875

4476089,5,B004UXVDJA,I am sorry to say that the Closer finished this season with it's last episode. I will miss this program. It is my favorite series on television and it will take a lot to come up with something as good and captivating. There will never be another Brenda Johnson. Kyra played her part so well. I credit her with the overall success of the series.,1394755200,,344,4.3076923076923075

4476091,5,B004UXVDJA,"I love this show. There, I said it. I'm bummed that it is over--even more sad that I never saw one episode while it was in production. Kyra Sedgwick is truly fantastic as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson. The entire cast was exceptional, for that matter. The characterizations were really, really well done--both by the writers and by the actors. Each one was multi-dimensional...multi-faceted--no cardboard cutout characters here. A few of the episodes were slightly corny (the cross-country trek from Atlanta to LA in a motor-home is one example), but even the corny ones were worth watching. When I finished the entire series, from season 1 to season 7, I started all over again. It is really a show worth watching...and watching more than once. There isn't now nor has there ever been a show like it, with the depth of dynamics, humor, gross-out and action. I have yet to watch ""Major Crimes"" which was a spin-off from this show.

If you're wondering if The Closer is worth watching, the answer is... yes!",1394755200,,1010,4.838150289017341

4476114,3,B004UXVDJA,"What I take away from this series - and I acknowledge it's just fiction - are two simple observations of what the message of this show is.
First, if you want to be a world-class liar, just watch Kira deliver a master class. Second, never trust anything any police person ever says; they all want to be chief liar. Thank you; thank you very much - why I just LOVED this series, I did, i assure you; thank you - thank you very much...ring ding, anyone?",1394668800,,450,4.244186046511628
4476115,5,B004UXVDJA,"The quality of the Closer series is unmatched in its genre in the contemporary marketplace. It stands alone. But for sheer entertainment value, in my opinion, I'd put it on a list with some other movies and videos I also have enjoyed that seemed to me superbly written, directed, acted, and filmed. On that list would be at least Winds of War, Foyle's War, Monk, the Sarah Conner Chronicles, and Upstairs Downstairs. Just engaging creations of fiction, all of which I accessed through newly available archival streaming services, and otherwise would have missed. The portrayal of Chief Johnson's flawed personality was more believable, and, I think, closer to the real world than the similar excellent effort in the movie, ""As Good As It Gets"", and better all around than Monk.",1394582400,,777,4.984615384615385

My favorite cases were all the ones that she was sued for. Thats the kind of creative resolution I liked to see. I love Flynn and Provenza. I enjoy the relationship they have and how it relates to the squad. My favorite is Sanchez.

When it came to Amazon Prime and I was sick one weekend I decided to give it another chance and I am sure glad I did. I love all of the characters and I loved seeing them change through the years. They are now doing Major Crimes but Kyra is gone. I wish she would come back but it won't be the same I guess because the actor who played her husband has his own TNT show now.,1391472000,,467,3.7755102040816326

4476334,5,B004UXVDJA,"Loved the show and hated to see it end. great combination of drama and some comedy.

4476363,5,B004UXVDJA,"As always, the drama is great, the personalities entertaining
and the subtle sub-threads through the plot and from episode to
episode (often involving Flynn and Provenza) are like great spices on a steak.
The entire cast of characters continue their great work.  The writers have
done a wonderful job of developing each character and season seven
continues to reveal the depth of each character.  The creativity in all
aspects of the show continues in this season.  The attention to detail
is awesome.  The drama is sometimes gut wrenching and the humor
will have you laughing out loud.  I think this is the best show on TV,
perhaps ever.

Kyra Sedgwick continues to amaze in her role as Chief Johnson.
Watch some of the blooper scenes and notice how completely Kyra
becomes Brenda Lee in every way - accent, expression, attitude, posture,
body language, eyes, movement.  When she turns the ""Brenda Lee"" switch off the
transformation is stunning and exposes her great acting.
Perhaps had Kyra put her acting career ahead of motherhood, she
might have gained recognition as one of the best female actresses ever.
I salute her choice, and am glad we have been treated to her talent
in her role on this amazing show.",1390176000,,1213,4.859223300970874

4476369,5,B004UXVDJA,Watched all seven seasons over the last four months.  Another series I fell in love with.  Kera was amazing.  Now hooked on Major Crimes.,1389916800,,137,4.625
4476370,5,B004UXVDJA,"To bad this show had to end, Breanda was the best, she way tough yet had a way about her that let you know she cared, loved the show was sorry to see it end.",1389830400,,157,3.5142857142857142
4476381,5,B004UXVDJA,"Nothing has changed from my previous review of The Closer: Great writing, direction, production values support excellent acting. But what really underscores it all, is the music. Rarely does the music interfere with the story, yet it moves with the dramatic and comedic action subtly the way herbs and spices enhance a meal. Nothing spoils a great bit of writing and acting more than an overbearing score; just as laughter tracks blunt a comedy. The Closer - listen to the music, enjoy the main course of superb television.",1389830400,,523,4.954545454545454
4476382,5,B004UXVDJA,"My only regret is there will be no more episodes of The Closer. I will truly miss this show, even though the show is moving on in a very close spin off, Major Crimes. I have been watching Major Crimes and have enjoyed it very much but no one or nothing will replace Brenda Lee Johnson (Kyra Segwick) as the show's star. I can only hope Brenda Lee will be on Major Crimes as a guest star in the future.",1389830400,,401,4.025
4476383,5,B004UXVDJA,A terrific conclusion to a wonderful series. I love the characters as they developed in this show. It is a little sad to leave a few behind (although most are carried on to Major Crimes). Only criticism - the last several episodes seemed a little bit hurried to tie up all the loose ends that they had created through previous seasons/episodes.,1389830400,,344,4.655737704918033
4476384,5,B004UXVDJA,Loved this series from the begining and the final one did not dissappoint.  It wrapped it out nicely on the last episode and connected smoothly to the Major Crimes spin off.,1389830400,,173,4.580645161290323
4476385,5,B004UXVDJA,"Love this show for a bunch of reasons, but I think the best part is the character cast.  Great combination of plots, seriousness and comedic interludes.",1389830400,,152,4.846153846153846

4476388,5,B004UXVDJA,I bought this DVD set for my daughter who is a huge fan of the show and she thoroughly enjoyed it! She was sad to see the series come to an end but found this season to be just as well-done as the first. The gift was a big hit and didn't disappoint.,1389744000,,249,3.7169811320754715

4476390,5,B004UXVDJA,"I missed the finale because my boyfriend wanted to watch some stupid show, and I figured I could watch it On Demand. NOT. They never showed it due to sells of the boxed sets. I've waited almost two years and wasn't disappointed. Thanks Amazon.",1389657600,,243,4.545454545454546
4476411,5,B004UXVDJA,"I have the 7th Season on Prime Amazon and I have been fortunate to watch it through now twice.  Last year I only watched the show once (+) on my DVR and then deleted it.  Geeesh ! ! ! If I had to hear about the Shooten' Newton Murders AGAIN I thought I was going to scream.  However, this time on Prime with no commercials :) I seemed to tolerate the Shooten' Newton phrase over and over again, better.  I really ENJOYED Brenda's lawyer Gavin Baker (Mark Pellegrino) ! ! !  He was funny and very entertaining.  I really felt that The Closer had lost its humor as the show moved into its 5th-6th Season.  It was great having the eccentric, very-expensive lawyer around to FUN things up.  The arguments between Brenda and Will Pope (J. K. Simmons) got tiresome.  Initially, I had to bite through Captain Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell) in seasons 5 &  6 but I must say re-watching Season 7 was my breakthrough to really enjoy her role.  It took me a while to warm up to her but what can I say, I would not let anything interfere with watching Brenda and the Gang.  Finally, we got the Shooten Newton legal crap done with and low-and-behold we have yet another legal mess.  Regardless, I made it through the 7th season and enjoyed it tremendously.  Then I had to come to terms with ""Major Crimes"" - The writers did a masterful piece of work weaving Rusty Beck (Graham Patrick Martin) into the Sharon Rader character.  I have always loved Lieutenant Provenza, I believe his character sealed the bond between ""The Closer"" and ""Major Crimes.""  I continue to love Brenda Leigh Johnson and ""The Closer"" and I am really appreciating ""Major Crimes.""  Blue-Chip TV all the way !",1389571200,,1666,4.5
4476412,5,B004UXVDJA,The seventh season of the closer was the best out of all the seasons......The show ended with a bang. I would recommend it to all my friends.,1389571200,,141,4.2592592592592595

Brilliantly written material filled with humor, strong characters, drama, serious issues acted by a very talented ensemble cast and starring the amazing Kyra Sedwick.  Each episode focuses on a crime but from episode to episode how the crime is solved nevers quite plays out the same way.

I loved all of the seasons, but the 7th one hit the heart more, especially with Willy Rae's death, and loved that they finally got rid of Stroh and of course Prflynnza is always fabulous when they find a body after doing something stupid.  Was great to meet more of the other families and friends too.  Great job with David Gabriel's storyline.  And the guest stars were amazing this season.

4476583,5,B004UXVDJA,I love Kara Sedgwick. She has so much personality. I LOVE TO WATCH OUR her mind works in solving the crime and then her knack at getting confessions.  It's not just another crime drama. It seems a bit lighter and that why I love the show so much. There is always had a nice switch in every show. I have watched the entire series every show about 10 times. Love it,1385078400,,363,4.112676056338028
4476584,5,B004UXVDJA,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.
 So far Ive bought DVDs of forty shows. Ive found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.
The best recent show, in my opinion, was The Closer. Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Lee Johnson was one of only three regular female cast members, but she more than held up her end, often in contention with numerous strong male characters, especially those played by Tony Denison, G.W.Bailey and Jon Tenney.
The story lines were the best of any police show Ive ever seen. The acting of everyone was first-rate. Even the subplots were sustained above the level of commonplace melodrama.
If there was anything wrong with this show at all, it was a half-dozen episodes at the end of season seven, in which Sedgwicks endearing character was confronted with a series of emotion-crushing incidents.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners. This list features at least one show from every era of TV.",1384905600,,1657,4.713793103448276
4476585,5,B004UXVDJA,"My all-time favorite series for a number of reasons, the characters are well-rounded and very, very human.  I love the variety of shows from the truly heart-wrenching to laugh out loud funny (Flynn and Provenza) and I really like the marriage of Brenda and Fritz, it's nice to see marriage portrayed positively.  I liked the fact there was closure to the Stroh storyline and I loved the fact that Brenda, who basically has no ability to be introspective, finally began to see herself more clearly.  Every character in this show made you want to know more about them, I enjoyed the glimpse into Lt. Tao's personal life and the scenes with his son, I loved seeing Flynn's tender side when the young girl was killed by the hit and run driver and I was so touched by Sanchez' desire to protect Brenda.  I'm going to miss Brenda Leigh but am so glad these characters will continue in Major Crimes and I hope that show will reveal even more about them.",1384819200,,946,4.547058823529412
4476586,5,B004UXVDJA,"In previous seasons, Brenda Leigh has made some choices out of frustration with her boss and frustration with the system that
were questionable at best.  Her cavalier attitude about doling out her own justice comes back to haunt her and a civil suit makes her question her judgments, her actions and her mindset.  Family losses, Leadership changes and contact with an abandoned boy who is witness in a crucial case make her look at herself in a different light. She may not see herself as clearly as Fritzi does, but she does see more of her shortcomings and makes a decision to take herself out of the environment which has enabled these poor decisions.",1384819200,,654,4.728070175438597

But I do enjoy my Amazon Prime, and on the recommendation of a friend, I gave this series a chance. What a surprise! Did I like every single episode? No. But only a few out of SEVEN seasons? ""Brenda"" fascinated me. I watched all seven seasons in three weeks. I'd relax with two or three episodes after a long day. And now that it's over...I actually feel sad. I miss them, I really do. The writing was top notch and the acting superb. I didn't like how corn pone the show got when her parents showed up, and that Fritz must have the least challenging FBI job imaginable...but those were the weaknesses. The strengths far outweighed any of the weaker story points or (few) episodes. I felt like I knew those characters and I could have just kept on watching. Fine job to ALL involved. Turns out to be one of my favorite series ever.",1381622400,,944,4.279329608938547
4476660,5,B004UXVDJA,"I truly hate that this series ended , it had one of the strongest female characters, ever.  She was attractive and professional, also very capable when dealing with the ""good ole boys"" network.  She new how to handle herself physically with some of the strongest and most violent adversaries.  She didn't have to become a ""victim"" as so many female characters in modern media seems to demand of these characters.
That the be ""victimized"" first and then are strong, ""Brenda Lee Johnson"" was a very qualified negotiator and held her own with the best of them and didn't back down from unpopular decisions.  She had very decisive ideas about right and wrong and not something the industry allows female characters to have.  Males usually are the one that can make the hard decisions and stand by them and this character in ""The Closer"" was very good at.  I wish the industry wrote more strong female characters like this, but they usually make females if they arfe good, victims of crimes and then they over come it, or if they are strong and prevent themselves from becoming ""victims"" they are psychotic/crazy female killers or something like that.
The show had character and great individual character development of the whole squad, each contributed to a complete and profoundly interesting and well written show.",1381536000,,1313,4.918552036199095

I have watched all seven seasons; guess I'll have to go back to season one and start over.  Bettye",1379894400,,457,5.053333333333334
4476689,5,B004UXVDJA,"One of the things that struck me most about this series was how human and believable the characters were.  Everyone had their flaws.  No one was a superhero.  Another was Brenda Johnson's character played by Kyra Sedgewick.  She was highly confident, effective, yet vulnerable.  Her sense of justice was flawed by a disposition toward the ends justifying the means.  In many of the episodes the point is made that her thinking parallels that of her suspect. Also while this series had episodes heavy in drama, it also offered occasional diversions into very effective and entertaining comedy.  Start with season one and run it all the way through.  You will love all seven seasons of this series!",1379894400,,696,4.939655172413793

4476736,4,B004UXVDJA,"The seventh season is the last season with Kyra Sedgewick - so there was a log of ""non crime"" storylines thrown into the mix.

It's still a very good show, but this season saw ""Chief Johnson"" gonig through much more angst and stress.  She's subject of a long story ark involving a lawsuit against her; which I think ran too long.  She also has many more interpersonal struggles and run ins involving Chief Pope and her family.

So, it's still a very solid show, and I strongly recommend the series: but this season seemed bogged-down in much of the personal drama.  Seasons 1 & 2, I think, were the best.",1379030400,,604,4.454545454545454

4476778,4,B004UXVDJA,I felt this episode was finishing up the season overall the show was great.  It seemed like they tried to pack the ending to the show into the last two or three shows of the season.  I feel they should have made the ending start a couple of shows out.,1378339200,,251,4.0

4476797,4,B004UXVDJA,"By the time the Sixth Season ended, it was clear that the series was circling the drain.  I was sorry to see it go.  The Seventh Season had a lot of loose ends to tie up, some of which were well tied and some of which were not, and there was an abundance of program cliches brought in to stretch the emotional level out until the very end.  It's nuts that the series has Brenda saying ""looks like love"" as her last line in the series when those were her opening lines in Episode 1, Season 1.  The lines didn't work in 1/1 and they do not work in 7/21.  It's nuts that Sgt. Gabriel's girlfriend is the leak (I so wanted it to be Cmdr Taylor, but I guess he had a contract for Major Crimes and they had to find somebody else to hang it on)  But we ride our favorites until the end, and this series is no exception.  Watch it, enjoy it, say goodbye to it, watch Captain Raydor take over an energized Major Crimes unit, watch Fritz go off to his own disappointing afterlife,  watch Brenda try to fake an orgasmic appreciation of another foil-wrapped chocolate cake -- it's sad. It was like watching the last season of West Wing, or the last episodes of Seinfeld or the last episodes of The Sopranos.",1377734400,,1195,4.2105263157894735

4477013,5,B004UXVDJA,"The Closer introduces Kira Sedgewick as the new head of the Major Crimes Division.

The group of almost all male detectives put her through the paces, but she pushes back in gentle ways, always using her southern charm to calm a situation. The men learn to respect her as they watch her in action -- closing the deal, so to speak. Brenda gets perps to confess by expertly sidling up to them with that southern charm, disarming them. Then, like the snap of a southern gator, she latches onto the lie, the statement that doesn't match, or the arrogance of the criminal and twists them in a verbal death roll taking them down and closing the case.

This is an excellent crime drama with a heart -- and a bite! Watch this, and you'll be hooked!!",1374451200,,741,4.4411764705882355

 I will certainly miss the show!",1374364800,,127,4.7727272727272725
4477016,5,B004UXVDJA,"The closer in 1080p HD is a very interesting experience as the acting has to overcome the video format and it does.  Things often look too real, too cheap, too staged, with lighting glaringly obvious and makeup obviously painted on.  Despite all of that Kyra Sedgewick  convinces you of the character she is presenting as does the marvelous supporting cast.  She will never have a better role in her life and she should return and take Major Crimes (series sequel) back.  Things can get a little corny from time to time but when you want to begin and end a series with the same script line, you have to concede this is art and not life.  It looks like love.",1374364800,,657,4.433333333333334

I hate that this is the last season, but it was a smart move to not let a good thing go on until it was no longer a good thing.  I should know better than to read reviews as someone has pretty much given away the last episode and they should really give a spoiler alert but I still look forward to how it all wraps up.  The Closer is hands down one of my favorite TV series ever!",1374019200,,512,3.941747572815534

Needless  to say I made up for lost time, hooked from the first couple episodes I proceeded  to watch one episode after another in very short order.

The stories are very well written, with just the right amount of drama, tension and intrigue between the characters.

My only negative comment I have about the series is that it is now over. Although I will be watching the spin off  series ""Major Crimes"" it just won't be the same without Kyra Sedgwick's quirky character ""Brenda Leigh Johnson"".",1371772800,,664,4.5

4477140,5,B004UXVDJA,"I loved ""The Closer"" series and am sad to see it go. I was happy to see if available on Amazon and wanted to give Prime a try so I thought I'd check in with the 'Free' 30 day Trial that came with my Vizio TV. While it wasn't too hard to find ""The Closer"" while searching on the website using the app on the smart tv was something else. I had to scroll through 20 to 30 pages before I finally found what I was looking for and if I hadn't already known it was there I definitely would not have bothered to keep tabbing through pages after page. They really need some sort of filter or search mechanism on the Amazon Video app at least for VIA don't know if there is a different one for other 'Smart TV' platforms.
Once I found the series it ran well and if I didn't have to leave the application it kept my place to go from one episode to the next perhaps not as smoothly as some of the other vendors but OK. Once you logged out though, you had to do the search again.",1370736000,,966,3.958974358974359

4477144,5,B004UXVDJA,I loved this show from the very beginning and was sad to see it end. They had great writers for the show and I was never disappointed by any episode. Truly a great show. Lots of drama and suspense with the occasional comedy thrown in. Definitely worth watching.,1370563200,,261,4.458333333333333
4477145,5,B004UXVDJA,"Watching the last season of ""The Closer"" made me wonder why it was - the last season! The writing and acting is excellent. The stories are engaging. The people are human. The writers manage to keep the viewer informed of the personal foibles of the characters and their private lives without those private lives taking over the show, as has been the case in many other programs, particularly those involving law enforcement themes. I am truly sorry this show is off the air.",1370476800,,474,4.72289156626506
4477146,5,B004UXVDJA,"Funny, engaging and suspenseful. A great cast and a thrilling narrative arc each season. One of my faves. Kyra absolutely shines as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.",1370476800,,166,5.185185185185185

4477168,5,B004UXVDJA,"This was a bittersweet viewing, knowing from the start that it would be the end.  Also since I'd cut off cable and had not seen any of these episodes I had no idea what to expect and it was fresh viewing all the way...what a great ride...sorry it had to end. They gave Brenda a proper closing but I don't want to say more or it would be a spoiler.",1370390400,,347,3.9571428571428573
4477169,5,B004UXVDJA,"One of the best police drama shows, second only in my opinion to Law and Order. Well developed plots, characters and good writing. It's refreshing to have a police drama feature a strong female lead.

4477170,5,B004UXVDJA,My wife and i watched all the seasons in only a few weeks.  We were very disappointed when there were no more episodes.  This is a brilliantly written show with characters who you become genuinely interested in.  I would say this show was addicting and i am very sad Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is no longer with the LAPD! (or was this just a TV show?:),1370390400,,359,4.3283582089552235

4477197,5,B004UXVDJA,Lots of shows just go through what worked for the previous seasons. In this season the writers dealt with a serious issue of  Brenda's sense of justice vs her commitment to the law. Throughout the previous seasons the line has blurred on several cases. We all applauded her acting in this manner while ignoring the consequences. This season dealt with it.,1369526400,,355,4.819672131147541
4477208,5,B004UXVDJA,"I have been a Closer fan since the first season.  I have enjoy it's different approach to crime solving.  I missed the last season and was thrilled so see it come to Prime.  I sat one rainy, nasty eastern day and watched the whole seventh season.  I was not disappointed.  The series ended exactly as I would wanted.  If you have not had the opportunity to see the entire series, be sure to do so.  Kyra Sedgwick won Emmys for her performance and deserved every one.  I am only sad that it ended.  If I can find time I will watch all the seasons from the beginning again.",1369440000,,571,4.212962962962963

4477216,5,B004UXVDJA,"I am not and have never been a TV watcher and could never understand how anyone could become so involved with a series that they actually looked forward to the next episode.  The story line, the connection between the cast, the sincerity of actors in their roles (especially Kyra) made me fully understand what could be considered an addiction to a show.  I had never seen any Closer episodes until I started from the pilot and then the first season on my Kindle fire. Then almost every evening as I continued to read my selected novels I followed reading by what I considered desert..........the entire series, one show at a time and each year in order.",1369094400,,654,4.629310344827586

4477219,4,B004UXVDJA,"The plot lines and scripts were just as bizarre and humorous as previous years. Almost every 'loose end' was tied up by resolving the 'criminal liability suit', Brenda's parent's health and the 'future' of the Major Crimes Division unit. This season was a fitting wrap for the series. Hopefully, Major Crimes will continue to have the same quality of scripts and bizarre plot lines.",1368835200,,382,4.984375
4477220,5,B004UXVDJA,I have enjoyed this series from Day One and highly recommend it to anyone who likes great crime drama with a twist at the end. I am glad that Major Crimes will spin off from this and continue the fine stories with a new female lead.,1368748800,,232,4.065217391304348

4477226,5,B004UXVDJA,"If The Closer was a book, it would be considered a page-turner. Non-stop action. You never know what's going to happen next. Now that I've finished watching Season 7 I'm starting over with Season 1. Thanx Amazon.",1368576000,,212,4.756756756756757

4477241,5,B004UXVDJA,"I liked being able to see it on Prime because the episodes were a little disjointed when it was broadcast. Engaging stories. May not stand the light of day on reflection, but riveting while being displayed. I was curious how Brenda would be written out of the script.",1368489600,,267,4.583333333333333

4477243,5,B004UXVDJA,Love the show with a touch of humor and good investigative work.  actors played their parts very well although some got a bit childish...but that's probably the writers.,1368489600,,169,5.035714285714286
4477244,5,B004UXVDJA,You know how the final season of some shows sort of limps along to the foregone conclusion that you saw coming a mile away?  This is not one of those seasons.  It just whips along with twists and turns all over the place.  The tension is high in Major Crimes division with loyalty put to the test.  After the final episode i felt like I could finally breathe again...like I'd been holding my breath during the whole season.,1368403200,,423,4.384615384615385

4477246,5,B004UXVDJA,"Brenda moves on. The plot of the last program is reasonable, and still surprising. The series managed to vary its themes, though Brenda's techniques are predictable, ultimately. ""Themes"" are issues of the times. And occasionally a program will offer a humorous treatment of an issue.
Squabbles over whose case it is, FBI's or Brenda's group's or someone else's, are predictable by the end.",1368230400,,389,5.190476190476191

Season 7 has been running around $40, almost half the price of the Prime membership. The episode writing was amazing as always.  All of the main characters have had story lines in  this season that emphasized the strengths and talents of each actor. Hated to see this show end. This is one show that I have watched the reruns several times. If all seasons stay on Amazon Prime, I will have no problem renewing my membership again.

4477256,5,B004UXVDJA,"The characters were all very engaging.  I enjoyed seeing them evolve from first to last episode.  Brenda was a wonderful role model for women: strong, decisive, not easily intimidated, and without a loss of her feminity. But she was not perfect.  Her mistakes were humanizing, and thought provoking.  The events leading to the realization of how her job was changing who she was and her decision to choose a different path led to a very satisfying series conclusion.  Fritz, I am in love with you.  You're my kind of man!.  And Willie Rae, so wise and so dear.  I loved all of the characters.  They became a part of my life.",1367625600,,624,4.54954954954955

But, the part that really made it to far fetch for me was how Brenda manage to continue her way of doing things even after the number of lawsuits. In the real world she would have been given a thankless job until the lawsuits have been resolved or terminated from her position. No police department in this country would have alowed her to continue and that's where you lost my intterrest, but IF guess thhat Hollywood.",1366848000,,539,4.454545454545454

There were some shockers in there, and I won't mention them now.  Too many spoilers for those of you who want to watch it for yourselves.  This series shows both sides of the criminal process.  Sometimes you can't help but be on the criminals side and other times, the side of law enforcement.  But it makes for a great show and it definitely gets you thinking!

Now he's watching Season Seven. This is a superior show, with a dynamic and very entertaining cast that work very well together. Kyra Sedgewick is an outstanding actress in this series. This is a must see for those that  I haven't either caught up with the last season or have never seen the show. Although, if you have never seen the show, I recommend that you get the earlier seasons to be able to see  how ""Brenda Leigh Johnson and her unit of police officers develop into an excellent team who develop a close and endearing bond with  wonderful humor and great drama."" This is my all-time favorite show and sure to become a classic.",1366761600,,800,4.355704697986577

4477293,5,B004UXVDJA,I appreciated how they ended a beloved show.  It tied up some loose ends and gave insight into how that character moves forward,1366675200,,127,4.521739130434782
4477294,5,B004UXVDJA,I don't have a cable provider so watched this show on line for a few years until TNT entered into an agreement with the cable providers requiring people to have a code to access their online content.

4477296,5,B004UXVDJA,"""The Closer"" is captivating, personal, and humorous. This final season ties up several loose ends in the lives of Brenda Leigh Johnson and her Major Crimes unit. Be prepared to be lifted and dashed until the last scene! The conclusion leaves the door wide open for future programming options.

Be prepared also for the show's continued menu of sexual suggestions and colorful language. What a change it would be to watch an action-packed, genuine drama offering believable characters, plots, and resolutions minus the vulgarity!",1366329600,,528,5.285714285714286

Kira Segwick is the best. Her character is real and is an awesome example of a strong woman, but yet she is vulnerable.

4477348,5,B004UXVDJA,"This was one of my all time favorite shows. I absolutely loved Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick). She is a great actress and was amazing in this role.  She could draw you in and make you ride the emotional roller coaster law enforcement officers ride on a daily basis. The subject matter was always thought provoking and kept me anxious for the next week's episode. The other actors on the show were all very well cast....there seemed to be a great energy between them. If you rent this series, you will not be disappointed.",1364947200,,527,4.6063829787234045

4477359,5,B004UXVDJA,"then I fall in love with this TV series.
Actually is a bounch of ""outsiders"" some are ex addicted to booze. Chief of this squad is Brenda Lee, she is an outsider because is a simple girl from the South... so simple that she catch all the bad guys in L.A.!!!
She do not plays 100% in the rules and this cause her several problems...
Usually the episodes are 'fresh' despite the quantity of situations exploited during the 7 seasons, personally I do not like the xmas episodes when Brenda's parents are in L.A., do not get me wrong those are great actors but the story suffers of the factitious reasons to bring them and stay in L.A. annoying Fritzy and Brenda Lee.
Fritzy and Tao are the most smart and sexy agents of the bunch, Corey Reynolds is the less convincing character in my opinion, not because he is not a good actor (he sure is) but because of the role he plays.
Brenda Lee is always sexy and elegant (if we want to consider as ""elegant"" to show on a crime scene in high heels and a pink Chanel-like dress with a big black tote costing nothing less than $1,000 or more) the males excluding Fritzy are generally clothed as a bunch of dumbs.
Usual cameos by very good actors here and there.
Chief Pope the chief of L.A.P.D. (and with this name what else...) plays the part of the most idiotic policeman in the story of TV.
A last word on Mary McDonnell very much underused as a pain for Brenda Lee but then they are friend but then they are not... poor use of a very good actress.
A very last word on Provenza and Flinn 2 'losers' that you can't not love!",1364515200,,1563,4.265993265993266
4477360,5,B004UXVDJA,"As with the six prior seasons, the seventh and last season of the Closer was excellent. The episodes leading up to the final one were exciting and well acted.  The series ended with class as Kyra's character took another and equally important position in the LA law enforcement community.",1364515200,,288,4.877551020408164
4477361,5,B004UXVDJA,This show is fabulous. Kyra's witt is unmatched! She keeps people on their toes and thinking. She pushes the legal envelope to its limits.,1364428800,,138,4.791666666666667
4477362,5,B004UXVDJA,"I really like this show because I like the characters. I think the dynamics of the characters on the show are great and they have really good plot lines. There is also some humor so it's not always too dramatic. I really like Kyra Sedgwick and her character in the show. She is plays the character perfectly in that she'll leads suspects to believe she is a ""dumb blonde"" and then whips their butts intellectually. She uses her femininity to lead the criminals to confess without remorse, I love it! I also like the relationship she has with her FBI husband. Neither are perfect but are so accepting of each other, and when they work together on some cases it can be pretty funny because she is so competitive. It's a good show to check out.",1364428800,,741,4.455882352941177
4477363,5,B004UXVDJA,"The writing is fresh and original.  The actors are awesome, with one or two exceptions, and are ""relatable"".  Kyra S is remarkable as Brenda.  The character Brenda is very driven, perhaps even borderline crazy.  It takes a real actress to perform a role that convincingly.  Kudos also to the actors playin Provenza, Flynn, and Sanchez.  Without these guys, Sedgwick's performances would be out of balance.  Their performances lend credibility to her character.  A lesser supporting cast would render the scripts unbelieveable.",1364256000,,526,5.407407407407407

4477387,5,B004UXVDJA,"We really loved The Closer series staring Kyra Sedgwick as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson and consequently purchased the whole series through Season Seven with her in the staring role.  Her team stayed together throughout the seven seasons and gave us that intimate feeling of being part of her ""family,"" always anxious to see the next episode.  It was sad to see her moving on, but it felt right that she took with her Detective Sargent David Gabriel, who was always with her and showed a personal concern for her safety.  Her strong interaction with each of her team members showed her strength of character along with a softer side of compassion, leading to total allegiance from her whole team.  Meanwhile, her personal life with her endearing parents and her ever patient husband FBI Special Agent Fritz Howard showed a well-rounded person who won our hearts throughout the whole series.  It is always enjoyable to go back and revisit the series.",1363651200,,954,4.900621118012422

However, since I have all of the earlier seasons on DVD, I finally bought it.  Glad I did; the ending was better than I had expected although I was not happy that it was over.  A great series that I will probably be re-running on my DVD for years.  One of the extras included a round table type discussion with the cast: I found out why Kitty was taken off the show in an earlier season; (it was an event that seriously aggravated me at the time; her adoption in the earliest episdodes in Season 1 was one of the reasons I watched what I initially thought was a ditsy southern belle;) I would have been happier to not have found out why.",1363651200,,770,4.1824324324324325

I was unable to see all of the closing season, particularly the last few episodes and was able to catch up through Amazon Live Streaming.  I plan watching all 7 seasons again as it is one of those series you never tire viewing.  The acting and ensemble cast were outstanding and one of the best assembled, with each character adding to the story lines of each show.

Anyway, quality of CD's is flawless.  Each CD has a hefty number of shows, so if you want to watch it on a Saturday, one CD should do it and save the next CD for the following weekend, and so forth. It is just as good as on TV (of course), it is just nice to be able to put it on pause.  Make some popcorn and enjoy!",1363046400,,492,3.88

4477429,5,B004UXVDJA,"I'll admit that I've had this set of ""The Closer"" for a while and have yet to watch any episodes!  I LOVE this series, and I'm disappointed that it's over.  The characters and stories would draw me in each week.  I didn't get to watch any of the final season, since I gave up my cable--and the subsequent monthly bill.  And TNT, unlike other channels, doesn't make episodes available online unless you have cable; go figure.  Anyway, I guess I'll have to give in and have a weekend marathon.  I already know ""pieces"" from online ads and teasers on YouTube.  And it's great to have it available in a season set; I just wish it wasn't the *final* one!

The seventh and final takes the show out at a high point. Well worth the money - I look foward to watching them again.

Who doesn't want to be as strong as this woman and melt in someone's arms afterward,and still be credible?

As far as the 7th season DVD is concerned, I have to admit some disappointment.  Not in the shows themselves, but in the DVD.  The voices and images were slightly out of sync providing a constant annoyance.  But the biggest disappointment was the paucity of un-aired scenes.  I have enjoyed those and have found that watching them has enriched my enjoyment of the episodes and am sorry that there were so few in Season 7.

But the DVD includes a panel discussion by the cast, James Duff and other members of the creative staff.  This discussion is a must see for any fan of the series.  For me, it was worth the price of the DVD.",1358553600,,843,4.457516339869281

I was hoping that she wouldn't be killed off as a conclusion that so many series choose.  She had such talent in her area of crime closure.  Her team was super--loved how they dealt with her and her with them.  I needed to have closure.  The seventh season gave me that.  Bringing in more of Mary Mc Donnell was a home run.  Her character had evolved since it's
inception.  I am now following MAJOR CRIMES.  The characters are the same, but are given more latitude.  Mary M is a super

There were no commercials, so I feel I got my money's worth.  I was curious how many episodes would be on each disk and there were a lot, plus I it came with five disks, so I did get to see the entire season as I was able to fit them into my schedule.  The discs are numbered so you know in what order to see them.  The quality of the picture and video was flawless.  Since this was such a positive experience, I now feel comfortable buying more full season episodes of ""Major Crimes"" when released (the new title for the same show with one or two new characters).  I may not be able to wait for the full season because I love this show so much, I think I would like to buy each season immediately after they release it.

Some series phone it in during the final season. The Closer isn't one of those series and the last 3 episodes of Season 7 showcase just how talented and brilliant the actors and creative team behind the series truly are.

How the best acted, best written, best directed, best produced, highest rated basic cable drama series has never been nominated for Best Drama Series at either the Emmys or Golden Globes is shocking.

Kyra Sedgwick has rightfully won both the Emmy (Season 5 ""Maternal Instincts"") and Golben Globe (Season 2) Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her work as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, which has given her the role of a lifetime.

TNT should bring ""The Closer"" back as a limited series every two years for six episodes, as Brenda Leigh Johnson is truly missed.",1350518400,3,952,4.72289156626506

Flynn and Provenza serve papers for a lawyer to a man while Flynn photographs the occasion and Buzz videotapes it. As the older gents do a money dance at Buzz's car, Buzz notices that his rear tail light is busted and films it. Two seconds later, the man in question does a nose dive off his hotel balcony and lands on Buzz's hood. Forced to call the team (lead by Detective Gabriel) to the scene, Flynn and Provenza swear they do not know the man - until a snapshot of Provenza and the murder victim floats down from the hotel room. When FBI Agent Howard shows up to find out why a man scheduled to be sentenced in five days for swindling victims out of millions is dead on Buzz's car, the guys can no longer avoid telling Deputy Chief Johnson what happened. Once in the morgue, the coroner has a surprise for everyone - the man who was murdered was actor Scott Esposito - not corporate criminal Steven Hirschbaum. The search is on led by the FBI (and interfered with by Major Crimes) to find the soon to be jailbird and the murderer.

4477638,5,B004UXVDJA,"Each episode is amazing ~ in totally different ways.
This seventh & final season of The Closer contains 21 spell-binding episodes
and I appreciate the fact that this series doesn't focus on violence
as much as it does on the consequences of violence.

The Closer was produced with the new and original concept of focusing more
on the characters of the show then on the plot.
That concept brought a new dimension to viewers by drawing them in ~
in a more personal way of bonding with the characters,
which in turn resonates the consequences of crime.

The Closer is continually powerful in each episode of season seven,
With back-to-back dramatic and/or comedic pivoting moments that all pop in different ways
and has kept this crime drama series always fresh and original.
Each character has a powerful individual impact in the perfection of the show.

Written with careful authoritative detail of the exact procedures of how a crime squad actually works,
blended clarity and authenticity to this captivating series.
Often gems of information where passed along in an episode ~ such as
1. Eye movement & truth ~
If an individual looks up to their left (towards their left arm) their accessing the right part of their brain,
which is the memory side of his brain ~ so their accessing their memory.
So you can assume that to some degree what their saying is truthful.
If an individual looks up to their right (towards their right arm) their accessing the left side of their brain
which is the creative side.
So the theory is that they may be making things up.
Not always perfect, but often this theory holds true.
2. Megan's law web sight ~ type in your address & blue dots show where sex offenders live in your area.

To watch The Closer on DVD ~ with-out commercial interruptions has a totally different impact.
This is an ingenious and authoritative masterpiece!

The answer why Sedgwick left The Closer is easily found with a Web search.
But in a nut-shell Sedgwick says ~ ""I thought about it for about a year,
and it finally came down to the fact that I really want to do other things, creatively""

The writers had ample time to create the setting for Sedgwick to exit,
and start a spin-off titled ""Major Crimes,"" in which
Mary McDonnell is now at the helm as Capt. Sharon Raydor,
That show debuted on TNT immediately after the ""Closer"" finale.

Footnote: Kyra Sedgwick has three new motion pictures for release this year and next ~
""The Possession"" a horror film due out Aug 2012 ~~~ ""Kill Your Darlings"" and ""Chlorine"" .
Kevin Bacon ~ Kyra's husband of 24 yrs. is starring in his own police/FBI television thriller,
""The Following"" is to air on Fox channel early 2013.",1349740800,,2673,4.686567164179104

4477683,5,B004UXVDJA,"The final season of The Closer was so emotionally draining, that this episode stands out for its direction by Jon Tenney and the humorous story. Provenza and Flynn try and help Liz (Provenza's grammar correcting first wife) retrieve her wedding ring that sold for far below its worth to pay for Frank's medical bills. Frank is Liz's beloved bull dog who has more ailments than a senior citizen center. In the process of retrieving the ring from the gold buyer, the two cops unwittingly witness a robbery in progress. Frank eats the only evidence with fingerprints, and the search is on for a Bonnie and Clyde duo who have eluded cops for months. Tenney adds some wonderful touches - booties on Frank's feet like the detectives are wearing to investigate the crime scene, the co-owner of the shop who wants to go on TV to ask for his jewelry back, and Liz as the only one who can identify the bandits (vs. Flynn and Provenza who cannot.)

4477738,3,B004UXVDJA,"I just watched the last episode of the closer and I agree with the other reviewer, Brenda deserved better. Don't get me wrong, the episode was good and suspenful and I definetly enjoyed the end of the criminal who caused all the hard ache for the major crimes division but, it ended just like it started for brenda, with her trying to prove herself to people who can't hold a candle to her. When she got there pope was never really her friend and he stabbed her in the back to further his own career at every turn. I just don't like the fact that it worked, he became chief of police at brenda's expense. To recap again, taylor always thought brenda should never have been deputy chief and he did everything in his power to get rid of her. Again, it worked! He got her job and brenda is gone. It just seems like all she did to close cases that would never have been solved without her, the ending should have been better. I thought maybe since her mother died instead of her father, it would go off with her taking a job as chief of police in her home town to be closer to her father. Now that would have been a fit ending for Ms. Brenda Liegh Johnson. LOL. That would have let them know that she still won and that she was better than them. Oh well, it is for this reason that I will not be watching major crimes. To me they threw brenda to the wolves and the people who used her and never wanted her there get to gloat. Watching major crimes would be like a betrayal to Brenda! Thank you, thank you so much!",1346025600,4,1509,4.15358361774744
4477739,2,B004UXVDJA,"I've been waiting to write my review of the series finale to make sure what I say is not some backlash after taking a superficial look at it. In all, I think this episode was extremely mixed in terms of quality.

Even though it was written by James Duff who is the brilliant mind behind the series, & even though he always said he had the last scene written before he even got the show on the air, & even though producer Greer Shephard lobbied for the show, which was written for a male lead character, to feature an older, childless woman instead, & all the other ""even thoughs"" I could add, the last episode was incredibly unsatisfying & not up to the standards it set for all other crime dramas.

There are elements of this episode that were really great & smart, but I'm going to talk about them after I list my complaints. First, having all her colleagues abandon or dislike her in this episode is cr ap. I absolutely hated how Pope ended up relating to her. She was an amazing interrogator who, in seven years, brought virtually every suspect to justice & the way Pope & other characters were contrived to want her gone is just insulting to her & entirely unbelievable. More importantly, it was unnecessary to the resolution of the series.

In these last few episodes the Brenda character has been diluted to the point that she's unrecognizable. I watched old episodes as bookends to this episode, including the Stroh episodes. Brenda was not Brenda anymore. This was entirely unnecessary. Many people here have posited plot lines for the last few episodes that were much better than the one James Duff & Mike Berchem ended up writing.

Fritz, who's never been able to keep his hands off Brenda, didn't kiss or hug her once in this episode. Even when they were in the bedroom & Brenda was crying, he didn't touch her. To me, this speaks to the device applied to every other relationship in this last show--as if the people who loved Brenda suddenly couldn't touch her, support her or care about her, as if everyone agreed suddenly that it was time for her to go, to be FIRED, of all things. This is unbelievable.

If you visited the TNT site in the last two months & saw the photos of the cast lineups for MAJOR CRIMES, noticing that Pope & Gabriel were both gone & Fritz was still there (which everyone said was not going to happen, indicating that Jon Tenney had some kind of HBO deal that would take him away from the show, which would have been better), you knew there had to be some kind of big change that each of these characters could have had, showcasing their true personalities. But in the end, they were given short shrift & that is just insulting to them & to everyone who has put this show on a pedestal for so many years.

Worst of all is the absolutely stupid way Gabriel was turned into the leak by suddenly having this whiny girlfriend appear who somehow fakes him out for a year. This guy's a detective. He would have figured it out long before that.

But he never should have been the leak in the first place. Fritz was the only person who could have been the leak & it would have made perfect sense for him to be it. You could watch his fears for Brenda grow over the last few seasons & he made comment after comment to her about not wanting her to put herself in danger so many times. He may have expressed his fears most pointedly in ""Fresh Pursuit,"" when he said, ""Baby, you've used up your nine lives,"" or words to that effect. If Brenda could forgive Gabriel for being the leak, she sure could have forgiven Fritz & understood his motivations. Gabriel didn't know every detail that was passed on to Goldman. Fritz did. You can see him coming into the squad room or being in the squad room or being anywhere that anything happened that Goldman knew. Only Fritz would have known every single thing Brenda feared or suffered. No way would it be Gabriel or anyone else. Her relationship with Fritz is the one that meant more than anything else. He's the only person she completely trusted.

The contrivance of including Raydor in every scene, standing in Pope's office for one reason or another, was lame. I like the Raydor character & even liked the way she softened up over the years. But having her tacked on to these scenes so she could head up MAJOR CRIMES was lazy & uncreative.

The emotions expressed by Brenda's team as she was saying goodbye were uneven & unfair to her. It was obvious that Phillip Keene & Raymond Cruz were really crying & had been crying in real life, on the set, during shooting. Tao & Provenza were the next most-emotional of the characters. But Gabriel & Flynn--what was up with them? ""Not a wet eye in the house,"" as Provenza said about Flynn's eulogy for his old partner.

But I cried during this scene just like the more-sensitive detectives because I felt the way they felt. This was a real goodbye by real people to real friends with real love.

There are other things I could get picky about, but I come to praise James Duff, not to bury him.

I thought the resolution of the Philip Stroh story line was brilliant. It was nothing like anything I could have ever imagined. As self-possessed as he has been throughout the years, it was completely logical that his character cracked when pushed past the breaking point. Rape is not sex; it's about power. But rapists are cowards who can only have power by devastating their victims. Stroh was a coward whose vulnerability was finally exposed in this episode. For him to be unable to control his urges to the point where he was self-destructive enough to come after Brenda, then to beg for his life & bargain with promises of truth & details may have been a little neatly tied-up, given the time frame, made perfect great sense to me. I loved the fact that Brenda didn't need to kill him, but as always, was true to herself & her own true sense of justice, of right & wrong, that she had from the day she decided to be a cop. She wanted the confession & she wanted to see him brought to justice & dealt with by the justice system. Way to go, Brenda. Way to go, James Duff.

Billy Burke was also amazing in this episode. I liked the first episode he appeared in but not the next. I have seen him in GILMORE GIRLS & in RIZOLLI & ISLES but have been unable to get very excited about him as an actor. This was a bravuro performance for him & I hope, if nothing else happens, that he is nominated for & wins an Emmy for it.

How could anyone not love Brenda firing her gun through her purse to bring him down? Symbolically, this was maybe the best thing that could have happened. Of course, she could have gotten to her purse faster & she could have pulled the gun out & aimed it in the same time it took to just get her hand around it, but the more I watch this episode, the more I like that bit.

& of course, how could any fan not just lose it when her squad replaced that purse & asked her how it looked & she replied, ""Looks like love,"" which was the first line she ever spoke in the first episode of this stellar series. I was sobbing by this time & can't believe Kyra kept it together long enough to say those three words.

Speaking of Kyra, I have been amazed so many times by what a phenomenal actor she is as she played this character for seven years. I've always liked her since the moment I saw her but she really shone in THE CLOSER. She's my hero, keeping her eye on the ball as people talked about Wall Street bankers who destroyed lives, knowing how she & Kevin were taken to the cleaners by Bernie Madoff. There are other moments where she stayed in character during scenes that touched on real events in her life but I'll forgo listing those. Let me just say she's a class act & a great actor who will probably never be given the due she is owed.

But I have to say I'm disappointed (though my feelings are mixed) that Brenda didn't get pregnant in this last episode. The transition from death to life, as she loses her mother & her career, would have been perfect. After watching how loving she was with Kitty & her baby kitties (you have to watch the outtakes on the DVDs to understand that last line), with Joel, with Charlie, with Gabriel, with Flynn, with her decision to marry Fritz, with her father & just a few others over seven years, creating a life out of love would have been the perfect way for Brenda to accept the final changes of her life as THE CLOSER.

I support anyone's decision not to have children so I feel very torn saying that. But it would just have been a great ending in Brenda's case.

The kid, Graham Patrick Martin, is a talented actor & I wish him great success. But I would have liked it more if Duff & the producers had decided to give other actors who gave great performances over the run of this series an opportunity to reprise their roles. I was especially sad to read an interview with Kyra where she was asked if Jason O'Mara would appear one more time as Bill Kroelick & she said it wouldn't happen. That character would have been fascinating to delve more deeply into because there was nothing of substance in the arrests & acquittals to prove he was an arsonist & a murderer. He wasn't. He could have been a hero but he never got the chance.

Speaking of not getting a chance, I guess we'll never find out who this Chinese guy is who's in every episode of this series, in the background, in the squadroom, slinging the bullhorn during the bomb threat, smiling at Brenda & Fritz's reception. I might not have paid him so much attention had he not also been in almost every episode of GILMORE GIRLS, in Luke's Diner, busing tables & serving burgers. He's the ""Where's Waldo"" of the television world. If I watched more television, I'll bet I'd see him in other series as well.

Now that I think about it, wouldn't it have been hilarious to have HIM be the leak in Brenda's squadroom?

Anyway, I've gone on a long time but I wanted to say much more than this about one of my favorite shows ever. There are only a few shows whose DVDs sit on my shelves or VHS tapes are cataloged in my boxes. THE CLOSER might be my favorite of all.

Endless thanks to James Duff, to Kyra Sedgwick & to TNT for this astonishing gift of episodic television. THE CLOSER will truly be missed.",1345593600,4,10235,4.3667892800840775

The kid who played Rusty was wonderful and loved how him and Brenda were so much alike in temperment and life. You have to watch last rites  episode first because things are said about her mother which will not make sense otherwise. Also Stroh showing up at her house , seems very unlikely.

And then came Season 7, or to be more precise, the second part of Season 7. After developing this fiercely dedicated, no-nonsense, iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove main character, the writers suddenly ditched it all and came up with the most overworked, tired, dreadful 1950s ending of them all - ""Professional woman suddenly sees the light and decides to spend the rest of her life doing something boring and taking care of hubby."" You really can't get much more sexist than that. (Notice that while Brenda ""discovered"" that she needed to quit working in the field so she could devote more time to her husband, Fritz is still very much on the job in the lackluster sequel to the show, Major Crimes.)

  2. We see the stunning final chapter of Brenda's plight to catch her archenemisis, attorney (and presumed rapist and murderer) Phillip Stroh.  The only case Brenda could not close.
  3. How the writers found a sensical way for Brenda to leave the show without killing her.  (Well done)
  Look I don't know much (I admit that), but the Closer is/was an excellent show, from season one to season seven.  The rewatch value of this show is very high.  New generations of crime buffs will enjoy this show for a long time.
  For those that remember that first season watching and rooting for Brenda.  Wanting to see Brenda prove herself to the other characters that she was the real deal.  Watching Brenda gain the trust and confidence of her team, the Brenda way was great.  One by one they all began to accept her and we saw the begings of a exceptional show, with good writing and great chemistry.  With each season the episodes just got better (but just don't take my word, see for yourself).

We got ""rebuffered"" 8 times during the program - 4 of those times we had to hit ""retry"" and the program started from the beginning - so we spent about double the amount of time that it should have taken to watch it - and the frustration was beyond annoying.

Brenda is stuck between a rock and hard place, trying to pursue a rapist/murderer, who is untouchable and trying not set off the chief prosecutor, who seems so young and only cares about winning any way possible.

I gave Season 7 only 3 stars because of the over-arcing theme this year, which seems to be to torment and destroy Brenda (the main character).  I ""hope"" things improve in the final 5 episodes this summer but it does not look good.  I will say the murders and investigations are all still very good and the usual crew of characters are still wonderful.  I even like her attorney but the storyline they are using turns me off more then makes me want to keep watching.

I will say the ""cases"" they are giving her a hard time over are the ones that made me stop to think about what happened, what is legal, what is right (not always the same thing) and what I would have done.

It has also suffered because in an effort to build a spin-off with the remaining characters, each show features one of them & it's just so awkward & obvious, the integrity of the script is gone. I love these characters but without Brenda, they can't hold up the show. If ""Raydor"" takes over Brenda's position it still won't help.

I love this show. I have every episode on tape & all of Season Seven from Amazon. But it needs to go away & it needs a proper burial. I'd love to see Brenda get pregnant at her age & for her & Fritz to leave the show.

One season. That's my prediction. Without Kyra Sedgwick, the show can go one bad season. 9*",1336953600,2,905,4.280701754385965

Season seven is one of my favorites, especially with the introduction of Mark Pellegrino as Brenda's lawyer Gavin Baker.

4477791,5,B004UXVDJA,"I had never watched ""The Closer"" before, as I had been overseas when it first came on the air.  I assumed it was just another procedural police drama, and I couldn't have been more wrong.  As it happened, the very first episode I watched was ""To Serve With Love,"" which has to be one of the funniest and smartest episodes to come down the pike.  G.W. Bailey (Provenza) and his partner in moonlighting, Anthony John Denison (Flynn) are hilarious, as is nearly everyone else in the cast. Not knowing the back story of the series led to some head-scratching moments while trying to figure out the rather convoluted relationships in the show, but it was no bar to enjoying all 42 minutes of this classic episode.  The writing is brilliant.  There are a lot of familiar faces as well: Kyra Sedgwick (Dep. Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson), of course, who plays the lead and is irritating and yet at the same time charming in her single-minded pursuit of justice, Southern-style; J.K. Simmons (Asst. Chief Will Pope), who I immediately recognized as the Farmer's Insurance guy and one of the folks fired by George Clooney in ""Up in the Air,"" among other things; Raymond Cruz (Det. Julio Sanchez) who I thought I only knew as the psycho druglord in ""Breaking Bad,"" but later realized had appeared in many other great roles down through the years; and a large number of other supporting cast members who play their parts to perfection.  I rarely buy single episodes, but this one was a must.  Now that I have seen a few reruns of ""The Closer"" on TNT, I can appreciate all the byplay even more. Looks like I'll be buying eight seasons worth of DVD's in the near future. Advice to Brenda Leigh: focus, focus, focus, and get a GPS, for God's sake!",1328054400,,1730,4.597402597402597

If you're purchasing episodes individually via Amazon Instant Video- definitely skip this one.  It has nothing to add to the story arcs of the season.

Until Season 7. There wasn't a bad show in the lot until this season. Some episodes were better than others in the preceding seasons, but never was there a season consisting entirely of mediocre, bad, and worst. The cast of superb characters and foils around Sedgwick has been reduced to sullen walk-ons. The elan has disappeared.

Season 7 is by far my favorite season so far, and I expect the coming seasons will be even better. Without spoiling too much, I will say that this season elevates the series from a standard police procedural (albeit a good one) to a commentary on the basic notion of right and wrong. The season is certainly different, but I think this much more thoughtful direction will allow it to stand the test of time.

4477819,4,B004UXVDJA,"Just want to correct the first reviewer--THIS season is the LAST season for the show. Expectations & guesses are going wild, trying to figure out how the plots will play out for the last season. Will Provenza find love at last, or will it come out that he & Flynn are gay & walk of into the sunset? Will Brenda get pregnant, as happens more times that you think during menopause? Will Tao be assassinated by an unhappy convict who was convicted because of Tao's amazing work on every case? Will Sanchez find love, a love that is worthy of the memory of his dead wife?

Will Gabriel be hand-picked to work with the Mayor's security detail, or groomed for upper management by Chief Pope? Will Pope, who's put on too much weight, have a massive heart attack, moving Brenda into his slot temporarily & perhaps permanently? Will Captain Raydor marry Commander Taylor?

Will cast members be killed off, one by one, or will there be some kind of ""going-away"" party as the squad deteriorates for some reason & these six police officers & Buzz find jobs elsewhere? Will they say goodbye with that famous group hug, like the one on the last show of Mary Tyler Moore?

Will we see the return of those horrible Dutton children one last time, or Bill Groelick hiding in the shadows for Brenda to come by? Will Charlie come to visit, in college at UCLA, an honor student?

Will the writers rise to the challenge & make the most amazing  transition from the reality of this show into the reality of unemployment? The writers & directors have been the worst thing about this season. That & their endless, stupid product placements & close-ups of Brenda's shoes. Maybe Jimmy Choo is getting a cut of the action.

For my money, this season is pretty much a 50/50 disappointment. Having Brenda chase after a murder suspect like a helpless little girl, Sir, slow down, please, please! Grrr---rrrr! Oh <weepy face> Sir, please, wait, please!

That's not how Brenda rolls. I love this show because it's about an amazingly strong woman unaffected by the fuzziness of emotions. She remembers everything about handling a case, while others are saying, ""Chief, whatcha wanna do?""

Don't get me wrong. I love to see her cry, too. But she doesn' just cry over anything. When she cries, it's because of something that makes us cry, also.

I have never seen a female character so well developed & worthy of everyone's respect. She is it!

So I'll forgive the lame-duckness of 7th season & will be loyal to the show that's so good, I watch episodes of it on my DVR before I'll watch a regular t.v. show.",1315699200,24,2572,4.608315098468271
4477820,5,B004UXVDJA,"There are only 4 television shows I actually watch and for 7 years, this has been one of them. I have waited for each new season and watched each episode avidly.  Kyra Sedgewick is amazing - alternately sweet and savage and always, always, always driven by a purpose - get a confession.  She is sensational in this role but she does not stand alone.  Each of the cast members has grown and changed over the last 7 years, each contributes to the overall show.

And while praising the series, you cannot forget the writers who have had a wonderful run with The Closer.

The two part episode where Brenda, Fritz, Flynn and Provenza travel from Atlanta to LA in her parents RV with an armed robber in custody is funny, poignant and finally forces Brenda to tell her Mom what she really does day in and day out as the Deputy Chief of one of the largest police forces in the country.  Well-written and superbly acted, the closing minutes of this episode bring tears to the eyes of all but the most jaded.

And these writers don't just do drama.  Who else could have come up with an episode where Pope, Flynn and Provenza hand over all the evidence at a shooting to a Detective named...Dick Tracy?  What about ""Junk In The Trunk?""  In this episode, Flynn is on the phone with Brenda when the car with the body in the trunk slips off the tow truck, flies down the hill behind him, hits a telephone pole and has a live electrical wire drop on it. Flynn, Provenza, the body in the garage and the ball game make up another hilarious episode.

I highly recommend this series, LOVE the Closer retrospective included in the Season 2 discs and will hate to see Kyra Sedgewick leave at the end of this season.",1315440000,78,1693,4.411575562700965

Say something like, her finding out that it was Pope all along who was leaking information to the other side so he can keep his job as chief of police. Or, Brenda finally realizing that he was never her friend! OMG, I can't wait until she finally realzies that! But best of all, the mayor admits that he always wanted to choose her for the job but he knew she wouldn't get rid of Pope but in light of his deceitful behavior, he is appointing her the new chief of police and althought Taylor is a kiss ass, and gets on every body's nerve, he is confident that she can handle him now that she is chief of police. That means that her whole squad will move up in rank and they can just ride off into the sunset.  That's what I want to see happen!",1315353600,4,975,4.046632124352332
4477822,2,B004UXVDJA,"This is my favorite show ever since Monk went off the air two years ago.  I really love the quirky humor paired with the serious situations, the fabulous acting and directing, and the relationship dynamics within the squad and their families.  I like the fact that the crime scenes aren't gory, the actors are (most times) not too immodest, and the murderers though violent and angry aren't totally depraved.

Since the beginning of the season the writers have obviously been trying to show what the strain of the impending civil case is doing to the squad and to Brenda especially (culminating in her emotional breakdown at the end of this show). However, this strain has not been offset by any real humor (except in the last show), there have also been major power upheavals that I feel haven't been written well (the new chief of police's sudden death and Pope's promotion to fill that spot, Taylor's almost-promotion to assistant chief), and Pope's poorly explained betrayal of Brenda to the audit of Cpt Raydor (in the face of years of faithfulness on his part).  In fact there is betrayal all over the place, almost all the murder cases so far have had as one of their main motives a betrayal.  Betrayals of trust, fidelity, friendship, etc.  In this recent show, the squad believes Gabriel has betrayed them by taking a deal or talking with the prosecuting attorney, even though it was a scheme concocted by the attorney.

Besides the ongoing background tensions, this particular show was another in a long line of shows designed to show the hypocrisy of a Christian minister and his family.  Some may applaud this.  And I will admit that there is a lot of hyprocrisy and sin in the American pulpits and even in the main body of Christians today.  However, I challenge anyone that thinks this is a fair rendering to find even one show (aired on the major networks) that takes the other side and shows a likeable, faithful, God-honoring minister (or person).

In short, the season up to now has been mostly depressing to watch.  I still have hope that it will turn out alright in the last part of the season, but I fear the writers will continue down the same track and will leave this season and subsequently the show depressing and disatisfying to watch.

8442476,5,B004UXVDJA,"This is one of the most engaging drama series ever produced. Powerful, thought-provoking, engaging. The cast is fantastic and the character development masterful. Each episode is a little masterpiece. There are a few that stand out: Maternal Instincts, Smells Like Murder, and my pick for best episode; Road Block.",1525824000,,314,5.428571428571429

Major Crimes is so much better without her.",1523491200,,92,4.411764705882353

8442479,5,B004UXVDJA,"IN my opinion this is one of the best crime dramas ever on TV. I loved that Brenda Leigh Johnson was flawed, not just a little flawed but very flawed, yet still a good person and good at her job. She made LA safer even if it meant bending some rules to do it and I think this is what happens sometimes. I just wish she shot Philip Stroh when she had the chance. I hated that that guy continued to be a menacing charcter through out the spin off series Major Crimes, which is also an excellent show. What a time for her to find a consciences, the guy went on to terrorize all her friends for years, killed God knows how many more innocent people, and then poor Rusty had to be the one to finally put a bullet in him. Still it was an amazing show, fantastic writing, a fantastic cast and the spin off Major Crimes with Mary McDonnell taking over the lead role was nearly as as good. I realized when I watched The Closer again what it is that I liked about this show better. Sharon Raydor was just soooo good, I liked her but she was about as close to the perfect person as you could get. Brenda Leigh Johnson was like most of us, she tried to be a good person, and in her heart she was, but like most us she was flawed, so she had to keep on trying. I wish Kyra Sedgwick would do another series because she's a terrific actress!",1521763200,,1326,4.064885496183206
