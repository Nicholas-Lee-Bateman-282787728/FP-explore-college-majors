6165821,5,B00HHYF5EI,"The movie is real, real people, real decisions. Many may not like it and its not going to end the way most movies end but the world is not all butterflies flying to the sky, sometimes people just fall and this movie shows us what happens when things go spiraling out of control.",1392076800,3,278,4.264150943396227
6165822,5,B00HHYF5EI,"This is a great film for quite a few reasons. Since the other reviewers mention a lot of them. Ill say ditto to the 4 and 5 reviewers and add my bit.
For me this film was about separation from the plan an individual makes when they are young, and finding out that that path is not necessarily the one which is right for you.
Marc seemed to come from a family of policemen and had been groomed by that family to follow in their footsteps. Anyone who has support from their parents will understand this. Parents love by trying to make sure their child doesnt make the mistakes they made or they saw others make. They mean well, but often don't see who their child truly is. The child is a child so blindly follows the chosen path, until they wake up.
Sometimes they wake by themselves, sometime an incident wakes them. In this case Kay woke Marc.
Basically if/when you wake up, it can be painful, as you realize you are truly alone in the world. However once you make peace with that, it is ever so liberating and you are free to be who and what you chose.
 I believe this is why we are always told not to be in such a rush to grow up. It takes time to learn how to observe before you act. This is why many of us end up with houses, spouses and children without ever understanding that these things are not what we are looking for. Or if we do want these things, we do not take into account how much of our Selves we have to give to each of these things.
As far as the gay angle, well we humans love to persecute any thing, idea or one that is different, which to me translates as if you are persecuting someone you are either jealous or afraid... Yeah,  you are a Pussy. Instead of lashing out, go inside and figure out what the hell scares you so much and face it. Yes, gay person here. Great film on many levels.",1391904000,74,1813,4.1331444759206795
6165823,4,B00HHYF5EI,"The lead actors in this film are fantastic. The storyline is as it has been explained in other reviews. Sadly, life doesn't turn out OK for any of the principal players by the movie's end. All suffer terrible emotional pain, but will ultimately struggle through and survive. Not a Hollywood or fairy tale ending, but representative of reality.  The film also shows that despite substantial progress made by gay people, homophobia and violence against gays still happens--even in relatively progressive 21st century Germany.",1391904000,13,523,5.301204819277109
6165824,5,B00HHYF5EI,"I going to write this review without giving anything away. Let's start with the whole cast. They acted the heck out of these parts. i almost forgot to read the ""English"" subtitles. I had an ideal of what the story was because every where I looked for clips and spoilers. Well I found them. It still doesn't hurt or give away from this well written and well believed movie, I was so desperate to see this movie, As I said I watched every clip I could. I loved the love stories, and especially the 2 beautiful male leads. Character names Marc & Kay. i am praying to the the Director gods that there is a sequel. I loved the digital copy so much that I will be buying DVD when is released in March.... I love those type of movies that you know that when you read about it and see clips months in advance that you feel like it a great kept secret, but know that the whole world is in on it. Okay i know I said I would try not to give anything way. Well I won't But I'll give you something to pull you in. ""Marc's Mom""!!! To quote a great line from a movie this is loosely based like. ""Broke back Mountain"". ""Marc's mom"", to Kay.... How can you say that to me.. How? I love this movie... I can not wait to get the movie as well. This is a Classic, please pick it up when is released, or if you can't wait like me. Rent a digital copy. I have 2 more days to watch this again. I will enjoy it like it was my first time. ""Pun"" intended.

I am hoping that Stephan Lacant, The Director reads my review.",1391904000,5,1492,4.023569023569023
6165825,4,B00HHYF5EI,I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end to very good actors who did a very good job with making the movie believeable. I wish there was a continuation to see how Marc continues with his freedom.,1391817600,5,197,4.351351351351352
6165826,4,B00HHYF5EI,"Released in Germany as `Freir Fall' this has been compared to `Brokeback Mountain', but apart from it being about a man who is gay in a heterosexual relationship, I can't really see any other similarities. We meet Marc who is a cop and he has a pregnant girlfriend and what appears to be a life plan. Then at the academy he meets Kay who is more free whelin' than him and after getting off on the wrong foot they slowly hit it off.

Now despite the police or polizei being all inclusive these days there is still a vast undercurrent of homophobia and this is shown and there is some violence. Soon Marc realises what he wants and moreover who he wants but societal pressures and the arrival of his new baby son are all contributing to making him want to hurt the one he really loves.

This is a rather good film the two male leads are always guaranteed to put in a solid performance.  Marc is played by Hanno Kofler - `Krabat' and the excellent `Summer Storm'. Kay is played by Max Riemelt - `Napola' and `The Fourth State'. The sub titles are good to ok as they are not always a literal translation which I know some prefer but I like it told straight. This is a film that will not tick all the boxes, the ending especially may fail to deliver for some viewers; there is a limited amount of scenes of a sexual nature but nothing to frighten the horses of even a randy pony to be honest. However, this is still a very strong film with some excellent performances indeed - recommended to fans of gay themed cinema.",1391299200,121,1513,4.320422535211268

6165839,4,B00HHYF5EI,"Spoiler Alert!!!!
I enjoyed the movie until the end. Marc leaves his female partner and child to go back and do more police training, as the movie comes to its conclusion Marc is jogging with his fellow Police cadets and starts to run faster and leaves the group behind. I was hoping he would have come alongside Kay( he was hot)  but alas NO, for me that would have finished the movie off beautifully, Its obvious to me that Marc has finally been honest with himself and realised his future is with a guy not a woman. After writing this review, I have read they are in the process of going to make Free Fall 2 in 2018 with a release date at the cinema for late 2018 or early 2019, I only hope it has a happy ending, I'm so over Hollywood films that don't deal with the reality, that 2 guys can have a loving and meaningful relationship.",1525651200,,837,4.23125

6165885,4,B00HHYF5EI,"The blu-ray has a couple of problems, but they are serious.
One is there should be a director's cut, the deleted scenes should be included in a full version of the film.  Currently the deleted scenes have been loaded on-line, sometimes with the subtitles.
Also there should be a fuller version of the initial love scene (if you can call it that) betw the two male leads, if only because many people confuse the time lapse cutting (so we viewers don't really know how long the interaction is betw the men) into a real time representation.
There is another issue, but I did find an English-language translation on-line, that is the commentary offered up by the two male leads plus the director and it is a German language only track, no English subtitles available.  That seems inefficient for a blu-ray production.
The film succeeds because of the three leads and their intense commitment, but it falls short in some areas due the then inexperience of the director.  Frankly, if there is a sequel, I'm hoping the director and screenwriter are much improved or the project would be better left in the hands of the leads, as they saved this original film.
Otherwise for a blu-ray you might have to adjust your screen as the film was too dark until I made some screen adjustments and suddenly I was able to see faces that were otherwise obscure.",1511395200,2,1341,4.673728813559322

6165901,5,B00HHYF5EI,"This is a story of two men in their discovery about a love so very intense that it blurs all other actions surrounding them.  It is a story of how cultural restrictions push these two into a amalgam an of reactions in trying to deal with the controversies.  It is a scene that is played out over and over again, around the world, no matter the culture!!  NJMJr!!
PS The conflict that these two men experience is totally unjustified according to any legal system.  Some people would have you believe that their conduct is against the laws of God!!  What a f----- u- interpretation of the Holy Scriptures!!!  Every time you have such radicalism take place in a major religion, it completely degrades and undermines its authority and provides for a disintegration of its morality according to history!!

6165903,5,B00HHYF5EI,"That is this movie in a nutshell. But omigosh what a fantabulous nutshell it is.

This is regular life brought to you by two great actors with a palpable connection of which they take full advantage. They fully inhabit these two people who find themselves in the middle of a love maelstrom. And, of course, it doesn't just impact them, but also family and their professional lives.

Being honest with one's self is sometimes the most difficult thing, especially when there's fear in being honest with those who love you and accept your love right back. This is Marc and his life, and now with his new work partner, Kay.

Sparks fly. It turns into a hurricane. They both try to hold on.

I love this film. I've watched it several times since it's release and still love it. For as much story as we get here, there is potential for a lot more. Lucky for us, the Indigogo campaign for a sequel continues to gain funds and all of those involved in this film are on board with that follow up. I cannot wait.

6165905,5,B00HHYF5EI,"Excellent filming and lighting and sound for a small production. Acting is overall pretty dang good. I would say this movie is worth picking up as a extremely well made example of what a small gay movie should be like.

The story... not the most original in short it's a modern day Brokeback Mountain without the tragic ending with it's eyes firmly on a romantic sequel. I would put this smack dab in the top ten of small gay cinema of the last few years. Good job, worth a quick rental at the very least.",1500595200,,505,4.315789473684211

6165929,4,B00HHYF5EI,"A very interesting and complex film. There is a prominent adage in psychology circles that what attracts people to either the military or police work as professions ,is an internal lack of order, and the need for rules from an external source. The adage seems to apply here. Mark, especially is a person who is looking for answers as to how to behave in society. He attempts to follow every rule presented to him, and mete them out, but gets completely thrown off by his attraction to his police classmate, Kay.
I'm not at all convinced that Mark is gay. He is so self-centered that he seems to lack the capacity to engage emotionally with anyone ,and there is not much hope he will, even after deciding to leave the structure of his girlfriend and baby, and relationship with Kay. He'd best stay in the police department where the structure is clear, rigid and codified.
Kay, on the other hand really has a chance to succeed in life. He may break away from the police department, is much more grounded about his sexual orientation and emotionally mature.
The acting in the film and pacing is uniformly great. All the actors do a great job in their roles and it's interesting to see a slice of modern German society in action.
An long known fact is that in societies where there are rigid cultural and gender rules, the incidents of homosexuality is much greater than in societies where the gender roles are much more relaxed. Germany has always been an overtly homophobic society and has had an underground of gay sub culture. It would be worthwhile to see how many gay folks there are in the German police department, nationwide.
 The other thing I enjoyed about the film is that not a scene in the movie was wasted. Even the small scenes seemed to be going somewhere and where there for a reason. Well worth buying the film to watch again at another time.",1499817600,,1858,4.57957957957958

6165932,4,B00HHYF5EI,"I really liked it, though I would understand if someone else didn't. While the story of the relationships between him and Kay and between him and his wife were very compelling, there was no exposition whatsoever, which made the beginning a bit weird and clumsy. The cinematography was good. I liked it less for the actual quality of the filmmaking and more because it's set in Germany and is a compelling gay love story, and I am both gay and have lived in Germany. In other words, I could relate to it on a somewhat personal level. I recommend it, but I'd say it's targeted to a mostly gay audience (I've heard it compared to Brokeback Mountain; I would say that's not a fair comparison to make. Brokeback Mountain definitely appeals to a wider audience and has the potential to affect pretty much anyone, gay or not; Free Fall is also a compelling story but is more of a ""gay drama"" as opposed to a ""romantic drama that happens to be about gay people."")

6165936,5,B00HHYF5EI,"I heard this described as a German ""Brokeback Mountain"" - a concept difficult to grasp given that it takes place in the present and that Germany, generally speaking, is a good deal less homophobic than the US.  Anyway, this film tells the story of two police cadets who rather suddenly, inexplicably fall hard for each other.  The one cadet, Kay, is close to being openly gay and has few qualms telling Marc, the other cadet, that he wants him.  Marc resists and then caves time and again until he finds himself in love.  With a kid on the way and parents living next door, you can feel him being smothered.  The other officers have accepted Marc into the fold but only as a straight man.  (They marginalize and discriminate against Kay.)  And the only way Marc seems to get any credit from anyone in his life is by engaging in ""traditional"" male behavior - except for Kay who genuinely cares for Marc and is quite unhappy without him.  How Marc reconciles all of this is the conflict at the center but what a conflict it is!  It does involve some of the themes in ""Brokeback Mountain"" - feeling stuck between two worlds, discomfort in one's skin, brazen homophobia - but it ends there.  It concludes on a ??? note which is all I can really say.  The writing is strong and compelling and the acting is spot-on.  The direction is wise - it is accurate, meaning that it spends just the right amount of time with each couple.  It also uses images to highlight aggression and homophobic violence.  It doesn't preach.  It assumes the audience will have the right reaction.  Of course, there is the issue of ""sex scenes"", an issue I only address because people obsess over it.  The gay scenes are something I would like to see more of - realistic, assumptive, emphasis on kissing and caressing, simply classy.  Queer men and most straight women would probably approve and secure straight men would probably just shrug (and that makes for well over 60% of the viewing audience - just a note to Hollywood).  I rather liked this film - it catches the imagination and presents a very real dilemma that really does take place.",1496275200,10,2115,4.577127659574468

6165958,3,B00HHYF5EI,"Some aspects of this movie struck me as a sexual/political fantasy by the filmmaker.  Also, while we are given a fairly straightforward story line, there's little character development to help us understand how the married protagonist, Marc,  is so easily drawn into a gay relationship from which he is obviously helpless to extricate himself.  Prior to being ""seduced"" (if that's the right word) there is nothing that would suggest he is anything but a straight, married and expectant father.  This also makes it difficult to empathize with him, since he is continually lying to his wife.  He comes off as being more irresponsible than anything else, since we don't see what inner, inexorable psychological driver prevents him from resisting his impulses.  He does say, when the truth finally comes out, that he ""doesn't understand"" how it happened - but then, really,  neither do we.  There's also a predatory aspect to Kay, the gay seducer, which I found pretty unappealing.  Like a stalker, he is unrelenting and seems to care little about the consequences.  A character like that simply gives ammunition to those who see gay men as having predatory natures.  I would say that the anguish Marc feels when his relationship with his wife is falling apart was performed very well, and was moving.",1488326400,,1297,5.014018691588785

* Lack of clear causal relationships

That said, the chemistry between the two guys was often hot, even if they didn't seem to have much to say to each other. Some other reviewers found the level of homophobia to be unrealistic, but I didn't.

The story, in itself, is very engaging, considering the angst that the two male characters experience in the telling of it.  Very strong feelings are clearly shown and generally, reciprocated.  This only adds to the difficulties encountered within the characters individual determinations.  The reaction of the lead female character, whilst apparently beneficial, results, only, in the furthering of the confusing in their continuing attempt to resolve the impasse.  The performances are excellent from all the significant characters in this difficult scenario with the visuals carrying most of the story and the audio as a necessary adjunct.  Even without understanding the spoken words, I was able to enjoy, audibly, the emotions in the voices portrayed by the characters.  All round a thoroughly, enjoyable film.

Excellent acting all around! This movie broke my heart and made me root for the affair, the love, the honesty. Also, just for the record, I am a heterosexual girl who loves a good love story that's complicated and involved (in this case layered).

6166266,4,B00HHYF5EI,"A powerful film about love and loss.  Two men in the police training academy find themselves in a relationship of sorts and eventually falling in love after two remote moments of giving into their feelings.  One man is not ashamed of who he is and lives his life fairly freely while the other has a pregnant girlfriend and his judging parents living right next door. Marc is a man who despite having it all finds himself drawn to Kay and cannot seem to walk away no matter what the cost.
This movie was so good, it was raw with real emotions from everyone from Marc's mother to his confused and angry girlfriend. The main characters were so believable and their relationship was so filled with such emotion and raw energy. People who compare this to Bareback Mountain are not giving this movie justice as it stands on its own merits.

It touches on the whole bi-sexual vs straight vs bi-curious debate, of which I will not get into, simple because male sexuality is way too vast to try and philosophize it.  However, I will say this, I don't believe in ""no strings attached sex"" ... especially if a person has been that intimate with another person. I also don't think it's a good idea for married or partnered people to have affairs with single people.  It will only lead to trouble, as this film points out very well.

6166273,5,B00HHYF5EI,"I'll be honest, I rented this movie because the phrase ""gay German cops"" and the word ""hot"" simply equate in my mind. I was thinking a cute, romantic movie to cuddle up with on the weekend.

I wasn't prepared.

This movie is soul-crushingly unrelenting in the feels department. The odd part is, comparing it (as it so often is) to Brokeback Mountain, it's more ""tame"" in the sense that there's no high-drama craziness going on. It felt like something that could easily happen in my life or, for that matter, anyone's life. This is the key to why it's so deeply moving to watch: it doesn't even feel like a movie.

The main characters (played by Hanno Koffler, Katharina Schttler, and Max Riemelt) are just people (albeit very hot people) who you could easily fall into the social circle of. They are all wonderful actors and, in particular Ms. Schttler, makes for one of the most personable, relatable characters I've ever seen in a movie. She's utterly perfect at portraying the emotions that a REAL person in her situation would have. Again, it's not over the top, it's eery how perfectly she captures the true emotions.

That all isn't to say that Mr. Riemelt and Mr. Koffler can't hold their own, though I think Mr. Riemelt was the stronger of the two performances. They also make for some very hot sex scenes. OH, FYI, there is nudity (full frontal male) in this, so if you're skiddish about it you'd be better on passing this one up... though if that was the only reason then you're missing out.

And to be clear, this movie is not a happy movie. It's not a feel good love story, just like most of life is not a feel good love story.

That's why I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's not a Brokeback tearjerker. It's what Brokeback turns into when it grows up.

I would give it more stars if I could.",1432598400,4,1818,4.490909090909091

6166277,3,B00HHYF5EI,"I, too, had the issue that this Blu-ray disc does not play in my North American Sony receiver/player even though it says Region A/1.  The seller apologized but has not yet authorized me to return the disc until I try it in a Samsung or LG player, which I do not own and do not know anyone who owns one.  I finally bought the movie as an amazon HD download so I could watch it--though the PQ isn't quite as good as a Blu-ray disc--however, I am still stuck with a disc that I cannot play.

The film itself was very entertaining.  However, I agree that the ending was very unsatisfying and feels incomplete.  Besides, when Marc discovers that Kay has moved out of his apartment, and Marc returns to see him again, Marc still had his cell phone number.  These days, with cell phones and the Internet, it's difficult to understand how, even if you cannot locate someone physically because they've moved, you cannot reconnect with them technologically.",1430524800,,947,4.57396449704142

I am always amazed at how many gay films show kisses that are as natural as Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. Even in otherwise good films.  I don't want  to see an excess of intimacy  in any film (I'm still traumatized by the Thomas Crown Affair), but make the passion believable.

Thought the ending could have  been better.  Sometimes I think Europeans abhor a happy ending.  There was plenty of  tragedy without leaving the end so bleak  and without resolution.",1430438400,,623,4.809523809523809

6166317,4,B00HHYF5EI,"**NOTE: Contains spoilers.**  A nice film in almost every respect.  The ending could have been a bit stronger, I think.  I think there was just a tad too much involvement of Bettina - I really wanted to believe that Marc is completely gay and not just swinging both ways.  But I couldn't. I found myself rewinding and watching certain parts again, because I missed certain subtitles.  It's hard to say what's ahead for Marc...he's got a substantial challenge ahead of him with the soon-to-be-ex wife and kid.  I know a lot of guys go through this. The actor who plays Kay is gorgeous, and a good actor.  The actor who plays Marc is excellent.  The two of them worked very well together and I could definitely feel their strong attraction; Kay and Marc belong together but sadly, that's probably not going to happen.  The supporting actors, including the actress who played Bettina, are mostly nothing great.  I didn't like the whole set-up of Marc's family finding out about his homosexuality.  Pretty silly.  Could've been accomplished differently.  I do like army/cop set-ups like the one in this film though...they can get very steamy.  Kay and Marc smoke way too much though - it seems to be a common thing in many gay films, as if all gay guys smoke.  We don't!! I kept wondering when one of them was going to go into respiratory failure during their intensive athletic training.

The title of the film remains perhaps the most interesting element.  I guess it's up to the viewer to decide what 'Free Fall' means...I think it refers to Marc.  But, I won't try to analyze that in this review.

Definitely worth watching, and better than the average gay film.  It's a very real story, nothing phony, and that's what most of us prefer I think.",1420243200,5,1745,4.677631578947368
6166318,5,B00HHYF5EI,"Five stars without a doubt.  It presents the real world of many people most of whom in that world are struggling to understand and cope with the issue of homosexuality.  They are not necessarily hate filled and intolerant. The two men meet at a training course at the police academy and are beautiful and sexy.  Marc immediately dislikes Kay (who was gay) and picks a fight with him which  probably came from Marc's repressed feelings that he may not have recognized.  After being reprimanded by their trainer they develop a friendship. You cannot help but to love them and I can identify with the repressed attraction to men and the anguish of the main character.  While out jogging there was a quick kiss which Kay made off as a joke  That stolen kiss was oh so real and a shock to  Marc.  Kay passed it off as a joke. They went jogging again and this time Kay forced himself embracing and passionately kissing him.  Marc physically and emotionally resists but partly gives in as Kay fondles him.  This is against  everything he believed and wanted for himself. Panic immediately sets in as the repressed emotion and attraction will not go away and he flees

Training has ended and both have returned to their police departments.  We find that Marc has a girlfriend and a baby on the way  They have a house that Marc's parents helped buy. The future looks rosy in the straight world with a family, love and a career.  In the meantime Kay who has fallen in love with Marc transfers to Marc's Police Department.  Marc is furious and Kay learns about Marc's life even meeting Marc's girlfriend and integrating himself into the department.  Then one day Kay asks Marc if he would like to go jogging.  Then apparently Marc initiate their meeting to jog in the pouring rain.  It's a passionate meeting with Marc taking the lead. The attraction is overwhelming, the affair begins, Marc loses his sexual attraction to his girlfriend.  There's a birth, proud fatherhood and love that weakens as Marc is torn between his homosexuality and the ideal life he had planned. Marc tries to breaks off with Kay even though it was Kay only that he loved.  Rejected Kay gets himself outed at a gay bar where he gets drunk, then beaten up by a fellow officer. This led to a chain of events where Marc is outed.  He makes the break with  Kay and Kay transfers out.  Marc's girlfriend breaks with him.  Marc is devastated.  They attempt reconciliation to no avail. They are all deeply wounded.  No one meant to hurt anyone.  Marc finally accepts his homosexuality.  Kay has disappeared and his apartment is empty.  All is lost.  As some on who spent most of my life  in denial and the closet I felt all his pain and lost joy.  Yes, the ending is bleak, yet there is hope.  The closing scene has Marc back at he academy where the story began.  He has no room mate this time (Kay was his room mate).  Kay could show up for some training.  Kay did not leave in anger or bitterness. Marc loves him and should be easy to find.  I want a sequel.  This is one of my favorite gay themed movies.

6166336,4,B00HHYF5EI,"Calling Freier Fall/Free Fall the ""German 'Brokeback Mountain'"" is tempting because of the similarities (and almost as bleak an ending, though not quite). However, it's not an entirely accurate comparison for a few reasons.

First, Brokeback Mountain followed the two lead male characters and the development of their relationship with each other, as well as their separate lives away from each other -- over multiple decades and locations. Second, Brokeback Mountain was very much about both Jack and Ennis and their love.

Free Fall's two male characters are not both equally developed or followed. Marc, the previously hetero cop, is the primary focus. The changes in his life are portrayed (as well as the consequences and fallout).

Also, in Brokeback Mountain, both men were presented originally as heterosexuals, who went on to maintain 'normal' heterosexual relationships with women more or less successfully in terms of what was expected of them (marrying, having kids, raising families).

By contrast, Free Fall primarily follows what happens to Marc while he moves in to a new house next door to his parents with his pregnant girlfriend and slowly, simultaneously gets involved with a gay fellow cop. While his girlfriend and his lover are also portrayed, Marc is the primary character.

Kay, the cop Marc falls in love with, identifies as gay, though he is not openly gay at the police academy where they meet. The relationship between Marc and Kay is not portrayed over the long span of time that Jack and Ennis' relationship occurred in Brokeback Mountain. It is followed over a much shorter time span.

One similarity between the two films is the homophobic environments in which these male/male relationships arise. As enlightened as modern Germany may be, police forces tend to be less so, rather like the military, especially for open homosexuals or lesbians.

Though not delved into as deeply as it was in Brokeback, we also see the consequences for one of the women involved with one of these men.

A question raised by both films--indirectly in Brokeback, but openly in Free Fall--is: is this man gay?

By having and continuing to have heterosexual relations, by being gay only with one other specific man, what are they?

**SPOILERS**
In Free Fall, while Kay identifies as gay and encourages Marc to do so, too, Marc refuses. He says he's not gay. Is that internalized homophobia, or is it his truth? During an argument, Marc's girlfriend Bettina asks him if he's gay, and he denies it. She demands to know, ""What are you then!?"" and he replies, ""I don't know.""

Marc, lonely (and probably looking for Kay after Kay has moved out and left no forwarding address), goes alone to the gay club where he and Kay used to go. He almost gets a blow job from a stranger in the bathroom -- but stops at the last moment, almost punching the guy out.

Is he homophobic?

Is he just angry because it's not Kay, the man he loves and wants and is probably looking for?

Or is it because he's not gay?

One senses, by the end of the film, that Marc returns to the academy and training because it is all he has left.

**END SPOILERS**

By the end of the film, we see that once you cease to be unambiguously heterosexual, you are perceived as ""gay"" whether you identify as gay, or not... with all the personal and professional costs attached to that perception.

By limiting its focus to one main character and restricting the time frame to a relatively short one, Free Fall lacks the sweeping, epic feel of Brokeback Mountain. Nevertheless, it is a well acted, well directed film that elicits sympathy for Marc, who unexpectedly finds himself on the outside of all he has known, just by loving someone he wasn't supposed to.

Also, the two male leads are pretty gorgeous and the sex scenes are pretty hot, so there's an eye candy appeal here. There aren't that many of them, and they aren't that explicit, though they are more explicit than Brokeback Mountain and (if I recall correctly) there are more of them.

If you liked the Jack/Ennis sex and romance scenes of Brokeback Mountain (or were one of the many women who didn't *know* you liked that sort of thing, until you saw it in Brokeback Mountain and were like, whoa, hot!), you'll like it in Free Fall.",1417132800,5,4265,4.784741144414169

6166372,5,B00HHYF5EI,"This was an excellent film, a gritty, realistic film but it's not a ""feel good"" film. It's been compared to Brokeback Mountain. To the extent it's about two guys who don't get what they want, it's like Brokeback Mountain. But the tragedy in Brokeback Mountain is romanticized with lush scenery and heart-string-tugging music. Frier Fall doesn't go there. It is dark and gritty and there's a feeling from the beginning that you're watching a catastrophe that you can't stop or stop watching.

I found a niggling ""gays must suffer in the end"" feeling about this film. Sort of in line with ""the gay character must die in the final reel"" style of early films with gay characters. It almost felt anti-gay. I don't look for ""ride off into the sunset"" endings by any means. That's unrealistic. But the feeling I had as the final credits rolled was that the breeders won as they usually do. Kay fled the scene having lost someone he obviously loved. Marc lost his wife, lost his child, lost his lover. The ending was very dark, lacking any glimmer of hope or healing. The final image, Marc running, didn't have the feel of running toward something. Just running much like a lab mouse running through a maze that it won't get out of. Heterosexuals win; Homosexuals lose.

And that's about all there is positive to say about this film.  It's S-L-O-W or ssssssslllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.  Kay's love interest is a neanderthal, and frankly, I was totally baffled by the attraction.

He may have had these deep seated  feelings for a long time, but had sublimated them and denied them. Now he has to learn how to deal with the collateral damage.

So if this is the case, it would make it possible that he indeed was fully engaged in a loving, fulfilling marriage with his wife... but yet discovered this 'something more' that he needs.

I can see why this film is being called the German Brokeback Mountain, but I believe this does the movie a disservice. While there are definite similarities in that both films are concerned with the struggles of seemingly straight men with their feelings, sexual and emotional, for another man; ""Free Fall"" is a more modern tale of sexual realization. There is tragedy, suffering and emotional loss, but not to Shakespearian levels. It is a contemporary story of the struggle to come to terms with one's sexuality and the impact that struggle can have on one's personal and professional life.

I give the actors credit for making the best of what they were given.  Although there was definite chemistry between the leads, there was no clarity about the deeper basis for their mutual attraction.  The character of the ""other man"" was poorly developed.  Why was did he have such a magnetic impact on the down-to-earth family man?  All we see of him is a certain aggressive, rule-breaking quality, aside from his physical charms.  What about him would cause a man to risk his career, break up his family, disappoint his parents?  And the lead does seem to love his wife and child and may not even actually be exclusively homosexual.  He is heartbroken by the pain he causes but cannot seem to explain or make amends or even make a decisive choice.

The actress who plays Bettina keeps the film afloat during most of the middle section and prevents it from falling into maudlin melodrama as it begins to play it by the numbers.  Kay begins to lose his potency toward the middle as he transforms from the seducer into the conventional jilted other man.  It sags toward the end but rebounds at the very last scene.  I wish the filmmaker kept the movie moving in the direction set in the first third of the film and promised by the title ""Free Fall"" with Kay as a dead weight and Marc plunging into self destruction.

6166438,2,B00HHYF5EI,"Freier Fall, in which two ostensibly straight males fall into bouts of illicit lovemaking in inhospitable locations, plays like an adolescent homosex phantasy. It's accordingly derivative and predictable, like most films that put homosexual arousal center stage, then figure out a scenario that will make the inevitable lip-locking as implausible as possible for the biggest pay-off. With rare exceptions (Marco Berger's Plan B comes to mind) this inevitable meeting of mucus membranes eventuates with the suddenness of an act of desperate violence. To that end Stephen Lacant spends an inordinate amount of time establishing the masculine bone fides of the protagonists, to such an extent that it threatens to become the main focus of the film. Given the plasticity of the male sexual response in homosocial environments, the scenario of two police cadets getting the hots for one another is not incredible--but neither is it novel or particularly interesting. Lacant has merely produced his version of the standard doomed gay romance. Films dealing with homosexual persecution and paranoia have been made since the 1970s (Wolfgang Peterson's Die Konsequenz and Claude Miller's The Best Way to Walk come to mind)--with greater nuance and humanity. The experience of inconvenient homoerotic arousal in and of itself is an insufficient thematic for average filmmakers, I don't care how much splicing and edgy verit stylization its packaged in. Protagonists whose sole purpose is to channel anomalous sexual predilections wind up as ciphers of animal mediocrity.

Freier Fall's similarity to Brokeback Mountain has been remarked upon. I would draw parallels with another recent film about illicit homosexual bonding, Nicolo Donato's disturbing Broderskab (Brotherhood 2009). Again, the comparison is to the detriment of the formulaic Freier Fall. Donato's film was vastly superior because the homosexual attraction wasn't front & center, but one factor in a complex of engaging, if rather horrifying, themes.

Max Riemelt, who plays Kay is a telegenic and engaging presence on screen, if not quite in the league of Volker Bruch in terms of intensity. Hanno Koffler as the repressed (or just clueless?) Marc broods with the best of them, but has the physicality of a Guinea Pig on steroids. A walking muscle-mass with tunnel vision, hair-trigger fuse, and a lecherous-malign glint in his eyes, he resembles a figure out of a Lucas Cranach portrait. Yet for all his irascibility, borderline autism, and  inarticulacy, he's not particularly spirited.

With cortisol surges and the fight-flight reflex dictating events, flying fists and sudden retreat are the inevitable outcome of every encounter that doesn't end in furtive homosex. I get that these two are struggling with illicit desires in a no-win situation, but their inability to converse with one another as persons radically limits their appeal. That well-spokenness kills the mood of rude and randy man-on-manism seems to be a generally accepted fact among primitivists and pornographers, but give me a break. These two academy trainees spend all their time either working out, fighting, or having sex. (You know, like real men...) Oh, and Marc has a pregnant girlfriend who turns into an real nag when his interest wanes, sealing the deal of his straight-arrow credentials.

Romance risks comedy when it confronts lovers with the necessity of its normalization. Once domesticated passionate partnerships generally transform into delicate, maintenance intensive stand-offs. Kay and Marc, inhabiting the realm of non-negotiable erotic impulses, never get that far. Their relationship, while tested by divided loyalties, lacks the civilizing dimension of habit and the intimacy of two minds meeting in sympathy. It remains a conflict (fight) resolved by the (SPOILERS!) sudden absconding (flight) of one of the partners.",1400371200,2,3873,5.491610738255034

6166441,3,B00HHYF5EI,"A good production but incomplete narrative & unsatisfying ending. There's not enough within this story to justify the happenings. *Maybe Spoilers* Handsome married Marc is at police academy and befriends hot, rule-bending Kay. We see Marc open to Kay's rule bending influence, but overwhelmingly we see him engaged in a happy married life with a lovely pregnant wife and supportive family. Almost randomly Kay forces himself on Marc. After some exposition of Marc's inner struggle, a sexual affair ensues. We see it coming, cause it's on the cover art for the film; but there's not enough in the story to see it coming. Later, although Kay doesn't seem the type, he professes love for Marc. After Marc's mother catches them kissing, Kay confesses his feelings to Marc's parents, when they confront him at a party at Marc's house, sooooo that's not right. The story isn't Fatal Attraction like so what gives? Obviously Marc has feelings of attachment to Kay but never confesses love for him. He denies being gay after the affair is discovered and the film even shows Marc unable to engage in sex with another guy during an emotional bottoming out. (I hate gay sex used as rock-bottom for an emotionally distressed person; as in ""Shame."") So therein lies the problem with the storytelling; What is the story telling? The unsatisfying end doesn't give closure. It gives an impression that Marc will be OK. But the good people around him and their stories are left shattered. That's not like Marc; he's no sociopath; so again, what gives? We might conclude he was suffocating in a really great life and the affair was his escape, but there was something specific for him about Kay, and nothing to indicate the emotional burden. Maybe it's a cautionary tale for ""hot for married guy"" gays; Look what your lust shall bestow! Nah, it's a story of self discovery; of the power, surprise and consequence of unexpected physical attraction, though it doesn't say so. Uptick to 3 stars for production, acting talent and many elements of the story that left me feeling a lot.

6166443,1,B00HHYF5EI,"The two main characters had a physical connection alright, but no emotional chemistry. They didn't even really like each other, and suddenly, they were having sex.

The story unfolded in a hostile environment that would have been right on target in 1980. The level of homophobia felt utterly anachronistic for Germany in 2013. Even more inappropriate was the  the unhappy ending. Brokeback Mountain's unhappy ending was credible and authentic because the movie took place in the 1950s. This one doesn't.

We've had decades of gay movies that almost always end badly. One or both characters are murdered, or die of AIDS, or chose to live a lie. If the filmmaker's intention here was to avoid a clich, then they got it all backwards. The happy ending is a clich in straight movies. In gay movies, it's still a revolutionary act. It's a bold, political assertion that yes, true happiness can be found in same-sex relationships.

If there was a pro-gay message to the movie, the ending undermined it completely. If it wasn't for the nudity and the fairly explicit scenes of gay sex, the usual suspects would be recommending this movie as a must-see moral tale of how the ""homosexual lifestyle"" ruins families and leads to self-destruction.",1399852800,13,1235,4.951690821256038

The story is well-written and the acting, extraordinary.

Hanno Koffler & Max Riemelt are exceptional.  They committed to their roles 110% and held nothing back (vodka on set - yeah, so?).  Koffler captures a huge range of feelings, from comfort and ease with Bettina, to the new and exciting and terrifying feelings he faces with Kay.

As for Max Riemelt, can I just say, thank you for your face?  Oh, and your body.  But seriously, his acting is so good, true and strong and more than believable.  He made me really feel for Kay; even though we know little about his character, we care for him.  And why is that?  Because Max makes us care.

Katharine Schuttler was great as well, giving her character all the hurt and feeling any woman would feel in her situation.  Her cry to Marc when he admitted the affair brought tears to my eyes.

I've watched it many, many times and continue to see nuances that I missed the first 20 viewings.

6166457,2,B00HHYF5EI,"This is an interesting film involving a gay man and a situational heterosexual man, but it ends in the typical manner  that most  films involving a romantic relation between a gay man and a  homosexual man married to a heterosexual woman end.  In the end, homophobia and the false sense of sexual-emotional entitlement of the heterosexual majority wins. The film's message is clear,  the love  between the two men must be sacrificed at the altar of dogma induced heteronormality.

I hope this is not how these types of relations play out in the real world. But, I am most likely wrong considering that the vast majority of homosexual men and women are imprisoned into marriage with heterosexual spouses and reduced  to 'playacting straight' (situational heterosexuality) for the sake of continuing  socio-religious orthodoxies rammed down their throats, and at odds with the very fabric of their nature. It is about time film makers began making right this inequity, but this movie only perpetuates this violation of human rights. Thus my rating.",1398038400,2,1046,5.105882352941176
6166458,5,B00HHYF5EI,"Sure this was a sad story.  There are many things to say about how such stories complicate the straight-gay binary, and how a lot of men just cannot fit into either category.  And how it is not cowardice, not closeted-ness, not simply internalized homophobia that makes relationships such as Marc and Kay's so incredibly complicated - - and why they most frequently do not end well.  So very sad- - I know it, and many dudes reading this must know it as well. The movie conveyed that sadness, that despair. What struck me, I guess, in this age of legal same-sex marriage and growing social acceptance of gay people marrying, is that relationships between ostensibly straight men, like Marc and Kay, are still such a threat to the straight family and to hetero-normativity.  Because as long as sex between men, and between women, pertains to a demarcated group- - gay men and lesbians - - defined (so they say) by genetics or something biological, then it makes sense to have such a bounded group have the same rights as everyone else.  But what if straight people also have lusts and loves for people of their own gender- - even after they are married to someone of the opposite sex?  How can this ever be accommodated by the hetero-universe?  It isn't.  That story was well told by this movie.",1397952000,5,1294,4.644736842105263

Briefly, Kay sees Marc at police training and literally stalks him until Marc gives in to his undeniable attraction, but he has a girlfriend and a baby. Kay and Marc's love deepens and choices need to be made. These 2 actors and the entire cast are terrific and the reason why I did 4 stars instead of 5?

The acting is totally good, script / plot is very believable, and I was drawn into the story without hardly any thought as to the mechanics of movie making.  Both main stars, Max Riemelt and Hanno Koffler, are superb as two policemen who become star-crossed lovers.  Koffler's character, Marc  is living with his girlfriend and they are expecting a baby anytime soon, so the complications are immediate.  Katharina Sch&uuml;ttler plays Marc's girlfriend very well, with the joy of romance and imminent motherhood, and the tragedy of discovering your partner has been in an affair, all portrayed with great skill.  Supporting cast are also all quite good, and editing is seamless.  The English version has the German language with English subtitles, but the movie is so good, you'll probably forget you're reading the subtitles very quickly.  It's good to hear these actors' voices anyway.
One side note:  The DVD has the two leading actor's names in the summary notes on the back cover confused with the other's role.  Also, Riemelt's name is misspelled as ""Reimelt"" in the leading paragraph of the Wolfe should correct this!

The problem is that he's about to become a father, lives with his pregnant girlfriend next door to his parents, and is falling in love with his Shadow, the handsome Kay, who knows he's gay.  Unable to process his feelings with words, Marc acts out and betrays everyone, including himself.  This is a brilliantly acted film.  That it is in German doesn't really matter, most of the message is visual in the body language.  Any man who has gone through the transition of fatherhood will be able to relate to the repressed feelings needing to get out.  How we deal with our feelings creates the consequences.

Yes it is erotic and the two protagonists are hot cops, but the story of a young ""straight"" cop who is a new father and his affair with a  gay roommate at his police academy, plays out in unexpected ways. You expect him to just have the affair and reject the man, going back to his straight life. But the affair changes something basic in him and he discovers too late how deep his feelings are. He also comes to terms with the ostracism a gay life can bring with both his shocked parents and his narrow minded straight co workers.

6166501,2,B00HHYF5EI,"I don't know why this got so many high reviews (maybe it's the gay movie review effect). Hopefully this review sets someone's expectations at the right place.

The characters are flat and impossible to sympathize with. Though they make huge decisions, we don't see or understand why they make them. Relationships are totally left to the imagination, with maybe a total of thirty seconds of interaction that allude to anything deeper than physical attraction. Dialogue between characters is overly simplistic. I understand that people like reading between the lines, but when there's no chemistry and no development, we basically have to make up the entire story ourselves.

The plot is (and supporting characters are) one cliche after another and is (are) rarely creative. Maybe it's too soon to expect gay movies to be surprising, but this movie was too heavy-handed and thick with it. Even the cinematography was too expected, too obvious. (Apparently, the weather is always beautiful in Germany after gay sex.)

The one redeeming factor was that it was so awful that making fun of it was actually pretty entertaining. Yes, there are worse movies, but I really think all the positive reviews here are because of gay movie rating inflation.",1394409600,6,1241,5.103448275862069

I came across the trailer for ""Free Fall"" and it seemed to have all the key buzz words in its marketing campaign.
There are typical stereotypes like the self-hating gay and your typical menacing homophobes.
Where the film turns is in its exploration how life outside of German metropolis', homophobia seems to be alive and well.

Even in these modern times with legalized marriage for same sex partners. The movie underscores that many parts of this world that loving someone of the same sex can still be challenged by the hostility of our parents, peers and the rest of society. As a gay male I have been with my partner for over 40 years but am still reminded by the struggle we faced  trying to survive against all odds. I wish it had ended with both police officers  living happily ever after. But reality shows its ugly face once again. The acting was so convincing that I was very much affected by the two gay police officers emotional conflicts, especially the main character who is married and is expecting his first child. It's a movie I will maybe watch only a few times because the ending was very heart breaking.

There were times I was no longer a viewer. I was there in the film, loving, crying, fighting, puzzled, heartbroken. There
is something about watching a film in a foreign language, a kind of freeing up from the dialog. Times when I don't care
what their saying, I just want to see and feel and hear and know everyone at some deeper level. The English subtitles are
great, not moving so fast as to keep your eyes reading them rather than watching the story unfold. The story ended and

6166534,1,B00HHYF5EI,"Did we really need another movie about how stupid straight men are, about how brutal homophobia is, or about how cowardly married men who lust after other men are? Haven't we gotten past this crap - like about 20 years ago?

Maybe they haven't in Germany. Maybe this movie (which is being touted as ""the German Brokeback Mountain"" by its US distributor) has a useful function for Germans, if they're really as thick-headed and slow as this movie makes them seem. But we gay men in the West, who've been fed the same old same old same old depressing homophobic crap year after year after year, have had enough already.

Like Brokeback (which I also hated) this is a movie BY straight people (on both sides of the camera) and FOR straight people, who really may be so dumb that they need to see it all over again. WE! DON'T!

I hated this ugly, depressing movie. Even Max Riemelt (Kay), one of the most beautiful men in the world, looks bad here - and what he would ever see in Hanno Koffler (Marc), one of the ugliest, is beyond imagining. There is no ""chemistry"" between them, by the way, only dark, slogging depression, dishonesty and cowardice - in Marc, who, unfortunately, is the star of this movie, and the only character who is given even the shallowest bit of depth.

If you're German, or a homophobe, or a straight married man who'd rather be gay but doesn't have the GUTS it takes to be gay - then this movie may be for you. If you're a gay man who loves being gay, watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pit-Stop/dp/B00GWWV1XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pit Stop</a>&nbsp;instead. It's fantastic, the best gay movie ever (unless you're an action addict).",1393027200,11,1706,4.892733564013841
6166535,5,B00HHYF5EI,"I agree the acting is superb and the characters are real and compelling.  I was drawn into Marc and Kay's love affair.  And the shock of it all to his wife and family rang true.  But I didn't see Marc transitioning from straight to gay.  There is a real chemistry between he and is wife.  And at the beginning,  there is no sign that Marc has any doubt about his relationship with Bettina.  He most probably has had same gender attraction.  But, as is often the case, the attraction was mild enough that he has never been moved to act on it.  It is clear he is surprised and confused by the strength of his attraction to Kay. And as the relationship develops, his growing love for Kay creates a no win situation for his most important relationships.  Just as with Brokeback Mountain,  Free Fall exposes the reality of male sexuality.  It is not binary.....straight or gay.  While some men will be attracted only to women and so the term straight truly applies to them.  And other men are attracted only to other men...so identifying as gay is accurate.  But there are untold numbers of men who will have varying degrees of same gender attraction that can also vary through out their life time.  Marc is clearly not gay.  He has an ongoing sexual relationship with his wife.  He father's a child.  But when the right guy, Kay, comes along with the right chemistry....Marc experiences a very real and very strong same gender attraction, which leads to same gender sex.  And ultimately, love.

Together,  Free Fall and Brokeback Mountain give the best portrayal of male sexuality.  Kay depicts a solid Kinsey 6.  Jack Twist in Brokeback is the 3/4 Kinsey and clearly bisexual.  Marc's character is not fully formed sexually...but he is also bisexual.  Just not clear on which side of 3 he may land.  And Ennis Delmar is a perfect Kinsey 1.  Jack Twist was a one time deal for him.  These two films offer most men the best opportunity they will ever have to learn and understand the diversity male sexuality.",1392940800,3,2004,4.597733711048159
6166536,4,B00HHYF5EI,"When I started watching this, I couldn't help but think it felt just like so many other low-budget, coming-out films. I wasn't sure I'd like it. Lo and behold, this movie was brilliantly acted. I was able to empathize with the characters, it isn't chocked full of gay stereotypes, and while there were some kissing/sexual scenes, it was apparent that his wasn't the focus of the film--the storyline was. Again, brilliantly acted, there were some very powerful scenes (some full of energy and some quite somber moments), and the ending wasn't what I expected.

Great movie overall.",1392854400,5,580,4.979381443298969

If you are like me, it is difficult to watch a movie AND try to read quickly enough to catch the facts of what is happening; especially in German.  Yes, ""emotion"" usually is more readily conveyed, but Germans typically do not overtly display their emotions, so this too is difficult (I am of German descent).  :)

Fortunately, I was able to rewatch it a couple of times to pick up the threads, but the general plot was not easily engaging for me.  Yes there are the sweet spots of tenderness and affection intermingled with the torrid times of soul-searching introspection.  I found  reasonably believable societal settings which included lovely scenery, and certainly accurately portrayed consequences of ""love mis-directed"".  I think it is deserving of some richer, more meaty plot; perhaps a sequel....",1392768000,,865,4.993006993006993

And sometimes the subtitles in this movie were hard to read because in some cases you see white lettering against a pale or bright background. But I did take German in high school and was able to follow along and understand to some degree as to what was being said and what was happening via body language. I tend to agree with other reviewers that this movie is similar to Brokeback Mountain. And I do think that sometimes this happens today in real life where some men are supposedly bisexual or can't admit that they are really gay, but can't admit it because of the morals and values they were brought up with. Sometimes there are men who are really gay, but simply follow the herd and confirm to societal norms. I have to say that both characters in this movie were very good looking and their romantic interaction with each other was pretty good! I found Kay, the one who was the gay one, to be the most attractive with his short, buzzcut haircut and scruffy face.",1392595200,2,1019,4.396825396825397

6166551,5,B00HHYF5EI,"This is a movie I absolutely enjoyed on many levels. The movie gives insights into conditioned upbringing, a clear demarcation of whats considered to be right and whats wrong but at what price? Are individual freeedom and desires to be sacrificed at the altar of such beliefs? Marc in this movie is portrayed as the traditonal guy with a great family and a girlfriend who is pregnant. Everything in his life looks okay until Kay walks in and introduces him to what can best described as a whiff of fresh air. With freedom comes responsibility and for someone like Marc this is extremely difficult. He has been taught and groomed to make everyone happy at the price of his own. So when he experiences adventure, freedom, a sense of flight and happiness with Kay, he is unable to accept it or adjust to it. Interwoven within the movie premise are societal attitudes towards homosexuality. I would have preferred a happy ending of Marc with Kay but the effort to come out of a suffocating relationship  by Marc is in itself a great step forward.

6166555,5,B00HHYF5EI,"One review I read prior to screening the film called is Brokeback Mountain revisited. I guess it is, on some levels. Both are sad, sad situations with  one character, or two, layering on poor choice on top another until there is no way out and everybody gets hurt. At least no one dies in this film, we think.

It's a film with an appealing and production value which adds value to the viewing quality. The story development and the acting are superb.
The actors are attractive, especially the blond Max, and the expressions of love and sex in every touching scene feels real. It's what happens to the characters and the reactions from their family and community that suck. It's real life and the tale could occur anywhere, and believe me, it does, repeatedly, and unfortunately, with the same very sad and depressing results.

But, don't mind me. Be entertained, as it is entertaining and much more. Hats off to the filmmaker, actors and director.
