7741613,4,B01F2F13BM,I could do with less of the friction between hosts or I would have given 5 stars,1476921600,,80,3.764705882352941
7741614,5,B01F2F13BM,"I loved this season of TG USA.  We, my son and I, love all of them . . . but they just seemed to be getting better and better.  I really do hope that there's a future for TG USA with another network, seeing as how History dumped them.  If TG USA can't continue, then I hope the guys, either together or separately forge ahead with something else awesome and car-related.",1476403200,,370,4.183098591549296

7741616,3,B01F2F13BM,"2.5 id say barely. The editior must have been changed because the camera angles, speed, and lighting was all wacked out unnessarly. The cussing edites was annoying as sin. The WORST part was the cuba episode had to stop watching it because it has bleep bleeping obama in it. Seriously id pay 3 times as much for a version without him. Wouldnt have bought it if i knew it would have a horrible person as him in it. But all the other seasons are great, way better than the Britain show.",1474329600,2,484,4.329670329670329
7741617,3,B01F2F13BM,"I have all 5 seasons on TG: US on DVD and this was probably the worst of all of them. The challenges themselves are fine, but they obviously got their hands on some slow motion cameras so felt they had to get their money's worth. The last couple seasons of TG: UK had the same problem. Stuff that would be cool to see in full speed (like Tanner flooring it into the river on the ""Rubicon Trail"" episode is only shown in slow motion). Older seasons would show it in both slow mo and full speed, usually at a different angle. It's also fully censored which is still weird since season 2 isn't censored at all and 3 and 4 are mostly censored with the occasional swear word slipping through so get ready for a LOT of annoying beeps.",1472774400,3,728,4.244604316546763

8759964,5,B01F2F13BM,"You'd never think a Comedian, a Racecar Driver, and a random Southern dude would make for such a funny show, but give them some cars, and they'll make you laugh for sure!",1527724800,,170,4.34375

8759969,5,B01F2F13BM,Program is awesome but only buy this if you want season 6.  The episodes are from season 6 not 5 and they are out of order.  It is really strange.,1488412800,,146,3.8333333333333335
