8759737,5,B01EXEKV8Y,"We discovered this show on Netflix several years ago, and my girls loved it. Then we dropped Netfilx and they were constantly begging us to watch it. Youtube has only a couple of episodes, so when we saw the DVDs for sale we had to get it for a birthday present. The show is Russian, but has been dubbed into English. There is very little dialogue in the show, so the bad lip syncing isn't really much of an issue. The show has a old-school Looney Tunes type feel, but done with modern computer animation. Because there is such little dialogue and most of the story is simply told through action, the comedy translates perfectly. The DVD packaging itself is very plain. Just a case with a cover, but what more do you really need. I highly recommend this. It's a child's show that as a parent I don't mind watching.",1521504000,,814,4.397350993377484
