7884314,4,6305149844,"This an older video of Kathy's, it is from 1989 and the music and setting may appear dated to some, neither of them have bothered me though.  The entire workout is very long, 85 minutes, but I don't think was designed to be done all at once, it is a good video to progress with as there are different levels for each part worked.  Kathy is joined by 5 exercise participants, including Lois who does the beginner version, she does not appear in the advanced sections.

The first half of the video is abs, and it is split into parts the first being the setup.  Here Kathy shows on one of her participants which muscles you will be using, and talks about important keys, like where the move originates from, correct starting position and control and pacing.  After this you go into the foundation, where you go through the step by step process of each exercise.  Some of the exercises seen in this section are traditional crunches, oblique twists, and reverse crunches or rockbacks as Kathy calls them.  At the end of this and each section there are a series of questions you ask yourself and if you answer yes to them all, then you move onto the next segment which is the workout.  Here you will see more rockbacks, modified reverse crunches, oblique twists, crunches with legs extended in the air, and you finish out with some back strengthening exercises.  More questions appear after this segment and if you answer them all with yes, then you move to the final ab segment, the challenge.  This segment includes more reverse curls but more advanced, oblique twists with legs in air, tick tocks, which are often see in some pilates ab workouts, combination crunches where you lift upper and lower abs at once, traditional crunches and an exercise where you rock back and forth that I have never seen in another video.  This concludes the ab portion.

The last half is the thighs segment, again you begin with the setup, then you move in the foundation which is in two parts.  The first part is all done on the floor.  You begin with a series of leg exercises while lying on your side.  Leg lifts with shorter lever (bent leg), some with pulsing reps and then emphasis on downward motion, clams which are another popular pilates exercise, and leg lifts with straight leg.  Then you move onto your elbow and knees and work the same leg but more hamstring and gluteals.  You start with leg lifts, some with pulsing reps, knee crosses with shootouts, hamstring curls and leg lifts with leg straight.  Each of these exercises is about 20 reps so you will really feel it.  Then you move to the other side and repeat the whole sequence on the other leg.  After this you will finish out this segment with some quadricep and inner thigh work.  Then you move to the standing portion of the foundation section.  The participants are holding onto a bar to assist with balance.  This section includes rear leg extensions with tempo variations, plie squats, pelvic tilts and squats.  After this segment you will be asked more questions, where you determine whether or not you are ready to move on to the next section, the workout.  This section includes some exercises included in the last section as well as some new ones.  You will see more rear leg lifts, then in combination with side leg lifts, traditional and one legged squats, reverse lunges, some adding a knee lift, and plie squats.  More questions will follow before you move on to the challenge.  The challenge is more high impact and some of the moves are similar to aerobic moves, those with knee issues may want to be careful here.  There are lots of hops and jumps incorporated with the moves which include lunges and plies, different variations of both.  Kathy and her exercise participants look like they are having lots of fun in this segment.  The cooldown ends the workout, where you will hear Kathy talk as a voiceover, unlike the rest of the workout.

I have never done this workout in it's entirety, it's too long, but it is good to go back to for review, etc.  Kathy is very detailed in explaining what to do and where you need to be as far as positioning goes.  There are also numerous focus tips and modifiers that pop up from time to time with helpful information, as well as reminders from Kathy herself. I find that I use the floorwork from the thighs foundation segment most often, it is a nice short floor routine that will leave your buns burning.  Kathy says that if it gets too easy you can always add ankle weights, I have yet to do that.  The only negative is there are exercises in later sections that weren't demonstrated like lunges which are an exercise that one can really hurt themselves if they don't do it properly.  All in all a good instructional video, if you have the time.  Kathy is well known for her emphasis on good form and tips, this video is no exception.  She is very pleasant in this video as well.",1130025600,8,4891,4.565366972477064
7884315,5,6305149844,"I have had this tape for many years and always get a great workout.  The instruction and queuing is thorough and accurate. Her information on form and technique is useful for all of the workouts that I do.  Many don't always have such good information.  I started out only being able to do the foundation sections and now work through all of it using ankle and wrist weights to get the ""burn"".

It is longer than most ""quick"" workouts and it is well worth the investment of time to get the results that I am looking for. The last two sections of the Thigh workout also give a nice cardio workout.",1117929600,7,596,4.342342342342342
7884316,2,6305149844,I found I did a lot of fast forwarding and rewinding on this tape.  There are way too many instructional sections of the tape that are kind of annoying if you want to get down to business and work on the stomach and thighs.  This is a very long tape and once you get past the instuctional parts is an excellant workout.  This workout would be much better on DVD if you could just jump to the parts you want instead of rewinding and fast forwarding.,1018915200,13,448,4.186046511627907
7884317,2,6305149844,"As I do with all exercise tapes I attempted to view the workout before actually doing the workout. It took me some 4 different sittings to get through this 85 MINUTE tape. That is as long as many movies! I feel that if I'm not willing to view the tape in one sitting, I surely won't commit to exercising to it, I just don't have that kind of time for only two muscle groups. Besides, both the abs and thighs can get more efficient results in less time. There are plenty of 10 minute videos out there that can deliver better results and save your valuable time. However, I do find the focus and techniques a valuable lesson to anyone who would like to fine tune their proper form. Although I do not use this tape, I do apply a few of the techniques to my other abs and thigh workouts, which has helped me bust through some workout plateaus. If you are looking for a Kathy Smith tape that will really deliver some noticable results, I would recomend the Secrets of a great upper and lower body duo. They keep me sore in much less time, and they work all the major muscle groups not just two.",995587200,21,1089,4.240384615384615
7884318,4,6305149844,"This was the first Kathy Smith tape that I ever owned.  After many years, I have discovered that Smith is one of the best teachers of technique out there.  Her lessons in form have stayed with me over the years.  The only problem that I have with this video is that it can become monotonous after a while.  But it is extremely effective; I saw results almost immediately.",977184000,12,371,4.411764705882353
7884319,5,6305149844,"I have been doing this workout for only a few weeks and I have already noticed a loss of inches around my waist and a tighter butt and firmer legs. The best part of the video is that Kathy goes over proper tecnique  extensively to help minimize injury. Also, the abs and thighs sections are  seperated into three levels for each so that you can work at your own level  and can alternate your routine. If you want a targeted routine where you can  really feel and see the results you want, this is for you.",957312000,17,505,4.229166666666667
