2983471,4,B000WM5NR6,"This movie was enjoyable,  however it focused much less on the game of soccer and much more on the family side of Munez's life.

2983495,4,B000WM5NR6,"There are not too many good soccer movies but it looks like the producers of the Goal series did a decent job developing a good story line, made if family friendly, and gave the audience a good feel for the world of pro-soccer.  Goal II picks up where Goal leave off.  There are a few edgy scenes with the girlfriend again for those with little kids but again, nothing worse than what is already on regular TV.  Have fun and be inspired to play soccer.  If you are English speaking students learning Spanish, this is a good movie to listen and learn.",1390348800,,550,4.362745098039215

2983500,3,B000WM5NR6,"The first in the series did a better job of being a self-contained movie, viable on its own if you never see any other parts of the series.  That's what a great movie does, even when it's part of a series.  I think a viewer who had not seen Goal! would be a bit lost.  The movie just stops, it doesn't really have an ending.  I think the strongest part of the movie, which is introducing Americans to the pageantry and power of European football via depiction of games, should have been played up a bit more.",1379116800,,508,4.206185567010309
2983501,2,B000WM5NR6,The movie got really boring and the whole story line of santi finding his real mom was very sopophoric. Also in the game it was very obvious what would happen.
