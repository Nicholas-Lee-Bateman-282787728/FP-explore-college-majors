8559125,5,B00AY9V3GW,"I don't often watch documentaries, let alone sports. So needless to say I wasn't too excited about watching MLB Superstars: Impact Players. It's not that I have anything against either baseball or documentaries, but the combination isn't usually my first choice. This short but sweet spotlight on some of the hottest players in the game really surprised me though. Baseball is one of my favorite sports to watch live, but usually not so much on TV. This special manages to highlight some standout players, show insightful commentary from other players and figures in the game, and best of all some great action clips. The film really had me wanted to go to a game, and even want to watch more MLB on TV to try to watch some of the superstars in the video. Unless you absolutely hate sports, watching this film will give you more interest in the game today and some of its top stars.
