2728879,5,B000MEYKDW,"As a horror flick fan, I hope After Dark makes more Horrorfest festivals. I enjoyed this film. The movie has a good story line and it was creepy. It was a lot of fun to watch.  I noticed maybe some weak issues on special effects toward the ending, but overall, it was great !!!. I am going to pre-order it . I would recommend it to the horror movie viewers that did not have a chance to see it.",1174780800,3,394,3.9873417721518987
2728880,5,B000MEYKDW,"Though I didn't get to watch any other films from horrorfest, this was the one film I made time to go see and I was not dissappointed.  As a huge horror fan I was pleased with GraverDancers.  The story line was pretty good and many of the scenes were truely scarey.  Sure there were a few weak points, but I believe the good outweighed it.  It's nice to see a scarey movie that isn't real gruesome or filled with profanities.  I already preordered it and can't wait for it to come.",1174089600,5,481,4.241758241758242
2728881,3,B000MEYKDW,"I tend to be pretty critical of films that suck.  Luckily, this ain't one of them.  I can admit that there are some issues with the film (mostly due to budgetary constraints), but overall I was very impressed with the film's premise, a couple FREAKY scenes (especially a bedroom scene with the main girl coming out the shower...you'll see it and it'll make your heart race), the performances, and the movie overall.  Pretty enteraining, and worth a view or two.",1173139200,16,461,4.7375
2728882,5,B000MEYKDW,I simply loved this film.  Saw it at Tribeca last year (2006) and fell in love.  Very imaginative.  Very scary.  Very dramatic.  This is a horror film that delivers and brings something new in the mix.  A must see.  I can't wait to own it.,1173139200,4,239,4.177777777777778
2728883,3,B000MEYKDW,This script writing is as expected and the film has interesting performances. Some moments of good technical support/fx. Viewers who enjoy the genre will enjoy this film.,1172188800,2,170,5.333333333333333
2728884,2,B000MEYKDW,"This is one of those films which draws you in with an interesting premise, some good chills, cool physical effects and then WHAM! spends the money on bad and unrealistic CGI. (WIthout too much of a spoiler:) The end should have gone in a different and much more effective direction and satisfactorily concluded them film, but no! the audience gets cheated with an ending that has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film. Did the producers re-shoot the ending? Give the company some extra bucks to pay for CGI, regardless of whether or not it was needed? If you hated the HAUNTING because of the bad CGI resolution, then stay away from this film",1171584000,12,651,4.572649572649572
2728885,5,B000MEYKDW,"i had the pleasure of watching this at horrorfest.

although, i can't see the whole too intense for general audiences, this one at least had some good scares and some great campy ideas that made for a memorable horror experience. Seems as though mike mendez is continually getting better. the acting could use some help, but the good beats out the bad. this has tons of surreal horror that just made it work great as a film and makes you jump after well built tension more than a few times.

buy it or rent it, you won't lose either way.",1170979200,2,537,4.36
2728886,5,B000MEYKDW,"i had the pleasure of traveling over an hour to see this movie and it was well worth it being 1 of 8 films that After Dark Films put together as a Horrorfest of sorts boasting that they were films that pushed the boundaries, well Gravedancers had a few moments where if it had gone through the MPAA it would have garnered a PG-13 but thankfully it did not this was a very creepy and in a couple scenes quite gory film,i didn't get the chance to see all of the films but if they're as good as Gravedancers then i can't wait until March when they'll all be released on dvd",1168732800,8,570,4.098214285714286

2728913,4,B000MEYKDW,"I have loved every movie in the After Dark Horrorfest collection. This was the first one I watched and it got me hooked. It is about a group of childhood friends who get together for a friends funeral. I won't give too much information other than this. The movie tricks you into thinking its a Drama in the first part. However, it gets scarier as it goes on and it made me jump a few times because some of the scenes were so unexpected and scary I couldn't help it. Definitely one to watch.",1434412800,,490,4.223404255319149

2728922,5,B000MEYKDW,"Slasherpool says ""this is a terrifying horror flick"" and Horrorwatch.com says this is ""the best horror film of the year"". This is about a group of people who thought they could get away with desecrating graves by dancing on them and partying in a cemetery. NEVER a good idea even in real life. The afterlife exists and has now been scientifically proven to exist in real life. It has aslo been proven that beings exist in the astral realm that do NOT like humans and are little more than wild, powerful animals. This is a story about what might happen if you anger one or some of them. To them you are a puppet or a murder or BOTH. VERY SCARY FILM.",1408665600,,648,4.319672131147541

2728924,4,B000MEYKDW,"This was everything that you'd hope for in a Saturday night horror movie. A likable, solid cast and a great script. It wasn't all out scary so much as it was fun. The ghosts have their own look, and there are a couple of really good stand out sequences. The graveyard scene and the climax are crazy fun. The Director's commentary let's you know who acted like a professional and who might have been sort of a jerk to work with.
Also includes instructions to the drinking game ""Lamp""!",1405468800,,483,4.438202247191011

2728926,4,B000MEYKDW,"At the start of this movie I was very excited because almost the first name in the credits was: Josie Maran! I don't know if you know her, but I'll never forget, she was one of my favorite Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models ever. I remember seeing her in an interview and enjoying how brash and audacious she seemed to be. I'm glad to see her here taking an entirely clothed (sigh) turn as a scream queen in this strong horror movie about a band of not-especially-likeable thirty-somethings who find an ornate card one day atop a grave. The card tells them to celebrate life and dance...so they dance on graves. And, poof, now they're haunted for a month, or at least until they can dig up the bodies and re-bury them. Oh, did I mention that the graves they danced on were in the ""undesirables"" section of the cemetery? You know, where they keep the arsonists, ax murderers, sadomasochistic sociopaths...I think you see where this is going.
I can go on about Josie Maran, but honestly her show got stolen by the beautiful Megahn Perry as the nerdy, sarcastic, skull-sneaking paranormal investigator Culpepper. She's with the Paranormal Department at Madison College, which seems to be a great department! They'll even help you dig three graves in the dead of night if you need it! All in the service of science!
Was there anything mind-blowing, challenging or innovative? Not even close, but if you're just looking for a creepy night in front of the screen, this one should do it!",1404432000,,1480,4.718146718146718
2728934,4,B000MEYKDW,good old fashioned scary fun!  A bit of gory stuff but mostly just creepy.  pretty exciting from start to finish.  I definitely recommend if you like ghost stories - the acting leaves a bit to be desired but not a deal breaker!,1404259200,,227,4.357142857142857
2728935,5,B000MEYKDW,"Love the movie, it's not a bad horror/ghost story. Also, the quality is fine. I owned this movie on DVD before, but it messed up on one scene, however, there is no problems or faults in this, plus it arrived quickly.",1400371200,,216,4.2926829268292686

2728955,5,B000MEYKDW,"Another bomb coming from The AFERDARK HORRORFEST - 8 FILMS TO DIE FOR  series. This movie has one of the best plot ever written for a horror movie, the story line involving the assailants runs very deep in history and anecdotes to come back in present time to scare you to death with amazing special effects and surprises.

An unidentified young woman, alone in a room, is attacked by an invisible assailant, who hangs her in the stairway of her house. As she dies, she drops an ornate black envelope. A year later, former college friends Sid (Marcus Thomas), Kira (Josie Maran), and Harris (Dominic Purcell) go out drinking after a funeral. They break into the Crescent View Cemetery to say their final goodbyes to the departed. Continuing their revelries, they get quite drunk. Sid finds a black envelope tucked behind a garland of flowers at the grave. It contains a poem urging those present to be joyful and to dance upon the graves. In their drunken state, the three regard this as a celebration of life, and they dance. Soon enough, mysterious things begin to happen. Harris and his wife Allison (Clare Kramer) are frightened by unexpected visions and odd sounds. Then Kira is attacked by a demonic force. She is severely bitten and sexually assaulted, and her house is ransacked. Sid is plagued by unexpected fires. They enlist a pair of paranormal investigators, Vincent Cochet (Tch&eacute;ky Karyo) and Frances Culpepper (Megahn Perry), who determine that the three inadvertently invoked a powerful curse by dancing on the graves. They are now being haunted by three wayward spirits - a passionate axe murderer, a child pyromaniac, and a serial killer and rapist - who will kill them at the next full moon. - Synopsis taken from WIKI

Our college friends will have a few hours only to find how they can end the curse before its too late....Acting is right on and gave me chills more than once. Cinematography is also perfect, colors, lights, angles...Special effects are also over the top and brought a huge smile to my face a couple times. Just the idea of the story was good enough for me! This will be hard to beat! Very scary and very effective...nothing boring here.....just pure horror entertainment!

ENJOY!!!!",1330905600,4,2227,4.852631578947369

This one is scary. The kind of scary moments that make you turn on the lights. The shower scene is probably the scariest scene in 20 years. The special effects will give you nightmares. I loved it.",1330128000,,362,4.338235294117647
2728957,5,B000MEYKDW,"I Love this movie. This, and Wicked little things, are the best 2, of the first 8 films. This can get very chilling at times, and very scary faces.

2728958,1,B000MEYKDW,"and my verdict is...look for something better to watch. The acting is horrendous. The main actor is so wooden and boring.

The plot, which could have been great, spirals towards a soap opera of drama for characters that are to boring to care about.

Special effects and make up are cheesy at best.

On flaw is one of the characters is slashed in the neck from side to side, blood spurting everywhere, but when the other characters pick her up off the floor, there is no blood on the floor.",1312675200,3,489,4.411111111111111
2728959,4,B000MEYKDW,"sure...like any ghost story, this movie calls for a suspension of disbelief. and it focuses on some really dumb people doing stupid things. i've seen these comments on other reviews of this film. and you can't argue with the truth. still, all ghost/horror movies call for these qualities to some extent. when have you ever had to watch a horror movie when you didn't find yourself yelling at the screen at least once, ""no, lady! don't open that door!"" and of course, the lady in the movie is always stupid enough to open the door.....the flick wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if she didn't.
this movie is no exception.
after a friend's funeral, three clowns who haven't seen each other since college decide to get drunk at the cemetery (which as one reviewer pointed out, does indeed have a misspelled sign)....spurred on by the most brash clown in the crowd who thinks he's cool (obligatory to all these films) and a calling card left on the grave, these drunken fools dance on the graves of people buried in the section reserved for ""undesirables"".....classic horror movie fare, as the spirits of those who have been disrespected come back to terrorize the desicraters of their graves. an interesting premise for a film like this. throw in a married guy tempted by a hot ex-lover who still wants him to give it that ""real people with real-people problems"" feel that all these flicks lean on, and the recipe grows more interesting.
there are some good scary scenes. the special effects are good. the tension and suspense grows at just the right pace. the story is told from a good viewpoint. the actors deliver a 4-star ghost movie script in believable fashion. the ghosts are evil and scary. overall, this movie delivers what a film like this is supposed to provide its audience....an entertaining, thrilling and sometimes scary ghost flick! i was entertained...with some thrills and chills along the way. i think a few of the other reviewers either don't like ghost movies or they've become over-critical and jaded by the amount of really bad flicks that are out now....and admittedly, there are a lot of bad flicks out now. this is not the greatest ghost flick ever made....but it is a very worthy 4-star ghost/horror flick with a misspelled cemetery sign, a good script and a great line-up of actors who do a wonderful job playing some really stupid characters.....in short, it's an entertaining and reasonably well-done horror flick........again, it does call for a certain suspension of disbelief, as do all flicks of this genre, but if you want reality, stay home and watch big brother on tv.
so, lighten up......celebrate life, have a few drinks and go dance on a grave. you'll be glad you did...........",1306022400,,2716,4.855603448275862

2728961,3,B000MEYKDW,"Mike Mendez follows up his gory cult-classic THE CONVENT with this supernatural shocker from beyond the grave! A group of friends are haunted by three malevolent spirits after they make the mistake of dancing on their graves in a drunken stupor the night of their friend's wake. They call in a pair of paranormal investigators to help them with their troubles, but they soon find out that they only have until the next full moon to dispel the curse, or else their souls will join those of the dead. THE GRAVEDANCERS starts off with an interesting premise and a number of solid scares, but it seems to lose itself with the introduction of Dr. Cochet and his assistant. The psychological terror is then replaced with outright horror in a number of over-the-top action sequences that act against the film's credibility. Its creepy costume designs do work in its favor, but are again a far reach from reality. Altogether, Mendez pulls together a decent mood and atmosphere that is unfortunately hampered by a weak script and questionable performances.

2728962,3,B000MEYKDW,"A couple of people recommend this film to me and I noticed some decent reviews for it.  I'm not sure if they thought it was good in comparison to some of the other After Dark Horror Fest movies or what, but I thought this was a snooze fest.

I'll admit to not being the biggest fan of ghost stories, at least when it comes to movies.  I was willing to give this one a chance because the premise sounded interesting enough.  Almost like a Christmas Carol with a horror twist on it.  My main problem with the movie was the fact that the ghosts weren't all that interesting, aside from the rapist priest.  The majority of the time the victims would just be tossed around or beat up by the ghosts....not quite scary.  I also didn't like the fact that the ghosts faces looked too much like masks.  They were creepy looking, but also very ""fake"" looking as well.

Overall the movie really didn't do much for me.  The characters were kind of annoying, so I didn't really care what fate had in store for them.  The scares were also pretty minimal.  I'd recommend this as a $1 rental if you're bored one day or are intent on seeing all the After Dark films.  Go check out ""Borderlands"" or ""Frontiers"" instead, they show off what the After Dark Horror Fest series really has to offer.",1284854400,,1274,4.370212765957447

2728974,4,B000MEYKDW,"The Gravedancers is an original and frequently scary horror tale about a group of friends set upon by three vengeful spirits awakened after the friends danced on their graves.  Okay, after 'a night of drunken gravedancing', as the back of the DVD case puts it - sounds like it has potential but also sounds pretty campy, right?  Well, it turns out there's a bit more to it than that.

  The formerly close friends had drifted apart over the last few years, but were drawn back together for the funeral of another member of their old clique.  Their reunion brings back all the old feelings - the torches still carried in some cases, and all the memories of their good times together, and all the questions of why they ever let each other drift apart.  In the middle of the night, the trio makes its way to the grave of their recently deceased friend with a bottle of wine to toast their friend and the old times.  As the night goes on, they reminisce and drink too much and end up wanting to celebrate life and their friend's memory, and that's why they end up dancing, even though they're aware it's a rather bizarre place for a celebration-of-life.

  In the days following the midnight celebration, strange and terrible things begin happening, and when the group is desperate enough to seek the help of a team of paranormal investigators, the 'dance in the cemetary' thing comes up, and the researchers are immediately horrified, as this is said to have the potential to anger and awaken old spirits.  It gets even worse, though.  On a trip back to that graveyard, it's discovered that their friend was buried in a part of the cemetary close to an old, long unused portion of the graveyard that the trio wandered onto in their dances - a section from decades ago that had been reserved for the burial of the worst criminals and psychopaths in the community, ones that nobody wanted buried alongside their own loved ones.  And it's these human monsters that have come back, and have to somehow be exorcised quickly, as the longer the full cycle of the moon goes on, the stronger the spirits become.

  The movie plays itself seriously and successfully, and the occasional moments of humor work surprisingly well but don't detract from the overall dark tone.  Fine acting job all around; the most well-known member of the cast is supermodel Josie Maran who turns out to have a lot of acting talent (it makes me wonder why she's had so few movie roles).  Josie plays Kira, one of the three 'gravedancers', the other two are played by Dominic Purcell (Harris) and Marcus Thomas (Sid); Harris's wife Allison (Clare Kramer) also finds herself haunted by one of the specters.  The ghosts are abominable, sadistic creatures, and the visual appearance of one in particular are utterly ghastly.  The special effects at the climax of the movie, with bigger, bolder supernatural happenings, aren't as strong, but that one ghost - hideously creepy and realistic.

  Very intense and frightful, definately recommended for fellow horror fans.",1257552000,,3029,4.769673704414587

2728977,5,B000MEYKDW,"Of the original After Dark Horrorfest films, only two of the eight were any good in my opinion. Those two were Unrest and The Gravedancers.

Although a lifelong horror movie fan, I don't recall anyone using this particular plotline before. Dancing on graves makes the spirits furious? It's so intuitive, but somehow, either no one else picked up on it, or I just missed those movies. The way the writers handled this story was fantastic! The movie started slow, but once the three had committed the offense, the pace picked up VERY quickly. Everything moved in a pretty fluid manner with some genuine scares along the way. The actors were great in their roles and their reactions were believable. Good dialogue too. The CG was a bit crappy at times, especially when we saw the kid at the climax, but the special effects in other areas made up for that.

I have many criteria for what makes a good horror movie. Besides the usual acting/dialogue/pacing/effects/scares, I also look at two other things. If I end the film going ""That was awesome! I want to see it again!"", then that is a high mark. If I end it announcing ""I'm going to have to buy this DVD!"", that's the highest mark. And if I can watch it multiple times and see some different nuance each time, then I am totally sold on the film. All three of those criteria were met with this film. I saw it, had to own it, and I get something new from it with each viewing. This is one of the favorites in my collection.",1240876800,16,1471,4.4646840148698885
2728978,3,B000MEYKDW,"THE GRAVEDANCERS

I was a bit surprised way back when I bought this and finally sat down to watch it, compared to the previous ones I had seen this one wasn't that bad. I have come to find that most of the films in this series are decent while only a few are really good. This one falls kinda in between as it is just good not real good but good none the less. It is actually very creative because the story line I find really intriguing. Imagine saying good bye to a friend and in the process unleashing evil spirits upon you by dancing on their graves, sounds like a good time. That is exactly what happens here and other then a few missteps this is a pretty good flick that I found entertaining.

The movie follows three friends who come together once again for the funeral of a friend; two make it there the other stays away. That is until later that night when he makes the suggestion that they go to the cemetery that night for one last good bye to their departed friend. At first the disagree but soon they all make their way there and happen upon a note, a note that says they should dance, and dance they do. Each grooves on top of one grave each it seems, thus unleashing whom ever it was they were on top of upon them.

This movie really feels like a really good made for TV movie to me, I think because of the way it was shot [especially the opening credit sequence at the cemetery]. Writers Brad Keene and Chris Skinner did a good enough job with this film since the idea behind the movie is actually pretty cool; I think the budget was the biggest enemy of this movie. Director Mike Mendez seems like he could make a really good flick if he had a better budget, this is apparent in the last third of the film. The best example of this is the Ghostbusters style large ghost head chasing the car; once again the budget must be to blame. Also the ghost of the wife beater guy I believe it is looks like an anorexic Pumpkinhead, kinda cool. But aside from that this is a pretty decent flick.

Acting wise I think the entire cast did well enough and pulled of believable enough performances. Dominic Purcell, Josie Maran, Clare Kramer, Marcus Thomas, and all the rest of the cast do good jobs on this film and pull out some believable performances even when the effects are not as good. Even the ghost's are cool in this one, one is a little fire starter maniac while another is a vicious wife beater. Then of course there is the crazy lady bent on cutting you up, or at least in that scene she was.  All of them were cool and the actor played well off of the idea of these spirits. Of course like I said not all the special effects were so good, but that is a budget thing I assume.

Over all this is a worthy addition to the series and may be one of the best over all. Still it falls a little short of classic status even though it is original. I guess it will be a while before I dance on graves again, man that used to be so fun.",1239926400,,2942,4.161687170474517

2729005,1,B000MEYKDW,"The Gravedancers (Mike Mendez, 2006)

When a movie starts out with the name of the cemetery misspelled, you know you're in big trouble. Well, it doesn't actually start out that way, per se; there's an opening scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. So now you have two indications that you're in big trouble. Add in that this was one of the films from the much-vaunted and entirely underwhelming After Dark Horrorfest, and, well, strike three, you're out.

The Gravedancers is about three idiots who reunite after some time apart at the wake of a fourth idiot who was one of their college buddies. The three idiots in question are Harris (Prison Break's Dominic Purcell), who's now married to the somewhat shrewish Allison Mitchell (Clare Kramer, recently of The Skulls III); Kira (Van Helsing's Josie Maran, who will probably be best remembered as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars), with whom Harris shares a tumultuous past affair (about which Allison knows); and Sid (Edmond's Marcus Thomas), who just doesn't know when to keep his big trap shut. After the wake, the three of them head out to the graveyard, get drunk, and dance on graves. As if this isn't muddleheaded enough, they happen to be in the section of the cemetery that houses undesirables, and they scare up three really, really nasty ghosts. To help with their haunting problem, they turn to parapsychologist Vincent Cochet (Tcheky Karyo, easily the best thing about this movie) and his perky, yet mysterious, assistant Culpepper (Megahn Perry). From there, it's special effects central, of course.

As with the rest of the After Dark movies, this one has about as many scares as your freezer (if you keep it clean). To add to the fun, this one also has some really terrible acting (many folks have already pointed out how unintentionally hilarious Marcus Thomas is throughout the film; his acting even occasioned an entire thread in the movie's IMDB forum), bargain-basement special effects in the movie's climax, and a script that went as far as it possibly could in both clich&eacute; and predictability.

It's about three young adults who decide to go out to a graveyard one night and party near the graves (after one of the friends does a really bad job of convincing the other two why they should do that).  While out there, one of the guys finds a letter located near a grave that has a poem written on it.  Apparently reading the poem triggers three different ghosts to appear and haunt the people who've disturbed them from their resting place.

A few weeks later, strange things start to happen to each of the three people who were partying on the graves that one night.  Strange noises can be heard in the homes, such as whispering sounds, and pianos playing by themselves.  The three friends believe they are imagining the strange events, but that turns out NOT to be the case.  Eventually ghost images begin to appear and disturb the friends to the point where they search for some help.  This is where the movie reallys starts to pick up.

The first 15 to 20 minutes was rather average with uninteresting and rushed character development, but if you give the movie a chance, eventually it will build into a very suspenseful story with lots of exciting special effects and loud scares to delight fans of horror movies everywhere.

What makes the movie so great is the way the suspense builds to the point where the ghosts become absolutely ticked off and aren't afraid to hold back their extreme anger no matter what.

Its a simple story and well executed on a low budget; given a higher budget I think they could have done a Demonically great job since the ideas are there. Also, the roles show enough material for a trilogy, but listen to the commentary, and you can discover why it did not get that far.

Sadly, it suffers from what I like to call HOHH Disease. For those unfamiliar with HOHH Disease, or House on Haunted Hill Disease, it's an affliction in which a film with great promise for creepiness, chills and thrills displayed in the first half, dissolves into a completely scareless and overblown CGI mess in the second. So if you don't mind having your horror dreams crushed in the second act, this film is worth a viewing. Now, to address another reviewer who called Penny Dreadful a ""semi-classic"", all I have to say it let the name speak for itself. There wasn't an original, uncliched moment in the entire film. It's only distinguishing feature is that about 65 minutes of the 80 some odd minutes of the film takes place inside a car that's wedged between two trees. And no, I'm not kidding. I spent the majority of the film giggling at the dialogue, rolling my eyes, sighing loudly in boredom, looking around the theatre to watch other viewers' reactions (all of whom looked either completely amused, bored, annoyed, or somehow all three at once), and staring at my watch.

2729027,4,B000MEYKDW,"The Gravedancers is part of the After Dark Horrorfest, One of the ""8 Films to Die For"" as the tag line boasts. Three friends come together for the funeral of another friend who died in a car accident. In ""Big Chill"" fashion, the characters have unresolved feelings for each other. Kira (Josie Maran) is still in love with Harris (Dominic Purcell of TV's Prison Break) and his wife Allison (Clare Kramer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is none to happy about it. Meanwhile, loser friend Sid (Marcus Thomas) has loved Kira in secret for years, fearing being rejected.

The trio gathers at night in the cemetery to toast their friend one last time and it soon turns to drunken revelry with music and dancing...dancing on graves. Days after, they all begin to experience strange phenomena: strange sounds, doors opening and closing, a piano playing by itself, etc...Some get it worse than others as Harris and Allison find Kara curled up into a fetal position in her home, apparently the victim of a beating and sexual assault. But this was no human predator. Their ill-advised grave dancing has unleashed a trio of vengeful spirits who want no less than to kill the ones who desecrated their graves. They seek aid from a pair of university paranormal investigators Vincent (Tcheky Karyo) and his assistant Culpepper (Meghan Perry). It seems the area of the cemetery they danced in was reserved for criminals. The graves belonged to a sadistic sexual predator, and axe murderess, and a young pyromaniac. They discover the incantation of the Gravedancer that says the spirits have from full moon to full moon to kill them. But as the end of the cycle draws near, the ghosts become more and more powerful.

Gravedancers is an old-style ghost film that relies on building suspense and atmosphere as opposed to relying on high-end CGI graphics. In many ways it reminds me of he 80's film ""Ghost Story"" although the pace isn't quite as slow. Director Mike Mendez doesn't give in by trying to show the ghosts too soon. He lets the tension build up to what is a frantic pace in the film's final 15 minutes. There are a handful of genuine leap out of your seat moments in the film, particularly when Harris wakes up to a surprise in bed.

The performances in Gravedancers is a bit uneven. Purcell, Kramer (who played the Goddess Glory in Buffy) and Karyo all do a good job and obviously show their experience as seasoned performers. The same can't be said for Marcus Thomas who delivers his lines with all the zeal of a chicken salad sandwich. He's stiff and lifeless and his performance alone drags the picture down a notch or two.

Gravedancers is an effective ghost story, subtle, and often suspenseful. A solid film and a great DVD package with lots of extras.

The DVD is presented in widescreen format and runs 96 minutes. The package is loaded with some very good extras including a commentary by Mendez, a Making-of Featurette, a Making the Ghosts featurette, deleted scenes, storyboard galleries, and trailers

Three friends decide to party on a grave site where one of their friends was just buried. This is where the fun begins! They are tormented every waking hour with ghouly faces and loud noises.

Fast forward about a hour and twenty five minutes into the movie and you will see a scene where a guy is wrestling with a ghost, his wife, who has no idea where in the house her husband is located, busts through the wall driving a Hummer and runs over the ghost.  Yeah I just typed that a ghost got run over by a Hummer.  Oh wait it gets better.  The ghost then transforms into a huge head and head-butts (I don't know what else you would call it) the Hummer as they drive stupidly away from it. No real violence to offset the retarded, and childish effects, which could have been made 15 years ago.  The ghost by the way are Bug - Eyed (and incapable of blinking, as if the actors where wearing really, really cheap masks) wrinkly people with huge teeth.  If I were dumb, drunk, stoned and mentally challenged, I would enjoy this movie almost as much as a jog through traffic.

2729031,2,B000MEYKDW,"The series of films carried under the After Dark Horrorfest all appear to be loaded with serious potential, and The Gravedancers is no different.  Prison Break's Dominic Purcell and hottie Josie Maran play old friends who fall under a curse after a night of drinking and dancing in a cemetery following a friend's funeral.  Soon enough, Purcell and his wife (Clare Kramer, better known as the villainous Glory from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), along with others, are violently haunted and stalked; all of which appears to be leading somewhere good, but finishing up with a non-sensical story, and an incredibly underwhelming ending that betrays everything that was set up before it.  There's isn't a whole lot of blood and gore to be found here, but the moody atmosphere and creepy, suspenseful direction works well for the first third of the film, but sadly, everything ends up falling apart.  It's sad because The Gravedancers starts out so good and it ultimately fails as it goes nowhere.  It's worth checking out though for horror fans to be sure (you could always certainly do much, much worse), but all in all, The Gravedancers is one of the more disappointing films in the After Dark Horrorfest series.",1186790400,12,1207,4.926108374384237

Although it kept my interest, I still can't figure out why its too gruesome for general audience...",1186358400,,222,4.162790697674419
2729033,2,B000MEYKDW,"I've been looking forward to checking out some of the ""After Dark Horrorfest"" films for a while now but only recently had the opportunity to rent ""The Gravedancers"".  Honestly it only wound up in my hands because Blockbuster was out of ""Wicked Little Things"" and ""Unrest"".  Nonetheless, I sat down to watch the film with great anticipation because I had heard positive things about it.

The set up for the film is somewhat convoluted, in that a group of pals decide to have a party in the graveyard after a mutual friend's funeral, only to discover a bereavement card on his grave that contains a strange rhyme.  After reading the rhyme they feel compelled to dance on the graves (hence the title), which naturally irks some of the cemetery's less pleasant denizens.  From this intro through the next 20-30 minutes ""Gravedancers"" is actually pretty creepy, as the film initially plays the scares at a slow and moody pace.  There were a couple of scenes that honestly gave me the willies, and by the half hour mark I was beginning to think that I'd found a hidden gem.

Sadly, the film goes steadily down hill from this point, complete with a schizophrenic shift in tone from a brooding supernatural chillfest into a goofy, poorly executed mess.  Part of this has to do with the introduction of the deus ex machina parapsychologists who are in the film largely to explain the ""rules"" of how to defeat the ghosts.  Sadly, they occupy way too much screen time and one of them has a phony French accent that would have been more at home in a Monty Python film.  Furthermore, the ""rules"" don't make sense.  Try this one on for size (I'm paraphrasing and giving away a bit of plot here): ""You disturbed these ghosts by dancing on their graves, and the only way to placate the spirits is to dig up their skeletonized corpses, toss them in burlap sacks, and rebury them in my yard.""  You'd think that would get the undead even more cheesed off...

Honestly the shift in tone and the abandonment of the suspense in favor of slasher flick scares is the most frustrating part about this film.  The first act is good.  Had the rest of the film managed to keep it up, this movie would have easily gotten four stars.  Alas, the movie not only plateaus but nosedives into silliness in the final act.  If you saw a clip from the beginning of the film and then watched the last 10 minutes, you would think that they were from different movies.

The acting in this movie is pretty good, especially considering what kind of film it is, but the two parapsychologists are, plainly put, lame.  They end up being pretty distracting and show up fairly late in the film while still managing to take up too much screen time.  There's also an unrequited love subplot that doesn't need to be there, but thankfully it's so tacked on and only briefly alluded to that you might miss it anyway.  (Honestly, did they switch writers at some point or something...?)

My only other minor gripe is that the director has elected to use some weird editing in places, such as shortening a scene of a room being searched by leaving the camera in one place but jumping from 2-second clip to 2-second clip of the actress going through drawers, closets, etc.  It's hard to describe in text, but trust me, you'll know it when you see it.  I honestly thought the disc was damaged the first time it happened.

Overall this film is -decent-.  It probably deserves about 2 1/2 stars rather than just 2. There are some scary parts, mostly clustered around the beginning, but the second and third acts are increasingly weak and the ending is almost laughable.  I would strongly recommend renting this one before you lay down your money for it.  I'm glad I did.",1185321600,3,3709,4.587253414264036

The premise had so much potential to be a really scary flick, but turned out to be such the opposite.  It started out with some creepy moments but quickly got off track and turned into a typical corny horror movie.  One thing I will give it was the creatures in the movie were pretty freaky looking, but it just wasn't enough.

Anyway, Gravedancers should be given a chance.  The idea is pretty good and the cast does a pretty good job in a low budget picture.  Clare Kramer excels in this film, even though she is not actually one of the intended victims of the ramaging spirits.  The special effects at the end do take away a little from the entire effect of the movie, but it still delivers beyond the level that I expected it to.  I think if you view this one with reasonable expectations you will not be disapointed.  If you start to watch it thinking this is actually a movie to die for, you will be unsatisfied.

2729046,3,B000MEYKDW,"Last November, a hefty marketing campaign was launched at targeting horror film fans.  Specifically, the ""HORRORFEST 8 FILMS TO DIE FOR"" campaign, which purported to distribute horror films whose content was allegedly so extreme, that their releases had been hampered for general audiences.  The marketing campaign was creative but not a wholly underivative concept.  Back in 1999, the advertising for the quasi-pseudo documentary ""The Blair Witch Project"" had grabbed national attention and even blurred some people's understanding of whether the subject was fictitious or an overlooked and obscure local incident of supernatural phenomenon.  This may have been one of the most brilliant and effective advertising campaigns for a film which was itself remarkably unremarkable.  In fact, this ""crockumentary"" was not a scary film or even a very good one.  It made a lot of money and pissed off a large number of people who felt ripped off or mislead.  Not surprisingly (though perhaps wisely), the `makers' of ""The Blair Witch Project"" had pretty much dropped out of sight and mind after their whirlwind of publicity; in effect, they made their money and skedaddled (which was fine with me). Although according to IMDB, they are again directing films after a 6 or 7 year absence.

Now where was I?  Oh, yeah... the 8 HORROFEST FILMS TO DIE FOR BLAHBLAHBLAH:  an effective series of commercials which used a montage of trailer scenes and haunting noises and eerie narration which was broadcast in fairly heavy rotation.  The clips were skillfully put together as to feature abridged footage briefly enough to be intriguing yet remain slightly ambiguous.  The foreboding narrative claims seemed believable, and in combination with a pretty decent website and an imaginative touring itinerary where certain films were available in certain cities on certain days, many people no doubt believed they had unfettered access to a collection of cinematic taboo.  However, many of us pretty much figured out what was going on and what would be the end product (and reaction).

The truth is that these films were not really any more graphic or violent or scary than the films which were getting distribution through Theater or Straight-to-Rental releases.  Granted, these were better-made films than many or most of the marginal work that can be found in the latter S-t-R category, but ironically some lesser films actually have more explicit content as a way of trying to make themselves more marketable and to compensate for their lack of production values.  The resulting opinions about the films of this collection, according to the customer reviews and other forms of feedback, have not been overwhelming favorable.

Hard-core horror fans have 2 things (psychology notwithstanding) which makes them a difficult demographic to impress:  The first is a fairly high capacity for gore and violent content; the second is an increasing gradient of expectations.  These contribute to a rather challenging threshold for terror and fright, which most of the time is not satisfied.  Among the featured films of the package, there were stratifications between the stronger films and the less impressive efforts. Where preferences began to form depended as much on the individual audience member's own psyche and the visual effects proficiency, according as the film's budget production values.

Of the films in this highly touted but ambivalently received batch, THE GRAVEDANCERS tends to be regarded as one of the better films (or less vilified films, if you prefer).  To its credit, THE GRAVEDANCERS has the strongest (or most recognizable) cast which features Dominic Purcell (BLADE 3: TRINITY, and the TV series PRISON BREAK), Tcheky Karyo (THE PATRIOT, and THE CORE), and the very lovely Josie Maran.  Purcell is not an especially strong actor (but the Mrs. really likes him, so it allows me more latitude in my admiration for beautiful actresses, some of whom are occasionally naked, though not really in this film).  This movie also has the most intriguing and creative storyline plot of the group, whereby drunken revelry following a friend's funeral leads to dancing on the graves of 3 particularly malevolent spirits, provoking their supernatural ire (see, the Baptists were right all along about drinking and dancing).  As a result, the trio of friends are plagued by terrible (and occasionally violent) encounters and visitations from these spirits, which are revealed to be from an underage serial arsonist, a jilted mistress-turned-axe murderer, and a brutal rapist/killer.  Eventually, the friends come across an `expert' of sorts (Karyo) who informs them of the nature of their ghostly dilemma.

From there, the protagonists efforts to resolve this supernatural quandary contains one minor twist but is otherwise fairly easy to follow (if not predict).  The acting is mediocre overall (subpar in some cases), and the special effects were light, although the evil spirits were somewhat spooky and even startling.  The film isn't bad, but it is danger of disappointment via the very same marketing strategy (overhype and oversensationalizing) that made it so recognizable more than it likely would have been being released on its own.  That's the trade-off Lionsgate was willing to make between increased revenues versus audience satisfaction.

2729050,3,B000MEYKDW,"I have been slowly working through the Horrorfest DVDs, and I have been pretty negative about them so far, but this one was really keeping my interest through most of it.  Perhaps it was the getting away from the usual youngsters-who-must-die formula, with a crew of foolish ones who are still young, but a bit more professional this time around.  Three old chums meet up at a funeral for another friend and end up on a drunken binge in a graveyard.  When one of them finds a mysterious card which details how one may dance on the graves of the dead to celebrate life, the three get dancing, and the problems ensue from there.  Of course, there is already some intrigue, in that Harrison and Kira have a little thing going between them, even though Harrison is married, and Harrison's wife is the first to notice odd things going on around the home a week or so after the dancing episode.

The danced-upon graves, of course, turn out to be the graves of psychos and other dangerous types--a murdering mistress, a rapist/serial killer, and a pyromaniac child--and they are not happy with having their resting places disturbed.  And, of course, parapsychologists eventually get involved to help quiet these angered spirits...if they really know what they're doing.  This film is light on gore, but it's good on the creep factor.  There are some well done ghostly appearances reminiscent of Asian horror, and the ghosts themselves are nicely spooky at first.  Tensions mount in the friends' relationships, which make them only more susceptible to the ghosts' attacks.  I was enjoying the film, for the most part, until about the 90-minute mark....

...and then it all fell apart.  There are really some lousy moments to try to seal the movie up.  The effects, which had previously been pretty simple, get overdone and laughable, almost as though the director saved 90% of the budget for the final sequence.  But this sudden barrage of cgi and special effects ruins the movie's otherwise quiet, creepy feel.  Even worse, the script makes some predictable and unimaginative moves.  Characters are suddenly alive when previously thought dead, and characters who had previously been a little weak suddenly become Rambo-esque.  Even the ""The End...or Is It?"" move to maintain the possibility for Gravedancers II makes this one a Cloned Movie to Die For: a movie that wasn't too intense for theaters--just too hackneyed.",1179360000,3,2411,4.942928039702233

It's got a little gore, a little violence, a little plot (always a plus) and as little CGI as possible.  There is almost no sexual content, however.  Some might see this as a good thing.

2729068,5,B000MEYKDW,"The Afterdark Horrorfest, 8 films to die for? I wouldn't go that far. I find it hard to believe that some of these eight films were too graphic to show in movie theatres.

Gravedancers is a pretty cool ghost story horror film, sure if you read some of my other horror reviews, I do like a good gory film.  This time the gore is minimal but the scares are great and the story is creepy.

In this film 3 friends come together at a friends funeral and find themselves at his grave sight to send him of their own way. But when one finds a mysterious poem left on his gravestone and then reads it, followed by the three of them dancing on the graves. Well they just sealed their fate.  The spirits of the bodies buried at those grave sights haunt each one of them.

This story escaltes from brooding and somber to an all out fright fest that kinda makes Poltergiest look like a bedtime story(don't get me wrong, Poltergiest was pretty creepy). The events that scare you in this film go from scary to scarier. The Ghost manifestations are creepy and frightening.  This film also goes into the poltergiest direction when the characters turn to a group that specializes in paranormal activity, and a little bit of pagan lore.  The paranormal group helps investigates and helps them try to get rid of the spirits before the whole thing climaxes on the next full moon. Three friends, three ghosts, the hauntings are specific that are destined to end with the death of each character.

There are a few cool suprises in this film along with a little bit of gore, but not much.

Although I gave this movie five stars I must admit the Cgi in this film was good but not great, I don't think that it took away from this film too much as most of the special effects were not cgi driven.

DVD extras include 2  making of featurettes, deleted scenes, original trailer, and of course director commentary.

Bottom Line.......Awesome, I would've gone to see this in a theatre. Great film to watch late night with the lights out.",1177804800,4,2006,4.480769230769231
2729069,4,B000MEYKDW,"First of all, GRAVEDANCERS had the incredible common sense to cast one of my favorite girls: JOSIE MARAN. No, she's a less than average actress but she's getting better. I just like her personality and she has some tough scenes in this, including some stunts (THAT SHE DID DO) and some personality shifts, which she handled expertly.

GRAVEDANCERS is actually a horror movie that I would reference a few years down the road. I turned the sound up, turned the lights out and actually was wide-eyed a few times. Most noteably when the ghost of the homicidal jilted wife started to make her presence known.

Also, the effects were really well done for a low budget film. The ghosts were frightening and scary. So, the key word here is low budget film. I don't necessarily think that the movie had a cheap look to it, but I was SHOCKED at the lack of polishing done to the SCREENPLAY.

First of all, the premise of film centers around GRAVEDANCING. That's fine... but the way the gravedancing happened was very very very UNauthentic, staged and sort of chessy. There were so many ways to do the scene, but they chose to move the scene along with dialogue that was so OBVIOUS and it didn't have to be.

""Here... dance with me here on this grave!""

That scene happened early in the film and it left a bad taste in my mouth for a few minutes. It didn't have to be so staged. They could have just danced. It didn't have to be so choreographed and obvious. Fortunately, there was some really well done scary scenes in the film and you forget that glaring blemish of a scene fairly quickly.

There were other incidents of badly staged and badly used dialogue, but that scene was the biggest annoyance to me. Otherwise, I loved GRAVEDANCERS and would watch it again and again. It was scary and memorable and you say that so rarely these days when it comes to horror movies. Most are PG-13 and not scary. GRAVEDANCERS is frightening.

Aside from a well executed scare scene involving one character sleeping and the other comming out of the shower, this movie was flat and a little boring. The acting was ranged from dreadful to mildly serviceable but good acting wouldn't have mattered much paired with a script such as this. Do not get me wrong, the premise is pretty wicked and when things start going south for the grave desicrating perpetrators it is pretty creepy. But when a ghost hunting duo enters the mix, it goes from bad to worse in seconds flat, most evidently when one of them does a selfish act that pretty much seals the fate of everyone else. The only one murder scene was really gory, while the others seemed a little off. A scene in the hospital was way off base with the reactions of onlookers overshadowing the onslaught occuring in the other room. Many of the characters are stupid in this movie... and in typical horror fashion, do one thing when they should so obviously do another. Still, all critical views aside, this film isn't a complete waste... and it isn't the most aweful horror film I've ever seen... it is just a little bland. With a headliner like ""After Dark horror Fest: Eight movies to Die For"" I kind of expected a little more bang for my buck...",1175644800,8,1457,4.5437262357414445

I will say this:it is better than ""Penny Dreadful"", in the long haul, although PD had a more exciting ending. This is kind of original,in that the plot will not be recognizable to most horror fans, so I would like to give it a 2.75.

There isn't much to say about this film except do not buy it, rent it when  the rental store is out of stock of them movie you really wanted to see.

The question with ""The Gravedancers"" is whether or not we are suposed to be taking this whole thing seriously, because the more you treat this film as a roller coaster ride and not as an attempt to provide a film ""whose content is considered to graphic, too distrubing, and too shocking for general audiences,"" the more you are going to like it.

As you might expect the story begins in a graveyard where brooding laywer Harris McKay (Purcell), sexy Kira Hasting (Josie Maran), and wiseass Sid Vance (Marcus Thomas) have come to bury an old friend.  They decide to drown their sorrows by getting wasted in the cemetery that night and they find a card bearing a strange incantation.  If they do not read it or just throw the card away the movie would be over at this point, but where is the fun in that I ask you?  So Harris and Kira, who had been a couple when they were all younger, engage in the titular activity while Sid decides to double down and not only gravedance but also urinate on a tombstone.  When they start getting haunted, each in their own way and in their own homes, they try to find out what is going on and it turns out they picked the wrong graves to dance on, namely a piano teacher with an ax, a child pyromaniac, and a judge who was into S&M (the ""Good Riddance"" on one of the tombs should have been a clue).

This is a fairly interesting premise, especially to somebody like me who feels bad walking across a grave, and I like the way the deadly ghosts are all different and all have their own little back stories that indicate each could have carried a horror film on their own.  Caught up in all the fun is Allison (Kramer), who is married to Harris and who is not thinking about supernatural spirits but jumping to the conclusion that Kira wants to get back with her husband.  Explaining the unexplainable is the paranormal expert Vincent (Karyo) and his sassy assistant Culpepper (Megahn Perry), who are interested in proving that these hauntings are actually happening but then end up trying to stay alive with the others as the ghosts show up for a tag-team match at the old mansion that houses their institute.

The climax of a horror film is always the hardest part to carry off and most set ups never receive the payoff you desire.  But part of my problem with ""The Gravedancers"" is that it followed ""Dark Ride"" in the order that I saw the ""8 Files 2 Die 4,"" and since we have laughed ourselves silly at the end of that film when the heroine drives a large vehicle through the wall at the exact right place at the exact right time, seeing something quite similar in this movie derailed things.  That and the something stupid somebody dies that makes things worse at the absolute wrong time.  This is where I started wondering if the whole idea was just to provide a roller coaster ride instead of really getting us emotionally and intellectually involved (i.e., the endgame of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poltergeist/dp/0792833201/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Poltergeist""</a>).  A horror film that can come up with an endgame that shocks you, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Odishon-Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Odishon"" (""Audition"")</a>, or surprises you, like the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Saw""</a>&nbsp;is really going to stand out.

Director Mike Mendez made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Convent/dp/B00005QJIF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Convent""</a>&nbsp;back in 2000, and ""The Gravediggers"" is clearly an attempt to try and move into the mainstream, so ending up as part of Horrorfest 2006 must really be a half-empty/half-full result for him.  There are lots of things in this movie you have to be willing to go along with, beginning with the fact these poor fools are literally invited to desecrate these graves by dancing on them, to the whole bit with the head at the end.  The more horror films you watch, the more references (nee homages) to other movies you will see here, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But even if there are not outright scares there are some rather haunting images and I like the way that Harris cross-examines the experts pretty much every time they make a suggestion.  You have to love the irony that an engraved invitation gets this guy to dance on a grave but he is skeptical of expert testimony.",1175212800,,5901,6.011918951132301
2729095,5,B000MEYKDW,"This movie out of all 8 was BY FAR the best.  Yep, I saw 'em all, and will have to say, this one topped 'em.  This movie was great because it definitely had the ""cover your eyes"" moments (which is what makes a ""scary"" movie scary) as well as a bit of gore (for the morbid at heart, kinda like myself...lol).  Best of both worlds if you're into both.  I know I am, so I was in pure happiness watching this movie.

My pre-ordered copy should be delivered today or tomorrow and I CAN'T WAIT to watch it again and share it with my family and friends who didn't get a chance to see it.  SCARY!  Highly recommended.

2729096,3,B000MEYKDW,"I bought this movie because I really enjoyed some of the stills of the neat way the ghosts look.  I then started watching it....  All actors are fairly decent except for the guy who plays the Oafish friend.... he is god aweful.  It then starts as a typical cursed by ghosts, ghost story.  The sound design all around for this is actually excellent.  Reminded me a lot in the beginning of the original House on Haunted hill where they use lighting and sound to create a mood.... Was really starting to like it.... then they start using really cheap looking effects.  You can do alot with cheap effects using the afformentioned sound and lighting but these just looked horrible.... and not in the Evil Dead (pseudo-comedy awesome sort of way).  One effect of a small ghost was so obviously a latex mask it was laughable.  If you watch the extras where the director talks about making the ghosts... they only did up to two revisions max of the ghosts and the macettes (sp) were actually much cooler then the final products (They really screwed up the finals with the eyes).

The ending was so horrible and went in a terribly cheesy direction...(slight spoiler alert) including slam dunking skulls with cheesy catch phrases.  Watch it for it's cheese factor, but don't let the beginning actual dark horror movie atmosphere lead you to believe it will remain that way.

BTW... has anyone else noticed how much one of the Ghosts rips off Aphex Twin's Come To Daddy Video (done 10 years ago!  And much creepier to boot)",1175040000,11,1512,4.664150943396226

8168149,2,B000MEYKDW,"So I got hooked on the theme - the individual peril of disrespecting the dead.  A chilling opener gets things started.  And then... there is virtually no decent acting here - even the cat seems off.  You'd get better performances at a corporate finance meeting.  It creates a genuine distance.  I really didn't care about any of the characters.  Secondly, the writing was uneven at best and fraudulent at worst.  When it focuses on the theme, the film becomes clearer and realer.  When it builds up idiotic scenarios - marital infidelity, scientific conspiracy - it falters badly.  How exactly do two police officers - guns aimed - show up at your door when your non-networked alarm goes off?  Think about it.  And as far as directing and editing go, it really doesn't seem there was any or there would be retakes and rewrites.  Production values are beneath those of a rodeo clown.  I was laughing as the film came to a climax - the effects were awful.  Still, the film had promise and, here and there, fulfilled it.  The theme is compelling and I hope some visionary producer or some such other dusts this film off and gives it a proper treatment.  I guess it's worth an SD rental if you are so inclined.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But tell me how.",1490832000,,1242,4.542986425339366
