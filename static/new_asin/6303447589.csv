644634,2,6303447589,"I like Wesley Snipes and usually enjoy his flicks, with that said I have to say this one was bad. Silly, dumb story that
started out good but quickly went downhill. The visuals of skydiving were great (which is why I gave two stars instead of one), but the story needed some CPR",1274832000,,278,4.264150943396227
644635,4,6303447589,"Drop Zone (1994) makes the grade as a remarkable action movie. The
energized soundtrack matching the action scenes is also flawless, as
is the crystal clear widescreen presentation and filming, not the
least of which is a script having a realism that leaves no stone
unturned. It plainly build and shows how Gary Busey's character
acquired his professional skills, the blueprint and idea he's
actioning, in becomeing a black hat, vs the earlier white hat for
the DEA, turning to the other side.

Wesley Snipes is naturally suited to the action role. Grace
Zabriskie's small role is not to be underestimated, as well as that
of the other 10 or 20 actors, as they ""connect"" to the audience,
almost person-to-person.

Consultants were hired, clearly, in verifying the script considering
the manner in which a wide spectrum of spots were filmed, such as
the amusement park (with attractions in defying gravity), the
skydiving school on Sugarloaf Key (not far from Key West, Miami),
the penitentiary (where a code breaker makes a run for it), the US
Marshals, parole officers, discussion of the altitude limitations of
chute jumps (20,000 ft), military jargon (SOP, C3), guessing how a
DNA analysis and forensics is done on a crime scene, laying out how
a plane is commandeered, the result of loss of cabin air pressure on
a 727, narcotics runs from Bermuda or Bahamas on small single-engine
planes,  tear gas canisters, UZI's, jumping a thumbprint scanner,
rappelling in an elevator shaft, remote control of a full gamut of
building mechanisms from a central computer, etc.

The special effects are notable, such as when passenger seats are
pulled from the airplane into wide open skies, as a gaping hole
opens in the airliner's frame.

Indeed, special mention should be made for the number and quality of
stunts, which cannot be overestimated. This comprises jumping off
skyscrapers and landing skillfully on a flat bed truck, landing a
chopper on the pad of a moving yacht, and the chute scenes often are
chilling in their audacity, ""swimming"" through the skies as were an
ocean.

Busey is convincing in his dealings with the underworld, intent on
taking back whatever the DEA is holding in their ""evidence locker"",
through few words.

The film connects with all audiences, emphasized in particular by a
variety of characters.

On the improvement side, one concern might touch upon the number of
stabbings, slashings, point blank shootings over the story, as those
aspects don't necessarily add to the story, especially when the
ending scene is a happy-ending in the Hollywood tradition, and the
good-vibe and entertainment aspect is overwhelming over much of the
movie.

Secondly, a tighter editing could have  the case, by eliminating the
bullseye jumper competitions, or showing off the group formations in
the skies.

Next, the fact that Snipes is a one-man team, takes away or is
distraction, as it tends to draw it to a one-dimensional one man
show, when all the other ingredients are multi-dimensional in the
story.

Lastly, Snipes' body to body combat scenes at times are not always
convincing, the blows failing to land obviously and simulated. Maybe
1 or 2 jump scenes seen very early in the movie, are obviously
visibly contrived in a studio, although afterwards, that is not the
case.

In sum, one would be hard pressed to find a more adrenaline packed
picture than this one.",1266278400,,3385,5.001779359430605
644636,2,6303447589,"If you're a skydiver, you'll love this movie.  For everybody else, it's boring.  It's not a typical action-packed Wesley Snipes movie.  This one focuses on skydiving, and that's about it.  Lots of skydiving, and then some more skydiving.  They just threw in some token fight scenes at random to help tone it down, but it doesn't work.  I gave it ** because Snipes is in it.  Without him, it would get *.",979084800,2,403,4.513888888888889
644637,3,6303447589,"The plot of ""Drop Zone"" is virtually a scene-for-scene rehash of Snipes's more solid and more action-packed ""Passenger 57"". The aerial hijacking, the formula revenge plot and the final confrontation with  the chief villain are transferred from the earlier film with very little  variation. Some of the skydiving stunts are simply breathtaking; the rock  score is brilliant, but, eventually, the film is let down by its modest  script, its lack of a sexual interest and unmemorable storyline. Unlike  ""Passenger 57"" it is an aerial thriller that fails to go airborne  but crash-lands unspectacularly into a sea of forgettability.",959472000,2,628,5.357142857142857
644638,4,6303447589,"Basically, this plays like any other Wesley Snipe's movie.  The bad guys under-estimate him so they get dealt with.  Whats the difference with this one then, this one is actually good.  It has good one-liners, a  good-looking female lead that people would've actually heard of and,  there's top action to boot.  What more do you want from a movie I hear you  ask?
Well, there is more and that is the soundtrack.  What surprised me  was that there's a lot of good rocky, funky tunes on there that fit in  perfectly with the action on the screen.
Let me tell you about the  action.  It's excellent!  Even if you're not a sky-diving fan, this will  make you want to take it up.  You always know when a films good and that's  when you want to be or do what that actor is doing in the film.  Drop Zone  achieves this with flying colours.
One problem with this film however is  that some of the effects are now looking a bit ropey.  This, thankfully, is  only on about a total of 5 seconds worth of effects from the whole film.  This is quite an achievement considering that the film is all about effects  and stunts.  What do you expect, it is about sky-diving after all.
In  complete, this film is a good, all-round action film even if you don't know  anything about sky-diving or even if you don't have an interest in  sky-diving.
For this price, you can't go wrong!",957052800,7,1363,4.3694779116465865

""Taking Crime To New Heights"" - ""Drop Zone"" movie poster tag line

Five ADVENTUROUS Stars. The high-octane 1994 flick, ""Drop Zone"", is one of the excellent and early movies by action star Wesley Snipes around the time of his rapid rise to stardom in ""Passenger 57"" in 1992 and ""Boiling Point"" in 1993. In the plot, the skydiving theme is interwoven into the crime storyline as Snipes, a US Marshall, is determined to solve a mysterious, illogical case that he was involved in. And it's personal. Starring an outstanding cast of Snipes, Gary Busey, Yancy Butler, Michael Jeter, Kyle Secor, Corin Nemec, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Claire Stansfield, Grace Zabriskie, Rex Linn, Sam Hennings, Luca Bercovici, Andy Romano, and more. The exciting aerial stunts were coordinated by B. J. Worth. Stunt coordination by Shane Dixon. Music Supervison by Tim Sexton. Directed by John Badham. Excellent, unusual skydiving scenes, a fast pace, and brawls galore serve to enhance the unfolding drama of this enjoyable movie. My Highest Recommendation. Five EXCITING Stars. (Paramount Pictures. Rated R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:41:30.)",1486598400,,1121,5.297752808988764

Snipes delivers a great performance and the secondary characters don't disappoint either.  Plot is typical for a fast paced action thriller like this but still more believable than most Segal or Van Damm flicks.  Great way to spend a couple hours.,1486339200,2,341,5.035714285714286

644773,3,6303447589,"Action movies require some suspension of belief but this one does push the limits. I think it does make up for that with a high degree of action. None the less, I wish they would have at least consulted a tenth grade science student on the subject of explosive decompression. The producers seem to have the idiotic idea that the pressure will not equalize until you get close to the ground and that it will just go on and on and on. I would ask them, where is all that extra air coming from? They also seem to have no concept about aircraft mechanics or aerodynamics. But there is a lot of action.

I found the performance by Yancy Butler to be particularly pathetic. The rest are competent enough but she is really sad and it was all I could do to keep watching anytime she opened her mouth.",1433980800,,792,4.315436241610739
