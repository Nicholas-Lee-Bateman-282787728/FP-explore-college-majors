8335886,3,B001QJ73JA,"The Death Factory Bloodletting (Sean Tretta, 2008)

Sean Tretta seems to have something of a bad rap over at IMDB, probably because of The Great American Snuff Film, which I haven't seen yet. I've been hearing bad things about it for years, but it's always been in the back of my head as one of those ""I have to see it to find out if it's really that bad"" movies. Having now seen his third feature, The Death Factory Bloodletting, I moved it way up the queue. This one is following along in IMDB-land, with a 4.4 rating as I write this, but I gotta say, I liked it a bunch.

This is a sequel to Death Factory, a 2002 film I also haven't seen, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt because I'm a fan of Brad Sykes, who directed that one (Sykes' Evil Sister II: Bound by Blood was one of the most pleasant surprises of my year's viewing). Here, we have a collection of sickos who have assembled to watch a bloodletting, defined in the film as the murder and torture of a kidnapped innocent. Among them we have such fine, upstanding citizens of the community as White Manson (Home Invasion's Shane Dean), Black Johnson (Twisted Soul's Kareem McRoy), Rubber Love (Machined's David C. Hayes), and a handful of others whose handles I can't reproduce in an Amazon review. The main character, however, is Ana (R.E.M.'s Claudia Vargas), who goes by the handle Massive 9, and we know from the opening scenes that she's the for ulterior motives, but telling you what would be a spoiler. Unfortunately for the folks who dropped two thousand bucks a head to attend this little gathering, it's actually been put together by a religious fanatic (To Wander in Pandemonium's Noah Todd) who thinks scum like this need to be wiped off the face of the Earth, and he's got the perfect tool to do it: his deformed, feral, cannibal sister Alexa (Michelle Mousel in her first screen role).

The first thirty minutes or so are setup, before things really get rolling, and given how little character development there is in the film (why make one character a white supremacist, throw him in a room with a black guy and a Latino woman, and ignore the possibilities?), it probably could have gone a little faster. After that, though, it becomes a straight-up action flick, and given that, it gets the job done and how. Complaints have been made about the lack of actual gore in the film, but I thought the cuts were done pretty well for a film that was obviously made on a very small budget. Hardcore gorehounds will probably be disappointed by the jump cuts (which remind me of pre-MPAA movies; you see the fist/knife/whatever headed for the intended victim, them you jump-cut to blood splashing the wall, or whatever), but it's all filmed well, and the guy who did the editing actually knew which end of the cutter to use. When it comes right down to it, the fight scenes, especially the climactic one, are a lot of fun. While this wasn't marketed as an action flick, I thought the fight scenes were better than those in most of the action movies I've run across in the past couple of months. Yeah, most of the big plot twists were predictable, but that was to be expected once we realized this wasn't going to be a deep, meaningful flick.

Not to say it couldn't have been better, naturally. Both Shane Dean and Kareem McRoy are good enough actors to have pulled off some real performances, had they been given a good enough script to have something to work with, but the one they got, co-written by Tretta and Mike Marsh (who previously collaborated on Death of a Ghost Hunter), gave them very little to work with. Vargas, on the other hand, is inconsistent; she's great during the fight scenes, especially in the final third of the movie, but in the opening scenes she's flat (I wonder if that was intentional, and if I should be blaming Tretta). In the end, though, it's a fun, watchable little flick that doesn't deserve the rep it's gotten at all. ***",1260489600,2,3945,4.536516853932584

First of all I liked the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Factory/dp/B00006L92G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Factory</a>. It was fun, exciting and cheesy in a good way. I like cheese, not just in my food :) First of all there was NO Tiffany Shepis! How can you have her play the main villainess (Alexa) in part 1 but have her M.I.A. in part 2? This seemed like a ""let's make a quick buck"" flick. The first film had heart and you could tell. This one just seemed like a bunch of people getting together to capitalize on the originality, flavor and courageousness of the first flick. I'm sure some people will like it, especially if they have never seen the first, but if you go in thinking this is an actual sequel you will be greatly disappointed. No Tiffany Shepis? At least Terror Toons 1 & 2 was made by the same people and was somewhat linear. Brain Damage Films put this out so if you're familiar with them you definitely know what your going to get when you hear that gravelly: ""Welcome Gorehounds."" At least the Terror Toons series was entertaining.",1257465600,,1152,4.912820512820513
8335888,1,B001QJ73JA,"My God, I should know better by now but I keep on wasting my money on dreadful films like this.

This is without any doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. The awful nu-metal music accompanying all the kills was almost as annoying as the ""creature"" characters and their terrible sniffing the air and tilting of the heads.

The description gives the impression that this is an extreme movie. It isn't. There is no imagination to the killings and most of it is off screen.

If you are a fan of traditional, high quality horror, avoid this film at all costs.",1250380800,3,563,4.394230769230769

8335890,5,B001QJ73JA,"I was very happy with this movie, I was expecting a lame indie American film. I was very pleased with it though. Some of the blood looks a little fake, but most of the time it looks extremely real. The acting was great. You could almost smell the fear. I was very happy to find out that the movie was made in Arizona. It made me proud to know that such a great film could come out of this desert. The story line always made sense and you never once went ""why did they do that?"". All in all, you will not be wasting your money on this film, there's gore, a story line, and a hot naked chick, what more could you ask for in a horror movie??",1246924800,2,638,3.953488372093023
8335891,4,B001QJ73JA,"I'm not sure if this is a sequel or not but, either way its a great film.  Its got blood, violence, and nudity.  It also has some great little twists in the film.  For a low budget film it entertained me for the entire running time.  Check it out...",1241136000,,249,4.020408163265306
8335892,4,B001QJ73JA,I really enjoyed this psychotic piece of film. This movie may not be for everyone considering content. If you like crazy little horror flicks than you may want to consider watching this low budget charmer--giggle.,1241136000,,213,5.114285714285714
8335893,5,B001QJ73JA,"When I watched an advanced copy of the final cut for this film, I was blown away. Well shot, well acted and well produced. The story was good and a few performances really stood out. Denny, played by Noah Todd, did a awesome job as the crazy religious nut overseeing the bloodletting and Ana, Claudia Vargas, also has a stand out performance which is unmatched.

This film is not your typical slash and gash horror film. Sean Tretta, the director of ""Death of a Ghost Hunter"" and ""The Great American Snuff Film"" continues to improve by leaps and bounds with each film and will be a very successful director someday. His attention to detail is unmatched and his writing is far better than most studio films in my opinion.

The DVD menu's on the disc are very cool and the special features are pretty good as well. The film looks AMAZING (HD 16x9) with the blacks very pronounced, clear and film like. Again Sean Tretta's eye for detail comes out in every shot.

This film takes off and does not stop until all are dead! Check this film out. It's absolutely one to pick up!",1236729600,7,1071,4.482051282051282
