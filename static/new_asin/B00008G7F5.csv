7982535,5,B00008G7F5,"Funny, risky humor at times, action packed, and full of lovable, cute characters.  Also longer than the description given by a fellow buyer.  If you've had second thoughts about seeing Anime about cars, this might be the one to sell you on them.",1374105600,4,245,4.674418604651163
7982536,5,B00008G7F5,"What can I say.  This is a great little OVA, especially if you happen to be a car lover, or you happen to have a soft spot for anything with a Lotus or Lancia badge on it.

The story is set in the future where cars are driven by AI computers and most people have lost the ability to drive.  However, the AIs sometimes glitch, sending the cars wild.  Enter the eX-Drivers: Lisa, Lorna and Souichi, driving 20th century cars, tasked with chasing down the run-aways and reighning them in (preferably) before they can do any serious damage.

One thing I really did like about this (apart from that it features some of my favorite vehicles) is that often the characters dress in period clothes associated with their cars.

The only real problems I had with it were that the people who did the dub into English obviously didn't take the time to research the cars they were talking about.  Hence the car names are invariably miss-pronounced, to the point of calling the Lotus Europa as ""European Model Lotus"".  The OTHER problem was that it was way to short (only 6 episodes).

Personally, I really enjoyed this.  A must buy for any fans of old cars.",1124323200,5,1143,4.504854368932039
7982537,4,B00008G7F5,"This is the kind of anime to watch when you feel tired or sad; it's very pretty, easygoing, and doesn't make a lot of demands on your intelligence or emotions.  I found ""Ex-Driver"" a charming, relatively lighthearted show with a ridiculous premise which allows the animators to show us many scenes of pretty girls driving fast cars.  Kosuke Fujishima's familiar character designs (Oh My Goddess, You're Under Arrest, Sakura Wars) and his love for mechanical devices are on display as Lisa, Lorna and Souichi do their work saving a near future Tokyo (considerably cleaner and more elegant looking than today) from runaway AI cars.  Characterization is okay but simple; as usual with Fujishima, the characters are very distinct and somewhat stereotyped, but I liked them anyway and found them fun to watch.  The animation is better than it had to be; some of the jerkyness that another Amazon reviewer described as ""dicey"" comes from the relatively low frame rate of anime in general.  The cars are very well realized for such complex machines.  I understand that Fujishima's manga of the same title goes into more plot and character development; the anime basically contents itself with an episodic story.  In short a light, amusing, friendly anime with a little fan service and a lot of ""car service.""  Enjoy!",1080518400,2,1309,5.0
7982538,4,B00008G7F5,"Set in the future we find a majority of the vehicle are AI. The Ex-Drivers are a speicalised group of people who chase down and stop the cars.
It is kind of sad that the series was only six episodes. It should have been a little longer. Car detailing is rather good and there is a bit of exaggerated manuvering on the part of the way the cars handle but that is expected. Overall a good clean show, with a small amount of sexual situations. Older woman with younger male character.",1077926400,2,481,4.2967032967032965
7982539,5,B00008G7F5,"Hi. I watched this and i REALLY liked it alot, it was funny, it had action, and it was just interesting. This DVD had great graphics and great sound. Although in a couple of places on the english track your supposed to here Soichi say something but there is no sound. This also happens once with one of the bad guys but i still REALLY liked this DVD. You can bet as soon as it comes out to buy, (i rented it) I will buy it.",1058745600,,423,3.9302325581395348
7982540,5,B00008G7F5,"This was a great series, well more like a mini-series. There were only 6 episodes, but still it was really great. What I really like was that, the world is advanced, with ai controlled cars and the better cars are the older lower-tech cars! I think that there should be more episodes, and that more would make it even better. A lot of it is funny, and if you really like anime(chicks) its a really good DVD to get, not just for that, but it is a plus. The driving is awesome and storyline is great. If you don't buy it, atleast rent it, it would be well worth the money. Have Fun  :o)",1056326400,2,584,4.12280701754386
