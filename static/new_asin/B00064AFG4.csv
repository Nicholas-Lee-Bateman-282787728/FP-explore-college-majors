2165606,5,B00064AFG4,"There is no question that this is a five-star film in the lesbian film world. In addition to great acting and good production, the script is sexy, intelligent, fearless, adventurous, comical, and unique.

It's 1993, San Francisco, and Lou (Michelle Wolfe) and Sassy (Danielle Feraro) find themselves in the middle of an exhilarating journey of steamy unexpected San Francisco fun. Shortly after moving to the city, they are working in a small grocery store with a sexy dominatrix boss; living upstairs from a queer couple who has been stuck in an unhappy, rigid-gender-roled, sexless relationship for years; and finding themselves overall living in a whole new world: San Francisco. Diving head first into a sexy non-monogamous S&M dyke scene full of gender-variance and radical roles, the two lovebirds learn more than they could ever expect.

Mango Kiss is a brilliant and unique portrayal of queer love outside of traditional boundaries. It plays with identities and roles, and ultimately finds the sexiest roles of all. Guaranteed to turn you on, inspire new ideas, and give you a glimpse into a world you may or may not know, it's the kind of

movie that makes you love to be queer. It's perfect, really, and would appeal to almost anyone.",1121817600,7,1244,5.0
2165607,2,B00064AFG4,"The box cover bills this film as a ""wildly entertaining and sexy comedy of errors"", which is an overstatement of barely forgivable proportion.  First, Mango Kiss is only mildly entertaining.  Yes, it is sexy in a lesbian, kinky role playing kind of way.  But the comedy is slight, limited to some wry observations by Lou (Michelle Wolfe) who provides a voice-over narration that does little to move the story along.

Lou and her friend Sassy (played by Daniele Ferraro) move to San Francisco to discover themselves and define their relationship.  That definition eventually evolves into ""captain and young boy"", which seems to work for the two lovers, were it not for Sassy's wandering eye and experimental libido.  Hence the errors.

A psychologist would probably have a field day with this film as it trots out one alternative personality after another.  My problem is not with the roles that the characters indulge themselves in, so much as the idea that they have to immerse themselves so fully into these roles that their lives are taken over by the role playing.  The overriding question might be ""does Sassy love The Captain, or does she love Lou?  And is Lou really The Captain or just a personna for her to slip into from time to time?

The script is uneven at best, but the collection of characters does provide some interest; from the neighbor couple that lives a 50's sitcom suburban lifestyle (albeit a lesbian 50's sitcom) to various punk rockers, S and M and bondage adherents.  Sally Kirkland provides some spark as Sassy's mother, a survivor of the Free Love generation, who is supportive yet still a little bewildered by the entire thing.

There are far worse movies out there, but if you're looking for relationship insight or any kind of coherent story, consider something else.",1111449600,17,1798,4.875

2165611,5,B00064AFG4,"some fun! This film was just that. The previous reviewer who said it doesn't accurately portray lesbian life is taking it a little too seriously. This is not some documentary. It's a fun, lighthearted film about a lesbian couple who experiment with polyamory and some light s/m. No, it's not porny or anything. I think it's more in the line of Better than chocolate- because it's light and fun. There are lesbian chicks in San fran like this- as I know these kind of experinces personally. So, yes it's a comedy, it's about exploring open relationships, and just have fun with it. Lighten up! In fact, this film is a breath of fresh air, because it's not some redudant film ""explaining and trying to justify"" lesbian life. I'm so sick of those. Have some fun people!

2165613,1,B00064AFG4,I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  It almost entirely revolved around the butch/femme lesbian stereo types.  It was an extremely unrealistic portrayal of gay life to the point where I wouldn't want people to watch it.

I took it right out of the DVD player and threw it in the trash.

2165617,5,B00064AFG4,"I make no pretense to know whether this is a ""good"" or ""bad"" lesbian film. I don't even look at it that way. I will leave it up to the people who consider themselves experts on that topic to review it how they will. I doubt it was intended as a documentary or commentary on alternative lifestyles. That is just backdrop.

I like it because it is a fun romp about serious topics - relationships and identity. It is clever, well paced, well acted, well shot, and well edited - in other words, a good film. That alone is difficult to do - witness most of what Hollyweird turns out.

I liked the characters and cared about their journey, and it takes some pretty good story telling to lure this jaded old man.

For those who find the sex and kink too much or too little, I think that misses the point of the film. There is quite a bit of social commentary for those who can see it. It is subtle and not pounding you over the head.

I thought the sex was well balanced and well presented, given that it was a primary part of the plot.

(spoiler of sorts)

It even bows to the standard Hollyweird meme of monogamy as the ""proper"" relationship - which for many people it actually is.

I found it cute, fun, and well worth the time. I like it well enough to add the DVD to my own collection.",1383868800,,1283,4.17004048582996

2165631,3,B00064AFG4,This movie had the potential to be better. I read what it was about and thought it would be played out differently. Some of the actresses were really good.

2165632,1,B00064AFG4,"This was painful.  You know the little video progress bar at the bottom?  I kept checking it and thinking, ""if there isn't that much left, I might make it to the end.""  I swear the thing was going backwards.  The only reason I finished it is because I'm too OCD not to finish a movie.  But this one tested my affliction.

The ""princess"" whining and feet-stomping.  The ""manly"" arm-swinging.  Gross.  There was only one scene that seemed genuine and funny to me...between the two ""princesses"" after the affair.  But it was too short-lived to call redeeming.

Damn, this movie actually had some potential but it just got too freaky, low-budget weird...and I'm not talking about the spanking.  I'm a (real) captain and love all things boat but I just couldn't get past the absurdity of the imaginary sailing scenes.  (Maaaaaaybe if the characters were twelve.)  I would be too embarassed to watch this with another human.  Amazon...can you refund the last hour and a half of my life, plus interest?  I know; I shouldn't blame you.  You were just the messenger.

2165635,4,B00064AFG4,"I thought this movie was very, very strange when I first watched it. Spanking! Whipping! Boot-Licking! Oh My! For some weird reason, I wanted to watch it again. The next time, I viewed the movie as a comedy and it was hilarious! It was like watching a Lesbian Disneyland at play with some rather bizarre characters. At the same time, the characters are well-developed and show humanity which keeps them from turning into cartoons or caricatures. The S & M scenes are over-the-top, but that prevents them from being horrifying or painful to watch. To me, they are some of the funniest (yet weirdest) scenes in the whole movie.

Sass and Lou are two friends who move to San Francisco. Their relationship turns to that of lovers, but then the two decide to have a non-monogamous role-playing relationship. She and Lou adopt a Daddy/Girl relationship, where Lou is the ""Captain"" and Sass is the Princess. Along the way, the two meet other couples in role-playing relationships. There's Val and Leslie, a 1950s couple, who are an absolute hoot and remind me of my parents. Lou becomes less than enchanted with non-monogamy, but reluctantly goes along to please Sass. A newly minted Lesbian, Sass goes wild and starts having affairs with all sorts of women. She starts a Mother/Son S & M relationship with Mickey, who Lou clearly detests. Sass accepts Lou's attraction to her Store-Manager-By-Day-Dominatrix-By-Night boss Chelsea Chuwawa, but is disconcerted and threatened by Lou's attraction to the ultra-feminine 1950s, locket-wearing Leslie. A delightful character in the mix is Sass' Hippie Artist mother, Emilia, played to perfection by Sally Kirkland, who offers sage advice and cautions her daughter about her new open relationship. Things come to a head and Sass finally is smacked back to reality when she realizes she might lose Lou if their open relationship continues.

This film is about two women finding their way in San Francisco's Queer community, experimenting, then realizing what type of relationship works for them. Chelsea and Emilia guide and advise them along the way.

If S & M scenes bother you, then I wouldn't recommend this film. This film may offend those who are in such relationships depicted in this film, but this film is meant to be a comedy, not a realistic portrayal. If you're open-minded and you view this film as a romantic comedy, (albeit a rather unusual one), you'll enjoy it.",1295654400,2,2414,5.0
2165636,3,B00064AFG4,"I did not finish watching this movie, so I cannot say whether or not I enjoyed the entire movie, but the first half of the movie was very outdated and very slow-paced.",1285372800,,167,4.25
2165637,5,B00064AFG4,"I was a little skeptical of the movie at first, but then I got so drawn into it.  The main couple is SO believable!  Makes you want a relationship similar to the one they have in the movie.  I would definately recommend this to someone else and I do believe I'm about to watch it again!",1275177600,2,286,4.071428571428571
2165638,4,B00064AFG4,This movie was very cute.  I liked the first person narrative from the Lou character.  The main couple were very cute together and absolutely believable as a couple.  The premise was certainly real enough.  Some of the dream-like sequences were a little odd but no moreso than the first season of the L Word with the opening scenes there.  It ended the way it should and had a nice little lesson attached... maybe more than one.  We would recommend this for a nice evening in.,1262822400,,476,4.541176470588235
2165639,5,B00064AFG4,"Came acroos this film on Logo channel but could never see the whole film. Glad I bought the video as cable has too many commercials. The film is centered around two lesbians--Sassy & Lou, & set in the 90's in San Francisco. They set up house & stumble across other lesbians who are into roll playing. Sassy decides she'd like to try this but Lou (who is hot!) decides to play along in fear of losing Sassy. The film goes through the ups & downs of this unique ""family"" & the rolls.
To watch this you must keep in mind its a fun film, with some underlying issues of ""the grass is not always greener on the other side"". Daniele Ferraro plays Sassy, the one who wants to be taken care of & Michelle Wolff plays Lou, a stong rock to balance Sassy.
Would like to see Michelle Wolff play in a police officer roll!!

I tried by just watching ""at least 15 minutes"" and found that I didn't really know yet.  I then extended it another 15 minutes and found myself addicted and I couldn't stop watching until it was completely over.  I am very glad that I watched it, I fell in love.

2165643,1,B00064AFG4,"Ok, I am a member of what one reviewer called a ""stereotypical"" butch femme relationship.  I am also kinky, non monogamous, and in a daddy/girl relationship, so my problems with this film had nothing to do with these elements in the film.  In fact, i wish there were more films that represented these parts of our queer community.  But if i have to be represented by this crap, i'm going vanilla.

  I see a lot, a LOT of lesbian/dyke films, and this one was so, so bad that i had to watch it through my fingers most of the time.  The acting is painful, so awful, the storyline ridiculous and cringeworthy, and most of the sex uninspired.  And really, i felt like this film was trying to deal with ""roles"" or something, but produced by people who never talked to anyone in a d/g relatinship.... i ended up feeling insulted that this was the way the people ""learn"" about kink and daddy/girl.  sigh.

one good thing- there is some variety of size and color among the actresses (not the main characters, tho) in this film... that's a good thing to see in the mostly white-and-skinny world of lesbo film.

please, please don't see this film, unless you enjoy tormenting yoruself with atrocious filmaking.  I do, and i'm not even sure that will justify watching this horror again....",1196380800,17,1278,4.581497797356828
2165644,5,B00064AFG4,"It is hard to find lesbian films that veer from the norm. Having low budgets and time constraints, they often are taken as falling short of mainstream art. However working within those parametors, the  movie was great. Role playing, comedy, and truthfulness added depth to this project that was 4 years in the making. Yes, the situations were over exaggerated, sometimes campy but the actors brought to life the essence of this story. We all role play--we just call it by a different name. In the ""real world"" people do experiment with sex- do we label that kinky? If we like to wear jeans and baggy pants does that signal being a dyke/butch? If we are in love with someone but hide behind our feelings are we being truthful to ourselves? The chemistry between Lou (Michelle Wolff) and Sassy (Daniele Ferraro) was evident, sexy, but yet serious. The film proved credible by bringing these 2 out of character in the last scenes. In making mistakes they could at least salvage a relationship instead of walking away with regrets. Watch the behind the scenes footage and you will appreciate the characters.

Look, I must admit, I am not one for stereotypical butch and femme relationships so for starters that was a HUGE no-no for me. That just added to the fact that just about everything else in the movie was badly done.
