7813745,5,6301650778,"One of the series of Toscanini concert performances now available on video, this is a must have for all devotees of great conducting and fine singing.
The weakest among the singers, is (surprisingly) Richard Tucker, whose voice is a tad light for Rhadames.  The other singers (Nelli, Gustafsen, Stitch-Randall) are all quite adequate, with Valdengo and Norman Scott outstanding.
The main interest of the performance, however, is the conducting of 'The Maestro' Toscanini.  In this most familiar score, he constantly finds new insights and erases some of the indulgences of less talented band masters.
Of course, the picture is a fuzzy black and white but enough can be seen to make viewing an engrossing experience.  Highly recommended.",1194566400,,736,5.273504273504273
7813746,4,6301650778,"If your an Opera fan this video is a magnificent piece for your collection.  Although it has that antique film quality, that just adds to it's charm.  Aida is one of my personal favorites.  I have seen and heard, many Aida's from Sharon sweet, to Kathleen Battle, and Herva Nelli by far surpasses them all.  Her voice is perfect with every note sang.  I would rank her ahead of Maria callas, who was always hit or miss.  Richard Tucker is outstanding.  And Eva gustuvson, although very talented she lacked in power during a scene where  she cursess the high priest  at the end of act IV.  It goes without saying that Toscanini was at his best.  The Nbc Orchestra and Robert shaw chorale were in tip top shape.  This is not a staged production.  It is in concert form with an audience.  It is a must for any Opera fan, and especially for Aida lovers like myself.",970876800,11,861,4.401273885350318
