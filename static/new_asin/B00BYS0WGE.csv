5682827,5,B00BYS0WGE,It's become more than just conversations. We are really starting to get into the hilarious drama that is Fiona's life.,1404432000,,118,4.95
5682828,5,B00BYS0WGE,"We find the humor in this series absolutely hysterical and entertaining.  Kudrow is fantastic in her role as Fiona Wallace, and her choices for guest stars on this series is spot-on.  A real highlight is Lily Tomlin as Fiona's mother.  Try it!",1402876800,,243,4.738095238095238
5682829,5,B00BYS0WGE,"This series really showcases Lisa Kudrow's talent.
 She is hilarious! And of course, the co-stars, and special guests are the icing on the cake.",1389916800,,144,5.0
5682830,5,B00BYS0WGE,"great series.  Bought this as a gift for a friend recuperating.  Laughter is the best medicine (Therapy).  I have found that people either get this show or not.  The humor is subtle and dense. Each time I watch it ( I think it is that good, to be able to watch it more than once) I find new jokes that I missed the first time around.  Loads of guest stars: lily Tomlin, Rosie O'Don. (sos) etc.",1387497600,,393,4.118421052631579
5682831,4,B00BYS0WGE,"The second season of the show is just as good as the first. The celebrity guest stars are top-notch, and Lisa Kudrow - and everyone - is so great at improvising! The plot moves along nicely in the footage added to the web series content. You would never guess that segments of a single episode were filmed two or three years apart. One of the best shows on right now!",1386115200,,367,4.257142857142857
5682832,5,B00BYS0WGE,"Very Avant Garde.  This is a gem of a show. Its almost impossible to watch only one episode,  I have been binge watching, and I just keep wanting more.  Lisa Kudrow at her finest.  I hope this show is on for many more seasons.  Love!",1382832000,3,233,4.088888888888889
5682833,5,B00BYS0WGE,Really great and funny!  It's addicting and I want to but season 2 and the next season! Lisa Kudrow makes me laugh as a therapist. This is a must see!,1382140800,2,150,4.0
5682834,1,B00BYS0WGE,"Really did not like.  I watched part of episoide 1 and quit wating.  Tried another episode and quit that one also.  Would like to return season 1, but we cannot as it is used.  It is strange and returned season two which we also bought.",1381449600,,236,4.177777777777778
5682835,4,B00BYS0WGE,"I can't get enough of this series.  Lisa Kudrows character is hilarious, and as appalling as her behavior is, you find yourself drawn to her and want her to come out on top.  The rest of the cast is just as funny.  How can you go wrong with Lilly Tomlin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Meryl Streep, together on the same show?",1377388800,7,320,4.3
5682836,4,B00BYS0WGE,"the show is great..except the episode guide for each episode is wrong..episode 6 is actually episode 12..they are all one off..but other than that..Lisa,Dan and the cast of thousands is great..i would recommend this show highly.",1446163200,,228,5.361111111111111
5682837,5,B00BYS0WGE,Lisa Kudrow and her team are brilliant.  This is a very enjoyable program.  I'm purchasing Season 3 and watching Season 4.,1424563200,,122,4.761904761904762
5682838,5,B00BYS0WGE,Kudrow is a genius,1422662400,,18,3.75
5682839,5,B00BYS0WGE,"I had never seen Lisa Kudrow before this show. I never watched the well known ""Friends"" show by which most viewers recognize her. The same was true of Matt Le Blanc who I discovered for the first time on ""Episodes."" I think they are both terrific.

What Kudrow does so well on this show (and perhaps she did this on ""Friends"" too) is play someone who is totally self absorbed, unprincipled, greedy and capable of any kind of underhanded activity. Very famous actors drift in and out of her show because she sees them as their ""web therapist."" Since she is a horrible therapist, no actor has to stay on the show very long!

Most of the action unfolds as if you were using Skype on your computer. You see two open windows on a computer and those windows are filled with Kudrow and her patients. She also has others creep into the action too. She has a gay husband, Kip. Lily Tomlin is her mother and she loves Kip and hates her daughter. The interchanges with everyone are on the computer too in that Skype like mode.

As the viewer you quickly adapt to viewing this show despite its being a constant computer screen with two open windows. It bothered me for say the first five minutes of the first season and then I never noticed it again.

I have also tried watching her show ""Comeback"" but this is the show of hers which I like the best.",1422057600,,1338,4.36144578313253
5682840,5,B00BYS0WGE,Funny! This is my favorite Lisa Kudrow so far.,1421884800,,46,4.222222222222222

8575674,5,B00BYS0WGE,"I never watched Friends, so I don't know if this is Kudrows usual comedy style or not. However, Im a new fan. This show is full of dry, witty humor you have to pay attention to or youll miss. If you feel like punchline jokes are overrated, this is the show for you. Its like having a sarcastic family member who slips in sly remarks at family gatherings. Some family members catch it and chuckle, some are oblivious!",1530230400,,416,4.346153846153846
8575675,1,B00BYS0WGE,"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I RECEIVED THIS DVD, AND AGAIN, IT WAS DEFECTED IN THE SAME WAY THE 1ST ONE WAS! WILL SPEAK TO A MANAGER.",1507766400,,129,3.814814814814815

8575678,5,B00BYS0WGE,"It's dry, quirky, funny, hilarious! Small subtle things from each character, catch you off guard, again more laughter. Improve!? Crazy full of talent!",1495670400,,150,5.565217391304348
8575679,3,B00BYS0WGE,Pretty cute show- although not good enough to binge watch!,1484611200,,58,4.9
8575680,4,B00BYS0WGE,"Not as funny as the original web versions (which are incorporated here) since there's less ""analysis"", but more ordinary sitcom business forced into the 2-video screen format.  Overall, though, extremely well done, and the L. Kudrow wit and assortment of enthusiastic, funny, friends is hard to beat.  The treatment of Kip's transvestism outflanks all the current PC trans nonsense, as well, if you'd like to reassure yourself that the entire world hasn't gone completely crazy in that (and several other) regards.",1459814400,,514,5.333333333333333
8575681,4,B00BYS0WGE,"I love this show, but I was disappointed that it didn't have a cast narration like the first season. One of the reasons I bought it was because the narration in season 1 was hilarious.",1459296000,,184,4.285714285714286
