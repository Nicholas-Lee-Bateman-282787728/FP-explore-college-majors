8098804,5,B000CFFZE4,"""Little House on the Prairie"" premiered in 1974 with a pilot movie and then ran for a total of 8 full seasons, from 1974 until 1982, and from 1982 until 1983 by the title ""Little House: A New Beginning"" concluding with 3 TV movies during 1983-1984 (these are sometimes called ""season 10"" and have since been repackaged as part of the ""Little House: A New Beginning"" series). During the run of the series there were many extended eps that ran as 2-partners or double long programs and some that were 90 minutes in length. There was also a Thanksgiving retrospective TV movie titled ""The Little House Years"" from 1979 (although this is not part of season 6, this 3-part movie has been broken up into 3 eps and in syndication it pops up in this season, although it is not included on the DVDs). BTW, the complete sereis, with lots of extras, in a limited edition boxed set is coming out in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/November/dp/B001EL6ECM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">November</a>.

Michael Landon (may he rest in peace) was the star, executive producer, director and in some cases even writer of LHOTP. As Charles Ingalls he was also the voice of compassion and the voice of forgiveness and redemption. I can't think of another TV character that is more loved and more known for being a good man and a good father than Charles Ingalls and that's because of Michael Landon. Michael Landon gave life to a man that most of us never knew before. He gave him a heart. But most of all, Michael Landon's best work was done in the back of the house, not on camera. Because he wasn't some big-shot who needed to be seen and who needed to be some big star, he was just happy producing quality television. And that's really the cusp of LHOTP: quality. Because of Mr. Landon, the series resonates with just about everyone. I cannot think of another person who is or was ever able to accomplish such a behemoth task. He set a standard of excellence that no one has ever been able to match, before or since.

What I loved the most about Charles Ingalls was that he was just a regular man. He didn't have any super powers, he didn't fly through the air, he wasn't rich and he wasn't worldly. But you know what? That didn't matter because Michael Landon gave him such a warm spirit. Perhaps this was the first time on TV that it was OK for a man to cry because Charles Ingalls was very sensitive. For kids to see this was exceptional because it told them that it was OK to share their feelings and it was fine to be afraid. I am reminded of a statement from the series (Fight Team Fight!/Season 7), ""hurting someone doesn't make you a man, it's learning to love them.""

But that doesn't mean that Charles was a pushover in the slightest bit. He had a nice right-hook, especially concerning the well-being of his family. I love the time when Charles went up against those 2 men who made a lewd comment about Mary (""that's a mighty good looking blind girl you got"") and Charles beat them silly. Like Mr. Kenny Rogers said, ""sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man.""

As someone who has grown up watching LHOTP I can tell you with all honesty and certainty that every single ep is excellent because each one has a value all its own. There is a lesson to each and every episode of LHOTP but it's never hokey or preachy and it's always different. However the one message that I always got out of the series was to have compassion for other. And perhaps the second most learned lesson that I took from the series was to have trust because in the end we are all in essence good people.

The show was based on the series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (later by Rose Wilder Lane). However, after the third season rather than relying as heavily on the books, the writers and the producers took more poetic license. IMO these are some of the best eps because they are all so creative and life-affirming, not to mention wholesome and articulate. If you want to see a quality series then I strongly recommend getting ""Little House on the Prairie.""",1223337600,4,4081,4.592592592592593

Best entertainment investment I've ever made!",1140652800,19,305,4.545454545454546
