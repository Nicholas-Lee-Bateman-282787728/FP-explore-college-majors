3747144,4,B001PCJG34,"This video covered a lot of the same scenery that we saw last winter when we meandered in our motorhome from Florida's ""Nature Coast"" around the Gulf of Mexico to Padre Island.  They covered a lot of the best sights in the video, but spent a little too much time (it seems these six or seven years later) on the damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  It would have been nice to include more information about good places to camp in an RV, since it is part of an RVing series.",1407628800,,478,4.241758241758242

3747146,4,B001PCJG34,"Very interesting video. Enjoyed learning about new place to stay on the gulf coast. Can't wait to discover the new discovered places.

Video quality was great.

Video was a little long toward the end.

Toward the end it was more a Katrina Hurricane information video vs a RV travel video. Lost interest.

Plan on watching Alaska RV and the other RV videos.",1382918400,,356,4.693548387096774
3747147,5,B001PCJG34,"This six volume set is a great way to experience the natural wonders of the Gulf Coast, Baja, Alaska and the East Coast.  The photography is amazing, especially the close-ups of many types of birds and other wildlife from whales to hummingbirds.  Included also are parades, celebrations, stops at curio shops, restaurants, museums, conversations with local residents, a little bit of history, as well as several scenic side trips via boats and planes. If you enjoy leisurely paced armchair travel, you will enjoy these DVDs.",1368057600,2,524,5.152941176470589

3747149,4,B001PCJG34,"For a low budget production it was really well done. While all the information about the Katrina rebuilding dates it a bit, it will always be important to the history of the area. I learned a lot and added several places to my ""to visit"" list after seeing this video.",1367539200,,267,4.36
3747150,2,B001PCJG34,"Boring, dated, and poor resolution quality.  I feel ripped off.  This was a gift for my RVer husband, and he's not even motivated to watch all of them.",1361836800,2,151,4.357142857142857
3747151,4,B001PCJG34,"This is a self produced and handled product and as such it has good intentions and is, for the most part, worth the money. I intend to spend next winter on the gulf coast in my RV and his supplied a lot of good information. My only complaint is that the folks who made this did so right after Hurricane Katrina had hit the gulf coast and they spent much of their time on that. While I admire that, the information is now several years out of date and can easily be skipped. But all in all this is the only information in one place about this wonderful RV drive and I don't regret spending the money at all.",1332460800,,606,4.100840336134453
