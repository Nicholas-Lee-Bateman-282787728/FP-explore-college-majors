7538461,2,B0182KZKB8,"Sooo damn predictable....even if it's the truth. Predictable and stupid. Justice wasn't served. The whole family, children included, knew something wrong was going on and didn't report it. The children, wife especially, should have served longer sentences.  Anyone of them, at anytime could have turned in the old man....even the son that ran.  Cowards, all.",1467676800,,358,5.490909090909091

7538464,4,B0182KZKB8,A based on true story of a family clan in Argentina that used blackmail to get money led by the father and involving some of the family children.  The story moves along quickly even though they give away the ending in the beginning.  Well worth watching.,1466985600,,254,4.5

7538469,3,B0182KZKB8,"While explorations of literal crime families have become somewhat pass ever since ""The Sopranos"" redefined them so well, few come with the political backdrop or allegorical strength as Pablo Trapero's Silver Lion award-winner, ""The Clan"". The fragile hopefulness of Argentina's turn towards democracy following the military dictatorship's collapse in 1983 serves as the framework for an unbelievable true gangster story that clearly owes a lot to Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" stylistically, from its use of classic rock to the way it balances grim violence with dark humor. These qualities, along with a mesmerizing lead performance, are what propel the film beyond Trapero's inability to reconcile his directorial strengths with the bizarre material at his command.

Through casual eyes the Puccio family, the titular clan, seems like the model of upper middle class respectability. Underneath it...well, that's something totally different. Family patriarch Arquimedes (Guillermo Francella) gives the impression of cool reservation, but in his chest beats the heart of a sociopath. He had been part of Argentina's totalitarian government that was embroiled in what it called the ""Dirty War"", state-sponsored kidnappings that disappeared thousands. But with the regime decimated and democracy taking shape, Arquimedes has figured out his skills can still be put to good use for more personal gain.

Arquimedes recruits his kin into the family business like a Dad passing down his pizza shop. His son Alex (Peter Lanzani) is the one we spend the most time with, as he's the one with the brightest future and seemingly the most to lose by engaging in a life of crime. A rugby star with long curly locks that would instantly make him a sex symbol, Alex uses his easy charms and connections to wealthy sports families to find future targets; sometimes intentionally and other times less so. What's clear is that in Argentina's shaky financial climate the kidnapping business is definitely booming.

As the dictator of his own little family, Arquimedes inspires a culture of willing acceptance to his evil crimes; screams and wails from his captives, or ""guests"", can be heard throughout the home while others, such as Arquimedes' loving wife Epifania (Lili Popovich) go about their lives like nothing is wrong. Meanwhile, on the outside world amongst the upper-class community, an air of fear permeates as they all expect to be the next one taken. Trapero, a serious dramatic filmmaker, creates an atmosphere of unbelievable terror, underscored by the family's cold detachment from the heinous acts they're committing.

But things change once Alex realizes just how psycho his father really is. As people he knows, some even friends, begin to die, Alex grows disillusioned at the illegal enterprise. However, Trapero doesn't focus much on this storyline which seems like it should be the centerpiece. Instead, Alex's seduction back into the family is incredibly simple and poorly explained, while the icy Arquimedes and his demonic charms slide to the forefront. It's great in that Francella's performance is riveting and ranks right up there with some of the best criminal patriarchs ever. But on the other hand, the movie's central moral conflict is never really dealt with, much less resolved. As the film tries to paint Alex as a conflicted Michael Corleone-esque character it doesn't have the foundation to support such a notion. Also, while Trapero comically contrasts the Puccio's violent crimes with catchy rock tunes such as ""I'm Just a Gigolo"" and The Kinks' ""Sunny Afternoon"", it doesn't always feel like a natural fit for the director, whose approach is generally less flashy. That said; he does a bang-up job cross-cutting timelines, beginning with a frenetic home invasion that looks like one thing, but turns out to be something completely different by the movie's end.

Produced by the same people behind ""Wild Tales"", the Oscar-winning film that so easily made disturbing acts worthy of a good laugh, it's easy to see where the inspiration for ""The Clan""'s tone comes from. And while it's incredibly effective as a crime picture and look at Argentina's dubious steps into democracy, the questions it raises are as casually disregarded as Arquimedes' many victims.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Clan/dp/B01CTGLSKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Clan</a>",1463788800,2,4416,5.459736456808199

7538473,4,B0182KZKB8,"This movie will have more meaning to anyone who has ever lived in Buenos Aires and is familiar with the history of military dictatorship and the adjustment period after its fall. The case drew attention for the horrifying murders orchestrated by a family with a psychopath as its head, but also for the incredible failed suicide attempt of his son, a rugby player for Argentina's national team. He was in such phenomenal shape that he survived a headfirst leap from the fifth floor of the courtroom building. I had not followed the story after that, so I enjoyed the many twists and turns of a fascinating case that ultimately came to light through interviews with the patriarch in the years just before his death.",1472083200,,714,4.766129032258065

7538480,5,B0182KZKB8,"Having lived in Buenos Aires in the late 1980s, just as Argentina began its democracy, I was witness to the disparate situation confronting those for change and those still adhering to the military regime. It was a corrupt time indeed. But more than elucidating the darker side of politics, extortion, bribery, kidnapping, and vengeance, this film approaches what it is like to face personal moral decisions in a patriarchal society. For those who have excoriated this film because it has subtitles, I feel sorry for your sorry limitations. It is a powerful film that deals with our humanity--and venality-- on several levels.",1469145600,8,626,5.147058823529412

8741132,4,B0182KZKB8,Just watched this on Netflix and it was not at all disappointing because I expected more of a documentary than a drama/action movie. What was fascinating about it was how cavalier and brazen everything was considering the time and events in Argentina. It really was surprising how an entire family could be involved in or have knowledge of the crime that was happening in their own home holding someone for ransom in your basement never struck me as a viable alternative. It does have a good closing that explains what happened to all involved.,1531008000,,544,4.797872340425532

8741138,4,B0182KZKB8,"After the fall of General Galtieri in 1980s Argentina; some of the old guard did not accept that democracy and law and order were here to stay. They wanted the old ways back and the money that went hand in hand with corruption. The Puccio family was ahead of the pack, the patriarch was one Arquimedes Puccio played by the ever reliable Guillermo Francella (The Secret in their eyes) and he led his whole family and a gang in kidnap torture and extortion.

His middle son was Alex who was a rising star in Rugby Union and his eldest brother had already done the same but had side stepped the family and escaped to New Zealand. However many hands do make light work and so Arquimedes went out of his way to ensure as many of the Clan as possible were hands on.

Now this is based on a real story and it is quite amazing that a modern country could allow such atrocities to take place  but that is the way of the World with criminals everywhere. The film itself is Argentinas biggest earner ever and you can see why. The acting is all great as is the period detail. It jumps around from past to present etc but that is easy to follow. There are some upsetting scenes but the nasty stuff is mostly played down. This is a film that you may get more from on a second viewing but either way it is most certainly worth seeing at least once.",1477180800,,1333,4.24015748031496
