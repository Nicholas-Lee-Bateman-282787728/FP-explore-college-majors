8390205,4,B0036UNKD0,"Matt Temkin does a fine job of showing the versatility of point shooting and thankfully shows how it meshes well with more recent techniques. I recently shot my state's law enforcement qualification, and for everything under 15 yards, I used point shooting techniques. I managed a score of 44 out of 48.",1426464000,2,303,4.846153846153846
8390206,5,B0036UNKD0,"This movie is a great buy for the money. It's not a hollywood production, it's a niche low budget film for people who want the correct information.

What it won't do is teach someone who doesn't have their fundamentals down. And by that I mean it won't teach you sighted fire,clearing malfunctions, and the basics of gun safety, though honestly it shouldn't because this isn't a cure all for a lack of gun skills.

It also doesn't put any of the techniques described to work with force on force drills, or show any footage of real gun fights, which would in fact be the only thing I would have liked to see added.

What it does do is cover just about everything else in terms of close quarters fighting. This video is what I would describe as instant, no nonsense gratification on the Applegate/Fairbairn/Sykes system with updates to correct the AFS systems flaws.

It's all very simple and can be learned very quickly because it all works with natural movements and instincts, and it is in fact so easy that you don't really need to practice it very often. If you have your fundamentals down and don't know much about close quarters fighting, or even if you think you do but don't know the AFS system, this video is for you.",1358640000,2,1225,4.529411764705882

8390208,4,B0036UNKD0,"The techniques and tactics in this informative DVD focus on the ""Point Shooting"" methods taught by  the legendary Col. Rex Applegate.  One of the many things I like about this method of street combat shooting is that the techniques and tactics are based upon the natural startle reflex actions of the body.  Matthew Temkin, learned these principles from his father and from Rex Applegate.

The material covered in this DVD include:  The basic concepts of ""Point Shooting.""  How accurate Point Shooting is from one foot to 6 yards.  The techniques are shown both holstered and with the gun already in your hand.  He also demonstrates the disadvantages of using two-hands to shoot, but emphasizes that this does not mean you should never use two-hands.  The emphasis is on using one-hand, especially if you are within grappling range with your assailant.

The basic stance and moving forward & backward is simple and natural.  One of your feet should be slightly ahead of the opposite foot when employing point shooting techniques.  This instruction DVD also emphasizes moving forward in a natural walking method as you shoot multiple times at your target.

Shooting while moving drills are shown in this DVD, as well as dealing with multiple assailants.  There is an enormous amount of solid and practical information in this DVD and this short review merely touched upon some of the material in this DVD.  In conclusion, if you desire to learn how to ""Point Shoot"" at close range, this DVD is for you.  It has numerous drills that will improve anyone's close quarter combat shooting skills.
