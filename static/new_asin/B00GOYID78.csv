6097699,5,B00GOYID78,"If you are a fan of Asian cinema, then this is a no-brainer of a purchase...
I myself am a great admirer of the films from both China and South Korea, so when I caught wind that Korea was working on their take of the great Johnnie To produced Hong Kong thriller ""Eye in the Sky"", I was definitely anticipating it(to say the least). The end result with ""Cold Eyes"" was NOT a let down! In my opinion,  they actually managed to surpass the original. Anyone who's ever enjoyed what South Korean cinema has to offer knows that intensity and style usually take the lead in their thrillers. Taking advantage of modern production values, ""Cold Eyes"" is certainly much more sleeker, stylized and violent than its predecessor, It definitely ups-the-ante on a hi-tech level too.

My main reason for leaving this review though is actually to enlighten anyone who is curious about the quality of the various versions currently available on Blu-ray. Even though Blu-rays from Asia are now the same region code as the US, I still personally can't afford the versions that import directly from Korea. Unfortunately,  ""Cold Eyes"" was never distributed through any local retailers here in the US as well. So, I was happy to see that Hong Kong sellers here on Amazon had it at a very reasonable price. I picked-up the Chinese CM Entertainment Ltd. version for under $15 and the quality is AMAZING! So, for anyone contemplating whether or not they wanna buy the Chinese release of this hit Korean flick, give it a shot! The sound, picture and subtitles are all top-notch.

Oh yeah, and for the fans of the original Hong Kong version, be sure to keep an ""eye"" out for an awesome cameo of one of the lead actors from the original.  :)",1424736000,3,1712,4.636963696369637

6097701,5,B00GOYID78,"I'm surprised I don't type this review with sore fingers, because if ever there were a film that had me literally biting my nails, from start to finish, Cold Eyes would be it.  Even within the first ten minutes of the film, part of which depicts a highly efficient bank robbery pulled by a gang thieves led by one super-hardcore bad-ass, the film sucks you in and refuses to let go, before unfolding the story of a high-tech police surveillance team, seen through the eyes of its newest female recruit, as they try to find the bank robbers and shut down their organization.  Finally catching a break upon finding a low-level lookout for the gang, the rest of the film is a cat-and-mouse rollercoaster of tracking that guy to his confederates ... and, ultimately, their VERY nasty boss.  Violence abounds, but what else to expect in such a film - and NO ONE does crime thrillers better than Korean cinema, with this (like The Suspect) a MUST-SEE that will keep your heart pounding in your chest until the end credits roll.",1423267200,3,1021,4.629834254143646
6097702,5,B00GOYID78,The Korean company bought the story from a HK movie company and made it more interesting to watch. Love the one made in HK and love the Korean one more. Even if U have already watch the original you should still watch this.,1419724800,2,223,4.209302325581396
6097703,4,B00GOYID78,"A rookie detective Ha Yoon-joo (Han Hyo-joo) joins a police surveillance unit trying to track down a highly organized criminal group led by ruthless James (Woo-sung Jung). Talented but still inexperienced, Ha Yoon-joo (codenamed Piggy) has to learn a lot from her immediate superior, Chief detective Hwang (Sol Kyung-gu), who becomes something like a strict but considerate mentor to her.

If the story sounds familiar, perhaps you have seen the original of this Korean thriller. Cold Eyes (Gam-si-ja-deul) is in fact a remake of a 2007 Hong Kong film Eye in the Sky (Gun chung). Simon Yam, one the stars of the original, is briefly seen in a cameo role in Cold Eyes.

The difference between the two versions is clear from the beginning. Cold Eye, which is longer than the original by about thirty minutes, looks more like a Hollywood-made action flick, for better or worse. With more focus on action and high-tech devices, Cold Eyes is probably more accessible than Eye in the Sky, whose muted storytelling style may not suit everyones taste.

Cold Eyes is an effective thriller with several interesting characters. The acting is first-rate and the narrative slick. The remake is entertaining, though some viewers may miss the more atmospheric touch of the original.",1413158400,3,1267,5.052631578947368

8625934,4,B00GOYID78,"Like all Korean movies, the acting is very good and the dialogue is important to the film. While the film was predictable (for me) and lacks back story or details of the intricate plot you'd expect, it's still an entertaining watch. I wouldn't rank it near truly great films like the Vengeance trilogy. This is more like a good slightly bubble gum crime film. I think that the beginning is fun and part of what keeps you in the film. The premise is a young rookie police investigator with fantastic ability to recall people, places and things she observes on the job becomes acclimated with the difficulties on the job. Her first mission is to help the team stop a crime group that has already pulled off one extremely well planned heist.",1446940800,,738,4.598484848484849

8625936,5,B00GOYID78,"More evidence, generally, of superb Korean film-making. The ending was a bit too contrived: Korean policemen seem not only to be damned lucky in picking out perpetrators in a crowd but also seem to have (a) either incredible regenerative powers after being stabbed or shot OR (b) the most effective body armor ever made. However, I really loved the film until then. Incidentally, for 4 years I lived just blocks away from where the action takes place (though the names of the banks was changed) and was never aware of all the CCTV cameras in and around Seoul. This is one place you definitely don't want to commit a crime!",1426982400,,622,4.663636363636364
