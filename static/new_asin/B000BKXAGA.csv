2423438,4,B000BKXAGA,"Just as porn star biographies seem to be hitting the book shelves with more frequency, the same apparently is true of the porn star film documentary. This time up, it's THE GIRL NEXT DOOR Stacy Valentine. Bored housewife from Oklahoma who, upon her husband's urging, discovered her love for taking it off for the camera. Talk about the cliche of getting what you wish for. Good-bye idiot husband. Hello porn!

THE GIRL NEXT DOOR follows Stacy around for her romp in porn and her alleged retirement (whether the retirement worked out, I cannot say). Although interesting, it suffers the same disadvantage as all other movies and books of this type, specifically that the subject herself, as well as those attracted to the same field, are not exactly geniuses of introspection. Stacy seems likeable and we all wish her the best. But she also comes off as painfully immature and more than a wee bit self-centered. In an environment in which her looks meant her business, perhaps it is no surprise that Stacy seems more often focused on herself rather than others, and more concerned with her appearance than something deeper. But whatever the cause, the end result is the same.

Too bad, because, again, she does seem rather nice as a regular person. At times, we see that side come out. Her scenes with her mom in particular display some evidence of an inner life. That side, though, remains hidden (non-existent?) to those outside that exceptionally small circle.

THE GIRL NEXT DOOR takes a more sympathetic angle when examining its subject (probably a necessity if the director wanted any cooperation from his star). One cannot help but smile when Stacy wins her award for being some Best Porn Star, or something like that, and sleeps with the trophy on the pillow next to her. If she is in a field that strains someone's emotions to the core, at least she got her recognition.

The fact of the matter is that, given the insular nature of the porn world, and the no doubt difficult to penetrate inner circle of porn stars, it is near impossible to make a fully well-rounded documentary on one of the genre's stars. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is about as good as it is going to get, and it is not bad at that.",1260835200,31,2201,4.679586563307494

The Girl Next Door is a solid documentary that profiles the immoral, pathetic, and corrupt existence of a mentally unstable porn star.",1236470400,5,559,11.444444444444445
2423441,3,B000BKXAGA,"Stacy Valentine is a small town girl from Oklahoma who leaves her unhappy marriage to pursue a career in the adult industry. This doc alternates between scenes of her life as a porn star and aspects of her personal life, such as her on and off rocky relationship with a male porn actor.

Stacy comes across as a nice but neurotic young woman with serious emotional issues related to men, body image and trust. In other words, she is exactly the type of person who does not belong in the adult industry. But, on the other hand, she does manage to turn her 4 year stint in the porn biz into alot of money and an apparently lucrative career as a fashion designer. So it's difficult to feel too sorry for her.

In the end, Stacy seems to be a girl of average intelligence who (outside of her work) has fairly conventional values and leads a rather ordinary, even mundane, lifestyle. Personally I find someone like Nina Hartley, who views sex work not just as a job but a means of personal liberation, to be a more compelling subject than a regular gal like Stacy.

The story is at least intriguing enough to hold my interest. But Christine Fugate is a mediocre director and the editing is lousy. Basically, the film skips from scene to scene with no particular purpose. The soundtrack is lame and the plastic surgery footage is gory to the point of being unwatchable. A few scenes are mildly erotic. But if you are seeking out this film solely for it's sexual content then you should look elsewhere.

This isn't a terrible film. But, for me, it was far too ordinary.",1211328000,24,1562,4.48943661971831
2423442,5,B000BKXAGA,"Stacy is a nice girl. i felt compassion for her as i watched the emotional rollercoaster she clung to ever since she was a little girl.

as this documentary proceeded i started to have an unsettling feeling in my stomach that this was going to turn into one of those unhappy endings where another adult actress takes their life or murdered or some other horrible outcome.

thankfully Stacy survived and retired from 'the business' and is now a talent scout for Penthouse magazine.

one of the central story arcs of her life as revealed in this documentary is her relationship with a man who also works in the adult film world.

i was rooting for them to live happily ever after but after one too many break-ups they call it quits for good.

the examination of how and why their relationship was not to be is sad but enlightening-enabling Stacy to look into herself for the answer.

i'm hoping Stacy is now a happier and less-lonely person.",1165017600,6,939,4.592814371257485
2423443,4,B000BKXAGA,"Lots of twists and turns in this story (as told by Stacy Valentine and her friends). It might be exaggerated in places, but it most definitely has the ring of truth. Small town beauty is urged by her husband to pose for Hustler magazine; money and attention draw her away from the small town and hubby; wealth and fame don't bring her happiness, etc. The big difference here is that Ms Valentine was a sex worker who tired of the complexity and got out. The point which most impressed me was a reminder that consensual sex work is NOT the same thing as sex trafficking (non-consensual sex work). Adult movies border on prostitution and both are legal in countries where logic, reason and sanity are involved in community decision making.",1444867200,,737,4.676923076923077
