8550986,4,B00AFLTT74,"Starts off by telling us that scientist predicts that the coral reefs will be gone by 2050. Important to have responsible tourism.

Several places visited:
1. Lizard Island, designed around nature. Off of this island is where you can see the Potato Cod. Coral Reefs are like underwater cities.
Some political speech in this section!

2. Wilson Island, turtle hotspot. Only 12 people allowed on the island at one time.

3. Heron Island which is in an atoll. When you land on Heron Island you have to attend a compulsory nature brief. There are hundreds of thousands of birds on this island most of which are not bothered by the sight of humans. The wreck of HMS Protector is close to the island. This island used to have a sea turtle soup factory and then became a place to ride the turtles. In 1943 the island was made a turtle reserve. No turtle riding allowed now! Interesting to see the turtle lay her eggs and then later to see the hatchlings all scurrying down to the shore.

Quite a bit of talk about climate change.

We watched this as a part of our homeschool week long study on oceans and coral reefs. Some beautiful filming.",1392249600,,1134,4.512195121951219
