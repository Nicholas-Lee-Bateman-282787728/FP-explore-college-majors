8190276,5,B000PC0TPY,"We were on vacation in southern Germany two years ago, and were watching TV in our rooms on a Tuesday night when the Rosenheim cops show came on.  I loved the show because the actors speak the local dialect, and the episodes take place in and around the area we stayed.  many scenes are filmed at the City Hall in Rosenheim, where my nephew works, and others depict scenes at two local lakes in the region.  There are usually not so many murders in the area, but the main two detectives have fun solving the crimes.  The series should be a learning tool for any class in America that teaches German.
