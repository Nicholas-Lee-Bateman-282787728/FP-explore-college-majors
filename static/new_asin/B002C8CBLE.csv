8425329,5,B002C8CBLE,The editorial comment attached to this is for a completely different film.  This is a moving story of a villager who brings his grandson who is losing his sight to see a big city doctor.  The news is not good.  The grandfather is overwhelmed by the chaotic atmosphere of the medical system compared to the slower and more caring pace of his village.  A real tear jerker and a worthy entry for best foreign language Oscar.,1393459200,,421,4.5
