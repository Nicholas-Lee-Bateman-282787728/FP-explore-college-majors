6577932,4,B00MHIKRXS,Excellent movie. Enjoyed every minute of it but it's sad the packaging was too cheesy. 20th century fox should come up with an idea to make it looks exclusive. Two discs in cheap packaging. Come on Fox!,1414627200,,202,4.486486486486487
6577933,3,B00MHIKRXS,"Have any of you had the difficulties I have had with the menu on the10th Anniversary Kingdom of Heaven?
I have a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 blu-ray player. No matter what you do when you first insert the disc, it asks you if you want to resume playback. It will either let you select or if you simply ""arrow"" over to No, it boots you right into the Main or Top menu.
The choices across the bottom are Play, Setup, Search and Extras. When you select Play, the three film versions are available. When you select setup, only audio and subtitle choices are there.
When you select Extras, the commentary choices for the Road Show appear along with the Theatrical Pilgrim text info choices. The menu allows you to select the Theatrical text choice Yes or No BUT, you can try to select any of the Road Show commentaries until the cows come home, with no success. For this reason, I thought it was defective.
Then I tried selecting one of the film versions first (the Road Show) which began to play and then bringing up the Popup or overlay menu. Wonder of wonders: the commentary choices now let me select Yes or No!
BUT if you go back to the Main menu, Play no longer displays ANY choices but Play. Now, if you select Setup,  film choices suddenly appear along with the audio but only the other two film versions than the one you previously picked (which makes sense). It's imperative that you make your film version selection first or none of the commentaries will function; there's just no response.
I've never seen a menu like this where three film versions are lumped together under the Play function and the commentaries are listed but can't be selected until the film is; very confusing at first.",1413849600,3,1690,4.559210526315789

6577935,5,B00MHIKRXS,"With the choice of standard movie release or the Director's cut made this exciting.
the Director's cut provides a lot of question you may have from watching the standard release.
That least it did for me .. Money well spent",1413072000,13,223,4.6
6577936,5,B00MHIKRXS,"Just got this in the mail today - IT IS THE CORRECT 2-DISC VERSION with all 3 cuts of the film (Disc 1) and a huge special features disk (Disc 2).  This is the best and most complete release of this film to date, and absolutely the one to buy.",1413072000,33,243,3.86
6577937,5,B00MHIKRXS,"The Director's Cut of KOH turns a slightly above average film into an absolute masterpiece (a term I do not use lightly). KOH Director's Cut is one of my all time favorite films. Some people criticize the film for being anti- Christian. I say those critics are narrow minded and see only what they want to see. KOH painstakingly shows the religious divide between true, devout believers AND those who use religion as a means to achieve their own fanatical (and often insidious) agendas. KOH paints a realistic portrait of religion as a driving influence among the common man in all walks of life - from the lost and forlorn to the to the fanatical, power-hungry and politically motivated, demonstrating how religion brings out the best in some people AND the worst in others. The movie draws a sharp distinction between ""religion"" (man-made, easily corruptible and potentially shallow) versus ""true faith"" (understanding the will of God by seeking to know Him).

KOH uses the holy wars (Crusades) as a backdrop to examine the parallels that exists today with religious extremism, and it does so extremely well. Any astute viewer will easily draw comparisons between the film and real life events taking place today, and how religion at the political level is often used as propaganda to promote war and the profitable rewards that come with it. There is a scene in the movie when the Templars demand war because ""God Wills It!"" The same argument is being made today by politicians and radio / television pundits. I think it's a big point the movie is trying to drive home.

The movie serves as enjoyable entertainment, but it also goes much deeper than that: KOH is a similar to a Biblical parable, and the major character (Balian, played by Orlando Bloom) resembles any number of characters from scripture whose faith is put to the test. Suffering from the stillborn death of his son and the suicide of his wife, Balian is declared a heretic by the local church in the attempt to drive him from the village and claim up his property. The movie follows Balian's character arc as he goes from questioning God's purpose in his life to fulfilling that purpose by the film's end. The film also begs to ask whether or not the hand of God can be ""seen"" (so to speak) throughout the entire film, moving and guiding Balian along his chosen path (i.e., being the sole survivor of the shipwreck, etc). In other words, is the supernatural present throughout the movie? This is left to the viewer's interpretation.

For this reason (and others) I find the film to be incredibly deep and thought-provoking. There are scenes filled with symbolism that are simply poetic (such as when Balian grabs the crucifix from the priest's neck and it scorches his hand). The musical score is tremendous and adds emotional heft and gravitas to key scenes throughout. There are plenty of thought-provoking quotes interspersed throughout the film, mostly by characters who truly seek peace because they believe it is what God demands:

King Baldwin (Edward Norton): ""When you stand before God, you cannot say, ""But I was told by others to do thus,"" or that virtue was not convenient at the time. This will not suffice. Remember that.""

Hospitaller (David Thewlis) ""I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of God. Holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness. What God desires is here [points to head] and here [points to heart] and what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man - or not.""

Village Bishop: ""A law can go too far. I ask myself, `would Jesus do it thusly?' There is so much done in Christendom of which Christ would be incapable""

Not all is perfect with KOH: I didn't think the romantic subplot between Balian and Sibylla added anything to the movie. The sexy subplot just seemed too contrived and out of place for a movie that wants to deal with much heavier themes. However, while I thought the romance was unnecessary, the positives far outweigh the negatives.

There are three versions of the film on this Blu Ray: the theatrical version (approx. 2 hrs. 25 mins.), the director's cut (approx 3 hrs. 5 mins.), and the ""road show"" version, which is the director's cut with an added musical overture and intermission (approx. 3 hrs. 10 mins) which gives the movie that grand, epic feeling that encompassed so many of the classics of old like Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur, El Cid, etc.). All three versions of the disc, along with director's commentaries for each version, are on 1 disc. The second disc contains all the documentaries and other special features.",1412726400,159,4700,4.758282208588957
6577938,5,B00MHIKRXS,"I saw this movie ten years ago when it came out and I was underwhelmed. You never really had a feeling of any of the characters' motivations. This extended version however, felt like an entirely different movie and was far more enjoyable for it.

This tenth anniversary edition comes with two discs. Disc one is the three versions of the movie: theatrical, director's cut, and the directors cut roadshow.

The roadshow version is essentially the same as the director's cut with an introduction by Ridley Scott, followed by a 3 minute overture, and an intermission coupled with a entr'acte. Apparently movies and plays used to have an intermission with a musical break separating acts 2 and 3, a forgotten tradition. I found it very interesting and enjoyable (and unique!) that there was a musical opening prior to the start of the film and a musical break in the middle.

There is also commentary by Ridley Scott and Orlando Bloom (among others). Disc 2 has a full length making of featurette along with many other bonus features.

6577954,5,B00MHIKRXS,"This movie is obviously not for everyone, especially the director's cut. It is a historical epic about the Crusades that runs in excess of 3 hours, so if that doesn't sound like something you would be interested in, then don't watch it. It is however one of the most beautiful historical epics ever filmed, in classic Ridley Scott fashion. It is nearly on par with Lawrence of Arabia which I consider to be the holy grail of all epics visually and otherwise.

As he often does with a great many of his films, Scott imbues a sense of fantasy and reality, making you feel unequivocally that you are indeed in the Middle Ages. The story is very well told and it's characters classical archetypes, the acting is very sincere and fitting from many actors you will recognize as their appearance in other period films. The set pieces are so incredible they are almost unimaginable at times.",1510876800,4,883,4.660256410256411

6577959,5,B00MHIKRXS,"Uncut version much better than 'theatrical version.'  The studio demanded that they cut about 45 min from the final movie to 'speed up the pace.'  Apparently, the studio heads think we're too stupid to pay attention for 3 whole hours.  The problem is that when you dumb down your input, your audience WILL begin to reflect that.  Public education anyone?",1506902400,,354,4.85
6577960,3,B00MHIKRXS,"Originally released in 2005, Kingdom Of Heaven was widely panned by critics and audiences, and rightly so. The theatrical version suffers from a lack of motivation for one character in particular, and the person in question comes across as sterile and two dimensional. That is just one of many problems plaguing the 144 minute release. All that has been rectified for the 189 (and 194 Roadshow Version) Director's Cut. The Director's Cut packs more meat onto the skeletal structure of the film, and is, in my opinion, the definitive cut of the picture, though it could have been better. (More on that below in my third paragraph).

As of this writing, I have only seen the Pilgrim's Guide and Enginer's Guide from the special features, and they are both invaluable sources of information regarding the history behind the events in the film and on the making of the movie itself. My only complaint is that several items on both Guides are on screen for only five to ten seconds, requiring the viewer to rewind more than once to look at the on-screen text. I will update this review when I can.

My reason for the three star rating is for the lack of Jews in the movie, which is ironic, given the plot and setting of the movie. Only Christians and Saracens are depicted in Jerusalem, and no Christians are ever really shown praying unto the one true God whereas the Saracens are shown indulging in their silly heretical 'prayers' more than once and they are never referred to as Moslems, which was one of several ways Medieval Christians referred to those people at that period in history; their name is pronounced as is generally done now, which is a huge anachronism.

(SPOILER WARNING!!! Balian is dead wrong in his speech before the Saracens lay siege to Jerusalem in the film's final act. Only the Jews and Christians have claim to Jerusalem; the Saracens have NONE. SPOILER OVER!!!)

Having said that, I like the film, and recommend both the Theatrical Version and Director's Cut Roadshow Version, though I would have liked to see more of Reynald and Guy killing those filthy heathens than is shown in both versions of the movie. Skip the regular Director's Cut which omits the Overture and Entr'Acte of the Roadshow Version.

Kingdom Of Heaven is rated R for strong violence and epic warfare. To the film's credit, the Names of Elohim and Yeshua are not ta'en in vain, and there is no profanity of any kind. There is a sex scene that is slightly extended in the Director's Cut, but no nudity in both versions.",1506470400,,2514,4.704545454545454

6577983,5,B00MHIKRXS,"Kingdom of Heaven: Ultimate Edition is the Blu-ray version of Ridley Scotts epic historical drama about the Crusades. The film Kingdom of Heaven, which was released worldwide in 2005, features an impressive array of stars that includes Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, Marton Czokas, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, and Michael Sheen. It tells the story of an impoverished French blacksmith who discovers his heritage and rises from obscurity to become the defender of Jerusalem during the Crusades of the twelfth century CE.

The first time I watched Kingdom of Heaven, I saw the original theatrical release. I thought it was middling fare at best, and rather confusing and difficult to follow in places. I didn't consider it among Ridley Scotts better directorial efforts  certainly nowhere near as good as Black Hawk Down,"" which I considered (at that time) his very best film.

Then, in early 2006, I discovered Kingdom of Heaven: 4-Disc Directors Cut on DVD.  It restored everything that Scott had originally intended to be in the film, but had cut for the theatrical release at the studios insistence. The Directors Cut is a truly magnificent epic film that fills in all of the gaps left behind in the shorter theatrical version. This three hour long expanded version tells the complete story of Balian of Ibelin, restores a wonderful story arc involving Queen Sibylla and her son, and adds or extends many other scenes that transform the film from so-so action-hero fare into the grand and glorious sweeping epic that Ridley Scott always wanted it to be.

This Blu-ray Ultimate Edition certainly lives up to its ultimate billing. It reduces everything onto only two Blu-ray discs (BDs). Disc 1 contains the original theatrical release, the directors cut originally released to DVD, and, as an added bonus,  the Directors Cut Roadshow Edition that was eventually released to theaters.  Disc 1 also includes several commentaries by Scott and other members of the cast and crew. Disc 2 contains all of the bonus content (over three hours worth) included in the 4-DVD set, plus additional special features. The 1080p high definition video and the DTS-HD multi-channel audio quality on both BDs are first-rate.

It all adds up to wonderful entertainment on one of the best Blu-ray releases of any film in my Blu-ray library. Most highly recommended.",1496534400,4,2358,5.090673575129534

6577993,5,B00MHIKRXS,"The Film's Historical Background:

The movie opens in France, 1184 AD. Knights of the Second Crusade (11471149), pursuing the Roman Catholic Church's holy war against Islam, had captured the city of Jerusalem and established a Christian kingdom. A fragile peace was in effect, through the cooperative efforts of Jerusalem's enlightened ""Leper King,"" Baldwin IV (11611185), and the ""Saracen"" (non-Arab Muslim) sultan, Salah ad-Din (""Saladin,"" 11371193).

Saladin was a Kurdish Sunni Muslim of the Ayyubid Dynasty, who led the military campaigns against the Crusaders in the Levant (countries surrounding the eastern Mediterranean Sea). At the time of Saladin's death, the Ayyubid Sultanate had conquered Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen, and other parts of North Africa.

In 1174, Jerusalem-born King Baldwin IV had gained fame at the age of 13 by successfully attacking Damascus, drawing Saladin away from his assault on Aleppo. Two years later, Baldwin organized a campaign against Saladin's power-base in Egypt, defeating the Saracens at the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. The Egyptian army had been commanded by Saladin's nephew, Taqi ad-Din. Saladin made his escape to Egypt on a racing camel, with only a tenth of his army surviving. As a result of Baldwin's subsequent victories at Belvoir castle, Beirut, and Kerak castle, Saladin's campaigns in the Holy Land came to a halt.

The Knights Templar (France and England, red cross on white) were frequently at odds with the other two Catholic military orders in the Holy Land, the Knights Hospitaller (Rhodes and Malta, white cross on red), and the Teutonic Knights (Germany and Italy, black cross on white). Decades of internecine feuds weakened the competing Knights' positions, both politically and militarily.

The peace was constantly threatened by Raynald de Chtillon, who controlled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. He was the only Christian noble to pursue a purely offensive policy against the Muslims, plundering peaceful Muslim caravans on land with his army, and with a fleet of five ships on the Red Sea. His armies also massacred Muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca, enraging Saladin.

After Raynald attacked a Muslim caravan in 1186, claiming that the truce between Saladin and Baldwin did not bind him, Saladin proclaimed a jihad against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, vowing to personally behead Raynald for breaking the truce.

In 1187, Saladin destroyed Raynald's army in the Battle of Hattin. Raynald was captured on the battlefield, and Saladin made good on his vow, saying, ""It is not the won't of kings to kill kings, but that man had transgressed all bounds, and therefore did I treat him thus. This man was only killed because of his maleficence and perfidy."" Guy de Lusignan, made King of Jerusalem the year before, had joined forces with Raynald. He was taken captive by Saladin and held prisoner until 1189.

After ordering the beheading of 200 captured Templar and Hospitaller Knights, Saladin laid siege to Jerusalem. The city was valiantly defended by Balian de Ibelin (11431193), but fell in ten days. After collecting a large ransom, Saladin permitted an orderly departure of the city's survivors. Holding back his troops, he prevented the massacre of civilians that had occurred when the First Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099.

In 1189, King Richard the Lionheart of England led the Third Crusade. He was joined by King Philip II of France and Guy de Lusignan. Failing to regain Jerusalem, the crusade ended in 1192 after reaching an uneasy truce with Saladin. Jerusalem did not return to Western control until 1917, when the British captured it from the Ottoman Turks in World War I. Today, peace in the Kingdom of Heaven remains elusive.

The Film's Artistic License:

Godfrey de Ibelin, cast as Balian's biological father, is a purely fictional character created for the movie. Balian's actual father was Barisan de Ibelin, a knight in service to the Count of Jaffa. Ibelin was a crusader castle, located between Jaffa and Ascalon, built in 1141 by King Fulk of Jerusalem, as a gift to Barisan.

The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. After the fall of Jerusalem, the kingdom was ruled from Acre (today a Mediterranean port on the northern coast of Israel). Acre was destroyed in 1291 by the Mamluks (Muslim slave soldiers).

Balian de Ibelin (aka Barisan the Second) was a nobleman of legitimate parentage, not a blacksmith. One of five children, he married the widow Maria Comnena, who had been the second wife of King Amalric the First of Jerusalem, and was the mother of Queen Isabella of Jerusalem. Maria bore Balian at least four children, who lived into adulthood. She did not live in France, nor did she commit suicide.

In 1192, Balian commanded the rearguard of King Richard's army at the Battle of Jaffa. Later, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ramla between Richard and Saladin, ending the Third Crusade. While Ibelin remained under Saladin's control, many other sites along the coast were allowed to remain in Christian hands. After King Richard departed, Saladin compensated Balian with the castle of Caymont and five other nearby sites, all outside Acre.

Sibylla, sister of King Baldwin IV, was the Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon. As the wife of Guy de Lusignan, she became the Queen of Jerusalem in 1186. She died at the age of 30 during the Siege of Acre in 1190. She did not have an affair with Balian de Ibelin, nor did she go with him to France after the fall of Jerusalem in 1187. Balian was actually joined by his wife and children in Tripoli.

Knight Templar, Guy de Lusignan, while serving as Regent to the King, overlooked Raynald de Chtillon's misdeeds. Guy became King of Jerusalem in 1186, by right of his marriage to the widowed Princess Sibylla. Sibylla had a son, named Baldwin, from her first marriage. Guy and Sibylla remained loyal to each other throughout the course of their marriage, and had two daughters. Guy de Lusignan remained King of Jerusalem until 1192, ruling from Acre after his release by Saladin. He died in 1194 while ruling from Cyprus.

Baldwin IV deposed Guy as Regent in 1183, and had Sibylla's son crowned as his co-king, Baldwin V. When Baldwin IV died in 1185, Baldwin V ruled until his own death the following year, apparently not poisoned nor diagnosed with leprosy.",1491004800,5,6427,5.036723163841808

6578024,5,B00MHIKRXS,"This 10th Anniversary edition of Ridley Scott's Kingdom Of Heaven includes multiple new features that were never published before on DVD or Blu-ray. With 2 discs, there are about 9 hours of bonus features, including documentaries on the production of the movie, some history lessons about the elements included in the film, and a biography of Orlando Bloom. But the real reason of why you should buy this disc is for the extended version. Disc 1 includes 3 versions of the movie: the regular version (theatrical), the extended version (director's cut), and the extended version with an orchestral overture and intermission (roadshow). I know very well the theatrical version as it is the one I owned on DVD before. I haven't watched the roadshow version yet, simply because I don't really like the concept of overtures and intermissions.

The extended version is the first version I watched on Blu-ray, and it is not disappointing. It feels to me like when I watched The Lord of the Rings extended versions: all the scenes bring more value to the film, and the whole universe of the movie makes more sense. For example, I always wondered what happened to Guy after he was captured. The extended  version reveals that he was released, and he fights Balian in Jerusalem after the city is surrendered. Some of the other additional scenes include the appearance of Balian's wife at the beginning of the movie, and the story of the young child who should have been king of Jerusalem, two moments which I think are really important to watch if one wants to understand the story line better.

About the quality, the Blu-ray image and sound make this movie more intense, especially during the Jerusalem siege. The quality is perfect. I had a fullscreen version of the movie on DVD, so I am happy with this widescreen edition since I do not have to adjust the screen size anymore. This is definitely the version of the movie you should own.",1464739200,,1931,4.792792792792793

6578033,5,B00MHIKRXS,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  You need to read the history to fully understand all the players.  Ridley Scott belongs in the pantheon of truly epic directors along with David Lean and Stanley Kubrick.  It is action packed, allegorical and instructive.  There will never be ""peace"" in the middle east.  It has been and always be a land of intrigue, conquest and ""restoration"" to the land of our forebears.  That was the story of the Crusades.  It is thus today.  No less a monumental epic as Gladiator.  All accounts that it was a box office failure only show no relationship between popularity and genius.  Shakespeare was not widely acclaimed in his time.  Now go watch this Homeric epic.",1460246400,,704,4.688524590163935

6578043,5,B00MHIKRXS,"First off, Kingdom of Heaven the Directors Cut is an amazing film which you likely already know and many of you reading this have probably seen the movie many times and are wondering how this re-release fares. Many people have written great reviews regarding the content of the movie and they are much better writers than I so I am going to mainly comment on other things about the Blu-ray.
For many years, the majority of the behind the scenes features and bonuses were not available on Blu-ray. They were only available on the DvD 4 disc special edition (which I own and its an amazing collectors edition). Well with this Ultimate/Anniversary Edition (my cover art says Ultimate edition rather then Anniversary), you get the original cut of the film, a roadshow version (which adds a short introduction by Ridley Scott and some intermission breaks like old school films had) and all of the previously released special features from the Director's Cut DVD and the Theatrical Cut DVDs.
There is a huge amount of behind the scenes stuff regarding all aspects of the film which they made into a 2.5 hour long documentary and there is even more than that. It is very interesting if you are into that type of thing.
The movie looks and sounds amazing in 1080p and 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio. The documentary and other special features are in SD quality unfortunately, though they do look a bit better here than they did on the DVD version.",1455235200,3,1432,4.709163346613546

6578051,5,B00MHIKRXS,"I know it's a kitschy, snoozy, redundant bore to a lot of folks, but I think this is a fantastic film. Edward Norton's uncredited role as the leper King Baldwin deserves much praise, as does Orlando Bloom as Balian. As a historian, sure... some of the details really get under my skin. That said, the divided nature of the relatively peaceful City-Kingdom of Jerusalem is well established, and I must give the production team praise for their portrayal of individuals from each ""side"" of the conflict - Balian as the true believer in the holiness of Jerusalem and the need for members of all faiths to share the city in fraternal fashion, Guy de Lusignan and his ilk as agents provocateurs intent on destroying Christian-Muslim diplomatic and economic relations in order to foment conflict, and Salah ad-Din - the wise commander of the Army of Islam - whose passions rest equally on both ends of the emotional spectrum.

I highly recommend this movie. Watch it, then learn the true history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. This is a fascinating period of time in medieval European-Middle Eastern history, and it should be known to all.",1447545600,,1131,4.829896907216495

From what I've heard about it I'm not surprised -- Sibylla's son wasn't even in it, apparently, and that was so important a subplot that I can't even imagine the movie making sense without it.

This new edition includes the Theatrical, Director's, and new Roadshow Cut. The Roadshow Cut is identical in terms of content to the Director's Cut, but adds a couple of overture (music sequences with no picture) like in movies of old. The soundtrack is beautiful so it's well worth it if you've never owned any version in the past (and I got it despite owning the Director's Cut!).

Also to note, this new release has a new, sharper/cleaner AVC video encode, versus the older Director's Cut Blu-ray release which is MPEG2. The difference isn't staggering, but it's something else to push you over the edge if you're thinking of upgrading.

Overall, I really like this movie. My recommendation is to completely skip the Theatrical Cut, and watch the Roadshow version. Grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy. This is cinema at some of its finest.

6578102,5,B00MHIKRXS,"I'm going to speak on the PQ of this new 10th Anniversary release.  The PQ on this new release is a big step up from the previous original 2006 release.  First of all, it's now an MPEG-4 AVC encode over the old [DVD] MPEG-2 encode.  The difference?  The digital noise has been virtually eliminated.  Only in a few select shots can you detect it, and that depends on your player's Picture settings.  The AQ is about the same I think.

Perhaps the greatest improvement for this release is the inclusion of all the DVD extras that was included on the 4-disc DVD Director's Cut set from 2005.  So you can retire that set if you'd like.  This is just a 2-disc set...one disc includes all 3 cuts of the film, TC, DC, and Roadshow DC, which includes 4 extra minutes from the DC.  Not sure what those 4 minutes are, but I'm thinking that it's the Musical intro and Intermission pieces.  I could be wrong, but I don't recall the regular DC having those.  I Give this release 5-stars for the film itself, being one of the greatest Medieval films ever made and the inclusion of the DVD extras and the improved PQ over the original release.",1424649600,65,1128,4.396135265700483

Given that the bonus materials were created right around the same time that Blu-ray came out, I assumed that they were all created in and would be presented in HD now that they have finally been brought to Blu-ray.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.

Excellent movie, and excellent extras.  I just wish the extras didn't look so bad.  Still, it is at least good to finally be able to watch the phenomenal commentary with HD picture quality (instead of having to watch the DVD).",1421798400,2,787,4.785185185185185

Some motivations were missing for certain characters, while others did not make sense at all. This Ultimate Edition ties everything together neatly, and, in my opinion, perfectly. I apologize for being vague, but I do not wish to spoil anything. All I will say, however, is that I cannot believe that Scott was forced to take out a part of his movie that made everything make so much more sense!

If you have seen the original theatrical version of this movie, and felt that it left a bad taste in your mouth, pick this up. If you've never seen the original theatrical, watch it first, then watch the extended version. It is worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed going through the extended cut with the original theatrical fresh in my memory to see the wonderful changes and additions.
