7897329,4,630588921X,"this is without a doubt one of the most entertaining kung fu

kook films ever made! I mean not only is this movie

entertaining, but also the movie does have a surprisingly good &

easy to follow story. the movie is about this guy who is on a

mission to kill these band of thiefs for stealing the King's

gold with a group of warriors while ""Beardie"" is on the hunt for

a White-haired taoist priest! Eventually they meet and the movie

turns into a lust for revenge and blah blah blah! The final

fight scene from when the two main heroes fight these soldiers

to the fight with taoist priest who can shoot lazers out the

palm of his hand was easily the best kung fu scene ever! The FX

was very cheezy but fun!

DVD: The picture quality is bad! The movie has this faded blue

flame that appears almost throughout the film! It's very

noticable in the night scenes and somewhat noticeable in the day

scenes! like maybe 5 times of the film there's heavy scratches

and the picture is faded! But since this film was so good, I

hardly noticed! The film is in widescreen with in Chinese with

english and Mandarin subtitles that cut off sometimes! Extras is

some Tae Kwon Do instrutional thing!",1136505600,2,1196,4.378995433789954
