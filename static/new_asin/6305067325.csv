7881859,4,6305067325,"Revised update of a clever silent film.  Dennis O'Keefe is excellent throughout and hysterically funny!  Fine performance turns by Barry Sullivan and
Marie McDonald as well.  Fast-paced throughout and amusing from scene-to-scene.  The films has very, very few dull moments and is a mad dash
towards laughs and more laughs.  Highly recommended as an antedote for a boring, routine or uneventful day.  This one will definitely perk you up!",1424736000,,437,5.260869565217392
7881860,5,6305067325,"This is going to sound corny but - I saw this movie and Up in Mable's Room when I was in grade school. My TV was going to the  movies with my mom or myself on Saturdays to see the Westerns of the time.

The movie was innocent and funny. The whole family could watch these types of movies; they were also morale builders as they were shown at the time of World War II. A lot of families needed a lift and a laugh with many sons and fathers away from home.

Laughed like I did when I was young and loved Dennis O'Keefe in these parts.",1378166400,,532,3.9074074074074074
7881861,5,6305067325,"I saw this movie on the late late show in the late 60's after returning from a night of drinking many beers.  Not sure the title is correct, but it must be, how many movies have the words, ""Gertie"" & ""Garter"" in the title?

Wasn't ready for sleep, so flipped the TV on.  The first 5 minutes, i was rolling my eyes thinking, ""This is the stupidest movie ever.""  Exactly at the 5 minute mark this slapstick comedy overtook my sensibilities and i was rolling on the floor laughing hysterically, literally.  And i couldn't stop.  I tried desperately to stop laughing, but it didn't work.  As soon as I gained composure, another outrageous scene came on.

From what I remember, a fourty's scientist had locked away in a safe (in his laboratory) a garter he had caught at a wedding years ago, which he lusted over.  but he must keep it a secret from his wife, or it would mean scandal.  The garter becomes missing.  Every member of the very large cast steals it from it's former holder.  Each character has different motives; some want to return it to the scientist, some want to expose him to his wife, some want to blackmail the scientist, on and on.  The action never stops & each one is outrageous.  There are no limits the cast will go to obtain this precious garter, even if only for a moment.  Daring feats and bad behavior are showcased in a somewhat formal and moral weekend gathering at a country home.  Deceit, gossip, and inuendo rule here.

I have been searching for this movie all my life, now, i have to buy it.",1319673600,4,1520,4.4296028880866425
7881862,4,6305067325,"I saw this movie when I was 15 or 16 yrs.of age. I am now on the very foggy side of 70 and am wondering if this is really the movie I have been searching and waiting (to be available) for the last 10 yrs ! In my memory it was an extremely funny movie. This does not come out in the 1 review given here.  Am I thinking of another Dennis O""Keefe movie or what? (He was one of my Hollywood favorites).Was this movie plot as funny as remembered or have I grown too jaded with the passing years ? Ah, youth !",1276732800,,503,3.8365384615384617
