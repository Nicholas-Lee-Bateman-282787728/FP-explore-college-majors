Brook's Hamlet is not linear Hamlet. There is no straight forward begining like in all the Hamlets that open with unfold yourself, the Ghost of Hamlet senior walking the roof top /parapet of Elsinore. It is here and there willy-nilly Hamlet to some degree.

The syntax is there it is just rearranged a little.

Checked this first hand when I got this lightning delivery of Brook's Hamlet. The disc is functional. Checked
it in Linux. Precise Pangolin 12.04 with updates. If it works in Linux it works in Windows. Guess the same for Macs I can only assume.

There are only a few left of this icon of Shakespeare. I got the best price. Tough.

The packaging was verysecure. The DVD looks pristine. Well packed in strong as hell tape that was tough to open.",1357776000,,797,4.468965517241379
8051609,4,B0007TKHSO,"This presentation is really two separate presentations. The first is a terrific insight into the ways and thoughts of Peter Brook I Peter Brook. Then in The Tragedy of Hamlet (2002 TV movie) we get to see how Peter Brook actually applies his skills and insights.

In Peter Brook by Peter Brook even if French is not your first language you will need to pay attention to the subtitles in English. This is a stand-alone presentation that gives you an insight to actors and acting and how Peter Brook brings out the best in them.

This presentation of Hamlet is anything but ""...stale, flat, and unprofitable."" However it is picky and choosy as to what parts of the play to show and what parts to skip while mixing cultures. Peter brook is the only parson that can take a play out of original time/space and still hold an audience in awe.

It may be better to watch ""The Tragedy of Hamlet"" first so you won't be picking it apart.
Then after watching the tow presentations, before passing any judgment on Brooks and his work be sure to watch his Mahabharata.",1292112000,,1054,4.536842105263158
8051610,2,B0007TKHSO,Very slow and I suppose clear.  Hamlet may be depressed and indecisive but this seems just hollow.  I know the participants are all terrific.  Actors and director.  But it seems rigid and correct.  Dull.,1255996800,,203,4.852941176470588
8051611,4,B0007TKHSO,"Attempting to capture any theatrical production on film is always a difficult process. Of course, we are not viewing the film in a commercial context but as an audio visual recording of theatre. Even if recorded as television with a multiple camera set up, with multiple takes, and minimum audience participation, we need to understand it as a theatrical recording in this different light. As a theatre lover and Drama teacher, I really appreciate and respect any new resource that attempts to offer an insight into this unique theatrical process.

This companion package of Brook's ""Hamlet"" and the ""Brook on Brook"" documentary is no different. It actually presents an excellent and successful opportunity to study both a significant theatre production and an important theatre practitioner in Peter Brook.

I particular found Brook's Hamlet a moving and emotional performance that encouraged me to discover addition layers of meaning of this familiar play through Brook's interpretation. This Hamlet offers us a pared back view of the play, exploring what is the essence of the tale. There are numerous cuts to the full text that help to facilitate this retelling of the Hamlet fable. More importantly, this Hamlet offers us a practical chance to study how some of Brook's theories and ideas practically manifest within this theatrical/filmic production.

Personally, I loved this chance to get an insight into Brook's theatre brain. If you are a student of theatre rather than  just a shakespeare lover, this DVD package is worth a go!",1191974400,5,1538,5.189516129032258
8051612,3,B0007TKHSO,"This may be a very good example of a Peter Brook production, but I don't think it's a good interpretation of 'Hamlet'.  Too much is cut, and while some sequences have been merely transplanted from their original places, they're too often replaced in contexts where they simply don't make sense.

More distressingly, all of Shakespeare's humor has been stripped from the performance.  The changes of tone in the original provide texture and depth to the play; they're not 'inconsistencies'.  At 134 minutes, it's good that the production is short, because a full three-plus hours of such unrelenting earnestness would have been rough sledding indeed.

This production is apparently famous as 'Peter Brook's ""Hamlet""', which I suppose is appropriate because it's not quite Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'...",1136505600,23,796,5.387096774193548
8051613,4,B0007TKHSO,"I've studied Peter Brook for years.  I find his methods fascinating.  I love his Mahabaharata.

In Hamlet, Peter Brook pares down the play to its essentials.  It makes for a very quiet, meditative look at Hamlet, the character, which allows us to explore him deeper than a more flamboyant portrayal.  Adrian Lester does an excellent job.

In Brook by Brook, we catch a small glimpse of Brook as a person.  The documentary doesn't capture him as his books do, but it still educates the viewer on a most innovative individual.",1127088000,11,524,4.7555555555555555
