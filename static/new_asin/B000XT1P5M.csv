3006235,2,B000XT1P5M,"The original title of this bleak flim - WHEN A MAN FALLS IN THE FOREST - was inexplicably shortened to the nebulous WHEN A MAN FALLS for the release of the DVD: had the original title been retained, the audience may have been given a clue as to the intended message of the story.  This is the second film for 26-year old writer/director Ryan Eslinger and it does suggest that he wants to deal with some existential material, but he has a way to grow into how to make it happen.

The lives of three men and a woman are interconnected in the all too common shallow 'relationships' that are a major problem in how our society is working.  Bill (Dylan Baker) is a night janitor in a large company, a man who shuts out the boring world with his earphones connected to the great opera classics: he avoids people including those who saunter past him and those whose chaotic lives in the next door apartment distress him. Gary Fields (Timothy Hutton) is a down and out professional man who works in the building that Bill nocturnally keeps tidy, the two 'old high school acquaintances' meeting only because Gary has taken to sleeping in the office. Gary's wife Karen (Sharon Stone, without makeup and looking spent and used) has lost all feeling for living, detests Gary, and finds her only joy is in shoplifting.  Gary has shut himself off from old friends for reasons that seem to be related to an accident that involved is best friend Travis (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a man at odds with his own environment. The only apparent connection here is that, once Gary discovers that Bill is a night janitor,  Gary and Travis feel guilty that their response to Bill in high school had been one of cruel ridicule.  Each of the four main characters wanders aimlessly through a world that has become strange and vindictive and it is only a bizarre incident that throws the quartet into some semblance of meaning.  Each person has fallen, but since they are in the midst of a lonely 'forest', has anyone noticed or cared?

This could be a study in personal tragedy were it done better, but despite the fine credentials of the actors, the script is so full of holes that character development suffers and what results is not unlike watching an injured bull struggling around a bullfight ring as the crowd attends to the matador et al. Sadly we just don't care about these damaged people, making connection with the film next to impossible. Maybe next film...Grady Harp, February 08",1203120000,17,2460,4.639080459770115

3006237,3,B000XT1P5M,"""When a Man Falls"" has three central characters. Bill is a shy janitor who works during the nights and only seems to really come alive in his dreams when he's sleeping during the days.

Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on whether you enjoy that type of movies. If you're looking for a movie with a typical plot you may be disappointed. If you like character studies, give it a try. The characters could have been more developed, especially Pruitt Taylor Vince's.

Its about four people stuck in time and circumstance, about the frailty of human relationships, about how we seldom really communicate what needs to be said. All of the performances are startling.

8229578,4,B000XT1P5M,"Though marketed as a Sharon Stone thriller,When A Man Falls revolves around three friends are reunited as their lives become increasingly desperate and dysfunctional. It features Stone together with Dylan Baker, Stacie Bono, Timothy Hutton and Pruitt Taylor Vince. It was written and directed by Ryan Eslinger.

Bill is a lonely middle-aged man who works as a night janitor in a large office building; he keeps himself company at work by listening to opera, and as he tries to sleep through the day he obsessively listens to a self-help tape that teaches ""lucid dreaming."" One of the men working Bill's building is Gary, who has a habit of falling asleep at his desk rather than go home to deal with his loveless marriage to Karen, who is convinced she's losing her looks and turns to shoplifting for comfort. Even though Gary bullied Bill when they were in high school together, when they meet by chance at the office one night Gary is thrilled to see him, and suggests they get together with another fellow classmate, Travis. However, as they spend time together, the three men are only reminded of their emotional isolation, and how their lives have not turned out as they dreamed.

This independent drama moves too slowly to generate suspense, while the characters lack sufficient development for their catharsis to have the desired impact. Despite their efforts, this leaves the actors stranded at times, particularly Baker, whose Bill is too bizarre to inspire much sympathy. Of the leads,only Vince makes the best impression. But nevertheless,it is a gripping film that is sure to keep you guessing until the end.",1433289600,,1620,4.974169741697417

8229580,2,B000XT1P5M,"A good cast struggles valiantly, but ultimately unsuccessfully, with a woefully underwritten script. This character study focuses on four people, probably in their late 30s or early 40s (we really don't know, but the couple has a son who seems to be about 16), who for various reasons are unhappy with themselves, with their lives, and with each other. Unfortunately, since we do not know how any of them arrived at where they are, all we are given is a snapshot in time with no past reference points, which really does not allow the viewer to develop much empathy for any of the characters. If a film is going to be a character study, then the writer needs to provide some background and better-developed characters so the viewer to somehow relate to them. And oh yes - we have another film where after a traumatic event two of the characters miraculously begin to cope with their problems.",1343520000,,891,4.681528662420382
8229581,4,B000XT1P5M,"This is a film for those who like an indie character study.

Gary (Timothy Hutton) works late at night. He may lose his job and go to jail, although he doesn't discuss the matter with his friend or wife. He drinks and take sleeping pills to help him escape life.

Karen (Sharon Stone) is married to Gary. She has passed the ""let's talk about the relationship"" stage and wants to live a separate life. She is depressed about getting old and losing her looks. She resorts to shop lifting to escape boredom.

Bill (Dylan Baker) is the night time janitor. He went to school with Gary and Travis and is a recluse who attempts to live his life in a world of lucid dreaming. His apartment building doesn't afford him that luxury as he is forced to interact with the world.

Travis (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is Gary's old friend. They have recently got back together. Travis likewise is a semi-recluse since his wife died in a car accident.

Sadie (Stacie Bono) is Bill's neighbor who gets into loud fights with her husband. She attempt to makes friends with Bill, who can only fantasize about her.

Will (David Wiliams) is the son of Gary and Karen. We find out about him about two thirds through the story.

The movie is about how people's lives get into ruts that spiral downwards. These downward spirals are connected to each other. In order to break out of it, a drastic measure is required. Acting was good, but this is not a film most people would want to watch.  It is a ""people watcher"" film.

8229582,3,B000XT1P5M,"I purchased this movie, it was rather slow and boring. I ending was rather surprising, oh now remember why I purchased this movie, it was on sale for under $10 dollars.",1302220800,,168,4.451612903225806
8229583,5,B000XT1P5M,"I loved this movie. I didn't come into it with any particular expectations - I bought it because Timothy Hutton was in it and it was on sale at my local Blockbuster. I didn't pay attention to the blurb, and, thankfully, I didn't read the Amazon reviews. I just popped it in the player and was thoroughly entertained for an hour and a half.

This is a slow, complex, well-acted, occasionally surreal, comedy. If it had been in French with English subtitles, perhaps it would not have been so misunderstood. Of course I do agree that the liner notes on the back really don't do the film any justice, but saying the movie has no plot or has bad acting or isn't psychological enough or whatever, just because the reviewer was expecting a completely different movie due to the badly written advertising, is like saying: ""The package said fruit, so I expected an apple because I like apples. What I got instead was a banana, and I hate bananas. This is a horrible excuse for an apple. I'm giving this stupid banana a One Star rating and recommending everyone avoid it.""

In the Amazon Editorial Review, Kathleen C. Fennessy refers to ""A senseless tragedy"". What? Is she meaning the convenience-store scene? Surely not. Anyone who was actually paying attention would know there was nothing senseless or tragic about that! Gary just does what so many of us would wish we were capable of doing, were we to find ourselves in the same situation.

Having now read all these negative reviews I realise I'm going to have to watch this movie again to see if I can figure out just what was so upsetting to those reviewers. I'll be surprised if I can, though.

(Note. I'm giving it the full 5 stars and not deducting anything for the lousy write-up on the packaging because it's the movie itself that I am rating.)",1279065600,6,1797,4.588785046728972
8229584,5,B000XT1P5M,"This DVD is horribly misadvertised as a Psychological Thriller.  This was obviously a pathetic ploy by the DVD distributor to get the DVD off the shelves by any means necessary with no thought to doing the consumer, nor the film any justice.  The result is that people are watching this film with entirely the wrong mindset.

This film is a dramatic look at the lives and relationships (or lack of relationships) of the four main characters.  It is a thought provoking look into what can happen when we allow ourselves to dwell within our personal misery to the point that we can no longer connect to those around us.  The acting, writing, cinematography and direction are excellent, and the film is riddled with beautifully captured momments of life to which so many people can relate.  If you are looking for a shallow sexy thriller, see Basic Instinct or Sliver.  But if you are someone who appreciates the simplistic intracacies of what makes up the soul of a person...this movie is an excellent choice for you.",1231200000,10,1015,4.765714285714286

Sorry, but every movie has the potential to be a good one; but when it is poorly scripted, poorly plotted and poorly acted, it will be a horrible film.  This is a horrible, horrible film, which wanders as aimlessly as its characters.  I seem to be beating a dead horse, but I felt compelled to add my voice to the chorus of those who literally felt cheated by the misrepresentation of what this film aimed to be.
