8293966,3,B000E9X37E,"I only watched number seven of shadow dancers, as it is more in line with my collection of hypnotic paraphernalia including hypnotic poetry. I have to admit this is more fun than crystallomancy; unless her name is Chrystal. The back ground looks like 60's psychedelic.

This makes good background music for resting reading and even hypnotic events. I am sure that was not the original purpose of the DVD. It was designed for more of a party enhancer. Yet shadow dancer volume seven has potential to out sell the other volumes for its uniqueness alone.",1359244800,,551,4.8
