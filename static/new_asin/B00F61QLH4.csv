Because we were interested in this being a true story, about an athlete who ran for India at the Olympics, as well as having an interest in India's history it had a two-fold interest for us. . The inclusion of the details of partition and how the events of the war affected Milka in his past, present and future as a person and in his running was handled very creatively. There was a depth of plot and development of the main character that was fascinating. This is a long movie, for those of us who are not used to Bollywood movies, but well worth watching!",1389225600,,596,4.378378378378378
5968081,5,B00F61QLH4,"Sonam Kapoor looked stunning, farhan akhtar 's acting is really outstanding, he plays a boy whose misfortune causes him to always be running whether it be the law, the turmoil between india and pakistan which is so well captured as the background to his life and his start with running in the army.

  Get this movie to see a 10 performance by Farhan Akhtar",1386720000,,357,4.546875

5968083,4,B00F61QLH4,"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is not a factual rendition about one of India's greatest sporting legends but a film that has taken many liberties with his life and translated them in such a way that everyone can enjoy his achievements and feel proud about his achievements. That means unhealthy doses of melodrama but much of it is real as Milkha Singh did lead a hard life which began with bloodshed as his entire clan including his parents were wiped out during the partition of India and Pakistan. I had no idea about the achievements of this amazing man and his journey from a petty thief living in a refugee camp and his transformation to a super athlete, but still enjoyed the film a lot however I thought there were a few drawbacks that prevented the film from becoming a classic. The length of the film might be a deterrent to many viewers, clocking at almost 188 minutes, this is a very long film. Many of the emotional scenes lacked the heart felt punch that move the audience to euphoria or tears.
Farhan Akhtar is amazing and comes up with a great performance, I think this is the best role he had and he does full justice to it. I hope he gets many more chances like this. Pawan Malhotra is great as well as Milkha's coach

The music is good and Maston Ka Jhund and Slow Motion Angrezza are great
Overall, BMK is a very inspiring film that should be watch but make sure that you have plenty of time on hand when you do. four stars. 7/17/2014",1381190400,3,1442,4.400749063670412

5968098,5,B00F61QLH4,"I saw this movie initially while surfing around on a BA flight from the US to England. It looked interesting. It was a mix of english and ??, so there were subtitles. I thought this was by far the best movie I had seen come out of Bollywood. The acting, cinematography, storyline and music were all top notch. When I saw this movie was available in the US, I had to buy it. My only complaint about this disc is it obviously comes from the India release and 99% of the english is gone, so subtitles are a must for anybody not speaking (??? ... not sure exactly what language it is). For non-native speakers in the US, it would have been nice to release the version they had on the BA flight, but that's just a small thing for such a wonderful movie. In fact, it such a good movie, my spouse who doesn't like to read subtitles sat and watched the whole three hours (oh yes, it's a long movie) and also enjoyed it. That's saying something about this movie.",1414108800,,953,4.241758241758242

5968100,5,B00F61QLH4,"I typically don't watch very many sports themed movies, but this Bollywood drama is one of the best! Based on a true Olympian it is both inspiring and entertaining. Farhan  Akhtar once again proves himself to be one of India's most talented actors not to mention writer, lyricist, director - it runs in the family! He deserved every accolade and award for this outstanding movie. To those who dismiss Bollywood as unsophisticated, cheesy, or second rate, and certainly it can be , I challenge you to watch BhaagMilkha Bhaag (Run Milkha Run), Chak de India or Swades to see quality, well acted, and inspiring film at its best!",1409788800,,625,4.787037037037037
5968101,5,B00F61QLH4,"I absolutely love this film. I think everyone should see it. It's part sports, part dramatic history of 2 countries, Pakistan and India, and part musical. I loved it. Farhan Akhtar is amazing.",1407715200,,192,4.848484848484849
5968102,5,B00F61QLH4,"I started running Track and Cross Country in high school about 25 years ago and my father (who grew up in India in the 1950's) had told me about Milkha Singh. Later when the internet began, I saw an article about Singh and a picture of him. So, to now be able to see a full motion picture about him is truly wonderful. His interviews are also available online.

Milkha Singh is the only Indian to win a Gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Track and Field in an individual event, in history! He accomplished this in 1958, when he won the 400m race. He also won Gold medals at the Asian Games in the 400m and various other international competitions. He also made the final of the 400m at the 1960 Olympics, just missing a medal by 0.1 seconds. His best time for 400m was 45.7 seconds, set in 1960 on a dirt/cinder track and it was the Indian national record for the next 44 years.

His story off the track is just as remarkable. He was born in 1935 (some sources list 1929), in British India. During the India-Pakistan partition in 1947, his family was forced to move from the newly created Pakistan to India. His family refused and were as a result murdered by Islamic militants.

He somehow survived and travelled to India alone with nothing but the clothes he was wearing and his parents blood stains. Struggled to somehow make a living for a few years and then joined the Indian army. It was there that he was introduced to Track and Field.

The movie is based on an autobiographical book written by Milkha Singh and has come to life beautifully with the performance of Farhan Akhtar who plays Milkha Singh. Akhtar got in shape for the movie and plays Singh remarkably well. Akhtar has won the prestigious Indian FilmFare award and the International Indian Film Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for this movie.

Also great in the movie is the actor who plays his coach - Pavan Malhotra. Who I immediately recognized, even though in the movie he is wearing a turban and has a beard. He is really powerful and made me teary eyed a few times with his sentimental and heartfelt role.

In addition to the outstanding acting are the numerous other aspects of the film. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has won nine technical awards at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in the categories of cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, editing, sound design, sound mixing, background music score, costume designing and make-up.

To complete the movie is a superb soundtrack of 8 songs by the legendary trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. The title song 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is a perfect track for this movie and great motivator. The song 'Maston Ka Jhund' is a upbeat track that makes you want to dance. Also special is 'Slow Motion Angreza' which is a mix of Hindi and English.

It is absolutely wonderful to see such a movie made by Bollywood. The movie cost 5 million dollars to make and has already grossed close to 30 million worldwide. So this proves that movies like this do succeed! I sincerely hope we see more Bollywood movies made based on true stories about Indian athletes.",1398902400,2,3079,4.616087751371115
