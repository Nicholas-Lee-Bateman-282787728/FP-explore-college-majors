2762646,1,B000NA1WGS,"This is a real shame,sure it contains both Road Warrior and its sequel Thunderdome but they are FULL SCREEN VERSIONS,the beautiful camera work cant be enjoyed to the fullest,if it were 1.85 films that might have been somewhat accepable,but these were filmed in 2.35,so you loose allmost 50% of the picture,it;s like getting half a movie!!! Would have been great if they were widescreen transfers,but no such luck here,if you got a Blu Ray player,than get the Road Warrior in that format,heck the price is not much higher than this one!!! Like I said go Blu!!!",1223424000,2,559,4.833333333333333
2762647,5,B000NA1WGS,"I am a fan of those 2 dvd packs. They can be purchased at attractive prices and are space saving at home, for those who like to collect films.
Mad Max 2 and 3 -both - show that a movie does not need Asian fight techniques, kick boxing and kung fu fighting to be interesting, fast and thrilling. It is a solid end time theme with no modern fight inputs and also rarely nowadays: No blood is floating through the films and you don't even miss it. I also like the modern horror and action thriller, but if you see too many of them at a time I think that the way they are made is quite enervating sometimes. That's why I think that Mad Max is a nice vacation from the usual twenty first century standards where blood spills all over, people stay in the air kicking for hours and all you can hear is the f... word. Brilliant young Mel Gibson guarantees that the spectator has a real great time. Fine!",1214611200,5,895,4.179190751445087
2762648,5,B000NA1WGS,sequal to madmax loved it ever since i saw it for the first time. I watch it every other week or so cause its so exciting but still believable  ITS A EXCELLENT MOVIE,1202860800,,165,4.0
2762649,5,B000NA1WGS,I had alot of fun watching. Considering that I'm in Iraq it mad me feel like I was at home.,1194048000,3,91,3.6
2762650,4,B000NA1WGS,"I've always been a fan of the Mad Max movies, but never got to see ""The Road Warrior"" until I found this DVD. It was only $9.99 at Kmart, and I figured, ""2 movies on 1 DVD for 10 bucks, including the one MAD MAX movie I've never seen, sounds great!"" So I bought it, watched it, and loved it!
Alot of people are complaining about the DVDs Full Screen aspect ratio, lack of special features, and poor picture quality... I have to say, I don't know what everyone's talking about... I can't stand Wide Screen (16:9) format, looks like you're squinting all the time! I'll admit, ""The Road Warrior"" didn't have many special features, but ""Beyond Thunder Dome"" had plenty. As for the DVDs picture quality, it looks fine. Although ""Road Warrior"" looked a little fuzzy, it was definitely better than anything I've ever taped off of TV.
I don't regret buying this DVD, and I'm happy with it.
I got 2 great movies on 1 disc for cheap, so I've got nothing to complain about.

If you're like me, and just want to watch MAD MAX 2 & 3 at home on your DVD player, then buy this DVD.
If you're a cinema junky who's obcessed with dual aspect ratios and loads of special features, then you're better off buying each movie separately.",1184284800,10,1214,4.395555555555555
2762651,2,B000NA1WGS,These movies contain subtitles whether you want them or not I found this terrably distracting considering these movies are in english already. I cannot recomend this double feature. If other versions don't have the subtitles I'd go with that.,1183766400,2,242,5.230769230769231
2762652,1,B000NA1WGS,"FULL SCREEN?? Upon waiting and waiting for rerelease of The Road Warrior only to find it an even lesser format is quite a disappointment. Especially having paid for something I would have never wasted the money on if not being MISLED by the product information.

I can only hope someday Warner Bros. will do justice with a decent DVD release of the only worthy & brilliant follow up to Mad Max.",1180137600,13,394,4.549295774647887
2762653,1,B000NA1WGS,"Despite what the Product Details state, both movies are in Full Screen only, what a waste. (Unless you like Full Screen, then you're welcome to it). These movies have a solid audience, why can't Warner Bros. realise this and put out a decent version on DVD? The movies on this disc don't look much better than the ones I taped off television... a decade ago. I would send mine back, but I'd already opened it before I discovered what a ripoof this was. Had the Format been accurately stated, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. Very disappointing.",1179878400,99,560,4.61
2762654,1,B000NA1WGS,There's no excuse for these two films to be full screen only. Even at under $10 bucks it's a major rip-off. A resounding boooooooo to Warner Bros. for this botched double-feature.,1179878400,59,179,4.806451612903226
2762655,1,B000NA1WGS,What a dissapointment. I was anxiously awaiting this disc mainly for the rereleased Road Warrior. Getting Thunderdome was just a bonus. When I received this disc I was depressed to discover no extras for the disc (I thought it would at least have the bonus content that was on the Blu Ray & HD-DVD edition recently released) plus these films are in standard FULL SCREEN! What a waste. Just save your money for the hoped for special edition release later in the year.,1179878400,69,466,4.626506024096385

2762713,3,B000NA1WGS,"It was only three dollars when I got it, which is a good price if you don't own The Road Warrior yet. Hadn't seen Beyond the Thunderdome by the time I bought this, and yeah, everybody was right, it had some good parts but it wasn't really worth my time.
Overall, this is just a bare bones double feature with DVDs that are devoid of compelling special features. If you're a huge fan of The Road Warrior you might want to look elsewhere for a better DVD or Blu Ray edition, but if you just wanted to own it, then this is perfectly fine if you happen to stumble upon it when it's cheap.",1482796800,,584,4.131578947368421

Thinking the price was good for a double feature, I failed to read the number of reviews that pointed out that these are not widescreen versions, but are in fact full screen versions that give you a viewing experience no better than a VHS rental copy on an old 19"" TV from the 1980's.

The third installment was the best in the trilogy and one of my favorite threquels, along with X3: THE LAST STAND, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, THE RETURN OF THE KING, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, T3, or THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.

You have to read the fine print. So a lot of the scenes are cropped funny. It's 1 disc not 2. It's one of those classic reversable Side A and Side B discs. No special features except the classic trailer. Road Warrior is an ok romp. Definately violent and decently scripted. But it just kinda ends and that's that. There's no resolution with the character at all. Thunderdome was horrible, just ridiculously terrible. It goes from almost maybe enjoyable to  ""Wtf, when did I put in 'Hook' and where's Robin Williams"" All of a sudden Max is a babysitter and we are watching a kids movie. And again we get an  instant ending with no reflection or character resolution of any kind. Definately not worth your hard earned cash.

It's cool and weird - silly, in a good way. Eventually, I will replace this 2007, full screen release version with a better, widescreen copy.

I remember the critics, way back then, trashing ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" for it's storytelling shortcomings. They were right. This movie looks great and has some spectacular action scenes, but I can't comprehend why THIS script got O.K.'d for shooting. Well, no doubt it had everything to do with the expected box office returns. This is a perfect example of ""big budget crap.""
