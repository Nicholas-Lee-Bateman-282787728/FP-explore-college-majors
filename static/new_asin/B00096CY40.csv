2267969,5,B00096CY40,"Vol. 5 has Carol Burnett's close friend & ""good luck charm"" (who opened each season's first show) Jim Nabors, whose goofy, folksy comic personality made him a star on first ""The Andy Griffith Show"", and then its spin-off, ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"". A bit of nostalgia opens the show: Carol & Jim look back at themselves (hilariously) on the very first ""Carol Burnett Show"" in 1967. Then, one of the best T.V. show parodies: A nursery-rhyme version of the prime time soap satire, ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"". Carol simply nails the Louise Lasser impersonation here as the lead character, a pig-tailed neurotic on valium. Vicki Lawrence is hilarious as well in her Mary Kay Place role, more proof of her growing comedic talent. And Tim Conway almost steals the show as her Dad who's been running around the neighborhood ""Peek-a-booing"" (a juvenile interpretation of ""flashing""). Conway appears again in a one-man sketch as a weary traveler trying to get some shut-eye--and then disrupted by every hotel distraction imaginable. A good showcase for Conway's physical comedy gifts. A typically overblown production--this time, set in Hawaii--involves the entire cast (ironically, Nabors lives in Hawaii)and wraps up the show.
The other show has returning guests Ken Berry & Carl Reiner. The highlight here has to be a dizzy spoof of the ""Airport"" disaster films which were popular at that time. Even Nora Desmond & Max turn up as passengers (much like guest stars who popped up as passengers in the originals).
Again, there's something in each show to laugh at!",1244073600,14,1550,5.05859375

8057543,3,B00096CY40,"Tim Conway is excellent. Vicki Lawrence was best as Mama, but her other roles in this DVD were not as well scripted.

8057545,1,B00096CY40,"I purchased this dvd as a birthday gift for my sister. When I realized it was only 2 shows, I was upset that it
was so expensive.  I thought I was getting a whole season.  To top it off, the dvd skipped and then just stopped, so
it was a faulty dvd.  Not happy!  I would like to have it at least replaced. I have always been satisfied with
whatever I have ordered from Amazon, but this was a huge disappointment.",1293840000,8,412,4.049382716049383
