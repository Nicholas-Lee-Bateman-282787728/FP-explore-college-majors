As another reviewer noted, ""the roll away"" exercise is terrible on your lower back if you do not have or use your abs correctly. Anyone who expects a fast pace, a tough workout (bootcamp style) should stay away. It will bore you quickly. Yes, if you use the weighted  StayBall (if you can find one) will make it harder and you may start sweating because it uses a lot of muscles but this is not a workout that left me exhausted.

Pros:
-- The video includes two versions of the same work out. The first is 'instructional' and great for true beginners (or for some slightly more advanced if they want to check posture and see how the exercises work) This is rare on most workout DVDs and a nice thing to have the first time you want to do the DVD. The second version is without detailed instructions but it does highlight each exercise again so you don't forget what you are supposed to do.
-- Actual workout time is just shy of 30 minutes
-- Great for beginners because the instructions are easy to follow
-- Some people will love the fact that in each exercise the trainer will actually count out the reps. The exercises are slow, methodological and you can focus on an exercise before rushing to the next.
-- There is a series of exercises that are repeated twice. You do the whole 15 minute series twice with some basic child's pose breathing/stretching at the end of the second series. I think it can be useful for beginners or someone getting back to working out because you don't have to learn 30 minutes of new routines you can really work into these exercises.
-- The DVD even has a menu so you can choose a specific exercise from the 'library' and just make your own workout, which might interest some.

Con:
-- Advanced people will be bored quickly by the slow and steady pace. For me personally the constant counting bored me. Yes, it can allow for more focus but I started to yawn. The exercises are not dynamic in pace.
-- The roll away exercise can cause actual harm if done incorrectly. I don't like that it is included in a series of core workouts that otherwise is reasonably steady and consistent with back and knee friendly exercises.

Overall, it is a well designed DVD with great instruction but just not exciting/exhausting enough for a more avid workout fan.",1471392000,,2343,4.5058823529411764

8067644,5,B0009VS7XC,"I've owned this workout DVD and stayball forever, and just recently pulled it out again. I have to say, this is a great ""first thing in the morning"" workout. Combined with the ""stretch"" part of the dvd, the workout is about 45 minutes long. I have found that all of the excercises are pretty easy on my bad knees and back with the exception of the very last one (roll away). I recommend replacing that with additional crunches while that part is going as I've tweaked my back more than once attempting it.

Minimal (really no) cardio, but a good workout to get you started again, if you've taken a break from any former excercise routine.

*important note* make sure you purchase/use reebok's weighted stayball for this excercise to get its full benefit! The ball is actually weighted with sand which will complete your workout! :)",1268611200,6,831,4.684931506849315
