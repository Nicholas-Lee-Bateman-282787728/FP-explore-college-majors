3120968,5,B0013Z5B8M,"Wow! Ed Friedland is not only a great musician, he's an excellent educator as well. This is a very comprehensive and information-rich video organized in key sections, each building upon the next. Lessons begin with appropriate verbal descriptions followed by brief musical examples. The introductory section reviews the basics of proper hand position, fingering, several playing tips and some classic walking bass line examples.

The techniques section offers many important ideas about playing with other musicians such as: the structure of jazz standards, how to call a tune, various intros, and how to end a tune. These are topics rarely presented in teaching videos or books. Most seasoned jazz musicians simply assume everybody knows this stuff. However, this is the inside info usually gained through years of being on the bandstand...  and by experiencing the embarrassment of screwing up until you finally learn what nobody has ever explained. Ed's coverage of this essential knowledge is itself worth the price of the video.

The performance section offers an opportunity to watch three accomplished and road-savvy musicians play with one another for the first time. Aspiring players will see and hear bass lines ranging from elegantly simple to up-tempo fireworks -- all played by a bassist with graceful mastery and terrific ears. This is a superb teaching video that offers as many lessons on playing the upright bass as it does insights into becoming a professional jazz musician. Probably the finest educational video in my entire collection. Highly recommended!",1326326400,5,1576,5.372469635627531

3120970,5,B0013Z5B8M,"Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a basic beginner or intermediate video course.  Ed says as much in the intro and if  you're new to the instrument you might want to pick up the Todd Phillips DVD's (Vol. 1 & 2) first or, even better, take a few lessons from a jazz oriented instructor.  Having said that there's more good stuff in this almost 2 1/2 hour video than you'll find in any other $18 purchase.  It may take you years to absorb it all but it is accessible and the diligent player will be able to incorporate the material as their own without having to be a musical prodigy.  Most of the video is bits and pieces of technique, theory and stylistic embellishment that you just won't find anywhere else.  There's also a lot of little connective pieces that once viewed, tie together things you probably already know; similar in some respects to Rufus Reid's Evolving Bassist DVD, but Ed's approach is more personal and less ""watch me show you how it's done"".  You can tell Ed's a born teacher not only by the wealth of material he's put out, but how he seems to anticipate those areas that might be a little tricky to grasp.  His basic bass (electric) instruction books for Hal Leonard are top rated and the compilation (of same) is available with a DVD for the true beginner.  Additionally his method book on blues bass and the ""bass builders"" series on the pentatonic scale and bass lines are probably the best in print today.  Finally, one of the under appreciated differences between this video and others on the market is the exceedingly high production values.  This DVD was produced in 2007 so to be fair it does have a leg up on others that go back decades to the VHS days, but having said that both the video and sound show up on my TV as high def and high fidelity; there's no stage blunders that I could detect and the whole package comes off as purely professional from beginning to end.",1293408000,7,1924,4.468571428571429
3120971,5,B0013Z5B8M,"Ed's DVD doesn't start out as if you just bought your bass today--for that you'd be better off with Todd Phillips' DVDs. And Rufus Reid's DVD gives you a little more on walking bass lines and a lot of great esoteric help. But Ed covers a whole lot of stuff in detail that Todd and Rufus don't touch in theirs. For example, various right-hand pizzicato techniques, drops, pull-offs, producing ""growl,"" working in an ensemble with other musicians, basic intros and endings, and much, much more. He doesn't waste any time searching for words; Ed's presentation is well scripted and efficient, and he delivers it very well. The result is a DVD that is jam-packed with information and good demonstrations.

I have Todd's , Ed's, and Rufus's DVDs, and I find them all valuable (and fun) for different reasons. For learning walking bass lines, Ed has a couple of really-good books with CDs devoted just to that subject--and other bassists have good ones, too.",1271030400,15,952,4.840490797546012
3120972,4,B0013Z5B8M,"First things first: If you're looking for instruction on how to walk or construct a bass line- you won't find it here. If, however, you can already play lines- perhaps you're coming from playing bass guitar- and you can find your way around the upright, and you're looking for specific jazz technique- jazz pizzicato, playing drops, that sort of thing- this is a good resource.

Eds shows you these techniques in detail, and then demonstrates them. He shows how different fingering can result in different tonal qualities. There's a small included booklet with transcriptions of some of these examples, too, so you can play along and compare your technique and tone with Ed's. So if you can already play jazz, but you're looking for a good explanation of some of the techniques jazz upright player use- this DVD may be for you.",1241049600,10,827,4.823943661971831

8253708,5,B0013Z5B8M,"I have been playing music for decades. Recently, I took up the electric upright bass. This DVD immediately helped me in several ways.
It clears up the use of the third finger of the left hand, explaining the why and how.
It's very easy to follow and understand, yet gives great tips I was not aware of after looking at dozens of YouTube videos.
Watching Ed play is an inspiration, he's a solid, tasteful player who doesn't need to show off. This is one of the best investments you could make to learn about the instrument.",1327795200,,522,4.447916666666667
8253709,5,B0013Z5B8M,"I'm lucky enough to have had lessons with Ed for a number of years and this video is just like a private lesson due to the direct approach and clarity of concepts.

I took up the Upright Bass just over a year ago and Ed's video helped greatly. The material contains enough theory, practical technique, concepts and advice to keep you going for years. I often refer back to it - there is so much to work on but you can break it down into segments, unlike a lot of instruction videos that just throw massive amounts of information and 'hot licks' without any thought as to logical progression.",1327708800,,591,4.422018348623853
